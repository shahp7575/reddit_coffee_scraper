1kktguq,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1kktguq/the_strange_way_peasents_found_out_that_i_was/,the strange way peasents found out that I was wealthy.,"Mid-2024. I was 21, doing my summer internship at a well-known tech company in Noida. I was pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science from a top college in Delhi. (You know the type‚Äîbragging rights come included with your ID card.)

Now, I come from what people call an ‚Äúold money‚Äù family. Not the flashy Insta-reel kind. Think big bungalows, understated luxury, a library curated by a bibliophile grandfather, and a family history that includes one of the largest sugar mills in North India back in the 60s. We‚Äôve been rich longer than Gucci has made belts. But my parents raised me on humility and logic. No brat energy allowed.

So when I got the internship, I decided to go low-key. For fun. A little social experiment of sorts. I ditched my BMW (a birthday gift), left the Ferrari and Porsche to collect dust, and told the driver to take a break. Instead, I took the Metro. I‚Äôd never been on it before. It felt‚Ä¶ grounding. Real. Slightly sweaty, but convenient.

At work, I met this wonderful group of interns‚Äî5 or 6 of them from different colleges. We hit it off instantly. They were funny, smart, down-to-earth. No filters or pretenses. I loved it. We‚Äôd go for golgappas after work, bond over code, memes, and occasionally Sanskrit verses (guilty as charged). I kept things simple‚Äîrecycled my Pumas, carried my slightly dated iPhone 13 Pro Max, and used an E-rickshaw like the average Noida soul.

I wasn‚Äôt faking anything. I just wasn‚Äôt displaying anything.

Then came The Day.

Mid-August. Classic Noida downpour, the kind that feels personal. After work, we were all huddled under the office gate, watching the rain refuse to stop. Two folks left in cabs. I waited it out a bit. No E-rickshaw in sight. My shoes were beginning to weep.

So, I texted my driver. He had the Rolls that day.

Five minutes later, a white Rolls-Royce Ghost pulled up, smooth as a whisper. The chauffeur stepped out with an umbrella, opened the door, and I just nodded at my stunned friends, said a casual ‚ÄúBye guys,‚Äù and stepped in.

It was dead silence. The kind of silence that comes with seven crores of metal and leather gliding away from you.

The next day, they asked. Politely. Like they didn‚Äôt just watch me get into the Batmobile. I told them the truth.

That I lived in a mansion in one of Noida‚Äôs poshest sectors. That my dad was a multi-millionaire businessman. That the Rolls wasn‚Äôt the only beast in the garage. That I‚Äôd been to over 20 countries, had a personal library at home, and a chef who cooked like he had Michelin stars hidden in his spice rack.

They were stunned. But what I appreciated? They didn‚Äôt treat me differently. Not then, not after. We were still the same squad who laughed over momos and hated debugging at 2 AM.

At the end of the internship, I invited them to my place for lunch. That was the only time I let the luxury show itself. Huge bungalow, yes. Lavish interiors, yes. But the highlight? The conversations. The warmth. The laughter. The fact that my friends didn‚Äôt care if I had a Ferrari; they cared that I showed up every day like one of them.

Now, I‚Äôm working at a top-tier tech firm, doing what I love. I still don‚Äôt want to take over the family business. It‚Äôs not my calling. I‚Äôd rather write clean code than balance balance sheets.

One of my friends from the internship‚Äîhe‚Äôs into spirituality like I am‚Äîwe recently caught up over coffee at a lounge in South Delhi. We laughed about the ‚ÄúRolls-Royce Incident‚Äù and how I accidentally pulled the most low-key rich-girl reveal of all time.",1,1747059002.0,delhi,0,0.6,False

These are my first multies. Other than computer glasses.

I'm 190cm/6'3"" and they're brilliant for driving or using my phone.

But rubbish for walking around construction sites with trip hazards, walking in the bush, running or even finding stuff in the supermarket. Even walking around home annoys me. Sitting down the stuff on the coffee table is still out of focus.

Anything less than 8m away on the ground, or below the line from my eyes to the ground 8m away is out of focus. It's all caught up in my mid range vision. They keep lowering the frames and the centre point in the lenses, but I basically have to hang them off the end of my nose to walk around and see stuff or take them off for the 2m to 8m range.

And my peripheral is stuffed. I basically have to stand square onto stuff and not move my eyes.

I used masking tape to show them where I need the lense in focus. They tell me progressives can't lower the mid range height in the lense.

Is this true? Or are Varilux XR just designed for driving, watching TV or your phone? This isn't my lifestyle at all. I'm active outdoors and hate sitting down.

The prescription is all fine. I just have to shift the progessive lenses to see when moving around being active. Contacts work fine for distance and computer glasses work fine with that prescription.

I really just want the multies for everyday use unless on a computer, so moving around and reading at a pinch but not the priority.

1. So I've been thinking about this for a while and havent really gotten a clear answer because I feel like it's sort of a complicated topic in christianity. What I mean by smoking is only nicotine. So just vapes and cigarettes and not weed or anything else. But the question is sort of complicated for me because to my knowledge the only thing to stuff like that that's in the bible is where it says that getting drunk is a sin because it changes the way you act or something but your still allowed to drink as long as it's not overdone. And smoking/vaping does kinda change you but to me it's more like how coffee has an affect on you than how getting drunk does. So I would appreciate an answer

2. If your answer to the first part is that it's ok to smoke as a christian as long as it's just nicotine then my second question is what if the person smoking is underage. Like I get it's illegal but aside from that, only based on the laws of the bible what's the stand on that?

1kktffp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TempestRising/comments/1kktffp/asymmetric_mostly_shafts_tempest_dynasty/,Asymmetric mostly shafts Tempest Dynasty,"This been bothering me for a while now, so allow me to get my thoughts organized.  
Tempest Rising is a game with two playable factions with asymmetric design. Cool, great, this is pretty much a hallmark of every RTS that came out after Warcraft II, and C&C is famous for it.  
Yet in nearly every ""comparable but different"" set of units, we find that the Tempest Dynasty gets shafted, with the GDF counterpart coming out looking much prettier, shinier, better, etc. What's worse, we can easily find how many of these tiny differences multiply and compound, with the final ""performance difference"" significantly larger than what the myriad performance disparities might initially suggest.  

First, let's start with non-unit faction details: **Base construction**! Yeah, DYN gets a turd sandwich here, because it uses the old Red Alert/Tiberium Sun base building method of ""click to construct, then click to deploy"" Here, the deployment part is much slower, but that's a tiny detail. DYN can ""technically"" queue up buildings for construction, but they do not progress until you've deployed the constructed building first. The GDF, on the other hand, can queue up an entire base and then go make themself a coffee (with the downside of ""i can kill your building while it is still a construction site"").  
Related to base construction is **Basic economy**: GDF's initial mining is faster and easier to set up, requiring fewer clicks. Let's set up a Tempest Rig! Click to make a Machine Shop (1300, 30s), then click to plop it down once it is ready. Click to make a Tempest Rig (1800, 36s), then order it to go set up somewhere. Wow, we're done! 3100 resources, 66 seconds (plus a goodly amount of time needed for the Rig to move to the deposit and deploy). Refinery? Click to plop down a Power Plant (600, 14 seconds), then click to plop down the Refinery after it is done (2100, 30 seconds). Oh, would you look at that, it's already mining, 2700 tempest and 44 seconds later, with at least half the clicks! The GDF can use those clicks it saved up to go look around the map, get maybe work towards compensating for their initial Local View Only radar and... oh, no, wait, nevermind.  
**Radar** is just another one of the areas where DYN gets shafted instead. It is absolutely just outright rude that DYN doesn't start with the map revealed the way GDF does. With experience, you learn the maps and don't rely on the battlemap for orientation as much, but then you start playing a new map, or a new map gets released, and you're shafted again. It affects newer players much more than experienced ones, and becomes irrelevant later on, so I can only describe this little bit of asymmetry as *asinine*.  
Before we move on, can we mention **Intel** first? It isn't ""a unique resource you need to specifically do things to obtain"", you get it by playing the game. It boils down to either a flat discount on mixed cost units, or just outright free units. 

Okay, let's start meaningfully comparing some units now, okay?  
**Havoc** vs **Sentinel**! First thing you'll not notice until you go wait, what, where, how, why? is the undocumented change of Havocs losing their transport capability until you upgrade the ConYard to the Bastion. Was that made so that you can't zip Engineers around the map in the early game? Probably. But that's not the only undocumented change with these two, oh no! The Sentinel also has one! But that one's a buff, see. It gets Marking on the basic gun now (Scanner rounds just give extra range and AoE Marking, but at a quarter of the DPS).  
Now, in a straight-up fight, the Havocs will slaughter Sentinels, true, but GDF gets to field Hunter tanks in T1, and the two work as a wonderful 2500-range blob of anti-vehicle and anti-infantry and anti-air that the DYN just simply can't engage with until T2, at all. Sentinels are cheaper (500 vs 700), faster to build (10 vs 20 seconds), and the GDF player can just pump out a few to guard key locations on the map to prevent any early guard garrison or engineer capture; the Havoc sucks at this task, and the DYN has nothing else to accomplish the same task.  
Speaking of **Hunter** tanks, why are they a full tier earlier than **Boar** tanks, that are much more expensive (800 vs 1100), much slower to build (16 vs 32 seconds), but only marginally tougher (560 vs 780 health, but significantly better armor), while having a significant range advantage (2600 vs 2000)? In most direct fights, Hunters win, despite the fact that the Boar takes twice the Hunter shots to blow up than vice versa. Mostly due to range, economy, head start in pumping them out, overall greater mobility, as well as Comms and Networking (which turn close match-ups to absolute stomps).  
Oh, but don't worry, DYN has a tier 1 tank, too! It's the **Pillager**, and it *sucks*! It is also bugged, in that it will stop and ""attack"" a target that is not actually in range, so it just stand there, breathing fire at the enemy, menacingly, while also preventing the rest of your army from moving up and connecting with the target. Can we spend a moment talking about how useless this unit is, please? It is designed as a vehicle to counter infantry, but the GDF counter-vehicle infantry unit has such an enormous range advantage (and is potentially in the air, too!), that it is just futile to engage those with them, and they really don't need Field Scouts when the DronOs are just so damn strong... Oh, it dies and leaves an Ignitor? Neat, I guess? GDF gets an additional tiny bonus point here for having a good and reasonably mobile T1 medium armor unit to run over infantry with, which DYN just doesn't (Pillager sucks too much, Rig is not a serious point to consider).  

Oh, that reminds me. **Early infantry**! First, get ready for some more crap: DYN Barracks require a Machine Shop, instead of the other way round. Additionally, GDF can rush Barracks before setting up economy, DYN can't. Earliest possible Guard is 53 seconds, costing 2050, while earliest possiblee Scout is 26 seconds, costing 820. Guards are cheaper (150 vs 220) and hardier (140 vs 120 HP), but their offensive capabilities are shit (9 DPS vs 17, at 1850 range vs 2500). Additionally, GDF needs very, very few Field Scouts at all; their basic vehicle is a very good, very fast anti-infantry/anti-air unit with good range and significant economic advantages. Instead, the GDF can focus on pumping out Engineers, or Drone Operators, who are absolutely broken in stats, unit behaviour, field presence, garrison capability, micro intensification, etc.  
Compared to the **Missile Trooper**, the **Drone Operator** is marginally more expensive (350 vs 300), marginally slower to build (10 vs 8 seconds), but has *much* more HP (160 vs 100 base, plus the 100 HP drone), has double the DPS, a cannon-type sidearm (lol), the drones respawn, the drones attack while in a transport, the drones are a flying unit, the drones have attack AND operational range, the drones can attack while the DronO retreats, the drones offer directable flying vision (!!!), the drones can stealth, the drones respawn *for free*, the drones confuse AI/unattended targeting priority, the drones know where they are at all times because the drones know where they aren't... This is the most obvious, blatant ""yeah, OP"" thing on the DYNvsGDF comparison list, and the list of unique super-special advantages is hilarious indeed. Oh, but despair not! The Missile Trooper can Sprint! For cost, the GDF wins both Havoc-vs-DronO and Sentinel-vs-MissTroop, and it's not particularly close, either.  

With these few out of the way, I want to just sum them all up into one thing that they all multiply into: DYN has a MUCH higher control intensity requirement, both micro and macro. Units have lower ranges across the board, need to be babysat and organized into formations specifically for engagements every few seconds, any attention diverted from combat for macro is automatically doubled or more... The GDF is a ""force multiplier"" faction, but all of the force multiplication (Comms, Network/Mark) is passive, and requires no specific input from the user; just attack-move or formation-move the blob every now and then, and you're golden.  
Alright, now that I've spelled out that bit, let's move on.  

The factions' **High Tech Units**!  
The **Voltaic Tank** is almost good. It does not compare particularly well to the Trebuchet, but it isn't dire; it is more population intensive (4 vs 3) and takes longer to build (36 vs 25 seconds), while cheaper (1700 vs 2100) to build, and offering better DPS (33 vs 25) at marginally better range (2850 vs 2500). But then the Trebuchet deploys, getting nearly double the range, or Networks for almost triple the range, and the DPS comparison goes right out the window if someone brings a Comms unit or Marks the target (with both, they have ~double the DPS of a Voltaic). The Voltaic has two very neat tricks, in that it insta-kills tempested vehicles (unreliable and not easy to secure this boost), and it shuts down buildings on hit. The problems arise in the timing, mainly. As a T3 unit, and a medium vehicle with medium armor (it is an up-gunned Boar, basically), it really finds difficulty in finding a niche in which it is effective. It is outranged by the Porcupine (can we PLEASE have a ""Hold Fire"" ability for that one, already?), out-tanked by the Boar, can't detect, can't attack air... it doesn't really bring anything exactly new to the table.  
The **B A L L** is not good. All of those ""can't find a purpose"" things I mentioned for Voltaic above, they go double for this thing. Yes, it is a big ball of hit-points, but it is still obvious, large, expensive (2800!), takes a whole minute to build, doesn't do Omni damage (if anything, this really should do Omni damage), exclusively melee that isn't particularly fast, has dreadful pathfinding, zero shove priority, high-damage low-speed attack (while it really should be the other way around)... All of the lessons of a decade of Ultralist uselessness thoroughly unlearned. This doesn't even compare to any other unit, since it is unique, but... Can we give it omni damage? Boar-like armor? Transport capacity? Detection? Anything?  

Very tiny niche things now:  
GDF Refineries are also Silos, and they can be upgraded to provide free income. The DYN free income counterpart is late in a doctrine tree, expensive to get to, and doesn't scale, but at just one plan and one research, it does pull weight.  
Island-hopping is a very specific capability: It is the ability to cross oceans and chasms and other ground-unit-inaccessible areas, and start building a base over yonder. The maps in Tempest Rising so far have zero islands, yes, but they do feature a lot of ground movement block areas and chokepoints, so the ability to go around them should be noted. The GDF has island-hopping, DYN doesn't. Not only does the GDF have it, it has TWO ways of doing it: Skycrane an upgraded Comms Rig (expensive, late-game, slow), or Support Beacon (early, cheap, fast. Could we maybe give the very expensive Field Infirmary a modest build radius, perhaps?  
DYN units are slower on the whole, yes, but it feels like their turn and turret traverse speeds are slower, too. This is a tiny point (yay, welcome to the section!), but it does affect overall combat performance. Dunno what else to say or suggest about this, just wanted to note that it is a thing.  
Sending an Engineer to capture a Tempest Rig gives you a fully functional mining station; Wheels respawn if killed, and you don't have to (can't, even!) make them in a factory. Sending a Technician to capture a Refinery does... nothing, unless the refinery has been upgraded? The send-rigs-out-and-eat-the-map advantage DYN supposedly has can be compensated for with this (it is impossible to defend all the rigs, as doing so negates the spread advantage).  
GDF aircraft get in-air refueling, DYN don't. Well, the Leveler almost looks like a unit that needs ammo, but doesn't, and the performance kinda goes along with that bit, but the others, particularly the defensive **Dragonfly**, I just... I don't know, it rubs me wrong. DYN anti-air is very limited, and they don't have the absolute beast of a non-multiplying force multiplier that is the Shieldmaiden anywhere in their roster.  
Flame Turrets are useless. The anti-vehicle/building infantry outranges them (and they also suffer from the intimidating fire breath attack bug, like Pillagers), and their attack takes longer to kill an Engineer than for said Engineer to capture most none-core buildings. In a DYNvsGDF matchup, it is almost never constructed, because infantry in that sort of range is not what the GDF fields at all, and the turret's anti-vehicle performance is abysmal (if it can even attack it due to range). The GDF gets the absolutely lovely Gatling Turret instead, which is cheaper, has better range, can attack air, builds faster, and even has detection.  
Now that I mentioned **Detection**... Why are there no DYN **Stealth** units? The guys famous for underhanded, sneaky tactics have a grand total of ONE stealth unit, are you for real? Additionally, why do the guys-with-stealth-whose-enemy-is-not-stealth get free detection in their very good, all-rounder Gatling Turret, but the guys-with-no-stealth-whose-enemy-is-stealth need specialized spotlight buildings for it? Also, why don't Specialist Bureaus and Sensor Arrays get Flying Vision, just to slightly compensate for the GDF drones?

To close out, I want to say that it is not all bad, despite what you read just now. I did say that *nearly* all the differences slant in one direction, but not *all*. DYN has a few advantages, a few saving graces.   Havoc spam is effective, and most people haven't learned how to counter it yet. Assault Gunners and Levelers are good units that fill a much-needed role in a very competent way. Tempest Rigs can spread out to eat the map faster and cheaper than Beacon+Refinery.  
On the whole, though...

No, it wasn't restful-- but it was exactly what I wanted because I planned it! It was so nice being out and about with my kids. I got free coffees at 2 restaurants, some carnations, free ice cream, and my kids made me some hilariously adorable artwork.

I am up too early due to two brat cats who felt like they were both dying of starvation, and wouldn't leave me alone...so please forgive my lack of imagination for a title.

I work 2nd shift, so I am sitting here trying to enjoy my coffee, knowing I will need a nap later or my shift tonight is going to be miserable.  But, I have dealt with worse in the past, and I will get through.

We are currently going through a heatwave here in MN, and I am enjoying the beauty of it all.  Spent a lot of time working in the yard this past weekend, and still a bit more work to go before I am happy with it.

Not sure what it is I am looking for at this point in my life, but I know I miss the companionship of someone in my day to day.  I know better than to go searching in the dark, but I have had decent luck on Reddit in the past...but like most things, they don't last.

I enjoy all different types of conversations, and interactions here.  It all depends on the flow and the connection that is made.  I am looking in MN, or close by, because eventually I would like an opportunity to meet, but also open to something just online.

The trio friendship in the Season 3 of White Lotus actually was a great depiction of how your vulnerabilities and low points can be weaponised against you. The break downs were real, the estrangement was quick.

I'm a junior high student, currently in the same class as my ex-best friend‚Äîlet‚Äôs call her Ari. We've been classmates since middle school. She‚Äôs six months younger than me, and we used to be inseparable‚Äîalways hanging out, sharing secrets, and spending time at coffee shops. I often gave her gifts; that‚Äôs just how I show love.

Over time, our duo became a trio, then a quartet, a quintet‚Äîthen eventually just the two of us again. We both made it into the same advanced class, where I became close friends with a guy named Nate. I liked him at first, but he had a girlfriend, so we stayed just friends. Ari and another classmate, Kie, thought we were dating because we talked a lot‚Äîmostly about an organization we were in.

In March 2024, a guy from that organization, Sein, confessed he liked me. I gently rejected him but said we could still be friends. Sein‚Äôs best friend, Jai, started dating Kris‚Äîmy classmate, who‚Äôs known for causing drama. Kris accused me of being in a secret relationship with Nate and of sending explicit messages‚Äînone of which were true. She also stole from me and cursed me out for not spending enough time with her. I confided everything to Ari, hoping she'd have my back.

Despite everything, I tried to keep the peace in the organization and continued hanging out with them. Eventually, I cut off contact with Kris and Sein, but stayed friends with Jai, who hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong.

Earlier in 2024, I started talking to a guy named Ric. We hit it off and began dating in August after he transferred to my school. Even after that, I still made time for Ari and Kie. In November, I gave them gifts to celebrate our friendship anniversaries. They accepted them, but not long after, they drifted away to hang out with others. By December‚Äîon my birthday‚ÄîAri messaged me to say our friendship was over, accusing me of choosing my boyfriend over them.

Later, I found out Ari had been spending time with Kris, who had been calling me names for dating Ric. Ari and her group spread rumors, called me a bad friend, and even made up lies about me to my family. Lexi, another mutual friend, told me they were talking badly about her too. We agreed to ignore them unless it was absolutely necessary for school.

Now Ari says I made her feel left out, even though she‚Äôs the one who ended our friendship. Kei sided with her, saying I threw away two years of friendship for a five-day relationship‚Äîwithout knowing the full story or that I had already known Ric before he transferred. Nate distanced himself because of the rumors, and my boyfriend still doesn‚Äôt know any of this. I don‚Äôt want to burden him with drama he doesn‚Äôt deserve.

Ric and I are still together‚Äîwe just celebrated our nine months. And for any of you who's wondering, our families know we're dating.",1,1747058329.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm kicking off a coffee consulting business, and would genuinely appreciate any advice or insight from this community as I begin the journey. 

A bit of background: 
My business partner and I bootstrapped a coffee company in Austin, TX that includes both a roasting operation and a coffee trailer. We‚Äôve been at it for over a year, turned a profit in year one, and now have two full-time baristas. I handle operations; my business partner focuses on product. We both have full time jobs and families (3 kids each), so weekends were our grind-literally and figuratively- until we gained enough traction to grow the team. 

We made plenty of mistakes, learned fast, and made decisions that helped us scale sustainably. That‚Äôs what inspired the next step.

The goal:
- Help others break into the coffee trailer business. 
- Build and sell affordable, functional coffee trailers (targeting <$10k).
- Share real lessons from our failures and wins. 
- Offer roasted coffee to our trailer buyers as part of the ecosystem. 

I want this to be a one-stop shop for aspiring mobile coffee business owners - backed by real-world experience. 

If you are in Austin, TX and want to connect, or just have ideas or feedback, I‚Äôd love to chat!

We have been together maybe 6/7 years as a couple, good friends awhile before that.

He is SO messy, unmotivated, and lazy. I love this man so much, he is my best friend and we are on the same wavelength in a lot of ways, but this side of him has been slowly destroying how I feel about him for quite awhile.

Examples (warning it is bad) he does not clean whatsoever. If a cat throws up or has an accident on the floor, he will ignore it if it's on his bedroom floor. Elsewhere in the house he might pick it up, but he won't actually clean the soiled spot to remove stains. If he spills food or drink he does the bare minimum. For instance he spilled some coffee the other day and just took a paper towel over it, and completely left a brown coffee stain in our rug for me to clean. He leaves food on the floor by his chair, to which our cats will get into and then get food everywhere by ripping it apart. He throws his clothes by the litterbox and our cats will drag it into the litter and he doesn't give a damn. We have separate bedrooms cause he is too much (it started because he snores and kicks in his sleep) but even if that went away I'm too grossed out by his messiness. 

He doesn't take care of himself, lacks ambition, and is constantly ignoring things or being stupid. The other day he had an HVAC person stop by to check out the AC, and failed to ask how much it would cost. Cost us 150 bucks for 10 minutes of labor. That was all the money we had. Then just last night something went wrong with his car at work. I told him to leave his car at work and I would pick him up, we would figure it out in the morning. He proceeds to ignore my advice, try to drive home, and his car died so now it is parked in the middle of the city. We are broke and can't afford to have it towed to home or a shop, wouldn't even be able to afford a shop visit right now so need it towed to our house and eventually a shop...

When he is off work he does nothing. He doesn't have any hobbies, does nothing around the house. No ambition for anything. If I wasn't here he'd just lay in bed all day and smoke or drink and play video games (he cuts back on smoking around me because I told him I dislike it), but he still does it behind my back sometimes and ugh.

He is quite overweight and has never seriously tried losing it or getting in shape. He has messed up teeth and once had braces, but took them off early cause he's too impatient and didn't want to be judged for having braces. He never brushes his teeth and lacks personal hygiene. He legit just does not care to take care of himself. He puts NO effort in for me or himself. He has a nice build to work off of and deep blue eyes, he would look absolutely phenomenal if he actually tried.

We haven't had sex in months and who knows when we ever will. I think I've built up resentments and ick over the years, it is hard to look at him and feel any arousel because I just get the ick. He has also been caught in a lot of lies and that kills any attraction further...

As I type all this out...idk what I'm doing. I do love my husband to death and we are SO SO very close, I can't picture life without him. But I just know things have been going south. What little attraction I had is so tiny now because of the laziness, messiness, and resentments. My mind thinks to the future and I'd probably be stupid to have a kid with this man. All work would fall on me, childcare, cleaning, and all the money management. 

We have had NUMEROUS conversations about these things. I ask him to do any small thing and he just WONT LISTEN. Dishes fall on me, and I've asked so many times if he could just rinse his plate and stop putting food in the sink, he doesn't change. I've asked so many times to pick up his clothes or clean the litterbox, if I'm not home the box will become hard as a rock full of shit. When I give him advice he just ignores it and does whatever he wants to do. I can't trust him to take care of adult things. Few months ago he told me he had been taking care of bills, turns out he ignored them all and I eventually had to pay months worth of bills. He hasn't even gotten his car registered yet. He puts everything off, ignores responsibilities and thinks they will disappear. I don't want this relationship to end (he has a lot of good qualities still), but looking at it realistically it will always be a stressful roommate-like relationship I think... I know what the SMART thing to do would be... is there any hope he can ever get his shit together? He loves me DEARLY and is a complete sweetheart of a man, he is practically homer and I'm marge. Homer is sweet but he's a total slob and dumb ass who is constantly letting marge down with his stupid antics or just getting drunk and being lazy. At least homer sometimes has some wacky fun ideas, my husband is stuck in the scene where Homer's thought bubble is the toy monkey smashing together the cymbals

About a month ago I moved from my home state in the US, to Saudi Arabia to be with my husband (who I absolutely adore and love so much). It's not the lifestyle or cultural differences that are making me depressed, it's that l spend a lot of time alone, as my husband works in another city Sunday morning-Thursday morning, and I don't have many friends here. When I lived back in the states I literally had dozens of friends, over 30 people came to my going away party the night before I moved. I always had something to do, and now I just mostly clean, hangout with my 2 kittens, and sleep. I've been sleeping around 16 hours a day, which I've only ever done during depressive episodes (I have bi polar type 1) so l'm getting concerned. My husband says he feels bad and wants to help me establish a routine, and is bringing a car from the city he works next month, so I can drive and have a vehicle to us. All his cars here are manual and I only know automatic cars. So he's trying to help, he offered me a gym membership, and is encouraging for me to take classes at a university once I get my long term visa that permits me to go to uni here. And as for his family, they're super friendly, accepting and loving of me, but I just don't have the motivation to hangout with them often or without him. Last week I had coffee with his mom one day and then went to the beach with her another day and it was nice, but I just kept thinking about how much more fun it would had been with my friends from back home, or my own mom. I think I'm feeling homesick and missing friends and family more than I anticipated I would, even just the foods I'm used to and activities I'm used to. It's a way bigger adjustment than I had thought it would be before I moved here. I don't regret my decision at all, and I don't want to move back to the US, I just want to feel happier here : (I can't even find motivation to do things I normally love doing, like cooking, making art, painting, listening to music and dancing, literally nothing interests me anymore.

I really want to know because I don‚Äôt think you are. I know you. I know I do.

I know how you keep almost everything inside. I know how you isolate yourself. Hiding feels safe. Avoiding protects you from feeling. I know you carry such a heavy burden - guilt and shame that‚Äôs too much to carry alone. Sometimes you smile through the pain, but the persistent tension in your jaw reveals the truth. I saw how you looked at your son with love and fear tangled together. You looked at me that way too.

It feels like you‚Äôre hiding from me, but I know you‚Äôre really hiding from yourself - from pain, fear, shame, the truth. The truth of what you walked away from: healing, growth, love. Something real.

I‚Äôve accepted the truth. Now I‚Äôm trying to live in an intolerable reality. You‚Äôre gone. You‚Äôre not coming back. The fog is too thick. I stood still while you vanished into chaos. The fog is lifting now, and you‚Äôre nowhere to be found. The trail has gone cold. The chaos you embraced leaves no trace. The light we shared has been extinguished.
I‚Äôve been erased.

I shouldn‚Äôt care anymore, but I do. I always will. Wondering how you are. How your son is. How our dog is. 

Yesterday was Mother‚Äôs Day. Was it special? Was it fulfilling? Were you honored? Did you forget about your pain for a little while?

I spent a lot of time planning a special gift for you - a book of photos, holding years of precious memories. It never materialized because there‚Äôs no way to deliver it. Not when you‚Äôre behind an impenetrable wall.

My mind wandered into fantasy. How I would have bought you flowers and put them in your son‚Äôs hands, told him to bring them to you, knowing they were from us both. I‚Äôd bring you coffee and breakfast like I always did - but with an extra flourish to mark the day. And if the opportunity presented itself, I would offer you the deepest pleasure I could provide.

The day would have been filled with music, smiles, laughter, warmth, affection, and gratitude. I really hope you had something like that.

Tomorrow is your birthday. My heart is heavy and tangled. The regret I carry from last year - how I tried so hard to do what I thought was right. To work and provide or to be there all day with you and your family. I know what I would do if I had a second chance.

I know I made a mistake.
Maybe someday I‚Äôll forgive myself.
Even if you never do.

The pain of that day will echo for a long time. I did show up, but I missed the best parts. And I didn‚Äôt know what to say or do. I was frozen. The party rolled on, but then an old wound with your brother surfaced. You fell apart. Everything fell apart.

I saw the grief pouring out of you. The wound that doesn‚Äôt heal.

If only I had chosen differently. Maybe everything would have played out in a very different timeline. Maybe I‚Äôd be planning your special day tomorrow. But I‚Äôm not. And all I have is the hope that it will be truly special anyway - that those who genuinely care about you will celebrate you properly.

But it‚Äôs not just about yesterday or tomorrow. Yes, they‚Äôre special days, but every day that follows carries similar weight - the weight of a question I can‚Äôt ask, and you won‚Äôt answer:

Are you okay?

Part of me will always want to know.

Without taking these too seriously, I hope you enjoy my highlights and (relative) lowlights from a delightful week spent deepening my whisky knowledge at Spirit of Speyside.

**Best Whisky Tasting: Gordon & MacPhail**

Gordon & MacPhail has become my favorite independent bottler after this trip, and their in-store tastings are a big reason why. I ended up trying around a dozen G&M expressions across two tastings and a few store visits, and all of them were high-quality, complex drams. On my final day in Speyside, I got to do one final sit-down there, a one-on-one tasting led by Russell. It started‚ÄìI repeat, it *started*‚Äìwith an 18-year-old Ardmore and culminated in a Caol Ila older than I am. And because G&M‚Äôs people are true whisky fans, the conversation was even better than the whisky. As anyone who's gone to a tasting can attest, it makes a huge difference to talk to a fellow whisky nerd compared to someone who's just regurgitating marketing material. That's not a problem at G&M.

**Best Distillery Bar: Benriach**

This one is a really close call and comes down to personal preferences and style. I liked Benriach for its clean, unfussy cafe-like layout, which had more than enough space for a person to bring a good group of friends and explore every nook and cranny of Benriach‚Äôs extensive whisky portfolio. Although small, Benriach‚Äôs bar had one of the widest selections of any distillery bar I saw, with a whole library shelf of archival drams starting in the 1970s and carrying on to the present day. Oh, and pretty views overlooking the cherry blossoms and Benriach-branded warehouse outside too. Others may prefer the similar space at GlenAllachie, and I wouldn't gainsay them. The Macallan definitely has the most futuristic and sleek bar, which looks like it came straight out of a space-station Park Hyatt, but the jaw-dropping prices didn't make it feel like a place anyone would really hang out.

**Worst Distillery Bar: the one that doesn‚Äôt exist yet ‚Ä¶**¬†

Get to building, people!

**Best Whisky I Drank: Gordon & MacPhail Inchgower 1998, 26 y.o.**

Picking a favorite whisky after a once-in-a-lifetime trip is a really tough call, especially since I tried about 90 whiskies during my 10 days in Scotland. One of those, Glenfarclas‚Äôs 1963 Family Cask, was the oldest whisky I've ever had, both in terms of distillation year and maturation time (51 years). Other standout drams included GlenAllachie‚Äôs 11-year-old Mizunara Single Cask released for Spirit of Speyside, a 44-year-old Glenrothes estate single cask, the legendary Ardbeg Airigh Nam Beist, a 15-year-old 2006 Glenfarclas Family Cask, and a G&M Caol Ila from 1984. But this dram from the little-known Inchgower won my heart because it nailed a flavor profile that I adore: coffee, chocolate, and dark berries. Probably didn't hurt that I had this one with a decadent truffle agnolotti either.

**Worst Whisky I Drank:** **Murray McDavid GlenAllachie 2014 Barolo Wine Barrique, 9 y.o.**¬†

This was an even tougher ‚Äúaward‚Äù to pick than the previous one, and it‚Äôs necessarily going to be one that reflects my personal biases rather than the objective quality of the juice. For some reason, wine-finished whisky is the most hit-and-miss cask type for my palate, and the stronger the wine maturation or finish, the worse it can get. I am pretty comfortable with high-tannin wines but somehow that same tannic character really throws me off in a whisky and manifests as a metallic, sharp tang. Anyways, despite my aversion, I still tried several wine-cask-matured whiskies on this trip, always curious to see whether my palate has shifted over time. Largely thanks to its wine maturation, this youthful, punchy GlenAllachie wins my personal Razzie for worst whisky of the trip.

**Best Recovery Activity: Sauna at the Kings**

This little Scandinavian touch to my Scottish road trip was a wonderful way to clear my head after several days of whisky tasting. After working up a sweat in this cozy beachside sauna, I ran straight into the chilly but bracing North Sea, shocking myself into a heightened state of awareness and energy. Highly recommended for everyone who visits Speyside, this place is an easily accessible half hour or so from Elgin or Rothes, and just about 10 minutes more from Aberlour, Craigellachie, or Dufftown.

**Best Festival Bottle - GlenAllachie 2013 Oloroso and Mizunara Finish Single Cask, Spirit of Speyside 2025 Exclusive, 11 y.o.**

In fairness, I tried only four of this year‚Äôs festival exclusives: Glenfarclas, GlenAllachie, Craigellachie, and Aultmore. So I can't speak to the quality of some of the ones I missed, like Speyburn, Glenfiddich, or Murray McDavid. Among the whiskies I did sample, they ranged from good to excellent, and I'm confident each would earn some first-place votes at a blind tasting because they were quite different from one another. The Aultmore is a sherry bomb, the Craigellachie has a flintier character, the Glenfarclas is much maltier, and then the GlenAllachie is a bewitching combination of different cask maturations, which ultimately won me over with its complexity and uniqueness. This whisky started with several years in a bourbon barrel before spending a brief spell in a red wine cask, then multi-year stints in both Oloroso sherry and the rare and pricey Japanese Mizunara oak cask‚Äìwhich costs 3,500 pounds to buy. Sometimes that many different casks can be a red flag that the whisky is struggling to develop a good flavor profile, but here it somehow works. This is a rich, coconut and cocoa powder-laced dram and, best of all, it was actually the cheapest of the four festival exclusives at a very manageable 100 pounds.

**Most Unique Festival Event: Craigellachie Aperitivo Hour**

Most tastings follow a conventional format: sit down in a nice bar, restaurant, or distillery visitors center with four (or five, or six) glasses arrayed in front of you, listen to a bit of background about the distillery and its history first, and then go through the whiskies one by one while the presenter and guests exchange tasting notes and ask questions. Craigellachie‚Äôs aperitivo hour shakes that formula up in a few ways, starting with a gorgeous outdoors setting on the strand by the river Spey, right under the picturesque old Craigellachie bridge. They also make this event extremely accessible, pricing it at only 8 pounds‚Äìand that price goes to local civic charities. Finally, they bring a bravura lineup of whiskies; this year‚Äôs featured the festival exclusives from Aultmore and Craigellachie, and then a 41-year-old Craigellachie from the Exceptional Cask Series. The generous, fun, and informal atmosphere makes this more like a whisky society or whisky club party than a distillery-led tasting. Bravo, Craigellachie.

**Best Gift Shop: Glenfarclas**

Glenfarclas doesn't have the biggest gift shop; that honor goes to Macallan, naturally. It also doesn't have a ton of distillery-exclusive single casks, which is the province of Benriach and GlenAllachie. Nor does Glenfarclas have the slick styling of some modern big distilleries, particularly those Diageo giants like Talisker. So what makes it so great? It keeps the focus on people who love their whisky and rewards fans who make the pilgrimage. Several displays highlight the distillery's history, including the oldest known bottle of their whisky, dating back to the 19th century. Meanwhile, you can purchase a range of whiskies that, while not quite distillery exclusives, you cannot find many other places‚Äìor at least not all in one place. Someone with deep pockets may gravitate toward the Family Casks and can buy whisky dating from every decade from the 1950s to the 2010s. Meanwhile, someone like me can find some fascinating one-off bottles in what I've taken to calling the Cabinet of Curiosities. I've described this feature in [an earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scotch/comments/1kdbuy8/scotland_2025_trip_reports_spirit_of_speyside_day/) but, essentially, Glenfarclas offers bottles that they have held back for quality-control purposes for several years. Some of these single-cask or limited edition bottles were 25 or 30 years old, and were priced similarly to the standard Glenfarclas 25. I picked up two single casks, both 15 years old, for 80 and 85 pounds, which is an unbelievable value in today's market.

**Best Bar (Edinburgh): Tipsy Midgie‚Äôs**

You pour me Ardbeg Airigh Nam Beist for 4 pounds, and you've pretty much got this award wrapped up. As mentioned in my earlier post, Colin at Tipsy Midgie‚Äôs runs incredible specials throughout the week, particularly on Sundays and Mondays. On Memories Monday, Tipsy Midgie‚Äôs pours whiskies from the 80s, 90s, and 2000s for an incredibly affordable 4 pounds per pour, and includes some heavy hitters like Tomatin 21-year or the legendary Ardbeg Airigh Nam Beist among the unbelievable lineup. You could spend a whole trip to Scotland just here and try rarer and more interesting scotches than you've ever seen before.

**Best Bar (Speyside): The Highlander Inn**

Minagawa-san does it right here, creating a pub-like atmosphere that feels welcoming and cozy but also happens to have one of the deepest selections of whisky in Speyside for more than fair prices. It lacks the impress-your-boss luxury of The Spirit Safe in Rothes but, if all you want is to dig into some first-rate whiskies (including the Inn‚Äôs own single casks), Highlander Inn is the way to go.

**Most Generous Distillery: Craigellachie & The Glenrothes (tie)**

Two events stood out as unusually generous during festival week. I‚Äôve already mentioned Craigellachie‚Äôs over-the-top aperitivo hour above, and the second one was The Glenrothes‚Äôs Spirit of Speyside debut tasting. For 60 pounds, I was hoping that we‚Äôd get to try a good chunk of the distillery‚Äôs standard lineup up to the 25-year-old expression, and maybe a dram that was even older or more unusual. I seriously underestimated what was coming. Kat poured us a lineup that started with the 18- and 25-year-old, and then carried on to significantly older and rarer expressions: Glenrothes 32-year-old, 42-year-old, and a 44-year-old estate single cask. This was my first event of the festival and left me absolutely gobsmacked.

**Best Speyside Restaurant: Qismat Indian**

I'm a sucker for a killer lunch deal, and this chic Indian restaurant in Elgin more than delivers. 15 pounds for a three-course of an appetizer, curry entree, and a coffee, tea, or ice cream? Sign me up every day of the week, especially when the food is so flavorful and filling. Pro tip: if you can‚Äôt grab street parking on High Street, which can get crowded, there is very affordable public parking immediately north of High Street in front of the Marks & Spencer food.

**Largest Visitors Center: The Macallan**

Notice I didn‚Äôt say *best* visitors center. This is the award for biggest visitors center‚Äìa prize that, of course, an American like me would want to give out. Say what you will about The Macallan, but they do insist on standing out. This place looks like something that Darth Vader would design if he joined the Sierra Club. The interior has a very dark, ultra-modern aesthetic, with massive dark gray steel beams holding up a gently undulating ceiling composed of Swedish pine. The distillery itself, including an astounding 36 stills (12 wash and 24 spirit), is housed on-site, so a tour can happen entirely within this vast, museum-like space, concluding with tasting whisky at the second-floor bar (which has a private tasting cave built into and housed slightly under the circular bar). This place is really something to behold, even if an eye or two might roll while you‚Äôre there.

**Best Artwork: Wandering Shadows at the Scottish National Gallery**

One more plug for the National Gallery, which is free to visit (there is a suggested optional 5-pound donation, which is more than reasonable). I loved this piece by Peter Graham, which captured the rugged, bucolic beauty of the highlands and also showcases some exceptional technique in the contrast of light and shadow. Looking at it, I could almost feel the temperamental and ever-shifting elements that one would encounter during a long walk through Glencoe or the Cairngorms.

**Best Souvenir: Fossils from Collectors‚Äô Cabin in Dufftown**

The conventional choice (and one that almost anyone would appreciate, to be fair) is Scottish cashmere from Johnstons of Elgin or House of Brora. And those items, like scarves, hats, gloves, or sweaters, are beautiful items. But while I did visit those locales and did come back with a beautiful tartan scarf for my wife, I also happened upon a charming shop in Dufftown that made a bigger impression on me. Collector‚Äôs Cabin sells a dazzling variety of collectibles, ranging from minerals to ancient coins and antiquities to fossils. The owner and I struck up a conversation, and he has a wonderful life. After retiring 20-odd years ago, he opened these shops to enjoy his boyhood hobby of collecting these types of items. Now, he gets to enjoy his unusual finds‚ÄìI saw a pair of mososaur jaws, among other stunning fossils like trilobites and ammonites‚Äìuntil someone comes along and takes them off his hands. A true gentleman and enthusiast, and a store well worth a drop-in if you‚Äôre in Dufftown to visit Balvenie, Glenfiddich, or the great local whisky spots like Whisky Brother and the Whisky Capital Inn.

At the risk of stating the obvious, Spirit of Speyside is one of the most spectacular whisky festivals I‚Äôve attended, and perhaps the finest in Scotland. I hope to return in future years and explore even more of this lovely country. And I hope to see some (or many) of you there next time!

Among the most luxurious coffees in the world, Kopi Luwak and Black Ivory stand out, not just for their rarity and price, but for the unusual paths they take from farm to cup. Both chemically alter green coffee beans, resulting in smoother, more refined brews. Kefircoffee‚Ñ¢ joins their ranks, offering a similarly elevated profile through a 100% natural microbial process.  
  
üç¨Kopi Luwak (up to ‚Ç¨550/kg) is processed through the digestive tract of civet cats.  
  
üç¨Black Ivory (up to ‚Ç¨1,800/kg) is produced when elephants eat and digest the cherries.  
  
üç¨Kefircoffee‚Ñ¢ mirrors the flavour refinement of these coffees using 100% natural microbial process.  
  
All three methods are linked by a shared mechanism: biochemical transformation of green coffee beans post harvest.  
  
ü´ò Inside the Green Bean: Post-Harvest Complexities  
  
After coffee cherries are harvested and pulped, green coffee beans still contain:  
  
Residual sugars: fructose, glucose, sucrose from the surrounding fruit  
  
Organic acids: chlorogenic and quinic acids  
  
Complex carbohydrates: polysaccharides like arabinogalactans and mannans  
  
Proteins and peptides: potential flavour precursors  
  
ü´òKopi Luwak: Civet Digestion  
Enzymes in the civet‚Äôs stomach and intestines partially break down proteins and reduce sugars.  
  
Result: reduced bitterness, mild acidity, and smoother mouthfeel.  
  
ü´òBlack Ivory: Elephant Digestion  
Cellulases and proteases in the elephant gut degrade plant fibres, proteins, and bitter acids.  
  
Extended digestion creates a deep, mellow flavour with floral and chocolatey notes.  
  
ü´òKefircoffee‚Ñ¢: 100% Natural Microbial Process  
Green coffee beans are processed using a cultured mix of yeasts and lactic acid.  
  
These microbes metabolise leftover sugars, break down harsh acids, and hydrolyse complex carbohydrates.  
  
Result: Silky texture, refined acidity, and complex, layered aroma.  
  
üî¨ These processes reshape the chemical landscape of the bean before roasting. This matters because roasting primarily amplifies the existing chemical profile of the green bean, roasting merely accentuates what's already there.

Hey, I‚Äôm Mia! I‚Äôm ‚ÄúGold Verified.‚Äù I‚Äôm offering a girlfriend experience that‚Äôs centered around authentic connection, not just a transactional dynamic. I‚Äôm someone who truly values real chemistry and meaningful conversations that feel natural and fulfilling. This isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúgoing through the motions‚Äù for me. Im not looking to play a role, I wont put on a show and not interested in playing pretend. I love to laugh, and I want someone I can really laugh with, I‚Äôm talking about that real - genuine - stomach hurts - spit your coffee out - type of laughter üòÜ . A girlfriend experience with me looks like those kinds of laughs, often. It looks like having someone you can talk to, confide in, and share honest, genuine experiences with.

Let‚Äôs be real, ‚Äúspicy‚Äù content can be bought anywhere and most of it is free to look at anyway lol. I don‚Äôt want someone who prioritizes that over meaningful connection. connection is the real luxury, here. I‚Äôd like to do this with someone who understands that, and someone who wants to connect with me emotionally and intimately. Yes, we‚Äôll have an ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù - but I‚Äôm looking for something that feels less like a transaction and more like a real connection. The kind where we both feel seen, supported, and appreciated.

Outside of this, my life is really fulfilling. Im career oriented, but in my spare time I‚Äôm probably enjoying an Italian dinner w/ family, on a hike w/ my pups, hitting the beach in the summer, binge watching a show, or curled up on the couch (in oversized sweats) reading a book or writing my novel. I thrive on good energy & spontaneous adventures. If you like a woman who‚Äôs full of life, a little bold, and always ready to lift you up, hey..we might just click. Im a social butterfly, but I also get along with people who are more introverted. It would be cool to do this with someone who matches my energy, but sometimes the best connections are the ones where opposites balance each other out. 

Overall..I‚Äôm down to earth, low drama, and I like to think I bring something different to the table. I pride myself on being real and one of a kind. If you‚Äôve actually read this far, chances are you‚Äôre exactly the kind of person I‚Äôd love to hear from.

Mother's day has me reflecting on parenthood. We have two tiny kiddos: my son is 3.5 years, and my daughter is 9 months. My husband and I are in the thick of it, and I am worn out - between working full time and parenting two low sleep needs kids, the only time we have for ourselves/each other is during nap time on the weekends (my toddler doesn't fall asleep until 9/9:15 and one of the kids is up by 5:30 every day, and our baby is still waking quite a bit at night, which I feel is developmentally normal.)

Wayback 2022, nagawan ko ng kasalanan si C na taga dito sa amin wherein na-damay na pati ang both family namin sa issue. Ako talaga may kasalanan, kasi ako yung hindi nagisip.

I baked it and let it sit an hour this morning before bringing it over slightly warm to her house. To my relief it turned out amazing! Better inside than most of my bread had been. Especially the bottom which recently hasn‚Äôt been cooked as well in my last couple of loafs. 

She made her own raspberry jam too so our coffee break was delicious :)

I‚Äôm just so happy it worked because man was I stressed about not being able to cut into it and see before giving it to someone.

Recipe:
100g starter
300g water
500g flour

- 5:45pm mix shaggy dough
- 6:50pm 11g salt and 1st stretch and fold
- 7:30pm, 8pm, 8:30pm stretch and folds
- Let sit until 2am then shaped and put in fridge (I was up late doing something else)
- Took out of fridge at 9am and let sit for an hour before baking

How do I address this with them both moving forwards?,"My husband sent pictures of my feet to his cousin without me knowing and thinks it‚Äôs NBD.

Unwinding on the sofa after work, my husband is on his phone. I ask him is he‚Äôll rub my feet because I‚Äôm a teacher and spend most of my day standing. 

He doesn‚Äôt want to because he thinks feet are gross (and has always disliked giving me massages) but says half-jokingly ‚Äòyou should ask Tim, he has a thing for feet and thinks yours are great.‚Äô 

Tim is my husbands 16yo cousin, very quiet, only exchanged some pleasant words at big family gatherings but I understand my husband is protective of him as he‚Äôs been bullied in school, and Tim looks up to my husband.

Because of this my reaction is surprise and being vaguely grossed out. I ask him how Tim has ever had an opportunity to see my feet and my husband says, very casually, that he‚Äôs sent Tim a couple of pictures. To his credit he showed me the convo straight away. A couple of days prior he was texting Tim encouraging him to talk to girls and asking what he looks for in a girlfriend - like ‚Äòass guy or tits guy?‚Äô Which is obviously gross enough but I have brothers and chalked it up to guy talk. 

Tim asks if he can keep a secret and says it‚Äôs weird but he has a thing for feet, and my husband jokes around with him for a while until Tim asks if I have nice feet. At this point my husband sent him a picture of my sitting on the sofa watching tv with my feet up on the coffee table in black tights. I never knew he took this picture. My husband asked ‚Äòwhat do you think?‚Äô and Tim said ‚Äòseem OK but can‚Äôt tell in tights‚Äô. 

The next day my husband sent Tim 3 more pictures. They were all of my soles while I was kneeling on the floor sorting laundry (in pajama shorts no less). He asks ‚Äòwhat do you think now?‚Äô And Tim says ‚Äòur a lucky guy lol, thanks.‚Äô

Now I‚Äôve flipped out on my husband because to me this is a multi-level invasion of privacy and disrespect. First, to even take pictures of me without knowing, and secondly to send to his (16 year old!) cousin in an obviously inappropriate context. 

His response was ‚Äòwould I need permission to send holiday photos of us to others? Because in some of those you‚Äôre wearing sandals. In some of them your ears are visible, what if the person I‚Äôm sending them too likes ears? Feet are obviously gross and non-sexual, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with me sending a picture of them to him, if he gets his kicks to it it‚Äôs on him, but it‚Äôs not like I sent a picture of you nude, or in lingerie, or a bikini.‚Äô 

At one point I wondered if I was being unreasonable but I feel extremely gross that this greasy teenager who I don‚Äôt even particularly like is asking for, and looking at, pictures of my feet, and I‚Äôm still furious with my husband for it. I‚Äôm due to see the cousin for an extended-family BBQ at the end of the month and I‚Äôm mortified. Do I confront him? What about his parents? And how am I supposed to draw these boundaries with my husband moving forwards? ",3,1747057586.0,Advice,15,0.8,False

1kksttv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kksttv/hm_terminal_velocity/,[HM] Terminal Velocity,"	The scowl his daughter gave him at the fountain pop machine was entirely unwarranted, but he obliged anyway. It was not out of some profound guilt that he relented and opted to forego a plastic straw, but rather to avoid the headache that would ensue after listening to another one of her preachy sermons. If he had known three weeks ago that watching a documentary about the countless tons of garbage waste annually dumped in the Atlantic Ocean, a miniscule and yet still grossly overexaggerated percentage of which was plastic straws, and the impact it had on the sea turtle population, he would have just stayed late at work. She smiled, reached her into her purse, and handed him a reusable metal straw. 
	He had ordered a double cheeseburger topped with an ungodly amount of bacon, and she had ordered some imitation vegan burger overrun by vegetation. He tore into his, ravenous after a long day of meetings where the only refreshments had been stale doughnuts and burnt coffee, while she nibbled away in apparent satisfaction. When he took a sip of his drink, a metallic sting filled his mouth that was not unlike the taste of blood. Grimacing, he stifled a fit, and took another bite.
	His daughter, Juliana, was 18-years-old, and worse, she had her mother‚Äôs movie star good looks. She paused twice during the meal to take selfies, each time prominently displaying the metal straw and the matching stainless-steel canteen that had come with it. Evidently, plastic cups were beneath her, too. Together, the ensemble had cost him nearly $50.00, evidenced by the credit card statement that arrived in the mail yesterday. He bit his tongue about it, though, knowing his wife would side with their daughter on the matter.
Juliana got her activist spirit from her mother, Vanessa, who when Donald first met her, had recently been acquitted of charges stemming from vandalizing an illegal fishing boat. The evidence against her had been underwhelming, and though she would have happily taken credit for the act, her lawyer had strongly advised against it. They were introduced through mutual friends at the university tavern, and Donald, who had been working his way through veterinary school and had a passion for animals himself, was enamoured by the act. He thought it was her free spirit and wild nature that attracted him to her, but her likeness to a young Audrey Hepburn may have also had something to do with it. 
Vanessa‚Äôs activism, or eco-terrorism, as she once dubbed it, while at times unhinged and excessive, was not without its charm. She organized many rallies on campus during his collegiate years, and it was not until well after they started dating that he discovered she had never even been enrolled at the school to begin with. She marched as much for the animals as she did to stay close to him, and though that level of pursuit may have scared other men away, Donald was flattered. He had never been a ladies‚Äô man, per se, and when he found a woman that looked like she did that had passions aimed in a least the same general direction as his, he was hooked.
	Their early life together was not comfortable, but she had spent enough night chained by the wrists to centenarian oak trees or fastened to pieces of heavy equipment in a vain effort to thwart deforestation that the dingy apartments he could afford seemed like a luxury to her. His academic career was long and drawn out, but Vanessa stood proudly by him, and by the time he graduated, he had a doctorate in veterinarian medicine and was a qualified and licensed animal radiologist. Almost overnight, their lives changed tremendously. He accepted a job in the city, and Vanessa quit her waitressing job and took up the time-consuming hobby of reading bridal magazines. Within a year, they were married, and a year after that, Juliana was born. Their new home was lavish and luxurious, though outshined by the extravagant garden Vanessa raised in the back yard.
	‚ÄúHashtag: save the turtles,‚Äù Juliana mumbled proudly to herself with a satisfied smirk, unblinkingly fixated on her phone. Donald rolled his eyes subtly enough so that she would not see him. That was her form of activism, or at least, her generation‚Äôs. It was not about sending a message anymore, as it had been when his wife was younger, but rather about broadcasting to the world that you knew the message. Keyboard activism, he had once heard it called. It was toothless, and while he had no desire for her to go vandalize some poacher‚Äôs boat, it still seemed a far stretch from the antics her mother used to get up to back when she still had long braided rows of hair and weathered rose-coloured glasses. 
	‚ÄúThere, it‚Äôs posted,‚Äù she said happily, slurping the last drops from her metal canteen. She looked up at him for the first time since they had sat down to eat. ‚ÄúCan we go now, daddy? I have to shower and change before I go meet up with Adam.‚Äù
	Adam, he thought to himself, gritting his teeth. He could not stand Adam. He was some hotshot 20-year-old fresh out of flight school who fancied himself to be the next Top Gun. ‚ÄúAnd what exactly are you and Adam planning on doing tonight?‚Äù he said, making no attempt to feign enthusiasm. 
	‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taking me on a sunset flight,‚Äù she said, her eyes sparkling, her cheeks reddening to a rosy glow.
	‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so, Jules,‚Äù he said, trying to force some of that paternal authority back into his voice that had somehow depleted over the years.
	‚ÄúDad,‚Äù Juliana started, smiling rather than being argumentative, ‚ÄúMum already said I could. And besides, I‚Äôm an adult now. I can make my own decisions.‚Äù
	This time, Donald did not attempt to hide his eye roll. ‚ÄúAdult?‚Äù he scoffed, knowing already he would not win the argument, ‚ÄúAdults have jobs.‚Äù
	‚ÄúI do have a job!‚Äù she giggled, her giddiness undermining his authority. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an influencer. I get paid every time I post online.‚Äù If he had not already paid for the meal, he might have handed her the bill.
	Defeated, he sighed, and said, ‚ÄúGo get in the truck.‚Äù

	Her makeup routine was elaborate, sponsored, and done entirely in front of a camera. She made sure to add the caption #SaveTheTurtles to her broadcast, and periodically took long sips from her metal canteen for all her viewers to see. All in all, the process took over half an hour, and another hour more to do her hair and pick out an outfit. By the time she finished, Donald was asleep in the living room chair while Vanessa was watching some cooking program on the television. He awoke to the sound of her scurrying down the stairs, and was still half groggy when she skipped over to kiss him on the cheek. ‚ÄúBye mum, bye dad,‚Äù she said, dashing for the door.
	‚ÄúI want you home by 10:30,‚Äù Donald declared, finding that dormant paternal voice within him. 
Juliana turned, smiled, and said, ‚ÄúNo problem. Love you. Bye.‚Äù And then she was off.
The airport was a 20-minute drive away, and Adam was waiting for her near the entrance to a little hangar on the far end. He greeted her with a smile and a kiss on the cheek. While they were yet to put an official label on the relationship, they were both very smitten. He was a handsome boy, slight but muscled, with a mop of thick brown hair that barely swayed in the wind. ‚ÄúYou ready?‚Äù he asked, and she smiled affirmatively.
He helped her aboard the little four-seater Cessna 172, and after performing a diligent walkaround, climbed aboard. He pulled his headset over his ears and instructed Juliana to do the same. It was her first time in a small plane, and though she felt nervous, it was that exhilarating sort of nervous. He fired up the engine, and as the propellor came to life, he pulled out a checklist and began making his through the items. ‚ÄúOil pressure, check,‚Äù he muttered, quickly referencing the gauge before returning to the checklist. ‚ÄúNav lights, on. Avionics master, on, radios, on.‚Äù He continued down the list, and when he was complete, he folded it up and tucked it in a pouch on the door. Using his best captain‚Äôs voice, he then said, ‚ÄúYoung lady, please keep your hands and feet inside the ride at all time. If you have any questions, your captain will be happy to assist you.‚Äù He flashed her a wink, and she blushed some more.
On the radio, he contacted ground control, and after receiving his clearance, began taxiing towards the active runway. The jolt of the plane moving forward made her jump, and she felt the thrill of anticipation surge through her. She looked over at his face, which was contoured by the fading sun off to his side, and thought the butterflies in her stomach were as capable of flight as the plane was.
The takeoff was as smooth as butter, and as the plane climbed, she felt a sense of freedom like she never had before. ‚ÄúHow are you doing?‚Äù he asked, his voice blaring through the headset. She answered only with a wide-toothed grin and a thumbs up, and this time, it was Adam‚Äôs turn to blush. He told her his plan was to fly her over the city, and that on the way back he would take her over her parents‚Äô house. If he had told her his plan was to fly circles over the runway for two hours, she would have been just as happy, but the idea of seeing her city and her home from above was thrilling. 
The climb was slow compared to the airliners she had flown on before, but she was in no rush to get anywhere. He kept her constantly informed, occasionally saying something like ‚Äú6500 feet now, and climbing,‚Äù before transmitting position reports over the radio. She had no reference to base it on, but she could not help but think how incredibly professional he was. ‚ÄúClimbing through 8000 feet,‚Äù he said a little while later. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll level off here. Want to take some pictures?‚Äù
She had been so enraptured by the entire experience that she had almost forgotten about her phone. She started with a series of selfies of the two of them, then turned her sights onto the scenery, snapping pictures of every landmark he pointed out. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the high school,‚Äù he said, pointing. She could not believe how different it looked from the sky. She snapped photos liberally. ‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs the mall. And there‚Äôs the zoo.‚Äù
As the sun began to set, he began flying circles over the city. A few breathtaking photos later, she asked if she could open a window to feel the air. Her question was partly in jest, but Adam told her it would be no problem. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs little sliding windows designed just for that,‚Äù he said, reaching over her. Before he slid the window open, he warned, ‚ÄúJust so you know, it‚Äôs about to get really loud and really windy. She smiled and said that was fine. As he slid open the pane, a torrent of air rushed in, and her meticulously styled hair became a palm tree in a hurricane. She began laughing and smiling harder than she ever had before. Beside her, Adam was laughing too. 
Not wanting to miss the opportunity for a funny photo, she held her phone out in front of her, then raised her metal canteen in the other hand. Her hair was billowing wildly in every direction, blocking her vision in spurts and waves of shiny brunette locks. As she began trying to think of a funny caption to add to the photo later, they hit a small pocket of turbulence and the plane jolted violently from side to side. It lasted only a second, but it was enough to make her freeze up. Instinctively, she gave a little scream, but Adam only laughed, his hands firmly on the controls. ‚ÄúYou alright?‚Äù he asked, still laughing. The seat belt had dug slightly into her sides, but the pain subsided quickly. Her hair was still being thrown wildly around, but she forced out a soft ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù The jolt had shocked her, and for a moment, her body had tensed up. 
When her heart slowed down again, at least to the elevated rhythm it had been since take off, her clarity began to return. She sensed that something was amiss, but the spike of adrenaline and the onslaught of swirling air kept her mind from thinking clearly. Between the waves of her swishing hair, she caught glimpses of the sunset. That looks normal, she thought. She saw her phone, still held up in her left hand. That‚Äôs normal too. She looked to her right, near the window, where her empty right hand was still held up. My mug! she thought with sudden horror. I dropped it out the window! She did not feel upset about losing it ‚Äîafter all, her father could buy her a new one‚Äî but rather she felt embarrassed for being so clumsy.
In one motion, she pulled her phone down to her lap while swiping the window pane closed with her free hand. Immediately, the loud rush of air ceased, and though there was still the sound of the propellor to contend with, everything seemed much more quiet and still. ‚ÄúHad enough, eh?‚Äù Adam laughed, his eyes fixed on the horizon. She was mortified, humiliated, but at least he had not seemed to notice. 
‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs enough for now,‚Äù she said, forcing a giggle as she smoothed her hair back in place. She stole a glance out the window, down on the city and 8000 feet of altitude that separated them from the ground. She hoped desperately that her canteen would land somewhere far off the beaten path, harmlessly in a clump of trees where it would never be found again.
When his phone rang, it was just after 9 o‚Äôclock. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù Vanessa asked from the couch beside him. Donald fumbled for his reading glasses, and after putting them on, read the called ID. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs work,‚Äù he said in an oddly confused tone. ‚ÄúThey never call this late. Something must be up.‚Äù He strolled out of the room as he answered, and five minutes later, when he returned to the living room, he was wearing his coat. ‚ÄúMedical emergency,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be a few hours by the sounds of it.‚Äù
His wife wished him well, and told him to call when he had a better idea how long he would be. He told her to keep an eye out for Juliana, and reminded her of the strict 10:30 curfew. ‚ÄúI want to know if she‚Äôs even a minute late,‚Äù he said as he tied his boots. 
‚ÄúYou need to cut the girl some slack,‚Äù Vanessa teased him. They kissed, and then he was gone. When he got into his truck, the strange phone call began playing in his head again. Whenever possible, he spared his wife of the less savoury details of his work, and this call was no exception. He was to report to the medical bay at the zoo, where he was needed to perform a necropsy, the term for an animal autopsy, on a camel that had been found dead under mysterious circumstances. It had only just been discovered, but he had been assured that by the time he arrived, the animal would be laid out on a sterile table and whatever tools he required would be ready for him.
The zoo had been closed for over two hours by the time he arrived, but the parking lot was still nearly than half full. There were several police cars, each parked with their emergency lights rotating, as well as a collection of hastily parked vehicles he could only assume belonged to employees called in for the occurrence. When he reached the front doors, a young lady was waiting for him. ‚ÄúDr. Morrisson?‚Äù she asked in a wavering voice. He nodded. ‚ÄúRight this way, sir.‚Äù
She led him down a narrow flight of spiral stairs to a dimly lit hallway. As they walked, they passed several scantly decorated offices, each housing frantic employees tethered to telephones and speaking in hushed, quickened tones. Some of them looked terrified, others looked devastated. One woman sat hunched over her desk with tears streaming down her face. At the end of the hall, a set of double doors opened to reveal a surgical bay. There were a dozen people wearing masks and gowns forming a circle around the table that held the enormous Bactrian camel carcass.
‚ÄúMy God,‚Äù was all he could say when he saw it. The animal‚Äôs skull was entirely caved in, leaving only a faint impression of what the great beast had once looked like. The tan fur that lined its double-humped back was matted in dried blood. ‚ÄúWhat do we know?‚Äù he asked to the crowd as he donned his own gown and gloves. 
It was not one of the veterinarians who answered him, but rather a police officer who was up close to the creature snapping photos. ‚ÄúCause of death appears to be the blow to the head. Cranial fracture, skull completely imploded. Size of the wound seems consistent with a sledge hammer.  There‚Äôs another, much smaller puncture on its back between the humps, size of that one seems consistent with a gunshot wound.‚Äù
‚ÄúA gunshot wound,‚Äù Donald echoed flatly. ‚ÄúSo, your working theory is that somebody broke into the camel pen, bludgeoned the creature in the head with a sledge hammer, then immediately shot the thing in the back and left?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe investigation is ongoing,‚Äù the officer said defensively. ‚ÄúYou got any better ideas?‚Äù
Donald took another look at the animal. ‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù he confessed, ‚ÄúBut I think a small meteorite more likely than a mob style execution.‚Äù
‚ÄúA meteorite,‚Äù the officer repeated, imitating the mild sarcasm Donald had carried in his voice. ‚ÄúDo you think that‚Äôs actually possible?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Donald said. ‚ÄúI find it easier to believe that than someone with a vendetta against a camel. Have you searched the area?‚Äù
‚ÄúSearched it for what?‚Äù the officer asked.
‚ÄúAnything that doesn‚Äôt belong,‚Äù Donald said, and before the officer could answer, he asked one of the vet techs for a scalpel. He studied the fractured skull for a moment, and after determining there was not much he could learn from it, moved on to the injury on the midback. As he began to cut away the hide, the officer slinked out of the room, no doubt headed back to the scene of the crime.
Twenty minutes later, he returned holding an evidence bag with a bloody and deformed chunk of steel inside, looing equal parts confused and satisfied. Donald had just concluded the autopsy, and on the table, the camel‚Äôs back had been dissected and left open, revealing a severed spinal cord. 
‚ÄúCan I see that?‚Äù Donald asked, plucking the evidence bag from the officer‚Äôs hand before he had a chance to reply. Hastily, he pulled out the chunk of steel, and using a wet rag, wiped the dirt, blood, and brain matter from it. The officer‚Äôs eyes widened.
‚ÄúThere could have been fingerprints on that, you idiot!‚Äù he yelled. The others in the room turned to face Donald.
‚ÄúFingerprints?‚Äù he echoed dumbly, then turned and set the object inside the camel‚Äôs skull cavity. It was a perfect fit. ‚ÄúJust as I suspected,‚Äù he said, ignoring the officer‚Äôs anger. The contorted piece of steel was what remained of a flattened metal canteen. ‚ÄúWe safely can rule out murder by sledge hammer and death by meteorite impact,‚Äù he continued, grabbing a pair of forceps and plunging them back into the opening between the animal‚Äôs humps. ‚ÄúAnything with a considerable mass dropped from a high enough altitude can cause significant damage once it reaches terminal velocity. My guess is that this canteen was accidently jettisoned from an aircraft flying over the zoo. It was the canteen that caused its death, but,‚Äù he paused, lifting the forceps up, revealing a long metal tube between the plier‚Äô teeth, ‚ÄúIt was the straw that broke that camel‚Äôs back.‚Äù

Owosso, which is about a 90-minute drive northwest of the Detroit¬†Metro Airport (DTW),¬†should be at the top of your list. Not only does it check off the waterfront box, but it also offers beautiful natural landscapes beyond its river, as well as locations for both learning about the past and ones for finding unique goods from the past.



With nearly half the population density as Detroit, you can rest easy knowing that Owosso will be a nice place to, well, rest. But that doesn't mean you'll be bored or without things to do. The downtown area sits along the Shiawassee River, providing lovely views as you experience the city's vibrant visual and performing arts culture, local shops for finding both antiques and newer pieces, and community events. The city's features also include walking trails through various terrains and unique museums, including the enchanting Owosso Curwood Castle.

Michigan's most underrated museum may be Fayette Historic Townsite, with its iconic lake views, but Owosso's Curwood Castle is also very high on that list. What makes this landmark so special is that it was built by best-selling¬†action-adventure author James Oliver Curwood, who wrote more than two dozen novels.¬†Not only were readers able to experience his works, though, as many of his books were also¬†adapted into films.¬†He replicated the architecture of a Norman chateau for his yellow stucco Curwood Castle, which he built as a writing studio and to entertain guests. After his death, it became a year-round museum for fans to explore.



For vehicle enthusiasts, the DeVries Historic Carriage and Sleigh Museum is where you'll want to be. The center holds a collection of more than 25 old vehicles ‚Äî from carriages and buggies to sleighs and surreys ‚Äî in varying degrees of restoration. The museum is named after Dr. Jack DeVries, to whom the collection once belonged. This institute sits within the larger grounds of the DeVries Nature Conservancy, which is free for all visitors and features almost five miles of serene trails to explore. Be one with the natural world as you walk through all kinds of landscapes, including forests, grasslands, and¬†river floodplains. Make sure to keep your eyes peeled throughout your hike, as these trails are ideal for birdwatching.



Continue your day of fun learning with a visit to the Shiawassee Arts Center, where a packed calendar of exhibits awaits. The center also offers art classes for all ages, a unique artisanal gift shop, and galleries. Switch over from visual arts to performance works with a trip to the Owosso Performing Arts Center, where you can catch a professional show.

Wandering through a charming castle, taking in the history and beautiful landscape of The DeVries Historic Carriage and Sleigh Museum, and enjoying an exhibit at the arts center will burn through a lot of your energy. Refuel with the dining scene in downtown Owosso, so you're ready to either continue with your exploration of the riverfront city the next day or travel to check out Portland ‚Äî another¬†scenic Michigan city with its two rivers.



For a caffeinated pick-me-up, head to an outpost of the regional chain Biggby Coffee. The company now has stores in more than 10 states across the United States, but it all started with its first store just 30 miles southwest of Owosso in East Lansing, Michigan, in 1995. As Michigan borders Canada, you'll also be able to grab a cup of joe from Canadian chain Tim Hortons, which has a shop right by the river off of Main Street. When it comes to food, there's a good mix of fast food chains like McDonald's, Wendy's, and Domino's alongside local haunts like Rainbow Bar, Barrister Brewing Company, and Wrought Iron Grill. After getting some grub, it's time for the best course: Dessert. Grab a delicious scoop of ice cream from Prescott's Cone Zone, which offers different Dole Whip flavors each week.



With your stomach now full, it's time to get your shopping on! Bring home a special keepsake from one of Owosso's unique shops. Search through the antique store, New & Old Unique Treasures, to see what hidden gems catch your eye. If a deep dive sounds like too much, head over to Aviator Jayne, a home goods store, where you'll find a more curated selection of new and vintage finds.

Here's how to adjust your habits for the better:,"A Practical Guide to Car Efficiency

Want to save money at the pump and reduce your environmental footprint? Improving your car's efficiency is the answer. However, achieving optimal fuel economy isn't as simple as just buying a fuel-efficient vehicle. It requires a multifaceted approach involving driving habits, vehicle maintenance, and smart planning. Before diving into the how-to, it's crucial to acknowledge some key challenges:

*   **The ""Lead Foot"" Factor:** Aggressive driving (rapid acceleration, hard braking) drastically reduces fuel efficiency, often negating any gains from other efforts.
*   **Maintenance Neglect:** Ignoring routine maintenance like tire pressure checks and air filter replacements can lead to significant fuel waste over time.
*   **Misinformation and Gimmicks:** The market is flooded with products and ""tips"" that promise miraculous fuel savings, many of which are ineffective or even harmful.

Understanding these challenges is the first step toward effectively maximizing your car's efficiency. Now, let's explore practical strategies.

*   **Smooth Acceleration and Braking:** Avoid rapid acceleration and hard braking. Gradually increase your speed and anticipate traffic stops to coast whenever possible. Imagine you have an open cup of coffee on your dashboard ‚Äì drive smoothly enough to avoid spilling it.
*   **Maintain a Consistent Speed:** Cruise control on highways can significantly improve fuel efficiency by maintaining a steady speed. Fluctuations in speed require more energy. However, be aware of changing traffic conditions and adapt accordingly.
*   **Avoid Idling:** Idling consumes fuel without covering any distance. If you're stopped for more than 30 seconds, turn off your engine. Modern cars are designed to restart quickly and efficiently, making this a simple way to conserve fuel.
*   **Minimize Short Trips:** Cold engines are less efficient. Combine errands into a single trip to allow your engine to reach its optimal operating temperature.
*   **Be Mindful of Speed Limits:** Observe speed limits. Fuel efficiency typically decreases rapidly at speeds above 50 mph.

### Vehicle Maintenance: Keeping Your Car Running Efficiently

Regular maintenance ensures your car operates at peak performance, which translates to better fuel economy:

*   **Check Tire Pressure Regularly:** Underinflated tires increase rolling resistance, forcing your engine to work harder and consume more fuel. Check your tire pressure at least once a month and inflate them to the manufacturer's recommended pressure (found on a sticker inside your driver's side door or in your owner's manual).
*   **Replace Air Filters:** A clogged air filter restricts airflow to the engine, reducing power and fuel efficiency. Replace your air filter according to the manufacturer's recommended schedule.
*   **Use the Correct Engine Oil:** Using the recommended grade of engine oil reduces friction and improves fuel economy. Consult your owner's manual for the correct oil type for your vehicle.
*   **Keep Your Engine Tuned:** Regular engine tune-ups (spark plug replacement, etc.) ensure your engine is running optimally. Follow the manufacturer's recommended maintenance schedule.
*   **Check and Replace Fluids:** Routine check ups to maintain proper fluid levels for all essential fluids, such as coolant, power steering, and brake fluid, help improve overall engine efficiency and component longevity.

### Smart Planning: Optimizing Your Journeys

Strategic planning can also contribute to fuel savings:

*   **Plan Your Route:** Use navigation apps to find the most efficient route, avoiding traffic congestion and unnecessary detours.
*   **Lighten Your Load:** Remove unnecessary items from your car. Excess weight increases fuel consumption.
*   **Consider Carpooling or Public Transportation:** Whenever possible, share rides or use public transportation to reduce the number of vehicles on the road.
*   **Use Air Conditioning Judiciously:** Air conditioning can significantly reduce fuel economy. Use it sparingly, especially at lower speeds. Consider opening windows or using the ventilation system instead.
*   **Drive at Off-Peak Hours:** Avoiding rush hour can save considerable fuel. With less stop and go traffic and more opportunities to cruise at consistent speeds, your MPG will significantly increase.",1,1747056829.0,fwdtrek,0,1.0,False

I have 2 kids, ages 5 and 2. I told my husband weeks ago that I want him to help the boys prepare breakfast to bring it to me in bed. I reminded him weekly about breakfast. He was looking up omelette recipes on Saturday so I sent him a recipe for shakshuka and told him to make that instead. I had forgotten that this recipe calls for fresh tomatoes (I make it a few times per year and always use canned tomatoes).

Sunday morning, after he took the kids downstairs, I quickly went to the bathroom to brush my teeth so I was ready for breakfast. I waited for a bit then heard 5 year old coming upstairs and thought this is it. He came upstairs alone to give me his teddy and wish me happy Mother‚Äôs Day. I asked where daddy was and he said daddy is downstairs. I asked where the breakfast was and he said he asked daddy to make breakfast with him but daddy said they couldn‚Äôt make it?

Confused, I went downstairs and husband told me he couldn‚Äôt make the recipe I sent because we didn‚Äôt have enough fresh tomatoes in the fridge. I said ok but you could have made toast and coffee and he just shrugged his shoulders and said ‚Äúyeah I could have‚Äù. He then made coffee for both of us.

Then he went to his grandma‚Äôs with the 2 year old and I took 5 year old shopping for socks/underwear etc. We did some groceries and arrived home around 11:30. Husband got back home just after us. I asked what was for lunch and he was confused because he thought we would eat leftovers so we ate leftovers then took kids to the library. 

We got home around 3pm and I was thinking maybe he had plans for dinner. I said I was tired and wanted to sit for 10 mins. He said he was also tired and sat down and closed his eyes for a quick nap. Then at 3:30 I asked what everyone wanted for supper and my 5 year old started listing off his favourite foods but nothing from husband. Then I got frustrated and got up and went to the kitchen to prepare supper. He came over asking if I needed any help and I told him no, I didn‚Äôt need his help preparing my own Mother‚Äôs Day dinner. He said he wanted to make breakfast but we didn‚Äôt have enough tomatoes. I told him I‚Äôve already heard this excuse. Then I listed off a bunch of things he could have done instead:
- made a simple toast with coffee
- grabbed something for lunch
- grabbed a pastry/cake for dessert 
- made something for supper
- taken the kids out by himself for a couple of hours to give me some time off

I told him he didn‚Äôt even make simple coffee until I asked him and he‚Äôs setting a bad example for our kids. He got mad and stormed outside to cool off while I ended up making dinner and dessert and washing dishes.

So, I want to return the favor for anyone coming here for information or reassurance. Please note, this is based on my experience with the Canadian healthcare system.**

# Background

Former baseball player ‚Äî I was a regular pitcher. I walked away from the game in 2019 after a string of injuries and a steadily declining quality of life. I saw multiple sports doctors who recommended physio and other forms of therapy. Several imaging sessions revealed various issues, but surgery was never recommended.

Fast forward to 2024: I still couldn‚Äôt sleep comfortably. I‚Äôd wake up with arm pain, numbness, or tingling. My back was completely shot. On bad days, I could barely lift a mug of coffee. I decided to take matters into my own hands. I found two surgeons I wanted to work with and insisted my family doctor send consult requests.

The first orthopedic surgeon had the worst bedside manner and was completely unhelpful in offering a prognosis or outcome possibilities. Verbatim, I was told: *‚ÄúWith any type of surgery, the outcome is 50/50.‚Äù*

Frustrated, I went to the second surgeon ‚Äî a specialist in baseball/overhead sports injuries. He was well-renowned, honest, and great to work with. Having already had knee surgery, I appreciated that he didn‚Äôt sugarcoat anything. He warned me the shoulder recovery would be 10x worse and definitely not a short-term fix.

# Injuries/Damages (Right Shoulder)

* Labrum damage
* Significant partial tear in the supraspinatus (multiple locations)
* Impingement; loss of ROM (internal and external)
* Bicep tear and damage

# Surgery Performed

* SLAP Lesion Repair
* Rotator Cuff Repair
* Subacromial Decompression
* Bicep Tenodesis

# The Goal

My goal has always been to return to overhead sports recreationally and live an active lifestyle. Throughout this injury, I stayed active with regular workouts and low-intensity sports.

# Post-Op Protocol

My protocol was simple. At two weeks, I was told to come out of the sling during the day and continue sleeping with it until the end of week four. I started physio three times per week. By week six, I began loading all surgical areas with weight. I‚Äôve had my first follow-up with my surgeon, and he was impressed with my recovery.

# What‚Äôs Next?

The initial plan was to return to sports-related activities in August, but the new timeline is early June.  
I‚Äôm continuing to rehab once a week with physio, including shockwave therapy and acupuncture.

I‚Äôm now working out regularly again ‚Äî but I‚Äôll be honest: my brain and body are disconnected. My mind thinks I can lift way more than I actually can. Resisting ego lifting is 80% of the battle.

# Some of the Less Talked-About Issues

* **Edema:** Post-op, I had severe swelling in my elbow, causing immense pain, especially after the nerve blocker wore off.
* **Fear:** Every morning, I wake up worrying I‚Äôve reinjured my shoulder in my sleep ‚Äî even though that hasn‚Äôt happened.
* **Neck Stiffness:** I developed severe neck stiffness due to shoulder guarding. Apparently, this is normal ‚Äî it‚Äôs the body‚Äôs way of protecting the injured area.

# What Worked for Me

**Cryotherapy Ice Machine**  
I swear by this. I went through recovery without taking any painkillers, and this was my saving grace. During the first two weeks, I relied heavily on it. I‚Äôd use it for an hour, take it off for an hour, and repeat. Do yourself a favor and get one of these.

**Stretching & Protocol Tracking**  
Keep a tracker. It might feel like a chore, but it‚Äôs incredibly helpful. I tracked how I felt each morning, how often I stretched, and at what times. Now, I‚Äôm tracking my workouts, including weights, reps, and more.

**Get Used to Discomfort and Minor Pain**  
I already had poor sleep pre-surgery ‚Äî post-surgery, it was almost nonexistent. Even minor movements causing pain would wake me up. Don‚Äôt expect to be pain-free anytime soon. I‚Äôve spoken to others who still have pain 20 weeks out. Get comfortable being uncomfortable.

**Do Your Stretches Religiously**  
Be stubborn about it. Stick to your stretches and protocol unless you‚Äôre in severe pain. Push through the stiffness. Your body wants to guard the area, but you‚Äôve got to fight that instinct. Aim for at least three sessions a day.

**Invest in At-Home Recovery Equipment**  
I bought a roller, exercise balls, various resistance bands, wooden dowels, etc. Having these on hand helps keep the momentum going.

# Where I‚Äôm at (Week 10)

As I write this, I‚Äôve worked out two days in a row:

* 2.5 lb bicep curls
* 10 lb shoulder presses
* Rows, face pulls, etc.

I woke up pretty stiff this morning ‚Äî currently sitting with my cryo machine on.

**Final Thoughts**

I want to make it clear: I‚Äôm not a medical expert. This is just my personal experience ‚Äî what worked for me and brought me the most comfort. If anyone has questions, I‚Äôm happy to try and help based on what I‚Äôve been through.",4,1747056604.0,RotatorCuff,0,1.0,False

1kksibx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1kksibx/does_the_occiam_t19_wireless_earbuds_review/,Does the Occiam T19 wireless earbuds review deliver quality for workouts?,"The **occiam T19 Wireless Earbuds** caught my attention primarily because of their impressive claims‚Äî90-hour playback, sturdy over-ear hooks, and Bluetooth 5.3. When I started using these earbuds during my daily workout sessions and long calls, I immediately noticed how they combined practical features with fuss-free usability. Truth be told, I‚Äôve tried a fair share of wireless earbuds, but these packed a lot into a moderately compact package.

**A Design Tailored for Active Lifestyles**  
These earbuds feel like they were made for anyone constantly on the move. The over-ear hooks are really comfortable‚Äîno more worrying about them slipping out during my runs or my overly energetic gym routines. For once, I didn‚Äôt have to fiddle with adjusting them mid-podcast. Plus, the lightweight build (each weighing just a few grams) made it easy to wear them for hours. I even lent them to my cousin for his yoga session, and he loved how snug they felt. The black casing, while not groundbreaking, has a sleek and sporty vibe. The included charging case is compact enough to toss into any gym bag, making this product ultra-portable.

**HD Audio That Deserves a Nod**  
Audio quality often makes or breaks any earbuds, and these do pretty well. The 10mm dynamic drivers delivered clean, high-quality sound. Whether I was sweating it out to rock playlists or listening to audiobooks on weekend walks, I appreciated the crisp clarity. Bass heads might feel it‚Äôs a little balanced‚Äîno earth-shattering thumps‚Äîbut it definitely caters well to diverse audio genres. The dual HD microphones need a special mention too. My friend swears I sound clearer on calls now, even with some background chatter going on in coffee shops. Voice filtering? Check.

[Check occiam T19 price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0dx5tczbz/)  

**A Battery Life That Refuses to Quit**  
Now, this is where the occiam T19 shines unapologetically. A 90-hour total playback time feels unreal, but the claim holds up. With each earbud lasting around 8 hours on a single charge, I rarely found myself scrambling to juice it up. The charging case extends its playtime effortlessly while displaying the battery stats via a digital LED case. I had friends asking me about this feature because they got sick of charging their earbuds every couple of days. Oh, and the Type-C fast charging? Brilliant‚Äîit takes less than two hours to fill the case completely.

**Comfort Meets Sweat Resistance**  
Wearing these on a 5K race in rainy weather was no issue at all. They‚Äôre sweatproof and resist light rain thanks to their water-resistant design. Not only did they stay securely hooked over my ears, but I also didn‚Äôt have that gross slippage feeling. Offering different ear tip sizes (thank goodness!), they fit both my gigantic ears and my sister‚Äôs small ones like a glove. Whether you‚Äôre trail running or just lying on the beach soaking up playlists, these earbuds accommodate.

**Stable Connection, Hassle-Free Pairing**  
I rarely experienced drops in connectivity; the Bluetooth 5.3 technology ensures stable performance within a 30-foot range. Pairing them the first time was ridiculously simple‚ÄîI just opened the charging case, and they autoconnected like magic. Switching between mono and stereo modes was seamless, especially when I wanted to keep one ear free while out on errands. These work equally well with my tablet, phone, and even my old laptop, which is a relief because not all earbuds I‚Äôve tried manage compatibility this well.

**Strengths**  
- The 90-hour total battery backup is a lifesaver for long trips or outdoor adventures.  
- Comfortable design with secure-fit ear hooks‚Äîperfect for gym buffs or joggers.  
- Crystal-clear call quality even in noisy environments.  
- Sweatproof and durable enough to withstand rigorous activity.  

**Critiques**  
- The bass might feel a little subdued for users who favor heavily bass-driven music.  
- Physical button controls are slightly stiff, which can be a tad frustrating during workouts.  
- The black plastic finish, while functional, may not feel as premium as competitors‚Äô options.  

**Other Options**  
The earbuds landscape is vast, and there are notable players here. Compared to the Jabra Elite 75t, the occiam T19 stands out with its phenomenal battery life but falls behind slightly in sound richness and app compatibility. Against the Beats Powerbeats Pro, these triumph in price, delivering similar stability with ear hooks for a fraction of the cost, though the sound lacks the high-end punch. Budget-conscious users might consider the Soundcore Liberty Neos, but the shorter playtime and less secure earhook make occiam‚Äôs T19 a more tempting choice for fitness fans.

**Quality for Price**  
For this price range, you‚Äôre getting remarkable value. The mix of long battery life, decent audio, and sport-friendly features checks multiple boxes. While some premium earbuds cost double‚Äîor even triple‚Äîthis, they don‚Äôt necessarily offer triple the benefits. These deserve a serious look if practicality and comfort matter more to you than audio nerd-level specs.

I'm looking for a truly authentic connection that has the potential to grow into a meaningful, long-term partnership ‚Äì think building a shared world, not just visiting one.

Life here is a bit of a quiet adventure ‚Äì juggling a remote job, chipping away at studies, and finding comfort in a simple, intentional routine. My ideal evening usually involves diving deep into a sci-fi universe (current obsessions include¬†The Expanse, Silo, Star Trek, Stargate, Foundation), exploring fascinating documentaries, or getting lost in a perfectly curated soundtrack. If you can discuss the theoretical physics of warp drive or the political structures of¬†The Last Kingdom, we're probably off to a great start! I still have a soft spot for gaming and anime, parts of my past that shaped my inner nerd.

I'm not someone who thrives on constant external stimulation. I find joy in the quiet moments, the intellectual rabbit holes, and the comfort of routine. I don't drink, smoke, or do drugs ‚Äì my vices extend to perhaps too much fruit juice and an unwavering loyalty to tea (if you're a coffee person, we can agree to disagree peacefully!).

When I care about someone, I'm all in. I'm the kind of person who wants to be truly¬†present¬†‚Äì to listen, to support, and to navigate life's ups and downs¬†together. I believe relationships flourish on mutual reciprocity, consistent effort, and knowing you have a reliable teammate by your side. I value loyalty, emotional honesty, and showing up consistently when it counts. I guess you could say I value closeness and connection deeply.

I'm genuinely hoping to find an emotionally available woman who feels similarly. Someone kind, open-hearted, and ready to invest in building something real, starting with a solid foundation of friendship and seeing where that authentic connection leads.¬†Please note:¬†To make consistent communication and calls feasible for a growing connection, I'm prioritizing connections where the time difference is ideally¬†no more than about 7 hours¬†from Brazil (BRT, UTC-3).

My future vision is simple but profound: building a peaceful, loving life with a monogamous partner. I dream of a cozy home (maybe a cat or two?), perhaps a bit of quiet countryside eventually, and definitely exploring the world side by side. I'm working towards starting my own company, driven by that desire for a stable, shared future.

This isn't a search for fleeting moments. I'm serious about finding my person for a long-term, deeply connected life.

For me, getting to know someone genuinely means moving beyond text.¬†Voice and video calls are really important to me¬†as we figure out if there's a real spark and connection beyond the words on a screen. If that feels like a good next step for you too, that's a great sign.

If you're a woman whose heart beats for genuine connection, appreciates a reliable nerd, and isn't afraid of building something consistent and deep, please reach out! Tell me a bit about yourself ‚Äì where you are in the world, your age, time zone, and what part of my rambling struck a chord. Low-effort messages tend to get lost in the digital ether; I'm looking for someone ready to put a little mutual energy in from the start.

My husband is not the jealous type and has always accepted my friendship with him. We take walks to get our steps in and when I‚Äôm with him I forget about everything and I don‚Äôt want to go back home.

Back-story: I met my guy friend through my ex best friend years ago in highschool. We‚Äôve always stayed connected and I feel we‚Äôve always had a special relationship.  One day I threw a party at my house he brought a bottle of tequila and we all got very drunk mostly everyone left eventually I noticed he was starting to black out and I was trying to help him lay down and sober up. He told me that ‚Äú he loved me‚Äù. We kissed and got a little touchy but then I stopped because he was drunk . A few years later I think I mentioned it and he denied it. He said that he barely remembers anything from highshcool. I felt embarrassed maybe a little hurt so I left it alone. Fast forward, he came to our wedding. He was actually the last person I saw before I walked down the aisle. When he lived in Miami we visited him and went jet skying my husband had a never use break down so I felt it just sucked the fun out of it. We were having fun.

But recently, I‚Äôm just looking or thinking about our relationship and if there is more there that we‚Äôre just avoiding. We send each other memes non stop daily, he opened up to me about his father who had passed away two years ago in which he says he doesn‚Äôt let himself grieve about, we share music, when we went for lunch one day he sat next to me instead of across, he‚Äôll pay for my coffee or little snacks when I try to pay for my own. Ive also I‚Äôve felt our hands touch by accident a few times. Did I mention we have the same exact birthday? I don‚Äôt want to ruin our friendship I value it so much.

Now that I‚Äôve created even more motifs (some suggested by the community!) and made a few improvements based on your feedback, I wanted to share the updated version with you.

üõ†Ô∏è What‚Äôs new?

* A small bar under the last number so you‚Äôll know exactly when the drawing is finished.
* New cover pictures that show the final drawing for easier selection.
* A safer tool version with **fully enclosed magnets** (top right in the picture) - after some folks raised safety concerns about small magnets around kids.
* STLs and 3MFs are now **clearly named** so you can tell which drawing they belong to at a glance.
* The early Twist Art models have been updated - no more X/Y hole compensation needed!

If you have any other suggestions, feel free to drop a comment - I really appreciate your input.

I was genuinely surprised by how many awesome moms, dads, uncles, aunts and even grandparents and great-grandparents are part of the 3D printing community! üß°

**Here‚Äôs how the toy works:**  
You clamp a sheet of paper between the two parts of the tool (green). Then you place one of the disks into the tool.  
Start by rotating the marker with number 1 to the top and draw the line marked with number 1.  
Next, rotate to number 2 and draw that line, and so on.  
The last number is marked with a small bar underneath it. Once you‚Äôve finished all the steps, lift the disk and the picture will be revealed!

In the end it was not as difficult as I thought it would be and it looked like I gained some benefits (remembering dreams and less muscle pain after waking up) but all in all I was a little bit underwhelmed from the effects after months of decaf or I wasn‚Äôt able to compare objectively.

She's also slow to wake and orient (husband says she's always been a ""don't talk to me until I've had my second cup of coffee"" kind of person). Now she's got dementia and is currently in-hospital. We've had several episodes of her waking from sleep, disoriented and confused only to have staff escalate the situation instead of de-escalation. One of them actually called security on this 100 lb, 5'-nothing little old lady - because she was threatening them.  Not that she'd tried to hit anyone, she was just telling them not to touch her and to leave her alone. The ulitmate solution then was to hit her with some ativan and knock her out for a while. I'm not sure what would have happened had my husband not been there to advocate for her. 

The PT doc came in and absolutely would not listen when I said ""give her a minute"" when she says don't touch her, she means it. Please don't agitate her. Please back off. Nope. I understand that the rules say you have to be within arm's reach. The rules do not say that your body needs to be less than a foot from hers when she is demanding that you give her some space!

This countertop nugget ice machine offers an array of features that make it tempting for anyone obsessed with that iconic soft, chewable ice (you know the kind). At first glance, it had that sleek, compact design I've been craving for my kitchen setup, so naturally, I gave this nifty little device a shot.

**Design and Space Compatibility**

The compact dimensions of 12.99 x 7.28 x 12.79 inches made this product almost tailor-fit to my countertop. With its minimalist black exterior, it instantly elevated the aesthetics of my kitchen. Setting it up was quite straightforward, too‚Äîeverything I needed came in the box: the ice maker itself, a handy ice scoop, an ice basket, and a drip tray. It's lightweight for its size at just under 20 pounds, allowing me to move it without breaking a sweat. I shoved it into a tight space next to my coffee machine, and it blended perfectly without hogging much room. However, while it claims a sleek fit, be prepared for the fan noise‚Äîit‚Äôs noticeable but bearable.

**Chewable Nugget Ice Magic**

Let‚Äôs talk about the pi√®ce de r√©sistance: the chewable nugget ice. I'm talking perfectly soft, elastic ice chunks that my teeth were very thankful for. Whether I paired it with fresh juice, soda, or a late-night cocktail, this ice maker delivered the most satisfying crunch factor. I'm not someone who typically chomps on ice, but this made me a convert. These nuggets preserved the flavors of my drinks beautifully, and dare I say, they made beverages taste fresher. That said, I noticed the textures started to change slightly if the ice wasn‚Äôt used right away‚Äîso for the best experience, consuming it quickly is key.

**Highlights**

- The first round of ice formation happens in just five minutes! It made me feel like a wizard who could summon fresh, chewable ice at will.
- The lightweight build and elegant finish worked perfectly even in my small kitchen space.
- One-touch operation and self-cleaning functionality saved so much hassle. Who wants to deal with manual cleaning? Not me, and thankfully, this machine agrees.

**Automatic Cleaning Made Easy**

This brings me to a feature I truly loved‚Äîthe automatic self-cleaning function. Using it was ridiculously simple. At the press of a single button, the machine got to work, cleaning its interior and flushing out any gunk. I appreciated how it gave me peace of mind; no one wants crusty, residue-filled ice. Still, be sure to drain it fully for a fresh start, as some water tends to linger after the process.

**Upsides**

- Self-cleaning reduces hygiene worries.
- Quick ice production perfect for last-minute parties.
- Compact design fits almost any space.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Even though it's compact, the fan noise may be distracting in quieter spaces like small office environments.
- The machine creates a bit of dripping if you don‚Äôt position the drip tray perfectly.
- Seems to struggle slightly for a consistent texture when ice isn‚Äôt used right away.

**Peer Products**

I couldn't resist comparing the Aeitto model to a few other nugget ice makers I've come across, mainly the GE Profile Opal and the Frigidaire EFIC235. The GE Opal boasts high-end aesthetics and Google integration, but it‚Äôs also significantly larger and demands a heftier price tag. Meanwhile, Frigidaire focuses on simplicity, though it somewhat lacks the sophistication of Aeitto‚Äôs auto-cleaning features and one-touch operation. In terms of price-to-quality ratio, Aeitto strikes a middle ground‚Äîoffering a balance of performance, user convenience, and stylish design.

Where it gives competitors a run for their money is with its chewable ice consistency‚Äîsmooth and satisfying. However, the slightly longer clean-up process compared to the GE Profile Opal might be seen as a chore for some. Deciding between these comes down to priorities: do you want a high-end, tech-laden machine or a fuss-free, space-conscious model like this?

**Affordable Quality**

Price-wise, this ice maker hits a sweet spot. While high-end competitors offer more frills and faster performance, I‚Äôd say this one is fantastic for those seeking chewable ice without an absurd price premium. Plus, the addition of a two-year technical support warranty brings extra confidence in the purchase. In terms of features it offers for what you pay, it checks most of the boxes.

Today, she said she was going to meet a friend before going to work. I said ""Oh nice, who you meeting?"". She said ""Why do I have to tell you who?"". Now, please bare in mind this is a question I always ask her and she always tells me who with no issues so to hear her say this was pretty surprising. I didn't say anything after that but I suddenly felt worried and suspicious, though I figured she was just giving attitude because of our last argument. Anyways, when she left the house, I messaged her that I might be 5 mins late or so in picking her up from work because I'm going to play badminton with friends, that's when I noticed her location was off. This was on snapchat. Now, I'm not a stalker I promise. I only started turning on my own location because she made me do so early on in the relationship and I had no issues with doing so. She has never turned off her location before so I was absolutely stunned. I messaged her on snap about something unrelated to see if maybe the location she's at has bad reception or something but she replied which confirmed that she had manually turned off her location. At this point, I started to get worried af, so I called her and she picked up but the network was kind of shaky,  so she sent a message saying she's with a friend and that the network isn't too strong. I was like ""X(x being a placeholder for her best friend's name)?"" and she said ""No, Do I have to be screened on who I'm meeting"", I replied ""sorry was just curious, didn't mean nothing by it"". Then she sent a snap of a coffee cup and what looked like a coffee shop. 

I'm not gonna lie, my heart is pumping real fast right now, I have a feeling that maybe it's because we argued that why she turned off her location out of anger or something but why the mystery around who she's meeting? Is she just trying to piss me off on purpose? I really don't understand. I don't really want to confront her on why she turned off her location and I don't want to come off as controlling and insecure but this situation is really fishy.

I'm a junior high student, currently in the same class as my ex-best friend‚Äîlet‚Äôs call her Ari. We've been classmates since middle school. She‚Äôs six months younger than me, and we used to be inseparable‚Äîalways hanging out, sharing secrets, and spending time at coffee shops. I often gave her luxury gifts; that‚Äôs just how I show love (Love Language).

Over time, our duo became a trio, then a quartet, a quintet‚Äîthen eventually just the two of us again. We both made it into the same advanced class, where I became close friends with a guy named Nate. I liked him at first, but he had a girlfriend, so we stayed just friends. Ari and another classmate, Kie, thought we were dating because we talked a lot‚Äîmostly about an organization we were in.

In March 2024, a guy from that organization, Sein, confessed he liked me. I gently rejected him but said we could still be friends. Sein‚Äôs best friend, Jai, started dating Kris‚Äîmy classmate, who‚Äôs known for causing drama. Kris accused me of being in a secret relationship with Nate and of sending explicit messages‚Äînone of which were true. She also stole from me and cursed me out for not spending enough time with her. I confided everything to Ari, hoping she'd have my back.

Despite everything, I tried to keep the peace in the organization and continued hanging out with them. Eventually, I cut off contact with Kris and Sein, but stayed friends with Jai, who hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong.

Earlier in 2024, I started talking to a guy named Ric. We hit it off and began dating in August after he transferred to my school. Even after that, I still made time for Ari and Kie. In November, I gave them gifts to celebrate our friendship anniversaries. They accepted them, but not long after, they drifted away to hang out with others. By December‚Äîon my birthday‚ÄîAri messaged me to say our friendship was over, accusing me of choosing my boyfriend over them.

Later, I found out Ari had been spending time with Kris, who had been calling me names for dating Ric. Ari and her group spread rumors, called me a bad friend, and even made up lies about me to my family. Lexi, another mutual friend, told me they were talking badly about her too. We agreed to ignore them unless it was absolutely necessary for school.

Now Ari says I made her feel left out, even though she‚Äôs the one who ended our friendship. Kei sided with her, saying I threw away two years of friendship for a five-day relationship‚Äîwithout knowing the full story or that I had already known Ric before he transferred. Nate distanced himself because of the rumors, and my boyfriend still doesn‚Äôt know any of this. I don‚Äôt want to burden him with drama he doesn‚Äôt deserve.

Ric and I are still together‚Äîwe just celebrated our nine months. And for any of you who's wondering, our families know we're dating.

I was in a relationship for nearly a year, long distance which is difficult regardless. I tried really, really hard to be a good partner. I tried using I-statements, I tried being direct about my needs, I tried just‚Ä¶I tried to do what I thought was healthy as much as I could. I have been in therapy and dbt, to deal with my anxious attachment and some emotional dysregulation. For the most part I‚Äôve done really well I think. I‚Äôve been loving and attentive and ‚Ä¶ I think I was a good partner overall.

Um, so there was a lot of conflict. I think like‚Ä¶he was definitely mean to me, and I felt neglected a lot and I had to really speak up often about my needs not being met. He‚Äôd forget dates, he‚Äôd go weeks without asking me questions or trying to communicate beyond ‚Äúhow‚Äôs it going‚Äù or responding to my attempts at engagement. He‚Äôs been very busy, working a stressful job and studying for a certification. He‚Äôd cuss at strangers for small things and tell me he was going to start recording our conversations. 

So I broke up with him in February, but he asked for another chance and I gave it to him. And he did really well for the most part‚Ä¶he listened to me without getting too upset and he even asked me on a couple video call dates. He would text me with less delays. 

So, the past couple weeks I was starting to feel like‚Ä¶I was pulling most of the weight with our connection. I would share things about my day, I would try to suggest topics of conversation, and I‚Äôd get back short answers, or nothing. He offered a couple coffee dates by video which was nice, but early in the morning before work, so nice for brief connection‚Ä¶I enjoyed it.

I didn‚Äôt really say anything though, I think because it took a while to filter through to my awareness that that‚Äôs how I was feeling. Then on Friday I started to experience this really like big emotional turmoil, feeling grief and loss over a pregnancy, just‚ÄîI‚Äôve had a very difficult year and it‚Äôs been. I mean I just was having a hard time and I was crying and just felt alone. I didn‚Äôt communicate to him how upset I was. I guess I thought I did but I didn‚Äôt. 

He had a work get together and he was there like until 1am. And I tried not to ruin it by telling him how upset I was. But by the end of it I was feeling this really intense anger that he could go have conversation for hours with other people, while I got just nearly nothing from him. He‚Äôs said he‚Äôs burnt out and drained and has zero left after work and studying, so that‚Äôs what I get. And I was so SO jealous and angry that these other people got that. 

I had a hard time controlling it. I tried looking at my dbt stuff, and I made the mistake of looking at emotional regulation instead of distress tolerance. I just felt so dysregulated. When we talked as he was on his way home he‚Äôd been drinking and seemed giddy, and I was just‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt control myself enough. I was angry, I said how I get nothing from him but a 30 minute phone call when I‚Äôm crying (my fault for not communicating better I was still upset the rest of the day and he DID ask me a couple times how I was doing but I didn‚Äôt want to ruin his night or) and I get nothing from him for weeks but he can go out and spend hours talking and drinking with other people. I was so angry. I didn‚Äôt yell I don‚Äôt think but it was obvious I was angry. 

He told me we‚Äôre obviously different people and he‚Äôs not the person for me and I hung up on him. And then we tried talking the next day, but he said he wasn‚Äôt sure if he wanted to break up or not so I said that‚Äôs not ok with me, I‚Äôm not going to wait around while someone decides like that. I think I deserve better than what I‚Äôve been given.

I feel really bad that I messed up though by being so angry. I think he was doing a really good job at like trying to suggest dates which was new for him. It feels unfair that he can mess up a lot but I mess up and it‚Äôs just, that‚Äôs it. Anyway‚Ä¶I just feel really awful I couldn‚Äôt control my anger or do better. I just ‚Ä¶ I just didn‚Äôt know what to do in the moment. And I feel like it ruined everything.",3,1747055314.0,emotionalintelligence,5,1.0,False
1kks33o,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_JosefKWriter/comments/1kks33o/advice_for_aspiring_writers/,Advice For Aspiring Writers,"Writing. What is it? How do you become a writer? How do you become anything? Go to school. Take courses. Send them a CV. Get a job in your field. But you‚Äôre not a writer until you‚Äôve got a book on a shelf. Until you‚Äôre published. That‚Äôs it. Get published. Then no one can say anything. But how do you get published? I‚Äôll tell you. Write something. Get it printed. Bam!

Every now and then I meet one of those people. You know the type.

But are you published?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Then, with no more words, they give you a dismissive brush-off. Those people just want to sound cool. They act the part. They‚Äôre posers. They want to seem like an expert. Esse Quam Videri: To Be Rather Than To Seem. Kim Kardashian. You know what I mean? Do you really want to be a writer? Do you write? Or do you want to be rich and famous? Writing cannot be achieved with a lottery ticket or a sextape. So what‚Äôs my advice to aspiring writers? Stop aspiring.

Aspiring gives me the heebie-jeebies. It‚Äôs too much like hoping. You‚Äôll never hope a novel or a screenplay. Am I bitter? Bittersweet. I‚Äôm one of those writers. Must have Russian in me. You‚Äôre a writer if people are interested in what you say, if people are held in thrall by your insight, if you have something to say, if you write.

Every job I‚Äôve had has been a denial of my true self. People would ask me, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù Missing my calling. You? I got the urge when I was nine. You know the urge. Some call it the muse. Whatever it is, for some reason, you sit down and need‚ÄîNEED‚Äîto say something.

Am I boring you? Do hate you the written word? Is it too much work to read more than 160 characters? Then just jog on. Sell shoelaces. Ok. I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm an asshole writer. You want some writing advice? Here:

Advice to aspiring writers: Write what you know. Writing is Rewriting. Rejection is part of it. Love the blank page. Know your audience. Write compelling characters. Define your theme. Create obstacles for your characters. Have your characters overcome obstacles. Generate conflict. Structure a plot.

But wait‚Äîyou‚Äôre nowhere near knowing what to do right? Ok fine. Here: You‚Äôre not a writer until you try something that has immense romantic appeal but requires almost no effort. Forget everything I‚Äôve said so far and follow these steps‚Äîto the letter:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Get a warm cozy feeling about being a writer. These feelings should be vague and attached to misconceptions in your mind regarding the authors and poets you‚Äôve seldom read, but have heard cool stories about.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Make a cup of tea, coffee or a latte. Whatever your drink of choice is. But it must be hot, because writing is about that warm fuzzy feeling.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sit in front of your laptop, or if you want, a type-writer because it makes that *ch-ch* noise that denotes literary progress in the minds of people who want to be writers.

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Load your word processor or if it‚Äôs a type-writer insert the crackling dead flesh of a tree. (Cuz fuck global warming and white-out gets you high.)

5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Take a sip of tea.

6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Make sure you‚Äôve got the formatting. Page numbers are essential for when you get some pages.

7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The first page MUST be the title page. Because it feels productive. Like tossing some butter and onions in a hot pan smells productive. And you ARE a Chef! Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you different.

8.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Your title must sound huge. Something like: The Beast of Eternity, The Spinning Earth is My Only Home or The Eyes Linger in the West.

9.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Be sure to put in your Byline. The word ‚ÄúBy‚Äù and then your name.¬† Consider a Nom de Plume. Something immensely literary. Perhaps Tristan Plymouth or Miranda Kilborn.

10.¬†¬† Crack your fuckin‚Äô knuckles! Sip your fuckin‚Äô tea! And then answer that text from Mary. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù she says. And you say, ‚ÄúJust working on my book.‚Äù Says Mary: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to interrupt.‚Äù Says you: ‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs okay. What‚Äôs up?‚Äù Says Mary, ‚ÄúFiona caught Todd cheating on Wilma with Sebastian.‚Äù You say, ‚ÄúOMG I‚Äôm coming over.‚Äù Then run over to Mary‚Äôs to blither about some trivial bullshit.

11.¬†¬† IMPORTANT! At some point there will be a lull in your gossip. Someone will ask, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the book coming along?‚Äù THIS IS YOUR BIG CHANCE. This is where you seal the deal and become a writer par excellence. You MUST have a snappy answer. You MUST be as casual as fuck. As you peer over the rim or your mug sipping your tea say this: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a work in progress. I‚Äôm glad to have a break. But the plot lacks cohesion and the characters need to be fleshed out. Structurally, it‚Äôs in the beginning phases. Almost done the first draft.‚Äù

12.¬†¬† WHAMMO! YOU‚ÄôRE WRITER.

But seriously. You don‚Äôt want to be a Writer. You want to be a *Titler*: You know? One of those people who have great titles for a book? An *Idea-For-A-Book Comer-Upper-Wither*.

And another thing. If you‚Äôve achieved great success in a field that has nothing to do with writing, speaking or words in any form, you‚Äôre not a writer. Let‚Äôs say that you worked your way up from intern to CEO of a bottling company. It may be that you‚Äôve achieved success in that field and you can formulate an email. And all you‚Äôve been writing for five decades is the occasional article for your company‚Äôs newsletter: *A Few Words On Bottle Futures.*

And just like Don Quixote, the most delusional guy of all time, doesn‚Äôt need to test his shield‚Äînot because it‚Äôs solid but because it‚Äôs a flimsy a bag of smashed assholes‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need to edit or rewrite; not because you‚Äôve expressed everything perfectly, but because you just like the feeling having written something. Just type whatever comes to mind and hit send like it said ‚ÄúClick here to be a Writer.‚Äù

Oh, but it‚Äôs all good, because you thought it might be nice at the age of retirement, which is to say, fifteen years from death, that you wouldn‚Äôt mind doing a little writing. Wouldn‚Äôt mind dabbling. Fuck dabblers! Dabble this!

Let me ask you this: Would you like to do a little writing when the Reaper‚Äôs battin‚Äô down your front door? Great. Do that.

Here‚Äôs what I love: The fact that I don‚Äôt want to know anything about the writers I read. Because they invariably turn out to be degenerate or abused or cynical or spiteful or smarter than me. They‚Äôve experienced at least one thing. Writers don‚Äôt write, they desperately seek to articulate or purge or escape or warn people of what horrendous or beautiful, joyful or despairing, hellish or heavenly predator lurks behind the black night-shadow or the blinding wall of light.

Advice to aspiring writers: If you smile when you write you‚Äôre doing it wrong.

Do you have a bunch of shit lying around that will never be complete? If no, get some. Then you‚Äôre close to being a writer. Are you plagued by thoughts and ideas that could never be expressed by human language and which come at a rate so fast one could never hope to write it down before it metastasizes? No? Not a writer.

Advice to aspiring writers: Stop aspiring. Writers don‚Äôt aspire. They think. They conjure up ideas. Ideas that could never be expressed in 160 characters or less. Seriously. Did you ever see those people that write one sentence books?

Those are not books! Those are sentences!

Advice for aspiring writers: Letters make up words. Words make up sentences. And sentences make up? Do you know? No? Are you aspiring right now?

Paragraphs. Sentences make up *Paragraphs*. And depending on how those paragraphs go together and how many there are, you might have any number of written documents, up to and including, but not limited to: An Essay, A Vignette, A Short Story or, mayhap, may-just-hap, a Book. A Book! Don‚Äôt you wish you could walk up to someone, look them dead in the eyes and say, ‚ÄúI wrote a book!‚Äù

They are guaranteed to be singularly gobsmacked. Glory of Glories! ‚ÄúYou wrote a book!?‚Äù they say. And you? You‚Äôre as casual as fuck. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù says you. I can promise you many things now. If you do write one and you do tell someone they will rarely ask you to read it. Like as not they‚Äôll fear you. That‚Äôs why they kill writers in any political revolution. But if they do say something it will be this: How many pages is it? Because the more pages there are, the more impressive it is

Advice to aspiring writers: Writing a book is not impressive. Writing a GOOD book is impressive.

Advice to aspiring writers: Can you please have something to say?

Nietchze: ‚ÄúMy ambition is to say in ten propositions what everyone else says in a whole book‚Äîwhat they *do not* say in a whole book.‚Äù

Conrad: ‚ÄúI was within a hair‚Äôs breadth of the last opportunity for pronouncement, and I found with humiliation that I had nothing to say. This is why I affirm that Kurtz was a remarkable man. He had something to say.‚Äù

You know? Actually had something to say? Even if it‚Äôs only two words. That‚Äôs where it‚Äôs at. And you read the whole book, looking for this guy in the jungles of Africa, only to find that he‚Äôs got some wasting disease, gone off the deep end, nothing but a cannibalizing, murdering, torturing, mutilating, degenerate with rotting heads on spikes and all he‚Äôs got to say is, ‚ÄúThe Horror. The Horror.‚Äù

But that says it all.

If there‚Äôs one thing that annoys writers, it‚Äôs non-writers that talk about writing like you could apprentice or read the manual. You know the type: Hopeless romantic with a penchant for profundity. They love it when they read something and their mind is blown because they dimly perceived the subtext.

Advice for aspiring writers: Creative writing courses teach people how to teach creative writing courses. Those who can‚Äôt, teach.

You can‚Äôt write what you *don‚Äôt* know. Writing is re-writing? Re-writing is writing! Rejection is for parole hearings! I wipe my *ass* with blank pages!

PS: I‚Äôm not the best writer, so I used AI to help me organize my thoughts.

My first-ever job was at a sandwich shop when I was 16. That‚Äôs where I met a girl ‚Äî let‚Äôs call her ‚ÄúG‚Äù . We were coworkers, and over time, we fell for each other and started dating. After about a year together, we broke up. This was back in 2019, just before the pandemic.

We stayed together until the end of 2020. After the breakup, we completely lost contact. We didn‚Äôt talk or see each other ‚Äî we both had time to grow and figure ourselves out.

Then, in July of 2024, G reached out again. She‚Äôd gotten into an argument with her dad and was wondering if things like that had affected our past relationship. I told her no ‚Äî the truth was, our relationship ended because I (24M) didn‚Äôt put in the effort it takes to make something real last. That part was on me.

We started hanging out again ‚Äî first that week, then the next, and the week after that. Eventually, I told her I still liked her. She agreed to see where things might go and to talk things out. But after about two weeks, she ended things again. I accepted it and tried to move on.

Fast forward to January: I was at a coffee shop when she texted me asking if I wanted to go rollerskating. I said yes. After skating, we sat in the car and talked. She said she was open to giving things another shot ‚Äî and so we did.

The first three months felt amazing. I was falling for her again, deeply. At one point, I asked if she was open to being in a relationship. She told me that relationships take a lot of work and she wasn‚Äôt really open to one. I asked again ‚Äî three times in total ‚Äî and got the same answer every time.

And now‚Ä¶ here we are.

We had the ‚Äúhoneymoon phase‚Äù ‚Äî the sweet stuff: kissing, hanging out, feeling connected. But now I only see her maybe once a week. We barely text. We barely call. We barely do anything together.

Call me delusional. Maybe I‚Äôve been influenced by social media or just have unrealistic expectations. But I don‚Äôt feel seen. I don‚Äôt feel cared for. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm even in a relationship. It just feels like casual conversation with someone I used to know more deeply.

I‚Äôve told her I‚Äôd like to see her more ‚Äî at least three times a week. I get it, we both work. But I genuinely believe that when someone matters to you, you make time. Saying you‚Äôre busy every single day just doesn‚Äôt seem realistic ‚Äî people make time for the ones they care about.

But every time I think that, her words ‚Äî ‚Äúa relationship takes a lot of work‚Äù ‚Äî ring loudly in the back of my head and stop me from saying anything more.

And if I‚Äôm being really honest, a big part of this might be about me not wanting to be alone. I know people say, ‚ÄúLove yourself first,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúBe okay by yourself,‚Äù and I get it. I‚Äôve done that for years. But honestly? That feeling still sucks. Being alone sucks. And that‚Äôs something I rarely admit out loud.

We even have a trip to the beach coming up this weekend ‚Äî just the two of us, for three days.

I‚Äôm scared to bring any of this up and ruin the vibe, but the way I feel right now is hard to keep pushing down.

I care about her, but I‚Äôm unsure how to bring this up without overwhelming her or pushing her away.",2,1747055119.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I've yet to find an Americano I like -- they are too bitter for me and I just don't love the over sweetness and heaviness of lattes except an occasional treat in the winter.

Prefer coffee shops instead of diner vibes since I'm looking for places I

So far the only one I've come across is All Good in Weaverville which I LOVE. but looking for other places for when I'm out and about.

1kkry6l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kkry6l,Mancera Mega Haul + Reviews,"Got these 9 Mancera Fragrances from Scentoria. Was planning to try them from so long so finally decided to sample them and I'm not at all disappointed. 


This will be a brief and short first impressions review although I do agree that 1st impressions don't mean much in this hobby as our olfactory perception changes and keeps evolving with time . so won't be commenting on performance as of now. Will update once I have used them for a month or so. 



1. AMORE CAFFE  - most photo-realistic coffee perfume I've ever tried. Closer to a black coffee than a sweet cappuccino imo . Has a slight nuttiness & chocolate nuances to my nose although no chocolate notes officially mentioned. Strong boozy coffee with undertones of sweet vanilla. Not overtly sweet like nebras or Khamrah qahwa. Vaguely reminds me of Jack Daniels Honey .  Would recommend sampling before buying. 
Scent profile rating for me - 9/10 ( subjective ) 





2. ROSES VANILLE - Not much happening here , just sweet roses with musky vanilla in the base.  Rose feels very fresh and slightly citrus rather than jammy. Definitely leans feminine. 
Scent profile rating for me - 7/10 




3. AOUD LEMON MINT  - I had more expectations from this one given the hype it holds. Smells cheap and synthetic to my nose. Its citrus + synthetic oud with some touches of leathery undertones which overall smells like plastic to me.  Although Safe for summers but would strongly recommend not to blind buy this one.  I would surely give this more tries and time .
Scent profile Rating for me - 7/10 




4. CEDRAT BOISE  - so I already have the Cedrat Boise intense and decided to get the OG also. Honestly I love it. It's more easy going , mass pleasing than the intense version. It's more fruity , sweet than the CBI. Surely reminds of cdnim and other Aventus clones  but unique enough to have both in the collection. 
Scent profile rating for me - 9/10 




5. LEMON LINE - This is the most realistic smelling Lemon Fragrance I've ever tried. Think of the outer zesty lemon skin and not the juice. It's slightly sweet - citrus combination which makes it standout. It's not harsh or cheap synthetic smelling like the opening of club de nuit but much better.  Some might call it the lemon cleaner but I guess it's subjective. Perfect for hot Indian summers. 
Scent profile rating - 9/10 




6. TONKA COLA - The most unique smell I've ever tried in any Fragrance. Think of a cherry cola when you 1st open the can with all the fizz . Smells like kala- khatta with loads of fizz. Not sure if anyone wants to smell like a soft drink. Patchouli, coca- cola are the most dominant notes I get. Can be polarizing hence would recommend to sample before buying a full bottle. 
Scent profile rating for me - 8.5/10 




7. COCO VANILLE - Although this one is a feminine scent , I decided to try it for my love for coconut . It's beautiful. I get less coconut and more peach. It's smooth , fruity , creamy with hints of vanilla. Smells very tropical like a luxury Sunscreen. It has slight hints of citrus in the opening probably from the peach note which balances out the sweetness perfectly.  
Scent profile rating - 8.5/10




8. HOLIDAYS -  Smells very similar to coco vanille as both have some common notes. Less sweet and more unisex than the former. 
Rating - 7/10




9. FRENCH RIVIERA -  Saved the best for the last. I'm already in love with this one. The opening immediately will remind you of Chanel Allure homme sport eau extreme or Missoni Wave. But it's more creamy and fresher . Opening has notes of orange and Mandarin. It has a tiare flower note in the mids  which is a white floral and imparts a creamy touch to the scent . It's a sweet and  Aquatic with hints of salt in the base. Super fresh and mass pleasing. Smells slightly like fabric softener or an expensive detergent but in a good way . Got this cute 60ml bottle and will surely upgrade to the full once I run out of this. 

Anyone who did not review it intentionally was surely gatekeeping this. Blind buy worthy imo. 

My rating - 10/10 



Just a small pro-tip for all the newbies out here. Get these tester strips from Amazon . These are a  real game changer if you really want to try and test multiple Fragrances and up your olfactory perception Game.

1kkry65,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kkry65/my_father_has_been_jobless_for_10_years_and_does/,My Father Has Been Jobless for 10 Years and Does Nothing. AITA for Being Frustrated?,"**T**L;DR: My unemployed dad (45M) who hasn‚Äôt worked in 10 years, does nothing at home, and lets my doctor mom (45F) do everything. He¬†*could*¬†work (waiter, mechanic, etc.) but refuses out of pride. Meanwhile, Mom cooks, cleans, and financially supports him while he sleeps until 1:30 PM, smokes, and pretends to be ""busy."" AITA for wanting to explode at him?

here‚Äôs me yapping:

My father (45M) lost his job 10 years ago and has been unemployed ever since. There‚Äôs a complicated situation I (18F) can‚Äôt fully explain, but essentially, he can no longer work for the government. However, he¬†*could*¬†absolutely find another job- he could be a waiter, a mechanic‚Ä¶ anything! When I mentioned this to my mom (45F), a doctor, she said he¬†*did*¬†look for jobs but thing never worked out for him (huh?) Apparently five years ago, he and a friend tried to start a business, but his friend backed out, and that‚Äôs it. Now my dad just stays home all day. Like I said, he could take on a less prestigious job, but I think he can‚Äôt¬†*kendine yediremiyor*¬†(can‚Äôt swallow his pride) because he used to hold a high position. But that doesn‚Äôt make sense‚Äîsure, he was fired and can‚Äôt return to that level, but¬†*some*¬†money is better than¬†*no*¬†money, right?

The sole breadwinner is my mom. She‚Äôs a doctor who works night shifts 7-8 times a month. She wakes up at 6 AM, makes food for my brother (13M), drives him to school, goes to the hospital by 8 AM, comes home at 1 PM to cook lunch for my brother and my¬†*father*‚Äîwho literally waits in bed for her to wake him up! All he does is smoking all day (I can hear his footsteps and the sound of him lighting cigarettes upstairs). He brushes his teeth, goes back to sleep, and waits for mom to come home. He finally wakes up around 1:30 PM, comes downstairs, and says,¬†*""Ooooh, welcome home, honey! What are you cooking for us?""*¬†It makes my blood boil.

And my mom? She‚Äôs an angel. She‚Äôs¬†*still*¬†grieving his job loss. Okay, we were all sad when it happened, but it‚Äôs been¬†*10 fucking years*. Get over it! But she can‚Äôt. She treats him like he‚Äôll burst into tears if anyone criticizes him. Any mention of why he‚Äôs home all day is off-limits.

My mom returns from work at 5 PM, and I guess my dad doesn‚Äôt want to look useless in front of her, so he leaves the house at 4:30 PM. She comes home, cooks dinner,¬†*evi topluyor*¬†(cleans the house), helps my brother with homework, and deals with his tantrums (he yells at her when he doesn‚Äôt want to study, but she takes it like a saint). Then, the second my brother finishes and starts playing on his phone, suddenly, he‚Äôs the¬†*perfect son*‚Äîjust as my dad strolls back in at 10 PM! She half-heartedly nags,¬†*""Where were you? Why are you so late?""*¬†but it‚Äôs just for show. My dad just laughs it off.

I try to help my mom as much as I can‚ÄîI do laundry, set the table, make salads‚Äîbut she won‚Äôt let me do more, telling me to focus on studying (I‚Äôm in 12th grade, with university entrance exams in June). But y‚Äôknow who else could help?¬†you guessed it right*!*¬†Dad**!** I‚Äôm not even saying he¬†*has*¬†to get a job (though imo he absolutely should) He could at least¬†*cook*‚Äîhe worked as a cook when he was younger and isn‚Äôt bad at it! When I brought it up and said he could even be a cashier or something, my mom said,¬†*""I‚Äôm a doctor‚Äîit‚Äôd be embarrassing for my husband to work as a cashie.""*¬†I replied,¬†*""Who cares? Isn‚Äôt it worse for him to be a jobless man lying around all day?""*¬†She just said,¬†*""Whatever,""*and shut the conversation down. I don‚Äôt want to upset her further, but this has gone on for¬†*so long*, and he‚Äôs not even trying. 

Today, I had an exam at 4:30 PM. My mom asked,¬†*""\[Father‚Äôs name\], can you drop Jane off?""*¬†He whined,¬†*""What, am I supposed to wait around until 4 PM to drive her?""*¬†So my mom said,¬†*""Fine, I‚Äôll leave work early and take her.""*It‚Äôs now 4:10 PM. He‚Äôs been smoking upstairs for 2.5 hours and will come down at 4:20 PM to say,¬†*""Bye, Jane! Your mom‚Äôs picking you up, right?""*

I‚Äôm¬†*so*¬†mad. I know I should be studying instead of obsessing over this, but I‚Äôm heartbroken watching my mom waste her life like this. When he comes downstairs, I want to snap,¬†*""Why did you complain as if you weren‚Äôt gonna be home until 4:30 anyway?""* I want to ask my mom why she‚Äôs still married to him.¬†*Mom, you‚Äôre not his mother. You don‚Äôt have to feed him every single day. A marriage shouldn‚Äôt be like this.*¬†But I‚Äôd never say that‚Äîit would crush her. I‚Äôve seriously wondered if she‚Äôs ever considered divorce, but she‚Äôd be devastated. In my entire life, I‚Äôve never seen them kiss or sleep in the same room (he snores, so he sleeps upstairs. also we have a garden about 10 minutes away by car, and when he¬†*does*¬†leave the house, he goes there‚Ä¶ to smoke, eat, and drink coffee.)

I¬†*should*¬†study. I¬†*should*¬†focus on lifting this burden off my mom by getting into a top university and making good money. That‚Äôs the plan. But I can‚Äôt stop fixating on my dad‚Äôs unbelievable behavior.

I might get hate for this post, but no‚Äîit‚Äôs all just¬†*so*¬†weird. I wish someone could see this and tell me a way out. The answer is obvious: I need to succeed so I can help my mom. But I‚Äôm about to lose it and explode at both of them. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this‚Äîmaybe venting will give me some relief.

Once, I snapped. My mom asked me to do laundry, and as I walked to the laundry room, I saw my dad lounging on the couch. I said,¬†*""Can‚Äôt you get up and help me?""*¬†in a sharp tone. He groaned,¬†*""Since when are you so disrespectful? Just say, ‚ÄòGet your ass up‚Äô‚Äîthat‚Äôs what you meant.""*

*Yes dad! U finally get* it*!*¬†But nope‚Äîmy mom brought him coffee, and they drank it while he‚Ä¶ kept lying there.

Now, he‚Äôs coming downstairs‚Ä¶¬†*ha!*¬†Just as my mom arrives to pick me up.

I‚Äôm so done. But for now, I‚Äôll grit my teeth, study hard, and give my mom the life she deserves.

1kkruvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1kkruvy/day_60_update/,Day 60 UPDATE,"Made it to day 60 Zyn free after around 2 years of use - was using around 60mg a day, from when I woke up to when I fell asleep. Wanted to share an update for some light at the end of the tunnel for some others powering through withdrawal symptoms because this sub helped me tremendously!

Background - late 20‚Äôs male, workout 5x a week, 10k+ steps a day, eat clean 80% of the time.

I have never dealt with any struggles of anxiety, brain fog, depression, or other withdrawal symptoms commonly seen on this subreddit.

THE START - 

Early this year I took a promotion at work and was elated and excited. Came with more stress for sure. I had a zyn in all hours of the day, and drank 4-5 cups of black coffee a day. First week of March I had a work meeting where I upset someone important to me - looking back, it was a self reflection on them and their performance but it was the first time where I felt off - hard to breathe, dizzy, just wanted to escape.

During that week later, I had a few other episodes of anxiety or panic attack and started to think WTF is going on - had a full blown panic attack standing in line at Costco, then went to make some returns at UPS and could barely manage. 

Rapidly identified it was likely my use of caffeine + nicotine combo, and stumbled across this subreddit - reading stories of people having similar symptoms. Immediately quit. 

THE RECOVERY - 

Day 1-30 - anyone who has experienced anxiety or a panic attack knows the undue stress it takes on your body. Mine were uncontrollable. Social situations, work meetings, turning on my Zoom camera - anything that wasn‚Äôt my immediate family, close friends basically turned my brain into immediate anxiety and dizziness like I was going to faint. Fortunately powered through it, and slowly slowly made progress. By the end of 30 days, was able to go to the grocery store again without fear of a panic attack. Other settings still stressed me out - I was worried to get a haircut at the barber shop - in the chair I could feel the anxiety rising but was able to tuck it away and get through. ANYONE going through the first 30 days - ITS BRUTAL - but just reinforce, you‚Äôre NOT permanently broken, and it will PASS WITH TIME 

Day 30-60 - enter brain fog - didn‚Äôt have it the first 30 days - super annoying to deal with and honestly didn‚Äôt really notice it starting to lift until day 50. I noticed that that anxiety episodes would be tied to not thinking clearly and having brain fog so they came in tandem. However, it wasn‚Äôt all day - it would happen about 3-4 times a day, then around day 45 it dropped to 1-2. Today is day 60, I‚Äôve been free of brain fog for about a week - still get a little anxiety - much better and more manageable- example I have is Friday last week we went out for a happy hour at a loud restaurant and my fight or flight kicked in - wasn‚Äôt a full blown attack by any means, but was just uncomfortable to be in my own body for about 10 minutes until my stressors came down. 

Other notes or experiences day 30-60 - had to fly on a plane around day 30. I was mortified. Went through airport security and standing in line I had the spins and my hearing kept going in and out. Made it through thankfully, just kept telling myself ‚Äúyou are FINE, it‚Äôs just your brain healing‚Äù. The actual plane ride I was just able to sleep and woke up when we landed so that felt good. 


OTHER NOTES -

I see a lot of people jump on here and share crazy symptoms - YES it‚Äôs probably from nicotine, and you should quit. Just chatGPT what nicotine is doing to your brain, it‚Äôs chemically altering it - that can‚Äôt be a good thing. Symptoms I faced were anxiety, brain fog, dizziness, weird vision at times, hearing going in and out, numbness in my left arm like having a heart attack, all scary shit which I‚Äôve never dealt with. 

There were so many days where I would freak out because I never knew if I‚Äôd get back to normal. I am confident now that I will - but going through it and having that weigh on you is tough. 

I DID notice that a lot of people that have a tougher time with withdrawals like me faced a ‚Äúcrash out‚Äù or experience where they basically had a panic or anxiety attack while STILL ON zyn. Could be something too that, just assuming we‚Äôve all overloaded our central nervous system and it basically crashed out on us and is restarting like a piece of technology (except our brains take a minimum 90 days to restart)

On day 60 I can say that I‚Äôm not 100% healed yet - probably around 60-70%, but can function in life normally at a minimum. I would say I‚Äôm even better than that, but it‚Äôs just a terrible feeling knowing that there could be an anxiety or panic attack looming around the corner. I‚Äôm going to keep pushing to 90 days and will share an update, but I can say with certainty that ALL of my symptoms were from zyn.  Goodluck to everyone battling and I‚Äôll see you at 90 days!!!

(Sorry for format, on mobile). I just need to know if I‚Äôm way out of pocket before I say anything.

I, 19F am home for Mother‚Äôs Day weekend. My stepdad 51M, married my mom when I was 17 (important.) I have never lived with him for longer than the three months in summer before I went to my first year of college. My stepdad has a history of ignoring things he doesn‚Äôt think are ‚Äòhis‚Äô problem. My mom has another dog, who sometimes will potty in the house. He will step over it. But, my mom is expected to clean after the cat (who was his before the marriage). 

My dog is 11. He was originally the family dog, and my mom adopted him when he was 1. When I left for college he couldn‚Äôt handle it and became extremely depressed and she gifted him to me. So, he has lived with my parents before. (Alone with them for six months when I was at college the first semester)

Anyways - onto the issue. My dog has senior onset seizures. He has, for over two years. He is medicated and I take extreme care not to rile him up too much, but sometimes other dogs barking can get him excited and he‚Äôll have one. He loses all control of his bowels and makes a horrid whining/gasping sound as he cannot breath and actively seizes. 

Today, the mail came and my parents other dog riled him up. I was brushing my teeth, and I heard from downstairs his trademark cry/wheezing noise, so I ran down. He had been seizing for long enough to pee himself and get it all over him. My stepdad was just sitting at the table drinking his coffee ignoring it.

Like - pretending it wasn‚Äôt happening. Now, in my experience, comforting my dog not only makes the seizures shorter, but he also doesn‚Äôt pee himself. (He has not peed himself in over a year since I‚Äôve comforted him while they happen.)

And I know that realistically he couldn‚Äôt have really helped but like.. he didn‚Äôt call my name, and he also didn‚Äôt even get up to see what was going on. He was just eating his breakfast and drinking his coffee while my dog was struggling to breath and seizing on the ground.

When I pointed it out, saying ‚ÄúOMG (dog name) is having a seizure!‚Äù He just shrugged and went ‚Äúyeah I guess.‚Äù

In January I found out he had been developing a relationship with a much younger woman that he used to work with. I knew he had been texting her for quite a while. Our kids are also friends and go to school together. I thought at the time that that's the only thing that was going on. On a Sunday in January, he lied to me in order to meet her for coffee. He was with her for 3 ish hours. I found out immediately when he got home. I was just gutted. He'd never lied to me like that. Looked me in the eyes, smiled at me, and lied.

He told me that he lied to me to ""protect my feelings"" and also because he knew I wouldn't want him to spend time with her. Probably because a couple months prior I had expressed to him that I was uncomfortable with her. She came to our house with her son and there was just something there between the two of them that I picked up on right away.  I told him directly that it made me uncomfortable, but he continued to communicate with her via text, and probably in person, though I don't know for sure. (they no longer worked together at the time)

The last 5 months have been hell for me. He insists that it's just a friendship. He wants nothing more from her, and she wants nothing more from him. I have tried to convince myself time and again that this should be okay. I should feel okay with him and this woman spending time together or texting every day.  We even spent time with her and her kids on a hike a couple weeks ago. I felt pretty weird about it, but I didn't feel like there was any kind of physical attraction.  My husband doesn't have many people. He's not close with his family and doesn't make friends easily. 

Last week, I wrote him a letter because we haven't been communicating very well face-to-face. It always ends in a fight. I poured my heart out. I told him exactly how I was feeling and why. He responded and told me why he is so intent on keeping this relationship. How this friendship makes him a ""better person"", how the music she shared with him ""opened a deep well of emotion"", how he feels a deep connection with her that he hasn't felt before, or at least since he was a kid. 

So, am I overreacting? He says it's a give and take, mature, adult relationship. From what I can tell, she is asking him for advice, asking him to look over her college papers and give her feedback, also they have spent time together hiking and having a picnic. (!) The letter he wrote also confirmed that they are having some pretty deep conversations. They have connected through similar childhood/young adult issues/trauma. He repeatedly tells me that I'm controlling and can't understand why I would want to take this from him. To me, he is in the beginning of an emotional affair. 

He has just cut off contact with her becuase it got to the point that I was trying so hard to make this okay in my mind, I basically had a nervous breakdown. He is extremely upset about it. We are totally disconnected emotionally right now.  He spends most of our time together ""being quiet"" which makes me question his commitment to ""moving forward"" together. I'm pretty sure he thinks that I will change my mind, but you guys...I just won't be okay with this. I have tried every way I know how to be okay and that ended in my wanting to check into a mental-health facility. The thought of them spending time alone together and having this deep of a connection fills me with all of the ugly feelings. Things weren't great between us when all of this started. It was a huge wake-up call to me that our marriage was falling apart and he is looking for connection elsewhere. 

We have promised each other that we are going to try to get past this as neither of us want to split up. I don't want to do that to our kids. But I don't see him making much of an effort because he is so sad about losing this ""friendship"". 

I want someone to tell me I'm wrong! There are other factors here that I haven't gotten into, but I am trying not to skew my perspective too much. I am just so, so sad it's come to this. ",43,1747054179.0,Marriage,70,0.94,False

1kkrgh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1kkrgh7/what_is_the_strangest_way_you_found_out_a_friend/,What is the strangest way you found out a friend was wealthy?,"Here is my story which may sound like a movie.

So, this happened last year in mid-2024.

We were all 21 year olds Engineering Students doing our summer internship at a renowned tech company in Noida. There was a 21 year old girl with us in the same company, who was pursuing [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) in Computer Science from one of the top colleges in Delhi (One of it from IIITD, DTU and NSUT). She was brilliant-with exceptional Coding skills and Tech knowledge, and was very hardworking.

We were 5‚Äì6 students there from different colleges but we all quickly bonded well and became friends. That girl was pretty friendly, had a great sense of humour, smart and was very humble with everybody,  and was gorgeous. She looked to hail from a well to do but grounded family. If I go in little detail:

1. She used to dress very well but not flashy and had 3-4 pairs of shoes that she repeated alternatively. All were from brands like Puma and Adidas.
2. She used an iPhone 13 Pro Max-an almost 3 year old model then as it was launched in 2021, and had Airpods as well as a Macbook.
3. She had amazing communication skills and spoke fluent English with a mix of modern slang and impressed us all with her knowledge‚Äînot just in tech, but also in geo-politics, economics, and even Sanskrit. She often quoted the Bhagavad Gita and would explain deep philosophical meanings from it, and all of were very impressed as well as initially surprised. As I'm into spirituality too, we both used to have a good time discussing many aspects of this and I learnt a lot from her.
4. She was very respectful towards everyone and used to speak to the Senior Engineers or the peon/security guard with the same politeness.
5. She used to reside in Noida itself and come to the Office via Metro and E-rickshaw. First, she to used to board from a Metro station nearest to her home in Noida, come to the nearest metro station of Office and then take an E-rickshaw to reach the Office which was about 2-3 kilometres away from the Metro station.

In all, she seemed to come from an upper middle class family as per Delhi NCR standards-comfortable, but not ultra-rich. As many youngsters today own an iPhone (For example-I come from one such middle class family and myself owned an iPhone) and Airpods and branded Shoes, it was kind off ordinary and not something out of the World.

Days and weeks passed. After the working hours, we all (5‚Äì6 people) used to eat the street food like Golgappe (that she loved the most) and Momo together after the office hours and were having a good time. She didn‚Äôt seem to be different from us at all in terms of financial background.

Until one day.

It was the time of mid-August, and there was a sudden and heavy rain at the evening right after the working hours. We were all standing near the gate inside the Office premises chit-chatting and looking at the rain and waiting for it to stop, but it didn‚Äôt give any such signs.

15-20 minutes passed but still, it was raining heavily. 2 people booked cabs and left. We were 4 people left now, when I asked her plans about leaving. She said she would wait for another 10 minutes and if she still couldn‚Äôt find any E-rickshaw, then she will ‚Äúsee‚Äù. As it was raining heavily, there were no E-rickshaws nearby too. (She used to take an E-rickshaw to the Metro station daily.)

Neither the rain stopped nor she could find any E-rickshaw and 10 minutes passed. As I was observing her, she sent a text to somebody and right after a minute, got a call. She spoke something for 20 seconds or so and went near the gate and started walking back and forth there as she was waiting for someone.

We all went there too and started chit-chatting among ourselves when, after around 10 minutes- a really long, white Car with the windows tinted pulled up right in front of her. We could see a well dressed chauffeur inside and as we could even process what was happening, the chauffeur quickly came out towards her with an umbrella and opened the door for her.

The car was a Rolls Royce Ghost. Yes, a freaking Rolls Royce.

As we just stood there speechless, she smiled, said goodbye to all of us and quickly moved towards the Car, sat on the back seat and left while the driver closed her door gently, and returned to the driver's seat and the Car glided away.

For those who don‚Äôt know, that Car was worth over ‚Çπ7 Crore on-road and is one of the most expensive and the most luxurious sedans in the World.

We were pretty curious and asked her the other day whether it was her Car. And, it was only then when we came to know that:

1. Her Father was a multi-millionaire Businessman and she hailed from one of the most Wealthiest families of Noida (and all of Delhi NCR). She used to reside at a luxurious Mansion and had multiple Luxury cars including a Range Rover, a Porsche SUV as well as a Ferrari in her garage.
2. As I was not from Noida, I was not familiar at that time, but she lived in one of the most posh localities of Noida. (one of it from sector 26, sector 15A and sector 44-These 3 are the most posh sectors of Noida.)
3. She had visited over 20 Countries at the age of 21, and her Home had a huge library especially curated for her and had more than 200 books.
4. Her dad had gifted her a BMW on her 21st Birthday just a few months back, for her own drives in the City as she was fond of driving.
5. She came from an old-Money family which is wealthy since the 1960s. Though now defunct as they ventured into other Businesses with time, her great-grandfather and his brothers used to own one of the largest Sugar Mills in the 1960s and 70s and were among the Wealthiest men in North India in those times.

The most surprising part? She had never travelled in the Metro before the internship. She said that she just wanted to try it for once. She liked the experience, found it convenient and economical for the short distance (of 5-6 km), and decided to keep doing it. That‚Äôs how we all thought she was just like one of us.

Inspite of being ultra rich, she was really very humble all the time with not even 1% of arrogance anywhere, and everybody admired her and she seemed to be just perfect who made everybody smile. There was some brilliant glow on her face all the time.

She invited all of us to her Residence at the end of the Internship for a Lunch party and it was simply stunning and a next level experience. Huge bungalow, ultra lavish interiors, courteous and a very welcoming family, and a chef who cooked like a five-star hotel.

**P.S.**¬†She‚Äôs doing great in her career‚Äîgot placed in one of the topmost tier Tech company. We both recently met for a coffee in a south Delhi lounge and had a great time. I could see how happy she was in her job and in her life altogether, she told me how she plans to continue working in Tech and not join her Family Business as she thinks she doesn't have the knack for Entrepreneurship and Business.

So, this was my experience and the strangest way I found out a friend was super Wealthy. What's your story?",59,1747053505.0,delhi,23,0.89,False

For an example template, let's say we have a 15 year old Inkling male, had a fairly troublesome childhood, he is still quiet up to his more recent years but is somehow still bubbly and expressive despite his childhood. Pursues a music career as a guitarist in his pastime in a virtuoso-like band. His ink/hair (Or tentacles if you prefer.) is lime green and has pale skin.

1kkrdom,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1kkrdom/the_importance_of_sleep_in_the_quitting_process/,The Importance of Sleep in the Quitting Process (Food for Thought #11),"On average, we spend about one-third of our lives sleeping.

Despite many gurus pushing people to work more and sleep less, sleeping plays a crucial role in our physical health, mental and emotional stability, and overall wellbeing.

Numerous studies have shown that people who sleep more and get better quality sleep, sharpen their mental capacity, boost their immune system, recover faster, feel more energised, and are more productive in their day to day lives.

On the flip side, as the Journal of Clinical Medicine suggests, sleep deprivation can have a profoundly negative impact on physical and mental health, mood, and public safety. 

[(You can read the whole article here)](https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.9476)

So far so good‚Äîwe all get it: sleep is important.

But is it important in addiction recovery, too?

To answer your question, it's not just important‚Äîit's absolutely essential.

A healthy sleep schedule should be a necessary component of quitting plan. When we sleep well, we tend to feel better; we feel happier and more energised, all of which strengthens our ability to resist the urge to smoke. It's also well-known that withdrawal symptoms can be a real pain in the ass. Especially at first, when nicotine is removed from our system, we experience withdrawal symptoms‚Äîirritability, anxiety, stress, restlessness, anger, etc. Therefore, a good night's sleep can help counterbalance these negative emotions by making us feel more rested.

Another point I'd like to mention is that, when we're restless and haven't slept well, we're much more prone to taking bad decisions. Think about it:

If you're feeling tired and sleepy, you're more likely to lay around all day, watch TV, and binge-eat whatever junk food you can find. In this state, it's very easy to relapse and choose the path of least resistance‚Äîthe thing that's more convenient in the moment‚Äîand for a smoker, that's lighting up a cigarette.

To conclude, if you're considering quitting smoking, start from the basics‚Äîand one key basic is quality sleep. 

‚àö Aim to sleep at least 7-8 hours every night.

‚àö Have an evening routine that prepares you for a good night's sleep (I'll make a different post on this in the future).

‚àö Go to bed and wake up at approximately the same time every day.

‚àö Avoid stimulants before bed (coffee, energy drinks, etc.).

Start from the basics, and build on top of them.

1kkrc7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kkrc7v/dads_connections_killed_me/,"Dads ""connections"" killed me.","Whenever my family runs into the slightest inconvenience, it's solved in a heartbeat. 

Mom was fired from her job, only to be promoted to a higher position hours later. 

Grandpa had terminal brain cancer and was miraculously cured within a week. 

It's almost like my family had their own personal fairy godmother.

All Dad had to do was ring his friend Mike, who pulled strings that I never saw.

I used to joke that if Mike ever died, his funeral would be attended by a mysterious man standing under a black umbrella.

Dad said it was never *that* serious, though over the years I noticed Mike fixed *all* of our problems.

My brother got into his dream college without even trying. 

He didn't even graduate high school, yet somehow got into Harvard, thanks to Mike‚Äôs connections.

So, I chose not to even *try* in my first year of college, moving back home and getting a job at the mall. 

I wanted to be a photographer, not a doctor, which was what my father insisted on.

Mike *did* get me into a prestigious medical school, but I was scared of blood. I told him multiple times I wouldn't be able to stomach it.

Dad was pissed, sure, but he didn't say anything, allowing me to stay for the summer to sort my thoughts out.

He told me Mike could easily get me into another school abroad, but I kept telling him:

I didn't *want* to be a doctor.

That was Dad‚Äôs dream, not mine.

I did ask if he could get his *connections* to find me a summer job in photography, but Dad was adamant that both of his children were going to medical school. Which sucked.

I understood Dad wanted us to be successful, but I hated blood. The idea of slicing into a human body made me nauseous.

I mean, come on, I couldn't even handle horror movies.

My brother was training to be a surgeon. Somehow.

Which was weird, since just a year prior, he attempted to leave home with his girlfriend to pursue his passion.

I hadn't spoken to him in a while, but Dex  suddenly dropped his love for acting and dumped his girlfriend.

He and Elena were engaged, and he just *left* her like that.

Like he never even loved her.

I still remember the night before he ran away. Dex told me to do the same.

*There's something wrong with Mike,* my brother told me, sitting on my bed.

Dex had been suspicious of Mike since we were kids and our father‚Äôs friend had stopped us from getting sick. We had the stomach flu once during middle school and hadn't been sick since.

Which was crazy, right? Mom didn't seem fazed, and Dad insisted we just had *really* good immune systems.

Dex was convinced it was witchcraft.

I was skeptical, leaning more towards *Mike has connections.*

Suddenly, my brother was a completely different person.

I knew siblings grew apart when they left for college, but this was on a whole other level. 

Dex never answered my texts or calls, and when he did, he was either studying, in night classes, or with his smart-ass friends. 

Growing up was a given, I knew that. But Dex became a stranger I couldn't stand. He was a whole other boy who happened to wear my brother‚Äôs face.

Dex was too different at Thanksgiving dinner, too formal, like he'd been possessed by royalty, talking in depth about his classes and that he was the top-ranked student. That wasn't Dex.

I knew it wasn't my brother, because Dex hated being categorized. 

He also HATED Harvard. 

'Dream school' my ass. 

He could barely focus in school, his teachers insisting on him being screened for ADHD, which Dad refused. 

Because, in Dad‚Äôs eyes, we had to be perfect. 

I jokingly commented that Dex didn't even graduate high school, just to shut him up, and Dad almost choked on a mouthful of turkey. Mom pursed her lips around the rim of her wine glass. 

Dex hadn't spoken to me since, completely under our father‚Äôs spell. 

When we were kids, my brother left me little notes to reassure me that I was going to be okay. 

He'd hide them in sofa creases and slip them under my door. Except when I searched his room, there was nothing, only the ghost of who Dex used to be. 

His application for a drama school in New York was still on his dresser, crumpled under old movie posters and textbooks, covered in coffee stains. He'd only written his name.

I laughed at that. 

*That* was Dexter. Distracted by everything. 

It was 2am when Dad pulled me out of bed.

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù wiping sleep from my eyes, I blinked at him, confused. 

‚ÄúGet in the car,‚Äù Dad told me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going out.‚Äù

I didn't like the idea of going out at 2am, but sure, a father daughter car-ride sounded fun. 

Sliding onto cool leather seats, hesitantly, I was still wrapped in my blanket, still sleepy, my head pressed against the car window. 

It was freezing cold, I was shivering. When I was a little more awake, my mind drifting into fruition, a father daughter car ride was sounding progressively less appealing. 

I noticed Dad was driving us out of town, which was out of character. 

Dad hated going out of town. I couldn't help it, a shiver of panic slipping down my spine. I could feel my heart start to skip in my chest, my stomach twisting into uncomfortable knots. ‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù

He didn't reply, cranking the radio up, which left me to stew in the silence, and the sound of my heart pounding faster. 

Pressing my face against the glass, I blinked at the long, winding road, blanketed oblivion in front of me. 

We were in the middle of rural Virginia, and my phone was dead, so I couldn't even text Mom. 

I did have several locations in my head, though neither of them justified 2am. 

Couldn't Dad have waited until morning? 

The thought suddenly struck me. Was grandpa sick? 

The more I thought about it, the sicker I started to feel. I hated the dark, and it was the kind of dark that felt almost empty, hollow, like there was no ending and the road would continue forever. 

The dark has always felt suffocating to me, and being enveloped in pitch black open oblivion, I had a sudden, overwhelming urge to jump out of the car. 

There were no streetlights, and the further away we were driving from home, from safety, panic was starting to choke my throat. I couldn't breathe, suddenly, clasping my hands in my lap. 

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù I said, my voice a sharp whisper I couldn't help. ‚ÄúWhere are you taking me?‚Äù

When Dad didn't answer, only stepping on the gas, I kicked his seat. 

‚ÄúDad!‚Äù

Dad‚Äôs fingers tightened around the wheel. 

‚ÄúShopping,‚Äù was his only response. 

Shopping? My mind whirred with questions. 

At 2am?

When I leaned back in my seat, my  hands delving between the gaps by habit, I pulled out a folded piece of card. 

I thought it was trash, but peering at it, something was written in black ink. 

When a streetlight finally appeared, a sickly glow illuminating the note, I  found myself staring at a single word written in my brother‚Äôs old writing.

Dex‚Äôs handwriting had drastically changed. 

For example, on my recent birthday card, he signed his name in perfect calligraphy. 

But I knew his old writing, his scrappy scribbles that were hard to read, which was exactly what I was staring at, and it was unmistakable, something I couldn't ignore, even when I tried to push down that panic, that drowning feeling starting to envelop me. 

*RUN.*

My gaze flicked to the front. Luckily, Dad wasn't paying attention. 

‚ÄúShopping?‚Äù I said shakily, my hand pawing for the lock on the door. 

My  breaths were heavy, suddenly, suffocated in my chest, I couldn't trust them. I maintained a smile, but I felt like I was fucking drowning, Dex‚Äôs note grasped in my fist. Sliding across the seat, I tried the other door. Also locked. 

‚ÄúYeah. Shopping,‚Äù Dad hummed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre out of milk.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut there are no stores open.‚Äù I managed to choke out. 

I was all too aware of the car slowing down, and I was already planning my escape, my mind felt choked and wrong, and there were so many questions. If Dex had been on this exact car ride, then what happened to him? 

Mike was my top suspect. 

If Dad‚Äôs friend with connections could turn my brother into a stranger, then he could do anything to me. 

Weighing my options, I feverishly watched my father find a parking spot. 

I had to think straight. If I didn't, I was going to end up like Dex. I had a plan, sort of. If I dove over the front seat when my father wasn't looking, I would be able to get away. I had no plan for after that. I was just focusing on getting out of the car. 

However, when I was ready to leap over the seat, Dad stopped the car and jumped out. 

I tried to shuffle back, tried to inch toward the left door, but Dad was already grasping my arm and pulling me out of the car. 

In my panic, I dropped the note, stumbling out into cool air tickling my cheeks. The night should have felt like any other, and yet I was standing in the middle of nowhere. 

The sky above was too dark, and there were no stars. 

I was going to run, before I glimpsed building loomed in the distance. 

The place reminded me of a warehouse, or even a facility, a silver monolith cut off from the rest of the world. 

There was a lake nearby, and nothing else. 

Dad grabbed my hand gently, though his grasp was firm, a subtle order to stay by his side. 

He flashed his ID card at a guard, pulling me towards automatic doors lit up in eerie white light. 

My panic twisted into confusion, relief washing over me like warm water. Dad was right. It *was* a shopping centre. 

When we entered, and I found myself mesmerised by a labyrinth of aisles, we passed a section of canned food, and then snacks and medical supplies. 

Studying each aisle, I was in awe. Survival equipment, diapers, and a whole aisle dedicated to college textbooks.

What was this place? 

It was like a super Costco. 

When I reached for a cart, Dad kept pulling me further down each aisle, and the deeper I was dragged into this place, what was being sold started to contort in my vision, like I was in a nightmare. 

The lights above started to dim, the goods being sold twisting into things I didn't want to see. 

Stomach lining in vacuum packaging, and then a racoon skeleton. 

I was comforted by a section of whipping cream and baking soda, before we turned a corner, a sudden blur of twisted red slamming into me. 

It was all I could see, stretched straight down the aisle. 

I thought it was fish at first, fresh fish being sold early. 

Except each bulging mass of red my father and I passed was unmistakably human. 

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù I rasped, glimpsing a human heart sitting on display, encased in ice. 

‚ÄúWhat is this place?‚Äù 

I started to back away, but I couldn't stop staring. 

I found myself in a trance, following my father. 

It was like stepping into an emergency ward. I had been there once, and never again. I hated blood, and it was everywhere, smearing the floor and shelves.

I don't know if I was in shock, before reality started to hit me in what felt like electroshocks. 

There were body parts for sale, both dead and alive, human brains both separate, and being sold with their bodies. 

People. 

Normal people put on display, their skin marked with red pen highlighting specific parts of them. 

I saw women, their faces circled and marked with different prices. 

Men, covered in brightly coloured tags advertising features. 

Coming to a halt, my body wouldn't‚Ä¶ move. 

I couldn't fucking breathe. 

‚ÄúLily.‚Äù

Dad pulled me in front of one sign in particular. *Intelligence (17-25)*

I saw others. 

*Intelligence. 25-30*

*Intelligence. 30-40*

The advertisement showed a group of smiling teenagers mid-laugh.

Underneath: *‚ÄùGive your children the greatest gift ever!‚Äù*

I should have been glued to it, trying to figure out what *Intelligence* meant, except my gaze wasn't on the sign, or even my father, already forking out cash. 

I was dizzily aware I was taking steps back, but I couldn't bring myself to move, to twist around and run. 

We were too deep into the store, and the exit was so far away, a labyrinth I knew I wouldn't be able to get through without my legs giving way. 

The store owner greeted my father, and I had to breathe deeply to stay afloat. 

Dad introduced himself as a friend of Mike, though his voice didn't feel real, drifting in and out of reality. 

The display said *Intelligence*, but that didn't make sense.

A guy stood in front of me, with blondish-brown hair and wide, dilated pupils. 

He was dressed in a simple white shirt and shorts, looking almost high. 

Despite his eerie grin, I noticed he was trembling, his hands pinned behind his back. He stood perfectly straight, chin up, eyes forward, like a puppet on strings. It wasn't until my eyes found his forehead, where his IQ had been written in permanent marker, that I realized what the store was advertising. 

Then I found the subtle tube stuck into the back of his hand. 

Drugged. 

‚ÄúBen is our smartest!‚Äù the man gushed, like he was selling a car. 

‚ÄúHe was donated a few weeks ago. Apparently, he tried to kill himself! Who would have thought, right? A smart kid like that trying to end it! Anyway, he's been fully checked. The kid graduated early, attended Cambridge University in England, only to move back home and attempt suicide on Christmas Eve.‚Äù 

The stall owner's voice slammed into me like waves of ice water, and I remembered Dex‚Äôs sudden change in personality. 

Like he was a *different person.*

Something warm slithered up my throat, and I slapped my hand over my mouth. 

I couldn't take my eyes off of the *intelligence* being paraded in front of me.  

This nineteen year old boy with a crooked smile, freckles speckling his cheeks. 

This kid, who had a life, a family and friends, and a reason why he chose to die.

Reduced to an empty shell with a high IQ.

The owner gestured to the kid, who didn't even blink, didn't dare make eye contact with me. 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I said, and then I said it louder, twisting around.

I needed to get away. 

I needed to run. 

There were three guards in front of me. 

Following the store owner‚Äôs order to restrain me, they did, hesitant when my father barked at them not to hurt me. 

‚ÄúI can assure you, your daughter will have a sparkling career.‚Äù The stall owner was smiling widely, and I screamed, struggling violently. 

‚ÄúI'll take him,‚Äù Dad said, unfazed by my cries. ‚ÄúHow much is he?‚Äù

‚Äú950,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúSince my wife has done business with you before, consider it a discount.‚Äù 

He turned to the boy with a laugh. 

‚ÄúBen is a good boy, so the process should take about three hours. Usually, after the removal, the brain can go into shock and sometimes shut down due to trauma. It may take weeks, or even months, for it to fully settle into its new body.‚Äù

His smile widened, and I heaved up my meagre dinner, spewing all over the guard. 

When I screamed, my cries were muffled, suffocated, I felt like I was choking. I was going to fucking die. 

*I have to get out of here*, my thoughts were paralysed, fight or flight sending my body into a manic frenzy. 

I wanted to find comfort in the boy on sale. 

But he kept smiling, wider and wider, oblivious he was standing in a slaughterhouse. 

Ben didn't fight back when another guard grabbed him. 

Instead, he was like a doll cut from his puppet strings, limp and unresponsive. The man ripped the price tag off Ben‚Äôs cheek, and he didn't even flinch. 

‚ÄúIt's your lucky day, boy,‚Äù the guard chuckled. ‚ÄúYou're finally getting a body.""

Ben just smiled, swaying to the left, almost losing his balance. 

The store owner was still speaking, and I took the opportunity to headbutt a guard. 

He let go instantly, but I dropped to my knees, disoriented. 

I was free. But I didn't know where to go.

Everything was blurry, twisted and contorted red.

‚ÄúRun!‚Äù was all I could shriek at Ben, who didn't even blink.

‚ÄúHe can't hear you.‚Äù The store owner laughed, like it was funny. 

Like he was telling a fucking joke. 

‚ÄúIntelligence is shipped to us directly from conversion. All nice and packaged for sale. Everything else is gone, kid. You're talking to a blank slate.""

When I was yanked to my feet again, I felt numb.

‚ÄúHowever,‚Äù the owner rolled his eyes, ‚Äúlike I said, Ben wanted to die,‚Äù he chuckled. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm confident he won‚Äôt fight back. They usually don't, but if he does, you‚Äôre free to return him within thirty days, just like all our products. Oh, and don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthe mind has been wiped of personality. Only his IQ and achievements remain. The  core identity is removed during the conversion to avoid‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs call them complications.‚Äù

‚ÄúComplications?‚Äù Dad‚Äôs tone darkened. ‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, it's nothing to worry about! We have had instances of what we call *revival*, which is essentially, uh,‚Äù the store owner was stumbling over his words. ‚ÄúWell, what happens when you factory reset your iPhone?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt erases everything.‚Äù Dad said. 

The man nodded. ‚ÄúYes. However, in some rare instances, fragments can be left behind. In the case of the human brain, memories can cling on, and in rare occurrences, so can consciousness. Mr Charlotte, I‚Äôm not saying it will happen, but if you have any problems, feel free to bring him back and we will provide a full refund.‚Äù

Dad nodded slowly. ‚ÄúThen I'll take him.‚Äù

I stopped breathing, my body going still. 

Was this really happening? 

Was I going to die? 

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù I whispered, when my father cupped my cheeks and told me to be brave. 

He told me I was his strong little girl. I did try. I fucking tried to nod, like I was accepting it, before clawing his eyes out. 

I tried to use soothing tones, but they weren't working. 

I resorted to screaming at him. I told him he was dead to me, that he was a psychopath. I really thought it might wake him up, make him realize that I  was his daughter. 

I wasn't a caricature of what a successful daughter should be. 

I was his fucking daughter. 

‚ÄúDad!‚Äù 

Except he didn't listen, his hands tightening on my shoulders.

‚ÄúYou want to be smarter, don't you, Lily?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù an animalistic shriek ripped from my throat.

‚ÄúYes, you do.‚Äù He smiled through gritted teeth. ‚ÄúI'm going to make you smarter, all right? Just like your brother, sweetie.‚Äù

I tried to attack him, screeching like a wild animal. 

I did try to run, biting down on a guard‚Äôs hand. But it was my father pulling me back which brought reality crashing down. 

I was going to die. 

I stopped trying to get away, stopped crying, when I was picked up and thrown over a guard's shoulder. 

I remember being pinned down on an ice cold surface, a cruel prick in my neck numbing my limbs, and silver blades whirring above me. My arms and legs were restrained, my forehead marked with a cold red pen that tickled. 

I laughed, but my laughter exploded into hysterical sobs. 

Figures in blue scrubs surrounded me in a blur. 

They poked and prodded me, their voices collapsing into incomprehensible white noise. I slept for a while, dazed from the drugs feeding into my arms. 

I wasn't even aware of a cannula being forced into my wrist. The sound of a saw startled my numb thoughts, and I twisted my head, eyes flickering, lips trying to form words.

I remember everything was slow. 

Like I had been forced into slow motion. 

The back of my head had been shaved, and all of my hair was gone. 

The ice cold surface of the surgical table made me shiver. 

When the sound of the saw became unbearable, I gave up and forced myself to squint through a curtain of filthy plastic. 

There was a bed next to mine, pooling red seeping across the floor, a limp arm hanging over the edge. The hand was still moving, still clenching into a fist, like they could feel it, every cruel cut ripping them apart. I wondered who the boy was. 

I wondered what his life was like, and why he chose to end it.

*Why did you want to die, Ben?*

I squeezed my eyes shut as the saw continued. But morbid curiosity forced them open. I watched  numb, as blood pooled and ran black across the pristine white tiles, trickling through the gaps. 

There was so much of it. Ben, who never had a voice to scream with. 

Who had already been wiped away long before his brain was on sale. 

I could hear him being cut apart, and the sound drove me to the brink, teetering, and wanting to end it right there before a blade could slice into my skull. 

I tried to bite my tongue off. 

I tried to smash my head against the bed. 

But still, the saw grew louder, and I could sense it getting closer. 

Closer. 

Closer. 

When the boy‚Äôs hand finally went limp, I desperately tried to free myself from the table, but I was brutally restrained, my arms and legs tightly bound. 

The saw stopped, and a cleaner rushed in to deal with the blood. 

I could sense the figures in scrubs murmuring excitedly; they had exactly what they wanted, what my dad had bought him for. Vomit clung to my mouth, dripping down my chin. 

When I opened my eyes again, what was left of Ben was being wheeled away, leaving me alone in the cold, sterile room. 

For a brief moment, I found myself drowning in silence.

Silence.

It gave me hope.

Maybe Dad had a change of heart.

But then the screeching started up again.

Wait. The word didn‚Äôt make it to my lips. Instead, my body just froze, paralyzed.

‚ÄúMiss Charlotte, can you count down to ten, please?‚Äù

The voice in my ear was a low murmur, a woman‚Äôs voice with a hint of empathy.

‚ÄúOne.‚Äù I whispered over the whirring blades growing closer.

‚ÄúTwo.‚Äù

‚ÄúThree.‚Äù

‚ÄúFour.‚Äù

I heaved in a breath, sobbing.

‚ÄúFive.‚Äù

‚ÄúSix.‚Äù

‚ÄúSeven.‚Äù

The world went dark suddenly, and I panicked.

‚ÄúEight.‚Äù

The saw had stopped, and I was‚Ä¶ falling. Just like Alice, down the rabbit hole. 

But this was deeper than a rabbit hole. 

I don't think this darkness had an ending, or a *bottom*. 

‚ÄúNine.‚Äù I whispered, my words felt wrong and void. 

*‚ÄúTen.‚Äù*

When I opened my eyes, the scene in front of me had shifted. 

I was no longer restrained, but lying comfortably on a soft bed. The sterile room was gone, replaced by the warm light of morning filtering through a window. My father was smiling at me. 

‚ÄúLily!‚Äù He hugged me, and I hugged him back.

‚ÄúSweetie, you look beautiful.‚Äù

I took my father‚Äôs hand. The bandages around my head felt itchy and uncomfortable, but I kept smiling as I walked into the morning sunlight that burned my face. I hadn‚Äôt felt the sun on my face in so long, it was perfect. 

When my father took me home, I entered the kitchen with the intention of finding a bone saw.

Just like the one used to kill me.

The sharpest thing I  could find was a butcher knife. I sliced up that bastard when he was curled up in bed. I started with his head, hacking it off when he was half awake, half conscious. He should have been fully awake, like you were, Lily. 

He should have been able to feel everything. 

I'm glad your Mom was out, because then I'd have to kill her too. 

I'm sorry I took your body, Lily. 

And for the record, I didn't *want* to die. 

I was kidnapped and sold overseas by my psycho university professor. 

Fucking asshole. 

I didn't jump off a bridge on Christmas Eve either. I spent that night hiding from him and his goons trying to hunt me down. I was PUSHED off the bridge. 

They faked my death and shipped me here. 

Apparently, some billionaire fuck wanted my brain for his daughter, but he pulled out of the deal, so I ended up in the bargain bin with all of the left behinds. 

Suicide is the story they tell all of their customers so they feel better about murdering us. ‚ÄúOh no, don't worry, this one *wanted* to die, so he's completely fine!‚Äù

Fuck. I'm sorry I took your body, Lily.

I'm sorry your Dad is a piece of shit. 

And I'm sorry I burned your house to the ground. 

You didn't answer me for a while. I think you're still in shock. 

Your voice is soothing, and it feels comfortable. Like we‚Äôre one. You're getting louder, and if I concentrate, it almost feels like I can feel your breath tickling my ear. 

*‚ÄùIt's okay, Ben!‚Äù* Your response almost feels like a goodbye. I hope it isn't. 

*‚ÄùI'm sorry my Dad has connections.‚Äù*",23,1747053155.0,stories,5,1.0,False

1kkra1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1kkra1l/girl_got_attached_after_only_one_meeting/,Girl got attached after only one meeting,"Hey Reddit friends, I need some advice. 

Here's the situation: I am 29M. I connected with this 25F girl on JS in late December, around New Year's. We both happened to be from the same hometown, so we decided to meet up. We had a coffee, had street food and spent some time together. After a couple of conversations on chat and phone, I felt she wasn‚Äôt quite the right match for me. She was 25 years old and seemed a bit immature in certain areas that might affect a long-term relationship. Our thoughts didn‚Äôt align. During this whole time, I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong or tried to flirt or love bomb or anything to make her feel something special. 

We stayed in touch through chat, but I wasn't very interested and didn‚Äôt put much effort into it. After about 2-3 weeks, I told her politely that we might not be the right match and explained my reasons. This was around mid-January.

Fast forward to February-March, I removed her from Instagram since we weren‚Äôt friends or in touch anymore. 

In May, she sent me a request on Instagram. I accepted it, thinking it was fine to stay connected after a few months.

Last night, I got an irritating message from her. She asked what was wrong with her and said she was putting in effort but felt disrespected because I was reciprocating in the same way. She mentioned getting many proposals but she is feeling stuck with me because she thought I might come back or she should not waste herself on someone because I might be waiting. She sent 14-15 messages back-to-back on Instagram.

As a first thing - I apologized for making her feel this way and what happened. I suggested we talk over the phone today. 

I'm unsure how to navigate this and explain that I‚Äôm not interested without making her feel bad. Honestly, I don‚Äôt think I did anything wrong.

I need your guidance on how to handle this situation. I don‚Äôt know if I should share screenshots for more context, not sure if that's appropriate for privacy reasons, but this is the gist of it. 

Your thoughts and help would be appreciated!",9,1747052980.0,Arrangedmarriage,18,0.91,False
1kkr8q3,https://i.redd.it/g0u8k2naxb0f1.jpeg,Hallway and Boy might have been for SOTM,"Anyone else remember this [""Hallway and Boy"" artwork by LadyFiszi](https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/qshxu2/hallway_and_boy/)? Years later, we still do not know what it was for. I think it was made for SOTM. In Dawko's recent interview with Steel Wool, Evan Lampi says ""Scott, really early on, sent us key art that he had worked on with his artist that showcase these creepy hallways and stuff, and he said 'this is kind of the tone that I want from this game.'"" This statement seems to describe Hallway and Boy pretty well:

* ""really early on"": this was posted in November of 2021. Later in the interview, Evan says that Steel Wool first started working on SOTM in early 2022. Perhaps they received this artwork as they were busy working on SB, then after the holidays, they started working on SOTM. This timeline sounds plausible to me, as the publication date of Hallway and Boy is really close to when Evan says they started working on SOTM.
* ""with his artist"": LadyFiszi used to be one of Scott's official artists for a long time
* ""creepy hallways"": this is a creepy hallway

More evidence:

* This was published one day after [this artwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/qrq1vk/creepyfriendly_faces/) showing fabric costumes of the Fazbear gang. SOTM takes place in a costume workshop so it's probably where these costumes are from. However, Chica seems to have an endoskeleton so this might not work as evidence.
* 70s colors: the walls are a 70s green and the light fixture is a 70s orange. SOTM has a 70s aesthetic.
* The moon: The DCA is a prominent character in Security Breach, and judging by how his teeth match the Mimic's in Ruin as well as his association with the carousel in HW2, he is probably really old and could make an appearance in SOTM. The clock could be a reference to him.
* Lack of alternative explanations. We still have no idea what this artwork is for, and SOTM is one of the biggest and most mysterious upcoming projects for the series, so it feels intuitive that this would be for SOTM. Also, we have never seen this location or this character before, and a lot of other projects (like DBD, Five Laps, and the Ephemera Kit) are about celebrating stuff we already know about. The YouTuber Ozone theorized that this image was about the Tales from the Pizzaplex series, but I doubt it because the connections are a little weak and I find it more likely that Scott would commission reference art for a video game as opposed to a book because a video game is a visual medium.

Ok, so what is going on in the hallway?

* LadyFiszi commented on one detail. There is a circus ringmaster figure on the dresser. LadyFiszi said it was based on something she saw at a pawn shop. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/10g388c/comment/j509lxg/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/10g388c/comment/j509lxg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
* This feels more like a house than Edwin's factory. The factory has brick walls and concrete floors, but this has hardwood floors and paneled walls. Looking at the SOTM trailer, it could be part of MCM, but it looks more like a regular house to me.
* There is a clock that looks like Moon. Maybe he will make a reappearance in SOTM.
* There are 3 umbrellas so 3 people probably live here.
* There are some details that remind me of the Aftons
   * A painting that looks like Ballora
   * A painting of a fox
   * A taxidermy rabbit
   * A rosy cheeked baby doll
* There is a woman's hat so a woman probably lives here or used to live here
* Flowers
   * White lilies. These are often used at funerals or are received when someone dies.
   * Roses.
   * Reminds me of FNAF 4. Also Phineas Taggart explains how flowers have supernatural power in FNAF.
* Messes
   * Broken coffee cup. Shattered, if you will... 
   * Pillow on the floor
* Other details that don't mean much to me
   * Horse painting
   * Skunk
   * Duck
   * Mirror
   * etc

And the boy?

* Maybe he's David's ghost lmaoooooooo. ""The Mimic"" short story opens up with the line ""Daddy, I'm a ghost!"" and David pretends to be a ghost so maybe it's foreshadowing. His hair is described similar to the image as a ""badly cut thatch of fine brown hair."" The boy is also colored in grey as FNAF ghosts are often depicted.
* The Crying Child. Some people have been theorizing that BV will be in SOTM because of the Guess the Sketches.
* Young Michael. This could connect to the Afton related imagery in the hallway. He would also be about as old as the boy in the picture in 1979. Also if his story crosses paths with the Mimic ever, that could explain his room in SB, which currently has no good explanation.

1kkr8a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifts/comments/1kkr8a0/my_uncles_50th_birthday_party/,My uncle's 50th birthday party,"Hello everyone. Looking for a not very expensive gift for my uncle's birthday this coming weekend. He's invited us and some of his friends (who also have kids, although he doesn't) to brunch at a restaurant. I'm not sure if gifts are expected, but I figure he won't be upset to get something nice.

Info:

* He likes food and has recently gotten into cooking. He fancies himself quite a good cook and our family thinks its hilarious because all the great-aunts etc. are *actually* good cooks.
* He's very into classical music, to the point of snobbery. Something about sound systems. He tried to get me into ACDC and some other rock when I was younger, to no avail.
* He works in finance and has (in my opinion) terrible fashion sense.
* He's into coffee- I have seen him leave a social gathering with no announcement simply because he saw a cafe doing pour overs and return saying ""you can really taste the beans.""
* He does not read books, although he used to when younger. His partner jokes that he only reads headlines.
* He gives terrible presents himself (e.g. we don't use tech/screens with our children and for my son's birthday, my uncle gifted a toy remote).
* He loves to troll on the family group chats and is a delight to tease. But he can be a bit of a baby.





My husband, in his own sense of humor, has suggested a thousand piece puzzle ""to keep him busy."" I am not sure if my uncle will 1) either see this as the gag it is or 2) enjoy it. What are your suggestions, wise reddit?

First of all, hearing from a close relative, ""Bat ka pa boboto, 'di ka naman bibigyan ng pera ng mga yan."" Election is not about money. Maybe they cannot give me money because they was supposed to give us more than just money. I believe that a right candidates can do many things, not for me personally, but for our country.

Secondly I think we really should not look at candidates as a rooster in a cockfighting match. They are not contestant that we vote to make bets on, we should not support them as if they were gods or as if we are allied of those who we vote for. We are not their allies, we are Filipinos, we must not let any political party or any candidate take over our citizenship. Who we vote for or support is not a flag that we should wave in pride; instead why don't we try acting as is we are a hiring manager looking for the 'best' person for the job? Some voters do not even know the duty and responsibilities of senators, how can they even be able to pick the best fit for the position. We are not a fan or a supporter we are Filipino citizen who must be a critical voter.

And lastly, I stand firm on this. To vote is a responsibility, and it is not optional. Why do some treat voting as if it was a creamer for a coffee---optional. As a citizen of this nation, you have a right to vote and it is your responsibility to excercise that right. Your vote matters! One vote matter! It same as the saying ""hindi mabubuo ang isang libo kung walang piso,"" so please do vote, even if it is hard, even it seems like there was no good fit for the postion, make some effort to put yourself out there, do some research and vote for the right person.

As a qoute from director Kip Oebanda says: Election is a one big joke which we must take seriously. 

Maraming bumoboto nang walang pake, maraming bumoboto para sa manok nila, pero¬†¬† sana marami ring bumoto nang marunong at may baong talino, sana marami pa ring bumoto para sa Pilipinas at hindi para sa kandidato.¬†¬†

I wiped away the last tear and said calmly, ""I am willing to marry you.""

Isabella had known Dominic for ten years. And she had fallen hard for him at first sight.

It was at the opening ceremony of their first year of high school. Dominic stood at the podium as the student representative.

Sunlight filtered through the hall's floor-to-ceiling windows, casting a golden halo around his sharply defined profile.

Girls throughout the auditorium whispered excitedly as they snuck photos.

But Isabella just stood in the shadows at the back of the hall.

Back then, Dominic was the golden boy of the high school.

Always top of his class, winning gold medals in competitions, even the way he rolled up his sleeves playing basketball exuded that subtle hint of cedar cologne‚Äîevery gesture screaming old money and privilege.

She was different worlds apart from him, just an ordinary scholarship student.

And this boy that every girl in school worshipped? His eyes only ever followed one person.

Chloe Winslow, his childhood sweetheart.

Isabella had witnessed him organizing Chloe's notes in the library, seen him drape his jacket over Chloe when she got caught in the rain, watched him search the entire city for a limited-edition CD Chloe had casually mentioned.

Later, she heard their families were old friends with an arranged marriage in the works.

Then came the summer after graduation, news broke that the Hinton Group had collapsed overnight.

The same Mr. Hinton who once drove a Rolls-Royce to parent-teacher conferences had jumped from the Hinton tower.

The next day, Chloe flew off to France.

Dominic was left alone to shoulder the immense debt, working tirelessly every day to repay it. His life became a blur of exhaustion and despair.

That night, Isabella found Dominic passed out drunk in an alley behind a bar.

His expensive shirt was wrinkled and his eyes bloodshot‚Äîlike an abandoned dog.

She crouched down to help him. But he grabbed her wrist, the stench of alcohol and blood hitting her face.

""Who are you?""

""Isabella Bennett,"" she whispered. ""We go to the same school. You probably don't remember...""

He didn't remember at all.

But he let her take him home anyway.

That night, Dominic was like a feral animal. He pinned her to the narrow bed in her tiny studio apartment and kissed her until her lips went numb.

Later, she knew that just thirty minutes before she found him, Chloe had updated her Instagram‚Äî

A photo showing her kissing her new boyfriend beneath the Eiffel Tower.

The next morning, Dominic offered to take responsibility for her.

Eventually, he moved into her cramped 200-square-foot studio. They held each other for warmth, surviving the toughest days together.

But Isabella knew, even though she'd rescued this fallen prince, his heart was never truly hers.

He never forgot Chloe.

She'd caught him staring at Chloe's photos in the middle of the night, watched him eat nothing but sandwich for three straight months to save for a plane ticket to Paris, seen him rush out the door on her birthday after receiving a text from Chloe.

Yet she remained hopelessly devoted.

She stayed up with him revising his resume, accompanied him as he dropped off job applications door-to-door, faced off with debt collectors.

During their toughest times, she secretly sold the only gold ring her mother had left her, just to buy him a decent suit for interviews.

Eventually, he started remembering she liked sugar in her coffee. He would text her to remind her to eat dinner while she worked late and gently drape a coat over her when she fell asleep.

She thought she'd finally thawed his frozen heart.

Meanwhile, he rose from the ashes, becoming once again the darling prince of high society.

Just when everything seemed to be heading in the right direction, Chloe returned from France.

And everything went back to square one.

He'd race his car to the airport at midnight to pick her up.

He‚Äôd throw a welcome-back party for her like nothing ever happened.

And the moment he heard she was getting married? He dropped everything to crash it without hesitation.

Seven years Isabella had given him everything, and still it couldn't compete with Chloe's simple ""I'm back.""

Finally, she was exhausted. Her love had run dry.

Isabella stood up and started packing.

One by one, everything went into garbage bags.

The garbage truck happened to pull up just then. She watched as workers tossed her bags onto the truck‚Äîalong with seven years of foolish dreams.

""What are you throwing away?""

The front door suddenly swung open, and Dominic's voice came from behind her.

Isabella didn't turn around, her voice eerily calm. ""Just some useless stuff.‚Äù

Then she looked up at him. ""Just cleaning the house. Got rid of things that didn‚Äôt matter anymore.‚Äù

Those few simple words made Dominic's expression change instantly. He shoved her aside and charged into the house.

""Who gave you permission to touch my things?!""

He ransacked the place, his face growing darker by the second.

After tearing apart the entire study without finding what he was looking for, he bolted outside.

As they passed each other, Dominic accidentally knocked Isabella down.

She stumbled, smashing her forehead against the doorframe. Blood immediately streamed down her face.

Worried he'd lost something important, she didn't even stop to treat her wound before rushing after him.

Then she witnessed the most absurd scene of her life‚Äî

Dominic Hinton, the same man with severe germaphobia‚Äîwas on his knees in a pile of garbage, frantically digging through garbage.

Seeing his desperation, guilt welled up inside her.

‚ÄúThe garbage truck already took everything. It‚Äôs at the dump by now. I swear, it was all mine‚ÄîI probably mixed in some of your stuff by accident. I‚Äôm... I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

Only then did Dominic notice her injury.

He froze and reached toward her face, then pulled back. ""I was in a hurry. I didn‚Äôt mean to.""

Once they were both in the car, Isabella finally asked. ""What did you lose? Was it important?""

Dominic gripped the steering wheel tightly. He was quiet for a long time.

‚ÄúIt was a necklace. I used to send it out for cleaning every month.‚Äù

Isabella‚Äôs breath caught, tears welling in her eyes.

That necklace was the token Dominic and Chloe had exchanged when they got engaged.

No wonder he was so desperate.

The tension inside the car thickened into silence.

Dominic noticed her shift in mood. He knewthere was no hiding the wedding incident from her, so he offered a half-hearted explanation.

""Before Chloe's grandfather died, I promised him I'd look after her. You know Lucas Montgomery. If Chloe married him, her life would be ruined. That's why I had to stop the wedding.""

These were just empty excuses to pacify Isabella.

The real reason he crashed the wedding was because he still had feelings for Chloe and couldn't stand watching her marry someone else.

And his desperate search for that necklace, a token that hadn‚Äôt meant anything legally for years‚Äîwas because deep down, he believed he should be the one marrying Chloe.

The thought twisted something sharp inside Isabella.

She turned her face toward the window, letting the tears fall silently.

""Well, Lucas has found someone new. He won't be bothering Chloe anymore. You can relax.""

Hearing her confident tone, Dominic's brow furrowed. ‚ÄúLucas found someone new? Who told you that?‚Äù

Isabella was about to tell him that she was the bride.

But just then, his jarring ringtone cut through the car.

The moment he answered, Chloe's sob came through the line.

""Dominic, my parents are furious I ran off. They're making me kneel and threatening corporal punishment. I‚Äôm gonna die in there! What should I do?""

""I'm coming right now!"" he barked.

He hung up quickly and turned to Isabella. ""Isabella, something's come up. Can you go look for the necklace first?""

Isabella opened her mouth, but no sound came out.

She nodded silently. Then she opened the car door and stepped out alone.

After watching his car disappear into the darkness, she hailed a Uber to the dump.

The garbage truck had already emptied its load. Looking at mountains of garbage under the dim lights, she rolled up her sleeves.

Fighting through the stench, she spent five grueling hours before finding her discarded things.

After turning every box upside down, she still couldn't find the necklace.

Then the housekeeper called.

""Miss Bennett, we found the necklace. It was under Mr. Hinton's pillow. Must‚Äôve slipped there while he was sleeping.‚Äù

Isabella let out a bitter laugh.

How deep must his love be to sleep with that necklace, holding onto memories even in his dreams?

And they'd shared that same bed every night, yet she'd never noticed.

Night had fallen completely. With no taxis in the remote area, she had to walk home.

Dawn was breaking, her feet bloodied and legs swollen, when she finally reached the house.

She'd left in such a hurry she'd forgotten her keys. Too tired to even knock, she leaned against the door and passed out.

Some time later, Isabella was awakened by someone.

Still groggy, she opened her eyes to see Dominic's assistant standing over her. He was clearly anxious.

""Miss Bennett, Mr. Hinton is in trouble. Please come to the hospital right away!""

Isabella's mind was foggy, unable to process what was happening before being pulled into a car.

The cold autumn wind brought her back to her senses, and she finally thought to ask what had happened.

The assistant looked uneasy, hesitating before pulling out his phone to show her a video.

""Mr. Hinton went to the Winslow estate yesterday. He offered to take Miss Winslow's punishment. They gave him one hundred lashes. He passed out afterward and was taken to the hospital.""

In the video, Isabella watched as the man who once would rather lose a hand to loan sharks than drop to his knees‚Äîwas now on his knees before Chloe's parents, taking the punishment meant for her.

Blood soaked through his shirt, wounds crisscrossed and torn open.

Each strike of the whip seemed to land on Isabella‚Äôs , leaving her gasping for air.

The assistant parked the car and escorted her to the hospital room.",1,1747052359.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

1kkr1ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kkr1ia/what_makes_the_blackdecker_cm618_the_ultimate/,What makes the BLACK+DECKER CM618 the ultimate single-serve coffee maker review?,"Testing out kitchen gadgets, especially coffee makers, is practically second nature to me, and I had the opportunity to put the BLACK+DECKER CM618 Single Serve Coffee Maker through its paces. Since mornings aren‚Äôt complete without a cup of coffee, I decided to see if this compact coffeemaker could keep up with my caffeine habit‚Äîor if it would fizzle out under the pressure. It holds promise with features like a compact design, reusable filter, and travel mug compatibility, but as always, there are small details worth discussing.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about this coffee maker was its size. It‚Äôs small‚Äîmeasuring just 5.47""D x 6.14""W x 9.41""H‚Äîwhich means it fits practically anywhere. My apartment kitchen is already tight on counter space, yet this little machine slid right in next to my toaster without any fuss. Its black plastic finish looks modern enough, though it‚Äôs not going to scream ‚Äúluxury.‚Äù For a utilitarian appliance, it does its job without being gaudy. The included 16-ounce travel mug is a nice addition and fits most car cup holders snugly. My morning commute is just a little easier when I can brew straight into the mug and hit the road without transferring coffee or risking spills mid-pour.  

[Ready for BLACK+DECKER CM618? Amazon might have a deal.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b008ys1wxe/)  

**Ease of Use**  
What really sold me initially was how simple it is to operate. There‚Äôs no tricky interface‚Äîjust a single button. You hit it, and the coffee brews. It‚Äôs as straightforward as it gets, perfect for groggy early mornings when my brain is still rebooting. The permanent grounds filter meant I didn‚Äôt need to stock up on disposable filters, which is both economical and environmentally friendly. Cleaning is a breeze too. The filter basket is removable, and a quick rinse in the sink is usually all it takes to have it fresh and ready for the next use.  

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
This coffee maker gets points for heating water to an optimal brewing temperature, ensuring the coffee doesn‚Äôt come out tasting like dishwater. It brews directly into the included travel mug, which I‚Äôve found keeps my coffee warm for a decent amount of time. Flavor-wise, it‚Äôs surprisingly good for something so compact. Of course, it doesn‚Äôt compare to a high-end espresso machine or a pour-over setup, but for a single-serve, drip-style cup of coffee, it punches above its weight. Even pre-ground coffee comes out tasting fresh and balanced.  

**Who Is This For?**  
I‚Äôd say this coffeemaker is designed with students, busy professionals, or anyone who lives alone in mind. Its one-mug philosophy works perfectly for people who don‚Äôt need or want a full pot of coffee and prefer a quick, no-nonsense brew. This machine is also great for travelers or those living in dorms, as its lightweight build and compact design make it portable and unobtrusive.  

**Highlights**  
- Compact design perfect for small spaces like dorms or tiny kitchens.  
- Includes a convenient 16-ounce travel mug, ideal for commuters.  
- Comes with a reusable filter, reducing waste and saving money over time.  
- Hassle-free, one-touch operation makes it beginner-friendly.  

**Shortcomings**  
While this coffeemaker has a lot to love, it does come with a few quirks worth mentioning:  
- The build, although compact, feels a bit lightweight and less sturdy compared to higher-end models.  
- The 16-ounce capacity might not suit heavy coffee drinkers who want multiple cups at once.  
- The black plastic finish, while sleek, isn‚Äôt the most durable long-term.

**Competitive Options**  
In the crowded world of compact coffee makers, there are a few rivals worth considering. For instance, the Keurig K-Mini offers similar portability but relies on K-cups instead of reusable filters, making it slightly less eco-friendly (though arguably more convenient for some users). The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew also competes well, as it allows greater flexibility between pods and grounds, but it‚Äôs bulkier in design. The BLACK+DECKER CM618, however, excels in simplicity and affordability, particularly for budget-conscious buyers willing to sacrifice a bit of aesthetic appeal for practicality.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
When you compare this model to others in its price range, it‚Äôs an impressive contender. Sure, it skips out on fancy features like digital displays or preset brew strengths, but that simplicity keeps costs low while still delivering a functional, reliable product. If the goal is to have a compact, single-serve coffee maker without breaking the bank, this fits the bill perfectly. While it doesn‚Äôt cater to coffee snobs looking for artisanal brewing methods, it‚Äôs an excellent option for people looking for convenience and usability.

Using the Elite Gourmet EGC115B Easy Egg Cooker has become a consistent part of my morning routine. From the first use, the convenience and simplicity of this egg cooker stood out to me, and I‚Äôve enjoyed testing its features. Though small in size, it delivers on its promise, preparing eggs quickly and effortlessly. I'll break down my experiences to help anyone curious about adding this kitchen gadget to their lineup.

**Design and Build: Compact and Practical**

The first thing that struck me about the Easy Egg Cooker was its compact size. The lightweight plastic body with its sleek black finish fits perfectly into my small kitchen without taking up too much counter space. For someone who doesn‚Äôt like clutter, this was a big win. Its dimensions, just 6.25"" x 6.25"" x 5.75"", make it super easy to slide into a drawer or display on the counter without being obtrusive. The transparent lid adds a stylish touch while allowing you to watch your eggs cook, even if it feels a bit thin. Overall, it‚Äôs both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

**Ease of Use: Straightforward and Family-Friendly**

I‚Äôll admit I was a little hesitant when I first unpacked it. Would it really be as simple as advertised? Spoiler alert: it is. Using the pre-marked measuring cup, I just fill it with the right amount of water depending on if I want soft, medium, or hard-boiled eggs, pour it onto the heating plate, add eggs, and press a button. That‚Äôs it! The auto shut-off function is genius; it makes cooking foolproof, even if you‚Äôre distracted by other kitchen tasks (or in my case, a barking dog).

[Check Elite Gourmet EGC115B price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0c5hrjhgl/)

**Cooking Results: Perfect Eggs Every Time**

This egg cooker can handle up to seven eggs at once. I tested all levels of doneness, and I‚Äôm happy to report that soft, medium, and hard-boiled eggs all turned out perfectly consistent. The shells peeled off effortlessly, which is always a struggle for me with stovetop boiling. The included piercing pin works to ensure no cracked eggs and vibrant yolks. I also tested the steaming function for vegetables‚Äîit works decently but isn‚Äôt as quick as other dedicated steamers I‚Äôve used. That said, it‚Äôs valuable having that versatility.

**Positives**

- Convenience for busy mornings  
- Compact and lightweight design  
- Cooks seven eggs at a time  
- Simple and foolproof operation with a measuring cup  
- Auto shut-off prevents overcooking  

**Flaws**

- Lid feels a little fragile  
- Steaming performance for veggies could be improved  
- Limited capacity for larger households  

**Performance and Time-Saving:**  

Compared to boiling eggs on the stovetop, this product is a lifesaver. I timed how long it took to make hard-boiled eggs: around 10 minutes. At the same time, I could get my morning coffee ready without worrying about overcooking. The measuring cup is precise, so there‚Äôs no guesswork involved. However, this isn‚Äôt the most silent appliance I‚Äôve used‚Äîit emits a slight whistling sound when heating, which might bother light sleepers.

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  

Cleanup is quick and hassle-free. Since the parts that come in contact with food‚Äîlike the tray and lid‚Äîare dishwasher safe, I usually toss them into the dishwasher. For the heating plate, a simple wipe with a damp cloth is sufficient if residue appears. It‚Äôs less effort than scrubbing a big saucepan after boiling eggs, that‚Äôs for sure.

**Use Cases and Who It's Perfect For**

If you‚Äôre someone juggling busy mornings, this product was practically designed for you. College students, single folks, or families who enjoy boiled eggs will appreciate how much simpler this makes breakfast prep. Given its small size, I can see it being ideal for apartments or dorm rooms where counter space is premium. However, families of four or more might find the seven-egg capacity limiting‚Äîthough you can always cook in batches.

**Competitive Options**

I've used other egg cookers before, such as the Dash Rapid Egg Cooker, which offers similar features. The Dash model has an edge in terms of color variety and a slightly faster cook time, but I found its build quality less durable than this one. Another competitor, the Cuisinart Egg Central, offers larger capacity but takes up considerably more counter space. For its balance of size, features, and effectiveness, the Elite Gourmet product holds its ground well.

**Quality for Price**

Given the product‚Äôs usefulness and time-saving potential, this egg cooker feels worth the price. You‚Äôre investing in simplicity, especially when comparing it to stovetop egg boiling or pricier competing models. It‚Äôs not a gadget for advanced chefs, but it brings value to daily life. Spending a few bucks to save time and ensure consistently good eggs feels like a smart buy in my book.

Just comment and I‚Äôll provide the link.","Ten years ago, he put a knife to his neck and announced to his parents that he would marry only me.  
Ten years later, he took up the knife again just to force me to apologize to his mistress.  
The boy who had sworn never to betray was now protecting another woman.  
It wasn't until then that I realized ten years of marriage had come to an end.  
‚ÄúLet's end this.‚Äù

""I don‚Äôt agree with the divorce!""

Thane rejected my request without a second thought.

He frowned slightly, glancing down at Lily, who he still held protectively in his arms. Seeming to realize something, he slowly released her. But he kept her safely behind him, guarding her as if I might hurt her.

The knife he gripped in his hand‚Äîits tip remained pointed at me, cold and cutting.

""Sophie, I promise you, Lily won't affect your standing at all.""

After a pause, he continued: ""But you must promise me you won't cause any more trouble for her.""

The ""trouble"" Thane referred to?

Just like‚Äîthe clear, humiliating handprint now visible on Lily's face.

If Thane had arrived any later, I might have grabbed Lily's hair and smashed her face against the coffee table, using the shattered glass from the broken water cup to cut up her face and hands, ensuring she'd never show herself to me again.

Insane and vicious thoughts.

But I used to be a person with stable emotions. For years, I rarely argued with anyone, let alone fought physically.

Acting so recklessly, lashing out like this‚Äîwas unprecedented for me.

I looked back at my two children, hiding in the bedroom but stubbornly peeking through a crack in the door‚Äîmy Emma and Noah.

Their faces still showed visible pinch marks, all thanks to Lily. So I couldn't control myself to hit her.

Thane was clearly shocked by my behavior. The young woman he'd been spoiling for over a year now covered her swollen face, crying to him about my cruelty.

And that boy who once promised never to let me down?

With fury in his eyes, ignoring our children's cries, he grabbed the knife from the counter when I tried to lunge at her again. He pressed it against my throat, demanding I calm down.

Yet once before, he had pressed that same knife to his own throat, telling his parents he would marry no one but me. That's how we got married, had our lovely children, and completed our family.

Unfortunately, both things and people have all changed.

""Sophie, we've been married for ten years. Our lives are too intertwined. Even if we die, we must die together, understand?""

Thane's eyes were determined as he spoke, completely missing Lily's resentful gaze.

She wanted my place‚Äîotherwise, this year-long affair, hidden so carefully by Thane, protected by my absolute trust in him, I should never have discovered it.

But Lily deliberately sought me out.

This girl whom Thane and I had jointly supported through school showed up boldly at my door with photo after photo of herself with Thane.

""Sophie, I'm grateful to you and Thane for supporting my education.""

""But let's be clear: gratitude is one thing, love is another.""

""So this doesn't mean I have to give Thane back to you.""

""I know you and Thane have been married for years, but you're older now, no longer fresh.""

""I'm just twenty‚Äîyoung and beautiful. What do you have to compete with me?""

""You guys probably don't even do it more than once a month, right?""

""But do you know what?""

""When Thane's with me, we do it every night.""

""He says he can't resist me.""

""Sophie, does Thane still feel that way about you?""

‚Ä¶

Every word cut through me like a knife.

That day was the most devastating of my entire life that I can't bear to remember it anymore.

So I just looked at Thane and repeated my earlier words.

""Thane, let's set each other free, okay?""

At that moment‚Äîoutside, ice cream truck is blaring its jingle in the sweltering heat.

In a daze, I remembered that summer when I was sixteen with the same suffocating heat and the same ice cream truck.

That day, Thane Cole, a transfer student, caught my attention when our teacher introduced him to the class.

Sunlight streamed through the windows, a gentle breeze lifted the edges of his crisp white shirt‚Äîit's a heart-pounding moment at first sight.

As class pre//sident, it was my responsibility to help new students get familiar with our class. So we had a reason to interact.

Back then, I only knew he was Thane Cole and came from New York City, with his family probably well-off. Maybe he was too rebellious, or maybe he'd done something wrong, and that's why he'd been sent to our small town.

But I didn't care about any of that. I just knew I needed to follow the teacher's instructions and help him integrate into our class.

Of course, I had my own little secret thoughts too‚Äîhe was simply too charming.

I've never claimed to be particularly deep. I've always paid extra attention to beautiful people and things.

Maybe it's just fate? Thane and I sat next to each other for three years, gradually evolving from slightly awkward classmates to best friends who shared everything. And then those occasional moments when our eyes met‚Äî

I felt my heart race, saw the tips of his ears turn red, and something unspoken grew between us.

A tacitly understanding, you could say.

After graduation, he presented me with my favorite lilies and asked if I dared to be his classmate for another four years.

I, Sophie Sutton, had never been afraid of anything. Four more years as classmates? Why would I be afraid of that?

So that summer, we applied to the same college and moved to the same unfamiliar city.

I think‚Ä¶ I have found love.

Those four college years were peaceful and happy. We never let go of each other's hands.

Until graduation day, a wealthy, bejeweled woman approached me. She introduced herself as Thane's mother, making it clear she looked down on me, explaining how the Cole family was enormously wealthy and influential. So when selecting a daughter-in-law, they had to be extremely careful.

Social compatibility was paramount. A plain girl from a small town like me shouldn't try to change her social status through marriage, dreaming of an overnight ascension.

Just like in the TV dramas, she pushed a blank check toward me, grandly telling me to fill in any amount I wanted.

But unlike the TV dramas, I didn't even have time to react. Thane, having heard about the meeting, rushed over.

That check I hadn't even properly seen?

It scattered into the air like confetti before my eyes.

That day, Thane held my hand so tightly, as if afraid I might waver, repeatedly telling me:

""Sophie, a check doesn't amount to much. As long as you don't let go of my hand, I'll give you anything you want.""

At that time, all I could think was‚Äî

Thane, I don't want your money. I only want your wholehearted love.

We were young and passionate then, believing love was everything and Thane was my everything.

It wasn't until years later that I realized just how wrong I'd been.

Later, all I remember from that afternoon was Thane arguing furiously with his mother, his face flushed red. In the end, he grabbed a knife from the bar counter and pressed it against his own throat.

Leaving a clear and long blood mark, he said resolutely and firmly: ""I'm not like my father. I'm not full of tricks. In this life, I only want to be with Sophie. Mom, I hope you can accept us.""

Perhaps Thane was too resolute or perhaps that streak of red was too shocking. In the end, Mrs. Cole compromised.

But as she left that day, there was something in her gaze I couldn't quite understand.

But I didn't understand then, I just thought every family had their issues.

My parents loved each other, but they were still traditional at heart, favoring my brother over me.

And Thane's parents were once a loving couple too. But the Cole family had a tradition of sponsoring underprivileged children's education.

That young, timid, yet charming girl caught Mr. Cole's eye, he finally fell for her.

Affairs, mistresses, more affairs, more mistresses.

After tasting the sweetness of indulgence, he couldn't stop. Women came and went, each more numerous than before.

A life of luxury and excess is always full of temptations. Mr. Cole, in his position of power, began to enjoy this decadence, growing more distant from Mrs. Cole.

Arguments? Crying? Threats? None of it worked. They fought year after year, until one of his mistresses showed up at their door with a barely visible pregnancy bump, begging Mrs. Cole to spare her life.

Thane watched his mother's tears, then looked at that woman who seemed pitiful but truly hateful. He reached out and pushed the woman down the stairs, blood staining the doorstep.

Mr. Cole was furious and sent him away to attend school in his hometown.

Then that's how Thane and I met, connected, and fell in love.

But ultimately?

Thane, who once despised homewreckers, fell in love with Lily, the scholarship student we sponsored, even buying her a million-dollar home.

So it wasn't until many years later that I understood‚Äîthat day, the look in Mrs. Cole's eyes wasn't born from being moved by our love or from compromise, but a pure pity.

It's a family curse‚Äîlike father, like son‚Äîit's a never-ending loop. She had always been warning me not to repeat her mistakes.

But unfortunately‚Äî

By the time I understood, it was too late.

As expected, Thane didn't agree to my request for divorce.

We met when we were sixteen, started dating at nineteen, married at twenty-five, had our first child at twenty-six and our second child at twenty-nine. Now at thirty-six, we were deeply intertwined, both emotionally and financially. So he refused to divorce me.

A wife and children at home, a fragile lover outside‚ÄîThane wanted to maintain this arrangement.

I mean, just think about it. If we divorced, those shares he gave me when he loved me most? They'd really mess him up financially and would severely weaken his position.

The Cole family had ambitious illegitimate sons and Thane wasn't the only heir.

But I couldn't give up everything and just leave with the children either. I must take what belongs to me.

So we reached an impasse.

Just like now, Thane again suggested I calm down while he took Lily away.

Lily had several bloody marks on her arm. One was deep enough to expose bone‚ÄîI'd cut her with the glass.

Thane sighed and said: ""Sophie, stay home and calm down. We can talk about anything later.""

Then he left with Lily.",1,1747052074.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False
