I‚Äôm a 19M, (student) and need some help finding a good place for a date. I recently met this girl, and we‚Äôve been engaging in some light, healthy flirting. She‚Äôs super nice, and she‚Äôs coming quite far just to meet me. While nothing is labeled yet, I feel like this could be a date.

I‚Äôm looking for a cafe that fits these criteria:

Affordable (student budget-friendly)

Cozy with some privacy (we‚Äôre both introverts, so a private space would be best)

Bonus: Book-themed or somewhere with a nice ambiance, we're both readers and movie watchers

good coffee (we‚Äôre both coffee drinkers, and like some good coffee)

Now my manager allowed me to work remotely, while I simply slept over during working hours for morning and afternoon times.

I think this is the right time to ask someone with experience for advice, as the doctor's suggestions do not seem to work and become less trustable in time.   
From what I've read, symptoms and treatment are individual for everyone but I think here is the place where someone can give me a hand.

So long story short:  
I had 2 months of stomach issues (never in my life have I had any stomach issues) and I was diagnosed wrongly twice - IBS and a stomach virus, so treatment brought nothing.  
Then another doctor asked me to test for Helicobacter and I got a positive quantitative test (3 times higher then max reference). She prescribed amoxiclav (antibiotics), nexium (PPI) and a probiotic. I felt way better when having the meds and thought it was gone but once I stopped them, my symptoms started reappearing - gasses that cause pain and after some foods or drink (coffee for example) - fatigue and nausea.  
I decided not to wait more before the second test (4 weeks have passed since the beginning of treatment) and got 39.1 Index when reference range is 0.9 - 1.1 and this looked **scary**, although it was totally unexpected, as I barely have some symptoms different than the gasses.  
My doctor is all for the medicine and don't even want to have a chat about other supplements and natural methods of curing Helicobacter.

So please, could anyone share the top supplements or foods that have proven to be working for most people?  
And what do you eat? I see veggies and fruits a lot but what exactly? I eat mainly bananas, meat and potatoes.

Any advice would be highly appreciated.

- Maintenance costs

Less financial strain means more freedom to pursue hobbies or travel, making the experience of living in a tiny home even more rewarding.

You will spend less time scrubbing floors or dusting shelves and more time enjoying life. This also allows you to invest your energy in what truly matters to you.

This is particularly appealing for those who prioritize travel or want to experience a minimalistic lifestyle without being tied down.

This efficient use of space encourages creativity in how you organize your belongings. You may also discover new ways to make your small living area feel larger through innovative design techniques, such as:

1hqa0lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1hqa0lj/my_ordinary_fkng_roommate/,My Ordinary Fkng Roommate ,"I didn‚Äôt plan on having a roommate in my late twenties, but after losing my job and struggling to keep up with rent, I didn‚Äôt have much choice. That‚Äôs how I ended up sharing an apartment with Ethan, a quiet guy in his early thirties who worked nights as a security guard.

At first, it was perfect. Ethan was the ideal roommate: clean, quiet, and hardly ever home. He‚Äôd come in the morning just as I was leaving for work, and by the time I got back, he was already gone.

The only odd thing about him was his locked room. When I asked him about it, he shrugged and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got some personal stuff in there. Nothing weird, just private.‚Äù Fair enough, I thought. Everyone has their quirks.

But as time went on, little things started to bother me.

I‚Äôd come home and find things moved around‚Äîmy laptop, my books, even the food in the fridge. It wasn‚Äôt dramatic, just enough to make me wonder if I was losing my mind.

One night, I found a photo of myself sitting on the coffee table. I didn‚Äôt remember taking it, and it was definitely not one I had printed. I asked Ethan about it the next morning. He smiled faintly and said, ‚ÄúMust‚Äôve fallen out of one of your books or something.‚Äù

His answer didn‚Äôt sit right with me, but I let it go.

Then there was the smell.

It started faint, like something rotting, and seemed to come from Ethan‚Äôs room. I brought it up casually one day, but he brushed it off, saying he‚Äôd accidentally left food in his backpack. He promised to take care of it, and the smell went away‚Äîfor a while.


---

One evening, Ethan texted me that he‚Äôd be working overtime and wouldn‚Äôt be back until the next morning. I took the opportunity to relax, finally having the place to myself. But as I sat on the couch, scrolling through my phone, I heard a soft thud coming from his room.

I froze.

Maybe he left a window open, I thought. Or maybe the building was just settling. But then I heard it again‚Äîlouder this time, like something heavy had been dropped.

I walked over to his door, pressing my ear against it.

Silence.

‚ÄúEthan?‚Äù I called out, even though I knew he wasn‚Äôt home. No answer.

My curiosity got the better of me. I grabbed a bobby pin from my room and picked the lock. I know, it was a violation of his privacy, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was wrong.

When the door swung open, the smell hit me like a brick wall‚Äîpungent, sour, and unmistakably rotten.

The room was dark, lit only by the glow of a small laptop on the desk. The walls were covered in pictures‚Äîof me. Some were candid shots, taken while I was out or at home. Others were older, clearly printed from my social media.

My stomach turned as I noticed one wall in particular. It was covered in sticky notes, all of them with my name scrawled over and over, alongside phrases like, ‚ÄúMine,‚Äù ‚ÄúForever,‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo one else.‚Äù

But what really made me want to scream was the mannequin in the corner.

It was dressed in one of my old shirts‚Äîthe one I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd lost in the laundry‚Äîand a wig that almost matched my hair. The mannequin‚Äôs face was painted with a crude smile, but the eyes‚Ä¶ they were replaced with pictures of my actual eyes, cut out and pasted on.

I stumbled back, nearly tripping over a duffel bag on the floor. It was partially open, revealing a knife, rope, and duct tape.

That‚Äôs when I noticed the laptop screen.

It was a live feed of my bedroom.

I bolted out of the room, slamming the door behind me. My hands were shaking as I called the police, but when they arrived, Ethan was already home.

He acted surprised, concerned even, when I told them what I‚Äôd found. But when they opened the room, it was empty.

No photos, no mannequin, no duffel bag. Just a clean, empty space.

They questioned Ethan, but he denied everything, claiming I must‚Äôve imagined it. Without evidence, there was nothing they could do.

I moved out that night, staying with a friend until I could find a new place.

But Ethan wasn‚Äôt done.

A week later, I received a package at my new address. Inside was a single sticky note with the word ‚ÄúMine‚Äù written on it, along with a photo of me sleeping in my new bed.

I don‚Äôt know how he found me, but I‚Äôve since changed my name and moved across the country.

Every so often, though, I feel like I‚Äôm being watched. And sometimes, I find sticky notes in places I know I didn‚Äôt leave them.

I‚Äôll never stop looking over my shoulder.

then surely it carves itself  
into the face of the man who walks past,  
his steps tracing the silence  
we pretend not to hear.  

His coat, more wound than garment,  
stitched from the ragged winters  
of strangers' mercy,  
is the sum of a hundred cold nights,  
the weight of every hand  
that pressed a coin into his palm  
and every hand that did not.  

He drifts like smoke  
through the arteries of the street,  
a man slipping through  
the clenched fists of reality,  
his presence folding neatly  
into the blind spots of hurried feet.  

A child tugs her mother‚Äôs sleeve,  
her gaze wide  
with the outline of a question  
that has yet to find words.  
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with him?‚Äù  
she might have asked,  
but her mother quickens her step,  
her grip tightening like a knot  
around small fingers,  
as though hunger were a contagion  
better left unsaid.  
The child glances back.  
The mother does not.  

The businessman clutches his briefcase,  
adjusts his watch,  
and keeps his eyes forward,  
as though the man were a fissure in the pavement,  
something to be stepped over,  
not touched.  
He tells himself it‚Äôs not his fault,  
not his burden,  
and if he quickens his pace,  
it is not fear but obligation  
that moves him away.  
At least, this is what he will tell himself later.  

The artist sketches him  
from a caf√© window,  
her pencil lingering  
on the lines of his face,  
the hollow beneath his cheekbones.  
She wonders if his story  
could fill a gallery,  
if his ruin could be framed,  
admired for its honesty.  
She does not rise  
when she finishes her coffee.  

A man with a dog stops.  
The dog sniffs the air,  
searching for the man‚Äôs story,  
pulling at the leash, curious.  
The man reaches into his pocket -                          
not for money,  
but for a cigarette,  
lighting it with a half-muttered apology:  
‚ÄúWish I could help.‚Äù  
The man on the street has heard this refrain before
and does not answer.  
It fills his silence  
but not his hunger.  

A teenager tosses  
a half-eaten sandwich into a bin,  
their headphones drowning out the world.  
The man watches,  
his eyes tracing the arc of the crust,  
the brief flight of something discarded  
that he might yet call a gift.  
He waits until the teenager is gone,  
then reaches into the bin,  
his fingers curling around the remains.  
He eats slowly,  
as though to stretch the moment into meaning.  

At dusk, a priest walks by,  
his rosary swaying  
like a pendulum of doubt.  
Their eyes meet,  
and the priest falters,  
his lips shaping words  
that stay locked in his throat.  
Is it shame that stalls him,  
or the quiet fear  
that faith holds no weight here?  
He whispers a prayer  
that dissolves into the wind,  
and moves on, absolved of sin.

If hunger sharpens the edges of survival,  
it also sharpens the world‚Äôs indifference
the countless ways we avert our gaze,  
or meet it,  
or let it linger too long.  

He carries these moments with him,  
a testament to a world  
that sees him,  
but does not stop.

In recent years it seems all of my friends want to go for meals at fancy places, or places you'd be spending easily 100 at. This isn't a problem to me other than the fact that for almost 10 years now, every time I want to do something on my birthday, no one is available, or just down right forget about it.

This year, 4 of my friends wanted me to go out and spend money for meals for their birthday, I managed to go to 3 of them, one of which I was only a day or two recovering from celulitus (which I'm not going to get into the fever and nausea)
And the 4th i couldn't make it because of the celulitus but I still messaged them and have planned to go to theirs and order food and drinks for us both.
But not a single one of those people even messaged me or acknowledged it was my birthday when it came around.

Now my birthday is the back end of December and I understand money is tight this time of year so I gave up trying to plan anything with people because it was always the same every year but have told them, even a message will do me, thats all i want, for them to acknowledge it if anything. The fact I don't even get a message from these people honestly annoys me.

Am i overreacting, I feel like I am because in the past when I brought up the fact friends have forgotten my birthday they seem to get annoyed over it, make excuses, tell me they did message me when I can and did prove they didn't, and others have even tried to put blame on me, so I don't know anymore.",1,1735631591.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

I‚Äôm hoping you can help me determine whether I have GERD. 

Long story short, I recently had an episode where I went to A&E in severe pain with my stomach. I had a bunch of blood tests done and they found that my gut was inflamed, so they gave me antibiotics and booked me in for a sigmoidoscopy. The results of that were all normal and the surgeon said it was all probably caused by an infection as everything looked fine. Since taking the antibiotics, I‚Äôve been feeling a lot better, so all of this may be isolated from my day to day symptoms. 

The reason I think I may have GERD, is because it has been mentioned by my doctor. I also believe I have a few of the general symptoms but I don‚Äôt really suffer from the main one which is acid reflux.

I do suffer with bloating, belching, feeling nauseous and a lump in my throat/chest multiple times in a week. I also feel the drip at night, sometimes a tickling cough and I feel congested a lot of the time and it‚Äôs not uncommon for my lymph nodes to slightly swollen around my ears and neck. 

I‚Äôve recently cut coffee from my diet and that has helped and the next thing is going to be dairy. I don‚Äôt drink much alcohol anymore because that is a big trigger.

I've yet to actually get a response from anyone on this sub so thought l'd go ahead and make my own post and see if my luck changes
Looking for my other half who is also someone I would consider to be my best friend.

I am in Las Vegas hispanic (both my parents are Mexican but I was born in the states, San Diego) 5'9"", 220lbs, brown eyes, No tattoos nor piercings (it's fine to me if you do, but those aren't things I want for myself).

I rarely drink, I don't smoke, I don't vape, and I don't do drugs. Tried them once or twice but never again. I can handle it if you drink so long as it is infrequent or for special occasions or something, but smoking, vaping, and drugs are absolute deal breakers.

Spent most of my 20s working a lot of jobs. I was trying to figure what I wanted and what I can be good for. Worked in construction, restaurants, coffee shops, welding, handyman, auto mechanic, school teacher, office jobs. I‚Äôm glad I did all of that because I learned just about anything in any field. 

I used to work on a ship for national geographic as a sous chef. I made breads, deserts, appetizers, crew meals. It‚Äôs more of a fill in job. I do have a fulltime job at another ship. Doing the exact same thing. I love it because I get to travel a lot and save a lot of money on rent and bills. 
Since I work on ships I‚Äôm almost never in Vegas. I‚Äôm always somewhere else. Either in San Diego or in Mexico with my parents. I do work 6 weeks on and 6 weeks off. So dating for me is hard, I understand many can‚Äôt do that. And that‚Äôs ok.

I am a dual Mexican/American citizenship. I am currently buying a house in Mexico with my parents. I plan to start up my own family style restaurant/ coffee shop in Mexico.
I do go to Mexico often because that‚Äôs where my parents live I go about 3-4 times a year. They can‚Äôt come to the US. So that‚Äôs like an important thing for me. 

I'm not too picky or into much about music, but mostly right now I listen to techno or Hans Zimmerman soundtracks. 

I listen to podcasts, usually educational or self improvement type stuff... usually as something to do while l'm out alone on a walk.

I do want kids/ family one day. 

I do ask you to be honest. For example If there‚Äôs something you don‚Äôt like about me, tell me and we can solve that problem. Vice versa. I‚Äôm not here to play games or anything. I just want to have a partner that is willing to go on trips with me and have a good time. 

I‚Äôm a very active person, hobby wise I like to go on hikes, and biking, I also like to go camping. I like to drive very far and go to new cities or parks and just explore and see what‚Äôs new to me. And photograph mountains, beaches, sunsets.
I have like 4 cameras so I really like to take photos of everything, even though I still forget to take them. I‚Äôm just enjoying the moment haha

Before I worked on a ship, about 2 years ago. I wanted to know more of my body, basically what it could handle. What I mean is I went vegan for 7 months and I lost 60lbs. I also sold my car and I was riding my bike 20-30miles a day. I also fasted a lot. Most I ever did was 5 days. It may not be super interesting but for me it was like a life changing time for me. 

I‚Äôm not really into politics, if I had to consider which way I‚Äôm leaning would be more on the right. I also believe in God. But I‚Äôm open to anyone. I have friends on both sides and atheists who are really close and good friends to me. 
we can go into deep into my views I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be interesting.

I think I'm pretty funny and sarcastic, though I don't think that's really showing here... come chat with me though and maybe we will see

I am pretty introverted but I‚Äôm not a shy person. I only say what I need or want to say. I don‚Äôt talk just to talk. And I listen more than I talk. So if you‚Äôre someone who talks a lot I don‚Äôt mind that. I also like learning from other people. 
I open up a lot more the more comfortable I get.

I‚Äôm not really picky but I prefer someone 21-35, no kids, white, Hispanic, Asian someone who lives in the US or Europe, I‚Äôd love to go to Europe. 

If you've gotten this far, thank you & leave your age and location in your response, and a bit about you... let's see if we get along.

1hq9x2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/EastAsiaRetails/comments/1hq9x2u/south_koreas_coffee_industry_struggling_due_to/,South Korea's coffee industry struggling due to coffee bean inflation and high fx rate,"South Korea's leading instant coffee brand, Dongseo Food, faces the risk of a deficit next year due to soaring international coffee bean prices and a high exchange rate. Since the company fully relies on imports for key raw materials like coffee and sugar, concerns are growing internally. A spokesperson for Dongseo Food stated, ""If sales remain similar to this year, we anticipate a significant deficit. As we have already increased prices recently, we will need to explore other solutions, such as cost-cutting, to protect profitability.""

International coffee bean prices recently hit a 47-year high, adding to the financial burden on coffee brands. Arabica coffee, widely used by Starbucks, the leading coffeehouse chain, and Dongseo Food, the top instant coffee retailer, reached $3.44 per pound on December 10, surpassing the previous record of $3.38 set in 1977.

The spike in Arabica prices is primarily attributed to ""climate inflation"" caused by abnormal weather. Prolonged droughts in Brazil, which produces more than half of the world's coffee beans, have disrupted supply. Although some drought relief occurred in October, insufficient soil moisture continues to hinder coffee cultivation.

Compounding these challenges, prolonged political unrest has pushed the Korean won-dollar exchange rate to its highest level in nearly 16 years, further straining domestic coffee retailers. South Korea, often referred to as a ""coffee republic"" due to its high per capita coffee consumption, is particularly vulnerable to these inflationary pressures

[In 2022, there were 107,729 coffee shops in South Korea.](https://preview.redd.it/ewdjh0k725ae1.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5ce60d940e45055b75c4fe39bc941059d3a7c5c)

1hq9vpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1hq9vpi/the_trapped/,THE TRAPPED,"He tipped his French press as far as it would go, hoping to pour that last and most potent drop of coffee into his stained mug. He does this every morning, along with a myriad of other meticulous actions commonly misconstrued as ‚ÄúOCD.‚Äù Perhaps he was just particular, which he most certainly was. He knew his house‚Äîmore so a cottage isolated in the mountains‚Äîlike the back of his hand because of these nuances, coupled with keeping everything generally tidy and neat. He also lived alone, which suited his lifestyle. However, while being convenient to him by himself, it‚Äôs also the reason for his loneliness. Weeks often go by without contact save for sight or sound of the small mammals that scurry about the place top and bottom.

And then it started. On a regular Tuesday, according to his printed calendar, he heard the first scratching from what he thought came from within the fireplace. Instinct told him it was nothing more than an animal that had fallen in, in which case, it would eventually find its way back out with ease. His second thought told him the scratching didn‚Äôt quite sound like animal claws, but as always, he went with his gut. Days went by with nothing to report until he heard it again at around noon. He was sitting reading the newspaper in front of the fireplace. He stood up and walked towards the bricks that laid the chimney. Pressing his ear against them to hear more, he tried to listen carefully beyond the scratches with hopes of catching any other hint at what kind of animal was stuck within the walls.¬†

That‚Äôs when he heard a faint whisper, something that sounded like it was made with lips; something beginning with ‚ÄúS‚Äù but trailed off so faintly that all else was lost on him. Then he heard it again. Then again every once in a while over the next few days. The sound seemed to come periodically after a few scratches but was always dull and certainly confusing. Reasoning that the worst thing to come from this is having a dead animal eventually decompose in his chimney, he gives up on the mystery altogether. On a lazy Sunday, he went to pick up his French press, ready to pour out that vital last drop when he suddenly heard an exasperated yet distinct ‚Äústop.‚Äù He stood up immediately in sheer panic. Ignoring questions of concern over how such a predicament came to be, his morality went into overdrive as he scrambled through the firebox opening in an attempt to help whoever he thought had clearly fallen in through the chimney top.

As he scratched his way through the caked-up ash and soot, all the while calling out to whoever was up there, questions of who this person was and why they were stuck seeped their way in, almost distracting him from the task at hand. Mindlessly inching his way upwards, he began wondering how this person survived days of being stuck like this, as it‚Äôs been just shy of a week since he heard the first scratching. He shifted further up the shoot, not noticing the walls getting tighter due to the convergence of the chimney‚Äôs design. Swept up in a whirlpool of panic, heroism, confusion and adrenaline, it took him a few breaths before realising that he was now stuck, unable to move either up or down. Furthermore and most perplexing, there were no signs of anyone else up there. That‚Äôs when fear enveloped itself over him. How could this be? How is it that he was now in this predicament of being stuck in his own chimney when he was supposed to be there saving someone else in his position?

Every strength was wasted in trying to budge even an inch in any direction. Screams and cries raged all through the days and nights for what felt like almost a week. Slowly he grew exhausted; even more when he accepted that he was trapped within his own house. All he could muster was a pathetic attempt at scratching away at the inside wall. With every tired breath, he found it in him to utter the words ‚Äústop,‚Äù not in an attempt to catch someone‚Äôs attention, but in an attempt to warn them.

It is going to sound like our marriage should have never happened, and that might be true. But it did, and neither of us wants to divorce, so here we are. 

My husband (40s) and I (30s) have been together 13 years, married 10. We only got married because I told him I was not going to live in sin forever, and I was moving out. He proposed as I was packing my car. Prior to being married, we were both broke and working stressful shift work jobs.  We didn't do much because we couldn't afford to. We went to the park, played Mario Bros, watched tv.

Over the years, there have been so many emotional things that he fell short on (list below). It has all just left me emotionally distant from him. I am also to blame. He says I talk ""at"" him, and I know I've said things I shouldn't have (I've told him sex was bad, and that I wouldn't have married him if I had known then how it would go).

Now, after all these years, he tells me he wants to fix it. He says he wants to work on the things that have driven us apart.  He wants to rebuild the connection. But I don't know how.  How do you put behind you so many years of this? How do you build a connection that was never that strong to begin with?





*not being willing to contribute to a conversation unless the topic directly involved him (i talk, he was silent. Even before our wedding, I would pause the TV to say something and as soon as I was done, he would hit play)

*ignoring it when I was obviously upset with him (which was often, usually because i felt unseen or not considered/prioritized)

*mostly replacing me with porn (for years,  but stopped years ago, although our sex life did not recover)

*never seeming to enjoy activities We did together (unless they were his idea), otherwise he just seemed to be tolerating it. Bump on a log.

*discounting my feelings (I get overwhelmed, anxious, and fearful, which he takes as a personal offense)

*discouraging or complaining or arguing about any hobby or activity I find interest in, if it might inconvenience him, if it costs money, or if he just doesn't understand it (we once argued because he refused to stop for coffee every time I asked. We would be passing the drive thru and able to afford it, and he would refuse because he didn't want to)

*being generally inconsiderate (embarrassing me in public by out loud discussing our personal finances, my political opinions, or my plans for xyz - things that I would say to him but no one else)

*lack of in depth conversation. We talk about our kid, dinner, the events of our day. We don't normally talk about anything else. I stopped trying years ago because it was normally met with silence, like talking to wall, or an argument if he didn't agree with my position

*ignoring birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas, etc. He has gotten better about this since our daughter was old enough to chew him out for it. But my first Mother's day, I got nothing, not even a card, until AFTER I got upset.

*Being mildly offensive toward my personality (I say ""reuse/repurpose,"" he says hoarder. He also fussed at me for buying a trash can for my car because ""it would just get full""???)

*I have never felt like I could be my authentic self, because if he wasn't the same or didn't agree, he either stonewalled or yelled about it.",1,1735631010.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

But then again, I wrote a letter for everyone in class, and you knew that. And I‚Äôm sure you read it by now. I‚Äôm sure you read that very lackluster generic letter. I told you how I was really glad to get to know you and that I think you‚Äôre really smart and funny. And those things are true. But I want to tell you what I really do think of you.

You‚Äôre just such an enigma. You‚Äôre more on the introverted side sure, but people like you in class. You‚Äôre very witty. Not to mention just so freaking intelligent. Thank you for saving my life a few weeks ago during class. I completely effed up the presentation, but you stepped in and helped me. But I‚Äôm getting too sidetracked. I‚Äôve always been attracted to you. I just hope you know how handsome you are. I know in your culture, it‚Äôs not common to smile, but I genuinely feel happy whenever I see you smile. I could listen to your voice all day. It‚Äôs like music to my ears.

I loved the little ways you showed kindness to me. Like when you were the only one that noticed me not following the group to the market after class and he waited for me. And he walked with me. Or that time when I spilled coffee all over my desk and he got me paper towels to clean it. I love the big ways too. Like how you were one of the few people to come to my birthday party. You got me that huge bouquet of flowers. I felt so special.

The one regret I have about that night is not getting any alone time with you. Were you trying to get me alone? Because you still hadn‚Äôt finished your assignment that was due that night. And now that it‚Äôs getting time for you to return back home, I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôll never see you again. I‚Äôm scared that maybe this is all in my head. Maybe you were just trying to be a good friend to me and I‚Äôm completely misinterpreting the situation. Even so, I‚Äôm so happy that I got to know you.

I‚Äôve been struggling with BED for over 8 years of my life and am on Vyvanse currently early 50mg daily, or when i actually take it (usually 1-4 times a week, 1-3 weeks not taking:/). Been on it since June/July this year and the effects have been inconsistent due to my lack of taking them. Anyways. 

With this I notice when I‚Äôve binged I usually eat the same foods over and over again. Suddenly I have 4 bags from McDonald‚Äôs in one day, and I live in a communal place so there‚Äôs always people walking, and trash cans filled. I have cleared my car out maybe 5-6 times to help get rid of the waste and garbage from my binges, but as soon as it‚Äôs gone it piles up again. I never to do this in my bedroom though, only my car. I go through the drive thru, I eat, and I rarely toss the bag outside the car. I don‚Äôt do this because I enjoy being dirty, my room is spotless, I have a high maintenance skin and hair routine, I‚Äôm a 3.7 gpa college student, I easily get rid of trash or items I no longer want, but my car filled with trash and evidence of my greed is there.

I‚Äôve hidden it from my partner, friends, covered it up with sprays, plug ins, cleaned everything I could, it just gets bad over and over again. The thought of carrying a bag of fast food for my peers at school to see fills me with shame, and I leave my trash in the car. I am disgusted by it and cleaned out my car yesterday as I finally am not at college and wanted to throw up out of disgust to myself and the things I found inside. It was a complete hoarders hell but in my car, and it is disgusting but thankfully no damage, just a spray down with alcohol and removal of build up will fix it. However the hoarding , the hiding, the shame, it feels so different than what I am to others functionally and I am disgusted. I hope this never happens again, I thankfully will no longer have a car once I move to a city, but maggots I saw in my old coffee cups today made me break down and cry. My own gluttony has done this and my own lazinesses and nothing else. Idk had anyone else done this I feel insane

Living alone for that long however was lonely even though I had a loving second family but I wanted marriage for her to move in with me and to not be alone anymore and when I proposed last year she happily accepted and we kissed and her family were so happy for both of us, and then our supposed wedding came in this past June, and infront of our whole family and friends she said no and ran outside crying, and I just stood there feeling like this was all just a dream but no it was reality. She destroyed me that day, her parents went after her as I stood there seeing all those people whispering and looking at me and I just snapped, I went home and threw all her stuff away that was already there and then went straight to the airport to go to our honeymoon alone because it was expensive as hell and most of the trip was non refundable and I had already lost a lot of money in the failed marriage. 

Her family kept trying to get in contact with me over the next two weeks but I deactivated all my socials, even after I returned home I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to see any of them so I even avoided work. I live in a small village where everyone knows everyone and everyone here talks, and ever since that day people made me this evil bastard that forced this innocent little girl into marrying but she heroically saved herself, which is all bullshit I never even raised my voice over her.

Life then went on and I found another lawyer to do my internship with and he was nowhere near as good as my ex fianc√©s dad but it wasn‚Äôt that bad, and they stopped trying to reach out to me and people stopped talking about the whole thing and it felt like it‚Äôs just moving on, when suddenly around two weeks ago I was chilling at home alone at night and her dad came over, I of course welcomed him in and offered coffee and he accepted, before we could talk he started apologising for his daughter saying she got cold feet at the last second and refused, and that he too wasn‚Äôt proud of her and wasn‚Äôt happy about the whole situation, and I told him it was none of his fault and that I‚Äôm sorry for ghosting him but it just was painful to be around him especially since she looks so much like him even though I still love him.

He asked me whether I like to come back and work with him even if I just want our relationship to just be a work relationship because he loves me like a son and doesn‚Äôt wanna lose that and I told him I‚Äôd think about it.

What are your go to ways to occupy your fidgety feet?,"I keep thinking about social norms and always being taught as a child about 'lady-like' behavior which barring certain 'safety precautions', for the most part I felt to be stuffy and frivolous. Why did people, especially ladies, always feel they needed to comport themselves in certain ways, sit in uncomfortable positions, wear immensely uncomfortable clothes, and force themselves to walk in shoes - yeah let's not even taught about shoes, lol - that essentially deformed their feet! I tried multiple times to walk up and down the landing in my mother's high heels, stare in wonder at Aunty M's hugely deformed feet, and other ladies (my mother included) bunioned feet and just couldn't fathom the agony...

Anyways, on to the real story: 

Since as far as I can remember I have hated having to sit 'prim and proper', always stared intrigued at those with crossed legs, unable to fathom how they keep them crossed (still can't fathom this - mine just bounces off unless of course my foot is rammed against something holding it in place!).

Right now I type this at work with my shoes off and legs crossed (lotus style) and feet tucked snuggly under or above. Whenever I work in a coffee shop, it's the same, within five minutes, or as soon as have my drink, snack and table cleaned and set up for work, my shoes are off and my feet on the chair. One time I was having a drink with a friend and I was sitting Uncle Roger style lol, (yes, my shoes were off) and the barista came over and told me to sit properly as I was making the coffee shop look degenerate (or something to that effect).

Even with customers, in meetings, if there is a table between us, my shoes are off and feet tucked under me. On the plane I can barely wait for takeoff before I am shoe-less, I even have a special non-slip pair of socks just for the plane, because I don't know about anyone else but plane seats are as slippery as an ice rink!

At home, barring when the weather is cold, I always go barefoot. I love nothing better than running barefoot through the grass (as long as it is not a dog frequented zone lol), sitting cross-legged on the ground watching nature go by.

Anyone else similar? And how do you keep your wild feet happy lol?

Rugs bring warmth, define spaces, and elevate the overall ambiance of your interiors. Whether you‚Äôre browsing [carpets online Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/rugs) or visiting [home decor shops](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/), finding the perfect fit for your living room, bedroom, and dining area is essential. Here‚Äôs a detailed guide to help you select the ideal rug size for each space while incorporating the latest trends, including [cotton rug](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/black-and-white-rug) and stylish [grey carpet](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/etienne-rug-grey).

# 1. Living Room: Anchor Your Furniture with Confidence

The living room is often the centerpiece of your home, and your rug should tie the entire space together. Here are three popular layout options:

* **Large Area Rugs:** Place a rug large enough to accommodate all your furniture, with the front legs of the sofa and chairs sitting on the rug. This layout works well for open-plan living areas.
* **Smaller Rugs:** If you‚Äôre using a smaller rug, ensure it is placed under the coffee table, leaving some floor space visible around the edges.
* **Oversized Rugs:** For a luxurious feel, choose a rug that extends beyond the furniture, making the room appear larger.

**Style Tip:** A cotton rug is an excellent choice for a casual, easy-to-maintain living room look. For a modern touch, opt for a grey carpet that complements a neutral color palette.

# 2. Bedroom: Comfort and Style Underfoot

In the bedroom, rugs create a cozy, welcoming vibe. Here‚Äôs how to choose the right size:

* **Large Rugs:** Position a rug under the bed, ensuring it extends at least two feet beyond the bed‚Äôs edges. This setup provides a soft landing for your feet every morning.
* **Runners:** For smaller spaces or minimalist designs, place runners on either side of the bed to add texture without overwhelming the room.
* **Partial Coverage:** A smaller rug placed at the foot of the bed can add a decorative element while leaving some floor space uncovered.

**Pro Tip:** If you‚Äôre shopping for carpets online in Dubai, look for high-quality cotton or wool rugs that blend durability with style. A grey carpet is versatile and works beautifully with both light and dark bedding.

# 3. Dining Area: Balance Functionality with Elegance

Rugs in dining areas serve both aesthetic and practical purposes. They should define the space while protecting your floors from wear and tear. Here‚Äôs how to size them correctly:

* **Under the Table:** Choose a rug that‚Äôs large enough to fit the table and chairs, even when the chairs are pulled out. This prevents tripping hazards and ensures the rug looks proportional to the furniture.
* **Shape Matching:** For round tables, select a round rug to enhance symmetry. For rectangular tables, an elongated rug works best.

**Material Tip:** A **cotton rug** is ideal for dining areas as it‚Äôs easy to clean and soft underfoot. When visiting **home decor shops**, consider neutral tones or subtle patterns for timeless appeal.

# Why Size Matters

Choosing the right rug size isn‚Äôt just about aesthetics‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating harmony in your space. A rug that‚Äôs too small can make your furniture look disconnected, while an oversized rug may overwhelm the room. Always measure your space and furniture layout before purchasing.

# Exploring Rugs and Carpets in Dubai

Dubai is a hub for exquisite home decor, offering a wide range of rugs and carpets to suit every style and budget. When shopping for carpets online in Dubai, you‚Äôll find options that cater to minimalist modern designs and opulent traditional aesthetics. Visiting home decor shops in person allows you to feel the texture and see the true colors of your choices.

# Final Thoughts

The perfect rug size enhances your home‚Äôs overall look, providing both functionality and style. Whether you‚Äôre considering a durable cotton rug for high-traffic areas or a chic grey carpet for a contemporary feel, selecting the right size ensures your space looks cohesive and inviting.

1hq9gw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hq9gw4/should_i_ask_my_coworker_out_for_a_date/,Should I ask my coworker out for a date?,"I (28M) had a harmless crush on a coworker (27F) who recently joined our office. Honestly, she‚Äôs everything I could ask for in a potential partner, kind, generous, ambitious, and incredibly sweet to everyone. We occasionally go for walks during office hours to grab Messina, coffee, or Yo-Chi, and I really enjoy spending time with her.

Recently, I‚Äôve started developing deeper feelings for her. I spent a day helping her move into her new apartment, and she and her friend helped me with some shopping afterward. We trade memes and reels occasionally, and I find myself subconsciously hoping my phone notifications will pop up with her name.

This situation reminds me of something similar that happened back in university days. I had a genuine and kind friend I developed feelings for, and when I finally worked up the courage to ask her out, she told me she only saw me as a friend. She ended up dating a mutual batchmate, and seeing them together hurt a lot. Eventually, I cut contact with her, and in the process, I lost a good friend.

I‚Äôm not conventionally attractive and probably just an average Joe. Right now, I‚Äôm torn. Should I ask this coworker out on a date and risk rejection or potentially being ‚Äúfriendzoned‚Äù? I don‚Äôt want to lose her as a friend if things go sideways, but at the same time, I‚Äôll never know if we could‚Äôve worked romantically unless I take the chance.

I‚Äôve also been reading about ‚Äúconvenience crushes‚Äù and how spending a lot of time with someone can make you feel attached. Am I misreading her kindness and friendliness as something more, or is there a chance she could feel the same way?

If I do decide to ask her out, how should I approach it, considering we work together? I‚Äôd really appreciate some advice!",1,1735629311.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

the other day at work, i had a customer come in who looked very little like him, but had his exact vocal cadence, brushed his hair out of his face the same way, crossed his arms the same way, didnt order an actual coffee but a sweet drink (my abuser hated coffee) and as unrealistic as it is, i cant help but feel like maybe it was him, and he got surgery to look different, or maybe used prosthetics. i know its ridiculous, hes in new york right now, and i check his parents facebook daily to make sure hes not near me, and he still looks the exact same. 

my partner is such a loving, sweet, caring person, and im so lucky to have them, but i keep comparing them to my abuser and i hate it. i feel so guilty, it makes me feel so undeserving of their love. i dont feel like im ever going to be safe again, i never feel comfortable. i always feel like my partner will say ""i bought you this, so you owe me"" just like he would. i hate it so much. i dont know what to do anymore, i hate this body, i hate that hes touched me. i hate that there are still cells in my body that were around when he hurt me, and no matter how hard i scrub it will never leave me. i dont know how to live like this, i just want to feel safe one day.",2,1735629263.0,traumatoolbox,1,1.0,False

# 1. Why Pendant Lights Are Perfect for Any Space

Pendant lights, often referred to as [hanging ceiling lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights), provide focused illumination while adding character to a room. Their versatility allows them to serve both functional and decorative purposes. Available in a variety of shapes, sizes, and finishes, pendant lights can be tailored to suit modern, industrial, minimalist, or bohemian aesthetics.

# 2. Living Room: Style Meets Functionality

The living room is a prime spot for hanging lights for living room setups. Pendant lights can be used to create focal points, highlight specific areas, or add layers of lighting for a cozy atmosphere.

**Tips for Styling Pendant Lights in the Living Room:**

* Hang multiple pendant lights at varying heights for a dynamic look.
* Use a black pendant light for a bold, modern statement that contrasts beautifully with neutral or light-colored interiors.
* Position a cluster of hanging ceiling lights over a coffee table or seating area to anchor the space visually.

# 3. Kitchen: Functional and Stylish Illumination

Pendant lights are a kitchen essential, offering both practical lighting and design flair. Pendant lights for kitchen islands or countertops provide focused task lighting, making food preparation safer and more efficient.

**Styling Ideas for Kitchens:**

* Install a row of matching pendant lights over your kitchen island for a clean, symmetrical look.
* Opt for metallic or black pendant **light** finishes to achieve a sleek, contemporary vibe.
* Consider adjustable hanging ceiling lights for versatile lighting that adapts to various tasks.

# 4. Dining Room: Set the Mood

Pendant lights can elevate the ambiance of your dining area, making every meal feel special. A well-chosen pendant light adds warmth and sophistication, drawing attention to the dining table as the centerpiece of the room.

**Design Tips:**

* Choose a pendant light with a wide shade to spread soft, even light across the table.
* Use a dimmer switch to control the intensity of your hanging ceiling lights, perfect for both casual dinners and formal gatherings.
* A black pendant light with metallic accents can create an elegant contrast, especially in modern dining rooms.

# 5. Bedroom: Create a Cozy Retreat

**Ideas for Bedroom Pendant Lighting:**

* Hang pendant lights low on either side of the bed for a sleek, minimalist look.
* Choose soft, warm light bulbs to create a relaxing ambiance.
* Consider textured or natural materials for the shades to complement a cozy aesthetic.

**Bathroom Pendant Lighting Tips:**

* Install hanging ceiling lights above the vanity for flattering, focused lighting.
* Use moisture-resistant finishes to ensure durability in humid conditions.

# 7. Choosing the Right Pendant Lights

* **Size:** Ensure the scale of the light matches the room‚Äôs dimensions. Oversized pendants work well in larger spaces, while smaller ones suit compact areas.
* **Height:** Hang the lights at the appropriate height to avoid glare and maintain functionality. For instance, in a kitchen, the bottom of the light should hang 30-36 inches above the countertop.
* **Style:** Choose materials and finishes that complement your existing decor. Black pendant light styles, for example, suit modern or industrial designs, while glass or natural-fiber shades are ideal for bohemian or coastal interiors.

# 8. Why Pendant Lights Are a Must-Have

Home setup used to be Silvia (added pid), baratza sette 270. Upgraded to isomac millennium I've picked up not working from thrift store, fixed, insulated, modded. Switched to df64 v2 grinder.

Travel coffee was aeropres where I would pregrind beans at home. Added 1zpresso to the mix for longer trips, switched to robot. Recently got Chinese 58mm pneumatic machine that works quite well with 150psi Ryobi tire inflator, but got tired of the process and space and time it takes to pull the shot (requires preheating the group, super loud inflator, CO2 tanks do not work well or consistently), plus separate stovetop milk foaming pita. Also tried to carry Silvia around, but it takes too much time and energy to get it up to temps.

Started to look at thermoblock/thermojet machines, so far getting ready to pull the trigger on Bambino (not plus), are there better options with quick heat up and small footprint to get a good espresso and steam milk, while not requiring to setup full blown camp kitchen (flair/robot, separate stove and stovetop steamer). Ready to mod, if pulling trigger on Bambino will be doing pressure and temperature mods, basket and portafilter obviously. What bugs me most is 54mm vs 58mm filter.

Shifting the gears and just flooring the truck would not have worked I knew so I had to build up the speed, my mind was racing through every form of PTSD and my body wanted to freeze. It was a cold morning but from the fear and adrenaline I did not care as I pushed the truck to the max, I passed the thing, and it began to run behind the truck. It was fast and I wasn‚Äôt exactly a mile away from it, so I managed to catch up with the truck and hit the side of the truck. The impact was not exactly earth shattering but it still causes me to momentarily loose control, since the ground was hard from the cold i managed to keep some control and pushed it forward. Looking at the rear view the massive hand of the thing was holding on to the rear door. It slowed the truck a little but the adrenaline in me kept the gas pedal down, I could feel the strain on the tires but honestly it didn‚Äôt make much of a difference as it had to let go from the strain and I bolted forward.

I darted for my gate and onto the main road out, I kept one eye on the rear view and could see it running forward after me. Once on the main road I gained speed and saw that it could not catch up, then after a few steps it disappeared into the woods, after that I kept my eyes on the road but knew it will probably be stalking me. After a few miles I could feel the adrenaline withdraw and the fatigue kicked in and my hands were shaking from all this, my vision was also slowly fogging as I wasn‚Äôt exactly at peak health, so I knew I needed to stop and catch my breath. After another 20 minutes I saw a few cars coming my way with the sheriff‚Äôs car at the front, I hailed at them, and I could see they were slowing and I did the same and stopped in front of the column of cars.

I then placed my hands over the steering wheel and my head on top of it, I needed to breath and could hear the sheriff call my name. What felt like a second was a few minutes as the sheriff had run out of his cruiser and found me slumped over my wheel, he opened my door and with the help of the few locals brought me out and lay me on the side of the road. The doc was with them, and he gave me an jab of something to wake me up, I opened my eyes and looked up at the grey sky trying to remember where the actual fuck I was but I guess the rush of memories was just waiting for me to fully wake up. I was helped up and could see several men walking around looks towards the woods as if something was about to jump out.

The sheriff squatted down and handed me a tin mug of coffee which I took and enjoyed its warmth, I then realised I was only dressed in a flannel shirt and jeans for exactly warm for this cold. I took a few sips and could feel the memories walk in and then recounted exactly what happened after I dropped the phone, the men were also listening, and none spoke till I finished. The older of the group I knew as Old Jeb spoke first, ‚Äúlooks like you had a run with the ‚Äòsquach Mason, this one looks like he must be pissed at someone. Your shots may have just ticked him off further, you still alive may give us some hope but we need to head on over to your place and see if we can finish this thing.‚Äù

The other man muttered their agreements, the sheriff stood up and spoke, ‚ÄúI know y‚Äôall want to finish this fucker before it gets to your places, but we need to do this with a plan or we all die. Marsh boys, Jeb and Tom you move on forward and keep an eye out, anything moves fire first, we need to either end it or maim it. I don‚Äôt want to go back with a few less men you got that. Mason you will be with me, your truck will stay here, that flat you got will not take you any further anyway.‚Äù I looked at my truck but did not see where the flat was, I got up and walked over to the other side and saw, there was a large dent on the back and the flat was worn down to the rim. It was parked on the side of the road and the men were already pilling into their cars and I followed the sheriff to his cruiser.

I checked my shotgun and cocked it, the round was ready and it was already loaded for me thanks to the Marsh boys. I sat back and waited for the sheriff to start, he radioed to his station on the situation and asked for more units to be sent in case things got out of hand. I looked at the men in cars, they looked angry and ready to butcher anything that stood in their way. Blood will paid in blood in this place, there was not simpler solution here unless there was a reason for it, there have been generations of families wiped out by this simple rule but there were others that rose. My family descended from farmers that worked the hard land and lumber here. The sheriff handed me some jerky, ‚Äúyou need to eat something, whatever that thing is I need you to be sharp. It may be a sasquatch but only care to know what it really is after its dead. I heard the body count in the other place was as high as 10 people so whatever it is I would rather have it with an extra hole in the head.‚Äù

I asked about the girl and the sheriff mentioned that she was air lifted out as there was nothing the doc could do for here, also the state troopers refused to assist as they had too few to spare along with the wardens. We were on our own, like I said our government did not care for us small town folk, fuck them. Blood for blood.

As we drove back to my place I was started to go over all the details in my mind and trying to figure out how it managed to hide in the barn or did it try to rip out the door looking for me. I was running the whole situation in my mind as the convoy drew closer to my home. One moment I was looking out the window with my shotgun ready the next I hear loud bangs from the front cars, they were firing at a particular spot in the trees, looked like they saw something move. The sheriff shot out and signalled to stop firing, he turned to see where they were firing and there was nothing there, I got out and joined him. Walking over to where he was I looked down at the door and could see where my truck had passed there were black gouges on the road, looking back I never thought I would be such a situation but here we are. I stood next to the sheriff and looked over to the spot that was smoking from all the firing, walked forward without thinking to take a better look and the sheriff put a hand on my shoulder to hold me back. There was nothing there just a shattered trunk and fallen leaves, I looked around and could feel the eyes of something on me. It was here or it was just the paranoia but I could feel a tightness in my chest and now my blood was freezing. I turned to walk back to the cruiser along with the sheriff as something flew out of the forest and hit the first car, it was a broken branch and I dove for the ground as the men in the second car began firing at the direction of where the branch flew from.

After a few minutes the firing stopped and then there was complete silence in the air, a loud roar was heard coming from the woods and that just about froze everyone. One by one the men got out of their cars and huddled together looking out in every direction, their guns were ready and they were scared now. Whatever courage they had was unloaded in the first round of bullets now all that was left was raw fear and instinct to survive. They muttered prayers and cruses under their breath, slowly looking at everything and anything, I was up and looking around to see and I noticed the shadow moving the woods and I pointed my gun at it. Noting where I was looking the men also followed my line of sight and aimed their guns, it was then another thing flew out of the woods from another direction and a couple of them knocking them on to the ground the other scattered and began firing haphazardly into the forest, the sheriff tried to stop them but the fear had now a complete grip of these men. I knew this tactic as it was used by the Vietcong to split platoons of soldiers, the simplest tactic but the most effective. This however shattered my mind, there were more of them, I turned to the sheriff and shouted ‚Äúthere are more of them, tell the boys to get back into the trucks we need to get out of here or we are dead sheriff.‚Äù Just as I finished the line something darted out of the woods and grabbed one of the closest man and yanked him into the woods, his screaming could be heard and then snap.

The silence returned at it was like a landslide it covered everything; the men were in total shock now and it looked like we were ambushed. One by one the men slowly began to huddle again and move towards where the man I knew as Tommy Wilkes was taken into. I followed them as I did not want to stand alone, we crossed over into the woods and it the shade it was another world we entered. As we trudged forward all the men were quiet just looking in every direction. I looked around and could feel my heart pounding in my chest and my breath felt like I was breathing in hot sand.

We found Tommy‚Äôs remains and a couple of the others lost their breakfast, Tommy was ripped in 2 and his entrails were scattered around him along with all the blood and viscera. To me it looked like he was a grenade victim, I walked closer and began to examine him better the sheriff tried to gather the rest to bring some order, a couple of them were screaming at him while others were crying doom. Tommy was ripped in 2 but 2 different hands and now I understood completely what was happening, one hid in the barn while the other ripped the doors out thinking it was saving the other. I got up and told the sheriff we need to leave now. I heard the roars again but this time there was one more.",2,1735628853.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

But as AI becomes more powerful, some can‚Äôt help but wonder: are we relying too much on it? Could game development one day become a boring, assembly-line process with no room for imagination?

The charm of hand-crafted worlds would be lost, and a ""randomly generated"" world might start to feel just that‚Äîrandom and uninspired.
2. **Creative ""Copy-Paste"" Syndrome** AI grows by feeding on vast amounts of data. Its ""creativity"" is essentially piecing together bits of what already exists. It‚Äôs like reheating leftovers and calling it a new dish. Sure, it‚Äôs convenient, but the flavor doesn‚Äôt quite wow you. If developers lean too heavily on AI, the industry risks becoming a recycling bin of old ideas, with little room for genuine innovation.
3. **The Decline of Human Skills** As AI takes over tasks like modeling, coding, and even voice acting, developers might slowly lose the hands-on expertise needed for those jobs. It‚Äôs a bit like how GPS made people lose their sense of direction‚Äîover-reliance can lead to atrophy. If this continues, crafting a unique, hand-made character model might one day become a lost art.
4. **The Legal and Ethical Minefield** Is AI-generated content truly original? Who owns it? These questions remain murky. Many AI tools are trained on pre-existing works, often without the creators‚Äô explicit consent. This has already sparked debates about intellectual property and ownership. For artists who spent years creating their work, seeing AI ""borrow"" it for new creations can feel like theft.

**So, How Can AI Spark Creativity Instead?**

The good news is, AI doesn‚Äôt have to be our rival‚Äîit can be our collaborator. If used wisely, AI can actually help us unlock more imaginative possibilities. Here‚Äôs how to make AI a ""creative rocket booster"" instead of a ""creativity vacuum"":

1. **Human-AI Collaboration: Let AI Handle the Dirty Work** Think of AI as the diligent intern who tackles all the boring, repetitive tasks‚Äîlike generating maps or filling in basic NPC dialogues. This leaves developers free to focus on crafting the memorable ""wow moments."" For instance, the procedural generation in *No Man‚Äôs Sky* laid the groundwork for a vast universe, but the designers hand-picked the most striking elements to give the game its magic.
2. **Quick Prototyping: The Savior of Trial and Error** With AI, you can create a game prototype with just a few text prompts‚Äîlike waving a magic wand to bring your sketch to life. Even if an idea doesn‚Äôt work out, you haven‚Äôt wasted months or drained your budget. AI helps you fail faster and move on to the next great concept, making experimentation less costly.
3. **Custom-Tailored Player Experiences** AI can generate personalized missions, adjust difficulty in real-time, or cater to different player styles. It‚Äôs like having a game that knows when to hand you a cup of coffee and when to push you to sprint. This level of personalization keeps players engaged and opens up creative possibilities for game mechanics.
4. **Breaking Cultural Barriers** AI‚Äôs translation capabilities act as a ""universal language"" in the gaming world, allowing players from different countries to team up seamlessly. For example, *Evony* uses an AI-driven auto-translation system to break language barriers, enabling global player interaction. This doesn‚Äôt just make games more inclusive‚Äîit also allows developers to reach a wider audience.
5. **Freeing Up Creativity: Focus on What Matters** AI is like a food processor in the kitchen‚Äîit handles the chopping, so you can focus on perfecting the dish. By taking over repetitive tasks, AI gives developers more time to focus on storytelling, character design, and emotional resonance. The soul of a game still comes from humans, while AI simply speeds up the path to realizing that vision.

# Finding Balance: How to Avoid Letting AI Become a ""Creativity Vacuum""?

To make sure AI enhances creativity instead of stifling it, studios need to strike a balance. Here‚Äôs a ""how-to guide"" for using AI effectively:

* **Define Roles for AI and Humans:** Let AI handle repetitive, technical tasks while humans focus on creative elements like narrative design, world-building, and visual style.
* **Encourage Original Thinking:** Use AI as a tool for experimentation, not as a shortcut. Push your team to explore new ideas instead of rehashing existing ones.
* **Embrace Ethical Transparency:** Ensure that AI-generated content is ethically sourced and communicate clearly to players how AI is used in the game. This builds trust and avoids backlash.
* **Foster Continuous Learning:** Developers should learn how to collaborate with AI while also honing their own skills. For example, artists can refine AI-generated models, adding the human touch that makes them stand out.

**Conclusion: The ""Golden Duo"" of AI and Human Creativity**

AI in game development can be both a ""lubricant"" for workflows and a potential ""speed bump"" for innovation. It has the power to make processes faster, deliver personalized experiences, and open up new creative avenues. But without careful management, it risks making games feel formulaic and even eroding essential human skills.

The key is how we choose to use AI. If we see it as a guide and collaborator rather than a replacement for human imagination, it can push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in gaming. The best games of the future will be the result of a partnership between AI‚Äôs efficiency and human creativity. After all, what touches us most is not the cold calculation of a machine, but the unique spark of human imagination that no algorithm can replicate.",1,1735628850.0,davidmatrix,0,1.0,False

-------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to creating a warm and inviting space, the combination of beige and wood stands out as one of the most captivating choices in interior design. This pairing provides a perfect harmony, embracing both minimalist and rustic aesthetics. Let's dive into the reasons why this duo is more than just a trend and how it can breathe life into your living space.

### The Warmth of Beige

Beige serves as a soft, neutral canvas, making it a popular choice for interior walls, furniture, and accessories. Its versatile nature allows it to blend seamlessly with a variety of color palettes. Some key benefits of using beige in design include:

- **Versatility:** Beige pairs well with bold colors and patterns, ensuring that you can create a stunning focal point without overwhelming the space.
- **Light Reflection:** The light tones of beige help in reflecting natural light, making rooms feel more spacious and airy.
- **Timeless Appeal:** Beige never goes out of style and can adapt easily to changing trends.

### Embracing Wood Elements

Wood adds texture and warmth to any interior. Its natural beauty creates an organic feel that can transform a sterile environment into a cozy sanctuary. Here‚Äôs how wood complements beige:

- **Natural Warmth:** The rich textures and hues of wood enhance the warmth of beige, providing a welcoming atmosphere.
- **Contrast of Tones:** Different wood finishes, from light oak to dark walnut, offer a pleasing contrast to beige, enriching your design.
- **Eco-Friendly Choices:** Many wood products hail from sustainable sources, making them an environmentally friendly option for conscious consumers.

### Creating Balance in Design

To achieve artistic harmony with beige and wood, consider the following strategies:

- **Layer Textures:** Mix different textures like plush beige fabrics with raw wooden surfaces. This layering adds depth and interest to your space.
- **Accent Pieces:** Incorporate wooden furniture pieces, such as a coffee table or shelves, against beige walls or upholstery for an elegant touch.
- **Area Rugs:** Choose a soft beige area rug to ground the space while allowing wooden floors to shine through.

### Exploring Color Palettes

Combining beige and wood doesn‚Äôt have to stop there; they can serve as a base for more vibrant color schemes. Here are some colors that work beautifully alongside beige and wood:

- **Greens:** Shades of olive and sage enhance the earthy feel.
- **Blues:** Light blues can evoke a calming atmosphere, perfect for bedrooms and bathrooms.
- **Grays:** Adding gray tones can modernize the look, offering sophistication and style.

### Practical Applications

Implementing beige and wood in your home can be both simple and effective. Here are some practical applications:

- **Living Rooms:** Use a beige sofa paired with a reclaimed wood coffee table and wood accent decor.
- **Bedrooms:** Choose beige bedding and wooden nightstands to create a serene retreat.
- **Kitchens:** Opt for beige cabinetry with a natural wood countertop for a fresh, airy feel.


Should you choose to explore the aesthetic appeal of beige and wood in interior design, the result is often a harmonious balance that brings out the best in your living spaces. This timeless duo goes beyond mere decoration; it tells a story of warmth and connection with nature. By integrating these elements thoughtfully, you can craft a home that is not only beautiful but also welcoming. So, are you ready to embrace the perfect harmony of beige and wood in your home?

The Psychological Impact of Neutral Tones and Natural Materials on Home Environments
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a home environment that feels inviting and serene often begins with the colors and materials we choose. Neutral tones, particularly beige, combined with natural materials like wood, play a significant role in crafting spaces that promote well-being. This combination can create a balance that positively influences your mood and mental state.

The use of neutral colors such as beige offers a calming backdrop, making it easier for you to relax after a hectic day. These tones do not overpower the senses; instead, they provide a gentle visual experience that can enhance feelings of tranquility. Beige, in particular, is known for its warm and earthy qualities, which can evoke comfort and familiarity. This soft color encourages peace in your home, allowing you to unwind.

Additionally, when combined with natural materials like wood, the effect is amplified. Wood brings an organic element into your space, connecting you with nature. Psychologically, this connection can reduce stress levels and enhance your mood. Studies have shown that being around natural elements can evoke feelings of happiness and well-being. Therefore, incorporating wood into your interior design, whether through furniture or flooring, creates a harmonious atmosphere that complements the soft neutrality of beige.

There are several benefits to using neutral tones and natural materials in home spaces:

- **Calming Effect:** Both beige and wood are known for their calming properties. They create a serene and peaceful environment where you can feel at ease.
- **Versatility:** Neutral tones work well with various design styles, allowing you to create a cohesive look without feeling confined to one aesthetic.
- **Timelessness:** Beige and wood elements are classic choices that will never go out of style. They can adapt as your tastes evolve without requiring a complete redesign of your space.
- **Enhanced Focus:** A neutral palette can help declutter your mind, making it easier for you to concentrate and be productive when working from home.
- **Improved Well-Being:** Studies suggest that natural materials can lead to decreased anxiety levels and improved overall mood, which ultimately contributes to a better quality of life.

Enhancing your living space with beige and wood can also foster social interactions. A warm, inviting environment encourages family and friends to gather. When guests feel comfortable, it can lead to more meaningful connections and shared experiences. The ambiance created by these elements invites conversations and laughter, enriching your social life and mental well-being.

Moreover, the choice of furniture plays a crucial role. Selecting wooden pieces with soft beige upholstery can provide the ultimate comfort and visual appeal. Think about a cozy beige sofa complemented by a rich oak coffee table. This combination not only looks aesthetically pleasing but also creates an inviting area for family gatherings or quiet moments with a book.

Lighting can further enhance the effects of beige and wood within your home. Natural light amplifies the warmth of these colors, making the interiors feel airy and spacious. When possible, use sheer curtains to allow sunlight to filter through, highlighting the grain of wooden walls or furniture. For evenings, consider soft, warm lighting that mimics the hues of sunset, bringing an additional layer of comfort and relaxation.

Another consideration is incorporating plants into your design. The addition of greenery can bridge the gap between the neutral tones and natural materials, adding a vibrant layer of life. Plants not only purify the air but also create an invigorating connection with nature, enhancing your overall emotional state. A small potted plant on a wooden shelf can bring an area to life without overwhelming the simplicity of beige hues.

Remember that maintaining a clutter-free space is essential when working with neutral tones. A minimalistic approach can help your home feel organized and peaceful. Embrace natural materials in d√©cor items, such as ceramic vases or woven baskets, to enhance the aesthetic while ensuring everything has a place.

Beige and wood into your home environment can significantly impact your psychological well-being. By opting for these soothing colors and natural materials, you create a harmonious, inviting space that promotes relaxation, connection, and happiness. Embrace the beauty of simplicity and see how it transforms your everyday life.

### Conclusion

Creating a warm and inviting space often relies on the colors and materials chosen for interiors. The combination of beige and wood has proven to be a powerful design choice that can elevate homes to a new level of comfort and style. The aesthetic appeal of this pairing cannot be overstated; beige, with its soft, neutral tones, beautifully complements the organic textures of wood, resulting in a serene and cohesive design scheme. Whether you are selecting beige paint, light fabrics, or wooden furniture, each element works in harmony, offering a timeless look that suits various design styles.

Furthermore, the psychological impact of neutral tones like beige, alongside the natural warmth of wood, enhances the atmosphere of your home. These elements promote feelings of calm and stability, creating a space where you can truly unwind after a long day. Homes designed with these materials not only appeal visually but also foster a positive emotional environment, making them a haven for relaxation.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Tolva, Venlil, Colonial Cultural Ambassador (sheriff appointed) - Human exchange program participant**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: July 15, 2139*

======

Me and Helin were sat on the couch under the blankets, our bowls which previously held our frozen treats were set down on the coffee table in front of us and both of us were tapping away at our pads.

‚ÄúGylen and Phyli will be home in about 9 paws,‚Äù Helin said quietly as she set her pad down.

It should have been good news, but her tone, ears, and tail communicated only apprehension and worry.

‚ÄúIs there something wrong with that?‚Äù I asked before playfully adding, ‚ÄúOther than it not being sooner, of course,‚Äù

\>thanks for the attempt< was all I got for trying to lift the mood

I gave a concerned tilt of my ears and gently patted her back with my tail, >what‚Äôs wrong?<

‚ÄúI... I wonder if... If maybe me and Gylen shouldn‚Äôt move to his home town on Skelga,‚Äù

I was more than a little surprised to hear this, she had always been rather proud of our home and had always insisted that she had no desire to live on a bigger colony or on Skelga.

\>Why? What‚Äôs wrong?<

Maybe it‚Äôs... Maybe it‚Äôs too dangerous here. Phantoms and... and... She looked to her pad and curled in on herself a little, ‚ÄúI... Dema confirmed everything you said. About the Predator Watch and about Pahlo... I... It‚Äôs just so insane, I can‚Äôt wrap my head around it,‚Äù

‚ÄúI... Honestly I felt the same way, but... after thinking about it for a little bit, I... I think it makes some sense,‚Äù

Helin frowned and looked at me with a tilt of her ears and a curious flick of her tail >What?<

‚ÄúI mean... You remember Corlin, right?‚Äù

Helin blinked a few times as she seemed to search her memory, ‚Äúoh! Yes, he was our neighbor when we were little, right?‚Äù

I nodded, ‚ÄúHe... Remember after Orva was... was killed, not a month later the Exterminators said he had PD and they took him away?‚Äù

Helin‚Äôs expression sank a little >yeah<

‚ÄúWell... I... I thought about it alot after the news about PD not being real. He hardly left his house and was angry and got in fights and was mean to everyone in his herd until they stopped talking to him and... and,‚Äù I sighed, feelings of shame and remorse welling up inside even though I was only a pup at the time and couldn‚Äôt possible have done anything even if I wasn‚Äôt sick every other week at that age, ‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt ‚Äòinfected‚Äô with anything, he was sad and angry and hurting. He lost his wife and their unborn pup,‚Äù

Helin looked down a little, ‚ÄúI think mom had said almost the same thing before he was taken,‚Äù

‚ÄúSee?!‚Äù

\>what?<

‚ÄúMom was a good person, everyone always said so and they still say so. Even the rest of his herd kept trying to visit even though he was angry and mean to them. Good people *knew* that he needed support and kindness. But the Exterminators dragged him out of his house in the middle of the night and... and shipped him off to a PD treatment facility,‚Äù I explained, ‚ÄúGood people wouldn‚Äôt do that,‚Äù

Helin considered this for a few moments before nodding slowly, >That makes sense. I think you‚Äôre right<

I nodded and let my focus wander around the hab for a moment before something occurred to me, ‚Äúyou know... maybe... maybe you should try getting to know Elanor a little?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Helin shot me a disparaging look >smooth<, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you just give it a rest on trying to sell me on your pre- *human* friend?‚Äù

\>how dare?< I signaled sarcastically with a giggle, ‚ÄúNo, I mean that if you‚Äôre really thinking about moving to Skelga, you should get more used to humans first. There‚Äôs a lot of human refugees there. I‚Äôve heard that there‚Äôs even Arxur living on Skelga now,‚Äù

That darn near made her jump out of her wool, ‚ÄúWHAT!?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, here,‚Äù I pulled up a Bleat I had saved. It depicted a selfie in front of some kind of dance club by a Venlil with rather... uh, garishly dyed wool who was also wearing a variety of beads and -what I assume were- clip on jewelry for their ears, lip, and tongue. The main focus of the selfie wasn‚Äôt actually the person taking it, but the tall, rather intimidating figure of what -even with the censor bar over its eyes and face and much of them obscured in harsh shadows cast by colorful lighting of the sign above- was clearly an Arxur wearing a black jacket that said ‚Äòbouncer‚Äô on it.

She looked at it in disbelief and mouthed one of the hashtags, ‚Äòpredatorkisser‚Äô, with shock and revulsion in equal parts. She let out a groan and buried her face in her paws, ‚ÄúFine, ok, maybe not Skelga,‚Äù

I laughed and gave her a reassuring pat on the back with my tail, ‚ÄúLook, If nothing else and regardless of how I feel about him, Rahlo has already completely outmaneuvered and out-played the Predator Watch *and* there were far, far fewer predator attacks back when he was in charge of the exterminators than after Pahlo took over. I‚Äôm sure things are going to settle down around here now,‚Äù

She sighed >you‚Äôre probably right<

\*Rrr-Bing! Rrr-Bing!\*

Helin looked down to her pad as it started to ring and I saw that it was Berra as she tapped the answer button.

‚ÄúBerra,‚Äù Helin greeted with surprise, ‚ÄúIs... Is Camli ok?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe... She‚Äôll live and they won‚Äôt need to amputate,‚Äù Berra replied, sounding very tired, ‚ÄúWhat about you and Tolva, are you both ok?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe-... We‚Äôre fine. I‚Äôm safe thanks to Mr. Thomas and Tolva was in his human‚Äôs hab,‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to hear it... Listen, if it‚Äôs not too much to ask, I‚Äôd like to stay overnight here in the clinic. Would you be alright looking after Danly?‚Äù

Danly and Phyli were both about the same age so they had frequent play dates, so I suppose it would make sense that her first call would be to Helin.

‚ÄúUh yeah, yeah that... that‚Äôd be fine. I‚Äôm at the humans hab, but I-‚Äù

‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs even better!‚Äù Berra remarked with a sigh of relief, ‚ÄúHave her walk you over to pick up Danly, he should be in the safe room,‚Äù

‚ÄúWh-what?‚Äù

Berra looked a little guilty on the pad, ‚ÄúI- I know that I shouldn‚Äôt have just left him there on his own, but I needed to go with Camli and he‚Äôs very good at looking after himself and I didn‚Äôt want to bring him out of the safe room until we got the all clear,‚Äù

‚ÄúN-no, I understand that, but... a-are you sure you want a pre- human around Danly?‚Äù

Berra laughed pretty hard hearing that, ‚ÄúOh Helin, you silly girl. I was in the first wave of Exchange program volunteers, remember? Obviously not all humans are saints like some speh brains on Bleat seem to think, but that Elanor saved Camli and Rahlo trusts her, that‚Äôs enough for me,‚Äù

‚ÄúR-right,‚Äù >I guess that makes sense<

‚ÄúI‚Äôd feel much better if she accompanied you and Danly, I saw her in action and I know she‚Äôll keep you both safe. Plus it‚Äôs a shorter walk to her hab than your house,‚Äù

Helin fidgeted apprehensively a moment before letting out a defeated sigh, ‚ÄúOk, yeah, I... I‚Äôll do that. You just make sure that Camli doesn‚Äôt give Himal too hard of a time, ok?‚Äù

Berra laughed again, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try, but I think that‚Äôs up to him and how much he‚Äôs actually improved his stitch work,‚Äù

Helin giggled >Good bye, stay safe<

\>you too<

I let Helin stare down at her pad in silence for a few long moments before clearing my throat, ‚Äúdo you want me to go ask Elanor for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúAsk me what?‚Äù

Both me and Helin jumped a little as Elanor emerged from behind from and hallway to my right.¬†

Elanor winced slightly with a very guilty looking expression, ‚Äúuh, sorry, I didn‚Äôt mean to startle you,‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù I reassured earnestly her before giggling a little, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only fair with how much I seem to sneak up on you,‚Äù

Elanor giggled and I felt my tail wag happily at the sound, quickly making me bloom lightly as I saw the dubious look Helin adopted at our exchange.

I cleared my throat and flicked an ear towards Elanor, ‚ÄúUh, Elanor? Berra, Camli‚Äôs wife, asked Helin to look after their son, Danly while she‚Äôs in the clinic with Camli. Berra said that she would feel more comfortable if you went with Elanor to pick him up since the all-clear announcement hasn‚Äôt actually been made yet,‚Äù

Elanor‚Äôs eyes went wide, ‚Äúwhat!? How old is he? Has he been there alone this whole time!?‚Äù

I flicked my other ear towards my sister, ‚ÄúUh, he‚Äôs a little over 2 cycles now, right? A little older than Phyli,‚Äù

Helin nodded a little, still trying very hard to avoid looking at Elanor‚Äôs bare face.

The human herself went slack jawed at what had just told her, ‚ÄúOh my god! sheesh, yeah let‚Äôs go get the little guy, he must be so scared!‚Äù She said urgently as she hurried to the tiled area in front of the door and started putting on her boots.

I gave Helin a nudge with my tail when I noticed that she hadn‚Äôt budged from under the blanket >go on!<

She gave me a pleading look >Come with?<

I giggled and hefted the heavy blanket off of my lap before standing, ‚ÄúWell come on then,‚Äù I teased, ‚Äúyour little bro will keep you safe from the scary human,‚Äù

Helin bloomed orange which brought a smirk to my face that vanished rather quickly as I noticed the slightly guilty and disheartened expression Elanor gave in our direction.

I gave a small sigh and shook my head before gently ushering Helin along.

I made sure to put on my mask before walking Tolva and Helin back to the same house I had just gotten into a shoot out at. There was still a disquieting amount of orange painting where the phantoms had savaged and dragged their victim. Both Helin and Tolva noticed it too and turned their heads the other way to avoid seeing it. I also saw a few bits of metal here or there from the predator watch guys‚Äô flamethrowers, one of which I picked up from the sidewalk and chucked into a garbage bin just so no one would step on it.

When we got to the front door I stood back alongside Tolva as Helin walked to the front door and keyed in a code before entering. We had walked the entire short distance in silence and all three of us were on high alert just in case any of the things were still snooping around, so I was a little startled when Tolva suddenly started speaking.

‚ÄúYou should know- \*hehe\* *you‚Äôre* not supposed be the jumpy one right now,‚Äù Tolva said with a small laugh though I could tell by the way his ears were swiveling that he was still quite on edge himself, ‚Äúa-anyway, You should know that Danly can‚Äôt talk,‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, you did say he‚Äôs only two,‚Äù

Tolva chuckled and shook his head, ‚Äúno, I mean he *can‚Äôt* talk. He‚Äôs really smart and observant. Like *really*, really. But I guess he had some kind of complication before he was born and- uh, well in Camli‚Äôs words: the part of his brain that‚Äôs responsible for converting thoughts into speech is almost entirely undeveloped. So he communicates only in tail-language.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs good to know,‚Äù I remarked with a nod, ‚Äúuh... wait, does he have the translator or is he too young?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs implanted at age two normally, so he‚Äôll be able to-‚Äù

Tolva was cut off and gave a loud, frightened bleat as I grabbed him and yanked him around my side. At the same time I kicked forward towards where he had been standing and my bottom of my boot connected hard with a faint shimmer in the air which flashed into a dazzling array of light like a sun catcher, revealing a bestial snarling head as the impact momentarily set the Phantom‚Äôs scales out of their alignment.

In a flash I drew and fired my revolver, the deafening bang echoed along the row of houses as the massive .504 bullet painted the sidewalk with magenta viscera. I saw another shimmer out of the corner of my eye but it vanished around the corner before I could draw a bead on it.

*Were they looking for the missing pack members?*

***Is that really what‚Äôs important right now?***

*Wha- oh shit! Tolva!*

I looked back towards the little guy who was squatting down with his hands over the side of his head covering his ears, his whole body was drawn tight and trembling with terror. I wanted so badly to hug him and tell him that it was all over and that he was safe, but that‚Äôd be a lie. I had no idea if there was still a danger or not. I‚Äôd think that logically they would retreat, having now lost three of their number, but I didn‚Äôt know a damn thing about them.

Instead I just reached down and picked Tolva up, holding him under my arm like a football as I yelled for Helin to open the door and let Tolva in.

The door opened a tiny crack and I caught just a glimpse of Helin‚Äôs terrified expression before I turned to look back to make sure nothing was sneaking up on me.¬†

I took a half step back towards the door and set Tolva down just inside it, ‚ÄúClose the door and keep it closed for now, I‚Äôm going to go make sure that there aren‚Äôt any more,‚Äù I said without looking

‚ÄúW-w-w-wa-wait! E-El-Elanor, it‚Äôs n-not s-safe!‚Äù Tolva‚Äôs teeth were chattering so much that the Translator actually lagged slightly as struggled to translate his words.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine,‚Äù I reassured him, ‚Äúyou two stay inside,‚Äù

Helin closed the door before Tolva could try and stammer out an argument and I set off to do a quick lap of the house.¬†

All of the windows and doors seemed to be intact so at the very least I was confident that nothing had broken in. As I looked up and down the predator fence I spotted something that stood out. A mound of dirt piled up on either side of the fence perhaps four houses down, two past my own hab.

*Holy shit, don‚Äôt tell me.*

I cautiously walked down along the fence until I came to the spot in question and, sure enough, there was a perhaps two foot divot dug under the fence.

*How does this thing not have a concrete foundation!?*

I took a moment to look up and down the fence again and realized that there actually *was* a foundation, but for some reason this spot right here had a perhaps three foot gap. Actually, looking at it, it almost looked like this section was once a door. The posts were evenly spaced every 3 meters or so but in this one spot where there was a break in the foundation two were placed only a few feet apart.

I heard the sound of something walking on grass and saw movement out of the corner of my eye. I snapped my head in that direction, making a poor unfortunate Venlil jump almost a full foot with the sudden movement.

The fur on his arms, face and ears was a sandy tan while his wool was a sort of creamy off white and it was cut uniformly and almost as short as Tolva‚Äôs wool. This was probably so he could more easily wear his uniform, which seemed to be similar to Rahlo‚Äôs though it had the addition of what looked like riot gear over the top of it. Rather than a laser rifle as I understood Venlil to commonly use, he was holding a *very* familiar looking rifle. It wasn‚Äôt a military rifle, but rather a semi-auto large-game rifle chambered in .45-70.

*Wait is* ***THAT*** *what the Grizzly Arms UN contracts were for? Outfitting the ‚Äòwildlife management office‚Äô or whatever? That... huh, yeah I guess it really was for space bears. Huh.*

‚ÄúS-sorry, didn‚Äôt mean to scare you,‚Äù I tried to say it apologetically, but what came out was a guilty sounding murmur.

The Venlil flicked his tail in what I‚Äôm pretty sure was meant to be some kind of ‚Äòdon‚Äôt worry about it‚Äô or something before clearing his throat and stepping closer, ‚ÄúSo this is where they got in over here?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt looks like it, have you checked on Camli‚Äôs house Tolva and-‚Äù

‚ÄúTolva and Helin are both fine, I checked on them first,‚Äù he interrupted with a small wave of his tail, ‚ÄúAnyway, I‚Äôm deputy Barni. Uh, well.. For now anyway,‚Äù

I frowned, ‚ÄúFor now?‚Äù

He nodded, ‚ÄúRahlo is reassigning a bunch of us to work in the wildlife management office,‚Äù I‚Äôm pretty sure the way his tail moved as he said that indicated he wasn‚Äôt entirely pleased with this, but honestly I‚Äôm not sure.

‚ÄúI see... w-well It seems that you‚Äôre better equipped for the job at hand than the ‚Äòpredator watch‚Äô at least,‚Äù

‚ÄúI hope so,‚Äù Barni mumbled as his ear twitched and his attention was drawn to the fence for a few moments, ‚ÄúI guess... I guess I‚Äôll wait here for backup to arrive and then we‚Äôll figure out a shift rotation for guarding this spot and the one we found by the shuttleport. You should go back to Helin and Tolva,‚Äù

I nodded, glad I to have been given out before the compulsion to start some kind of awkward small talk took over.

I jogged back down the block to where I had parted ways with Tolva and Helin and as soon as I approached the front door it flew open and a soft missile of black fluff shot straight at me, leaping from the top of the three small steps and clinging to my waist.

‚ÄúT-Tolva? Watch the claws, please,‚Äù I cooed softly in a playful tone as I picked him up under the arms.

As I brought him up his paws shot out again and he hugged me around the neck as tightly as his little, trembling arms could manage. I realized then that his face was wet with tears and I felt a small flutter of panic, ‚ÄúA-are you ok? Are you hurt anywhere? I-I didn‚Äôt grab you hard, did I?‚Äù

‚ÄúH-he‚Äôs just scared... and glad you‚Äôre ok,‚Äù Helium remarked somewhat nervously as she stepped out of the door, her ears and boxy pupils scanning all around for any sign of anything else that might jump out at them.

Behind her was... was... the cutest goddamned thing I had ever seen! The little pup was maybe two feet tall and change? His wool looked like it was of moderate length, not as short as Tolva‚Äôs but nowhere near as fluffy as Helin. The fur on his face and ears was black while his wool seemed equal parts black and white giving him a very striking salt and pepper grey sort of appearance. His wool also had a remarkable sheen to it and it seemed less tightly curled and more drawn out compared to what I had seen thus far. Springy, I guess I would describe it. Springy and very soft looking. And his *eyes* my god! A very pale but vibrant aquamarine that brought to mind moonlight.

He was practically glued to Helin‚Äôs side, reaching up to hold on tightly to her wool as he looked up at me with obvious curiosity and maybe a bit of wonder.

I blinked dumbly behind my mask a few times as I stared down at him, utterly stunned by the adorable little floof, before I managed to shake my head and bring myself back to reality, ‚Äúwe should hurry back to my place,‚Äù

Helin seemed rather taken aback by this, ‚ÄúY-your place?‚Äù

I nodded as I gently stroked Tolva‚Äôs back. He was still shivering rather violently and hadn‚Äôt made a single sound beyond the occasional small whimper, ‚Äúwe barely managed the trip here before we were ambushed, so I‚Äôd rather you stay at my hab until the all clear is sounded officially, ok?‚Äù

She clearly wanted to dispute this, it was painfully obvious even with my lack of understanding of Venlil tail-language, but she also couldn‚Äôt seem to find a counter argument, ‚ÄúI-I... o-ok..‚Äù she muttered quietly after a moment of desperately searching for one.

The walk back to my hab was a short and uneventful one, I took up the rear carrying Tolva and Helin carried little Danly.

Taking off my boots was made slightly more complicated by the fact that Tolva was absolutely locked around my neck the entire time, but once I got them off I carried him to the couch and sat down on the far cushion closest to the window, keeping my mask on for the sake of Danly and Helin.

I gently stroked Tolva‚Äôs back and the top of his head for a few minutes until he finally calmed down enough to let go and wipe the tears from his eyes, ‚ÄúI-I W-w-was s-s-so scared,‚Äù he stammered

My heart ached as I looked down into his big amber eyes, ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I cooed softly, ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok now,‚Äù

He nodded and cleared his throat a little as he tried to regain some composure, ‚ÄúP-please d-don‚Äôt do that anymore,‚Äù

I froze.

*Oh no, no, no did-did* ***I*** *scare him? Did I grab him to hard? Did I-*

‚ÄúY-you need to be s-safe too,‚Äù Tolva interrupted my growing panic, wiping his eyes again with the back of his paw, ‚Äú*please* d-don‚Äôt run off like that a-anymore, ok?‚Äù

I blinked a few times, completely dumbstruck before hugging him snuggly against me again. He nuzzled into my neck and made a small trilling sound for a few moments before pushing away and clearing his throat again.

I giggled as I noticed how tinged with orange his face and ears were as he climbed down from my lap on the cushion next to me, ‚ÄúA-any way... it-it‚Äôs a good thing that you came along... right Helin?‚Äù

Helin stiffened a little as her name was mentioned, her ears lowering slightly as she turned her head a bit to look back at me and Tolva from where she was sitting on the carpet with Danly, ‚ÄúI... yes... you‚Äôre right,‚Äù she said with a small and apprehensive sigh, ‚ÄúThank you, Elanor.‚Äù

I smiled behind the mask, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad I was there to help,‚Äù

Helin sighed again and I noticed then that Danly was poking his little head out around her fluff, and seemed to have one of his pretty aquamarine eyes focused square on me.

‚ÄúHi there, cutie pie,‚Äù I said with a small smile as I gave a little wave in greeting.

He looked at his tiny little paw a moment before returning the wave and shyly ducking a little more behind Helin.

I giggled before lightly clapping my hands together, ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôm going to make some dinner,‚Äù I announced as I stood and walked into the kitchen.

Tolva followed after me, climbing up into one of the tall chairs and watching with interest as I pulled various pans out of the cabinets and set them on the stove before pulling a wide array of ingredients out of the fridge and setting them up on the high top counter where he sat.

I washed my hands and put on a pair of black gloves before grabbing a knife from the cutlery block next to the fridge. Helin yelped and scooted back, holding Danly defensively as I turned around with the knife in hand, ‚ÄúIt... It‚Äôs just a kitchen knife,‚Äù I remarked with confusion and a little bit of sorrow that she seemed to still trust me so little.

‚ÄúA- Wha- Why would you need something like that!?‚Äù She demanded in accusatory tone

*Huh? Is she serious?*

‚ÄúFor... cutting up the ingredients? Do... wait do you guys really not cut *any* of the fruits or vegetables that you eat?‚Äù

‚ÄúN-not with anything like *that*!‚Äù she exclaimed

‚ÄúI...‚Äù I sighed and shook my head, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a\~ oh... ohhh.‚Äù

I laughed and she gave me a very suspect look, scooting back a bit more.

I slipped off one of my gloves and held up my hand, ‚ÄúSee how big my hands are?‚Äù I placed the hand atop Tolva‚Äôs head, getting a small \*beep\* which made me giggle again, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a Tolva for scale,‚Äù

Helin seemed rather confused and a little worried for her brother now but nodded slowly, ‚Äúo-ok?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right that it is a very large knife,‚Äù I remarked with a nod as I walked back to the sink and washed my hands again before putting another pair of gloves on, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs just an ordinary kitchen knife that‚Äôs been scaled up to be easier for me to use,‚Äù

‚ÄúI... I see. I suppose that that makes some sense,‚Äù Helin admitted

I nodded and returned the ingredients, picking the knife back up, ‚ÄúIf you have any more questions or concerns, just feel free to ask.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat... what are you making?‚Äù she asked suspiciously

‚ÄúUh... hmm... Well, it‚Äôs a bean, rice, and veggie fajita recipe.\~\~‚Äù I began after thinking of how to describe it.

Over the next fifteen minutes I explained all of the ingredients to both Tolva and Helin as I narrated my way through the entire cooking process and recipe. Poblano peppers, long grain rice, tomato paste, black olives, bell peppers, refried beans, and large capped portobello mushrooms. Apparently mushrooms were not something that either of them had ever eaten, something which not only surprised me but led to a couple minute detour of me looking up if they were even safe for Venlil to eat. Thankfully they were, but I guess that fungi aren‚Äôt something that most Venlil would ever think of eating.

*Could have mentioned that when I ran the recipe past you, Neliv!*

After finishing it all up I made up a pair of fajitas for both Tolva and Helin and cut a pair of shells down to make mini ones for Danly. I then took a moment to lightly crisp up the top and bottoms of them in the pan I had fried the veggies in before plating them up and setting the trio of plates on the counter. With a satisfied nod and a smile behind my mask.

‚ÄúAaaand done.‚Äù I said triumphantly¬†

Tolva eyed it curiously a moment before picking up one of the fajitas in his paws and bringing it to his mouth. All it took was one bite for his eyes to go wide.

‚ÄúOh. My. Stars. Elanor, this is ***SO BRAHKING GOOD!*****‚Äù** He proclaimed before quickly taking another bite, ‚Äú*sooo* good,‚Äù

I blushed under my mask and felt a fluttery feeling in my chest. I only very rarely got a chance to cook for people and... sharing a recipe that Torry had taught me felt nice.

Helin seemed quite a bit more hesitant to try the offered food, but before she could stop him Danly rushed up and started trying to climb up onto the chair where his plate was. I giggled as Tolva helped him up, ‚Äúsomeone‚Äôs hungry,‚Äù

His ears and tail did a bit of waggling as he picked up one of the mini fajitas and bit into it, his eyes going wide just as Tolva‚Äôs had.

Tolva laughed, ‚Äúhe says, ‚Äòthank you for the food‚Äô,‚Äù He translated for me as the pup‚Äôs ears swished about emphatically.

‚ÄúWell you‚Äôre very welcome, I‚Äôm glad you like it.‚Äù I replied with a warm smile behind my mask

His ears and tail did more wiggling and Tolva further translated, ‚Äúhe also says ‚Äòthank you for saving mommy Camli from the monster and mommy Berra from the predator watch‚Äô,‚Äù

I felt a little bashful and warm as I nodded, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just glad I could help,‚Äù

His ears and tail kept moving but Tolva gave him a lopsided frown and plaintively remarked, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt eat and tell Elanor what you‚Äôre saying at the same time, you know.‚Äù

Danly‚Äôs face turned a little pouty but he seemed content to just eat.

I laughed and made myself a pair of large fajitas with the remaining ingredients. When I turned back I was surprised to find that Helin had climbed up into the chair next to Danly where I had set her plate and was eyeing the food with an hesitant expression.

I lifted my mask a little and took a big bite of my own food, smiling a little as the taste reminded me of the first time Torry had cooked for me. He had been so worried that I wouldn‚Äôt like it, given how much my family hunts, and so unbelievably proud of himself when I did.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not poisoned, I promise,‚Äù I reassured Helin who nodded before slowly and very, very hesitantly picking up one of her fajitas and taking a small bite.

The effects were immediate as her eyes went even wider than Tolva or Danly‚Äôs had. They practically sparkled with wonder as she looked down at the bite she had taken out of it in apparent disbelief.

Tolva smirked smugly, ‚ÄúWell?‚Äù

‚ÄúI-It‚Äôs good... very good,‚Äù Helin said bashfully as she took another bite.

We all ate in relative silence and when we were finished I put all the dishes in the dishwasher and rummaged around in the freezer for a few seconds before pulling out a quartet of freezie pops from the box inside. I snipped the tops off of them with a scissor and handed one to each of the Venlil still sitting at the counter who all looked at them curiously.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs frozen fruit juice,‚Äù I explained, ‚Äúif you pinch at the bottom like this\~ it will push a little out of the top and you can nibble it off. My mother and father used to get these for us every summer,‚Äù

Having already experienced sorbetto, Helin was far less hesitant to try this then she was the fajita and her tail flicked happily as she tasted the cherry flavored ice treat.

Danly was especially enthralled by it, pushing out maybe an inch at a time and sucking the juice out of it before biting off the ice. His tail wagged happily the whole time and when he was done he looked up at me and both his ears and tail flicked around expressively along with some gestures from his paws.

‚ÄúHe says that you make really good food,‚Äù Helin supplied before giving a small smile despite herself, ‚Äúand asks if you‚Äôd be able to teach one of his mommies how to make yummy things like that,‚Äù

I giggled and smiled ear to ear behind my mask, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be happy to, little one,‚Äù

He seemed quite pleased with this and conversed with Helin and Tolva both for a moment.

‚ÄúUh, would it be alright if he used the bed in the guest room?‚Äù Tovla asked

‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù Reapplied cheerily

Helin seemed significantly less than thrilled about this, ‚ÄúBut... I-I...‚Äù

‚ÄúHelin,‚Äù Tolva said with a heavy sigh before puffing up his chest a little, ‚ÄúI get that Elanor is big and strong and I can understand if you want her to keep her mask on. But she‚Äôs saved me and Camli, she‚Äôs given us delicious food, and hasn‚Äôt hurt anyone except for a speh brain that was trying to kill her and another speh brain that would have gotten Camli killed if he got his way. At this point you‚Äôre just being *rude*,‚Äù

I wondered if maybe the translator had hitched somehow because for some reason the word ‚Äòrude‚Äô seemed to have a profound effect on her. She looked to her brother with shock and after a moment she hung her head and her ears and tail drooped a little, suddenly seeming to be overcome with both shame and remorse.¬†

Danly put his little paw on her arm and waggled her ears and she perked back up a tad before nodding and giving a small sigh, ‚Äúy-.... You‚Äôre both right, I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she replied quietly as she smoothed out some wayward strands of wool on Danly‚Äôs head.

She then looked up at me and cleared her throat a little, ‚ÄúI-... I‚Äôm sorry, Elanor,‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok,‚Äù I said quickly, raising my hands with my palms out defensively, ‚Äúreally, I-I understand, you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong I-‚Äù

Tolve gave me a sidelong look and shut my mouth, my face going red with embarrassment, ‚Äúthank you, Helin,‚Äù I said quietly.

*Ok, well, this is progress. Good progress!*

***You‚Äôre so lucky Tolva‚Äôs here.***

*Well yeah, that‚Äôs part of what makes him so wonderful. He‚Äôs a great cultural ambassador.*

From indoor pieces to outdoor designs like your [outdoor side table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/tables/outdoor-side-tables) or [round outdoor coffee table](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/tables/outdoor-coffee-tables), regular maintenance ensures long-lasting beauty and functionality. Here‚Äôs a complete guide to help you maintain your [natural furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) and other home staples effectively.

# 1. Clean Regularly to Avoid Build-Up

Dust, dirt, and spills can dull the appearance of your furniture over time. Regular cleaning prevents build-up and keeps surfaces fresh and polished.

* **For Indoor Furniture:** Dust wooden surfaces weekly with a soft, lint-free cloth. For upholstered pieces, vacuum frequently to remove debris and prevent fabric wear.
* **For Outdoor Furniture:** Wipe down your **outdoor side table** and **round outdoor coffee table** with a damp cloth and mild soap to remove dirt, pollen, and stains.

**Pro Tip:** Avoid using harsh chemicals, especially on **natural furniture**, as they can damage finishes and materials.

# 2. Protect Furniture from Sunlight and Moisture

Both indoor and outdoor furniture can fade or warp when exposed to direct sunlight or excess humidity.

* **For Natural Furniture:** Keep wooden pieces out of prolonged sunlight to preserve their color and texture. Use curtains or blinds to reduce sun exposure indoors.
* **For Outdoor Furniture:** Place your **round outdoor coffee table** and other pieces in shaded areas or use protective covers when not in use. Choose water-resistant coatings or materials to prevent weather damage.

# 3. Use Coasters, Mats, and Tablecloths

Prevent stains and scratches by using protective accessories like coasters, mats, and tablecloths.

* Place coasters under beverages on your **outdoor side table** to avoid water rings.
* Use placemats on dining tables to shield surfaces from heat and spills.
* For **natural furniture**, ensure felt pads or protectors are used under decorative items to prevent scratches.

# 4. Refinish and Repair When Needed

Over time, furniture can show signs of wear, but minor damages are often fixable with refinishing or small repairs.

* **Wood Furniture:** Sand and reapply a protective sealant or varnish to restore shine and durability.
* **Outdoor Furniture:** Replace loose screws or cracked components on your **outdoor side table** or other items to maintain stability.
* **Upholstery:** Spot-clean spills promptly and consider professional cleaning for deep stains or odors.

# 5. Seasonal Maintenance for Outdoor Furniture

Outdoor furniture requires special attention, particularly during changing seasons.

* In winter, store your **round outdoor coffee table** and other pieces indoors or use heavy-duty covers to protect them from the elements.
* Clean cushions and fabrics before storing them to avoid mildew or unpleasant odors.

# 6. Polish and Condition Natural Furniture

Polishing keeps wood looking vibrant and nourished.

* Use a natural furniture polish or oil to maintain the beauty of wooden pieces.
* Test the product on a small, hidden area first to ensure compatibility with your furniture‚Äôs finish.

# 7. Check Joints and Connections

Furniture longevity depends on its structural integrity.

* Regularly check the joints and fasteners of your furniture, including screws, nails, or glue.
* Tighten or repair any loose parts to prevent further damage.

**Why Proper Maintenance Matters**

Whether it‚Äôs a stunning **round outdoor coffee table**, a practical **outdoor side table**, or elegant **natural furniture** indoors, proper care extends the lifespan of your investment and enhances its appearance. By following these tips, you‚Äôll preserve the beauty and functionality of your furniture, keeping your home stylish and comfortable.

They then hung these menus on a wall by sticking pins in the back page (or in this case, the special one page menu).  Many menus have been dated from late 1970's to early 1980's, so 1970's is a rough guess for this menu. This single sided menu has information written on the back in pencil. It has three folds.

I‚Äôm looking for some friendly company to watch the New Year's Eve fireworks in Toronto this year! I'm new to the city and thought it would be great to share the experience with others instead of going solo.

If you're also looking for someone to hang out with or are part of a group that wouldn‚Äôt mind an extra person tagging along, let me know! I'm open to meeting up earlier for coffee or snacks before heading to the fireworks.

Let‚Äôs make the last night of the year a memorable one! üéá

1hq922g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1hq922g/scared_and_confused/,Scared and confused.,"I (34F) have been married to my husband (39M) for a little over 8 years. 
I was his third wife. I guess that should have been the red flag. But he pursued me and we were into some of the same things like stuff about space, science, philosophy and video games. Both his exes left him and I had two serious relationships and both men left me. So he told me he doesn‚Äôt leave. And I loved that. He made it out like he would work through anything with me. He even made a little joke when we first started dating, to train him the way I want him to be.

But anyways. . It was 7 years of absolute hell. I married him and 4 months later he has a manic episode and goes into psychosis. (I had NO IDEA he was mentally ill) I picked up on some weird vibes and moodiness but nothing too out of the ordinary. I‚Äôve never been around anyone bipolar‚Ä¶ like ever! So I had no idea what was going on. So about 4 months after we got married he was at his parents with his two kids (two kids by two different women) it was his weekend to have them and we were living in a 1 bedroom apartment while our house was being renovated so he had more room at his parents. When he became manic it was for like a week‚Ä¶he didn‚Äôt eat or sleep. Constantly staying up at night writing. Well he got his kids for the weekend and when he was there at his parents, he saw something on the news about Russia sending an atom bomb to America and he freaked! He called me screaming saying a bomb is coming! He had his kids in the truck going about 130 on the interstate to try and get to our apartment asap because we have a basement. So as he gets off the interstate his truck just shuts off and they slam into the concrete underpass. So his kids get out and he has them running (barefoot by the way) to get to our apartment. Someone saw the wreck and offered to give my husband a ride. Someone else called the cops because he left the scene of the accident with kids. The cops check his plates and call his dad and is like where is your son and the two kids?! Luckily I talked to his dad and told him he had the kids locked in the basement. 20-30 Cops show up, block every alley way, and draw their guns. A hostage negotiator had to call my husband to let go of the kids. He lets em go and he comes up the basement stairs. He‚Äôs forced to an inpatient behavioral health unit at a hospital for two weeks. So I stuck with him through that. I wouldn‚Äôt want someone to give up on me. I wanted to help him. I loved him and wanted him better. 

He started new drugs that I loved. It made his mood more peaceful, he was easier to get along with, not so irritable and fun to be around. But he didn‚Äôt like the new drug, said it made him feel like a zombie and it gave him ED. Okay whatever. So he tried a new anti psychotic and anti depressant. He likes those. I hate them. His tendency to be cruel and irritability were still there. His moodiness and manic episodes were still there. But whatever‚Ä¶I put up with being physically and mentally abused by him for 7 years. He starts to break me and my mind. I became more and more depressed and isolated. I lived away from family in TN. I stayed too because we had a great life financially. I knew I had become accustomed to that lifestyle but I didn‚Äôt want to let it go. I knew more was coming when his parents passed away. And we had lots of dreams, like building our home and traveling. He didn‚Äôt make me sign a pre nup. Because I did actually love him. I chased him, fought for the relationship, begged for his love and etc. I‚Äôm sure he enjoyed every minute of my suffering. Telling me I‚Äôm worthless all the time, I‚Äôm nothing without his money. Telling me to kill myself constantly. Told me I wasn‚Äôt worth fighting for. Told me I‚Äôm a woman, women don‚Äôt deserve respect. Would demand I wear a dress and quit my job just to service him. I didn‚Äôt have to work but I did to have something to do. I worked from home, so it wasn‚Äôt bad. I didn‚Äôt want him to have complete control of me. I still wanted to have my own job, 401k and insurance. Some independence. He would tell me the government has convinced me to work. 

The physical violence started around the 3rd year of the marriage. I have a bad back and he has a black belt in karate and he would get mad and karate kick my back and knock me to the ground. I can‚Äôt see without glasses or contacts. And at this time I was out of contacts and needed to eventually get more. One day he is screaming in my face and he takes my glasses off and breaks them in half and knocks the lenses out. I can‚Äôt see shit. I can‚Äôt even see to look for the glasses and I‚Äôm begging and crying to him to please help me find them so I can see. But no, he said fuck you and walked out. I had to crawl on the ground for like 30 minutes just to find each peace and try and put them together enough to ride to the eye doctor that day and get some contacts and order more glasses. One time he was mad at me and going off on me and he threw coffee in my face. And said fuck you and left. Like all I ever wanted was his attention and affection and emotional intimacy but he took that as fighting words and he wanted to be as cruel as possible to me. Broke my things, broke my laptop, broke our flat screen tv, turned on the house fire extinguisher, broke his huge computer screen that‚Äôs real wide and goes around the desk.
Would flip furniture and try and pull the fridge out of the spot it‚Äôs in and try and throw it to the ground. Luckily he wasn‚Äôt strong enough. He punched me in the back of my head. Threw things at me. Pushed me into a window and the curtains and blinds all broke and fell down. Knocked me to the ground countless times.
Called me a cunt and bitch all the time. Told me I deserved it. 

But in 2022, that was the last straw and I was done being emotionally attached to this evil person. He broke a wedding gift a good friend of mine made for us. Then went in my wallet and started bending every card. That was it. I was done. I was so so so done. I stop interacting with him and I stopped reacting to him. Stopped going to dinner with him, stop saying even hey we he got home. 

He could tell something was up. I wasn‚Äôt emotionally reacting anymore. I‚Äôd just shrug my shoulders and move on. I started flying back to TN to spend more time with family. I would leave and be gone 3 weeks at a time sometimes. He‚Äôd bitch and moan he doesn‚Äôt have a wife now, I‚Äôm always gone. Bleh. Bleh.

But like I said I had emotionally detached from him. 

I went and saw a lawyer and she told me everything I could get (I was asking for a lot less than I could get) but I wanted to be fair and I didn‚Äôt want to take him to the cleaners. He might fucking kill me. I could have gotten alimony for 7 years and the equity out of the rental investment we had. I got a good amount and he paid it all like he was supposed to from savings and he refinanced the house. But he fought me on all of it. I moved back to TN July 1st and I‚Äôve been here since. He‚Äôs begged for me to come back. But it‚Äôs over. 

What I‚Äôm confused about is I feel like I took every step my lawyer discussed with me. But it feels like when we finally get to that step, she tells me there‚Äôs more?! And I‚Äôm just like am I even going to get divorced at this point?! In Virginia you have to be separated 6 months. I finally filed separation on June 20 and 6 months is December 20. She told me to call before the 20th and pay $750 and she will start the paperwork. So I pay the $750 and I‚Äôm waiting to hear back from them and nothing. I talk to her paralegal and she tells me now, that him and I have to sign an affidavit and have it notarized. Then a divorce decree notarized and send in to the judge. Why was none of this gone over in the initial consult?! Like more and more stuff keeps coming up that I have to do. He‚Äôs in Virginia, I‚Äôm in Tennessee. It‚Äôs kind of hard to do paperwork together. He‚Äôs slow anyways and wouldn‚Äôt know what to do. Plus he‚Äôs off his meds and who knows what mental state he‚Äôs in. 

Well I try to text him, I had not talked to him in about 10 days.  And he did mention to me the last time we talked, he went cold turkey on all his meds. I was like that‚Äôs not a good idea. You are putting yourself and others in danger. He was like fuck you, I don‚Äôt care. So I text him to tell him we have to do TWO more pieces of paper to sign and I said I‚Äôd call later after work. Well with an iPhone, if it doesn‚Äôt say delivered‚Ä¶.either the phone is off or they have blocked you. So of course I knew he blocked me. He did childish shit like that in our marriage ALL THE TIME. Like I just could never have a normal conversation with him. He has no comprehension skills and just gets mad and cruel like a fucking wild animal. So some hours go by and I try to call his mom to get her to ask him to unblock me so we discuss paperwork. She was the best thing about my marriage. I hit the lottery of mother in laws lol. She was a wonderful woman. Well of course, he didn‚Äôt call. I‚Äôm panicking at this point because I‚Äôm thinking to myself the sooner we get the affidavit and divorce decree signed, the sooner things would be over. 

So I decide to call him from a blocked number and he answers. The old raged out man psycho was back. Cussing me out and tell me fuck you and hangs up. So I try again one more time and he answers and just full on rage cussing me out and I‚Äôm just like please listen we have two things to sign and he‚Äôs like fuck off. It‚Äôs silent for a second and his 18 year son (that lives with my soon to be ex husband) picks up the phone and says in a calm tone what do you want? 
I first apologized to him that his father is involving his child in adult situations. Isn‚Äôt it like child abuse to involve your kids? Well whatever, he‚Äôs 18. I explained the two papers that have to be signed, notarized, and the originals given to my lawyer. But he‚Äôs 18 and not an expert of divorce so I don‚Äôt he understand what needed to be done. Then the sons gf pipes in for some reason and is like fuck you bitch, he don‚Äôt want you. Quit fucking calling. Well unfortunately, 8 years of pint up rage came out. I told that girl she‚Äôs white trash and needs to shut the fuck up. I was like your own parents didn‚Äôt even want you. (She was kicked out. Don‚Äôt know too much detail on that) she‚Äôs yelling. Then the step son starts calling me a bitch and I have ugly teeth (my teeth are all straight and white. He has terrible teeth and his mom can‚Äôt afford braces) so I told him he‚Äôs just taking his insecurities and hate he has for himself on me. He cusses me more‚Ä¶calls me a clean freak lmao? Like that‚Äôs a diss. And just kept on and on and I was like ya know what. Let‚Äôs say my step son‚Äôs name is Josh. 


**warning before reading this paragraph**
**trigger warning**

I said ya know what Josh, go fucking kill yourself. He finally shut up and he was taken back a bit and he was like ‚Ä¶ uh what? I said yeah go fucking kill yourself and hung up. I haven‚Äôt heard from him since Dec 18.

I always told my husband when he would tell me to kill myself, he would never say that to his kids. And I say I‚Äôm someone‚Äôs daughter! Do you think my mother and father would appreciate you saying that to me? And he would always tell me I don‚Äôt care. Judge me if you want for saying that. I guess for going low instead of being the better person but at this point he was an adult and if he wants to fuck with me and cuss me out, imma give it right back to em even harder. I apologize if anyone gets upset about this section of the story. 

I spoke to my lawyer about and everything that happened and she said she‚Äôs going to handle it. She said she will email  and mail the affidavit to him and if he doesn‚Äôt answer it two weeks, he will serve him. Then he has 21 days to respond. 
I feel like it‚Äôs just more and more time. I was expecting to be divorce by January maybe February. But he has me blocked and won‚Äôt communicate with me. Also, apart of the settle agreement, we have to do our taxes together for 2024. But how can I do taxes with someone who I can‚Äôt speak with?! How do I know he will even turn the stuff in to the accountant. Just more drama, more stress, more flight or fight and etc.

I want it over. I don‚Äôt want to be connected to him in anyway. I‚Äôm ashamed of myself for staying with him. Making myself believe I deserved the abuse. The money was nice and helped but I was a broken person. He broke me. He mentally tortured me for years. I disassociate constantly. I have horrible short term memory loss issues. 

Then I‚Äôll get he affidavit and decree and their still be some crap to have to deal with. 

Okay sorry I typed so much.

TLDR; husband has turned on me at the last step of the divorce and is refusing to speak with me. He‚Äôs also involving his son in our business. ",1,1735627595.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

Guilt, anxiety and depression","Firstly I suffered from anxiety and depression for the last 20 years. The below has given my massive anxiety and guilt mixed in with grief and a stabbing pain in my stomach. I really don't know what I'm looking for here.

My mother died the day after Christmas 

My mother had lung cancer for 6 years. She lived with my older brother for this time. I live overseas but I came back 6x this year. I took care of her for 5 weeks in September October but also came back for Christmas and rented a place. She had ceased treatment and was given 50/50 to make it to Christmas. She had Christmas with her 2 surviving children and 2 grandchildren. However, it all went bad when my kids left.

I have a bad relationship with my brother. He treated me badly as a child, he also sexually abused me too. I was 5-7, he was 12-14. He also took drugs and caused problems for my parents. Eventually he was jailed but later he turned his life around and became successful. I thought i had forgave him but apparently not. I had my own success but he always wanted to dominate for some reason and he loves to bait me.

So, after my kids left my brother, who turned up late brought a lot of beer. We both drank and he brought up the past and began to minimize it. I asked him to avoid the topic but he did it again and again and I completely lost it calling him every name under the sun while my mother lay in the bedroom. I eventually kicked him out at 7p.m. I fell asleep at 9p.m next to my mum who had been in the room and was very frail and incapable of eating or really doing anything other than lying in bed. I was drunk and don't recall what I said of anything. The fight makes me terribly guilty, what did I say, why did I drink rather than spend every precious moment. I know it was a terrible situation to see her like that but still.

I woke at 8a.m and she had labored breathing and had somehow moved to the sofa because I snore (I think). I said we should go to hospital. She said no. I wasted an hour doing fuck all. Maybe more. Got her a coffee, then went and watched  YouTube ffs. Hoping it would get better but I didn't call an ambulance. She didnt want to move but I moved her to the bed and proped her up. At 1030a.m my brother called. More fucking around. By 11.40a.m things were bad and we took her in his vehicle to hospital. Her body went limp as we lifted her but her eyes were open, lips moving. I held her as she died in the car, maybe in the wheel chair. They attempted cpr but no point of course. 

I know she died on her terms and made Christmas but I feel I was 'negligent'. Why didn't I call an ambulance, did my tirade again my brother push her over the edge, did I say something really hurtful before I fell asleep, why didn't I hold her hand in that last hour or 2 rather than hoping (assuming) or avoiding the problem. It could never have been fixed, she was 84 and on her very last saps of energy but I still feel shockingly guilty nonetheless.

Just wasn't my best self maybe in the last 24/48 hours but I did try. It was inevitable. She hated the idea of dying in hospital. Lucky I was here rathed than her dying when i was away.. Just beating myself up I guess.

People tell me I have nothing to feel guilty about but I just feel this way, it's NYE here and I'm miserable.",1,1735627562.0,depression,1,1.0,False

I have been fat/obese all my life but somehow after corona my weight has been stagnant from 125-127kgs never been more.

Work:
So I am aiding my family in business. It's a small business so I have to put like 10 to 11 hrs daily in it, (Sundays it's like 5-6 hrs but still). It's also a very stressful business.

It's been like more than 2 weeks since I have been following this regime that I feel is best in my knowledge for me.

Exercise:
I exercise at home Itself. It's hard to hit 10k steps in a day as it almost takes 2 hrs so I believe indoor cycling is better, so I cycle 30 mins in the morning, 30 min in the evening before dinner. Plus I do some body exercises like lunges, crunches, squats, sit ups, for 10 min after each cycling session. 
I also try to do some weight training (not daily) with some weights I have, 2 pcs 5kg each and 2 pc 2kg each. I usually do bicep curls, hammer curls, shoulder press and tricep extensions. Nothing fancy. 
All this plus I try my best to include some steps as well but I am not sure how many steps I am taking cause tracking is not possible.

Diet: 
I have a very basic diet. 

Morning: Empty stomach black coffee just before my cycling session.

Breakfast: two fruits 100 gms each( usually pineapple, apple, kiwi, orange, sometimes dragon fruit) with two boiled eggs/ 100 gms paneer(tue and sat)

Lunch: I skip lunch cause my work doesn't require much energy, and I don't feel like eating at my work place.

Pre cycling black coffee

Dinner: From mon to fri, I have a very heavy dinner, that's what I think. Cause sometimes I am full before even finishing it. I have 250 gms of cooked thick dal (masoor, chickpea, rajma) with 200 gms of refrigerated rice and a whole lot of sauteed vegetables (almost 300 gm post cooking) in minimal oil (tomatos, onions, french beans, capsicum, bell peppers, carrots, mushroom) I also add some protein in form of paneer and soya chunks, or have two boiled eggs. I follow this meal with one scoop of protein shake.

On Saturdays i cheat, but it's a clean cheat. I eat two signature wraps from subway(tandoori chicken and b.m.t) with 5 piece chicken meatballs and 2 double dark chocolate cookies. This is like 2000 kcal with almost 100+ gms protein. I exercise for an extra 30 mins on weekends to compensate a bit for this meal. Also I don't eat carbs on Sunday, only protein rich food like paneer, soya chunks, cheese, eggs and whey protein.

Water intake: 
I drink like 4.5-5 litres of water daily.
200 ml in morning with coffee
500 ml after morning workout 
2.5 - 3 litres of water at work
200 ml in evening with coffee
500 ml after evening workout 
250 ml with protein shake.
Rest from food.

It's been like 18 days since I have been following this but haven't felt any changes in weight or inch loss. Am I lacking something. I know my protein intake is less but I don't think I can add more protein without crossing 1500 kcal. Any changes that would help me, cause I am losing all hopes and motivation.",2,1735627516.0,Fitness_India,18,1.0,False

I did a 4 month treatment (this was my second round of accutane - the first one cleared my skin but acne started coming back after a couple of years) and while this second round made my skin better it‚Äôs definitely not the expected result from accutane. The longest I go without breaking out is a week and that‚Äôs only because I also don‚Äôt eat dairy sugar and coffee. When I eat those, I get new pimples almost every day. 

When the 4 months was over I asked my doctor to keep me on for longer but he insisted that my skin is perfectly fine and I don‚Äôt need it and told me I can get a second opinion. Problem is in my country getting a derm referral takes 3 months. So when I saw the second derm he agreed that my round was too short but after 3 months we can no longer just continue the last course I‚Äôd have to start a third round. 

I decided to try spironolactone and see if that works before doing yet another round. I also started using adaplene again to at least maintain the improvements from the accutane, although I seem to be purging so I might stop bc I just can‚Äôt handle any more pimples (also I think it‚Äôs more proof my treatment was incomplete bc I shouldn‚Äôt have anything to purge after finishing accutane so recently). 

Anyways this is mostly a rant but if anyone has any advice please let me know.

1hq8yzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/KidneyStones/comments/1hq8yzp/first_timer/,First timer,"Editing to add demographics. 30F was woken up on 13 December at 0530 in excruciating right flank pain. Paced around for a bit then scrunched up on the couch with a heat pack at my back. Took a two hour nap then woke with with almost no pain. 

Almost exactly a week later on 20 December at 0830 woke up with right flank pain that started at a 4/10 then ramped up over two hours to a 8/10 with such intense nausea I threw up. Drove 15 minutes to my preferred hospital and by the time I parked I was at 2/10 pain with little nausea. Didn't go into the ER because it felt silly to go in with symptoms mostly resolved. I have standing orders for urine sample with cultures if indicated so I peed in a cup and went on with my day. Dip stick found occult blood. Started to have burning with urinating on this day.

Next day went to urgent care, peed in another cup, still showed occult blood. Talked with the ARNP about concerns over a possible UTI and we agreed to send a prescription for antibiotics that I could pick up if I wanted to. I wanted to wait to get antibiotics until after the urine culture came back to see if they were warranted or not.

At 0900 on 22 December had some pain and nausea that quickly went to 9/10 pain with sweats, shakiness, extreme nausea. Went to the ER in tears and quickly went into a room after triage. Found myself pacing and dry heaving until a round of toradol and zofran went in. That curbed the pain for maybe 40 minutes until it climbed to a 7/10. At that point the PA who was overseeing my care came back in and said I have a 5mm occluding stone just above the right ureteral vesicular junction with mild hydroureteronephrosis and multiple calculi in the right kidney qith the largest at 4mm. A dose of dilaudid and acetaminophen with a short nap had me heading home with an urgent referral to urology, several prescriptioton, and a strainer to sift for gold. 

Moving forward, most of my pain is low abdominal with some burning with urination still. Nausea still comes and goes seemingly at random. As of today I am experiencing a return of right flank pain. 

I saw a tiny piece of really dark reddish brown hard material pass in my urine early on the 27th and nothing since. No frank blood this entire time nor changes to urine stream not associated with tamsulosin. 

Here's the odd part: my diet nor exercise habits have changed over the course of this year. I have a coffee in the mornings (cold brew or an espresso drink) and the one to two tea or cola drinks through the week. Daily I drink 2-2.5 liters of straight water with the occasional electrolyte pack added to curb flavor boredom. 

The only large medical change I had this year was an eight week long ESBL e. coli UTI requiring almost five weeks of various antibiotics and a weeklong hospital admission for IV antibiotics. 

Aside from sharing my experience I have a question: aside from upping the amount of water I consume is there any benefit to changing my diet to be low-purine as recommended from my ER visit instructions? Or should I wait until a stone passes and is sent for lab analysis? ",2,1735627252.0,KidneyStones,0,1.0,False
1hq8yh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BesteDekoSchwarz/comments/1hq8yh1/how_does_black_decor_work_in_small_rooms/,How Does Black Decor Work In Small Rooms?,"The Benefits of Using Black Decor in Small Rooms
------------------------------------------------

Using black decor in small rooms can be a powerful design strategy that creates a stylish and inviting atmosphere. Black is often overlooked when it comes to compact spaces, but it can be one of your best tools for transforming a small area into a chic retreat. Here‚Äôs how black decor can work wonders in your limited spaces.

### Creates a Sense of Depth

One of the main benefits of using black in a small room is its ability to create a sense of depth. Dark colors tend to recede, giving the illusion of more space. If you paint one wall black or incorporate black furniture, you may find that the room feels larger and more expansive than it actually is. Consider adding a black accent wall or a few well-placed black shelves to make your room appear more dimensional.

### Enhances Contrast and Focus

Black decor can provide stunning contrast, especially against lighter shades. This contrast draws the eye, allowing you to highlight specific elements in the room. For example, if your walls are light-colored, introducing a black coffee table or a black lamp can direct attention to those pieces, making them focal points. You can also use black frames for artwork, which can enhance visuals without overwhelming the space.

### Offers Timeless Elegance

Black decor not only looks modern and stylish, but it also exudes a timeless elegance. When you incorporate black into your small room, you can achieve a sophisticated look that never goes out of style. This can be especially beneficial for creating a classic vibe in your space. Whether you add black curtains, furniture, or decorative objects, you are creating a cohesive look that can last for years to come.

### Improves Lighting Dynamics

In small rooms, lighting plays a crucial role in how the space feels. Black decor can work with light to create various effects. For instance:

Check the Details Here -&gt; ;) https://amzn.to/3Bwu5mR  
  
- Using black furniture can absorb light during the day while creating a cozy atmosphere at night.
- Black wall art can add complexity to your room, depending on the lighting.
- Illuminate dark corners with lamps that have black shades, allowing the light to reflect in a unique way.

### Brings in Texture

Texture is essential for adding depth to a small room. Black d√©cor can come in various materials‚Äîthink velvet, leather, or matte finishes. Each of these options adds richness and interest to your space. You can mix textures effectively; for instance, pairing a shiny black coffee table with matte black wall decor can create a dynamic look. This variation can make a small room feel more layered and inviting.

### Acts as a Neutral Base

Black is a neutral color, which means it can effortlessly blend with other colors in your decor scheme. This versatility allows you to change your design easily without needing to replace your dark pieces. For instance, if you want to introduce a splash of color, light-colored or bright furniture can complement black decor beautifully. The beauty of black is its ability to adapt; you can switch up your accent colors seasonally without a complete overhaul of the room.

### Facilitates Personalization

Using black decor gives you a canvas to express your style. You can add vibrant throw pillows, colorful artwork, or quirky accessories to customize your space. Each of these elements will stand out against the black backdrop, providing personalized touches that reflect who you are. Don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment with patterns and colors; black creates a solid base for diverse decor styles.


In a world where lighter colors often dominate interior design, don‚Äôt underestimate the power of black decor in small rooms. It can create depth, enhance contrast, and bring elegance to your space without feeling claustrophobic. By thoughtfully incorporating black, you can make any small room feel stylish, spacious, and distinctly yours.

Tips for Balancing Light and Dark Tones in Compact Spaces

### Understanding the Impact of Light and Dark Tones

Light and dark colors have different effects on how we perceive space. Light tones tend to make a room feel airy and open, while dark tones can add depth and coziness. Understanding how these tones work together will help you achieve a harmonious look.

### Choose a Color Palette

Start by selecting a cohesive color palette. Ideally, this should include various shades of both light and dark tones. Here‚Äôs how to create a balanced palette:

- **Select a Dominant Color:** Choose a light color as the base for your room. This could be a soft beige, pale gray, or off-white.
- **Incorporate Dark Accents:** Choose a few dark colors for accents. Deep navy, charcoal gray, or black can work well to create contrast.
- **Add Neutrals:** Incorporate neutral shades, like taupe or cream, to soften transitions between light and dark tones.

### Balance with Accessories

Accessories are a great way to introduce dark tones without overwhelming the space. Consider strategically placing darker items like cushions, rugs, or artwork. Here are some tips:

- **Cushions and Throws:** Use dark cushions on light furniture to pop color while maintaining balance.
- **Artwork:** Consider dark-framed pictures against light-colored walls to draw attention.
- **Rugs:** A dark rug can ground a space and provide a stunning contrast to lighter flooring.

### Utilize Natural Light

Maximizing natural light can help balance darker tones in your compact space. To enhance brightness, consider these techniques:

- **Window Treatments:** Opt for sheer curtains that allow light to filter in while providing privacy.
- **Mirrors:** Hang mirrors opposite windows to reflect light and make the room feel larger.
- **Keep Windows Unobstructed:** Avoid heavy furniture near windows to let in as much daylight as possible.

### Layer Your Lighting

Good lighting is essential for balancing light and dark tones. Use a mix of ambient, task, and accent lighting to create a warm glow. Consider the following:

- **Ambient Lighting:** Use ceiling fixtures or wall sconces to provide general illumination.
- **Task Lighting:** Include table lamps and reading lights for specific areas, focusing on darker accents.
- **Accent Lighting:** Highlight artwork or architectural features with spotlights or LED strips.

### Incorporate Textures

Textures can break up the visual monotony of light and dark tones, adding depth to your space. Consider using a mix of materials such as:

- **Soft Fabrics:** Choose plush cushions or curtains in light tones to soften the room.
- **Wood Elements:** Dark wooden furniture can create a cozy atmosphere against lighter walls.
- **Metallic Finishes:** Use gold or silver accents for a touch of elegance and shine that complements both tones.

### Experiment with Furniture Placement

How you arrange your furniture can greatly affect the balance between light and dark tones. Try these layout tips:

- **Group Lighter Pieces Together:** Place light-colored furniture in one area to create a focal point.
- **Contrast with Darker Items:** Balance darker furniture pieces with lighter decor surrounding them.
- **Open Layouts:** Avoid overcrowding and create open pathways to maintain a spacious feel.

By following these tips, you can create an inviting and balanced atmosphere in your small space that harmonizes light and dark tones. The key is to embrace the interplay of colors and textures, allowing each element to complement the other. With thoughtful choices and strategic arrangements, your compact room can be both stylish and functional.

### Conclusion

Embracing black decor in small rooms can transform your space into a chic and sophisticated haven. By understanding the unique benefits this bold color offers, such as creating a sense of depth and drama, you can enhance the aliveness of your compact area. Black not only adds elegance, but it also helps to define spaces, making them feel more intentional and curated.

Balancing light and dark tones is essential in achieving a harmonious look. Light accents, such as white furniture or bright wall art, can soften the intensity of black decor while preventing the room from feeling closed in. reflective surfaces, like mirrors and glass, can amplify natural light and give your room an airy feel, counteracting any heaviness that black may bring.

Ultimately, the key to successfully using black decor in small rooms lies in your choices. By using strategic elements‚Äîlike contrasting textures and varied materials‚Äîyou can maintain a visually appealing space that feels larger than it is. Whether it‚Äôs through playful accessories, wall art, or statement furniture pieces, a well-executed black decor scheme can lead to remarkable results.

Embrace the boldness of black, and you'll find that it not only enhances your room's character but also allows your personal style to shine through. With thoughtful planning and a few creative strategies, your small space can become a striking statement of design that inspires and delights.",1,1735627190.0,BesteDekoSchwarz,0,1.0,False

1hq8u1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hq8u1d/aitah_for_being_skinnier_than_my_twin_sister/,AITAH for being skinnier than my twin sister?,"So, I (22 F) have a twin sister (22 F). We are fraternal twins. We were born premature and were also allergic to most types of milks. Thus, we struggled a bit to eat and gain weight. When we were toddlers I was a very picky eater but my sister was not. I don't know why but I just would not want to eat something that looked too weird or had a gross colour or texture to it and so I was always extremely skinny. My sister was not a picky eater and would always finish her whole plate of food and then proudly go around the house showing everyone that she had ate all her food like a good girl. My sister and I always fought with each other and basically hated each other. My mother used to threaten us that she was gonna place us into different schools if we can't stop fighting with each other. So, as every immature child does, we would argue with each other and used to insult each other to make the other angry. I would tell my sister that she was fat and was a nerd for wearing glasses and having braces and she used to tell me that i was dumb for not being able to understand math and that I was anorexic. So, anyway fastforward to the now. We atleast don't hate each other anymore and we fight less because we each have our own bedrooms now. I am still a picky eater but not as bad as I was when I was a child. My sister is still bigger than me and is a foodie. I am 5ft tall and weigh 48kg while my sister is 5ft 2 inches and weighs 78kg. I don't mean to expose my sister's weight, I just want to show the difference between our heights and weights so you can get an idea of what I am talking about. So, anyway I think my sister is starting to hate me because I am skinnier than her. Every time that guests come over to our house my parents introduce us as ""The Twins"". The problem is that when guests ask how to tell the difference between us my grandmother would say ""oh, (name) is the small one and (name) is the big one."" This would understandably upset my sister every time. I think what my grandmother means by ""small and big"" is that I am the short one and my sister is taller than me. But, I really feel like my gran has to find better words to explain that then. But, anyway now that we are older and now woman instead of girls, we usually spark up conversations with our friends about how we want to start exercising and eating healthier so we can look good when we meet our future husbands one day. Well, each time this conversation pops up my sister throws subtle comments into the conversation to make it clear to me that she does not like the way I look and would not want to be my weight. She would always look at me and say ""no offense, I want to lose weight but I definitely do not want to look like you at all. You are just too skinny"". I usually just laugh akwardly as I do not know how to respond but secretly it does hurt a little when she says that. I am also self-conscious about how skinny I am because I have really small breasts and they make me feel insecure. Also, when we meet new people my sister jumps at the opportunity to tell them her sob story about how I was always skinnier and prettier than her and that the boys in school always looked at me instead of her and so on. She then tells them how she is happy with the way that she looks and that she does not want to lose weight(which is not true cause she does want to lose weight). The guests then always try and comfort her and tell her that she shouldn't think that way and that is is not fat. I think that she secretly WANTS to hear them tell her that she is not fat and she shouldn't do anything to try and better herself so she has a reason to get out of excerising and trying to lose weight. The thing that annoys me the most about her is when she sees me eating a slice of cake or anything unhealthy, she would glare at me and say ""How do you eat sooo much but don't gain any weight!? It's so unfair!?  The thing is I do not eat much at all even if it is unhealthy foods. I just don't really have a big appetite and I am addicted to coffee so I think the coffee also makes me full and so I will eat less. I also eat whatever whenever. I am not the eat 3 meals a day type of person. When I wake up I will have a cup of coffee. I do not eat breakfast as I get nauseous when I eat too early in the morning. I then usually eat whatever I am in the mood for at lunch time such as a slice of cake, toast and egg, instant noodles or whatever. I then usually snack a lot during the day. I will snack on things like blueberries, yogurt, chocolate, chips, or cookies. I will then eat whatever my grandmother makes for dinner but I usually don't finish my dinner as I become full from snacking too much and drinking too much coffee. What really irks me is that my sister tells all of our friends (we have the same friends #twinstuff) that she loves the way she looks and does not want to lose weight, but in reality she does not like how she looks and does want to lose weight. I also hate when she fishes for compliments from others such as when she cries to guests about how fat and ugly she is and they have to comfort her and tell her that there is nothing wrong with the way that she looks. She would also complain every day about how fat she is and how she wants to lose weight but she doesn't do anything to fix that. She will constantly order take outs at work and buy junk food and candy when we go shopping. Now, there is nothing wrong with that but the thing is you need to pace yourself. My sister would buy a massive slab of chocolate or a pack of candies and then eat the whole chocolate slab in one sitting. The same thing with the pack of candies. I usually eat only a few blocks of a slab chocolate. I did eat the whole thing in one sitting once as well but got extremely sick after so I decided I would never do that again. I also am not a big fan of sweets which is maybe why I also don't gain as much weight as my sister. My sister has a sweet tooth. If you were to ask us to pick between sweet vs salt, I will pick salt and she would pick sweet. The only sweet thing that I really love is icecream. But it has to be the frozen yogurt/sorbet type and it must have chocolate pieces in it as well. My sister also always gets angry every time someone tries to motivate her to start exercising. My parents would go for a walk and would ask my sister if she wants to join them. She would then ask if I was gonna walk too, they would reply with no. She would then get angry and ask them why they only asked her if she wanted to join them and not me. She would say ""Are you trying to tell me that I am fat?"" My parents will then try to explain to her how they are just trying to help her to become more healthy. But she will always try and make them feel bad for trying to help out. Well, my sister and I are going to get a gym membership in 2025 and start exercising everyday. I really hope this helps my sister to lose weight, become healthy, gain confidence, and stop hating me.

But I (27f) have had 4 UTI‚Äôs this year after a long period without sex. I had dryness and tearing with my ex seemingly after going back on the pill. But almost no UTI‚Äôs‚Äì maybe 1 or 2 in 10 years. I‚Äôve had UTI‚Äôs before but never to this degree. Just random, treatable ones with years in between. I began hooking up with someone, who is now my partner and it‚Äôs been UTI central. For starters, he is very clean hygiene wise. We both are. STI‚Äôs have been ruled out. Currently seeing a urologist who has me on 3 months of low dose antibiotics to give my bladder some time to heal. Also awaiting Ureaplasma/Mycoplasma results. 

I have ceased birth control to see if dryness was a factor and to reduce my susceptibly to yeast while on a slew of antibiotics. I weaned off of lexapro. It was causing me to bruise like a melon and I found that even minor cuts would not heal while taking it. I quit nicotine in all forms, particularly vaping. I was already kind of off coffee, but cut it out completely along with soda and citrus. I am careful about spicy and acidic food (boo). I changed condoms after finding out that SKYN was adding fragrance to their line. I now use Jems. No more water based lube with glycerine. Uberlube is the most comfortable. Tossed all my old thongs and switched to cotton granny panties. Nothing scented, ever. The list goes on. I always shower after sex now, which admittedly I wasn‚Äôt doing before. Plus I make sure to hydrate immediately and have a good pee within the hour. Forcing a pee immediately causes me pain. 

I have tried all kinds of supplements. I currently prioritize my multivitamins, cranberry PAC‚Äôs, D-mannose and women‚Äôs probiotics. I have experimented with zinc, turkey tail mushroom and turmeric to keep my immune system up especially during the winter. Lot‚Äôs of yogurt, fibre and whole grains to keep my gut moving. Herbal tea‚Äôs out the ass because I can‚Äôt have anything else and they make me feel better. I keep fluconazole on hand too for when the antibiotics cause things to get yeasty. 

Only one of my four infections was cultured and it came back as Ecoli ESBL. Fucking wonderful right? Since then I haven‚Äôt been the same. I‚Äôve taken nitro, cipro, septra and cipro again for a longer period when I received that result. My long term antibiotics are septra. But I keep having pain and not infection pain. It‚Äôs different. My bladder just hurts sometimes. I have spasms and the urge to go when my bladder isn‚Äôt quite full yet. My pelvic floor feels exhausted and sore the same way my thighs do after leg day. I do have a couple days of the week where I‚Äôm mostly okay but god damn. Pelvic floor therapy is wildly expensive too. It only ever burns to pee if I force a pee and it‚Äôs concentrated. Most of this pain is resolved with tylenol/advil, some edibles, my heating pad and a good nights sleep. 

I realize I need to reach out to my urologist again. He is fantastic. I‚Äôm just trying to give it time. I‚Äôve only been on long term antibiotics for a month and a half. Shit needs to heal. But my god WHY. I‚Äôm considering jumping right to post intercourse antibiotics immediately after this. I cannot mentally, physically or financially handle another infection. Also please don‚Äôt come at me about embedded infections. I understand they are potentially a reality for some people. But it‚Äôs to the point where people have pushed their diagnosis on me in other communities. Which has taken a massive toll on my wellbeing. I am not going to chase an infection and will consider more sensitive testing in the future. I am being cultured monthly as well to rule out further resistance. If you made it this far thank you. I‚Äôm sure there are details I‚Äôve missed but all I can say is what the fuck. 

Edit: Missed the part where I mention how much anxiety this has caused me. My life revolves around popping pills, water intake, bathroom breaks and being so insanely careful about sex. Which has brought my partner and I closer but it has caused me to feel broken. I miss carefree sex. I miss going a day without thinking about this. I miss not being uncomfortable or worried.

1hq8rfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1hq8rfq/an_american_familys_10_wonderful_days_in_vietnam/,"An American family's 10 wonderful days in Vietnam (HCMC, Ninh Binh, Hanoi)","We just returned from a Vietnam vacation. I'm sharing my family's experience as guidance to other Westerners considering travel there -- and as a thank you to the wonderful people who made our trip so special.


For context, we are two parents and two college/university children who live in a big US city. We have taken several overseas vacations, but never as far as East Asia. 

We spent 4 nights in Ho Chi Minh City, 3 nights in Ninh Binh (Tam Coc), and 2 nights in Hanoi. We avoided Danang and the surrounding area because it is the rainy season there (we'll get there next time!). 


General thoughts: 
* Vietnam is ridiculously inexpensive. Luxury hotels for $50 a night with gorgeous buffet breakfasts included, amazing meals for $4, 15-minute rideshares for $2, etc. It is literally cheaper to vacation for 10 days in Vietnam INCLUDING AIRFARE than it is to vacation in most big American cities -- no exaggeration.
* The people are awesome. Wandering through neighborhoods or chilling in cafes, we found locals and tourists alike to be friendly. 
* The air quality was shockingly bad. There's a thick haze everywhere. I was breathing extra heavily when exercising. I thought it would be better in Tam Coc outside the major metropolitan areas, but nope -- still bad.
* The food was unfreakingbelieveable. We're relatively adventurous eaters, and we were blown away by the incredible flavors.
* Vietnamese coffee is amazing, but y'all need to step up your craft beer game (sorry).
* HCMC and Hanoi are intense! The traffic, the constant pedestrian traffic, the lack of sidewalk space -- it's all exhilarating and exhausting, even for people from a big American city. Fortunately, y'all have great parks for decompressing from the bustle. 
* People, especially seniors, are in amazing shape -- at least compared to Westerners.
* The War Remnants Museum is a gut-punch but filled with important, well-organized, and tactfully presented content. It's a must-see, especially for Americans.
* The Independence Palace, on the other hand, was kinda boring.
* Ninh Binh/Tam Coc was breathtaking. The Mua Cave hike, the Trang An paddle boat ride, the pagodas --  so special.
* By happenstance, we were at Hoan Kiem Lake in Hanoi during the National Defense Day celebration. Very cool to witness, especially after visiting the War Remnants Museum a few days earlier.


Tips for Westerners planning a Vietnam vacation:
* Download the Grab app. It's awesome and easy, and we avoided scammy taxi drivers.
* Eat where the locals eat. We found great spots simply by politely asking hotel staff, ""Where do YOU eat?"" 
* Find hotels outside the most touristy areas (we stayed in the Phu Nhuan district in HCMC). This is good advice for any vacation destination -- if you stay where the tourists stay, you'll get a tourist experience, complete with overpriced tourist-focused food, souvenir shops, etc. Instead, stay off the beaten path and take a $2-$3 Grab ride to the main attractions when you want to see them.


TL;DR: Amazing, intense experience wonderful people, culture, and food. We loved visiting your country and look forward to exploring more of it another time.

1hq8o06,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintMeghanMarkle/comments/1hq8o06/pitfalls_of_excessive_ego_the_harkles/,Pitfalls of Excessive Ego - The Harkles,"Beebs‚Äô latest video explains why the Harkles are incompetent. Full transparency. The following is from the YouTube transcript; I only formatted it for ease of reading. If anything seems unclear or confusing, I suggest viewing the actual video.

Hi everybody, I'm Beebs Kelley. Welcome back to another video.

A while back, Harry participated in this panel discussion at what I think was called the Deal Book Summit. And this was a selection of interviews and sort of panel discussions that were with very high-powered people.

And Harry, who had no business being there because he is not a businessman at all in any way, shape, or form, looked mad the entire time he participated, and I believe the root of that was insecurity. Let me explain why. He clearly knows that he is not on the same level as these other esteemed guests who were being interviewed, like Jeff Bezos, the CEO of \[sic\]Google. And then we have Harold. Really. He's literally only famous because of who his family is.

He's never built anything. He didn't start anything. He hasn't done any business dealings that have been impressive. He doesn't even have an impressive investment portfolio. If he did, I guarantee we'd be hearing about it. He's not an impressive scholar. He's not particularly accomplished in any way, shape, or form. Accomplished at complaining, maybe.¬†

When you're inserting yourself or allowing yourself to enter a space by accepting an invitation where you do not belong, you are putting yourself on edge and making yourself feel very defensive. Because you are insecure in those situations because you know better. You know that you don't have the business acumen or the track record to be able to be amongst these other people who are very smart and business-minded and have built impressive things themselves and who are able to manage really big, impressive companies on their own. You don't belong there, Harold. Anytime you're in over your head, it's stressful.¬†And a lot of times, we‚Äôre put in situations where we‚Äôre in over our head, not by our own choice. It just happens to us, and we must figure it out along the way. But Harry literally put himself in this position because he either reached out, or his team reached out and asked to be included in this, or they reached out to him and invited him, at which point he could have said, ‚ÄúNo thanks, not sure I'd deliver much value to this crowd.‚Äù But in Harry's case, he either didn't care or wasn't aware that just how out of his league he was at that moment.¬†

And so it's that imposter syndrome, whether you're aware of it or not, or these feelings of inadequacy that were clearly bubbling up in Harry during this panel. And they're in direct conflict with his ginormous ego. And so he feels both entitled to be there and anxious about being there at the same time. So, no wonder he looks so cranky. And during the interview, this was further evidenced that he was very clearly out of his depth, because he ended up making himself look foolish and revealing his hypocrisy. He whined that the palace had a working relationship with the press, which we've been over, is a completely normal and professional, mostly cordial relationship, a dynamic that is closely monitored and relatively controlled, that affords the monarchy exposure, which is important and essential while expanding privacy for the children and the members of the family when they're not on official duties or at events.¬†

But he has whined about that as if it's wrong. But then here he's essentially trying to imply that he'll talk to any news organizations that will offer him and the Meg exclusively positive press. But each time he was challenged about this or asked, ‚ÄúWell, how do you decide what is good or reliable sources or not?‚Äù Harry really was not prepared for this. At another point in the interview where he claims not to read anything, which I think most people don't believe. If you're in the public eye, you're certainly reading at least some things, and if you read any news at all, you'll occasionally see news about yourself.¬†¬†

But when the interviewer expanded upon that, in a way that I don't think Harry has previously experienced very often, he said that he reads press coverage only when necessary, and he only knows it's necessary when his team tells him so. Still, a hole in his story arises. Who determines what is worth laying before Harry? Who is the person controlling his stream of press coverage? It just makes no sense. Either he's a man baby who can't handle reading press, or he's completely unaware of how good or bad the press is and has someone else filtering it based on their own opinions. None of it makes sense, and neither sound like a very good way to go about things.

Additionally, he said that he would continue his court cases because he wants accountability, when, as many other commenters have said, is incredibly hypocritical coming from someone who takes no accountability himself. Over the years, we've never heard Harry and Megan say they've made a mistake, not even once. It's ridiculous. Another point that came up for both Harry and Megan really, as many of you also noted, was the security for the Sussexes being incredibly excessive, much like they're concerned about the media being incredibly excessive. Harry and Megan are overly concerned with press, media, staff, all of it. And this made a lot of people start to think about just how over the top Harry is about all of this.¬†

He's over the top about the press, which was the main subject of conversation with this panel discussion or interview, whatever you want to call it. It was completely boring and unnecessary in so many ways. But they're also super excessive about the security stuff, which his court cases have been back in the news lately because, of course, he's been accused of destroying evidence and wasting the court's time, and he's just so hell-bent on continuing this security thing, which makes the public then have a conversation about what is it that he's so concerned about? Is this security stuff really necessary for Harry? One of the pitfalls of this court case is just how long it's been drawn out, giving the public so much more opportunity, as well as the people involved in the case, so much more opportunity to come to the conclusion that his requests for security are so excessive.¬†

And nothing highlights it better than when you compare it to the actual real Royals. The public has begun to see exactly what the big difference is. There's security to keep crowds in control who are there to see you because they're excited, like we see with King Charles and the Prince of Princess of Wales and Queen Camilla and all the Royals, Princess Anne, Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. When they're out on official duties, people come to see them and they're excited and there needs to be enough security there to make sure all of those people still stay safe and don't, you know, squish each other and things like that. But also to keep the Royals safe, of course, and to keep the entire area safe and clear and traffic safe, all of those things.¬†

But what Harry and Meghan are dealing with is a completely different beast. They need security to keep away people who will boo you and people who dislike you. Harry and Meghan know that they have made a lot of people mad, and now they're worried. They don't want to be heckled. They don't want reporters asking awkward questions the way tabloids do. For example, TMZ or other independent reporters, they'll just throw out the most juicy of questions while filming you while you're just going about your day. You're getting your coffee, celebrities have crazy questions flung at them as they're walking to their car with their Starbucks. And all the while, TMZ or other tabloids or journalists have the camera in their face so they can't react. They have to keep their cool and just put up with the sometimes ridiculous questions, sometimes valid questions.¬†

¬†For Harry and Meghan, that would look like people asking them: ‚ÄúWhy did you accuse the royal family of racism and then take it back?‚Äù ‚ÄúHave you apologized to your family? Are you going to apologize to your family?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy did you lie about this, that, and the other thing?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat's up with how you're walking in those high heels?‚Äù

You know, those are the types of questions Harry and Meghan would be getting thrown at them if it weren't for that excessive amount of security, forbidding those tabloid reporters and TMZ and those types of people from getting close, as well as all the boos. They can't have the boos. Like they did at the Platinum Jubilee, it was clear just how much that upset them. And ever since, the Meg won't step out of the airport in the UK or won't come to the UK at all. There's this huge difference between those two things: security to keep those types of things away and those negative experiences away, or security to just keep things calm, orderly, and safe when there's hundreds of admirers lined up to see you.

Royals who are really well-liked, especially somebody like Princess Catherine, or as we saw with Diana, there's so many people who come to just see them, shake their hand. But it's coming from a very positive place. It's coming from love and admiration. It's coming from respect, from just wanting to see that person because they inspire you. For the Sussexes, it's the complete opposite. Only questions reporters want to ask them is about the drama that they've created around themselves or about negative things.¬†

For the Sussexes, it's very, very different. There isn't a bunch of admirers and people who want to see them, meet them, shake their hands, get a picture with them, or just lay eyes on them in real life. That's not a thing for the Sussexes, but it very much is for the Royals. For the Sussexes, the only people who want to try to show up to wherever they're going to be are reporters who want to ask them those juicy questions and get those more embarrassing pictures or those more embarrassing video clips or just unfortunate, I guess you could say, video clips of asking them those sorts of awkward questions about all the drama that they've created around themselves.

There's no positive vibes. There's no groups of people who cared to show up just to see the Sussexes going about their business. It's just not a thing. And that's a big part of why it looks so strange to have that many security guards and that much staff, because there's no members of the public or floods of paparazzi for the security to worry about and keep away from the Sussexes. They're just not there. There's just Backgrid, who the Meg tips off, and they don't ask questions. That's it. They're just standing there. And so the excessive numbers of security stands out all the more with the Sussexes. If they were popular, if Harry and Meghan were nice people who people were excited to see, and there were a lot of people coming and showing up to see them and being near where they're going to be following them around if there were multiple paparazzi or they weren't so afraid of those types of questions. Then maybe that amount of security would make sense. There's not. So it just looks strange and ridiculous.¬†

And I think that's another thing that I think contributed greatly to the Meg's negative feelings towards the press and her experience in general as a working royal. Media coverage, she came from TV business. Not exactly the same as Hollywood. Hollywood show business is like the top of the tier. The TV show business is a form of show business. It's a little bit different, just like Broadway is a little bit different.¬†But the media she experienced in her little bubble of cable TV show business was very different. Her publicity and her experience with the media through that realm of that show business was very different. to the press coverage and the media relations of the Royals. Very different things, very different groups of people and very different types of journalists.¬†

The interviews, events that she attended, even red carpets that she attended were all designed to promote the show ‚ÄúSuits.‚Äù So the hired photographers, the interviewers, all of the people around those events that she engaged with were hired specifically to help promote the show and therefore showcase the actors in a positive light, including the Meg. And that's very, very different from journalists and general news press for public interest stories about public figures, for example, Royals, politicians, other people who are just big in the public eye who are there to report the facts and get information that's real and tangible.¬†

She was used to that sort of filtered, we're here to make you look good type of press that's not actually press but rather promotion that's very very common in show business. So she was not prepared for real press, how real press was. In her ‚ÄúSuits‚Äù days, only the superest of super fans were that interested in Megan as a person, like her personal life. Her as a human. There wasn't a whole lot of interest in that, not enough for real journalists or paparazzi to follow her around, but with the Royals, very different story.¬†

And so I think this shift in dynamic was something that she still doesn't fully grasp, that reporters and tabloids and press in general isn't just there to report on what you want them to or what you decide to make you look good. It's there to report on the actual stuff happening, and whether you look good or not depends on your behavior. Whether you come across good or not depends on your behavior. Totally different animal and one that I think was a big point of struggle for Meghan Markle. But what do you think?

(I apologize in advance for this being long/lack of formatting, I am on mobile) Backstory: I (36F) have been with my bf (28M) for 3 years, we are currently long distance and have been long distance for almost 2 yrs. I fly to him like once every 6-8 weeks to see him for about a week at a time. 2 weeks ago I was visiting for a few days, and he had his company holiday party to attend, which was about 40 of his coworkers and their partners at a brewery, which started at 3pm. After the brewery part we bar hopped as a smaller group of about 10 people. But 8pm it was just me, my bf, and one of his coworkers, who is one of his close friends - they see each other daily, they coach baseball together as well, they see each other constantly. I don‚Äôt drink much so was pretty buzzed by 8pm and he only had 2 beers throughout the night. I had an early morning flight to catch home, and this was our last night together. And since everyone else had long since gone home and his friend had mentioned several times he needed to get going soon, I asked if we could leave. He kept telling me he wasn‚Äôt ready. I was somewhat already a little irritated because he pretty much left me to fend for myself the whole night, my first time meeting 98% of his coworkers, but I made due and made some friends. I waited another hour, so we‚Äôd been on 6 or so hours, his friend had again mentioned a few times he needed to get going bc his wife would be pissed he was out late. I asked again if we could leave, he still said no, so I said I would get an Uber by myself then. Which to my surprise, he sat and watched me do. It was clear I was irritated. I ubered home to his house by myself, ordered some food, packed, and was going to bed when he got home about an hour later. He comes into the bedroom and turns the lights on, and proceeds to watch YouTube. I turn the lights off and tell him I have to get up early for my flight, and he knows I can‚Äôt sleep with the lights on. He just turns the lights back on and doesn‚Äôt say anything. I turned them back off, he turns them back on. With tears running down my face, I literally beg him to please turn the lights off, and that if he really needs the lights on the watch YouTube, to please go out in the living room. He tells me, ‚Äúno, I need the lights on‚Äù. I get so pissed that I tell him he‚Äôs being really selfish, and I go sleep on the couch, for the first time ever in our relationship. He rarely ever brings me to the airport when I have to go back home, so the next morning I Ubered to the airport and went home (we live 2,000 miles away from one another).  


He doesn‚Äôt say anything to me for about a day, and then finally texts me like 24 hours after I get home, asking, ‚ÄúI have a question.. does your conscience feel like you have anything to apologize for?‚Äù I am seething that he even asks this. Then I have our subsequent conversation screenshot above.   


I went home a few days before his birthday (which is on Christmas Eve) and he knows I couldn‚Äôt be with him on Christmas Eve because I have kids, and in order to be with him on his birthday, I‚Äôd have to miss Christmas Eve and Christmas Day with my kids, which I‚Äôm obviously not willing to do. We weren‚Äôt speaking, but I did tell him Happy Birthday on his birthday. Obviously I didn‚Äôt send him some heartfelt message, because we weren‚Äôt speaking, and I was beyond irate. As you can see from the screenshots above, the main issue I have in our relationship is that I am incredibly selfless when it comes to him, I bend over backwards to do quite literally everything for him. And I get about 2% of that in return.  



I‚Äôm so torn because I was planning to spend the rest of my life with this man, we have so much in common and are so happy most of the time. But I‚Äôm really having trouble dealing with the lack of effort and the constant selfishness. How do I get through to him that this isn‚Äôt just about him not wanting to leave his stupid work party, that it‚Äôs so, so much bigger than that, and that it‚Äôs really important to me that he recognize and work on his self-centeredness and perceived lack of effort? 


He‚Äôs upset with ME because I wanted to go home ‚Äúso early‚Äù, and because when the Uber was picking me up from the bar to take me home alone, his friend/co-worker said something like, ‚Äúoh man, sending her home alone.. you‚Äôre definitely not getting any tonight‚Äù, and I said something like, ‚Äúoh yeah you‚Äôre absolutely correct, he will not be getting laid tonight‚Äù, and he‚Äôs upset because he said I ‚Äúweaponized sex because he wouldn‚Äôt appease me by going home so early‚Äù. This is the reason he won‚Äôt speak to me or even acknowledge all of the things I said in that long ass, pathetic message.

ETA- After the long ass messages I sent which are shown in the screenshots, his reasons was basically that he was mad at ME and that I ‚Äúfeel I‚Äôm the only one that needs to be heard and not him‚Äù. I sent another long message asking if he even bothered to read everything I said, because clearly the issue isn‚Äôt just the holiday party, it‚Äôs everything else. He said he ‚Äúis too tired and is checked out of the conversation‚Äù. We proceed not to talk for a few more days. I then text him last night saying, ‚ÄúI love you and I hope we‚Äôre done with this soon‚Äù. His response was, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the one who didn‚Äôt want to talk‚Äù. I say, ‚ÄúI mean that‚Äôs not true at all. I even said I didn‚Äôt want to sit and ignore each other and not communicate. But you wouldn‚Äôt even take the time to read what I said or even try to understand what I was saying before completely missing the point and refusing to even try to understand what I was saying. So yeah if thats the case then there‚Äôs nothing further to say. Figured if you had a few days to actually take the time to read what I said maybe you‚Äôd get it and be ready to have a conversation. Sounds like that‚Äôs not the case.‚Äù And he proceeds to say:  

‚ÄúI'm telling you now that I really have nothing further to contribute to the conversation‚Äù

I say, ‚ÄúThen why are we even bothering to continue this relationship? If you can‚Äôt even be bothered to listen to me when I feel disregarded, unheard, little effort, you clearly could not possibly care less, why bother continuing if you don‚Äôt give a fuck?‚Äù

He says, ‚ÄúAlright I guess I don‚Äôt care about the conversation then. I am checked out of it.‚Äù I say, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs abundantly clear you‚Äôre checked out of far more than just the conversation. As I‚Äôve stated several times now, the conversation isn‚Äôt even remotely just about whatever happened at your work Christmas party. It‚Äôs so, so much bigger than that. I really don‚Äôt know how much clearer I could possibly be. I am telling you repeatedly that it‚Äôs about your overall unwillingness to *ever* put me before yourself, your inability to put forth even a fraction of the effort you expect of me on a daily basis. I can‚Äôt even expect you to *care* when I‚Äôm feeling disregarded and unheard and not cared about, simply because you can‚Äôt bother to‚Ä¶ care about me? Do you *really* not expect me to just eventually get the picture that you don‚Äôt care *period* and just continue breaking my back daily to try to ensure you‚Äôre happy when you flat out tell me you couldn‚Äôt care less when I‚Äôm unhappy? If you simply don‚Äôt care, why should I? If you can‚Äôt bother to care about me, or whether or not I‚Äôm happy, why should I? I can‚Äôt continue putting forth constant effort and getting very little back. I‚Äôm not happy. I want a man who has the ability to reflect on what he‚Äôs doing that is making his partner feel this way, and making effort to work on that. Or even bother to listen to me. Not tell me you don‚Äôt care and to ‚Äúdrop it‚Äù. Anything you‚Äôve ever told me makes you unhappy I *immediately* make the effort to ensure you never feel that way again. Me wanting the same thing isn‚Äôt asking for too much. If you don‚Äôt give a shit, that‚Äôs fine. I can‚Äôt force you to, nor should I have to. I feel like an idiot begging you to. And I‚Äôm not going to continue feeling like an idiot.‚Äù

He says, ‚ÄúYeah, honestly you lost me when you decided to say nothing to me on my birthday. So no, in regards to this conversation, I honestly don't really care that you're hurt. You didn't listen to how I was hurt at this start of this conversation and turned it back on me and how I'm not considering you. So at the start of the argument you didn't care how I felt, then you didn't care about how you'd further make me feel. So no, if you don't care, I don't care. Neither of us are going to get what we want out of this conversation.‚Äù And now we haven‚Äôt talked since. ",1,1735625900.0,AmIOverreacting,8,0.6,False

I was originally planning on building out a big, traditional 3-bin compost system, but I feel like compost pathways might be a better fit for my goals of being lazy and pissing on stuff. (And I'd rather use that wood for air pruning beds.) Basically, I will drop wood chips in \~2' pathways between my (non-raised) garden beds. I'll compost directly into these pathways, bury food scraps under the wood chips and dump bulk coffee grounds on them, etc. Then, every year or two, I can shovel the compost from the pathways directly onto the nearby beds. I assume nearby plants will even be able to access the pathway nutrients before then. I also plan to throw wine cap spawn in the woodchips to help break things down faster and have mushroom friends sing to me while I'm pissing.
