I love the whole process of making coffee. Iteratively learning new things and improving. I can say it's a hobby at this point. I think it's time to up my game a bit. The machine is great but lacks more control. I don't like the steam wand on it either. Looking for recommendations on my next machine. Max I can go is $1500-2000 (including grinder if separate).

I’m thinking things like restaurants, bodegas, coffee shops, corner stores, and so on. What would the process of collectivizing the businesses look like? Would the former owners be intended to any kind of payment or compensation, or is the business instead just confiscated?

And how would such a revolution deal with people who resist collectivizing?",1,1747788978.0,communism101,1,1.0,False
1krl7v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1krl7v5/my_partner_m21_and_i_f20_are_having_fights_over/,My partner M21 and I F20 are having fights over food.,"My partner and I have been dating for four months. We are both university students, and while I work part-time, he recently started working casually. He’s an amazing cook, while I, on the other hand, don’t enjoy cooking and am not very good at it. We come from different countries and cultural backgrounds, which also reflects in our food preferences.

He lives in an eight-bedroom apartment and shares the kitchen with seven others. Despite that, I spend most of my time at his place, and everyone there knows I’m his girlfriend. I’m not a very socially active person and tend to avoid people as much as I can.

From the beginning, he’s put a lot of effort into cooking for me. He’s mentioned several times that, because he cares for me, he thinks of me every time he prepares meals. Over time, he started expressing that he wishes I’d reciprocate—even if just occasionally—by cooking for him or spending some time in the kitchen with him.

We’ve had a few arguments about this. I’ve told him that I’ll cook for him, but I keep failing to follow through. I know this is my fault, and it has started affecting our relationship. Recently, we had a huge fight where he said, “What’s the point of having a partner who can’t cook for you?” That really hurt me.

To avoid placing more burden on him, I’ve started eating out more, which is costing me a lot. Yesterday, I made myself some sandwiches but didn’t make coffee for him—even though I know it’s part of his usual routine, and he always makes a lot of food for me. That added to the tension.

I understand that he puts a lot of love and care into cooking, and I haven’t been able to show the same effort. It’s not that I can’t cook at all—I can, but the dishes I make are often not to his liking. I’ve asked him if he’d like to try certain things, but we rarely end up agreeing on meals. He tends to prefer non-vegetarian, more elaborate dishes, while my style is simpler.

Ultimately, I don’t express love through food. But I know that’s how he expresses care, and he wishes to receive it in the same way. I’m struggling to find a way to meet his needs while staying true to who I am and managing my responsibilities as a full-time student and part-time worker.",1,1747788974.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Russ and Keaton really seem to care about their audience and humanity in general.,"I became a premium member 2wks ago. I was too intoxicated to call in the first week. They really seem to care about their audience so I took them up on their promotions and sent sign-up links to several friends and hopefully earn a free month..

I was the guy who flashed a bag of kratom and informed Russ that it was for opioid withdrawal, hits opioid receptors and in the coffee family. When Russ compared it to a speed ball I  called that a disservice to the og coke and heroin speedballs. Addict humor. I also spoke of working at Mintpressnews and moving all over the place every few years.



I then went to talking about living out of an extended stay hotel and trying to get into a medicaid billable dual diagnosis assisted living facility. Since in recent memory I've only been selling nootropics and homemade pre-workout stacks i make my own hours and try to catch all 3 shows a week since early 2024. Russ had a good joke about Piracetam (Russian pharma supplement I've sold) being like a Cronenberg movie

The regular call in guests seem to get genuine care from both hosts beyond our $5mo monthly subscription. They also have a whole lotta perks for $5mo.

My boyfriend and I will be in Costa Rica next month and I’m trying to come up with an itinerary to get most of what we want done, let me know if this looks fine, if I can add in or if I should take out anything! Any and all suggestions are appreciated!

Day 1: SJ to La Fortuna
* We actually arrive two days before but will be staying with a family member beforehand, so for our “vacation” day 1 we plan on saying goodbye to family, and picking up a rental car from the airport to head to La Fortuna early around 9am
* On the way to La Fortuna visit La Paz Waterfalls and Gardens 
* Hopefully make it to our Airbnb in La Fortuna by 5/6pm and just grab dinner and relax

Day 2:
* La Fortuna Waterfalls hike in the morning
* North fields coffee and chocolate tour in the afternoon

Day 3:
* Zip lining in the morning with Arenal Mundo Aventura
* Tabacon hot springs in the afternoon/evening

Day 4:
* Mistico Hanging Bridges 
* Bogarin guided trail

Day 5:
* Drive down to our Airbnb in Quepos, maybe stop for lunch in Jaco

Day 6:
* Explore Manuel Antonio National Park
* Playa Biezans

Day 7:
* Hike Nauyaca Waterfalls
* Spend the rest of the day visiting playa espadilla 

Day 8:
* Head back to SJO to catch our flight home

Notes:
* I don’t have much planned for Quepos/Manuel Antonio because I expect to just relax and enjoy the beaches more since we’ll do most of our adventuring in La Fortuna
* I wanted to also visit El Salto Rope Swing, could that be squeezed in?
* Similarly, I also wanted to visit Rio Celeste but I’m aware that it is farther away so would it be feasible?

It's an older hotel with more traditional Japanese interior. The first night was fine, slept well. Yesterday I encountered something really spooky.

I went to bed around 9:30pm. Didn't sleep very well and had an uneasy dream that I can't recall. Towards the middle of the night I woke up but couldn't move. Felt kind of pinned down and really uncomfortable. When I was finally able to get up, it was 2am. Then the TV turned on by itself... It was some Japanese reality show. I was very startled and checked for the remote but couldn't find it anywhere near me. It took a moment to realize what was happening. I sort of froze for a bit then did a bow and said ""sorry to disturb but please let me sleep, I need to get up early tomorrow"". Afterwards I searched everywhere for the remote and found it on the coffee table all the way across the room. Once I turned the TV off, it didn't turn back on. From then I tried to sleep again but couldn't really so I just put on some Youtube videos to have some distraction. I managed to sleep again at 4:30am and woke up for a day tour around 6am.

Now I'm on the day tour but starting to really think about what to do next. Strangely I was kind of calm the previous day, just uneasy. It's the first time I encountered this. ""They"" didn't seem malicious but I don't want to experience it again. What should I do? I'm supposed to check out tomorrow morning and go to Kanazawa. But thinking to check out tonight and take an overnight bus there instead?

Edit: I checked the hotel reviews and found only one review of a Japanese person also experiencing something spooky. Most other reviews were okay.",0,1747788452.0,JapanTravelTips,6,0.31,False

5:30 am. Get up.  Try to get a sip of coffee in me.  

5:40: Get kids up.

5:45: Give kids breakfast,, make lunches.  Tell kids to get dressed.

6:30 Ensure that both kids actually put clothes on and packed their backpacks.  Then, pack their backpacks because they didn't do it.

6:45 Make sure one kid didn't put toys in his backpack.

7:00 Get 1 kid on the bus, which often took longer than you would think because he kept coming back into the house to find something he forgot.

7:15 Bring kid 2 to school or daycare, depending on what age they were at the time

7:30 Drive to work

8:00-5:00 work

5:30-5:45 Get home after picking up kids

8:00 Bath time

9:00 Read stories, bedtime for kids

10:00 down time, watch a show.  Check email, etc.

12 midnight, maybe go to sleep, to be up again at 5:30

Rinse and repeat.  And I left a lot out!

Weekends:  Cleaning, errands, grocery shopping.  Baseball games.  Choir event.  Occasional fun.

That was my life!  Remember this when you feel like your kids have no time for you.  My kids aren't married and don't have kids so I am exempt!

A wide range of gift sets catering to different interests, hobbies, and demographics is essential. This includes options for skincare enthusiasts, foodies, home decor lovers, tech gadget fans, and more. Variety ensures that there's a perfect gift set for everyone on your list.

 “Are you sick of the apocalypse? Are you tired of unwanted Monsters and Undead wondering the streets? Well, you’re in luck! If you vote for \[insert name later\] we will personally exterminate the vermin from the streets after centuries of them roaming our godforsaken earth! Remember- “

The Television went quiet, silenced by a click from that of the remote. One of said monsters loomed behind the couch, towering over an unconscious human with the remote control in its claw. Its dark skin shone lightly with glowing freckled scattered across its skin. It carelessly threw the remote on another cushioned seat across the room. One of its clawed hands extended towards the unknowing human, the freckles star-like upon its dark navy skin. At least… that’s what the stories said stars looked like… The human suddenly awoke with a start, jumping away from the hand which had been inches away from his face. He fixed his groggy eyes on the monster and froze before eventually relaxing and opening his mouth to speak, slight annoyance in his tone and expression.

 Thal, the fuck are you doing?”

The human grumbled, rubbing his dark eyes groggily as his mind slowly woke up. It was always quite a startle to awaken and see Thalorian’s pure white eyes staring straight back at you. And those horns? Why did he HAVE to sharpen them to such a keen point again?

“I was trying to wake you up so you could get off my damn couch”

The monster, now known as ‘Thal’, replied, crossing his arms over his chest in a disapproving manner and startling Aari out of his thoughts. He sounded irritated, which wasn’t a usual thing that was detectible in his friend’s usually neutral tone, his expression blank as always. He was wearing a loose-fitting hoodie and jeans as per usual, narrowing his demonic white eyes at the long-haired male.

“You passed out AGAIN. Go to your OWN bed and pass out THERE”

Thal grumbled, watching judgementally as Aari sat there, eventually understanding the situation and wordlessly leaving the room with Thal’s judgmental eyes trailing after him. The monster eventually let out an irritated sigh once Aari was gone and left the room himself, his boots making a soft thudding sound against the floorboards as he entered a worn-out kitchen. The monster’s thick tail remained still behind him, stiff with the emotions he sought to keep his emotions buried.

Thal eventually paused before a window, his eyes shifting to look outside. The sky was a crimson red and there was a lack of a sun, despite it being around midday. The landscape was baren and there were all sorts of rubble and trash littering the street before his decaying apartment.

His inhuman sight allowed him to see straight through the pitch darkness that any normal human was forced to see, and he managed to spot a large dog-like rat. It scurried across the street, its purple eyes luminescent against the dark scene. The monster kept his eyes trained to the… Thing, feeling the emptiness in his stomach grow slightly to a painful degree as the creature picked something up with its creepily humanoid teeth and retreated down a collapsed storm drain.

*‘Could have eaten that…’*, the monster narrowing his eyes at the storm drain. He was suddenly drawn to his large tail lashing back and forth and almost smacking into a bench. Thal stopped it forcefully and scoffed in slight annoyance, It was like his damn tail had a mind of its own. An object in his pocket suddenly started vibrating and another tinge of annoyance filled his being.

The monster eventually pulled out the object, scoffing when he saw the display name upon the screen and reluctantly answering. He put it on speaker and dropped the phone onto a countertop with a light clatter, speaking with a new tone of annoyance in his voice.

“What do you want, idiot?”

He stepped away from the phone and opened the refrigerator, his eyes scanning the contents in search for breakfast as he had not eaten yet.

“Woah… Who pissed in your coffee, ‘Thalorian’?”

A feminine voice asked teasingly, a hint of snarkiness in her tone as she spoke. That only ticked him off further, the use of his full name proving to worsen his mood. The monster pulled a container of raw meat out of the chilled metallic box and slammed it down on the bench beside his phone.

“Listen here, ‘Ashley’. I’m not in the fucking mood and I’d prefer it if you just spat it out now.”

Thalorian snarled, leaning over the glowing screen and glaring at it subtly. This was out of character for him and ended up pulling the female into line for once, his tail beginning to flick back and forth irritably behind him.

“Oh… uh… You good, man?”

She asked, concern shining through her usual snarky attitude and genuine care and gentleness in her tone. She was rather annoying and cold majority of the time, but it didn’t mean that she was completely heartless.

“I’m fine. Just had a bad night”

Thal murmured, running a hand down his face and leaning against the counter. Breakfast had managed to disappear from his thoughts, his growing pain silenced instantaneously by the memories of the night previous.

“Okay…was it a dude?”

Ashley asked curiously, the same softness in her tone remaining as of now. She was close to him, and it was safe to say she knew more about him than anyone else. Which was an impressive feat considering how closed off he usually was.

“Not this time”

He eventually responded again, shaking his head slightly to rid the thoughts from his mind. The monster was suddenly reminded of his hunger again and his stomach groaned painfully. He stood up from the bench and reached over to open the container, pulling a slab of the bloody mutant-cow out. The meat was slightly purple-ish and dripped with a deep red liquid, cold and thick.

“Oh, a chick then. Anyways, we have another mission later tonight if you’re interested?”

His mood instantly lightened up at that and the thought of breakfast was yet again removed from his mind. The Monster set the meat down again and began asking questions, his curiosity peaked and the tip of his thick tail beginning to flick back and forth in excitement, a subtle smile pulling at his usually still and unfeeling lips. After all, he was half human, half fiendish entity. Why WOULDN’T he like the blood shed?

He finally recalled the food once again and picked up the slice of meat yet again. Instead of placing it on a pan to cook, he brang it to his mouth and ripped a chunk out of it with his sharpened teeth, occasionally exchanging ideas and plans with his accomplice.",1,1747788172.0,writers,1,0.99,False

Can I use half and half instead of heavy cream? I expect it will result in a thinner sauce, but will it wreck the flavour? Is there a way to un-wreck it? Is there something I can do to make the half and half caramel thicker? Or is the answer to all of this just “Go to the damn corner store, pay the damn ADHD tax and buy the damn heavy cream.”",2,1747788163.0,AskCulinary,3,1.0,False

I get it in every part of my body, arms, legs, stomach, back, scalp, neck, tongue, ears, eyes, everywhere. Some days it's worse than others, and there have been periods where it went away almost entirely for a couple of weeks/months. It does sometimes feel like a blood flow issue, because if I raise my arm or even just slightly pinch one of my limbs, it starts. For example when I kneel down for a bit my feet go completely numb. It gets A LOT worse when I consume coffeine, like from energy drinks (I don't drink coffee). And it gets worse when I sit or lay down for extended periods of time. I also get twitching skin all over my body, mostly in my face. When it's really bad my hands cramp together and I can't move them properly. If I exert too much stress on affected muscles, they feel like they're ripping apart, but otherwise the tingling isn't painful. And today I noticed that my vision is flickering when it's bad, it looks like a ""vortex"" of sorts, hard to describe. I also believe I feel cold more easily than I used to.

I'm male, 26, don't take any medications, do take various supplements at the moment (most of them because of this issue, trying to see if I have a deficiency), and eat a vegan diet. I've been to multiple doctors and to a neurologist, blood tests have been made (one regular test and one specifically for vitamin B12), but they have been fine. The doctors either don't know what could be the cause, think it's a psychological issue (I'm very certain it isn't, more info in the next paragraph), or blame it on veganism because ""god intended us to eat a bit of everything"" (ugh). I've been vegan for 4 years now, and everything was fine for the first 3 years, so if I have some sort of deficiency, I really don't know what it is. I take magnesium, iron, folic acid, iodine, zinc and B12 supplements at the moment. B12 is the only one I've taken before this started happening, and I tried laying it off to see if it makes a difference, but it didn't.

I've had important exams last year, so it initially got chalked up to being caused by stress, but even when they were over it returned and it's getting worse now. I've always been a pretty anxious person, but I never experienced anything like this before. And while I have been in a bad state mentally in the past, I've been doing fine this last year, especially after the exams were over. The past 6 months have actually been very easy-going for me. I also get lots of sleep. I do spend almost all of my time indoors and sit down a lot, but I do exercise regularly with a treadmill (or at least I used to, hard to do it right now).

Hello, not a pro (home) baker by any means, but I wish to make Strawberry flavored Cream scones. Most of the recipes I come across use slices/chunks of real or freeze dried strawberries and are ""Strawberry scones"" not ""Strawberry flavored""

I came across one such recipe, which would lead me to needing 1/2 cup of freeze dried strawberry powder - that comes out to about $18 so I can't be doing that.

The recipe I plan to base it off of uses 3 cups of flour. As far as freeze dried strawberry powder, I'd be willing to go up to 4 tbsp per recipe, would 2-4 be enough to flavor a scone? What if I went with Strawberry Nesquik, how bad would that turn out? Or Strawberry extract?

Edit: I'm trying to recreate a scone I got from my local coffee shop a couple years back, but they no longer carry them. The baker they came from no longer lives close, whom I've emailed asking if there was any chance they could give me the recipe for personal use... and got ignored :D

>Must-have #1: 16 Gram Basket  
The 16 gram basket of the E8 is very important. It’s much harder to get a balanced shot out with only a 10 gram basket that is built in the E4, ENA 4, and ENA 8.

>\---  
The E8 is the winner due to the crucial 16 g basket that you need for more balanced espresso shots.

Clearly, not many machines have a basket of that size, and Jura seems to actually be the only one that has a size of 16g.

Is this actually true? If it is so crucial, why no other manufacturers actually offer brewing units of that capacity or bigger? Is it really that much harder to get a balanced espresso shot with smaller baskets?

I generally only drink espresso / doppio, and I'd like to maximize the experience. There are couple of things I don't like about Jura though (not the price, I can afford the E8). I don't really care about brewing time, I could brew twice if I wanted a doppio, that's fine.

This kind of pain was contorting and twisting my gut so much, I had to keep leaning onto my left buttock for relief. 

I must have done it so many times, I caught the attention of the guy sitting next to me. Roman Hemlock who was half asleep, dark blonde curls hanging in half lidded eyes, his chin leaning on his fist. He shot me a look. I couldn't tell if it was *Are you okay?* or *Can you stop moving around so much?*

From the single crease in his brow, the slight curl in his lip, I guessed the latter. 

It's not like Roman was helping. 

For half the class, he'd been tapping his foot on the floor, then his chair leg, and to complete the orchestra, his fingers joined in, tap, tap, tapping on the edge of his desk. 

I didn't know if it was a bored thing, an ADHD thing, or he was trying to keep himself awake. It was easy to tolerate without the pain, but *with* it, the boy’s incessant tapping was more akin to a dentist drill splitting my skull open. 

I already felt nauseous, the sad looking chicken nuggets I forced down at lunch making an unwelcome appearance at the back of my throat.

It was too fucking hot, the stuffy summer air glueing my hair to the back of my neck. The material of my shirt was making me cringe, sticky against my skin. 

Tipping my head back, the lights were too bright. Every sound was *too* loud. Imogen Prairie, who was sitting behind me chewing her gum a *little* too loudly. 

Kaz Samuels scribbling notes like a maniac. 

I could hear every stroke of his pencil, every time he paused, looked up at the presentation, and continued writing. 

When I leaned forward in my chair, I could smell exactly what Isabella Trinity had eaten for lunch, the stink hanging in the air.  

It became a case of sucking in my stomach and taking slow, deep breaths. 

I’d never had these kinds of stomach cramps before. But it didn't take me long to figure out *what* they were.

I was yet to start my period at the grand age of sixteen, which meant this was it. 

After countless sessions with the doctor, and feeling like a social outcast among my group of friends who started their periods in middle school, it had finally happened. 

The cramps in my gut that felt like my torso was being ripped apart, was in fact me entering womanhood. When my breath started to quicken, my mouth watering, I raised my hand, biting my lip against a cry. 

*Fuck.*

Something lurched in my gut, a wave of nausea crashing into me.

*I was going to throw up.*

“Mr Brighton.” 

Roman spoke up before me, waving his arm. “Can I use the bathroom?”

The teacher’s answer was always the same. Which was why I had been crossing my legs for the entirety of the class, unable to focus on anything but my gut trying to twist itself inside out. 

Mr Brighton leaned against the wall, his eyes glued to the PowerPoint awash in our faces. We had been staring at the exact same slide for maybe five minutes now, and our physics teacher was yet to speak, his gaze somewhere else.

Mr Brighton was my Dad’s age, a greying man in his early fifties who always wore the exact same suit with the exact same stain on his collar. 

The man was about as interesting as watching paint dry. 

Normally, I would drift off myself, lulled into slumber by the low drone of his voice. 

But the pain ripping me apart was keeping me awake. 

“Mr Brighton.” Roman said, louder. His voice snapped me out of it. “Can I use the bathroom?” He paused, exaggerating a loud sigh. *”Please?”*

The teacher straightened up, folding his arms. 

“Mr Hemlock, you know the rules. Why didn't you go before class?”

“I didn't *need* to go an hour ago, did I?”

“You will no longer need to go to the bathroom, Mr Hemlock.”

Roman made a snorting noise.

“What?”

The low murmur of my classmates collapsed into white noise.

Glancing at the clock, I was anticipating the school bell. 

The sickness swimming in the pit of my belly was reaching dangerous territory. 

**2:52pm.**

Something ice cold trickled down my spine. 

It was 2:52 the last time I checked, and five minutes had surely passed.

This time, I waited a whole minute and counted the seconds under my breath. The clock still didn't move. The ticker was frozen halfway between three and four. 

Slowly, the same realisation began to hit the twelve of us. The clock on the wall had stopped. But it wasn't the only thing that had stopped. The cool breeze drifting through the window was gone. 

The sound of birds outside, and the cheer squad practising their routine. 

Everything had stopped. Trying to ignore a sickly slither of panic twisting its way through me, I checked my phone under my desk. There was a text from my Mom lighting up my notifications. When I tried to swipe it open, nothing happened. My lock screen was frozen, stuck at 2:52pm.

With my hands growing clammy around my phone, I stared at the time, willing it to move, to flick to 2:53. 

But nothing happened, the numbers stubbornly staying at 2:52.

“What the fuck are you talking about?” Roman’s voice brought me back to reality, though I was sure I'd dropped my phone. I heard it hit the floor with a sickening crack. Whatever he was saying, though, faded into dull murmur, when I turned toward the window. 

Something was *wrong* outside.

The cheer squad were nowhere to be seen. 

Being on the top floor gave us a front row seat to their practice sessions.

I stopped watching when their flyer did a death defying flip, almost breaking her neck. *2:52pm.* I couldn't see the cheer squad. But I *did* see Jessie Carson mid-sprint across the track field, strawberry blonde curls suspended in a halo around her. 

I could see exactly where she had frozen in place, her left foot hovering off of the ground, her right foot driving momentum. It wasn't just Jessie who had stopped. The dirt she was kicking into a cloud behind her was hovering, caught in mid-air. 

Studying the faces around me, my mouth went dry. 

Roman Hemlock, mid-argument with our physics teacher. 

His eyes were wide, lips curved into what would have been a yell. 

Fuck. 

Was I the only one?

But then Roman blinked, and I realized the boy wasn't frozen. He was trying to think of a comeback. “What do you mean I won't need the bathroom anymore?”

“Mr Hemlock, please lower your voice.”

“Why? You can't dictate to me when I do and don't need the bathroom, dude!”

Moving onto the rest of my class, the others were still moving.

It was too quiet, though. 

Yes, Roman was still tapping his foot. 

Imogen was still chewing her gum. 

Kaz was still scribbling notes like a psychopath. 

But they were the *only* noise I could hear. 

I wasn't the only one confused. The classroom had pricked with a sense of urgency. Kids were checking their phones, their gazes glued to the clock. Even Roman, who was still arguing, was starting to notice. I watched his gaze lazily roll to the clock on the wall. 

I pretended not to see his cheeks visibly paling. 

We had all come to the exact same terrifying conclusion. 

**2:52pm.**

Time had come to a halt, and somehow, we had *not*.

“Is that clock broken?” Roman interrupted, leaning forward in his chair.

Kaz twisted around, settling the boy with an eye-roll. 

“Check your phone, dumbass.”

“I broke my phone.” 

Imogen threw her iPhone at him, narrowly missing hitting him in the face. 

“Everything is frozen,” She said, her voice shuddering. “It's not just the clock.”

I waited for Roman’s response. For once, though, he was speechless. 

“Well done, Imogen. That is correct.” Mr Brighton spoke up, tearing a piece of paper from a workbook and striding over to the door, glueing it over the glass window. When we started to protest, some of us were shouting, while others bursting into tears, he calmly took out his key and locked us in. 

I should have been surprised that our teacher had spontaneously decided to take his entire class hostage, but the rumor mill had been churning. 

According to Becca Jason, the guy’s wife divorced him and took his kids. 

I could feel myself sinking into my chair, phantom bugs filling my mouth. 

So, this guy had nothing to lose. 

Taking his place in front of his desk, the man settled us with a patient smile. 

“From now on, you will stay inside this room.” He said. “In case you haven't noticed, time is currently frozen at fifty two minutes past two. The thirteen of us are tucked into the twenty first second, and will be, for the foreseeable future.” 

I could tell the others wanted to argue, but we couldn't deny that time had stopped. Kaz was staring down at his frozen phone, Imogen hyperventilating behind me, Roman glaring at the clock, chewing on a pencil. We wanted it to be a prank, a joke, some kind of glitch in the matrix that would fix itself. 

But then a whole minute passed by. Followed by another. Kaz threw his phone on the floor, hissing in frustration. Imogen let out a wet sounding sob. 

Roman’s pencil split in his mouth, slipping from his fingers. 

We couldn't pretend it wasn't happening or call our teacher out on his BS, because it was everywhere around us. 

The sudden absence of outdoor ambience, birdsong, planes flying overhead, and traffic outside the school gates. Everyone and everything had stopped, and we were the only ones left. 

This was a nightmare, surely. 

My physics class were some of the most  boring and pretentious people in the school, and somehow the world had been reduced to the twelve of us inside our classroom. 

We were scared, of course we were. But reality had stopped making sense, crashing and burning in a single second. We had no choice but to listen to our teacher. “Now, before you freak out, it may not feel like it, but the twelve of you have  *also* stopped.” 

Mr Brighton held out his own hand, and placed it on his heart. 

He was right. 

I was so busy trying to understand what was happening, I had failed to realize my period cramps were gone. 

“Do me a favor, and press your hand over your heart.”

“You mean like, in a culty way?” Imogen whispered. 

“Obviously.” Roman grumbled, halfway out of his seat. He was hesitant, though, in case our teacher was armed. It only took one glance from our teacher, and he slumped back into his chair. “This crazy fucker clearly wants to play mind games with us.”

“No, I'm just asking you to feel for your heart.” 

I felt for mine, and there was nothing, my stomach twisting. 

Roman stabbed his fingers into his neck, feeling for a pulse. 

He tried his wrist. 

Then his heart. 

*Nothing*. 

“The twelve of you are currently in a state of stasis,” the teacher explained to us, “You are not alive, nor are you dead. Your bodily functions are also on pause, such as your heartbeat and your pulse. In this state there will be no need for food and water, or going to the bathroom.” 

His gaze found a ghastly looking Roman, who looked like he was going to faint. “Your minds, however, as you can see, are working as usual.”

“But *why*?” Imogen demanded in a shriek. 

Mr Brighton’s lip curled. “I would rather not answer that question.”

“Because you're lonely.” Roman spoke up. He swung back on his chair, narrowed eyes glued to the teacher. 

“Your wife and kids left you, so you're asserting power over a group of sixteen year olds. Which is kinda fucking pathetic.”

Mr Brighton’s expression darkened, and something slimy crept up my throat. 

The worst thing any of us could do was threaten him. He had taken kidnapping to a whole new level, and we were alone with this psychopath, trapped inside a second. I waited for the man to stride forward and attack the kid. But he didn't. 

Instead, the teacher leaned back on his desk. “Yes.” The man nodded. 

“I suppose you could say I am.”

“But why *us*?!” Kaz hissed. 

“Because you are *children*.” Mr Brighton responded casually. 

He straightened up, taking slow, intimidating steps towards Roman’s desk. The rest of us leaned back. I tried to pull my desk with me, but it was glued to the floor. Frozen. Mr Brighton’s shoes went click-clack across the hardwood floor. 

“You are right,” the man said in a murmur, “I *am* lonely. My wife and kids *did* leave me, and I have nobody left to control. I have  nobody else to contort and use to my advantage.” Reaching Roman’s desk, he leaned in close until he was nose to nose with the kid. 

“Congratulations, Mr Hemlock. You have just earned yourself detention.”

Roman stayed stubbornly still, but he was visibly afraid. I could see him very slowly backing away. Roman was all bark and no bite. He was a loud mouth, sure, but he was also the least confrontational person in the class. 

“What?” He spluttered. “You trap us in a *time loop* or time trap, or whatever, and you still want to act like a teacher?”

“Stand up.” The teacher ordered. 

“What if I don't?”

Mr Brighton’s expression didn't waver. “You said it yourself. I can and have trapped you inside a single second. What else do you think I'm capable of?”

Roman stood, kicking his chair out of the way.

“What are you planning on doing to me, old man?”

The teacher maintained his smile. “Stand up straight, and close your mouth.”

To my confusion, Roman Hemlock did all the above. 

He straightened up, and closed his mouth. 

“Do not fight me.” The teacher said calmly, “Do as you are told, and follow me.” 

The boy did exactly as instructed. 

His jaw slackened, that rebellious light in his eyes fizzling out. 

I think that's when we all collectively agreed that going against this teacher and trying to escape was mental suicide. 

“I will use Mr Hemlock as an example to all of you,” Mr Brighton said, turning to the rest of us. “If you break the rules or are derogatory in any way, you will be given detention.” 

He grabbed the boy’s shoulders, forcing him to walk towards the supply closet. Roman moved like a robot, slightly off balance, his gaze glued to thin air, like he was tracking invisible butterflies.

""Your time in detention will depend on the severity of your rule-break.” He opened the door, gently pushing Roman inside, and following suit. When the door closed behind them, there was a pause, and I remembered how to breathe. 

Kaz Samuels slowly got up from his desk, inching towards the closet. 

“This guy is a certified nut.” He announced. 

He turned towards us. “Whatever he's doing to Hemlock, we’re probably next.”

“He stopped time.” I spoke up, my own voice barely a croak. “He’s capable of anything.”

“But *how* did he stop time?” Kaz whistled, tipping his head back. The boy was slow, his fingers grasping each desk as he slid down the aisle. “He said he was lonely, right? But why take it out on us? What did we do to him?”

“Check his desk for a weapon!” Imogen whisper-shrieked. 

Kaz nodded, striding over to the man's desk, his hands moving frantically, shoving paper on the floor. He took an uncertain seat on the man's chair. 

“There's nothing here,” he murmured, lifting stained coffee mugs and ancient textbooks. “It's just…test papers.” Kaz ducked from view, trying the drawers. 

“He's a fan of Pokémon,” he said, “There's a tonne of Pokémon cards,” Kaz straightened up, running a hand through his hair. “No sign of a weapon, though.”

He picked up a ruler, waving it around. “This could work. If we plunge it in his eye.”

“Try his laptop!” Imogen was halfway out of her seat. 

Kaz did, slamming the keys. “It's locked.”

“Look *harder*!” Ren Clarke threw a pencil at him.

“I am!”

After a minute of searching, Kaz grabbed a single piece of paper. 

He held it up, and I squinted. 

It was a list of our names, with several of them highlighted. 

“Fuck.” Kaz dropped the list, his expression crumpling. The stubborn bravado facade transforming him into our sort of leader dissipated, hollowing him out into exactly what he was. Just a scared kid. Kaz’s hands were shaking. 

“Mr Brighton’s got a hit list.” He whispered. “He's going to kill us.”

“How do you know that?” I found myself asking.

Kaz slowly dropped into a crouch, picking up the paper and holding it up. 

“Look.” He pointed to a capitalised name at the top of the list highlighted in red.

**ROMAN HEMLOCK.**

There were six names highlighted in red, including mine. 

**CRISTA ADAMS.**

As if on cue, Roman’s cry rang out from the supply closet, suddenly, freezing us all in place. Kaz jumped up, adapting the expression of a deer caught in headlights, eyes wide, almost unseeing. 

He fell over himself to tidy up the desk, putting everything back where he had found it, sliding the list between a pile of test papers. Kaz took slow, stumbled steps back, his feverish gaze glued to the closet, before turning and making a break for it and diving into his seat. 

“Brighton’s got a hit liiiist,” Kaz said, in a mocking sing-song, “And we’re *all* on it.”

What followed was deathly silence. I think we were expecting Roman to cry out again. But when he didn't, the class started to stir. Some kids started praying to a god they didn't believe in, while others were in varying states of denial, trying to call their parents with dead phones.

I wasn't sure what parts of me *had* stopped, but I was still alive, still felt like my lungs were deprived of oxygen, my chest aching. 

I'm not sure how long I sat there, trying to find my voice, a shriek trying and failing to rip through my mouth. 

Being kidnapped and held hostage is one thing, but being imprisoned inside a single, never ending second, was an existential hell worse than death. 

Slowly, I pressed my palm over my heart once again. Then I breathed into my cupped hands. 

I was expecting it, but no longer being able to feel my own heartbeat and breath, was fear I didn't think was possible. The kind that glued me to my seat, hollowing me out completely until I was nothing, an empty shell with no heartbeat, no breath, no thoughts, except denial, followed by acceptance. 

And finally, regret. 

I regretted not hugging my mother goodbye before I left for school. 

I regretted acting like a spoiled brat when my parents refused to drive me halfway across the country so I could attend Coachella. 

I regretted stepping inside Mr Brighton’s fourth period physics class. 

Mr Brighton reappeared, slamming the door behind him and locking the boy inside. Part of me flinched, while the rest of me remembered not to move a muscle. I was barely aware of time passing. Or it wasn't. Time had stopped, so now long had I been sitting there? 

I could no longer measure the passage of time with hunger or thirst, and my body felt the same. I wasn't stiff or tired or achy. Looking out of the window, the sky was the exact same crystal blue, every cloud in the exact same place. 

Jessie Carson was still frozen mid-run, strands of dark red hair caught around her. 

“What's wrong with you guys?” Mr Brighton chuckled, and I twisted back to the front, a shiver writhing down my spine. “Why don't you give me a smile?”

The teacher returned to his desk, and I was already subconsciously sitting up straight in my seat, forcing my lips into a jaw-breaking grin, following Brighton’s instructions. In the corner of my eye, Imogen was sitting very still, forcing an award-winning cheesy smile, while Kaz grinned through gritted teeth. 

“Mr Hemlock just earned himself two weeks inside the supply closet.” he said casually, perching himself on the edge of his desk. The man studied each of us, taking his time to rip every shred of us apart. 

*Mind, body, and soul.*

I struggled to maintain my stupid smile, shoving my shaking hands in my lap. 

“Would anyone like to *join* him, or are you going to follow the rules?”

The rest of us stayed silent. I don't think any of us breathed. 

Our teacher nodded to Kaz, inclining his head. 

“Samuels. Are you all right?”

Kaz’s smile faltered slightly. He shifted in his chair. I could see sweat trickling down his right temple. “Uh, yeah.” He swiped at his forehead, like he couldn't believe he was sweating. “Yeah, I'm good.”

The teacher’s eyes narrowed. He moved toward his desk, and we all held our breaths. Mr Brighton seemed to study his hit-list, lips curving into a frown. 

His gaze flicked to the boy, and then the paper. 

*He knew*, I thought dizzily. 

Mr Brighton *knew*  the kid had been rummaging through his desk. 

But this was all about control. The teacher was using fear to control us, to manipulate our thoughts without having to get physical. He could have called out the boy right then, but Brighton was settling with mental torture instead. 

He just wanted to make my classmate squirm. 

Without a word, the man folded up the piece of paper and slipped it into his pocket. “Mr Samuels, you are sweating,” our physics teacher said, mocking a frown. “Are you feeling okay?”

Kaz hesitated, tapping his shoe in a rhythm.  

Being one of the smartest kids in the room definitely gave him an advantage. 

I could already see the cogs turning behind half lidded eyes. Kaz was weighing each scenario, sorting them into positives and negatives. 

The positives of answering would mean he was one step towards being in the clear, but there were two negatives. 

Brighton would question him if he had left his seat, and then demand how his hit-list had magically moved across the desk. 

Talking back was surely a rule-break, as well as outright lying. 

Opening his mouth would get him in trouble, either way, and Kaz knew that. 

So, he just nodded, forcing an even bigger smile. 

Brighton’s lips pricked, his gaze straying on Kaz. “Good!” He cleared his throat, turning to the class. Kaz slumped in his seat with a sharp breath, resting his head in his arms. If Mr Brighton noticed, he didn't say anything. “Ignore the sweating. It should stop, along with hunger and thirst.”

Our teacher seemed to be able to manipulate everything in his vicinity. 

*Time.*

*Minds.*

And slowly… contorting *us* into his own. 

In the single second we were trapped inside, I felt days go by in a dizzying whirlwind that was like being permanently high. When I stood up, I felt like I was floating. 

When I sat down, hours could go by, even days, and I wouldn't even feel them. I did try and count the days, initially, scribbling them on a scrap piece of paper, but somewhere around the thirteenth or fourteenth day, I lost count. The world around us never changed, in permanent stasis, and maybe that was sending us a little crazy. 

After a while of being stuck at our desks, Mr Brighton allowed us to wander the classroom, as long as we stayed away from the door. I lay on the floor for days, counting ceiling tiles. 

Sometimes, Imogen would join me. 

I couldn't sleep, but I could pretend to sleep, imagining a world that was back to normal. I didn't feel hungry, but my brain did like to remind me of food at the weirdest times. I was aware of weeks passing us by, and then months. 

I never grew hungry or tired, and my bodily functions were none existent. 

I couldn't remember what pain felt like, or the urge to go to the bathroom. Even the concept of eating and drinking became foreign to me. Putting something in your mouth and chewing to sustain yourself? 

That sounded odd. 

The only thing that *was* changing was our slowly unravelling metal state.

I don't know how it started. Weekends and Tuesdays blended together. On one particular SaturTuesday, I was hanging upside down from my desk, watching Kaz and Imogen doodle on the whiteboard. 

Kaz had a plan to escape, but after a while, his ‘plan’ to distract the teacher, had gone nowhere. After passing notes between us, the twelve of us had decided that we needed a weapon. 

That was maybe a month ago. I wasn't sure what mind games our teacher was playing, but Kaz Samuels, who we were counting on to be our brains, was slowly falling under his spell. Their game had been going on for three days. The two of them were having a *competition* to see who could draw the craziest thing.

Mr Brighton was at his desk as usual, marking papers. 

Imogen was drawing a weird looking ‘skateboard’ when the doors to the storage closet flew open. 

Roman Hemlock appeared, and to my surprise, wasn't a hollow eyed shell. 

He held up his hand in a wave, his lips forming a small smile. 

“Yo.”

Roman’s reappearance was enough to snap us out of it. Kaz and Imogen stopped arguing, the rest of the class going silent. I sat up, blinking rapidly.

I was sure our collective consensus was that Roman Hemlock was dead. 

Mr Brighton lifted his head and gave the boy a civil nod. “Mr Hemlock will be rejoining us,” he said, his gaze going back to marking papers. “Please make him feel comfortable. I'm sure he's very excited to be able to talk to you again.”

Instead of going to his desk, the boy immediately joined the others, snatching the marker off of a baffled looking Kaz, and drawing an overly artistic sketch of a penis. I wasn't sure what confused me more. 

The fact that Roman Hemlock had some serious artistic skills, *or* that he seemed suspiciously fine for someone who had been locked in the storage closet for two weeks with no social interaction. 

With my last few lingering brain cells still clinging on, I studied the boy. 

There were no signs of bruises or scratches. 

His eyes seemed normal, not diluted or half lidded. 

Unable to stop myself, I jumped off of my desk and joined the others, where Kaz was already interrogating the guy. 

“WHAT–” 

Imogen nudged him, and he lowered his voice, leaning against the wall. “What did he do to you?”

Roman shrugged, rolling his eyes. “Relax, dude. He didn't do anything to me.”

“Then what was that yell?” Imogen hissed. 

The boy cocked his head. “Yell?”

“You yelled out,” Kaz folded his arms, narrowing his eyes. He was already suspecting one of us had been compromised– or worse, brainwashed into compliance. Kaz stepped closer, backing Roman into the desk. “You cried out when you first went in there,” he murmured, “So, what was *that*?”

Something in Roman’s eyes darkened. “Oh,” He said, his lip curling. “That.”

Kaz’s expression softened. He rested his hands on the boy’s shoulders. “Yeah,” He whispered. “What did he do to you?” 

Imogen shoved Kaz out of the way, shooting the boy a glare. 

“You don't *have* to tell us, you know.” She said in a  small voice. “If it's too traumatising, or he did something you don't want to talk about–”

Roman cut her off with a laugh, and suddenly, all eyes were on him.

The remaining nine of us were eagerly awaiting an explanation. 

“Are you fucking serious?” 

When Kaz didn't respond, Roman gathered us in a kind of hustle, the four of us grouped together. I felt like I was on the football field. Still, though, if the guy’s goal was to look as suspicious as possible, he was doing a great job. 

Roman studied each of us, one eyebrow cocked. When Mr Brighton glanced up from his work, Roman shot him a grin, lowering his voice to a hiss. 

“You seriously think our fifty year old physics teacher has been abusing me in the storage closet?

“Then why did you cry out?” Kaz demanded. “Did he hit you?”

Roman stuck out his bottom lip. “I'm pretty sure he didn't hit me.”

“So, you cried out for no reason.” 

“Why are you covering for him?” Imogen poked his forehead. “Are you lobotomised?”

Roman wafted her hand away. “Stop prodding me, and no, I'm 100% good.” He backed away from us, like we were observers, and he was the zoo attraction. 

“I won't be, if you keep treating me like I'm senile.”

“Okay, fine,” Kaz sighed. “Just answer one.”

“Shoot.”

“When you first went in there, you made an unmistakable sound of distress–”

“Not this again,” Roman groaned. “Of course I yelled! I was shoved into a pitch black storage closet on my own! What, did you expect me to stay silent?”

Kaz didn't look convinced, Imogen nervously sucking her teeth. 

The boy leaned back, resting his head against the wall. His eyes flickered shut. 

“Stop looking at me like that, there's nothing to tell you,” he murmured, “Brighton didn't do shit to me. I was just freaked out.” Prying one eye open, he fixed us with a glare. “I am *so* sorry for reacting like a human. Next time, I'll make sure to attack him and pin him to the ground.”

It's not like we believed him. I don't think Roman believed himself. 

Something significant had changed in him. He was no longer argumentative, like half of his personality had been torn away. Roman set a precedent. Because once he was following instructions and walking around with a dazed smile, others began to follow. I can't remember how much time had passed since I thought about escaping. 

Days and weeks and months had collapsed into fleeting seconds I only noticed when I wasn't playing games. 

I wasn't aware of my own lack of sanity until I found myself, on a random SaturWednesday. I was laughing, gathered with the others on the floor, around a Monopoly board. The game had been going on for almost a week. 

Reality hit me when I was laughing so hard I tipped back. 

I can't remember why I was laughing. I think Imogen told a bad joke. 

“Hand it over.” Roman, who was the King of Monopoly, held out his hand, demanding my last 250 bucks. I remember noticing his smile, my foggy brain trying to find hints that he was in some kind of trance, or being controlled by Brighton. But no. His smile was real. 

Genuine. 

To my shock and confusion, so was mine. 

I wasn't in a trance or any type of mind manipulation. I was completely conscious. 

*Was this… Stockholm syndrome?* I thought dizzily. 

*Was I enjoying this?*

My thoughts were like cotton candy, disconnected and wrong, and they barely felt like my own. My gaze found Imogen and Kaz, the two of them sitting shoulder to shoulder, enveloped in the game. 

They looked exactly the same, their hair, clothes, everything about them staying stagnant. It was them themselves who had drastically changed. I had never seen them look so carefree. 

Imogen was a hotheaded cheerleader, and Kaz was the smart kid who gave himself nosebleeds from overworking himself. But now, they were laughing, nudging each other, caught up in an inside joke. Blinking slowly, my gaze strayed on them. 

Sure, it could be manipulation. It could be brainwashing. But it could also be real.

Kaz caught my eye, raising a brow.

“You good, Christa?”

Again, my smile felt real. Like I was having fun. 

“Good. It's your turn.” 

I picked up the dice, throwing them across the board.

Two sixes. 

“I can already see her landing on one of my hotels.” Roman murmured. He sat up, resting his chin on his knees. “As the clear winner, I have a proposition.”

Ignoring him, I moved my piece– immediately landing on Park Place.

“I'll give you 500,” Roman announced, “If you give up New York avenue.”

“That's all I've got!” 

Imogen nudged me. “Don't do it. If you give him New York Avenue, he only needs one more.”

“One thousand.” Roman waved the notes in my face. 

“My final offer.” 

When I reached for the cash, he held it back. 

“New York Avenue"", he said, with a grin. 

“And your pride.”

Reluctantly, I handed my only property over. 

Kaz threw the dice and moved his piece, and I half remembered we had an escape plan. “Community chest.” Kaz picked up a card. “Go straight to jail.”*

Roman spluttered. “That's karma,” he said, “For stealing from the bank.”

“You were stealing too!”

We had a plan. 

We had…. a plan. 

After discussing it in detail, Imogen and I were going to try and get onto Brighton’s laptop. It wasn't a perfect way to escape, but it was coherent. 

So, what happened? 

We were going to get out, so what… what was *this*? 

Kaz’s earlier words hit me from months ago. 

*“Mr Brighton *is* the thing keeping us here,”* he explained. *“If we kill him, I'm like, 98% sure we’ll go back to normal.”*

*“Okay, and what if he dies and we’re *stuck*?”* Imogen whisper-shrieked. 

*“I said 98% for a reason. Yes, there's a small chance his power will die with him. But there's a bigger chance that its effects will die when he does.”*

Ren nodded slowly. *“Right, and where exactly did you learn this information?”*

*“You'll feel a lot better if I don't answer that.”*

*“Okay.”* Ren gritted his teeth.  *“So, we just need to find a weapon, right?”*

*“And don't tell Hemlock,”* Kaz rolled his eyes. *“I don't care what he says, that boy definitely had his mind fucked with. Hemlock is a liability. If we tell Roman, he tells Brighton, and we’re screwed.”* Kaz nodded to me, then the others. *“Keep your mouths shut.”*

Presently, I wasn't sure the boy *wanted* to escape. 

Slowly, I rolled my eyes over to Mr Brighton, who had joined us to play. 

He was happily marking papers, taking part when he could. 

It felt…right. 

Not like we had been forced or manipulated, but more like he belonged. Part of me wanted to question why I felt like this, but I found that I didn't care. I didn't *care* that we were essentially dead, in a never ending stasis and stuck inside fifty two minutes past two. 

I stopped thinking about the outside world a long time ago. 

I couldn't even remember my Mom’s face.

I made my decision, dazedly watching Imogen throw a *chance* card at Roman. 

He flung one back, threatening to tip the board. 

*I wanted to stay.*

In the corner of my eye, however, someone was still awake. 

Ren, who had been sitting next to me, kept moving, further and further away. 

I didn't notice until he was inching towards our teacher, a box cutter clenched between his fist. There must have been a point when we found a box cutter, when we made it our weapon of choice. 

But somewhere along the way, I think we just… lost the longing to want to escape. 

I didn't see the exact moment the boy stabbed the blade into the man's neck, plunging it through his flesh, but I did *feel* a sudden jolt, like time itself was starting to falter and tremble. 

Mr Brighton dropped to the ground, and I found my gaze flashing to the frozen clock.

Which was moving, suddenly. 

Slowly creeping towards **2:53pm.**

Something sticky ran underneath me, warm and wet. 

Blood. 

Blood that was *running*. 

Roman’s half lidded eyes found mine, and he blinked, dropping the dice. 

Like he'd been asleep for a long time. 

**2:53pm.**

*We were free*. 

The cool spring breeze grazing my cheeks was back. I could feel my own heartbeat, sticky sweat on my forehead. 

And outside, Jessie Carson let out a gut-churning scream. 

More screams rang out. 

Down the hallways. 

Getting closer. 

And *closer*. 

For a disorienting moment, I don't think any of us believed we were free. 

Roman twisted around, his gaze on the doorway. 

The piece of paper the teacher had stuck to the glass slipped away. 

But Roman’s gaze was glued to the door, his cheeks paling. 

His lips parted into a silent cry. 

Following his eyes, I glimpsed a shadow.  

A shadow that was frozen at *2:52pm.*

**2:53pm**. 

“Fuck.” Roman whispered, stumbling to his feet. 

He turned to the rest of us, his eyes wild. 

“Get DOWN!”

I dropped onto my knees, crawling under a desk, the classroom exploding around me. 

**2:54.**

Blood splattered the walls, and I was crawling in it, stained in my friends. 

**2:55.**

I grabbed Mr Brighton's hand, squeezing for dear life. 

Roman joined me, his trembling fingers feeling for a pulse. 

A gunshot rang in my ears, rattling my skull. 

When Roman went limp next to me, I wrapped my arms around my teacher. 

“Mr Brighton, say *Stop*.” I whispered, when Imogen’s screams *stopped*. 

*He was so cold…*

“Mr Brighton! Take us back!”

Footsteps coming towards me, ice cold steel protruding into my neck.

I wanted to write it down so that I can explain what seemed like ""eating a normal amount"" and ""eating whenever I want"" before I started trying to gain.

For about a year I was thinking ""I'm trying so hard to gain weight, but nothing is happening"" and it's because I had days like this 3+ times a week. I need to make the following happen less than once a week.

I got up and it was Monday so I didn't feel like breakfast, and I had a coffee on the way to work and another coffee at work. I forgot to bring my lunch, but last week there was a work party so I had a cup of strawberry sherbet that was still in the work freezer and the protein shakes I always keep at work. I got home from work and had to immediately drive somewhere else, and I was starving, so I had a string cheese and got back in the car. Got home from the errand around 6pm and remembered I had a thing at 7pm so there was not time to cook and eat, so I had another string cheese. Finished the thing around 9pm, and now it was too late and I would need to get ready for bed soon so I had a granola bar, chocolate, and juice.

I used to do this almost every day. I would rush around to different things I had to do and just eat a snack anytime I felt so starved that I couldn't focus on what I needed to get done. Since I was just eating random snacks all the time, I felt like ""I can just eat junk food whenever I want and never gain weight"", but each of these snacks is like 60-200kcal. My total for the day ends up being less than maintenance or barely maintenance even though I feel like I was just snacking all day, because my natural tendency is to treat eating like something I need to squeeze in during the 5 minutes I have to use the bathroom and get back in the car. Since deciding to actually try to gain weight I've had a lot of trouble getting over this habit and actually spending the full 30+ minutes to eat an entire meal. It feels like a huge pain in the ass because I'm used to being busy, so making myself sit down is a change I don't really like.

Anyway, in the first year of ""trying so hard to gain weight"" I went from doing this almost every day to doing it a few times a week. I have cut off the gradual loss that I was experiencing, but I'm at the point where I need to dedicate my time to eating every day so that I don't have more than one day a week of rushed snacking. I basically have to treat it like a ""cheat day"" for people who want to lose weight and pick a day to overeat lol",1,1747786352.0,weightgain,0,1.0,False

1krkaf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1krkaf9/a_return_to_no_contact/,A return to no contact.,"Hi everyone. I’m really struggling, so thank you for letting me vent.

I (F33) was with my ex (M38) for 3 years before he broke up with me this March. He had a traumatic past—losing both parents young. When he repeatedly claimed his exes were always the problem, I just chucked it up to him having a rough past. I sided with him and listening to him talk about them for hours. 

I had told him early on I didn’t want to wait more than 3 years for an engagement. At 2.5 years, he asked for ring ideas and said a proposal was coming—but it never did. He told me I needed “to be patient and let it happen when it happens.” 

In February, we went on a road trip to Megacon with friends. I bought everyone tickets, but he woke up late and made us miss most of it. He mocked my driving, insulted a coffee I bought him, and embarrassed me in front of my best friend by saying his love language was “when she cleans the apartment.” When I said that was mean, he snapped, “Are you gonna sulk about this all day?”

I asked to talk the next morning, but the day we got home, he disappeared. No texts, no calls. When I finally reached him, he said he was out drinking with friends and would be home “eventually.” He came home drunk and told me, “I don’t think you’re my person,” and that he felt pressured by my desire for marriage. I tried to meet him halfway and said I’d stop bringing it up.

Not long after, I was flying out of state for grad school. He refused to take me to the airport because he “had to be at work,” even though I offered to go early. It broke my heart that he wouldn’t even say goodbye. Days later, he asked for sex. I told him I wasn’t emotionally there yet after the way he treated me at Megacon. He blew up—said I’d never get over it, claimed I was playing the victim, and that “love doesn’t need a piece of paper.” He said I was hurting him by expecting him to be someone he’s not.

When I got sick with a terrible cold before my trip, he ignored me. I knocked on his door needing help, and he texted, “It’s inappropriate to knock this late”—at 10pm, when I nearly needed to go to the hospital. My friend ended up helping me instead.

When I got back, I moved out. He became hostile, sent texts about what furniture I could take (even though I paid for most of it), installed cameras, and told me he’d bring in a peace officer during my move. He even locked the game room. No one had ever yelled or threatened him—he just wanted control.

After 2.5 months of silence, I foolishly reached out to express how hurt I was but that I wished him well. His reply?

“There are a lot of things I discovered about the person that exists within the shadows...and didn't like what I found. Please let this be the last time we contact each other.”

Admittedly, my anxious attachment made me insecure during our relationship. But I began to go to therapy more. I worked on giving him space. I begged him to go to therapy and he freaked out, saying he will “go when he’s ready.” I realize now how condescending and mean he was during the entire relationship. I just ignored the red flags because I loved him. 

And now, I think I’ve realized that he never actually loved me. The detach and discard has left me feeling broken. It’s like I never knew him.

1krk9us,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1krk9us,Bringing specialty coffee on a cruise.,"I recently went on a Royal Caribbean cruise. This is my first time in my adult life. With now being into specialty coffee, the coffee on board the ship was my biggest concern. I needed to have a game plan to address this. I decided that I would bring my French press set up and my ZP6. I also attempted to bring a scale, which was useless with the boat moving and floating.

Originally this trip had me planning on bringing my normal daily v60 or my switch. I ended up being really happy I decided with a French press due to the scale issues of the moving boat. 

Overall I stuck with the Hoffmann method for brewing. For my brew method, I had my French press pretty dialed in to certain reference points to make it so the scale was not necessary. I knew exactly where 900 g/ish of water was on my French press when mixed with my 55 or so g/ish of ground coffee. I ended up using a cup in my room and had a bag that was already at 55 g that I was using up. This ended up creating my coffee reference point for coffee. I knew 900 g on the French press was due to previous brewing.

Brewing water was probably the most difficult part. Just because I did not have my normal coffee brewing water. I ended up using bottled water from the ship. I don't exactly remember the name of the brand. But it did not make the coffee taste too terrible overall it was way better than anything that was available on board the ship for coffee.

For coffee I had a solid line up of my favorite SW Coffees rested a month prior to the trip. Overall it was such a joy to wake up and make a cup for my wife and I to enjoy on our balcony. Clean up was the only hassle with the smaller bathroom sink to work with.",11,1747786114.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

I’ve been living the remote semi-nomadic life for 2–3 years now, and my company is calling me back to the office in mid October. So I want to take full advantage of these final 4–5 months working remotely by living in places with world-class hiking access.

I work Monday through Friday, 7 AM–4 PM (PST) I live out of Airbnbs, short-term rentals, or tent camp out of my Subaru Outback (could throw a mattress in there but I'm fine dispersed tent camping). If I camp, I work from coffee shops or libraries — I just need Wi-Fi or cell service for my hotspot within ~20 minutes of where I sleep. I can spend $2,000/month or less (basically acts as my rent) or go dirtbag-style if needed. I’m perfectly fine bouncing around every 1–3 weeks

My goals this summer:
1. Pick a place where I can do after-work hikes (4 PM–10 PM) a few times per week
2. Do epic weekend backpacking trips. I get off work at 4 so ideally it's within an hour or 2 where I can knock out some miles Friday night. Then hike Saturday and hike back out Sunday night. I can take a couple long weekends if I want. Saving some of those for some week long longer backpacking trips. 
3. Live in beautiful, wild places that are hard to access once I’m stuck in an office

I've done a lot of places the past couple years. I spent a month in Kalispell area to go to Glacier on the weekends (and some day hikes in the area), in Yosemite foothills city area for the valley in spring (I'm from SoCal so this is my home area) camped around Utah, etc. My favorite has been an Airbnb for a month in Alaska simply because there was so much unbelievable hiking to do and sundown wasn't until 11pm so I could do epic hikes on work nights. I'm tempted to go back there but it seems all the good stuff is hard to pack in a weekend. Have done just weekend stuff in the Tetons, Banff, and some others. 

Places I’m considering bouncing around every couple weeks 

	1. Eastern Sierra, CA (June/July) – Tons of weekend backpacking options that I've done a bit of. Maybe Tahoe is best for after work hikes and mammoth area for backpacking? 

	2. Beartooths – place I haven't been. Considering maybe the red lodge area? 

	3, Tetons – great camping outside the park. Close enough to hike?  Places to work? 

	4. Canmore/Banff, Canada – Explored for a weekend, loved it. But expensive; I’d camp. Any good Canada recs? 

	5 . Crested Butte or Ouray, CO – steep hikes, big views, not sure about post-work trail access or epic backpacking 

6. Back to Alaska 

International (for August/September?): 
	I've never been hiking abroad. But thinking it could work. I would be working 4pm-11pm which would leave weekday mornings/afternoon for hiking 

- Switzerland or French Alps – Thinking Chamonix or somewhere. Worried it won't be a wilderness feel but could be cool to do parts of the Tour de Mont Blanc
	•	Norway? Could be a wilderness feel with decent transportation? 
	•	Iceland? No idea where to base out of

If anyone is interested in giving me feedback, it's not perfect, but I really like it","I have just woken up. It’s completely dark where I am. A drop of moisture pulls me out of my sleep. I stretch my arms, but they are quickly stopped by wood. I push harder, but nothing works: I’m firmly trapped in this wooden thing.

I fumble to feel the moisture, trying to sense where it’s coming from. With a bit of luck, I manage to locate the spot where the water has seeped through, and I push against the wood, softer in that place. The wood cracks, and a little dirt falls on me.

I then slide in that direction, through the dirt. It’s difficult, but after some time, I finally sense a glow above me. I continue moving through the damp earth. Finally, the sun touches me. I take a deep breath, capturing each breath of CO₂, stretching my leaves to catch those precious rays.

The heat, the light, everything feels strange. I’m not quite sure what surrounds me, but I feel that this isn’t the warmth of the sun. The light is too constant, too white, and doesn’t warm as it should. I extend a leaf toward it, uncertain. All around me, I sense slightly fogged glass walls, almost invisible, as if the air is contained in a dense and relentless bubble. The air is heavy, saturated with moisture, and the warmth is tepid, regular.

I feel a vibration in the ground, a presence other than mine. I don’t perceive the roots of others around me, nor the usual sounds of forests or fields. There’s no wind, no insects. No rustling, nothing. Only this strange, artificial smell, a mix of fertilizer, plastic, and metal. My environment is like a silent cage, an enclosed space.

I extend a leaf in one direction, then another. Beyond the glass, a figure passes. A human. Tall, bipedal. It stops, approaches. Its face is hidden behind a transparent plate. It scribbles something on a tablet, then leaves, almost forgetting me.

I was born in a greenhouse. But I was no ordinary plant.

The days pass, or perhaps hours, hard to tell under this frozen light. My body adjusts to this world without wind, without sky, without rain. My roots stretch carefully into the warm earth. But soon, I encounter a limit, a substance I don’t recognize.

Then, one morning, I sense a change. A vibration in the air, a sharp chime, followed by heavy footsteps. Muffled voices. The greenhouse door creaks open, and a human returns, this time accompanied by another biped, shorter, hunched, with hair as white as the clouds I’ve never seen.

The man approaches slowly, his eyes squinting behind small square glasses. He kneels in front of me, extends a wrinkled hand, and lightly brushes one of my leaves with his fingers. The air vibrates around us, heavy and tense.

They speak. The other human nods, taps on his tablet. Then an agreement is made. With surprising gentleness, they lift me from the table where I was.

I feel no pain, no fear. Just a slight concern about what will happen to me. They wrap me in a container and carry me out of the greenhouse. The outside air hits me, cooler, livelier. Sounds, smells, unsettling vibrations surround me.

I am placed in a large metal cage with glass windows. The air is different. It smells of dust, worn leather, and a strange nostalgia. The old man settles beside me, moves a few things, and a hum starts. The world moves around me, blurry and fast, shaking my still-folded leaves, as if asleep.

Then, at last, the large cage stops, and I am taken out. The sky welcomes me, vast, changing, infinite. Clouds slowly run above me. The wind brushes against me, and I shudder. It is strong. The air smells of living earth, dead leaves, invisible animals.

The man walks along a path bordered by old trees, passes a house with a rusty roof, then stops in front of a large open yard. As far as the eye can see, a field undulates in the wind, and distant hills.

He digs a hole in a cleared corner, at the edge of the field, not quite in the center, but not too far off either.

Gently, he plants me in the soft earth. Not in a pot, not in a box. In the ground. The real thing.

He feels the earth around me carefully, as if searching for something, then murmurs while pouring water:

“Come on, big one… grow for the next generations.”

He stays there for a moment, sitting beside me, silent. Then he slowly gets up, walks away, and enters his house, leaving me alone for the first time.

But I am not really alone.

I feel, everywhere around me, life.

Beneath the surface, tiny vibrations tickle my roots. Insects, worms, perhaps even small mammals move beneath the earth, stirring the material, gently aerating the soil. I perceive the silky brush of a millipede, the jerky beats of a beetle slipping on a damp clod before moving away with a scraping sound. Another insect, smaller, stops against one of my roots.

At the surface, ants pass in line, carrying twigs, avoiding my young stems with uncanny precision. A greenfly climbs up my stem, stops, tastes me, then is carried away by a ladybug.

Finally, I unfold my first true leaves. A thin membrane still connects them to my young buds, but they begin to capture the sun’s energy with newfound eagerness. The sky seems immense to me, almost overwhelming, but also reassuring. I begin to sense the rhythms of day and night. The rising heat of the morning. The light breeze of the afternoon. The shiver of dusk. And, in the darkness, the living cold of night.

Each day, my leaves stretch further, my roots dig deeper, branch out, explore. The earth here is not perfect—sometimes too dry, sometimes too compact, but I like it all the same.

Birds come. At first, they fly over me without stopping. Then one morning, a tit briefly lands on a nearby branch. It looks at me, tilts its head, curious. Then it flies off. Later, a sparrow lands nearby, picks at an insect at the foot of my budding trunk, then flies off singing.

I still don’t fully understand what’s happening around me. I’m discovering.

Spring breathes a new energy into me. Each day brings a little more light, a little more warmth. The earth slowly warms, the rains come often, sometimes violently, but always welcome. Buds swell, burst into wider, sturdier leaves. Around me, the grass rises, insects buzz, birds return with their morning songs.

Summer, scorching and vast, gives me my first real test. The sun strikes hard. My leaves curl at midday to conserve water. But I hold firm. My roots, now deeper, search for moisture where the surface becomes dry.

I then discover something strange: deep down, the earth is not just nourishing. It holds memories too. Ancient roots, dead wood, forgotten stones. Autumn brings me a bittersweetness. I feel the light decline, the days shorten. My leaves change color, from bright green to a pale yellow, tinged with ochre.

I slow my growth, conserve my strength. Birds still pass, but more hurried, more silent. The old man sometimes comes to sit beside me, a book in his lap, or simply to watch the hills.

Winter almost lulls me to sleep. The cold freezes the surface of the earth, but deeper down, it remains warm. I retract my sap, close my pores, let my leaves fall one by one. It is not death, no. Just a pause. A slow breath, a waiting. Snow covers me, protects me. The winter silence is complete. But beneath the earth, my roots continue to grow, imperceptibly.

Then spring returns. And with it, the light. The energy. The drive. And so the cycle of the seasons continues.

Each year, I grow a little more. My trunk thickens, my branches multiply, my leaves form a light canopy. The birds return for good, nesting in me. Insects buzz from morning to night. Even a squirrel climbs me one day, leaving little scratches on a young branch.

And always, the old man comes. Less often, more slowly…

One day, he doesn’t come back.

The wind waits. The sun too. The days pass, and the rusty chair remains empty. The house seems even quieter, the shutters closed, the garden overgrown.

Then, one morning, new sounds break out.

A lively engine. Young voices, animated. Doors slamming. Hasty footsteps. It’s like excited birds discovering new territory.

People have moved into the house. It’s a young couple.

They pass by me without truly seeing me, too busy moving boxes, repainting walls, cleaning dust-covered windows. But soon, they start to explore the place with more attention. One morning, the woman walks to the field, a steaming cup in hand, and stops in front of me. She looks at me for a long time, then approaches to rest a hand on my trunk.

“Look at this,” she says, “it’s younger than the other trees. I wonder who planted it.”

He shrugs, a hammer in hand.

“A memory, probably. It’s well placed. We could put a bench right here.”

A few days later, the man comes out of his workshop with an old, slightly crooked but charming white wooden bench. He places it at my base. They often come to drink their morning coffee there. Sometimes they read. Sometimes they say nothing at all. Sometimes they laugh loudly. Sometimes they cry softly.

I keep growing. My trunk thickens, my canopy spreads. The shade I cast is bigger now, and cooler. The birds have returned for good. Titmice, blackbirds, even a buzzard, soaring over the field.

And each spring, when my buds open again, I remember.

The first darkness. The strange light. The greenhouse. The wrinkled hand. The journey. The field. The man who planted me, whispering:

“Grow for the next generations.”

And I grow. For them. For him. For me.",1,1747785765.0,writers,1,1.0,False

The proprietary papers for this thing are an inconvenience so I want to make every brew count as much as possible. I have not had great luck getting consistent or good pourover extractions in the past and have been trying at it pretty hard since last year, so any advice that someone wants to afford me in general or with specificity to this dripper, I'd really appreciate. A breakdown of my brewing equipment below:

  
•1zpresso ZP6 grinder (keep trying to calbrate burr lock at zero but it seems to shift with usage; burr lock currently 3 clicks below zero; have not been wowed by this grinder like so many so wondering if I have a dud)

•Saki Baristan electric kettle

•Monthly 5-bag Rogue Wave subscription (the more beans I have, the more I can practice; might reduce the quantity if I can become consistently capable)

•I distill my water with a stainless steel Megahome countertop distiller (porcelain nozzle; running two carbon sachets) and remineralize it with half a packet of Third Wave Water per gallon.

I've had amazing pourover in cafés years ago and know what good extraction *should* taste like, but now have autoimmune considerations so I don't really go anywhere given the virus still being out there and I'm trying to bring some of that joy back into my life but it's frustrating to now be nailing the aroma every other time I attempt a cup but not see a similar clarity translate into the taste.

Im very proud of myself and for once don’t hate what I see in the mirror. 

But since reaching this point, I can’t find the motivation to exercise anymore except for trail running/hiking on the weekends. 

The initial reason I was working out diligently was because at my highest weight I started experiencing heart problems and was admitted to the ER with zero answers as to what was going on. 

I told the cardiologist maybe I could fix the issues with diet and exercise and lo and behold I’m here now. 

I first walked a lot my first year, then did weights at the gym the second year, and this last year I’ve incorporated dumbbell weight training, jogging, and some yoga/stretching.

A couple weeks ago, husband and I did a 10.7 mile hike that absolutely killed me at the end of the day that I took an entire week off of exercise. 

Since then, I haven’t had the motivation to workout again and I just got a pull up bar bench set up in my office. I 100% got the eating part down too so I’m not over eating and I’m eating right every single day. It’s just the desire to want to workout that is slipping.

Also, if it helps at all, I also don’t really drink coffee or take pre workout all that much due to issues with sleep and anxiety. 

Any and all advice is appreciated and welcomed as I really want to get motivated again, but I don’t understand what’s going on.

But she purposely doesn’t take her meds and falls into that incredibly difficult person I once knew years ago. No matter how gently I try to explain that it’s incredibly obvious she’s off of her meds because of her behavior she will take it so, so badly. She thinks that the meds make her someone else. No. They make you who you were before your mental health illnesses and they make you who closer to who you are supposed to be. They’re both you, one just isn’t constantly triggered and angry then sad then happy. It sucks man I feel bad but rn I can’t . I’m in an important position in life working towards real long term goals right now, and I’m grateful for having a shelter. But having to deal with this just ain’t it chief . My eldest sister is similar but she takes her meds more often than not (although she’d probably attack me if she knew that I thought this). Recently my mother’s been sleeping super lightly and going insane if you close a door too loudly or you turn a light on in the other room and a photonic beam enters her room I mean what are you talking about, Seriously? You cannot be screaming at me for doing something completely normal. I hate this. I can’t feel sympathy for light sleepers who act like THAT. All I did was walk to the kitchen dude I didn’t destroy the entire world. And a lot of times she does things that just completely ruin my mood. For example constantly talking about LITERALLY ANYTHING I do to everyone 😭. Dawg I didn’t have lunch because I wasn’t hungry, I’m not a stick man, I’m far from it I won’t just dissipate into thin air if I miss a meal. How is that enough for you to somehow find a way to get angry at me and insult me I am so perplexed and irritated at the same time. Who tf are these ppl anyway idgaflyingf abt them and I’m pretty sure they don’t about me either. All these little things just add up.

Aaahhhh I just want my own place but I’m broke and don’t want to waste money on renting in the city. Most of the problems I have with my two elder siblings are caused by my mothers yapping behind my back. The number of misunderstandings they have about me is insane. And quite frankly if you are that easily manipulated I don’t want to bother untying all those damn knots. Then they ask why I don’t talk to any of them. Man I don’t wanna 😭 just leave a mf alone pleeeaseee.

He had a bad run but now he’s just sitting there doing nothing and I appreciate that. Don’t get me wrong I don’t just shut off my family I go through all the pleasantries with genuineness . But ever since my late teens I knew communication was a rocky road leading to nothing but ASS. Every time I tried, we just slept it off and continued the next day like nothing ever happened. And no positive change occurred in anyone including my crusty aah. When constructive debates turn into full blown arguments 100% of the time, then a mf starts to wonder, why even bother.

Here it be:

  
STEP 1: at about 30 minutes before your normal sleeping time, load up on acetylcholine, drink apple juice, eat m&ms’s drink coffee, and eat apple pie. These foods are fantastic in increasing acetylcholine levels in the brain.  
  
STEP 2: Watch a tv show or listen to music while falling asleep. With music, keep the volume about halfway up and on tv keep it at 15  
  
STEP 3: Drink about as much water as your height subtracted by 1.5 (if your 5 feet drink 3.5 cups of water if you 6 feet drink 4.5 ). If you have ever wet your bed before just set an alarm or make yourself wake up using your body’s internal alarm clock.  
  
STEP 4: Lay down in bed and think about past dreams ( if you’ve had lucid dreams make sure to think about those as it’s even better than just thinking about dreams). Try image rescripting where you remember a dream and imagine you got lucid in it  
  
STEP 5: cycle through your sense. first do your vision. while having your eyes closed focus on the blackness behind your eyes for about 30 seconds try to look for floaters or a static like image. Then focus on the hearing for about 30 seconds listen to the tv show and try to focus on the dialogue. Then focus on the touch for about 30 seconds. Cycle through these until either you can see floaters or see static (this should happen at about 3-4 cycles) or you’ve done 4-5 cycles.  
  
STEP 6: fall asleep while doing the reverse blinking method. Keep your eyes closed and about every 10 seconds open your eyes and focus on an object in your room just enough so you can see it clearly then close your eyes. Repeat this for as long as you need to get tired then just fall asleep as normal.  
  
STEP 7: Now you’ve woken up after about 3-4 hours. First do a reality check get up and hold your nose and try to breathe through your nose (do this about 3 times because your might still be dreaming if you still can’t look at your hands to see if you have any extra fingers if you still don’t see anything unusual, your probably actually awake but if you can breathe through your nose or see extra fingers you Lucid! If not lucid, continue the steps) think about if you remember any dreams if you did write them down, you might have already had a lucid dream and just forgot about it already. If you can’t remember any dreams that’s okay. Get up and use the bathroom if you use the water technique, if you set an alarm, just stay in bed. Turn the tv show you had on while you had your first half of sleep back on. Keep the volume at about 15 on the tv, halfway on music.  
  
STEP 8: Once again, load up on acetylcholines but this time, avoid coffee.  
  
STEP 9: Think about past dreams and lucid ones if you’ve had them, do image rescripting once again.  
  
STEP 10: repeat step 5  
  
STEP 11: once that’s done, repeat step 6

what you’ve just read is the extended 11 step process. I’ve come up with one that’s only 8 and for me works just as well.

  
STEP 1: at about 30 minutes before your normal sleeping time, load up on acetylcholine, drink apple juice, eat m&ms’s drink coffee, and eat apple pie. These foods are fantastic in increasing acetylcholine levels in the brain.

  


STEP 2: Drink about as much water as your height subtracted by 1.5 (if your 5 feet drink 3.5 cups of water if you 6 feet drink 4.5 ). If you have ever wet your bed before just set an alarm or make yourself wake up using your body’s internal alarm clock.

1krk21p,https://www.reddit.com/r/barexam/comments/1krk21p/ny_bar_exam_experience_a_case_study_in_neurosis/,NY Bar Exam experience: A case study in neurosis,"Hi all - Since reading similar stories helped me while studying and waiting for results in J24, I figured I'd write out a play by play of my bar exam experience that may be helpful to those studying, and which I hope doesn't make everything worse. At the very least, I hope it's entertaining.

Pre-Bar Studying:

I started studying for the exam full time 4 months before with Themis. From the early Contracts lessons, I felt pretty hopeless. I had no mental flowchart to understand the arc of the law. Themis also gave a quiz very early on, and taking that quiz was the first of many times I thought ""I am going to fail this exam""

Because of my fear and frustration, I re-listened to the contracts lectures another 2 or 3 times on 1.5x or 2x the speed. There were times that I felt like I was absorbing the material that I was listening to, but it didn't feel like it was sticking. Looking back, the reviews probably did help, but I think what is actually more helpful is a spaced repetition pattern of learn, test, review and test again.

When I finally started to feel like I was understanding the basics of contracts after I think a week or two, Themis started throwing more things at me and multiple things at once. This was another point in the process where I thought ""If this exam was only Contracts, maybe, MAYBE, I could pass. But I can't learn everything."" I stuck with it though, with the same pattern that I had done in Contracts of fear and feelings of failure, followed by a complete review and re-review of the audio. I also started to review my outlines again, especially the final review and MEE outlines since the lecture outlines are just a meandering series of stream of consciousness (sort of like this post).

I followed this pattern for weeks, and then Themis started throwing in MPTs. This was yet another ""I can't do all this"" moment. This was an entire skill I had to learn and master.

Over the course of months, I spent time in the jumbled Themis schedule trying desperately to stay on track. I did eventually have to take days off starting around the one month mark for my mental health, but then I'd remind myself that there wasn't much time. What really got to me during these months was the MEE practice. I felt like I knew absolutely nothing. However, one of the things I did do was I did the MEEs from memory from the beginning. No ""open book"". I would study the outline of the subject, then go into the MEE cold and try to answer using an IRAC structure. I also spent a lot of time reviewing the model MEE answers. This was eventually helpful because the MEEs have repeated themes, and one of the Themis model answers was particularly helpful for the exams. In fact, of anything Themis actually helps with, I would say it was the MEEs.

Eventually, Themis got to giving UWorld practice questions, and one of the things I immediately thought was ""I wish I had done these sooner"". As I mentioned - learn, test, review, test again. If I had done even 5 or 10 questions a day from the beginning when I was studying each subject, then doing them toward the end would have felt more like a review instead of a realization about how fucked for the exam I was.

At a certain point, and again something I wish I had done earlier, I also bought GoatBarPrep. I think Themis and Goat complemented each other nicely. Themis gave me the organized structure of the law, and Goat kept me from sinking into a deep depression and made studying funny. While his lessons are unhinged, there are specific instances of questions I read during reviewing his lectures that got me actual questions correct on the MBE. If Themis was the broad overview, Goat was the frying pan over the head saying ""If you see this scenario, pick this answer."" If I were reviewing for the bar again, and I had 6 months, I'd probably start reading the GOAT modules early on.

Toward the exam, I started to get really anxious. Every time I learned something new, it felt like I unlearned two things I had learned previously. Yet another time where I thought ""This is simply too much and I am going to fail."" But I was too deep in to quit. I did however start to take noticeably more mental health days. I once took 4 days off in a row out of pure exhaustion. 

Finally, finally toward the end, I could see areas of law starting to crystallize. CivPro started making sense. Contracts made sense. Hell even Property made some sense. Evidence maybe never did. 

I also started doubling down on practice exams. The last two weeks, I was doing around 50 questions on UWorld a day. I won't claim I went back and read ""even the right answers"", since I don't have whatever Hermione used to repeat her days in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I did at least make an honest effort to review my wrong answers.

Looking back, I wish I had started UWorld earlier and had done 5 to 10 questions a week per MBE subject until I had gotten through all the MBE subjects, and THEN started doing mixed tests of 50 at a time. I am grateful for doing the Themis MEE reviews and particularly reading the model answers. I wish I had read the GOAT modules earlier. I am glad I read and reread the final review outlines and MEE outlines on Themis. I am glad I spent time trying to at least learn the broad structures and the arcs of the law. And I am grateful I at least did half the recommended MPT practices, although the timing structure they give is unrealistic.

Exam Day 1:

I got to the exam center not knowing what to expect. On the subway ride, there were 2 very stressed out girls rapid fire listing rule statements. ""Oh fuck I didn't remember that one"".

I'm glad I arrived as early as I did, because I forgot how Type A law students are. Everyone arrived early. I at least got in with enough time to get to my seat, get settled in, and have a panic attack.

First Session - the MPTs:

Who was it that said that everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face? Yea, that guy took the bar I'm pretty sure. 

Themis tells you to spend x amount of time reading, x amount of time outlining, and x amount of time writing, but on exam day you can forget about the time outlining. Not realistic. I do support their strategy to read the task, then laws and cases, then facts. This helped. But after you do that, it's pretty much time to start writing. I remember looking at the clock and thinking that it might be broken. How did reading take 40 minutes? Lesson to future takers: add in a few extra minutes to panic and have to talk yourself down.

As I started writing, I did feel it was possible to put something pretty organized together without outlining and just YOLOing directly since I had practiced some MPTs. One thing to note, this isn't the time to be a gunner and try to get a clerk position at SCOTUS. Hit the basic arguments. Then make it look pretty format and header wise. THEN go back through and see where the arguments can be super duper good.

I barely had enough time to finish both MPTs using the above strategy for each, and evenly splitting the time between each.

Session 2: The MEEs

After the MPTs I was actually feeling sort of ok. The MPTs were my most dreaded subject, and the bar was actually kind of ok testing them.

So imagine my surprise when I opened my MEE booklet when time was called to read an MEE designed by someone who has dedicated their life to tormenting bar examinees and has apparently sworn an undying hatred toward us. I remember thinking ""What the actual fuck is this nonsense?"" Like seriously, the facts made no sense and seemed like someone got AI drunk. I couldn't tell if the test was smart and I was stupid, or vice versa. I did think how fucking badly I hated the whole bar exam at that point.

Ok, 5 minutes down, nothing written. I talked myself into starting. And surprisingly, I remembered a sprinkle of a rule here. A sprinkle of a concept there. Was I making up what the rule was named? Absolutely. Was it at least ""minimum competency""? I sure fucking hoped so.

One thing that struck me at the end of the first MEE was that there were at least hints of what the bar examiners wanted. Themis had told me to work the facts more in my graded MEE review, and finally on exam day I sort of got what they meant. One of my law professors used to say: ""If you're weak on the facts, pound on the law. If you're weak on the law, pound on the facts. And if you're weak on both, pound on the table.""

Well I pounded on those fucking facts. You like that facts? 

Sorry.

Anyways, it's true. You can work the facts to back into a rule. And I did that.

After that, the majority of the MEEs were relatively straightforward. And by relatively I mean 2 of the 3 subparts of each them were a pretty straightforward rule statement and analysis. However, a few of them did have one subpart where the psychopathic author of the first MEE decided to make a guest appearance. I remember being mad that they would test on such a small footnote area of the law for one of them. I guess torturing us with learning 80 different bodies of law wasn't enough.

I answered the MEEs very formulaically:

The issue is [restatement of the sub question].

The rule is [desperate attempt to correctly state a rule statement].

The rule is [met/not met] because [copy pasted facts (yes, actually do this)] followed by an actual analysis that surprisingly counts for very little of the writing.

Therefore/In conclusion, the issue resolved [in this way].

Very, very formulaic.

As mentioned, what I think Themis does best is getting you ready for the MEEs, particularly if you spend time reading the model answers. Try to get a feel for the exact structure of the model answers. Don't get too caught up in Themis's unrealistic formulations of the rule statements in them though. Your rule statements will be 69% crappier, but so will everyone's. Just try to focus on the structure of the answers of each subpart.

That doesn't mean you don't have to memorize rule statements. You do. There isn't a way around that, especially for the ""easy"" MEE topics. You can't just make everything up. But you can sort of make some things up in order to fill in where your knowledge isn't 100%. Also, if you don't know the rule, then yes, make something up and IRAC. I did and many others have. 

On exam day I felt like I did relatively well on 3 MEEs, sort of did the best I could on 2, and fuck the first one. 

GOAT always said ""On Day 1, just try to do well enough to stay in the game."" I can't say leaving the exam I felt totally confident I had done that, but I also didn't feel like I got an F. I remember on the subway ride home thinking ""There is at least a chance I got a 66% on those"", and trying to map out in my mind how an average score would work ""Ok if I got a 5,5,5,3,3, and 1, then that's almost an average score of 4.... ok then maybe I got a 6,5,5,3,3,1.... but what if I got a 3,3,3,3,3,1?"" and so on my conversation with myself went. Luckily I live in New York and no one was shocked by this behavior on the subway.

Exam Day 2 - The MBEs:

Before the exam, I had felt probably the best about the MBEs. I was averaging around a 70-72% on UWorld, which I actually didn't know what pretty good (protip: If you ask reddit if 70% is good, prepare to be called a douche). Whatever you do, however bad the exam feels, just make sure to come back on Day 2 and do the MBEs.

Well, Day 2 I came back, earlier than Day 1, and fuck me if everyone else didn't also arrive earlier. I did have the thought that I'd study in line a little, and review some of my wrong UWorld questions, but I ended up behind someone who told me ""If we don't know it now we never will"", and I got too embarrassed. 

By Day 2, the other stressed out test takers, the security procedures, your seat, the clocks, it isn't all brand new. You're not a starry-eyed bar examinee. Instead, you are dead inside and running off a combined total of 6 hours of sleep between 2 nights but you didn't drink coffee in case it gave you diarrhea on the subway ride to the exam.

Same as Day 1, I got to my seat early, and since I could not for the life of me find a pencil sharpener the night before in my house, pulled out my 50 sharpened pencils and prayed to all of my dead relatives who I thought owed me favors that 50 would be enough to get me through the MBEs. Oh, also, you DO NOT have to bring your computer the second day. I got paranoid and brought mine. 

MBEs Session 1:

Now I'm staring at the clock and hearing the proctor count down to what feels like an event of me shitting myself. 5 minutes. 2 minutes. 30 seconds. Test starts and I open the book.

At least the questions felt familiar at first, but my strategy of feeling confident about 3 out of every 4 has turned into feeling grateful when I know the answer to 1 out of every 6. Seriously. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. This can't be real. I am guessing on wayyyyy too many of these. Like seriously. I studied just to come and guess? Fucking seriously? SERIOUSLY?!!!! 4 MONTHS OF MY LIFE GONE SO I CAN JUST DO WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE IN THE DAMN FIRST PLACE WITHOUT STUDYING???

Ok, calm down. Breathe. Some of these look familiar. Yes I know that one. Ok I know that one too. Wait I know that one. Ok why are all the answers B? Like, they are all B??

This continued until I had gotten through the questions. Surprisingly, I ended up finishing the first round an hour early. I'm usually a go hand in the test I finish early and leave type of a person, but the bar seemed as good a time as any to actually go back and review my questions. So now I'm flipping back though this damn book and checking my questions. And you know what? Maybe I did guess, but these answers aren't half bad. Actually reviewing them I feel like, ok, I had a reason for picking the choice I did.

I manage to get through all the questions and even end up changing a few. I know, I know, don't change them, but I am relatively satisfied with my choices.

MBEs Session 2:

Similar vibes to the first MBE. Again, why am I literally just guessing right now? Like this is just me here guessing. Also, some of these questions are written in what feels like Martian. Seriously I feel like the exam is now just a lab experiment, and I'm the lab rat. Maybe these are experimental questions. Maybe not. Keep guessing.

Toward the end of the second session, everything went blank in my mind. I lost myself and time and space no longer existed. I was one with the exam center. Ok snap out of it. Fucking focus. This is the exam. This IS the EXAM!

I managed to somehow finish my test, and I had 50 minutes left, so i also went back for a review. This time I ended up changing maybe 10 answers, and one I inexplicably marked completely wrong which was probably during the time I had achieved Nirvana. I felt a lot less confident about my answers.

Leaving the exam, I did exactly what you shouldn't do. I immediately started Googling shit. I immediately started asking Chat GPT to train me on the law. I felt about 50/50 walking out. I remember thinking ""I could definitely see myself having failed that"". It was overall much more difficult than I was expecting.

I spent the next month hyper anxious and randomly recalling MBE questions and checking answers. Eventually, I had compiled a list of what I got right, wrong, and maybe. I do not recommend doing this. It didn't help.

I also started having bad nightmares. I didn't wake up in time for the exam. I got my score back and failed. They randomly lost my exam. Random dreams like this.

Waiting was excruciating. While this subreddit can be pretty damn funny sometimes, it also killed me to see people describe their exam experiences and their mindsets. I couldn't help trying to compare how I felt. I saw people who thought they passed and failed. I saw stories of people who felt confident about passing and passed. I saw very few stories of people who felt like me, felt they might have failed, and ended up passing. The more time that passed after the exam, the worse I felt. Anecdotally, people with similar experiences with me were coming on here and reporting that they didn't pass. It ate at me and I felt anxious having to tell people that I didn't pass. I tried to exercise and I drank more than I should have. 

Finally, we got to October, and the rest is the stuff of bar exam lore. 

There were rumors of a mythical gray address bar, and rumors of NY BOLE telling people the address bar was going gray. There was infighting. There were memes. And there was a lot of self doubt. A lot. I was about 70/30 that I failed by this point.

The prophecy of the gray address bar was finally fulfilled (although based on February BOLE has fixed this), and that night I also learned of the NY Courts method to guess the exam results early based on error message tea leaves (that turned out surprisingly to be true). 

Results came at 1 am, and based on the gray address bar and people literally registering early and getting an attorney ID, I woke up at 2 am and checked.

Final score?:

UBE: 323
MBE: 159.5 (which mades the written portion a 163.5).

Hair and weight lost and blood pressure points added: A veritable fuck ton.

I hope reading this experience helps future takers in some small way. 

This exam sucks. 

I have no idea why I did well and others didn't. This isn't a team sport sadly. I know I worked and studied harder for this than for anything I have ever done in my entire life, but I know that others also did and didn't quite get there this time.

I guess if I have one parting word of advice, it's not to beat yourself up too much, and not to obsess about things out of your control. Take the test seriously. Study hard. Study as hard as you can. And try to learn and internalize. But take pride in having made it this far.

If you passed and came back to read this: Congratulations!

And if you didn't pass, just remember: You didn't pass YET.

I’m in a bit of a tricky spot and would really appreciate insight from anyone who’s gone through a similar situation or knows immigration policies well.

I’m currently an F-1 visa holder and was on post-completion OPT. My OPT started on February 9, 2025, and my 90-day unemployment period would have ended on May 10, 2025. I managed to secure a volunteer position starting April 2nd to stay compliant.

While still on OPT, I filed for adjustment of status (green card) through marriage to a U.S. citizen. My I-485 and I-765 (based on pending I-485, category C09) were both filed. My C09 EAD was approved on April 23rd, and I received the new EAD card on May 4th.

Now, here’s the confusion:

	•	My DSO told me I’m still in F-1 status until I get a green card or leave and return on advance parole. She suggested I continue meeting F-1 requirements even though I now have the C09 EAD.

	•	I want to stop the volunteer role and look for paid employment using my C09 EAD.

	•	I briefly got hired at a coffee shop using my C09 EAD but quit for personal reasons after one day.



Questions:

	1.	Am I still required to follow OPT/F-1 rules (like the 90-day unemployment limit), or does my C09 EAD supersede that now?

	2.	If I stop the volunteer position, is that a violation of my F-1 status even though I have work authorization under C09?

	3.	Should I report this job or end of volunteering anywhere (SEVP, school DSO, etc.) now that I’m working under C09?

	4.	Is there any official USCIS guidance or federal resource that confirms when the OPT rules no longer apply after receiving a C09 EAD?

I’m doing everything I can to stay compliant but I’m getting conflicting information. If you’ve been through this or have legal knowledge, I’d really appreciate your guidance.",1,1747785413.0,USCIS,4,1.0,False

at the age of 15 self sustaining na ko and yes ako na nagpapa aral sa sarili ko by that age. ano source of income ko? nung 15 ako nagpa pilot ako ng mga mobile games haha. kinakaya naman ang time since puro module lang that time and nasa public school pa ako. pero nitong mga college na, di ko na alam saan kukuha ng source of income since apat lang inapplyan ko na university. upd and ang napasa ko is engineering pero architecture talaga gusto ko. di ko na naisip i grab ang mag shift since sabi ng friends ko there, mahirap. so wala akong choice kaya nag private nalang ako. 

long story short na susustain ko naman tuition ko since may discount ako dahil sa scholarship. and kumikita naman ako sa affiliate sa tiktok haha. ngayon, may lamesa naman pero yung kapatid ko palagi gumagamit. given na demanding yung program ko so syempre makalat, di sapat na parang 1/4 lang yung space ko so ending, parati ako nasa coffee shop nag pplates. palagi ako nakikipag sapalaran mag commute, makipag sapalaran sa rush hour at makipag agawan ng space sa mga cafe para lang makapag plates. kahit bumili ako ng lamesa, walang pag lalagyan since sobrang init sa 3rd floor. pag pinagawa ko sya aabutin ako ng 100k since scratch talaga sya. saan naman ako kukuha nun di ba?

tapos, yung parent ko kinuha pa rito yung pinsan kong babae para pag aralin. edi ang ending yung pinag iipunan ko na ipagawa wala rin kasi yung 3rd floor binigay na sa pinsan ko. like dito na sya for good. diba ang bait ng nanay ko? to the point na di cinonsider na malalaki na kami and conscious na sa mga bagay bagay. hahaha. edi ending sobrang sikip dito and wala na talaga akong space for my acads. 

nabanggit ko na at the age of 15, solo nalang ako sa expenses ko kasi super complacent ng parents ko na kaya ko sarili ko etc. akala ko good thing sya in the long run pero hindi. sobrang draining. need mo palagi mag isip pano ka makaka diskarte i sustain needs mo. thank God kumikita kahit papaano by endorsements. tapos dadagdag pa tong pinsan ko sa bayarin. anyway ako nagbabayad ng wifi namin and kuryente since matino naman kita ko sa mga raket ko. 

ngayon, di na ako nag babayad. di na ako kumakain samin dahil nagtatampo ako sa decisions ng parents ko. walang pansinan almost a week na. nakokonsensya ako yes, pero every time na nakikita ko yung pinsan ko naiiyak ako kasi kawawa sha at the same time, ako rin. ang swerte ng mga studyante na pag aaral nalang pinoproblema. habang buhay ko talaga i eenvy mga student na may supportive na parents at emotionally available.

For background I’ve been out of work since Jan bc I was getting sick a lot so the company I worked for moved me from my school position to be a new place everyday and I cant handle the inconsistency. Anyways I am very overwhelmed and anxious starting here. Today was my first training day bc yesterday was more orientation and the expectations. When I got home yesterday I cried for 1.5 hrs trying to regulate and finally had food and sat outside and was able to calm down. Today I worked 6am-11am with only 10 min break. There’s making coffee, cashier, cooking (with a fire stove and the oven was on so it’s very warm back there), food prep, and cleaning. And sometimes you do this all by yourself which is crazy to me. 
I had therapy today and she’s a great therapist. She is starting to explain to me about ableism bc I tell her how I feel I cannot keep up and no one understands why things are hard for me. 
After today my mom told me she thinks I need a doctor, nutritionist, or psychiatrist help bc I get shaky and “can’t even work 2 days a a coffee shop”. My dad says just have fun w it don’t take it too seriously but sounds like it sucks so whatever I wanna do. 
I guess I’m just looking for someone to relate to? I really try my best. I feel like I can’t succeed in this world even tho I can be smart and kind and gentle (which is why I worked w kids). The sensory overload and recovery time or spoons spent doesn’t seem to be understood by the people around me. I feel embarrassed and at the same time just wanting to do what’s best for me, ideally without shame..

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavor.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1747784515.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

I looked at the bag and it says they use beans highest in polyphenols.

But here’s what I noticed:

• their instagram bios are formatted the same way (TikTok followers, same key words: motherhood, fashion, lifestyle) and both have a family portrait as their first pinned photo

• Elizabeth posts WIEIADs where she shows herself sipping on coffee with that closed-eye thing Tamara likes to do when she’s drinking her supplements or whatever

• Elizabeth gave a shoutout to single parents and talked about how hard solo parenting is when her husband leaves for business trips (sound familiar? She posted this video about a month before Tamara did)

• they wear identical headbands when they do GRWMs

I’m sure there are some other examples, but you get the idea. 

Am I reaching or does it truly seem like Tamara is copying this woman and probably other influencers… which would explain why she’s not relatable and all over the place with the topics she yaps about — none of her “chats” are her own original thoughts. 

I’ve always gotten the vibe that Tamara would be the type to copy her friends and be jealous or unsupportive unless it benefited her somehow.

I (27F) have gone no contact with my biological mother (52F) for almost 10 years. She recently reached out through a social worker to let me know she’s in end-stage renal failure. Apparently, I’m her only hope.

I said no.

And now the entire extended family, her church friends, and even my former therapist (whom she contacted without permission) are calling me cold, ungrateful, and unforgiving. So here’s some context.

My mom was a nightmare—cold, vicious, narcissistic, screamed if I cried, punished me for sneezing wrong. My dad left when I was 6 and never looked back. It was just me, her, and her string of alcoholic boyfriends. 

When I was 8, I got a little white rabbit for my birthday. I named her Princess Snowflake. She slept in my bed, I brushed her ears every morning, and she was literally the only source of comfort I had. 

My mom didn’t like that I cried a lot. She said I was “melodramatic” and “a little actress.” One time when I was 9 I cried alot because I got shoved and made fun of at school for my shoes and she said, “If you don’t stop crying, I’ll give you a real reason to cry.”

Next day, I came home and Princess Sowflake's cage was open. My mom said she “must’ve ran because I was being too clingy.” I cried so hard I started hiccuping. My mom rolled her eyes and told me to grow up.
That night, she made me a “special dinner.” I remember it so clearly because it was the only time she lit candles. She sat across from me smiling. I asked what the meat was, and she said “just eat.” I was starving. I ate all of it.
Halfway through, she said, “That was Princess Snowflake. Maybe next time don’t cry so much.”
I vomited on the plate. She grabbed me by the hair, shoved a towel into my hands, and said, “Clean it up. Nobody likes a dramatic little b*tch.”

I couldn’t speak for six days. Literally. Not one word. My teacher thought I had developed selective mutism. She even told the school counselor and called my mother. This only made her more angry and she screamed at me when we came back and didn't send me to school until I finally spoke.

Two years later(at 11), I showed up to school with bruises on me. One of her boyfriends shoved me into a coffee table when I accidentally dropped his beer. I said I fell down the stairs. My teacher didn’t believe me. CPS got involved. I was extremely terrified because she had threatened me and told me horror stories about how foster kids are treated way worse, so I completely denied to the social workers that anything wrong happened and that I just fell.
CPS visited a more few times and she baked them pies and cookies and was like a completely different person. They dropped the case soon enough.

Another time , I got lice from school. She shaved my head with kitchen scissors and told me I looked like a “mental patient.” Then she took pictures and posted them to Facebook with the caption, “Bald and Beautiful! LOL.”

At 16, I tried to run away. She lied and reported me as a juvenile delinquent and told the police I was addicted to pills. I was taken to a juvenile psych hold for 72 hours. My file still has a record of it.

I escaped her house at 18, went no contact at 19, and spent the next several years couch-surfing and eating in shelters while I worked my way through community college. I’m now in therapy, stable, and safe.

And now she wants my kidney? 

 I’m being hounded by texts, phone calls, guilt-tripping Facebook posts, and even a local church that’s praying for me to “find forgiveness.”
Even my uncle called sobbing, saying I’m “letting her die in pain.”  My grandmother says “you only get one mother” and “she made a mistake, but this is life or death.”
I said I hope she finds a donor, but it won’t be me. The last time she gave me something, it was rabbit stew made from my best friend.

But now I'm having second thoughts. I mean I don't really want to do this but people have been making me feel like the AH. 

I don’t think people understand what it was like.

Sometimes when she screamed at me—really screamed, like I wasn’t even human—I would just collapse. I couldn’t breathe. I’d cry so hard my chest would seize up and I’d fall to the floor.

She’d call me a parasite. A mistake. She’d say, “You should’ve died before you were born.”

Then she’d step over me like I was dirt.

Honestly… even writing this post made me relive everything. I thought I’d processed it, but typing it out brought it all back like it was yesterday. The screaming. The cold looks. The way I used to cry so hard I couldn’t breathe, and she just walked away.
I can still feel how small I felt.
And now literally everyone is calling me heartless because I won’t give my kidney to the person who made me afraid to exist?
I didn’t write this post for validation—I wrote it because part of me is still that little girl, wondering if I’m wrong for protecting myself. Wondering if I am the selfish one.

Using the CPAP has become seamless and it's even helped me fall asleep faster at night (used to just toss and turn or take Tylenol PM to knock out). Since my first night of CPAP use, I haven't had any coffee or energy drinks and the most I'll have is a diet coke or two on workdays. I used to be very drowsy or tired while at work (before I had to use my standing desk to make sure I didn't doze off) and was averaging at least 2 energy drinks or coffees. Post-workout recovery has been significantly better and my energy levels are so much more than pre-CPAP.

If any of you lowlife fucking titty fuckers try to steal my precious work, I will hunt you down and suck the very soul from the depths of your being!!!

Now, without further ado…

This story is called Leaves of Grass. [Not to be confused with Walt Whitman]

Tom stood on his porch, coffee in hand, watching his lawn with the solemnity of a man with nothing left to lose. The grass had grown exactly one-eighth of an inch since yesterday. With a purposeful stride, he retrieved the mower from the shed. Clouds drifted in an extraordinary beige and blue smear upon the heavens as he trimmed each blade to uniform height. A breeze stirred, but not enough to move anything important. After thirty-seven minutes and eighteen seconds, he finished. He then wiped his brow, replaced the mower, and admired his work. The grass looked precisely as it had before. He stared out the window, pondering what to do next. Considering Tom had no job, and absolutely no goals or ambitions in life, he quickly came to the conclusion that the logical thing to do would be to go back to bed. Therefore, that was the end of Tom’s day. The end.

Now… I know you might be thinking, “what makes Tom so special? Why should we care about Tom?” The short answer is, you shouldn’t. You shouldn’t give a flying fuck about Tom or his lawn. You should give a fuck about me. Because no matter what I write, it’s fucking brilliant. Tom is a vessel. Tom is the empty husk into which I poured my genius. Tom is NOTHING without ME.

All was well until 2 days after surgery I stood had a piercing headache and nausea  but laid down right away since I was still taking heavy narcotics and slept most the day.  Next day got up and go my coffee, drank about 1/2 and piercing headache followed with vomitting.   Went to stand alone ER, ambulance ride to hospital for spinal headache diagnosis.  Bedside blood patch was tried that afternoon with no success.  CT scan in morning and second blood patch with imaging done the next day.  Full 24 hours post patch in hospital and laid flat entire 3 days in hospital unless bathroom or eating.  Discharged with Fiorecet and advice that should be 3-5 days to feel better.

10 days later still getting headaches when upright longer than an hour or two.  Not bad enough to want to stab my eyes with ice pick but still debilitating to do anything but lie down.  Meds take it from a 5-6 pain to 2-3 but never fully disappears.

Did follow up with orthopedic surgeon - hip is perfect but he didn’t have much advice on headaches and has referred me to neuro.

1krj0pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1krj0pw/tips_on_productivity_from_adhder/,Tips on productivity from ADHDer," I'm 32 and I was diagnosed with ADHD about 5 years ago. I’ve spent last years trying to understand better how to survive in this world where everything and everyone wants me to be a productive member of society, and I’d like to share some of my survival tips. I believe they can be useful even for those without ADHD who just want to stop procrastinating, be sharper, and so on. So, here is my list:  
  
1. Meditation to start the day. This is the first thing I do when I wake up. It sounds simple: just breathe and scan your body from head to toe. At first, even five minutes felt impossible. But after a week of steady practice, I noticed how it trained my mind to face difficult things right from the beginning of the day. It became the keystone of my morning routine. I think of it like a cold shower for brain fog.  
  
2. Don’t chase productivity. Now, when I feel like I can’t do anything, I let myself rest, stare at the ceiling, daydream, etc. A 15 minute break helps me more than a cup of coffee ever could and it doesn’t give me a crash.  
  
3. No pron. I used to think it helped me release stress and stay focused. In reality, I was draining my dopamine and ending up more frustrated and distracted than before. I don’t have a regular partner, and when I feel that I really want to masturbate, I do it with mindfulness, not with artificial images.  
  
4. Nature actually became my best friend. I weighed stimulants with their side effects on one hand and psilo microdosing with none of them on the other. It’s been 1 year since I’ve been on and off different microdosing protocols and it’s amazing how my mind stays sharp and clear from some milligrams of mushrooms even weeks after stopping them. (Not an advice or call to action)  
  
5. OM chanting. I’m not religious or spiritual and I think any other calm voice practice can do the trick, but I enjoy the way my body resonates with this sound. I hear myself, follow the vibration, and it gives me more connection with my body, more alertness.  
  
6. Digital detox. Social media garbage distracted me more than I thought and I was kind of an information addict, so I spent my precious dopamine on other people’s lives and then wondered why I was so anxious and tired after an hour of scrolling. Now I limit my social media usage to 40 minutes a day and even have one day on the weekend when I don’t use gadgets at all. It really helped me to be more focused on my own shit and get it done.  
  
I hope my experience can help someone, and if you have more tips to add, please share. Let’s create a manual for this productivity-oriented world.",15,1747782515.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False
1krizwz,https://i.redd.it/qfw1ttvkq02f1.jpeg,The Importance of a Watering Can,"After confirming that it is better to produce flowers and seeds with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 2 levels without combining watering cans, I decided to delete my account and grow it again. The first advantage of this is that you can get more 100 points from the pass synthesis, and you can get more pass points by ordering 3 level 7 flowers faster. Second, you can get much more seed bags than one level 7 watering can, so you can definitely get the maximum reward from hammer events or island events. Third, since you get a lot of flowers, you can also get a lot of bubbles, so it is good for getting energy or rubies.

That's why I deleted my account and am growing it again. When growing my account again, just like the watering can, if you have 4 to 6 coffee machines or ice cream machines from level 2 to the max level, there are many good points such as bubbles and synthesis times. Just do that until you reach the watering can level, and after you get the watering can, you can synthesize the rest because of the space and only use the watering can.

We started talking in November, and by the start of December, we got together. He subtly asked me to be his girlfriend and.. I said yes. I fell in love with him altogether, but the things I loved most were his heart and his personality. We were so sweet in the beginning.. We went on our first date a day after getting together. He bought me coffee, even after I insisted I paid for my own, and then we took a stroll through our then Christmas light decorated city. We even went to a beautiful lake, fooled around like two sweethearts and teased each other, he lifted me up in the air quite a few times, hugged me endlessly, told me he loved me so much.. At the end of the date, we couldn't even let go of each other. We held each other in one of the tightest, longest hugs possible, and oh I felt so warm in that cold December night.. Then came the time where he picked me up with his bike. I loved being his backpack. We would fool around with it too. Lots of laughs, him looking back at me to look into my eyes and smile so sweetly under his balaclava.. Gosh I miss it. We hung out quite often, and every single time, we would sit on a bench and just.. Cuddle and enjoy the moment, he used to tease me once in a while.. Etcetera. I remember going on our second bike date. It was two days before his birthday, and the day before, I happened to be at the mall with my best friend, and so, I stopped to buy him a gift, even though he told me not to get him anything. I bought him a guardian bell for his bike (it's a little bell that is supposed to protect the biker that receives it, and the giver is supposed to put the bell on the bike for it to protect. it's more of an act of love) and a few more things. Back to the second bike date, more and more laughs while riding. It was very fun, not gonna lie. His friend joined us, and we rode to a beautiful cliff that had the view of the whole city. Keep in mind it was still December, and even though it was around 4 pm, the sun started setting. The view was absolutely breathtaking. We both sat on a bench there while his friend and his girlfriend were on another, enjoying the moment, and we didn't speak a word. We were afraid, shy.. But he subtly got closer, and so, I did too, until finally, he pulled me closer and started cuddling me and warming me up. That was the perfect moment to give him the gift. His reaction was the sweetest; I could never forget it.. We stayed there for one more hour, and I almost fell asleep in his arms. He even gave me his jacket as a blanket, I was so comfy in his arms.. I loved it. At the beginning of January, we had our first kiss at that same cliff. We were alone that time, no other riding buddies or stuff. It was the first kiss for both of us, so it was truly beautiful. After that, we couldn't even get enough of it. We kissed once every 5 seconds or so.. But a week after, we had a huge argument, and he threatened to break up with me for good. The truth is, I was constantly anxious of his sudden outbursts and threats with breakups. I was way too attached, and I forgot about myself just to please him. I cried for 10 hours straight that night, but still managed to talk to him for hours straight, but to no avail apparently. He said that he's breaking up, and I suddenly got blinded by all the overwhelming feelings and fear. I picked up a blade. It was so bad I couldn't get up for a while, but with blood still running down my arm, I continued texting him, desperate for another chance. The reason of the argument was a loyalty test I did on him before we got together, because I wanted to know what type of guy he was. I admitted to that without lying, and he took it way too serious.. Anyway, the next morning, I woke up at 6 am without an alarm, and immediately started crying, even though my soul was so tired. I knew he will wake up at 6:20 - he always does, and so, I waited for him to wake up and immediately texted him, asking if he thought about giving me another chance; giving US another chance. After an hour, he agreed. I was so happy.. But at the same time, I regretted harming myself. 2 days later, he came over to talk to me, and the talk ended in quite a few kisses and hugs. We got back together officially. I couldn't have been happier. Few days later, we went out again, and he took me to a more hidden spot with benches and a beautiful view. We cuddled as usual, but things got a bit more heated, and we ended up making out. Whatever. Next, and last time we met up. It was at the near end of January, a cold night, and we went to the same spot, guess why? To kiss, hug, and make out again. But I noticed that even before and now, his hands would only roam over my rear, and less on my waist, face or other. I ignored that, not caring about me whatsoever, but caring only about how he felt in the moment. I let him be happy. At the end of the date, he realized that he was gonna miss his night bus, and he didn't even mention it, just handed me my jacket and literally ran away from me as fast as he could. And I was left alone, in a freezing winter night, needing to walk all the way home. Again, I didn't really care, but I felt a bit.. Weird. He kept spamming my phone with messages, calls, telling me that he's so sorry, etcetera. I forgave him when my hands felt warm enough to be able to text, cause I freezed outside in that cold temperature. It was -10°, something like that. That night, when we talked like usual, I mentioned my self-harm scars again. He had never seen them. The thing is, I had a few, faded SH scars from before I started talking to him, and right after meeting him, I told him about them, and he didn't care about them. But now when I mentioned them, he asked to see them, and I showed him my arm. Yes, the arm with those 2 week old deep cuts. I had to edit the photo to make them look healed and not so.. Deep. But when I showed him a photo, he stayed online without texting at all for at least 5 minutes. I asked him what was wrong, and he said ""I wasn't expecting that"". I tried to talk him out of his confusion, but something just changed in him. He was barely texting. Ever since the moment he saw them, he stopped texting first, stopped seeing my messages almost immediately, like he always used to do, stopped saying ""I love you"", ""Kiss you"" and even ""Good night"", stopped wanting to go out with me, stopped telling me about his day or if he was gonna go out on a ride, like he always used to tell me.. I didn't know what to feel. I even subtly mentioned that I missed our last dates, and when I said ""What about you?"", he said ""Meh"". Again, I didn't think much of it. Then, I decided to test him, and so, I didn't text him for the whole day to see what he would do. Nothing. He didn't text me, but he was active on Instagram and TikTok. I felt like shit. Three days after showing him the scars, I talked to him a bit, then went out in the city with my MTB and headphones to clear my mind a bit. And guess who I see. Him. He didn't tell me he was going out.. Strange. When he saw me, he hesitantly stopped, and because I still considered myself his girlfriend, I approached him to talk casually, try to crack a joke, but I could see it in his eyes that he wasn't the same no more. His gaze was distant, cold, unloving even. And when it was time to leave because his riding buddies arrived, I asked for a kiss, and he said no. I looked at him a bit more and asked again, and then he scoffed and hummed. That was our last kiss. A very hesitant kiss. I bet that if he was already with his riding buddies and he saw me, he wouldn't have stopped, but I think he stopped just to wait for them, and not for me at all. Anyway, we both left and went on our own ways, and after 30 minutes, he calls me to say that I should remove the heart from his name from my phone. I asked why, but he ended the call. I stayed in the city for a bit more, and every time he would pass me, he would look at me at all. He'd loon at other girls though. I just went home and cried, then decided to finally text him and ask him what the hell was going on. He gave me no reason, and he said that he is breaking up with me. I cried so much that night.. And he tried to make me stop crying by telling me that I'm the first and last girl, that he'll always keep that guardian bell on his bike (he in fact didn't, he returned it to me through a friend. I asked for it back because I didn't see it on his bike no more), etc. All lies, cause a week after the breakup, I heard he started talking to other girls. 
Whatever, sorry for explaining detail to detail, but I really don't understand why he TRULY broke up with me. Did he stop loving me, but didn't know how to tell me? Did he find another, and cut me off? Cause I forgot to mention, but almost immediately after he broke up with me, a girl that he tried to hook up in the past followed me. She's his failed situationship, just cause she rejected him. Or did he break up because of my scars? The scars that I have because of him?

i’ll be visiting seattle for the first time with my partner and we’re running into a little bit of an issue where we arrive at 9am but our checkin time isn’t until 3pm

I was hoping to get some help with finding out some relaxing things to do in and around the downtown area (we would rather not stray super far) after our flight.

A couple ideas i had was a bath house/spa that has a day pass system so we can hang around. Perhaps some place to lounge and take a nap. A good coffee shop that has a relaxing atmosphere. Any and all ideas or suggestions that contain limited walking are welcome! Thank you so much!",3,1747781954.0,SeattleWA,2,1.0,False

We've met for kind of a coffee date to see if there was chemistry and overlapping interests - and there definitely were. Due to our schedules, Friday is our first chance to play. 

Today he sends me a text saying, no sex for Friday. His partner is uneasy about it and they are being cautious. Apparently he hasn't been in a dynamic recently and she's feeling a little uneasy about it. She herself has recently started seeing someone else, with no restrictions on sex. They would like some time to talk and even out the expectations between themselves.  So it's not ""no"" forever. 

I'm disappointed that it's a bit last minute, but the bigger question is how long do I give for a grace period? Or is the consensus that at this point, this shouldn't be an issue? ",15,1747781941.0,polyamory,24,0.95,False
