------------------------------------------------------

Creating a welcoming and cozy atmosphere on your patio can transform your outdoor space into a lively gathering spot. One of the best ways to achieve this is by incorporating a propane fire pit. These versatile units not only enhance your outdoor decor but also provide warmth and an inviting ambiance for your family and friends.

Propane fire pits are an excellent option for those who want the benefits of a fire without the hassle of collecting firewood or dealing with ash. They are easy to use and maintain, making them a great choice for any homeowner. Here are several key benefits of using a propane fire pit on your patio.

### Safe and Convenient

Unlike traditional wood-burning fire pits, propane fire pits are designed with safety in mind. They produce a clean and efficient flame, reducing the risk of flying embers that can ignite nearby vegetation or structures. For families with small children or pets, this feature alone can offer peace of mind.

Check Details Here: https://trendzbooster.com/propane-fire-pit-patio  
  
- Easy Ignition - Most propane fire pits come with a simple ignition switch, making them easy to start with just the push of a button.
- Control the Flame - You can easily adjust the flame height with a dial, allowing you to create the perfect mood for your gathering.
- Portable - Many designs are lightweight and can be moved around your patio or even taken to camping trips and family gatherings.

### Effortless Cleanup

One of the biggest advantages of a propane fire pit is the minimal cleanup required. Unlike wood fires, which leave behind ash and debris, propane units only require periodic checks of the propane tank and wiping down the surfaces. You can enjoy your evenings without worrying about post-use maintenance chores.

### Year-Round Use

Propane fire pits extend your outdoor enjoyment throughout the year. Whether it’s a chilly autumn evening or a cool summer night, you can easily gather around the fire with family and friends. They are excellent for warming up your patio during cooler months, making it a year-round entertaining area.

### Environmentally Friendly

Another significant benefit is that propane burns cleaner than wood, producing fewer emissions. This aspect is particularly appealing to eco-conscious homeowners looking to reduce their carbon footprint. If you're interested in keeping your outdoor gatherings as green as possible, a propane fire pit is an ideal choice.

### Variety of Styles

Propane fire pits come in various styles, sizes, and materials to fit any patio decor. Whether you prefer a modern look with sleek lines or a rustic design that mimics a traditional campfire, there's an option available for you.

- Customizable Flames - Add colored glass or lava rocks for a personalized touch to the flame.

### Social Interaction

A propane fire pit serves as a natural gathering point for friends and family. The warmth and flicker of flames create an inviting atmosphere that encourages conversation and connection. Whether you're roasting marshmallows or sharing stories, the experience around a fire is unforgettable.

### Affordable Outdoor Aesthetic

Enhancing your patio’s aesthetic doesn’t have to break the bank. Propane fire pits are available at various price points, making it easier to find a model that fits your budget.

- **Water Features:** Add a small fountain or pond nearby for the soothing sound of water, which complements the crackling of the fire.

- **Fire Extinguisher:** Keep a fire extinguisher or a bucket of sand nearby just in case of an emergency.

A propane fire pit patio is a wonderful way to enhance your outdoor living space. By thoughtfully selecting a location, style, seating arrangements, lighting, and incorporating natural elements, you can create a serene retreat. Keep safety in mind, and soon your patio will be the perfect spot for gatherings, relaxation, and enjoying the clear night sky.

### Conclusion

A propane fire pit on your patio transforms your outdoor space into a cozy haven. The warmth and ambiance it provides create the perfect environment for gatherings, whether it's a quiet evening with a book or a lively get-together with friends.

1hmiapv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hmiapv,"Epic Pass Trip Report (Vail, Beaver Creek, Keystone)","Spent the last few days skiing at Vail, Beaver Creek & Keystone and just wanted to share our experience as first time visitors. Hope this trip report helps other people who are planning a ski trip to Colorado!

**Lodging**
We stayed at an Airbnb in Silverthorne (about 30-40 minutes to Vail, 50 minutes to Beaver Creek, 10 minutes to Keystone). The drive is pretty scenic so it wasn’t too bad doing it everyday, and we saved a lot of money. 

**Parking**
We opted to park at Vail’s Lionshead Garage ($40), and Beaver Creek’s Ford Hall Garage ($50) on two of the days when we carpooled with other people. Then for the other two we went with Red Sandstone Garage ($20) in Vail, and Bear Lot ($13) in Beaver Creek, when it was just the two of us. Generally arrived around 9am and had no issue finding a parking spot, in fact there were still plenty of spaces. For Keystone we parked at River Run which is free. 

**The Villages**
Both Vail and Beaver Creek are modeled after European ski towns so it’s pretty quaint and romantic. They are super bougie, decorated for Christmas. Keystone is much more down to earth.

Vail has two mini towns, the Lionshead one is smaller and main Vail one is bigger (but honestly both are not very big.) Recommend checking them both out, but if you only have time for one the main Vail Village is nicer. 

Beaver Creek village was smaller than Vail but it’s situated within a massive gated “country club”-like area that has multiple bases like Ritz Carleton, Riverfront Resort, and other resort neighborhoods. There are escalators to get around the Beaver Creek village, which is the first I’ve seen at a ski resort. It feels a step more fancy than Vail. There are fire pits everywhere with cushy seating. 

Didn’t spend much time exploring Keystone’s River Run Village since we were just there for a quick ski in the morning before heading to the airport. It involves quite a bit of walking to get from the parking to the gondola, and the parking lot is very icy. 

There isn’t that much to do in the towns, you could probably finish walking around and checking out the shops within 1 hour (Keystone probably 20 mins), then do apres-ski. Food in the villages is expensive, but there are some nice deals to be found! (More on food at the end of the report)

**The Mountains**
We were lucky with sunny bluebird days so the views were gorgeous and the sun helped soften up the snow a bit. We got 2-3 inches of fresh snow one night and the next day was amazing!

Vail had a lot of catwalks. It’s very wide and spread out, there’s a frontside and also several backside bowls. Easy to get lost and it takes quite some time to traverse back and forth to different areas. Overall there’s a good mix of intermediate and advanced terrain. On one of the days we joined a free Mountain Tour which was really fun! They showed us how to get across the mountain and avoid lift lines, and shared the backstory behind several of the trails. We also stopped by Legacy Hut to learn about Vail’s history and send some postcards for free. 

Beaver Creek has the most beautiful views. It is much more beginner friendly - noticed more kids and ski school folks. Lots of chill green runs near the top of the mountian so you can cruise and enjoy the views. McCoy Park was amazing on the powder day… 

Both resorts were generally pretty empty in the early morning but started to get a little crowded around 11am, and then more so later in the afternoon. Even when it got “crowded” we didn’t wait longer than 5-10 minutes at any of the lifts. And most of the runs are very wide anyways. 

Keystone was also very scenic when you get to the top of the mountain. But the snow coverage was worse and more icy here compared to Vail and Beaver Creek. It did not feel too crowded, but we were only there from around 9-11am.

**The Food**
Lots of food options in Vail were Swiss or Austrian or German style food. Also quite a few Italian restaurants. Very high prices, so we did a mix of packing our own lunch and buying food at the resort, and also cooked some meals at the Airbnb. Lunch is around $15-$20 (for a burger or hot dog), dinner in a restaurant is around $50-$75 per person. 

**Food review:**
- The Blu Cow: Swiss hot dogs, kinda pricey for a hot dog ($17) but was tasty
- Vail Brewing Company: We got lucky and snagged seats by the fire pit overlooking the ice rink, so it was a nice spot for apres-ski 
- Almresi Vail: Cozy atmosphere, maybe a little too kitschy but it’s nice for Christmas. Had cheese fondue, schnitzel, pork loin, & rosti. All the food was delicious!
- Mamie’s Mountain Grill: Amazing views and outdoor dining on a sunny day. They serve Pretzel bun hot dogs. Again it was around $15 for a hot dog, but by now we were used to the high prices. 
- Cookie Time at Beaver Creek: At 3pm Beaver Creek gives out free chocolate chip cookies at the base of the mountain. Look for the crowd of people waiting next to Powder 8 Kitchen & Tap. The cookie is just average, but it’s a cool tradition and free food is always nice!
- Aritza: Spanish tapas, live music, and with happy hour 50% cocktails and tapas it was not too expensive. The Hot Toddy was so delicious (it’s hot whiskey with lemon honey and cinnamon). Paella was great too. 
- Blue Moose Pizza: Got a slice of the Vintage pizza which has roasted red peppers and meatball. By far the best tasting “cheap” eat at $6 for a slice. 
- The One Sushi and Ramen (Silverthorne): Sushi rolls pretty good, ramen was average. 
- Red Buffalo Coffee & Tea (Silverthorne): Salmon bagel was really good, as was the coffee. 

We skipped Breckenridge on this trip since it didn’t seem to have great snow coverage yet, and we opted to return to Vail & Beaver Creek instead. Didn’t regret this since it seems like Breckenridge tends to be the most crowded resort. We were still glad to squeeze in Keystone for like 2 hours, it was relatively convenient to check it out on the way out of Silverthorne. We had a bit of extra time and took the scenic route which passed by Arapahoe Basin - it was beautiful!

1hmia4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathspellOmega/comments/1hmia4z/deathspell_omega_and_twin_peaks/,Deathspell Omega and Twin Peaks,"I’ll start by saying that this is a personal take on both DsO and Twin Peaks, in a way intentionally knowing that I am interpreting things “incorrectly”. This might be indefinite and long, so I’ll call it **Part 1**.

This isn’t a link that I have previously thought about (and then writing later after some sort of careful mulling over of things). This is just a flow of ideas as they come to me when I think about DsO and Twin Peaks. My subconscious is trying to piece together things for my conscious so I can think about them, so I guess I’ll write it down.

Here are some immediate thoughts.

The space Black Lodge represents Black metal; or at least the result of just the right circumstances of sound, imagery, the time of day and place you hear it, the movie of your life this is currently playing, or to put it in a way, a certain complete immersion that is triggered as a result of multiple things. You enter the Black Lodge with the right circumstances. Black metal, or Deathspell Omega is not the only path to reach it, but it is one of them. One that I think I had personal experience with. I’ll come to this later, maybe.

It was a few years ago that I watched Twin Peaks, and I had watched it as a kid/teen. I don’t remember it too well; I’ve been blessed with a bad memory for all things media. But I remember: you could watch Twin Peaks as a comfort show, I could. It’s comforting, it’s cozy, at the back of your mind you might wish life to be *something like it.* The murders and the weird vibe don’t seem to mess with this wish. You wouldn’t mind being Bobby, you wouldn’t mind being a Sherriff, you wouldn’t mind existing as even the Log Lady. It’s comforting, and the weirdness of this place (that shows up in places now and then) is not a bug but a feature that fits in well with the comforting half/part of Twin Peaks. It almost makes it more inviting. Maybe the existence of this parallel world of weird makes your experience of being—an FBI agent drinking coffee, chatting up a cute waitress at the counter at Double R Diner—the weird at its best enhances the place and your experience of the normal of this place, at worst, doesn’t detract or mess with it while you experience the normal (unless you’re a teenage girl like Laura about to be destroyed by the weird).

Many people in Twin Peaks might go about their lives not aware about the existence of a weird. Maybe the weird doesn’t demand a big audience, it doesn’t want everyone. But I think it does want to be *seen*. That is where the Black Lodge comes in. The Black Lodge could mean an explicit experience with the weird, the void that is “void” only in its relation to human understanding, but not actually empty; maybe one of the many forms a human encounter could take. The Black Lodge of Twin Peaks could be seen as corresponding to many forms (you can reject some of them based on your personal interpretations): the short but also infinite moments of disconnect and unreality/too-much-reality after a near fatal car crash, the Peak Experience as it meant to Bataille, the brief moment of the subconscious what-the-hell-is-it-that-I’m-doing-really during sex (the moment her body feels too real/unreal and you two are infinitely vulnerable existences pleasuring each other *with no meaning,*  in the encompassing and total invulnerable space of Chaos that loaned you both some time to exist in it, that will later watch you die the way it watches a bird fly—it will be qualitatively the same for it).

Black metal, or particularly DsO, in its right circumstances could be one of the paths to this weird, which is why I write this here. When you dip in and out of DsO with the background of your regular life, it might be comparable to someone who has encountered the Black Lodge dipping in and out of a certain insanity; balancing the experience of comfort/regular life with the experience of encounters of the weird/incorporating of the weird into your being/psyche. Which is why Deathspell Omega is a danger for you if you wish to take action/make plans in the regular experience of your world. It’ll mess with it, you’ll have visible signs on you and people will take notice that a certain insanity has slipped in into you (which it has).

This is why I remember in an interview they said something along the lines of “hearing the album is enough of an experience”, in the context of the lyrical material not being wholly necessary for a certain experience. The sound is enough, in many ways. The sound takes you, with the right circumstances, to a chaos—one that exists in parallel—that wants an audience, wants to be seen *by you.*

I remember the day the Long Defeat was released. This was during the 3^(rd) or so listen that day, it was night, I was in the bathroom with headphones, the lights went off for a while, and I decided to go to the mirror.

>“At its worst, this horror could force your own reflection upon your face”.

I looked at my face and kept staring, I couldn’t help it. There was something interesting about this reflection in the near dark. I stared and stared, and my face was morphing and convulsing into shapes, total darkness instead of eyes. I opened my mouth to show my teeth to this reflection in the dark. The reflection was grinning, I wasn’t.",1,1735192998.0,DeathspellOmega,0,1.0,False

Nearly went and booked a 4-night stay at a nearby Four Points to get me over the hump, but starting to rethink whether it's worth it - would appreciate any input.

My thought process - I get 15 stays towards the minimum from my Chase card and average 40-50 actual nights a year, never eat hotel breakfast but I do usually raid the club lounge for coffee and snacks throughout the day. Occasionally get upgraded when I check in but not often.

I get the 5 Nightly Suite Upgrades as my yearly benefit, have requested to use it probably 30-40 times and have never once had it approved. The one time they did, the front desk said they made a mistake when I went to check-in and stuck me in a regular room.

Based on that I'm thinking it's probably not worth dropping $800 on an empty room to make it back this year. The one thing that is giving me pause is I almost always end up checking out at 4pm. 2pm isn't terrible but definitely won't be as comfortable as having the room until the late afternoon.

I woke up at 5 am with crippling anxiety, still drunk. I woke up my family at around 6 with (likely noticeable) weird energy and we opened presents. I tried so hard to act normal. I drank coffee. I “ooed” and “aahed” at the gifts. But I felt like garbage. 

Eventually I had to go back to bed because I was so hungover. My children, then 3 and 5, were used to this. Once or twice a week I had such a bad hangover that I could barely function. My partner played with the kids outside with their new toys. I missed it all, sleeping and feeling terrible and crying through panic attacks. 

I’m not sure what changed in me that day, two years ago. The hangover was run of the mill, as awful as it was. The night before wasn’t the drunkest I’d ever been. I didn’t do anything egregious or fight with my husband or get a dui. 

I just had enough. I didn’t want to be the hungover mom anymore. I wanted to be a better wife. I wanted to be healthy. So I got. Off. The fucking. Hamster wheel. 

I did it with podcasts. Long walks with my dog.  Copious amounts of bubbly water. This sub. Candy and ice cream. Lexapro. 

Eventually, I went from long walks to short runs. 
Those short runs soon evolved into longer runs. I ran a half marathon my first year sober. I’m now training for a full in the spring. I’m down forty pounds. I am a present, happy, playful, loving mother and wife. I love (love!!) who I see when I look in the mirror again. I’m about to graduate with my undergraduate degree and I am starting law school in the fall. 

I get to wake up everyday and be myself. 
I never want to be the crying, swollen, anxious hungover blob of a human I was two years ago ever again. That version of myself was so sad, and I wish I could go back in time and hug her. 

Merry merry to all of you in this beautiful community. I definitely will not be drinking with you tonight. ",4,1735192835.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

Many of us would rather spend the holidays with our families, but we have to work to provide you your coffee and food. Please be appreciative. Please don't be surprised when you come to a dunkin on a massive corporate holiday when we're absolutely packed and proceed to yell at us when your order isn't out for 15-20 minutes. We're not animals, and we're not your slaves. Have some compassion for the people serving you on the holidays.

1hmi7a3,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1hmi7a3/my_mom_got_one_over_on_me_for_christmas/,My mom got one over on me for Christmas,"I’m laughing about it because there’s not much else to do. My husband is more annoyed. It’s just so stupid but shows her character so clearly. 

So, my mother and I have been NC for years and then LC now that grandma has late stage dementia. Mother and I have been splitting caregiving duties so I speak to her solely about grandma and that’s it. 

For Christmas, my grandma needed help shopping since she can’t drive and didn’t know what to get people. Now, I could have led grandma astray in searching for my mom’s gift but I didn’t. Why? Cause I’m not an asshole. I saw a pair of joggers in my mom’s size and favorite brand. I recommended to my grandma that she choose that. She got her that and a thick blanket I pointed out since my mom has no warm blankets- just thin, cheap ones. 

Grandma didn’t want me knowing what she was gonna get me for Christmas. She did ask me to give her a list of suggestions and heavily implied she’d get me the Dyson hair dryer I have been wanting forever. She usually gets me several gifts since we’re really close so that would be one of them. My mother, all December, would not take grandma out to Christmas shop for me. She refused to. My grandma was getting distressed, unsure what to do. I told her I would drive her and it would be okay if it wasn’t a surprise. My grandma didn’t want that though and kept pressing my mother to take her shopping for me. 

Well, Christmas morning, my mother finally relented and took her shopping before I picked her up for Christmas brunch with my in laws. She’s close with them and is friends with MIL since they used to attend the same church so they’re always happy to have her over for their holiday celebrations. 

When we were opening gifts there, my grandma gave me a rectangular box that honestly, I was hoping would be that hair dryer since I desperately need one. I’m a POC and have super thick, long, and relatively curly hair. Even washing my hair at night, it’s still damp in the morning when I wake up and I hate that. When I opened it, I saw it was a shampoo and conditioner set. 

I thanked my grandma for it and hid my disappointment. She said my mother had helped her with choosing gifts for me and said I would like them. I said they will come in handy. 

This set wasn’t anything fancy. It was like an $8 set you’d buy from Walmart. I don’t care about the monetary price of gifts and I’m not out spending $50 on hair products, but I get hair care products that work with my hair and scalp type. This particular brand I don’t use because it dries my hair out and certain formulas from this brand (though not this particular one) have actually caused hives to break out on my scalp and neck. 

The next gift, my grandma said my mother specifically chose for us (my husband and I). I stopped before opening it and so did my husband, asking if my mom had bought this directly. Honestly, if she had, we wouldn’t have accepted it but grandma said no, she bought it but my mother said that I would absolutely want and love it. 

We open it up and it’s one of those kids toys that you buy for your worst enemy. It’s a very loud, singing and dancing dog with working maracas. It’s one who will sing Feliz Navidad on repeat several times and you cannot stop it once it starts and it also wears a sombrero with bells attached so those jingle too. 

To put it lightly, it’s pretty annoying. 

My grandma looks at me with a big smile on her face and says that she hopes I like it. That my mother saw it and told my grandma to buy it for me because it “would drive [me]  crazy”

My grandma- who can’t even remember what she said five minutes ago most of the time- thought that it meant drive you crazy with excitement. Again, she has dementia and gets very confused.  It’s very clear though that mom was trying to get me the worst gifts through my grandma. That she was being spiteful. 

Everyone- husband and in laws- who were there saw it and had the same revelation. They know about my mother and her character. Husband and I both thanked grandma for it and told her we love it but privately discussed it. Our 18 month old was loving the toy, dancing along to it like he was shaking maracas of his own, so we decided to just give it to him at home rather than chuck it in the trash. Maybe it’s me being spiteful but I’d rather not give her this win. I’ll take what she meant to hurt me with and turn it into something fun and good for my baby. 

What’s wild though is that the gift discrepancy is so clear. My grandma got gifts for my MIL and FIL too that my mom helped pick out. They were decent gifts. She got her fancy chocolates and something coffee related. I didn’t quite get a look at it but I heard MIL get happy and say that’s perfect since FIL and her love coffee.

At home, with grandma back at her place (my mom is living with her rent free) and the kids asleep, I just started laughing. Husband and I were getting into the shower when I said that it’s not funny but it kinda is. Husband does not agree with me- he just hates my mother even more. He finds no humor in it. 

It really is not funny when you think about it. It’s just so ridiculous. So petty and spiteful and childish. This is an almost 50 year old woman who is acting like a child. I can just imagine her at home, smug as fuck, thinking she got one over on me. Like… who cares, dude? I am happy in my life. I have kids I love and a husband who loves and respects me. I just finished my bachelors degree and enjoyed the holiday with family who loves me. Whereas my mother spent her holiday alone cause none of her children like her and she has no one. 

So whatever man. I’m gonna laugh about this because it’s not even hurtful. I’m not giving her that. ",2,1735192689.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

The silent reflux every single night, and regurgitating after I eat, I could deal with. Mind you, I literally only ever eat bland foods. Like eating peanut butter and honey is bold for me.

I always knew Issac had a crush on me and we hooked up a couple times but I was never interested, he wasn’t mature enough. His dad (Derek male 62) was ex military and BUILT. He was so strong and took me and Issac fishing a couple times and omg was he something to admire. Senior year issac was on the varsity soccer team and his practice ran late so I went to his to wait for him. His dad was home and we just sat and talked for an hour until Issac got back. For the first time I was able to relate to a man, he was just so mature and carried himself with so much respect. This happened multiple times senior year and in April of 2018 he finally made a move. He made me coffee and we went to the couch, he went down on me and just when his girth was in my mouth we heard Issac’s car. We didn’t speak of it but we were definitely vibing.

While the first 3/4 of the cup tastes great, I’ve noticed that the last quarter always tastes unpleasant—sometimes bitter, sometimes astringent. This happens even when the initial flavour of the cup is perfect.

Some info : -I use a 1:15 ratio

-The beans are freshly ground using my DF54 grinder)

-I brew with a Switch

-This happens across different beans (arabica, robusta, excelsa) and roasts, so I don’t think it’s specific to one type.

I don’t think it’s a grind size or extraction issue, I suspect it has to do with coffee cooling(?)or possibly the concentration of some compounds in the last few sips, but I’d love to hear your thoughts. What could be causing this and how do you prevent it?

**Example**:

Green coffee weighs 200g / Roasted coffee weighs 170g

In the end, I paid the bill and told him that he could get the next one, he agreed. We hugged goodbye and I left. I sent him a message afterwards saying that I really enjoyed seeing him, and talked for a bit as well. 

Today was a hard day for me emotionally. I really noticed by brother’s absence, as did my parents. I wrote my ex and I told him that, I also told him that I didn’t understand why I needed to talk to him.

He didn’t pay attention to the middle-aged woman. Instead, he turned his gaze to the stunning woman who was sitting against the wall in silence, not saying a word.

I felt a heaviness in my left side and tingliness down my arms and legs. I went to the ER in Italy and they were super dismissive I legit thought I was going to have a heart attack.

I got back to the states and had appt right away with my primary care doctor and they did a full blood work panel and it turns out I was severely dehydrated and had an acute kidney injury. I gave up drinking alcohol and coffee for 8 weeks and I started drinking LMNT electrolyte powder. Long story short, it got my kidney levels right back up where they need to be. I had a follow up appt and he said my kidney levels are fine but I kept mentioning to him that ever since that happened I still get heart palpitations and now I get anxiety because of it. I feel like there is an imbalance going on but he kind of wrote me as anxiety and to see a therapist and practice mindfulness and nothing else. Whenever he took my EKG and blood pressure everything came back fine but I know deep down there is something else. I am reaching here to see if there is anything that has helped you all get your heart rate back to a normal pace or has even helped your anxiety naturally? I am so desperate to feel like myself again…it’s been a rough 3 months. For reference, I do exercise and I finally am getting back to my running and the gym since this all happened in September. 

I see people in here talking about magnesium, potassium, taurine, probiotics, fish oil. etc. I just feel overwhelmed and don’t even know where to start. I really don’t want to get on an SSRI as I have been on one before and it did what it needed to do years ago but I don’t think that is the issue here.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, yet many people are unsure about how much they should drink each day. The amount of water you need can vary significantly based on a variety of factors such as age, activity level, climate, and overall health. Exploring the science behind how much water to drink in a day reveals fascinating insights that can help you stay properly hydrated.

First, let’s consider the conventional wisdom you may have heard: the ""8x8"" rule, which suggests drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. This equals about 2 liters, or half a gallon. While this guideline is easy to remember, it isn’t necessarily optimal for everyone. Research shows that individual hydration needs can vary dramatically.

### The Role of Individual Factors

Your specific hydration needs are influenced by several key factors:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Body Weight:** Heavier individuals usually have higher water needs. A common recommendation is to drink half your body weight in ounces. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, aim for about 75 ounces of water daily.
- **Activity Level:** If you exercise, you'll lose fluids through sweat. The more active you are, the more water you should consume to compensate for fluid loss.
- **Climate:** Hot or humid weather can increase your need for water as your body sweats more. If you live in such an environment, you might need to drink more to stay hydrated.
- **Age:** Young children and older adults may have different hydration requirements. Children often need more water relative to their body size due to their higher metabolic rates.
- **Health Conditions:** Certain health conditions, like fever or urinary infections, can alter your hydration needs. If you’re ill, it’s crucial to increase your fluid intake.

### Signs of Dehydration

Understanding your body’s signals can help you determine if you are drinking enough water. Here are some common signs of dehydration:

- **Thirst:** Thirst is the body’s initial warning signal. If you feel thirsty, it’s time to drink some water.
- **Dark Urine:** Well-hydrated individuals typically have light yellow urine. Dark urine is often a sign that you need more fluids.
- **Dry Skin:** Skin that lacks moisture may be a sign of dehydration. Check for elasticity by pinching your skin; it should bounce back quickly.
- **Fatigue:** If you feel unusually tired, dehydration might be the culprit. Even mild dehydration can lead to increased fatigue.

### The Benefits of Staying Hydrated

Staying hydrated has numerous benefits for your body and mind:

- **Improved Physical Performance:** Adequate hydration helps enhance endurance and strength, especially during workouts.
- **Better Brain Function:** Staying hydrated can improve focus, memory, and overall cognitive function.
- **Aids Digestion:** Water is key for proper digestion and helps prevent issues like constipation.
- **Skin Health:** Well-hydrated skin often appears healthier and more radiant.

### Methods to Increase Water Intake

If you find it challenging to drink enough water, here are some simple strategies that can help:

- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keep a refillable water bottle with you at all times to remind yourself to drink throughout the day.
- **Set Reminders:** Use your phone to set hourly reminders to take a sip.
- **Add Flavor:** Enhance your water with sliced fruits, herbs, or cucumber for a refreshing taste.
- **Eat Your Water:** Incorporate water-rich foods into your diet, such as cucumbers, tomatoes, and watermelon.

In essence, exploring the science behind how much water to drink in a day is not just about numbers; it's about understanding your body’s unique needs. By paying attention to signals and considering personal lifestyle factors, you can ensure you stay hydrated for optimal health.

The Importance of Hydration for Overall Health
----------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, and understanding its role in our health is crucial for maintaining well-being. Every cell in your body depends on water to function correctly. But have you ever wondered just how important hydration is for overall health? The answer lies in understanding both the science and the benefits behind proper hydration.

### Why You Need Water

Water makes up about 60% of your body weight. This vital liquid is a key player in various bodily functions:

- **Regulates Body Temperature:** Water helps maintain a steady body temperature. Through perspiration and respiratory moisture loss, water keeps your body cool.
- **Supports Digestion:** Drinking enough water aids in digestion. It helps dissolve nutrients, making them easier for your body to absorb.
- **Lubricates Joints:** Your joints require a proper amount of water to stay lubricated, which reduces friction and helps you move easily.
- **Detoxification:** Water plays a critical role in flushing out toxins from your body, helping your kidneys filter waste effectively.
- **Boosts Energy Levels:** Adequate hydration helps you feel more energetic. Dehydration can lead to fatigue and low energy.

### How Much Water Do You Really Need?

The classic advice is to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day, known as the ""8x8 rule."" However, individual needs can vary based on factors such as body weight, activity level, and climate. Here’s a simple breakdown to determine your personal hydration needs:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **General Guideline:** Aim for half your body weight in ounces. For instance, if you weigh 150 pounds, target around 75 ounces of water each day.
- **Active Lifestyle:** If you exercise regularly, increase your intake. Every hour of intense activity could require an additional 12 ounces or more.
- **Climate Consideration:** Hot or humid weather may necessitate additional hydration due to increased perspiration.

### Signs You May Be Dehydrated

It can sometimes be difficult to gauge how much water you genuinely need. Pay attention to these signs of dehydration:

- **Thirst:** Feeling thirsty is your body’s immediate way of telling you it needs water.
- **Dark Urine:** Dark yellow urine can indicate dehydration. Ideally, it should be a light yellow color.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired or sluggish can often be linked to low water intake.
- **Dry Skin:** Skin elasticity and moisture may diminish due to a lack of hydration.

### Hydration Tips

More water into your daily routine doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Here are some simple and effective strategies:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Keep a reusable water bottle with you to sip throughout the day.
- **Set Reminders:** Use phone alarms or apps to remind you to drink water regularly.
- **Flavor Your Water:** Add slices of fruits, herbs, or vegetables to infuse flavor without added sugars.
- **Eat Water-Rich Foods:** Incorporate fruits and vegetables with high water content, like cucumbers, oranges, and watermelon.

### The Bottom Line

Staying hydrated is not just about drinking water; it's about maintaining a balance that supports your overall health. By understanding your body's hydration needs and following simple guidelines, you can enhance your vitality and improve your well-being. Remember, hydration is key to living an energetic and fulfilling life.

Make a habit of listening to your body, and nourish it with proper hydration. Your body will thank you with better function, increased energy, and overall improved health.

How Activity Level Affects Your Daily Water Needs
-------------------------------------------------

When considering how much water to drink each day, one important factor is your activity level. The amount of water you need can change based on how much you move and sweat. It’s essential to understand that hydration needs aren’t one-size-fits-all. Let's explore how your daily physical activity influences your water requirements.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Our bodies lose water through various processes, including sweating, breathing, and digestion. When you engage in physical activities, especially intense workouts or sports, your body loses even more water through sweat. This is why active individuals need to pay careful attention to their hydration levels.

### How Your Activity Level Impacts Water Needs

Your daily activities fall into different categories, which affect how much water you should drink:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Sedentary Lifestyle:** If you sit most of the day, your water needs are lower. For men, the recommended intake is about 3.7 liters (125 ounces) per day, while women should aim for around 2.7 liters (91 ounces). This includes all fluids consumed throughout the day.
- **Moderate Activity:** If you engage in light exercise or are on your feet for several hours a day, you may need an additional 1-2 liters of water. Regular movement helps maintain hydration, so staying aware of your water intake is crucial.
- **Intense Exercise:** If you’re running, cycling, or participating in sports for more than an hour daily, your water requirements can significantly increase. Aim to drink extra water before, during, and after your workout. Depending on your sweat rate, you might need an additional 1-3 liters or more per day.

To determine how much water you need, consider not only your activity level but also other factors like climate, altitude, and health conditions. For instance, if you are exercising in a hot climate, you may sweat more and require additional hydration to stay balanced.

### Listening to Your Body’s Signals

Your body will often give clues about its hydration needs. Pay attention to:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Thirst:** Feeling thirsty is a direct signal your body sends to indicate the need for water.
- **Urine Color:** A light yellow color generally shows good hydration, while dark yellow or amber can indicate a need for more fluids.
- **Fatigue and Dizziness:** These can be signs of dehydration, especially during physical activities.

### Maximizing Hydration During Activity

Here are some practical tips to ensure you stay properly hydrated, especially during exercise:

- **Drink Water Before Exercise:** Aim to drink at least 500ml (17 ounces) of water about two hours before you start working out.
- **Hydrate During Workouts:** For workouts longer than an hour, consider sipping water or a sports drink every 15-20 minutes.
- **Replenish After Exercise:** Post-exercise, drink a mix of water and electrolyte-rich beverages to balance fluids lost during sweating.

It’s essential to customize your hydration plan based on your personal needs. Keep a water bottle handy throughout the day to encourage regular sipping.

### The Role of Temperature and Humidity

Remember that external conditions also impact your hydration needs. In hot and humid weather, your body may sweat more. On cooler days, you may not feel as thirsty but still need to maintain water intake. Adjust your hydration strategy accordingly based on the environment.

Your activity level plays a significant role in determining how much water you should drink daily. By understanding the connection between physical activity and hydration, you can stay energized, focused, and healthy. Always listen to your body and adjust your fluid intake based on your unique needs. Staying well-hydrated ensures that you perform your best, whether during a workout or your everyday activities.

Common Myths About Water Intake You Should Know
-----------------------------------------------

Water is vital for our health, but confusion remains about how much we should drink daily. Myths often cloud the understanding of proper hydration. Let's explore some common misconceptions about water intake and the reality behind them.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### The ""8 Glasses a Day"" Rule

One of the most famous myths is that you should drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day. While this guideline is easy to remember, it does not apply to everyone. Your hydration needs vary based on factors like:

- Your age
- Your weight
- Your activity level
- Climate and weather conditions
- Your overall health

For some people, drinking less or more than eight glasses can be adequate. It’s best to listen to your body and drink when you feel thirsty.

### All Fluids Count as Water

Another common myth suggests that all fluids contribute equally to your water intake. While it's true that beverages like tea, coffee, and juice keep you hydrated, they often contain calories, sugar, or caffeine. Caffeine may act as a mild diuretic but does not necessarily lead to dehydration in moderate amounts. However, they are not substitutes for water. Water is calorie-free, and drinking it helps weight management without added ingredients.

### You Can Drink Too Much Water

Water intoxication is a possible but rare condition resulting from consuming excessive amounts of water in a short time. It dilutes sodium in your body, leading to a dangerous imbalance. For most people, it's hard to reach that point through regular drinking habits. However, if you're exercising intensely or have health concerns, consult a doctor about your hydration guidelines. It's always smart to stay within reasonable limits.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### You Should Only Drink Water When You're Thirsty

Relying solely on thirst signals for hydration can be misleading. Thirst is often a sign that your body needs water, but it may not always be reliable, especially for seniors or those who are active. Instead, consider drinking water regularly throughout the day, even when you're not thirsty. Keeping a water bottle handy can help remind you to stay hydrated.

### Hydration Comes Only from Bottled Water

Many people assume that hydration can only come from bottled water. In reality, a variety of sources can contribute to your daily water intake, including:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Tap water
- Flavored waters
- Fruits and vegetables like cucumbers and watermelons
- Soups and broths

These foods and drinks contribute significantly to your hydration levels. Eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and veggies should complement your water intake.

### Warm Weather Means You Need More Water

While it’s true that hot temperatures can increase your fluid needs due to sweating, it's not just the weather that influences water consumption. Factors like physical activity play an essential role. If you're exercising or engaging in strenuous activities, you might need more water regardless of the temperature outside. Monitor your sweat and ensure you’re replenishing accordingly.

### Drinking Water Can Help Lose Weight

Staying adequately hydrated can support weight management by suppressing appetite and boosting metabolism. However, it’s not a magic bullet for weight loss. Instead of solely relying on water consumption, combine it with a balanced diet and regular exercise for effective results.

#### Tips for Staying Hydrated

Here are some simple tips to keep you hydrated throughout the day:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- Carry a reusable water bottle with you.
- Set reminders to drink water at regular intervals.
- Incorporate more water-rich foods into your meals.
- Flavor your water with fruits for added taste.

Understanding the truth about your hydration needs can make a significant difference in how you feel daily. Instead of focusing solely on rigid myths, consider your body’s unique requirements. Aim to customize your water intake based on your lifestyle, and prioritize a healthy balance to maintain optimal health.

I grew up in a third-world country in Southeast Asia, where the monthly salary is very low, and the dream of owning a house would take at least 60 years to fulfill. My brother, who works in Japan, offered to fund my studies abroad, and I accepted. I moved to Australia with the hope of building a better future.

Before arriving, I thought finding a job would be easy and that life would be effortless. But things didn’t turn out the way I had imagined. For two months, I couldn’t find a job. I was rejected everywhere I applied, and some places didn’t even reply. Eventually, my sister-in-law helped me get a job through someone she knew in hiring. I worked hard and did really well at that job, but it wasn’t something I wanted to do—it was just a means to pay rent and buy food. Every day felt unfulfilling.

I have a passion for making coffee, and I wanted to work as a barista in a café. After a year and a half, with encouragement from others, I finally applied for a barista job and was hired. I was so happy. I decided to quit my previous job to pursue this. I knew I was new to the role, so I tried my best every day. I woke up early at 4 a.m., commuted an hour and a half each way, learning all I need to learn, did everything I could to help customers.

But despite my efforts, I was bullied by the manager. She shouted at me in front of customers, micromanaged everything I did, and nagged me for things everyone else in the store also did. After two months of enduring this, I was fired. The experience left my mental health in a terrible state, and now I’m struggling to pay rent and buy food with what little money I have left.

When I told my family about what happened, they said it was my fault for leaving my previous job. My mother blamed me, and my brother questioned why I didn’t consult him before making the change. I feel guilty, but at the same time, I can’t accept being blamed for something beyond my control. How could I have known I would be bullied at the new job?

Now I’m back to square one, unable to find a job. I feel overwhelmed with guilt and regret. Was it really my fault? I know I owe my brother a lot, and I’m grateful for everything he has done for me. But I can’t help but wonder—what is the meaning of life if pursuing what I truly want is seen as wrong?",1,1735190708.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

I'm NBSB din pala pero siya nagkaroon na ng two girlfriends, no issue sa akin. I really need advice sa love and situationship na meron ako.

We're both 4th year engineering student. First week ng October ko lang siya napansin kahit na 2nd year palang pala classmate ko na siya. Siya na rin nag first move sa chat dahil sa asaran ng friends pero hindi ko nireplyan, noong hindi ko nireplyan nagchat ulit kaya nagreply na ako kase need talaga replyan yung message niya and ayon nga nagtuloy-tuloy hanggang ngayon. Last November 9, sa 22 years kong existence sa mundo first time kong nag agree ako na makipag meet-up for a coffee. Nagkaroon ako ng chance na makilala siya tapos he's too good to be true or sadiyang first time ko pa lang makipagkilala kaya ganun yung tingin ko sa kaniya. He's a well-spoken man, neat and clean din tignan tapos 15 minutes before kami umalis, he confessed right infront of me na gusto niya ako. I don't know what to reply sa kaniya kase it's my first time. All my life ako naghahabol sa mga crush ko dati hindi pa na-crushback tapos ngayon wow haba ng hair ko girl. And ayon nga, since I like him konti, sabi ko crush ko siya konti lang and nagtanong siya if I want to be his girl. Like bro??? napailing ako, hindi ako sumagot and I told him na my parents is strict nga. So ina-assume niya parang situationship lang ang meron kami.  I don't have negative comments about him kase good pa rin naman treatment niya siya sa akin. 

The problem is I'm someone na bad when it comes to communicating with other people. Naging distant na rin ako noong nag 20's na rin me. Hindi ako tumatagal sa pakikipag-usap sa ibang tao nang matagal sa chat or online. Kaya there's intances na narereplyan ko na siya after a day or two at meron pa yung tumagal ng almost two weeks (semestral break, kaya hindi awkward sa school). Last December, nagstart na second sem, I saw him. Nag aya mag ice cream after class para makapag-usap, in-explain ko side ko why i didn't reply ganun and he understands naman daw. Nag wait lang daw siya saken. I told him na madi-drain siya saken kung ganun kung i-continue pa namin kase idk ganun ako now, I tend to isolate kase kapag hind okay. Hindi ko alam if na-misinterpret niya and he even suggested na kung hindi online mag personal na lang kami and I find it really unfair talaga sa part niya if ganun lang set-up namin. I want to end na yung meron kami na two months of interaction pa lang without constant communication pa but I don't know how.

I have some issues pa sa family ko super strict, we're a family na nbsb/ngsb, na dapat study first muna, pumasa muna sa board exam and all which is gusto ko rin naman muna, I want to be stable sa life bago mag commit sa first and last ko. I know, ako yung red flag here, need ko po ng advice pano ko 'to i-end na mild yung effect sa part niya. 

P.S. Nagaaya siya ulit makipagkita this week.

I’m looking for open mic spots where I can practice and improve on my playing, singing etc. I play mostly indie folk music.

If you know of any open mic nights—at coffee shops, bars, or anywhere else—I’d love to hear about them. I’m hoping to get out there more in 2025 and keep growing.

This perfume is a unique spin-off of the original Khamrah, offering a sophisticated blend of coffee, vanilla, and spices that captures the essence of Middle Eastern luxury. Whether you’re exploring new fragrances or just looking for a signature scent, **Lattafa** **Khamrah Qahwa** has quickly become a favorite for many fragrance lovers. But what makes it so special? Let’s dive into the details.

# What is Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa and Why is It Famous?

**Khamrah Qahwa** by **Lattafa** is a unique fragrance that builds on the original **Khamrah** scent but takes it in a different direction. While the original was inspired by [**Angel’s Share** by Kilian](https://www.bykilian.com/product/19797/82905/perfume/angels-share/the-liquors#/sku/125687), **Khamrah Qahwa** adds a rich **coffee** note (Qahwa), blending it with subtle touches of vanilla and tonka bean. This results in a warm, inviting fragrance that’s less sweet and more balanced, making it perfect for daytime wear.

* **Flanker of**: Khamrah by Lattafa
* **Key notes**: Coffee (Qahwa), vanilla, tonka bean
* **Fragrance profile**: Warm, rich, and inviting without being too sweet
* **Ideal for**: Daytime wear, those who prefer less sweetness

# What Does Khamrah Qahwa Smell Like?

**Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa** is a **spicy gourmand** fragrance that takes you on a sensory journey to a cozy café in the Middle East. It opens with a warm, spicy blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, and bergamot, leading into a rich heart of dates, pralines, tuberose, and mahonial. The base notes of vanilla, tonka beans, benzoin, myrrh, amber wood, and Akigala wood create a smooth, creamy finish with a touch of woodiness.

1hmhky3,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1hmhky3/just_what_im_feeling/,Just what I'm feeling. ,"Here I am, sitting with a fresh cup of coffee. There’s so much waiting to be done, but I don’t feel like moving. 

The cold air clings to the world, I feel the cold but it's a distant feeling. I'm looking up at the morning sky and I’m staring at it, lost in thoughts that aren’t really there. I’m feeling things I can’t name. This heavy, aching sadness that somehow fills me completely. And right now, in this fleeting moment, it feels like enough. Complete. As though this pain, this loneliness, could stretch out forever and I wouldn’t mind.

But this sadness, paired with that selfish, stupid wish, turns into something sharper, as if this strange and fleeting feeling of content is a wrong to be righted. The sorrow of knowing it won’t last. Even before I take my first sip of coffee, the moment will be gone that I know in my bones a type of knowledge that transcends thoughts and reason, shattered in the time it takes to lift the cup. And so here I sit, frozen, clinging to it for one breath longer, hoping against hope to keep it.

Yet I know the truth, it’s already slipping away. And when it breaks, it will break me too. Having it, losing it, shatters me in equal measure. But for now, for this one fragile instant, I hold it close, letting it consume me. And so I wait.

I know paper is made using chemicals like binders, bleach or other stuff to make it look clean and white. Even if the amount of chemicals that could get into the coffee is super tiny, I drink a lot of coffee, so wouldn’t it add up over time?

Here’s what I’ve found so far:

1. **Bleached vs. Unbleached Filters**
   * White filters are usually bleached with chlorine or peroxide. Peroxide is supposed to leave less behind.
   * Brown filters (unbleached) might have fewer chemicals but can add a slight taste to your coffee.
2. **Reusable Options**
   * Metal or cloth filters don’t use chemicals at all, but they change the taste and texture of coffee a bit.

Paper filters are food-safe, but I wonder if the standards assume people don’t use them every day, multiple times like I do.

So, I’m asking:

* Has anyone else worried about this?
* Do you prefer unbleached or reusable filters, and what’s your experience with them?
* Are there any brands you’d recommend that are more natural or safe?",0,1735190237.0,pourover,7,0.33,False
1hmhkf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/friendship/comments/1hmhkf9/when_a_friendship_doesnt_feel_like_a_friendship/,When a friendship doesn’t feel like a friendship anymore,"A few years ago, a girl who was in a relationship started writing to me. She told me outright that she liked me, and we got closer over time, talking for hours every day. I never made a move because she was still with her boyfriend, even though she constantly complained about him.  

At first, I tried to play along and stay friendly, but her constant attention and emotional involvement started to frustrate me. I couldn’t just be her friend anymore—especially not with all the provocations, closeness, and the weird dynamics that felt more like a relationship than a friendship.  

Eventually, we started arguing, having petty fights, and acting like a dysfunctional couple. I knew I had to step back for my own sanity, and I did. She noticed and complained, but I stayed firm. After that, she’d reach out sporadically—every few weeks or months—with a text to reignite the connection.  

The last time she contacted me, it was for a bureaucratic question, and then she casually added, *“Let’s grab a coffee. I’m doing great and feel like I can support you.”* That tone got under my skin. It felt condescending, as if she thought she was being kind to me when she was the one who created all the tension in the past.  

I replied vaguely with, *“Sure, maybe next week or over the weekend,”* but when she started listing her availability and mentioning an upcoming trip, I just didn’t care to ask for details. It’s her usual trick to bait me into asking questions about her life or showing interest, but I wasn’t going to fall for it this time.  

Why should I? I’m not part of her life. I’m not her boyfriend. I don’t even want to know who she’s going on vacation with. After that brief exchange, I didn’t follow up on the coffee plans, even though the dates I suggested would’ve worked. She hasn’t reached out since, and honestly, I’m relieved.  

This whole situation just confirmed what I’ve been feeling for a while: this “friendship” wasn’t healthy for me. It was one-sided and exhausting, and I don’t regret stepping away. Sometimes, the best thing you can do is prioritize your own peace of mind over trying to maintain something that no longer serves you.

TL;DR: A girl I used to be close with invited me for a coffee after a long period of silence, but her tone and behavior reminded me why I decided to step back from our so-called “friendship” in the first place.   ",1,1735190210.0,friendship,0,1.0,False

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/uooiesZxcS): **November 13, 2024**

Throwaway account . I appreciate if you give me your honest opinion as I’m being pressured from everyone (except my aunt) to go against my wish .

I’m a 30 year old woman. I have been with my fiancé Sarah for the last 5 years. We are the same age and we met at grad school. When I was 13 my loving dad passed away. He left a decent amount of money for us . My mom within 6 months got engaged to a guy named Bob. Bob had a daughter around my age . 

My mom married Bob within a year of my dad’s passing . Bob really hated me from the start and didn’t even try to hide it. He was saying stuff like how my mom should have sent me to a boarding school , how if it wasn’t because of my dad’s inheritance he wouldn’t have me in his house , or I’m a “bulldyke” because I was in our school sport team and very athletic . He multiple times told my mom he doesn’t feel safe when his daughter is around me . I wasn’t even yet ! Used this as a reason to exclude me pretty much from everything . 

My mom on the other hand was going above and beyond to prove to Bob that she is the new mom for Bob’s little princess . They ended up having 3 more kids. Basically I was a roommate who did babysitting for my mom and her New family . I never had a birthday party or a special day . 

My dad’s sister was amazing to me . I was at their place all the time . She and her family had birthday celebrations for me and my mom was making excuses not show up and of course rest of them never showed up ( I was really my aunt and uncle’s daughter! They were amazing to me ). When I left for university I contacted my mom a few times but she was always busy so I just gave up. 

Here is the issue , Sarah , my fiancé come from a very family oriented background. Family is everything to her. Her family asked about mine I said my dad passed away and my mom is busy with her family and lives across the country . I didn’t entirely lie technically. Sarah asked me to invite my family to our wedding . I told her no. She said it’s very embarrassing not having only my aunt and her family on my side . I reluctantly invited my mom. She called and asked me to apologize to Bob and my step and half siblings for not inviting them and invite them all. I told her no ! She said I’m being ungrateful and Bob was a father figure to me. I had a big argument with my mom over this . 

My mom now says the only way she comes is if I invite Bob , his daughter and their kids. Sarah is now pushing me to invite them all because she doesn’t wanna feel embarrassed in front of her family . These people never even gave me card or said happy birthday to me so I see no reason to celebrate my big day with them. I on the other hand don’t wanna let my fiancé down. I just don’t know what to do ? Should I swallow my ego and invite my family so my fiancé be happy ? I suggested eloping but Sarah is a firm no. AITAH to ruining my fiancé’s day by not fulfilling her wish ?

Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/JQof2G2zSa

Edit: Sarah knows everything about my life. My aunt even talked to her about how they treated me when I was growing up.

Edit 2: I will have a serious talk with Sarah tonight . I’ll try to update soon

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP received the majority of NTAs**

**Relevant Comments**

**Did OOP want to have a wedding with Sarah?**

> **OOP:** Tbh my dream wedding would be elopement. Sarah has this dream wedding in her mind , and I don’t want to ruin it for her. She wants a big beautiful wedding with families surrounding us. I feel ashamed my family is so messed up and embarrassing her. I feel so inadequate like I’m letting her down. The whole wedding planning has been so stressful and i understand it affected her mental health. No ! Before getting engaged we had a very nice relaxing lifestyle .to be fair before getting engaged she never cared if my mom is in the picture or how her family feel if they see how messed up my family is

**Commenter 1:** Are you sure Sarah is the person for you? She seems pretty dismissive of your boundaries and feelings

> **OOP:** She was 100% before we got engaged… the whole idea of dream wedding completely changed her

**OOP should postpose the wedding and get in therapy**

> **OOP:** My aunt one time said that then changed the topic when she saw me upset. She said you are trying not to disappoint her and win her love because she is literally like your mom! You wanna win her love this time. She apologized later. We both moved on from that topic..

**Did OOP get proper therapy to deal with the abandonment and abuse from her mother?**

> **OOP:** No I haven’t. I buried my head in to my books when I moved out. I was working and finishing my degree. I started grad school right away and that’s where I met Sarah . I wasn’t a virgin lol I never had a real long term relationship before Sarah . It was always casual because I was terrified of being abandoned so I would always make sure they knew it’s casual . When I met Sarah , I told her the same but she said she wasn’t going anywhere because she liked me a lot. Our casual hook ups turned in to dating and love

**Commenter 2:** NTA - but I want to ask.... Is Sarah the person you want to spend your life with if she can't understand that you are NC with your abusers?

&nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/pbNDMDfcxP): **November 14, 2024 (next day)**

Thank you for your comments and DMs. They really gave me perspective on my life. I sat Sarah down last night and explained my reasoning for not inviting my family. She kept saying, “That was a long time ago; they might not be the same people anymore.” I felt offended and said, “How on earth are you lecturing me when you’ve never even met them?”

Well, it turned out my mother has been in touch with Sarah. Sarah said they regularly meet for coffee dates and talk. I was about to cry because I was so angry. My mom changed the whole narrative, saying Bob was a father figure, a good, protective dad, and that it was me who didn’t love him back because, apparently, it’s my thing to play the victim. She claimed my aunt manipulated me and stole me from their family, trying to be a replacement for my mom. According to her, it’s all about my mother.

I screamed, “ARE YOU FOR REAL? Ask her next time on your coffee dates why I never had a birthday party growing up! Why was there never a gift under the tree for me? Ask Bob if he even knows when my birthday is, since he was such a loving dad! Why did my aunt have to pick me up before Christmas Eve because Bob wanted to spend the holiday with his kids, not with another man’s mistake?”

Sarah basically repeated what my mom has told me my whole life: “You just love to make a big deal out of everything, make yourself a victim, and push everyone away.” I told her she had no right contacting my mom. She said I was cruel and claimed she was just trying to help me mend my broken relationship. She even called my mom lovely and said Bob has changed a lot; he’s now an LGBTQ ally now that his princess is out ! I was floored. An ally? Maybe he should start by apologizing to me for terrorizing my entire childhood.

I told Sarah we are done. I can’t do this. Sarah sarcastically said, “You just proved your mom’s point! Go run to your aunt! Let that old witch run your life.” I told her she needs to find a new place ASAP, considering she’s not paying rent—I am. She got mad and asked what excuse I was going to make up this time to justify my “bullshit trauma.” I stopped replying. She went on a tirade, breaking our dinner plates. I didn’t care. I texted my aunt, and she asked if I wanted to spend the night at her place. I said I was fine.

I’m taking time off from work. I cleaned up the kitchen (which was full of broken dishware) in the morning because I didn’t want my cats to accidentally get hurt. Sarah is still sleeping. I’m going to see how I can legally evict her. I’m a complete mess, but I’ll talk to my aunt and uncle for help.

Yes, I am not starting to date again until I see a therapist and work on myself. I can’t keep going through this.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Just curious OP, if your family lives across the country how was Sarah having regular coffee dates with your mom?

> **OOP:** I explained later. That was the lie Sarah told her parents and I didn’t correct it. Yes I shouldn’t have lied to them. I should have taken the hint when she asked me to lie. We live in lower mainland , Vancouver and my mom lives in Abbotsford to be exact if you wanna check how far she lives away from us

**Commenter 2:** Where did you think your SO was when she was gone for 2+ hours on a coffee date with your mom? How did she do this weekly without you knowing?

> **OOP:** Sarah is between jobs that’s why I stopped charging her rent. I go to the office everyday . Probably during the day ? I’ll come back soon to answer to more questions . I’m very busy now

**Commenter 3:** Sorry you have to go through this. Still, it's better you have discovered what kind of person Sarah is before getting married. You owe this to your mom, at least something good came out from her direction 🤔.

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/umKSL2gIhU): **December 19, 2024 (one month later)**

I still get DMs asking for an update. 

1- Sarah moved out ! Finally. Her family cursed me and my aunt and uncle as they were packing her stuff. I asked my aunt and uncle to be there because I was terrified of her family lol. Luckily, they didn’t do anything crazy ! just a lot of verbal attacks 

2 - my mom left me a nasty voicemail. She said im a worthless human being and blew the best thing happened to me over some childish resentments . She said that’s who you are! Ungrateful spoiled brat! Her husband apparently raised me and I was ungrateful.. whatever mom! Leave me alone 

3 - I met with a therapist that I liked but he is going to retire soon due to health issues.. fml.. he referred me to his colleague. So new year , new therapists? 

4 - I’m not dating! I do a lot of social activities with my friends. Overall I’m very happy 

5 - next step? Who knows maybe save my money to take my auntie to a nice vacation? I don’t have many plans tbh haha

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Well your mom just loves confirming that she's still awful. Good on getting out. Dodged a lifetime of being treated like crap by your spouse, in laws, and bio mom.

**Commenter 2:** Did you ever get the inheritance from your dad? 

> **OOP:** Can a lawyer find out ? I don’t wanna contact my mother

**Commenter 3:** Sucks to have your life crumble because your ex turned out to either be a narcissist like your mother or just a useful idiot. Either way, they're not worth your time. You're better finding someone who loves and respects you, not some bitch who cared more about the look of her wedding.

**Commenter 4:** Damn that’s a crazy ride.  I’m glad you found out your ex is crazy before you married her.  

I come from a very family-oriented culture.  But I respected my wife’s wishes on who was and wasn’t invited to our wedding. You can do better

","I’m not sure if my mother is narcissistic, borderline, simply unwell, or a mix-and-match of a combination of all these things. She was a single mom and I’m her only child (daughter). Our relationship went sour in college and hasn’t recovered. I moved across the country and am now in my 30s, I usually visit once a year on Christmas (now!). 

I had a therapist in the path who introduced me to the idea my mom was a narcissist. My mother is impulsive, reactive, paranoid, odd. But a key trait of her since childhood is that she stays up all night and sleeps all day, when she’s not working. She doesn’t follow “normal” societal expectations well. Going home is always an anxiety induced experience that almost always never ends well.

I’ve tried to keep my cool this trip, I’ve done okay. We ended Christmas Eve night by agreeing to wake up and do stockings, have coffee as I was leaving at noon to visit my father. That would be our last hours together. To cut a long story short - she slept until 1p. Several times she got up, said she would be awake soon, and consciously laid back down. Just deliberately slept over the last morning and Christmas. A mix of child-like impulsivity and lack of giving a f*ck, I guess. This isn’t a first. She’s missed picking me up from the airport, missed helping with medical appointments, and often doesn’t answer calls for weeks because of sleep.

When she finally did get up, I spent my last hour there cold as ice and an absolute b*tch. This is not the first time she “can’t” wake up, couldn’t show up and behave normally. It’s always me navigating around her quirks, neurosis, or personality since childhood. When she realized I was mad I got the victimized  voice and she hit me with “I feel like you hate me, I can’t do anything right, I can’t help that I’m tired, Im sorry I didn’t behave how you wanted me to, how could you be mad at me” and then attempted to start other light hearted conversations but I was a brick wall.

Of course now, I’m away from her and riddled with guilt. It’s as if I react at a 100, because I both expect and fear things like this will happen. Underneath my anger, I suppose it’s hurt because it feels like she didn’t care enough to fight through whatever impulse or exhaustion she has. She never does. I genuinely don’t know if the explanation is is mental illness or self-centered behavior.

It’s always a cycle. Her self-centered or otherwise negative behavior happens, I react and stonewall almost like a trauma response, then feel SO guilty later. Almost where I become nonfunctional because of my guilt. Is this something you all experience? Does this sound like a narcissistic cycle, or just something else I need to work out?

Thanks all - and to anyone in this sub, wishing you a Merry Christmas even if it’s a hard one. ",2,1735189254.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

There, smoking a cigar, his dirty-blond dye-job blowing in the non-existent wind. His breath smells like coffee and napalm: it's him.

You shudder at the slight of his button-down shirt, about the same colour and texture as a coffee stain. He slowly takes off his reflective sunglasses and looks at you, stares intensely with his beady little eyes.

I'm looking for suggestions to keep myself occupied and make myself feel better and starting a list for anyone else in a similar position. ,"2024 was a horrific year for me. I got my ADHD and Autism diagnosis in August and although it didn't come as a shock at all, my life has come unglued. I guess you don't end up at the psychiatrist because you're doing well so it makes sense. I just turned 31 and I've never felt more lonely, depressed, anxious, exhausted and dissatisfied with life. I'm usually on the more organised / functional side of neurodivergent but this year I have neglected every aspect of life and it's all just a big old mess. My house, health, friendships, family relationships, self care, finances, etc. is the worst it's ever been and I feel like throwing my whole life in the trash and starting again.

I've been at home alone feeling depressed, lonely and sorry for myself. I've spent my first week off bedrotting and having anxiety freak outs and I think I'm sick of myself enough now that I want to try and do some stuff to make myself feel better. I just want to preface that this is my own list of what I find satisfying / interesting and like I'm making progress for myself and I'm not projecting this expectation onto anyone else.

I don't really have anyone to hang out with or much money to spend so my list is going to be mostly solitary cheap/free acititives. I'm mindful of trying to keep busy and feel like I'm making some progress and benefiting myself by getting my life back in order but not overdoing it and ending up feeling like I haven't had a break. I'm in no way expecting myself to get all of this done, it's just a list of if I feel like it, I might do it.

Anyways, here's my list of things I can pick from over the next couple of weeks to keep myself occupied and make a bit of progress in putting things back together. Please feel free to add your own suggestions.

Self Care / Personal

* Paint nails.
* Eyelash/eyebrow tint.
* Go for walks, go to the gym, decide if I want to keep my gym membership or not.
* Learn how to use my new Shark hairstyler thing (in progress).
* Spend time doing my 2025 goals diary and journalling (done / in progress). I do lists of all sorts of goals but try to make them fun ie. travel goals, hobbies, making new friends, exercise/health goals, stuff that's easy and fun to achieve and tick off.
* Go shopping and buy some new clothes for work.

Hobbies / Relaxing stuff

* Reading in the afternoons and letting myself nap if I feel tired.
* Watching Youtube videos themed around DIY, organisation etc. and seeing if the motivation strikes me.
* Browse reddit and other forums for shits and giggles. Post and participate more. 
* Crafts, cross stitch, painting, sewing if I feel inspired to do something.

Socialising

* Catch up with my mom now that the Christmas chaos has died down.
* See if I can meet with a friend for coffee.

Finances

* Do 2025 budget spreadsheet (mostly done).
* Write financial goals in my diary (done).

Cleaning / Organising / DIY

* Put away Christmas decorations.
* Clean out fridge and pantry.
* Organise kitchen cabinets.
* Grocery shopping and meal prepping.
* Deep clean / wipe down kitchen cabinet doors and counter tops.
* Wash curtains and dust/wipe blinds.
* Wipe door frames, window frames, base boards.
* Declutter / organise closet.
* Clean / organise my desk and hobby stuff.
* Clean out / declutter garage.

A few weeks after the housewarming, the “maybe coffee” had turned into regular coffee dates, then dinner, then… well, let’s just say things were definitely heating up. The dynamic was still hilariously familiar. I’d suggest a casual movie night, and Tony would meticulously research the best sound system setup for optimal viewing. I’d jokingly complain he was overthinking it, and he’d retort with a deadpan, “One does not simply ‘casually’ watch a film, Ms. Cooper.”

It was mid-December, and the city was buzzing with Christmas cheer. I was brainstorming gift ideas, and Tony was, predictably, focused on practicalities--going to get those boys snow tires for his truck.

He kept muttering ""Safety first"" these days.

I decided to take matters into my own hands. I knew Tony wouldn’t splurge on himself, so I started planning a surprise. I booked a cozy cabin in the Berkshires for the weekend before Christmas—a snowy, romantic getaway, complete with a fireplace and a hot tub. I even managed to coordinate with his sons to “borrow” him for the weekend, telling them it was a “client meeting.” They were in on the secret and thought it was a riot.

The day before our “client meeting,” I was at the condo, putting up some last-minute Christmas decorations. Tony was there, being Tony, meticulously checking something with the kitchen faucet.

“So,” I said, trying to sound all casual as I hung  a string of fairy lights, “any big plans for the weekend?”

“Just catching up on some paperwork. The usual.”

""Paperwork? Come on, where's your Christmas spirit?"" I took a breath and went for it. ""You know, I was thinking of heading up to the Berkshires. They're forecasting snow... if you wanted to join...""

Tony was quiet for a second.

Was he going to say yes? Was I totally misreading ...

“Ms. Cooper,” he finally said, “I… I wouldn’t want to inrude.”

I let out a breath. ""Intrude? I'm literally inviting you! It's not going to be any fun without you there.""

He finally cracked a genuine smile. “Alright, Ms. Cooper,” he said, his eyes twinkling. “Berkshires it is.”

The weekend was magical. The cabin was even cozier than I’d imagined, the snow fell softly outside, and the fireplace crackled merrily. We hiked through the snowy woods, played board games by the fire, and soaked in the hot tub under the starry sky. We talked about everything and nothing, laughing until our sides hurt.

On Christmas Eve, after a delicious dinner I’d attempted to cook (with Tony’s expert supervision, of course), we were sitting by the fire, sipping hot cocoa.

“This is… perfect,” I murmured, leaning my head on his shoulder.

“Almost,” he replied, and then, to my complete surprise, he pulled a small, beautifully wrapped box from his pocket.

“I… I didn’t get you anything,” I stammered, feeling a little flustered.

“You gave me this weekend,” he said softly. “That’s more than enough.”

I opened the box to find a delicate silver necklace with a small, intricately carved snowflake pendant. It was stunning.

“Tony, it’s beautiful,” I whispered, my eyes welling up.

He reached over and fastened it around my neck. “It reminded me of you,” he said, his voice low. “Unique, beautiful, and a little bit… stubborn.”

I laughed, and then, without thinking, I leaned in and kissed him.

It was a slow, sweet kiss, full of warmth and affection.

When we pulled away, he looked at me, a mixture of surprise and happiness in his eyes. “So,” he said, a playful glint in his eye, “does this mean I can finally stop calling you Ms. Cooper?”

“Definitely,” I said, grinning.

1hmh8rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hmh8rl/aita_for_not_apologising_to_my_brothers_girlfriend/,Aita for not apologising to my brothers girlfriend?,"I (29F) just moved back to my mums after three years of university, I went to school in another state so I'm living with her while I look for a new place. While I was gone my brother (31m) started a relationship with J (29f). At the start all I knew was second hand information about the relationship. My brother and I are close, but not talk all the time or text close, we mostly just send each other memes and nerdy videos. Mum and I spoke on the phone every few days though and she would keep me up to date with things.
Apparently, for the first few months of their relationship J kept it off and on, refusing to let my brother call himself her boyfriend, despite going on dates all the time. She would also randomly (from my second hand perspective) get upset and say things like he wasn't doing enough or being romantic enough, despite him booking fancy restraunts only for her to cancel last minute. Every time she cancelled on him it would upset him and he would try to understand, but she wouldnt give him a straight answer. 

I was confused by the whole relationship, but figured I wasn't getting the whole story.
 Then I moved back once.

J seems like a really lovely woman when youre sitting there talking to her. She's all smiles and jokes and everything is fine, but the moment she goes home she texts my brother and complains about our Mom and me.

The list of complaints about me in particular are this:
I don't talk enough.
I don't go out for coffee and to get my nails done with her.
She thinks I'm jealous of the time my brother spends with her.
She gets a weird feeling about me.
I am often on my phone or computer.
I don't hug her. 

Most of these things I have explained to her. I'm not super talkative, and since I've just moved and am between jobs it's not like I'm going out and doing interesting things to talk about. I also can't really afford to go out for coffee or get my nails done, but even if I could I wouldn't, I'm not into that kind of thing, never have been, and I don't know her well enough to want to go out like that with her. I'm also mostly on my laptop looking for work. 

Now, I understand insecurity about settling into a new family, but it's as though she's started a campaign against me. Everytime I see her she finds something at fault and my brother tells me all about how upset I've made her.  

Apparently none of this is new. All of these issues she has with me are the exact same she had with my mother before I came back. Almost word for word. And it was only my mums people pleasing and submission that made J stop accusing her of not being welcoming. Which I don't understand at all since my mum is the nicest person, even if she doesn't like someone, because of her massive people pleasing tenancies. She hates conflict and will laugh off offences, and be nice to the worst people, just so no conflict starts. 

From my perspective I have done nothing but be kind to J. I talk to her like I would anyone, I joke with her, comment when I have something to add to the conversation, and have never once said or done anything indicating any dislike. Hell, we've played Mario cart and I took an hour of little comments about how bad I was and just laughed with her about it (I am Bad). She even told my brother once that she felt unwelcome and purposefully not included because I hugged my mum when she was there and didn't hug her. 

The point is, I feel like me simply existing is some sort of crime when she visits? 
This last week the issue exploded. After constant comments from my brother that she's upset and doesn't feel welcomed again, and that I'm the reason because I dont talk enough or hug her, it all came together in a massive fight.

My brother came to me begging me to apologise to J. For what? I still don't know. I asked for a specific reason so I could understand what I'd done, but he didn't know and she wouldn't tell him. I just had to send her a message apologising to her and then she would be fine and would feel better and their relationship could go back to what it was. 

I got pretty upset. I felt like I was being vilainised for just existing, and that their relationship was being put on me to fix, like I had anything to do with it. It all felt entirely unfair and I refused. Vocally.

My mum got upset too, which only made me feel worse. She's not well and stress makes her sicker. She made the point that J was causing all this anger and upset in our family when we hadn't even done anything. Which I agree with. And she was also doing this without even being a part of it.

That's something else that still upsets me. She will never bring her issues to us directly, it's only ever second hand through my brother. She refuses to talk about it herself, and won't ever explain herself, not even to my brother. She just starts fights and sits back at her house fully removed and away from the conflict she's started. Then she comes back for a visit or dinner and acts like nothing happened. 

A few weeks ago we tried to sit her down and tell her she was welcome, and if she had any concerns to come talk to us so we could understand and help her. But she just said she would and never did.

Anyway, things got heated, we all yelled at each other, and I agreed to message J, if only to stop the fighting. 

I told my brother that without knowing what I'd done, I wasn't going to apologise, but I would send a message explaining my position, how everything on her list was not me disliking her, and I asked her to explain what it was I was doing that made her feel like this. The message was very carefully worded and pleasant. It was a long explanation and plea for understanding. But all I got back was a ""Thanks for reaching out. I understand 😊"". 

After that nothing response I felt like all this upset and strife was for absolutely nothing. Like all it had accomplished was proving to her that I will bend when she demands it of me. Maybe that feeling isn't warranted, I'm not sure, but that's how I feel. And I only felt worse when we saw her a day after the massive fight, and she acted like nothing had even happened and was happy and smiley like she hadn't caused a massive rift in my family. 

Now I am constantly dreading her visits, and am angry whenever I think about her. I told my brother i would never be put in this position again. I said I didn't care what happened, I will message J this once and i will never do something like this again. And that nothing will change how I act around her, since I am just being myself, and I will not apologise for that. 

So I need some outside perspective. Am I actually the problem? Should I change how I behave around her and force myself to talk more and hug her just to make her feel more welcome? I'm not sure if my anger is over exaggerated or warranted. 

Am I the asshole for not apologising?

On my way out of the theater I met a fellow named Gil, Gil noticed me absent mindedly humming and twirling thinking about Dolchinea's performance. He said my dancing was ""Hot"" which I didnt quite understand and offered to get me a drink at a tavern. I agreed because strange though his language may be he seemed like a nice fellow. 

Well then I arrived at Mountraines tavern and the dust and the spiderwebs made it clear that the place had seen better days. gil got me something to drink a dark bitter liquid he called ""coffee"" which we dont have at home,  an attempt was made to balance out the bitterness with cream and sugar but I think it might be more of an acquired taste. 

That being said Gil seemed like he could use something to help him out, he had a dream but seems now that he has abandoned it and his hope for the future. While his description of people like him being as ""Stardust in the wind"" was poetically beautiful it was also crushing to hear the men in this bar talk like every day was one slow trudging step toward oblivion.

I wanted to turn things around for Gil to show him that his dreams are not beyond reach to put some light and life back into this city that felt like it was humming with energy from the moment i arrived. So I asked for permission to dance, Gil said that I could (\^\_\^) although seemed confused as to what good it would do. I told him not to worry about that and to just get the place ready.  

I ran all around town finding people who may not have the money to afford tickets to the luxurious theater, or perhaps simply wanted a more low key evening. When I encountered them I greeted them and invited them to follow me back to Mountraines for a good evening of fun and drink.  That evening the Tavern was bustling, to help Gil out I even forwent my tips (I had made enough money dancing in every tavern from Cropdale to New Delsta and montraines really needed the money for repairs).

I have to say that as much as the Massive theater could hold so many more people there is nothing quite like the energy of a tavern full of people celebrating slapping the table just a little off time the chaotic energy that puts an infectious smile on the faces of even the dourest regulars. I think even if I do manage to achieve my dream and become a star I still want to dance in taverns from time to time. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Day Four\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It has been some time, I had been dancing every evening at Mountrains tavern for the better part of a week, Gil's regulars payed their tabs off which was impressive (It seemed I had motivated them enough to become employed) Gil was letting me stay in a room upstairs. It was kind sad that I hadnt heard the piano played since arriving however. It was then that I decided that I was going to stay at mountraines until I heard that piano sing under Gil's gentle ministrations. 

Gil mentioned that he forgot to do the grocery stop and he would have a floor filled with hungry lunchtime patrons if he didnt get some ingredients. I was happy to take care of it so he gave me the checkbook and told me what he needed. I did meet the theater manager on my way out. I must say the man does not appeal to me He comes across to me as the type who would lock away a beautiful work of art for fear that the eyes of poor people might sully it somehow.

An opinion that was confirmed when I returned to the tavern groceries in hand only to find the place trashed. Gil claimed he fell but unless he tripped and dropped the whole tavern into a milk separator I am not buy that, not for single leaf. That despicable theater director. Not only does he deprive the people of the city from viewing his acts with his outrageously expensive tickets but he also bullies other people and destroys their fun. I am going to give that man a piece of my mind. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Day Five\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Oww.... I had managed to sneak into the theater, got past all the guards and got access to the theater manager and while I can say he doesnt come across as elegant or graceful he does have a voice like a thunderstorm. A powerful shout kept me distracted for long enough for his actors to truss me up and throw me out. But I am not giving up, Mama always said ""the dance isnt done unless you choose to stop making the steps"". That being said my Papa always said ""Its better to work out a stitch isnt going to work early, picking and unpicking the same stretch of cloth over and over again can ruin it.""

So I need something that I can do to change the odds. I quickly dashed back to mountraines, apologised that I will fail to keep my promise and dashed out to the anchorage. I got on a boat back to Canalbrine because I had an idea. I had heard in the town of Connings Creek there was a medical school that trained a bunch of famous scholars I figured if i learnt a little about medicine I might be able to change the odds. While I was their a found a young man who could sing the most Befuddling Ballads and I figured a little luck can go a long way. After achieving both goals (learning some first aid and getting a new accompanist) I returned to new Delsta with renewed determination to give that man a piece of my mind. 

I will tell you it was challenging but I embraced what I knew Dodging attacks with elegant dance moves and striking back however I could. It would appear however that all the racket attracted some large stone monstrosity who arrived and then quickly pounded La'mani into the dirt before wandering off. After that I attempted to convince La'mani to promise to leave the tavern alone the man stubbournly refused until it turned out that Dolcinea had come to see what the racket was all about. It seemed like she was desperately offended that the Theater manager thought some Tavern Dancer was a challenge to her dignity and in short order had extracted from him the promise I had wanted. I left shortly after. 

I returned to montraines and noticed the place had been fixed up in the days that I was gone Gil had gotten to work the place was once again ready, with and we managed to get a crowd up. that being said when it came time for my  performance Gil sat at the keyboard. He said ""Hey Kid, someone with moves as Hot as your is a waste in this dustbin, but you made me dream again, so after tonight the people hear are going to be putting on our own performances, you need to fly this place and continue to spread hope alright! "" And so that night I danced while Gil played. 

That evening all sorts got up to try their hands at various art forms, some sang, some danced some did standup comedy routines. Most of them couldn't be described as good, but people loved them anyways and I dont think it was the drink either. While some did have wine or other strong drinks the smell of Coffee overwhelmed the scents of liquor. I think that most people just wanted to be supportive. No one starts amazing Sealticge only knows how much practice I had to do to get where I am today and most of the performances had a grain of talent in them.

I met this girl in my part-time Master’s class. We both smiled at each other once during a break, and that’s how our initial crushes began. I took the initiative to text her first, and things started off great—she seemed to enjoy texting me and replied quickly.

However, I made the mistake of asking her out for coffee too soon. She pulled back, saying she only wanted to talk about class, and since then, that’s all we’ve talked about. For six months, our conversations have been limited to classwork. She rarely engages beyond 1–2 texts per week, and if I try to steer the conversation to a personal topic, she either ignores it or gives a vague answer.

Funnily enough, that's how she treated the very few classmates that knew her too, boys and girls alike. She's very shy, works in the cyber security field, and barely show her information or what she thinks to anyone, so it makes people get to know her very difficult. For example, when one of our classmates, “T,” tried to get to know her better and mentioned they lived nearby, she got suspicious and even asked to see T’s ID card. Even after seeing it, she refused to say which town she lived in.

She’s also an overthinker, which seems to make her indecisive. I don’t blame her entirely—I’ve made mistakes too. There was a time I didn’t text her for a whole month, and I also talked to too many people in class about my crush on her, which I think made her uncomfortable. I don’t know how she feels about me now. Sometimes she texts back enthusiastically, and other times she completely ignores me. It’s emotionally taxing, and I feel like I’m being strung along, even though I’m trying not to overthink it.

I suspect she’s afraid to show emotions because she thinks I’ll rush her or overwhelm her again, like when I asked her out for coffee, because after that, we can't even have conversations as comfortable as we used to.

So now this left me two solutions:

\- Write her a note explaining my feelings about the last six months. I suspect this will likely end things (or take us to the next steps), as she rarely shows emotion and might not respond well to this level of openness

\- Step back completely—no texts, no talking in group projects, no wishing her a Happy New Year—and see if she reaches out or reacts in any way.

It's taking a toll on me more than I thought, and tbh, I'm started to lose interest in her. Despite telling myself I can help her and a part of her really pity her, because of her personality and overthinkiness, she doesn't have that many friends. When talking to her, I learned a lot of thing that I need to improve, which makes me want to know her more, on why she's like that. She's much more than this and I know that, but I'm kinda stuck between a place and a rock.

If you guys have suggesstion and thoughts, please lmk. And thank you for reading this far.

My plan was to get off of work in the morning, see my parents, nap at their house for a few hours, and then catch up with them at my grandparents house later. 

I ended up sleeping through my alarms and texting them barely awake “I’m trying to come what’s the address” at what was basically 1 am, 2 am, 3 am, 4 am for me. I woke up fully when my parents came home. And they were not happy that I “blew it off to sleep.”

I feel so bad. I’ve been crying all night feeling like the worst person. I had worked multiple shifts in a row leading up to Christmas Eve and I’m working again tomorrow night. Having that one odd “day off” in between is so disorienting. 

This is my first holiday season working this job and I’m discovering I’m not liking the holidays. People are calling off left and right in addition to our staffing ratios already being changed. My schedule for the holiday got messed up too with all the requests off. I was basically working every other night to accommodate the more senior nurses until I got it changed. 

The beds are all full too and yet somehow I still manage to get an admission at shift change every time. Family is crawling around the bedside with it being Christmas time which makes it hard to get any work done when they’re in my way, breathing down my neck, asking questions I can’t answer, questions I’ve already answered, asking for water, wanting a cup of coffee, needing a snack, needing extra pillows and blankets, asking when the doctor will come in the morning which is something I can’t answer because I’ll be home, coming up to the nurses station with requests, following me around the hallway.

Now I slept through Christmas and am going to have to make it up to my family later. ",18,1735188205.0,nursing,9,0.92,False

I feel like I've been eating a ton of crap the last two days - but upon reflection, it truly hasn't been that terrible. Christmas Eve morning I had an egg white scramble with broccoli and my protein coffee. For lunch, half a bagel - the most carbs I've had in one sitting in months - with a little butter. I did indulge in a few cookies/cheese and crackers and two chicken breasts (really one split in half.) Today we had Chinese food , and I used a salad plate so I wouldn't overdo it. I had some chicken and broccoli (heavy on the broccoli) and a few bites of sesame chicken. I had half a donut as well as thee homemade (small) latkes with unsweetened apple sauce. Let's not forget my daily Metamucil as well!

Is this how I've typically been eating? No. And I'm down the 33.4 pounds to support that. Am I upset with myself and going to punish myself with starvation and extra exercise if the scale goes up?

1hmgzo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1hmgzo0/10_things_ive_learned_over_the_year/,10 Things Ive learned over the year,"Just wanted to say Happy Holidays and a Happy New Years to the healthygamer community, and with that I also wanted to make an appreciation post about everything that I learned throughout the year partly due to healthygamer and external resources.

I want to lead with probably the biggest one that changed everything for me was

1. Thinking about thinking. Therapy and healthygamer subtly teach you how to do this overtime, but it really levels up your awareness of your self, your surroundings, and the people around you. As Ive heard Dr K say in a video ""diagnosing is half the battle"" once you can diagnose where your thinking stems from you are able to treat it more effectively. A year ago i could have told you that I have a gaming problem and I am aware that its a problem but I cant do anything about it. Now I can tell you that I have a problem with gaming when I stop prioritizing and start avoiding task that I dont feel comfortable doing because of certain external or internal factors, and these feelings occur because of past trauma or immediate instant judgmental reactions that occur because something is mildy inconvenient when it happens.
2. You have to feel all the emotions even the ones that are subconsciously blocked. Now this is probably the biggest thing and its the thing that Healthygamer has been talking a lot lately, but this is where I over the years have seen people take the stoic route and try to actually inadvertently avoid feeling the emotions. I am guilty of this too. While i was going through my depression I noticed that when i get sad or have large amounts of feeling I would feel a lump in my throat. Normally I would just bottle it up. It would come larger every time until one day i decided to just yell. Yell at the top of my lungs. That was my physical release. All the emotions came through, lots of tears, but also in conjuction with 1) thinking about thinking, I was able to really get into where the feelings were coming from and how they were effecting my day to day, which translate to how my life is going.
3. Fantasies of you winning an argument are also thoughts and emotions. This really opened me up to what i wanted in life and helped me get closer to my overall purpose. but I would have fantasies winning arguments in the shower or just romanticizing big dreams. You can get down to where these thoughts and emotions come from like for instance, I owned the bully if I said this line at this moment instead of nearly crapping my pants. What I wanted really was to be respected and stand up to the bully, because the way he treated me made me feel small, and I feel that I am much bigger as a person than that.
4. You either change with the world or it leaves you behind. This is really common with the rapid growth in technology and really since the dawn of civilization. We see it in the healthygamer channel and community. people change and adapt, well those who are willing. You cant change them you can only change yourself, so when the world isnt going with your plan the only way to fix that is to fix you. Updating your logic and the way you view things really keeps you mentally nimble.
5. If things arent working for you as you are now, its okay to let them go. family members, jobs, thought processes, relationships. Everything is external to you, and even the things internal to you. You are an individual made up of experiences, when new information is conflicting with those experiences, rewriting them into you creates something new and beautiful. People come and go, thought processes come and go, jobs come and go. Dont get tied up in what was when what is in front of you requires your attention.
6. I no longer prioritize happiness, I prioritize authenticity. Happiness is an emotion and like all emotions it comes and goes, trying to maximize happiness is like trying to do any other drug. Youll need more and more of it to sustain it, and it will not ever reach the peaks youre looking for. Being authentic is a state of being. This in my opinion is what makes humans unique and individuals. Every one has different sense of selves because every one is fundamentally different, yet we are all the same. Being authentic to yourself is what really fuels you and gives you the energy to do and be more.
7. Everything shapes you who you are. People, environment, jobs, relationships, and anything you put into your mental. This is a fun one to test, but I love to play the algorithm game on YT or Instagram. I will pick one thing and try to make it my entire for you page. It really shows how the alogrithm works in the backgrounds and its a really good example. If you are looking up big boobas on instagram, all your going to get is thrist traps, search anime edits youll get anime edits. News article youll get news articles. at first it seems like a no brainer but then when you start to play with it you get a scale of what the internet does to you. This also goes physically, if you are drinking soda and coffee all day, youre going to need more to be sustained.
8. Wishing something is wrong with you so you can fix it doesnt actually solve what it is. I know i am guilty of this, but I was convinced that i was ADHD and autistic, went and got tested and failed for both, but online i took every test read everything and was like thats just like me for real. I cried after failing both because I believed that that was fixable and I could finally fix me. Really what it was, was that I was not aware enough of my behavior and surroundings that were symptoms of my depression and anxiety and or the causes of them.
9. Therapy and mental health as it is in its current state is really hard to tailor to a mass audience. I see a bunch of complaints about the new way healthygamer plays the titles, and yes I do agree that it can get clickbaity but it has merits. The videos are snippets of topics that are meant to get you to think and then apply to you current thinking, which goes back to number 1. thinking about thinking. If you are unable to think about thinking and at the start I was in this boat, I just binged content and said this just like me fr. It really is meant to supplement mental development, its not meant to replace it and I believe that a lot of people get the two mixed up. the more independent I become mentally, the less and less i use therapy and healthygamer and motivational gym bro lets go fight monsters and die like men edits.
10. Reproducibility is the key to success. Learning why you have good days and learning why you had bad days is such a game changer. I dont know if Dr K has talked about this, he may have just in snippets throughout varies videos, but Reproducing success and learning from failures really allows you to change your projection, I know during the ludwig stream they made a reference to Mahjoras mask about the 3 days, its just 3 days over and over again and people use those 3 days poorly and ask themselves why am I not where I want to be life. The reproducible part can be super small, as simple as brushing your teeth, this for me is what really started forming habits. I was able to form a system that allowed me to successfully do the things day to day that I wanted to do that made me feel good and then also move me towards my goals.

I really appreciate the growth and scaling that Healthygamer is doing and I am glad the community around it exist. I understand that its getting bigger and bigger so its going to feel less personalized. I just wanted to make this in hopes that some will be able to grasp that in order to make healthygamer personalized is to tack what Dr K and co talk about in conjunction with personal experiences as new lens to comb through your life with. For me doing that allowed for exponential growth, its like Dr K says its physics, once you start and dont stop you will make tremendous progress. starting and stopping will only get you 5 steps when ideally you would be a mile ahead.",7,1735188029.0,Healthygamergg,2,1.0,False

1hmgvjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hmgvjx/first_christmas_with_my_bf/,First Christmas with my bf ,"This year was me and my boyfriend's first Christmas together at our own flat after 4 years of dating. We always spent Christmas Eve and Christmas at our parents separated, which I never had problem with. Christmas celebration at my parent's house is typical, not without occasional argument, but nice. On the other hand, my boyfriend's family is very broken, but still they pretend everything is normal. 

My bf LOVES Christmas, it's his favourite holiday and it always broke my heart to see him spent Christmas with his family. They use him to make all the preparations because he cares and wants them to have Christmas, but they never care or show gratitude. Often they are not even at home, multiple times father came for few days and left before Christmas Eve for abroad work and sibling hates it there, so she is rather with her husband in another town. And no, they do not have to work, his father is home only 3 months of the year, he works as a hotel staff abroad, he didn't even attend his child's wedding. Mother is a nurse, so that could be acceptable, but still she makes priority of work. They never in his life visited him/us. They always gift socks and shampoos only. My bf tried to tell them, he always buys expensive gifts they want to show them how it's done (he bought coffee machine and automatic vacuum for example).

I tried for many years to get along with them, didn't even believe my bf when he told me how bad it is with his family, I thought he was overreacting. They all ignore it and make the bare minimum to make it work. I am at a point where I don't want anything to do with them anymore. We still didn't tell my parents how his family works, we often make excuses, omit and make better versions of events at bf'd house. 

Anyway, this year I was very excited to make the best Christmas possible, to show my bf that Christmas can be good and nice. Everything was perfect, be bought pyjamas from Home Alone (his favourite film), prepared food beforehand (he hates preparation after 23th), bought tree, on 24th we had little photoshoot and sent postcards. After writing and sending pictures to everyone I asked him to let let the FB be and enjoy our day, play games, watch his favourite movies and eat dinner. We prepared the rest of our dinner sat down and ate.

We had a whole plan after dinner, watch movies, eat ice cream, drink eggnog, just have fun and open presents in the morning. But suddenly, I barely finished with my food, he asked my if he could call his mother. She is alone at Christmas, nobody wants to be with her because she is very narcissistic and pushes everyone away, children and husband. My bf often has to be in the role of man in the house, he doesn't even live at home. His parents often told him he is substitute husband for his mother and the only time they call is when they need something from him. His mother doesn't even pick up the phone when he called her to wish her happy birthday. 

Of course I tell him to go ahead and call right after dinner, can't forbid him something like that. But then the phone call starts... She criticizes everything he tells her, he is enthusiastic about everything we prepared, ignores her negativity and agrees with things he told me he hates just to make her happy (that he can't wait to go and build their garage for them). She complains about people, about work and I just can't listen, so I leave the room. He comes and apologizes for her, but what is done is done. I really tried to get over it, but I got sad for the rest of the evening, we watched movies and ate food, but at 22:00 I wanted to go lay down. We had plans to stay up late, but I was just so out of it. 

The next day, the argument began, and we told each other these were the worst Christmas and he told me I am the only person who made him hate Christmas. We called my parents the day after, we still didn't open our presents.

Michael and Daniel were the first to wake up to light the wood stove in the living room. Afterward Michael got to work on making cinnamon rolls for breakfast while.Dniel.focused on bringing in wood for the fire. 

Unlike most traditional families, there was no plastic or even a real Christmas tree somewhere in the living room. When Michael was three their family was stretched thin. Daniel was inbetween jobs and they relied on Cassandra waiting tables. At some point during that year, a sugar pine had been planted in the front yard, more than likely the seed had lodged itself in Daniel's boot from work and found itself a perfect place to grow. 

Through the years the tree had become a part of the family. It bore a yellow ribbon Cassandra tied around it when Michael was deployed. It sheltered Daniel when he was at a loss for what to do. It provided Michael wih a view down the Mad River to the Pacific and beyond.

""I remember the rain that Christmas,"" Daniel replied with a laugh,  ""your mother was so pissed."" 

""Good times."" Michael said before taking a drink. 

""Your mother will be out of bed soon, is Gettret up yet?"" 

""If you think I can sleep when Mike's baking you don't know your own son."" Came a voice from the living room. 

""Guess that answers that question.""

After the rolls were finished baking, Michael.coated them heavily with a raspberry butter cream frosting and made sure everyone's coffee was full. Presents were past around and the tradition of unceremoniously ripping pretty colored paper to shreds began. The presents beneath were all thoughful, things that were necessities more that anything, but cherished none the less. After the last shred of paper had been cleared Michael picked up the plates and coffee cups, refilling them for the second time as Gettret served. 

""Oh honey I'm stuffed."" Cassandra replied when she saw the new roll. 

""Please miss.."" 

""Just mom, or Cassy. You're a part of the family now like.it or not."" 


""That's why the cinnamon rolls actually."" Gettret replied shyly. 

""What do you mean dear?"" 

Michael exited the kitchen with his own plate and mug. ""It's part of our last gift to you for Christmas."" 

""I don't get it Mike."" Daniel said taking the offered plate. 

""Gettret and I..."" 

""Mike's horrible at these things,"" Gettret laughed, ""He is hinting at it with the frosting."" 

Daniel and Cassandra looked at their plates again in confusion.

""Dad asked yesterday if we could have a baby."" Michael said. ""That was the reason Gettret went home last week."" 

Confusion was replaced with shock as both of Michael's parents picked up the hint. 

""Surprise, it's a girl."" ",26,1735187563.0,HFY,4,0.96,False

I woke up 2 days ago with upper back pain, awful burning pain between shoulder blades, and that pain just got worse as the day went on and into the next day. It seems to be worse when I exert myself at all as well. In addition to that I've had some mild nausea and poor appetite as well as a persistent cold/burning sensation in my throat. 

These symptoms definitely sound like gastritis, I had a bad episode a while back but the back pain is new and it is by far the worst part. It's excruciating. I can't help but be scared and alarmed that this is happening despite me taking Omeprazole daily already. I have been eating mostly whatever I want, drinking coffee, but avoiding spicy food and tomatoes, and been fine, until 2 days ago. I will try to see a GI doc but I am not established with one yet. 

Has this happened to anyone else? My mind is kind of jumping to scary things because of this happening suddenly while I'm already on PPIs.

1hmgoaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hmgoaj/an_unjust_consequence/,An Unjust Consequence,"When I was a kid, I used to walk among the trees in the forest behind my house whenever I got bored, or whenever I felt the urge to, and as a result, I found a large assortment of things, ones that wouldn’t really matter to most people, but to me they did.



Old bottle caps, dirty rings, the type of things you might accidentally step on when hiking through a thoroughly walked trail; as I said, things that wouldn’t warrant a second thought from the average person.



Sometimes I would bring my metal detector out into the forest to aid in my search for, how I saw them, the artifacts of careless people’s dropped pieces of history. 



Now that you understand what I was doing out there, I can give you the rest of the story, although I’m not necessarily sure it’s something you want to hear.



On one of my excursions into the forest, which was exceedingly deep to a young man, I found a small piece of scrap metal with a large ‘N’ carved into it, which excited me, because that just so happened to be the first initial of my name. What was weird though, was the fact that it didn’t seem to be a cutoff point for a larger sign, unless the letters on said sign had been set extreme lengths apart from each other.



As I looked around onto the soft dirt ground, I noticed small shavings of steel spread patternlessly around below my feet, as if the inscription had been made after the hunk of metal had been dropped off in the woods.



Although this would be odd to any individual with critical thinking developed to an at least semi-passable capacity, it wasn’t to me, which can be excused by the fact that I was young, although, there are many times I wish that I had just walked away.



Excitedly, I picked up the sheet of metal, but when I did, I felt a sharp prick in the palm of my hand, and yanked it back suddenly. At first it didn’t hurt, not after the initial shock of the small injury, but when I pulled my hand towards my line of sight only to see blood dripping down from a small, and strangely triangular-shaped wound in my hand, I began to cry.



For some odd reason, I felt compelled to keep the strange sheet of metal with me, so I hucked it up inbetween my arm and my stomach and ran the 2 minutes back to my house.



When I got home I was immediately greeted by my mother, who’s warm expression quickly changed to one of confusion and concern as her eyes shifted from the metal sheet to my teary-eyed face and disturbed demeanor. 



“Jeez, Nate, what happened to you?” She asked, her voice was the comforting type, and it calmed me down a little bit, but didn’t distract me from my bleeding hand. 



I managed to muster up the ability to explain to her what happened without my voice completely breaking again through my tears, and she seemed just as confused as I was when I first found the metal sheet.



“That’s weird, and it didn’t cut you again when you were carrying it back?” she asked, and I gave her a quick nod to say no.



We communicated back and forth for a little while, but eventually the conversation ended, and the metal sheet was tossed in the trash, although I protested against it in hopes I could hang it on my door as a cool decoration.



The next night I was laying in bed, asking myself stupid questions that genuinely seemed reasonable to me, such as; “if I attached a fan to my head and turned it on, would I fly like a helicopter?”.



I continued into my deep philosophical search for another 10 minutes before I heard something strange, a beeping sound was coming from underneath the very blanket I rested under.



I threw my blanket up to try and find the source of the beeping, and was perplexed to see a small red light going on and off inside my hand, just barely visible through the flesh. 



That perplexion quickly turned into terror as I remembered the metal sheet and the strange triangular wound. I raised my hand up to my face and looked at it closer, the red light was small but very noticeable in the dark.



I laid there, sweating lightly and staring intently at my hand which was now beeping red, providing little to no light in the pitch black room I slept in. 



I decided that I would ignore it that night and go to my mom about it in the morning. With the decision made, I threw my blanket back over my body and tried my hardest to sleep, until I heard a burly voice come from beside me.



“Hello, Nathan” it said, and my head snapped to the right to catch a glimpse of the man speaking to me. I stayed silent, and looked at the large figure in front of my eyes. Looking back he was maybe only around 6 foot, but to my young mind he was gigantic.



I started to cry and the man continued to stand over me. “Don’t worry sonny, It’ll all be over soon.” he replied, and placed his hand on the top of my head, which caused me to immediately pull back.



After that, the man just stood there, staring at me as I slept. After a few hours he pulled a small scalpel out of his pocket and made a small incision in my hand, then pulled out a small beeping piece of metal. At this I became so frightened I passed out, my body not knowing what to do in the situation it was presented with.



The next morning I woke up in a daze, confused as to whether or not I had really experienced what had happened to me the night before, but my suspicions were confirmed when I looked at my hand to see stitches running down the top of my backhand, and nearly reaching my wrist bone. 



I walked out of my room to find my mother, but she wasn’t in the house. 



I went to every room and checked it twice, making double sure that my mom wasn’t in them, all the while calling out for her.



Suddenly, as I made my final round to the bathroom, I heard the door that connected my house to my garage swing open. “Mom?” I loudly spoke into the area of the house I heard it in. 



“Yes sweetie, I’m home” she responded.



“Where were you? I was really scared, my hand is-” I spoke but was cut off by my mother’s voice. 



“I know honey, I know, I got it all sorted out, the man who hurt you won’t come back anymore” she said.



“How did you know about-” I was again cut off by my mom.



 “I saw him leaving our house last night, and I called the police to come and get him” she said, and made a nabbing motion with her hands, like a crocodile’s jaw snapping down onto its prey.



I looked over at the stitches on my hand again, and shuttered at the sight of them.



“Thank you mom” I said, and went over to her to get a hug.



The next night I laid again in my bed, my eyes looking over the figures made shapeless by the void of the darkness, trying to connect shapes that I saw to what they were when the lights were on.



As I looked over the dark landscape of my room, I saw a shape I hadn’t seen before the lights disappeared, the figure of a large man, and a sharp object extending from his darkened hand.



I screamed and the figure quickly began to move toward my window, then throwing it open with ease. Just as my mom ran into the room, the man jumped from the window and into the cool night.

  
I wondered if perhaps I deserved this, as a consequence for stealing the man's sheet of iron, I don't know what drove me to think that, perhaps it was just my underdeveloped mind trying to reason with the trauma of an unknown man breaking into my house twice, once to cut me open, and the other to do god knows what.



I never heard or saw anything relating to the strange man again, or at least not up until recently, when I read an article that was printed in a local newspaper.



“MAN TERRORIZES FAMILY” was scrawled across the top of the paper in large black letters.



 “In Hathaway  just this evening, a man was arrested after the prolonged stalking of a family of four that lived peacefully in the town. The man has been identified as 'John \*\*\*\* Jr'. and during a recent court meeting, it was revealed that he had been accused of, and successfully convicted of stalking in the past, but had escaped the small county prison he was held in within the first night of being kept there.” the article read.



I gazed at the article for just a few more moments before I put it down onto my coffee table, and walked away, letting it slip my mind once again.



Just a few days ago an article appeared on my phone notifications, a recommendation from a service I had been meaning to cancel my subscription for. “Missing boy linked to missing convicted stalker from Jabbot county” It read, and to the side of the text was a full quality (although now more aged) picture of the face of the man who I had only seen from the limited visibility of a dark room illuminated very dimly by the moon when I was just a child.

What should I know before using it? I’ve seen others take full scoops and regret it. Thanks",2,1735186642.0,Preworkoutsupplements,3,1.0,False
