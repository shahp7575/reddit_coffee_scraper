1pmkuef,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1pmkuef/how_much_time_do_you_spend_actively_interacting/,How much time do you spend actively interacting with your kids as a stay at home parent?,"I am really struggling with the level of interaction my oldest child requires from me and the entire family. I've been a sahm since he was born (may 2026) and spending every day with me is all he knows. Here we are 3+ years later, he thinks family time is all the time and we should all be happy together 24/7 😬 he wakes up first thing in the morning (used to be 4:30, luckily now 6 is sleeping in) ready to be actively engaged and yet won't take the lead. I will be bundled in a blanket with my coffee barely alive to the world and he's asking me what should we do... and spends the entire rest of the day asking ""what's next?"" almost... incapable? of choosing to do anything for himself during free time. He literally just sits there and waits for me to be ready. When my gears finally start turning and I give a stab at imitating a play session, it almost always turns to shit. He runs through my play promts in 10 seconds like a box to tick off, just stares at me waiting for the next one. Never gets bored, never ever in his life walks away to do his own thing. He has a 2 year old sister that even gets tired of him and tells him to go away, and he only directs like 25% of his attention on her - if I'm unavailable mostly 🫠 to try and sum it up.... As a family, we cannot get him to figure out that time at home is simply \*free time\* i tell him do whatever you want! He has free access to playdoh, basic arts and craft supplies, a toy room (that i even rotate our toys to keep it interesting), a dress up rack. We go on a walk or errand together almost every day. I always offer him to join my tasks if appropriate. we definitely do play together! We build castles, forts, play with characters, do puzzles... he wants his entire day to be social and if possible he would connect his brain to mine and have me control him like a video game. I started writing this last night after a difficult day, got tired and gave up. It's 10am next day and the whole family is about to have a breakdown because he won't just find something to do, because it's fun to have something to do 🤷🏼‍♀️ genuinely he will not find something for himself to do of his own choosing, ever. I think it goes without saying but we are obviously a screen time monitoring family - he could spend hours watching a show he doesn't even like and never tear himself away from the tv. No tablets ever. Me and my husband model alone time by saying we need to take breaks, laying down to read a book, working on a personal project. He is completely capable of playing alone and can do so for almost an hour if we force it, but still doesn't understand that when alone time is over that doesn't mean we suddenly have to be actively engaged with each other all the time. He really wants social stimulation just all the time. 

I don't know if any of this makes sense. I love my child deeply and taking a lot of solace in knowing I am his comfort. However I'm also deeply antisocial and really just trying to figure out how to balance what is good for both of us 😩 for all of us! I am genuinely so curious what other stay at home days look like for people. What are we doing with the vast amount of time in a day? How much time do you play with your kids? How do you model independent time? ",1,1765736148.0,Parenting,1,1.0,False

i know hpa operators have a set way in which they like to run their equipment. there are times i just let a system fly and other times i like to be extremely aware of data. sometimes I set spray cycles for a once and done from beginning to end, other times i adjust as needed. 

  
when I did make this first one back in 19’ and then in 20’ it did not have this resolution that it does now, beginning prototypes were much looser with resolution and timing. 

  
having the means to real time and hourly have values, I was able to incorporate that into my spray cycle for automation against slow transpiration increases, or drastic increases and decreases against day and night photosynthesis rate changes when I was trying to maintain a constant dtw ml output .

  
some of my systems worked just well as a set it and forget it,others loved constant attention depending on what I was doing.

  
this little prototype here, connects all the possibilities together. 

since winter is full swing, and coffee is still affordable- I think it’s time I design and package this into a one unit instead of wires everywhere. 

  
does something like this have any value in the real world, to hobby minded? labs? or do I just have too much time on my hands 😂 ",1,1765736121.0,aeroponics,0,1.0,False

Hey! I’m 25, based and working in Makati. I work in the BPO industry, so my body clock’s kinda flipped. Outside work, you’ll probably catch me playing basketball, going on long walks, or chilling at a coffee shop (I have a customized Starbucks drink that always costs extra 😅). I’m also into sneakers, cooking, and F1.

Honestly, I’m just looking for my go-to person  someone I can vibe with on coffee runs, random errands, or just be my safe space.

1pmksaq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pmksaq,The New Twist by Pro Lively,"*Posting for a friend who apparently doesn't have post karma or something like that. I started a new demanding job and haven't been able to keep up with the case as much, so this is quite interesting*


Post:

Team Lively is campaigning a new twist now that they've seen how ridiculous Blake's sexual harassment claims were.

The new angle is that the ""sexual harassment"" was not sexual, but based on the sex/gender. This gives them the opportunity to get away with saying JB ""sexually harassed multiple women."" Knowing damn well that *no one* who hears think will think anything other than he harassed them in a predatory sexual way.

They have decided that Alex Sak's deposition proves pervasive SH on the set, and so based on on her testimony, all the women were SH'd. 

Going by their new pivot:

- Alex Saks being yelled at by Justin at a high-stress job = Sexual Harassment (because she's a woman) 

- Christy Hall being told ""No"" when she wanted to direct a film that wasn't hers = Sexual Harassment (because she's a woman) 

- Isabela being asked to accept a subpoena = Sexual Harassment (because she's a woman) 

- Jenny Slate being told her *leather pants* were sexy + being offered $15, 000 to assist with housing because she's a new mom = Sexual Harassment (because she's a woman) 

- Claire Ayoub *allegedly* experienced verbal abuse = Sexual Harassment (because she's a woman) 

- Colleen Hoover...er, um...I don't even know with this one. Blamed Justin for a bunch of shit [*LIED about not seeing the script, complains about a tattoo mistake that BLAKE made but Justin fixed for 100k, complained about coffee table book proceeds that BLAKE got cancelled, complained about a documentary that didn't happened because she said no to it] and *somehow* that still equals Sexual Harassment (because she's a woman)

This sentiment is being spread in the two new subs that pop up hoarding Baldoni hate.

I personally think this is being pushed out by Blake's PR team itself.

1pmkqxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sourdough/comments/1pmkqxz/help_making_mini_boules_for_gifts/,Help making mini boules for gifts…,"Hello! I’m planning to make “sourdough flights” to give to my neighbors as Christmas gifts. I’m trying to work through the logistics so I don’t over-complicate the process. I’m a home baker, so baking large quantities intimidates me. I’m making a small test batch today to experiment, but I know this community probably has some awesome advice. Here are some of my plans/questions:

-I’m making 12 flights, and each flight will have 3 boules. One rosemary garlic, one white chocolate cranberry, one plain. (Plus a little jar of jam and some compound butter.) I’ll need to make a total of 36 boules. My plan is to make a triple batch of each flavor (3 full size loaves) and split it into 12 boules. 

-Bannetons: I don’t have minis (and they’re pricey), so I’m planning to use small plastic cereal bowls. I have tea towels I could cut up to line them with, or I thought maybe I could use coffee filters? Will coffee filters stick to the dough? Is there a better way?

-Cold proofing: Fridge space is a challenge this time of year. I live in the Midwest, and we often use our unheated garage as a makeshift fridge. (If you know, you know.) If I were to put them out in the garage overnight, what ambient temperature would be best? (Fingers crossed we don’t have an unseasonably warm Christmas!)

-Baking: this is where I’m really stumped. I have a double oven range but my top oven is too short for a Dutch oven. I have 3 Dutch ovens, but I’m thinking I can only get 2 boules in each. This will take many hours to bake 36 boules. I really don’t want to invest in mini Dutch ovens for this. I could try an open bake? All I have is basic cookie sheets, though, and my oven typically doesn’t hold steam super well. I have a roasting pan but it doesn’t have a lid… Would covering it in foil be a good option to hold in steam? Any other hacks for this?

-Packaging: I’m thinking a 10”x10”x3” cardboard pie box will work? I’m open to other ideas here. I want to see how tall my test loaves are before I order anything.

In that post, I made a reference to an experience I had improvising a method to get permanent marker off a dry erase board that got more interest than I expected. I thought I covered it, but some commenters still wanted more details, so I'm posting separately. 

Some years ago, I was doing contracted in-company training work. One place I taught at had a pretty small dry erase board in their meeting room. One day, I arrived and found somebody had written on the board with permanent marker, which severely compromised how much space was left. Kind of pissed me off. I had some time before class, so I considered what I could do about it. 

The cleaning supplies were all locked up, and being a contracted outsider I didn't feel comfortable bothering anybody about that as they'd probably look at me funny. Why does the contracted trainer want cleaning supplies? While pondering my available resources, I came up with: 

1. Bathroom paper towel

2. Bathroom hand soap

3. Free coffee

Soap was a non-starter, so I figured, what the hell? The coffee costs nothing, it'll come out of the machine hot, and it is mildly acidic. Maybe? 

I picked the ""espresso"" option in order to get the highest potency and no milk and opted for no sugar. I dipped some paper towel in the coffee, scrubbed and... it worked. Took a little elbow grease, but the marker went away after just a couple minutes of work. 

I have since been informed that it would have been easier to write over the permanent marker with dry erase marker, so the solvents would break down the perm marker and allow it be erased, but I was quite proud at the time that I figured something out. 

I don't imagine many of you will ever face this exact scenario, but it's worth taking from my experience that coffee can be some level of cleaning resource in the right application and level of desperation. ",2,1765735525.0,CleaningTips,0,1.0,False

1pmkicw,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/1pmkicw/office_gifting_feels_excessive/,Office gifting feels excessive,"I joined my current organization earlier this year. I have one direct report and am overall part of a decently large team at my primary work location. Here is my problem: this office is obsessed with gifting and gift exchanges. 

I have never liked Secret Santa that much (just not my thing) but have always done it at past offices to be part of the team. This office apparently does multiple gift exchanges throughout the year. We had Boo Baskets at Halloween (I tried to not participate in that one and the office manager came and asked me personally) and we are doing multiple weeks of Secret Santa gifts throughout December. There doesn't really seem to be a dollar limit on this stuff, either. I have also been asked to participate in gifting for the national recognition weeks we celebrate in our field, which is fine, but that is in addition to all this extra stuff.

At our Christmas Party, we were asked to bring an additional white elephant gift to the party separate from the Secret Santa exchange. These were not all just funny, jokey gifts, either. Senior staff (including me) are also expected to contribute to cash gifts for all the support staff and I still have to keep track of the individual gifting I need to do for my one direct report for birthday, Xmas, and nationally recognized days for her particular role. I am also expected to attend a second Xmas party for the cross-office team I am a part of, which will also involve a white elephant exchange and I have already been solicited for a gift for my boss from that team. 

The organization itself gives modest Xmas cash bonuses to all staff and they do office treats like pop-up mobile coffee bars, chair massages, etc...so I think overall the organization does a good job of acknowledging staff throughout the year and particularly at the holidays. I am just a little puzzled by the individual gifting expectations on top of this.

I feel like I have spent most of the fall and early winter shopping for our next office gifting event, not to mention it has pretty much thrown any concept of a holiday budget out the window for me and I haven't even finished shopping for my family yet. I am terrified of what Valentine's Day, Easter, and Memorial Day may bring. Yet, as a newer team member, I am also cognizant that if I set limits on this I may well get called the Grinch.

1pmkhvl,https://i.redd.it/iadivdill77g1.jpeg,"Mountain America Stadium- Tempe, AZ- Home of the Arizona State Sun Devils- Review down below!","Welcome back to another edition of “Chasing Stadiums with CollegeCultureSports”! If you are just joining us, my brother and I have been on a mission to capture the game day experience at every FBS stadium. Today brings us to our 10th stadium! Yay! Double digits! Our 10th stop on this journey to 136, brings us to Mountain America Stadium in Tempe, AZ. Home of the Arizona State Sun Devils. 

———————————————————————————

On Saturday, Sept. 13th, 2025, the day right after our visit to Tucson, we would be attending the Texas State at Arizona State game. An 8:30pm start, if I remember correctly. Our day begins at almost noon today, as we had been up the previous day for just over 24 hours. Some much needed rest was in order. We had some “breakfast” at the Airbnb with a cup of coffee and admired the view for a little bit. Then it was off to Tempe. 

———————————————————————————

We got into Tempe around 1ish, so we had a lot of time to kill. With that extra time, we explored the town and found ourselves the team store. I found my mini helmet, and Evan found a hat, but my goodness, this team store had so much to offer. I thought it was really cool that they had TVs with the day’s games, in pretty much every corner of the store. You never missed a moment while walking through there. Upstairs was a pizza place too, so you could grab a bite to eat while shopping. 

———————————————————————————

It was again in the 90s so we had to cool off in the car a few times. We were parked in a parking garage, pretty central to everything in town. Tempe is an easy place to walk around, and the town is pretty cool. 

———————————————————————————

For lunch, we decided on tacos from Rusty Tacos. The food was pretty good. Nothing special, but 2 tacos and some chips for $12, so a solid lunch meal for a nice cheap price. They also had some games on, which is a plus. We watched Villanova at Penn State while we ate. Next time we go, we’ve heard the Chuckbox is the spot to try. 

———————————————————————————

After lunch we just kept walking around. We found some tailgates put on by locals, but nothing too spectacular. From what it looked like, the tailgating was better at the parking garage across from the stadium. There was  also an outdoor tailgate in “The Mill District” (I think). Bars, tents, and TVs, lined the area, but drinks were expensive, so we didn’t stay long. To be completely honest, Tempe wasn’t really our vibe. I will say it’s a great college town, and the college vibe is there, but it didn’t feel game day oriented. It felt like this was just the normal vibe of Tempe, and partying isn’t really our thing. We’re kind of past that phase. 

———————————————————————————

As we continued walking, we just started heading in the direction of the stadium, and we came across the tailgate put on by the university. It was just like any other university tailgate, but given the vibe of Tempe being just parties, everyone was either pregaming at home or at the bars in downtown, so the atmosphere was a bit lackluster. Something I was disappointed about, given ASU was just off a playoff appearance. 

———————————————————————————

From the tailgate, we went to the stadium.

The stadium itself is really cool. Mountain America Stadium. Though named after a bank, it’s certainly fits the stadium location, as the stadium sits directly next to a mountain and even parts of it sit on top of it. Now, I do use the term mountain lightly, because where I’m from, that was just a really big hill, but still unique nonetheless. 

It is easy to navigate, and has your typical stadium look. Nothing that stood out to us like Arizona in the aspect of the structure, but still a really cool stadium. You have to walk up a decent flight of stairs when entering, but once you get to the top of the flight, the field emerges and it’s the first thing you see. Super cool, really gets you excited for the game you’re about to watch. 

Mountain America Stadium was built in 1958, and seats 53,599. It was home to the Fiesta Bowl from 1971-2006, the Cactus Bowl from 2006-2015, and the Arizona Cardinals from 1988-2005. 

———————————————————————————-

The Sun Devil theme is prevalent throughout the stadium which I love. I’ve always had a soft spot for Arizona State with that Sun Devil logo. However, I was severely disappointed in the atmosphere for a team that was just in the playoffs. First of all, the stadium didn’t sell out, which isn’t an issue, but when you don’t sell out the stadium, I would hope a majority of the stadium would stay to the end. This was not the case. 

Well what about the student section? They at least stayed and cheered on their team right? Right? Nope. The student section, known as, “The Inferno”, only burned their embers for about 30 minutes. By halftime it was practically cleared out. And it’s not like it was a major blowout either. Sun Devils led at halftime 20-3. 

———————————————————————————

The halftime entertainment was the band, and they played a few songs. Evan went down to the concessions to grab some waters. PSA: Water at Mountain America Stadium is $10 a pop. When it’s almost 100 degrees outside, you can view this two ways. A great marketing strategy, or just disrespectful. We viewed it as disrespectful. When it was below freezing at Air Force, Hot Coco was only $5 for a nice big cup. So to put a high price tag on something that will make or break my enjoyment there, seems disrespectful. 

———————————————————————————

The rest of the game was decent with an empty stadium cheering for every first down the Sun Devils got. 

The intro to the 4th quarter was ok. At least the stadium lights went down, and the hype video was cool, but nothing more than that. No real show or anything. With about 5 minutes left even more people cleared out, so when the game was over we had no issue getting out. The single upside of people leaving earlier. Arizona State got the win 34-15 over the Texas State Bobcats. 

———————————————————————————

As we left, we thanked the stadium and wandered, the long way, around Tempe to get back to the car. This seemed to be when the bars were popping, with lines stretched out the door to get into a lot of the places. Unfortunately for us, we had an early flight to catch in the morning, so we didn’t indulge, though I can confidently say it probably wouldn’t have been our scene. 

———————————————————————————

We made the drive back to Phoenix, got a few hours of sleep and then left for the airport to get home and prepare for our next week’s adventure in Oklahoma.

At first, I thought the grinder wasn't grinding correctly, so I added another shim that came with it. Currently, I'm noticing a finer grind. But today, after doing maintenance with Cafiza and Dezcaf, when I reassembled it, I noticed this spray pattern.

Is it normal for it to spray like this? Or should the spray pattern be evenly distributed?

Could the problem have been just the grinder? (I don't currently have any coffee beans to test)

I wanted to see if I could get an AI video model to make a super high-end, slow, satisfying coffee sequence without doing a full storyboard or edit myself.

So I treated it like a mini film brief and gave it **ONE** detailed prompt for a single shot/sequence:

    The Coffee Maker: ""The Ritual Architect"" (Refined Camera)
    Camera Movement: Precise static close-ups followed by a very slow, controlled slider push-in.
    Prompt:
    A series of precisely framed, static extreme close-up shots, each transitioning smoothly to the next:
    Static shot: Perfectly roasted coffee beans cascade into a grinder.
    Static shot: A pristine stream of water (lit from behind to appear golden) flowing into the reservoir.
    Static shot: A hand in a tailored sleeve precisely tamps the grounds, focusing on the texture.
    Static shot: The machine's digital interface glows, showing perfect pressure.
    The final shot begins as a static close-up on the portafilter, then executes a very slow, deliberate slider push-in as a velvet-smooth, dark stream of espresso pours into a pre-warmed, minimalist cup, followed by expertly frothed milk creating intricate latte art. The shot ends with steam rising perfectly, the camera holding perfectly still.
    Style: 4K, pristine studio lighting, ASMR-like sound design, hyper-clean aesthetic, sharp focus on liquid and steam textures, elegant, precise, satisfying, calming.

That was it, nothing else was needed to create this visual. 

If you want to reuse the idea for your own product, the pattern is simple:

* Pick a **ritual** (coffee, tea, skincare, cocktails, etc.)

* End with **one slow hero camera move** and a clean final frame

I’m calm, introspective, and perceptive. I’m not into swipe culture or surface-level connections. I’ve tried the apps and the usual “go out and be social,” but I keep running into the same patterns, and I’d rather build something intentional and consistent.

I recently read Daring Greatly and it gave me a profound moment of clarity about how guarded we can all become, including me. I’ve been practicing showing up more open in everyday life and I’d love to connect with people who appreciate that kind of sincerity.

“The willingness to show up changes us, it makes us a little braver each time.”

– Brené Brown

I’m drawn to simple things: walks by the river, coffee shops where you can actually sit and read, bookstores, low key exploring around town. I’m also someone who can be a little quiet at first, but I do well with genuine conversation once there’s a little comfort.

I’m looking to move slowly and get to know someone over time, with consistency, clear communication, and respect for boundaries. I’m open to friendship first, and if it naturally grows into more, great. If it stays friendship, great.

If this resonates, send me a message with a bit about you. What are you into lately, a book, a hobby, a place you like to go. If we click, we can start with something easy like a coffee or a walk somewhere public.",2,1765735130.0,DMVromance,0,1.0,False

The next, I'm wandering blindly in a valley of deep fog, where every decision feels like trying to navigate tangled underbrush with no compass.

This shifting landscape is a constant companion for me, like a long journey with an unpredictable GPS. There's a little journey I can share, just yesterday I had a day so productive, I managed to clean the entire house, create a painting that would usually take me weeks, and still had energy to burn. But today, getting out of bed was a monumental task, made a cup of coffee seems like climbing Everest.

Living with Bipolar2 is to simultaneously harbor both a charging bull and a gentle lamb within the self. It's bewildering, both are unique and day to day. I never know who would show up, the bull or the lamb. 

Do you feel like living with Bipolar2 is like residing in a constantly shifting terrain too? How do you navigate your days of extreme highs and lows?",2,1765735045.0,bipolar2,1,0.75,False
1pmkdnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pmkdnf/sp_everyone_has_one/,[SP] Everyone Has One,"He decides to take the test two years later, on his eighteenth birthday.

The rest of his year from school didn’t wait. He’s seen the notifications ping like popcorn. He hasn’t counted, but he doesn’t think there are many shadows amongst his former classmates.

Most present the result, proudly so. Some crow, slightly less.

Naked profiles are rare nowadays. It usually means one of two things: yet to take the test, or dominant criminality.

He balls his fist thinking about the possibility. The neighbour said that only two per cent of the population—globally—are so unlucky.

Major, minor or nebulous. He’d take any. His mother has a friend of a friend whose result came back straddling the latter two: *Public Toilet*. She still doesn’t know what to do with it, but the council will employ her for life.

When he arrives, the queue is quiet, only three people in front.

This used to be called a chemist, he read about it on his phone. The shelves are bare now; it’s the test centre.

Two teenage boys snicker and jostle as they approach the counter, their book bags swinging around their knees. They’ve come straight from school.

‘Shooters, or maybe like, making food, I dunno. What about you?’ one says to the other.

‘Something about space, innit.’

The first nods, a serious look on his face. He slaps the second on the back as the clerk waves them forward.

The other behind them is an old woman; it surprises him. The news says all the time that over ninety-seven per cent of adults over twenty have taken the test, citing the tax and pension benefits.

He’s not doing it for those.

The gibbering teens disappear behind one of the curtains into a cubicle, having paid with smart rings.

The old woman raises a hand, *surely not a ring,* and no, she drives it into her green corduroy trousers and pulls out a battered ten-pound note. The clerk handles it like a soiled rag and ushers her forward.

Before she ducks behind another curtain, to no one in particular, ‘I’m retired now. Husband thinks I may as well. What harm can it do?’

He’s next and the transaction is swift. The clerk mumbles that he can expect the result on his phone in minutes.

The cubicle is dour, with three paper-thin, wobbly walls and a recessed tablet stuck into a jutting shelf.

There are reams of terms and conditions to get through. He looks for the skip button, but it’s greyed out.

On page thirty-two of thirty-four he declines the short video on the history of the test. He doesn’t need to hear about deciphering junk epigenetic markers again.

People say they understand the test. They lie. All that matters is that people trust the result.

The government wants the result.

*‘Spit,’* comes the neutral voice from the tablet.

He hesitates.

*‘Spit, now,’* the tone insistent.

He gives it his best and covers the screen with as much saliva as he can muster. It’s absorbed by the membrane of the tablet and a big green tick appears.

The clerk grunts at him to vacate the cubicle, so he obliges and leaves the shop.

The temperature has dropped a few degrees; he shivers as he steps onto the street.

His phone buzzes in his pocket. He should look at the result.

But the smells of kebab and the noises from coffee shops distract him.

He decides to wait and look at his phone in the warm with a drink, but as he turns right, the old woman is standing alone.

An urge to procrastinate comes over him. He lets it. He starts a conversation.

‘Happy with yours?’

‘I gave my whole life to my business.’

She didn’t hear him; he asks again.

‘Mother. It came back with Mother.’

‘And is that . . . good?’ He tucks his hands into his jeans. The old woman doesn’t seem to feel the cold at all.

‘Mind your own business.’ As she walks past, he thinks she’s crying.

The coffee shop is quiet.

Like usual, he’s prompted to choose between test-accredited espresso or hobbyist. It’s a thirty per cent difference in price.

He opts for test-accredited in the spirit of things.

The phone rests on his thigh as he cups the tiny thimble of black liquid, trying to generate some sort of warmth, some sort of confidence.

‘How bad can it be?’ he says softly.

The worst, as it turns out.

His ears ring as his skull fills with pressure.

He wanted a purpose, a direction in life.

The word staring back at him is a hideous dead end.

*Murder.*

He downs the rest of his espresso. It’s still scalding hot; his eyes water.

Everyone has a talent. No matter how subtle, obscure or niche. It’s there.

The test will find a natural aptitude.

The rest is up to him.

 

*To be continued . . .*

1pmkcmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1pmkcmq/the_no1_productivity_expert_10000_hours_is_a_lie/,"The No.1 productivity expert: 10,000 hours is a lie! This science-based morning habit is ruining your day","You’ve probably heard some version of this already: “Wake up at 5 AM, meditate, drink lemon water, ice-cold shower, visualize success, don’t touch your phone for the first hour.” Sounds productive, right? Yeah, until half your day is wasted doing rituals you don’t need, based on advice that isn't even scientifically grounded. If you’ve ever tried to follow those perfect YouTube routines or TikTok productivity influencers, only to feel guilty, burned out, or worse, still unproductive, you’re not alone. 

Over the past few years, I’ve researched this stuff across behavioral science, productivity theory, and psychology. What I’ve found? Much of the morning routine hype is noise. The real problem isn’t whether you meditate or workout in the AM, it’s that you’re starting your day in reactive mode, hijacked by tasks that don’t build momentum. Also, the whole “10,000 hours to mastery” thing? Let’s just say even the researcher behind it said we got it wrong.

Let’s break down some brutal truths, smarter habits, and underrated tools that actually work. These are backed by science, not influencers cosplaying as life coaches.

- **The 10,000-hour rule is overhyped and misleading.** Originally popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in “Outliers,” the rule was based on research by Anders Ericsson. But Ericsson later clarified that it’s not just about putting in 10,000 hours and it’s about deliberate practice with feedback, coaching, and goal-directed effort. You could do 30,000 hours and still suck if you’re just going through the motions. (Source: Ericsson & Pool, Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise)

- **The worst morning habit? Starting your day with dopamine binging.** Checking TikTok, doomscrolling through news, or even overloading on ""motivation"" content can wreck your focus. Dr. Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist from Stanford, talks about how high dopamine hits first thing can make your brain chase unnecessary stimulation all day. Better move? Do something boring and meaningful instead like planning your priorities on paper. That’s what sets the tone.

- **Microwork > Long, forced sessions.** Research from the Draugiem Group through DeskTime shows your most productive window is about 52 minutes of focused work followed by 17 minutes of deliberate rest. Chunk your work into sprints and stop glorifying 8-hour grinds. It’s not the hours. It’s what you do with your mental energy.

- **Forget rigid habits, build “habit scaffolding.”** B.J. Fogg, author of “Tiny Habits,” explains that linking new behaviors to an existing habit (like brushing your teeth or making coffee) is far more effective than relying on willpower. You don’t need to overhaul your life. You need to tether new habits to your current one.

Some tools I wish I had known earlier:

- **Finch App** – A shamefully underrated self-care pet app that helps you set micro-goals in a non-intimidating way. It’s not just journaling; it subtly rewires your reward loop so habits stick without pressure. Your little bird grows as you grow. Weirdly soothing and way more effective than aggressive to-do list apps.

- **BeFreed** – It converts  books, interviews, and research papers into personalized audio podcasts and structured learning plans tailored to your goals. You can even choose the voice, depth, and tone of each episode whether it's a 10-minute summary or a 40-minute deep dive. The adaptive learning plan evolves with your progress and helps you internalize what you learn. Perfect for replacing social media time and staying sharp without burnout.

- **Insight Timer** – Free meditation app with thousands of audio guides, timers, and even talks from legit neuroscientists. What sets it apart? You can choose by goal: sleep, focus, anxiety. Also, no “subscribe NOW” traps like other apps. It’s the most flexible mindfulness tool I’ve used.

- **Notion templates from Thomas Frank** – He’s not just a YouTuber. His free Notion dashboards for habit tracking and goal setting are beautifully intuitive. It’s hard to fall off track when your system makes friction vanish. Google “Thomas Frank Notion template” and thank me later.

Now, the part you’ve been scrolling for: Book recs that’ll actually rewire your brain.

- **Stolen Focus by Johann Hari** – This book will make you question everything you think you know about attention. Hari dives into 12 deep causes of why we can’t focus anymore (hint: it’s not just our phones) and brings receipts from leading neuroscientists and policy experts. NYT bestseller. You’ll feel both angry and empowered after reading it. This is the best book I’ve read on productivity and modern distraction.

- **Deep Work by Cal Newport** – A productivity classic and for good reason. Newport, a professor at Georgetown, goes deep on why shallow tasks dominate most people’s days and how the real 1% focus comes from eliminating cognitive clutter. This book is the ultimate case for prioritizing focus over hacks.

- **Make Time by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky** – Made by two ex-Google designers, this book gives you 87 different tactics to reclaim your attention and energy. Super readable. Feels like talking to a friend who just gets it. This book will reset your relationship with time.

Podcasts worth your time:

- **The Tim Ferriss Show** – Cliché? Maybe. Useful? Hell yes. His breakdowns with high performers always include real tactics. For productivity, check out his episodes with Jim Collins and Greg McKeown.

- **The Huberman Lab Podcast** – If you geek out on neuroscience and want to understand how sleep, light, movement, and dopamine affect your output, this is your gold mine. Practical and science-backed.

- **The Mindset Mentor by Rob Dial** – One of the rare motivational pods that doesn’t feel like a guru yelling at you. Daily drops, under 20 minutes. Good for walking fuel when you need a head reset.

Small but powerful tactics I stole from real experts:

- **Start your day with “brain dumping.”** Before touching your phone, spend 3 minutes writing everything on your mind -tasks, worries, priorities. This turns anxiety into action and clears mental bandwidth.

- **Use “templated days.”** Naval Ravikant and Ali Abdaal both talk about the power of having default schedules. For example: Mondays = deep work, Fridays = admin. When you give days a theme, you lower decision fatigue.

- **Track dopamine, not time.** You’re not a robot. Log what actually energizes or drains you during the day. Over time, build a schedule around your best dopamine windows instead of forcing yourself into a “grind” shape.

Don’t get tricked by hacks that look pretty in reels but don’t work in reality. Being productive isn’t about how early you wake up or how many hours you log. It’s how you structure your day around energy, attention, and intention.

The best productivity system is the one that builds momentum, not guilt.

1pmkag6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1pmkag6/my_crush_blocked_me_on_instagram/,My Crush Blocked Me on Instagram,"I'm gay and earlier this year I began flirting with a guy who I know professionally but isn't a coworker. I didn't take it seriously until it became apparent he was flirting back. The flirting happened both in-person and through email and went on for a few months. 

My crush knows I'm gay but he's never told me if he's into guys; and he's a hard read. For those of you wondering, ""Well how do you know he isn't just being nice to you?"", it's because some of the things we've said to each other have indisputably crossed professional boundaries beyond the point of 'friendliness'. Even my therapist said, *""If a guy spoke to me the way he's been speaking to you, my husband would think I'm cheating.""*

Our mutual professional contacts have picked up on our interactions and have said he's clearly gone out of his way to express how much he likes me. People who work closely with him but who I don't know well have said he glows every time he talks to/about me. We have the type of professional relationship in which we could see/talk to each other all the time or none of the time.

At the beginning of the summer, he asked me out for coffee but never followed through when I told him a couple times to name the time and place. And then when I asked him out for coffee, he never responded. I also told him I had feelings for him but shortly after I lashed out and stopped talking to him for several months because I was ashamed of how I treated him.

As time went on, I began to miss him more and more. We hadn't seen each other or talked in months. A few weeks ago I sent him a lengthy apology email. I said things like *""there is a void in my life without you in it""* and told him how much I missed seeing and talking to him.

A few days later he warmly replied and asked if he could call me in a ""couple weeks"" when he returned to the country from his vacation. While he's a good guy and I'm not surprised he responded to me, he was under no obligation to do so; and he especially didn't have to respond as warm as he did. 

I gave him my phone number (again) and told him I had a crush on him. I said even if he wasn't into dudes/me, he needed to know how good our interactions earlier this year made me feel when it came to me struggling to lose weight and social awkwardness. I know he was on vacation but I couldn't wait to tell him because when I avoided doing so in the past, it made me frustrated that I took out on him. I didn't want to fall back into the same trap assuming we resumed regularly communicating. A couple days after I told him that I have a crush on him, he blocked me on Instagram.

I'm now within the few day window of ""a couple weeks"" for him to call me and the waiting is driving me mad.

I'm upset he blocked me on Instagram because it came as a surprise after I told him I have a crush on him and before we spoke on the phone. My initial thought was ""homophobe"" but it didn't take make sense based on the clearly flirtatious comments he made to me for several months earlier this year. 

Several people have suggested that he may be in the closet and that when we were simply flirting it was 'fun'. Yet by me being blunt about my feelings for him, it forces him to either explicitly acknowledge he's into dudes or stay in the closet; and both options are hard. They said blocking me on Instagram puts some distance between us while he comes to terms with his 'truth'. I'm in my 30s and came out when I was 13. He's a few years younger than me and while I know people come out in adulthood, I'm so secure and comfortable with my sexuality that him possibly being in the closet didn't occur to me.

When we regularly communicated, he often said and did 'different' things which I struggled to understand and in which people initially summed up as him also being socially awkward. Those things now make more sense if he's in the closet. 

While he doesn't owe me an explanation for blocking me on Instagram, it still hurts. Aside from getting to the bottom of flirting with each other, we've communicated well; I've never experienced chemistry with somebody like this before, either professionally or personally. He's 1 of the only people I feel I can be my authentic self around. He's told me how appreciative of how honest I've been with him about some of my personal struggles that have sometimes interfered with our interactions.

My close friends think the longer he goes without contacting me, the more likely he's struggling to come to terms with his 'truth'. Everybody is recommending I give him his space and they're confident that he'll contact me when he's ready. They've suggested if I don't hear from him in the next few days that I email him early next week to simply wish him a Merry Christmas. At this point, I'm leaning towards waiting until early in the New Year.

I want to be angry at him for blocking me and I go through hours-long stretches where I am angry and don't know whether I want to speak with him on the phone if he calls. But I also find it hard to be angry at him if he's struggling to come to terms with his ""truth"", not to mention how good he's made me feel when it comes to my self-esteem and confidence. 

At this point, all I can do is wait for him to contact me whenever that may be; but it sucks. I hope this waiting will be worth it!  


\------  
**TL;DR:** I'm in my 30s, there's a guy I know in person who I've been flirting with for months and whose been indisputably flirting back with me. He blocked me on Instagram after I told him I have feelings for him. People suspect he may be in the closet.",1,1765734806.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False
1pmk9km,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1pmk9km/method_from_family_embarrassment_to_the_success/,[METHOD] From family embarrassment to the “success story” in 60 days,"

I’m 24. For the past two years I’ve been the family member everyone talks about in hushed voices.

Dropped out of college halfway through junior year. Told everyone it was because I “needed to find my path” but really I just stopped going to classes and failed out. Wasted two years of tuition money and had nothing to show for it.

Moved back home with my parents at 22. Told them it would be temporary while I “figured things out.” Two years later I was still sleeping in my childhood bedroom playing the same video games I played in high school.

Got a job at Target stocking shelves overnight. Not because I wanted to work my way up or learn retail. Because it was the only job where I didn’t have to interact with people much and I could listen to podcasts while doing mindless work.

My younger brother graduated college last spring. Full ride scholarship, 3.9 GPA, job offer at a consulting firm before he even walked. Everyone celebrated him. I was there in the background, the cautionary tale. The example of what happens when you don’t apply yourself.

Family gatherings were torture. Aunts and uncles would ask what I was doing. “Still at Target” became my embarrassing answer. Could see the pity in their eyes. Could hear them later asking my parents in private “Is he doing okay? Have you thought about therapy for him?”

My dad stopped asking about my plans after the first year. Just accepted that I was going to be living in their house indefinitely. My mom would still try, suggest I look into online courses or trade schools. I’d say “yeah I’ll look into it” and never did.

The worst was seeing my old college friends’ social media. Everyone graduating, getting jobs, moving into apartments, starting lives. And I was still in my childhood bedroom working overnight at Target.

## The conversation that destroyed me

January 9th. Came home from my overnight shift at 7am. Parents were already up having coffee. Walked past the kitchen to go to bed.

Heard my dad say my name. Something made me stop outside the doorway.

Dad said “I don’t know what to do anymore. He’s 24 and he’s exactly where he was at 22. No progress. No goals. Nothing.”

Mom said something about being patient, that I’d figure it out eventually.

Dad got quiet then said “I think about his brother graduating, getting that job, moving out next month. And then I think about him. And I just feel like we failed him somehow. Or he’s given up completely. I don’t know which is worse.”

Mom started crying. She said “I miss who he used to be. He was so motivated in high school. Had so many plans. Now he just… exists. Goes to work, plays games, sleeps. That’s his entire life.”

Dad said “I’m scared he’s going to wake up at 30 and realize he wasted his twenties and hate himself. Or hate us for not pushing him harder.”

I stood there frozen in the hallway. Hearing my dad say he thinks they failed me. Hearing my mom cry about missing who I used to be. Realizing I’d become the biggest disappointment in their lives.

Went to my room and couldn’t sleep. Just laid there replaying that conversation. Realized my parents were embarrassed of me. Realized my brother probably pitied me. Realized I’d become exactly what I’d feared in college, a failure with no future.

That day I made a decision. I had 60 days until my 25th birthday. Two months to prove I wasn’t a lost cause. To prove to my parents, my brother, and myself that I wasn’t done.

## What I did (the uncomfortable part)

First thing I did was apologize to my parents. Told them I’d overheard their conversation. Said they were right about everything. My mom started apologizing and I stopped her. Said I needed to hear it.

Told them I was going to change things in the next two months. They nodded politely. Could tell they didn’t believe me. Didn’t blame them.

That night I applied to 30 jobs. Not Target level jobs. Real jobs. Office jobs, junior positions at tech companies, anything entry level that paid actual money. Didn’t care if I was “qualified.” Just applied.

Quit my Target job two days later. Gave them notice and walked out. Was terrified because I had no backup plan but knew I couldn’t change anything while working overnight shifts.

Deleted every game from my PC. League, Valorant, everything. Uninstalled Discord. If I was going to have time, I needed to fill it with something other than gaming.

Found this app called Reload on Reddit while searching “how to stop being a loser.” Creates structured 60 day plans based on where you are. Set it to block games and social media from 8am to 8pm. Gave me daily tasks: apply to 5 jobs, learn a skill for an hour, work out for 30 minutes.

Started teaching myself Excel and SQL using free YouTube tutorials. Every job posting mentioned them. Spent 2-3 hours daily just doing practice problems.

## Week 1-3: Rejection and doubt

First three weeks were brutal. Applied to probably 80 jobs total. Got rejected from 60 of them. The other 20 didn’t even respond.

Had one phone screening that went nowhere. Guy could tell I had no real experience and politely ended the call after 10 minutes.

My parents would ask how job hunting was going and I’d say “still applying” while dying inside. Could tell they thought this was just another phase. That I’d quit and go back to Target in a month.

Week 2 my brother came home for a weekend before starting his new job. We went to get food and he asked what I was doing. Told him I’d quit Target and was applying to real jobs.

He said “That’s good man. You’ve got potential, you just gotta use it.” Not condescending. Genuine. Made me want to prove him right even more.

Week 3 I got an interview for a junior data analyst role at a small marketing company. Studied for it like it was a final exam. Practiced SQL queries. Rehearsed answers. Went to the interview in a suit I borrowed from my dad.

Interview went okay. Not great, not terrible. They said they’d let me know in a week. Didn’t hear anything for 10 days. Then got an email offering me the position. Starting salary $48k. Three times what I was making at Target.

Called my parents immediately. My mom cried. My dad said “I’m proud of you son.” First time he’d said that in years.

## Week 4-6: Proving it wasn’t luck

Started the job week 4. First real office job of my life. Was terrified I’d fuck it up and prove everyone right that I was a failure.

Spent my first week just absorbing everything. Learning their systems, taking notes on everything, staying an hour late every day to make sure I understood.

Boss said most new hires take a month to get up to speed. Decided I’d do it in two weeks. Studied at home every night. Practiced SQL queries until I could write them in my sleep.

Week 5 I was assigned my first real project. Building a dashboard to track customer metrics. Spent three days on it. Redid it twice because I wasn’t satisfied. Presented it to my team.

Boss pulled me aside after and said “This is better than what some analysts with two years experience produce. How long did this take you?” Told him three days. He said “You’re going to do well here.”

Started going to the gym in the mornings before work. Figured if I was changing my life, might as well change everything. Went 5 times a week. Lost 15 pounds by week 6.

Started paying my parents rent. Wasn’t much, $400 a month. But wanted to contribute. Show them I was serious about being an adult.

Week 6 my brother came home again. Saw me in a button down getting ready for work. Said “Dude you look completely different. Like a different person.” Felt good hearing that.

## Week 7-9: Unrecognizable

Week 7 I got my first real paycheck. $1,600 after taxes every two weeks. Had never seen numbers like that in my account. Put $1,000 immediately into savings. Started looking at apartments.

Boss gave me more responsibility. Started leading parts of team meetings. Contributing ideas. Getting praise for my work. People respected me. Hadn’t felt that in years.

Week 8 I moved into my own apartment. Nothing fancy. Studio 20 minutes from my parents. But it was mine. My parents helped me move and my dad said “I never thought I’d see this day. I’m so glad I was wrong.”

My mom hugged me and said “I have my son back.” That hurt and felt good at the same time.

Week 9 was my 25th birthday. Parents threw a small dinner. My brother was there. A few family friends. Everyone kept saying how different I looked. How I seemed “lighter” somehow.

My aunt pulled me aside and said “Your parents talk about you all the time now. They’re so proud. I’m happy you turned things around.”

Realized that two months ago I was the family embarrassment. Now I was the comeback story.

## Where I am now (day 60)

I wake up at 6:30am for work. This was impossible two months ago when I was sleeping until 2pm.

I work a real job where people respect me and value my contributions. Making actual career progress instead of just collecting a paycheck.

I live in my own apartment that I pay for with my own money. No longer a 24 year old living with his parents.

I work out 5 times a week. Lost 17 pounds. Feel better physically than I have in years.

My relationship with my family is completely different. Parents are proud of me. Brother treats me like an equal instead of someone to feel sorry for. Go to family events without shame.

Most importantly, I’m not a disappointment anymore. I’m not a cautionary tale. I’m not the family failure. I’m proof that you can turn it around.

## What I learned

Your family doesn’t want to be disappointed in you. They want you to succeed. They’re just tired of watching you waste potential.

Rock bottom is a choice. I could’ve stayed at Target in my parents’ house forever. Lots of people do. You have to decide you’re done being there.

Two months is enough time to change the trajectory of your life if you actually commit. Not years. Months.

You don’t need perfect qualifications. You need to be willing to learn and work harder than everyone else. I had no experience and still got hired because I proved I’d outwork people who did.

The embarrassment of being a failure is worse than the discomfort of changing. Yeah changing was hard. But being the family disappointment was harder.

Physical changes reinforce mental changes. Started working out and it made me feel capable in other areas too.

## If you’re the family disappointment

Your family doesn’t hate you. They’re sad for you. They see potential you’re wasting and it breaks their hearts.

You’re not a lost cause. You’re just stuck. And stuck is fixable.

Pick a deadline. Mine was my 25th birthday. Yours can be anything. Give yourself 60-90 days to prove you’re not done.

Apply to jobs you don’t think you’re qualified for. Worst case they say no. Best case they give you a shot and you outwork everyone else.

Use tools like Reload to force structure. I needed my games and social media blocked or I would’ve just kept wasting time.

Start small. One job application. One workout. One skill learned. Stack those days and suddenly you’re unrecognizable.

Accept that your family is skeptical. Mine didn’t believe me either. Prove them wrong through action, not words.

## 60 days

60 days ago I was a 24 year old college dropout living with my parents working overnight at Target. My family was embarrassed of me. My brother pitied me. My parents thought they’d failed me.

Today I’m 25 with a real career, my own apartment, and a family that’s proud of me. Went from disappointment to comeback story.

Two months. That’s all it took.

Two months from now you could be someone your family brags about instead of whispers about. Or you could still be the disappointment, just older.

Your choice. Start today.

I’m rooting for you.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1765734746.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

**TL;DR:** Turn one habit into a 7‑day “Quest”: a clear objective, a <10‑min 3‑step ritual, simple XP points, and a tiny stake so skipping actually costs you something.

Discipline shouldn’t feel like punishment. It also shouldn’t depend on “having a good day” or feeling motivated.

You can turn **one habit into a 7‑day Quest tonight**: clear objective, tiny 3‑step ritual, XP system, and a small stake that makes skipping annoying.

**TL;DR:** Turn one habit into a 7‑day “Quest”: a clear objective, a <10‑min 3‑step ritual, simple XP points, and a tiny stake so skipping actually costs you something.

Most advice is: *“Just be consistent. Build routines. Try harder.”*  
But if starting is fuzzy, feedback is vague, and skipping is free, your brain picks the easy path:

* You overthink how to start.
* You don’t see progress, so motivation dies.
* You miss a day and… nothing happens. So missing again is easy.

I’ve been building a system that treats goals like small quests. The basic idea:

>

Here’s how to set up a **7‑day Quest** for one habit in under 10 minutes.

# Step 1: Pick one habit and write a measurable objective

For 7 days, you’re not “becoming productive.” You’re just running **one Quest**.

**Pick ONE high‑leverage habit**, e.g.:

* Writing
* Studying / deep work
* Exercise / walking
* Language practice

Then define the **per‑session objective**:

>

Examples:

* `Write 500 words.`
* `Study for 25 minutes with my phone in another room.`
* `Do 10 minutes of walking outside.`
* `Do 15 minutes of coding on project X.`

Make it **binary**: either you hit it, or you don’t. No vibes.

# Step 2: Build a <10‑minute 3‑step ritual that always runs first

Discipline breaks at the **start line**. So we script the start.

Your ritual should be:

* **Fixed**: same steps, same order.
* **Short**: under 10 minutes to get from “not working” to “in motion.”
* **Frictionless**: no decisions inside the ritual.

Template:

1. **Trigger (context)** “When it is **\[time\]** and I am in **\[place\]**, I will start my ritual.” Examples: `7:30am at my desk`, `8pm at the library`, `after lunch at the kitchen table`.
2. **Tiny opener (1–2 minutes)** Do something so small it’s hard to resist:
   * Open the doc/book/app.
   * Start a 60‑second timer.
   * Jot 1–3 bullet points of what you’ll do in this block.
3. **Main block + explicit exit**
   * Do your **focused work** for the agreed duration or until you hit the objective.
   * When done, **immediately log it** (more on XP next).

Example (my actual writing Quest):

1. Trigger: `Weekdays at 7:15am, at my desk, I put my phone in the other room.`
2. Tiny opener: `I open my writing doc, start a 2‑minute timer, and free‑write anything to warm up.`
3. Main block: `When the timer ends, I set a 20‑minute timer and write until I hit 500 words. Then I mark +1 XP in my log.`

Before this, I wrote 1–2 times a week, usually in big, exhausting bursts. With this ritual, I did **6/7 days** the first week and it felt weirdly automatic.

Common pitfall:

>

# Step 3: Define XP and a tiny stake

Your brain likes **game‑style feedback**: points, streaks, levels.

**XP rule (simple):**

* `+1 XP` for every session where you meet the objective.
* `0 XP` if you start but don’t reach it.
* (Optional) `-1 XP` if you skip a planned session without a real reason.

You can track XP anywhere:

* Paper with 7 boxes
* A note titled `7‑Day Quest: [Habit]`
* Calendar events like `Day 3 – +1 XP (3/5)`

**Levels (for fun):**

* Level 1 = 5 XP
* Level 2 = 10 XP Give yourself a small non‑food reward at each level (nice coffee, new playlist, 30 minutes guilt‑free gaming, etc.).

# Add a calibrated, low‑risk stake

Skipping needs to be **slightly painful**, but not scary enough to make you avoid the Quest entirely.

Examples of good stakes:

* **Accountability:** If you skip, you must message a friend:“I skipped my \[habit\] Quest today. Holding myself accountable.”
* **Annoying chore:** If you skip, you must clean one annoying area (sink, desk, inbox) *that day*.
* **Micro money:** If you skip, you send **$5** to a charity or cause you dislike.

Bad stakes:

* Huge money bets you’ll dread.
* Anything involving health risks, deprivation, or shame.

Rule of thumb:

>

# Step 4: Run a 7‑day experiment and count, not judge

For 7 days, your job is **not** to “be perfect.” It’s to **collect data**:

* How many sessions did you plan?
* How many did you complete?
* On which days did the ritual feel easy vs. hard?

After 7 days, look at raw counts:

* `Planned sessions: 7`
* `Completed: 5`
* `XP: 5`
* `Skips with stake paid: 2`

That’s already more information (and usually more output) than just “I’ll try to be more disciplined now.”

When I tested this with a small pilot group for writing and study habits, people reported:

* Fewer “I’ll start later” delays.
* More days where they did *something* even when tired.
* Easier restarts after a missed day because the ritual was scripted.

# Common pitfalls (and fixes)

1. **Ritual too complex**
   * Fix: Cut it to 3 deterministic steps. No decisions.
2. **Stakes too severe**
   * Fix: Scale them down until they’re just annoying, not scary.
3. **Vague feedback**
   * Fix: Log XP immediately after you finish. No “I’ll track it later.”

If you want a ready‑to‑use template, I put one in the first comment: **Quest name, objective, 3‑step ritual, XP rule, and stake.** You can literally fill in the blanks and be done in 5 minutes.

**What ONE habit are you going to turn into a 7‑day Quest, and when are you starting?**

# Comment prompt

What ONE habit are you going to turn into a 7‑day Quest, and when are you starting?

# First comment (post right after)

Here’s the promised **copy‑paste 7‑day Quest template** you can fill in in 5 minutes.

**7‑Day Quest Name:** `_____`

**Objective (per session):**  
`I will [do X] for [Y amount] in one focused block.`  
Examples:

* `Write 300 words.`
* `Study for 25 minutes (no phone).`
* `Walk 10 minutes outside.`

**Ritual (3 steps, <10 minutes to start):**  
*Run this script the same way every time.*

1. **Trigger (context):** `When it is [time] and I am in [place], I put my phone on Do Not Disturb and open [app/tool].`
2. **Tiny opener (1–2 minutes):** `I do a 60‑second countdown, then I write/type/list the first 1–3 things I’ll do in this block.`
3. **Main block + exit:** `I do my focused work for [X minutes or Y units]. When done, I immediately record XP and mark today as done/not done.`

**XP Rule:**

* `+1 XP for every completed session that meets the Objective.`
* `0 XP if I start but don’t meet the minimum Objective.`
* `-1 XP only if I skip entirely without a valid reason (e.g., illness, emergency).`

**Levels:**

* `Level 1 = 5 XP`
* `Level 2 = 10 XP`
* `(Optional) Small non‑food reward when you hit each Level.`

Track XP in anything simple:

* A paper grid of 7 boxes
* Notes app
* Calendar events named like: `Day 3 – +1 XP (7/7 total)`

**Stake (calibrated, low‑risk):**  
Pick **one**:

* `If I skip a planned session, I send $5 to a charity I dislike.`
* `If I skip, I must clean one annoying area (sink, desk, inbox) that day.`
* `If I skip, I must text a friend: “Skipped my Quest today, holding myself accountable.”`

Make it annoying, not devastating. The point is a **nudge**, not panic.

Asked for advice 6 months ago and got some great advice, so here I am again. Our budget was originally unrealistic so we pulled more money together.    
 Project 1 is a bathroom remodel with an addition. With your advice had plans drawn up, before contacting any GCs.  Called 2 local and one really large company.  

GC1 came out looked, measured, and we spoke for about 20 minutes. Took the plans and said give him a week to work out some rough numbers. Never heard back 

GC2 came out, looked measured, asked to sit down and look at the plans. Me the wife and him sat down talked pretty much about the whole scope of the project, over a cup of coffee.  This guy gave a great 1st impression. Left us with a list of recent jobs/referrals. Took a copy of the plans  Asked for 2 weeks for a estimate -  Never heard back 

large Company - Never came asked for plans to be emailed. Then they would have salesman call us. Would not give estimate unless wife and I were present for a presentation.   We passed.  

Kitchen remodel -  Just changing cabinets/floor, add exhaust fan.  Wife liked one particular kitchen company.  Went there, picked out cabinets, paid deposit for measurements. Been 2 weeks still waiting for call to come out measure.  Will call them tomorrow since they took a deposit.  

   Are we doing something wrong here? Just bad timing with holidays, is it the house itself, (built in 81 and never updated).  Should we call them and ask if they are still interested, or just move on and look for another 3.  Never experienced this before and unsure what to do.  Any advice or questions feel free.   Thanks so much for your time.

We set up some boundaries when we first moved in as his dad, uncle and step mom would show up here drunk n keep drinking. ( well not the step mom she stays sober.)
I have anxiety, panic attacks when stressed and have a learning disability. 
At around 8:40 him and I got into an argument and I went to the basement where my room is. 

We have a few house rules/ boundaries 
1. We tell each other when we have company coming over 
2. No one past midnight 
3. Not to much alcohol in the house 

At 9:00 pm his dad shows up with his step mom, un announced after my roommate and I had the argument and my anxiety was up. I was upset he didnt tell me. 
I left and went to get myself a coffee and came back to our house. (Renting)
He stands there and is trying to give me money and I said no thank you and went to the basement as now im worked up again after cooling off. 

He came down to apologize as I did snap a bit at him and his family. He apologized for not telling me and for trying to push the gift from his parents on me while he knew he should have waited. I went up and apologize to his family and thanked them for the gift.

At 12 pm I messaged him to send them home. 
He agreed. 
1 pm I asked again 
Then I started to spam him begging him to make them leave as I need sleep, I can't sleep when people are over and I have already had 1 anxiety attack because of people showing up un announced. 
He read the messages and ignored them 
I kept messaging him begging, pleading, and then full out flipping ( around 2:30) as I was literally going into another anxiety attack. ( he knows all about them)
His parents finally leave 10 minutes to 3am.
He comes down and sees im crying while rocking my nody to try to calm myself down from a panic attack or anxiety attack, while im texting one of my neat friends. 

He asked why im crying, I can tell he has been drinking, I snap and told him how he broke the boundaries/ house rules. That i begged him to make them leave. 
He argued that they are family, I said we agreed family is in those rules. 
He got upset and told me to ""stop faking panic attacks"" and something else I don't remember.

I let him cool off and went to try to talk to him. He does not see anything wrong. 
When I was in the middle of the panic attack I texted begging him to make them leave over 150 times, and telling him I can't do this anymore and that I want to move out and a few other things. 

He now saying I can get what I want and move out. I have the wifi and electricity under my name. I told him im not moving out and my stuff will be finished moved into the basement tomorrow when my girls show up. ( there is a bathroom in the basement as well) 

He is upset and does not want to talk to me know he says i get what I want. 
I told him what I want is for the boundaries to he upheld by BOTH parties like we agreed upon.
He said no you're just crazy and want control now get out of my face. 
He is now laying upstairs on my couch, while he watches TV drunk.

I told him his parents are no longer welcomed here 
There will be no Christmas gathering 
And that my friends will be here tomorrow.

He thinks I fake my anxiety, depression and panic attacks.
He wants me to respect his boundaries but won't respect mine.

1pmjytk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1pmjytk/oven_brisket_strategy/,Oven Brisket Strategy,"I'm cooking a brisket (oven / braised not a smoked bbq style) and I'm still trying to perfect my technique and looking for opinions!

My usual technique is a simple dry rub (salt / pepper / garlic powder), then a family sauce as the liquid (a classic ""grandmas sauce"" that includes mustard, ketchup, Worcestershire, cider vinegar, spices, sugar, instant coffee powder) - cover it all and put it in the oven at 250 and let it go until I get to about 200 intennal and then let it rest for as long as I can before it's time to eat.

It's usually turns out well, but I don't think I've yet perfected the technique so I'm trying a few tweaks:
- prime brisket from Costco rather than choice
- overnight uncovered in the fridge with a mild S&P dry brine

On the cook side, I'm wondering if I should try and add a bit of a sear in the end? I.e., pull it out at 190 or 195, pour off the juices for the sauce, then put it back in the oven at 450 for 5 (10?) mins, dry and uncovered to get a bit of color on it, before going to the final rest and slice. Would that add some flavor? Or is that more likely to dry it too much with the heat and without the liquid?

[Link to PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1plc6ht/no_end_penpal_is_getting_better_at_the_killer_in/)  
With the introduction of this new ""for stories"" sub I am once again posting this story (this time I added a picture to go with it!)  
This story was made to be just a bunch of references to stories covered on CreepCast. I originally posted this story about a year and a half ago right after the Tommy Taffy story. Back then I just tilted it ""Fan Made Story"" I gave it a better name this time around. I've since made some edits/updates, hopefully making it better. Please note that this story only purposefully contains references to stories they covered from Tommy Taffy and before, anything else is coincidence (the Candle cove reference is there because I like Candle Cove. They hadn't covered it when I made the story). Have fun finding all of the references!  
Also I have a prequel in the works focusing more on the dad and events that happened before his kids were born, with Borrasca V being the main foundation. Look out for ""My Wife Peeking at Me from the Church in Camp Deepwoods is going to far V""

“Who are you!” The man yelled, “What are you doing in this house?!”

Troy put his hands up, “Calm down it’s alright. This is my family’s house. I’m just living here for a bit.”

“Your family’s house?” The man seemed to calm down a bit, “you know Alice?”

“Yes! Yes. Alice is my sister. My big sister.”

The man put his gun down. “Are you Troy?”

“Yeah, did you know my sister?”

“Yeah. She was my girlfriend”.

Troy was surprised; his sister never mentioned a boyfriend to him.

“I’m sorry. It’s just with what happened. I noticed people here and thought they might know something. Sorry, sorry, I’m Nathan. I dated Alice while she lived here”.

“Nathan, OK, do you want to talk inside?” Troy asked.

“S-sure, if you don’t mind”.

Troy shows Nathan to the living room. Keith looking at them with wide eyes that said, “Why are you bringing the guy who was pointing a gun at you into the house?”

They sat down; Nathan laid his gun against the chair next to him.

 “So,” Troy said amongst the awkward atmosphere, “you were my sister’s boyfriend?”

“Yeah, we started dating a few months after she moved here”.

“Do you have any clue on what could have happened to her?”

“Not really, I don’t know. She was investigating this weird creepy game from the web at the time, so I thought that maybe the game had something to do with it, but it led nowhere.”

“What game?” Troy interrupted.

“Just this driving game, but they found her car so that couldn’t have anything to do with it. What I’m really worried about is that, well, I’ve been getting messages.”

“She’s been messaging you!” Troy yelled.

“That’s just it, it’s from her facebook account, but I don’t think it’s her.”

“What do you mean?”

“Well, here,” Nathan pulled up his phone and opened the messenger app.

The messages were full of weird texts. A bunch of incomplete sentences that didn’t follow any flow of conversation.

“I think it’s connected to something she was dealing with earlier. Did she tell you anything about that thing in the basement copying people she knows?” Nathan asked.

“Not directly, we didn’t talk much after she left home, but I read about it from her twitter.” Troy said.

“Wait,” Keith interjected, “there is a basement?”

“Yeah, she only ever heard whatever it was, never saw it. Even when we went down to look for them. She had my dad and I board it up.”

“Where is it? Where’s the basement door?” Keith seemed to be getting frantic.

“It’s over there,” Nathan pointed the to the span of wall between the kitchen and hall, “we even put some sound proofing to stop any voices from coming through.”

“Do you think that whatever that was is copying Alice now?” Troy asked.

“I don’t know, but I can’t rule it out”.

Troy and Keith looked at the short span of wall, thinking of what to do next with it.

“What’s that?” Nathan asked, pointing to the postcard left on the coffee table.

“Oh, just another mystery,” Keith responded, “An old creepy TV show asked kids to send postcards to that place, but it’s just an old house.”

“Oh yeah, I know this place. Old Mr. Weller’s place”.

“That’s what the creepy dude at the gas station said. Do you know anything about it? Is there anything to do with Alice?”

“Well, Alice did stop by there the week before she went missing. She wanted to talk to Mr. Weller about something she was investigating. I don’t know if it was that car game or not. She said he didn’t answer the door”.

“Well,” Troy spoke up, “maybe it’s all connected. The house, my sister, the guy in the basement…”

“Please,” Keith protested, “I don’t need to be thinking there is a guy in the basement.”

“I think we should take a look in the basement,” Troy proposed.

“I think we should leave it be” Keith shot back.

“You know,” Nathan responded, “we never did look in the basement after Alice went missing. We didn’t think anyone could get in, but if there is another entrance, then maybe… I agree, we should look down there”.

Keith was dejected, “Fine we’ll look in the basement, but I ain’t going down there without a gun”.

“We’ll need to tear down the wall too,” Troy said, “Lets meet back up tomorrow morning. We’ll get tools and guns ready and see what we can find”.

The other two silently agreed. Nathan left, and the other two spent the rest of the day looking for tools they could use to break the wall. They didn’t get as much sleep as they wanted that night.

Nathan returned the next morning, his own tools in hand. They spent an hour breaking the wall down until they were able to open the door.

“OK, we ready?” Troy asked.

Nathan held his shotgun. Keith had a rifle. They nodded in agreement. Troy’s own pistol was in its holster on his hip.

“Alright,” Troy said as he reached for the door.

He grabbed the doorknob then pressed his other hand on the door. He pulled the door against his hand to prevent it from making any noise and started to turn the knob. Troy was slow, so as to not have the doorknob make a squeak or rattle. Once the doorknob had been fully turned Troy whispered, “ready?”

The other two held their guns up. Troy quickly flung open the door, revealing a staircase descending into darkness. Dust, blown by the opening door, made a cloud. A simple light on a cord swayed. At the bottom a few stray objects could be made out on a cement floor.

The three began to head down. Nathan first, then Keith, and Troy last. At the bottom of the stairs Nathan turned left and flipped the light switch, turning on a light.

“Hey Nathan,” Keith asked, “did you ever find any sign of a person being down here before?”

“No, whenever we looked, we couldn’t even find a sign of anything being touched”.

The trio stuck close to each other as they explored the basement. It was one large room with a few columns and random walls. It smelt of dust, dirt, and damp wood. Not a single object was free of dust. There were shelves that held old tools, electrical supplies, jars, old peanut butter containers filled with random screws and nails, and random knickknacks. After spending half an hour looking around and finding no one they decided to look around for anything that could be a clue.

“Anyone find anything?” Troy asked the group after some time.

“I found some big metal letters,” Nathan said, “two A’s, four E’s, two P’s, and one L, W, D, H, T, C, and R”.

“Weird, Keith what about you?”

“I got some weird video tapes. This one says Squidward's Suicide, and this one says Normal Porn for Normal People tape 1. Oh, and some bootleg of Zelda Majora's Mask,” Keith said, “what have you found?”

“Nothing really, this shelf is a little wiggly,” Troy wiggled the shelf to show this, causing it to fall over in a crash. “Whoops”.

“Great goi–,” Keith stopped mid-sentence looking at what the now uncovered wall revealed, “is that a door?”

There was a door painted red. Written on the door was a number 1.

“Did you ever find this before Nathan?” Troy asked.

“No, I’ve never seen it before. Maybe we should tell the cops. It could help with the investigation”.

“Right, let’s do that,” Keith agreed, “I do not want to go in there myself. Who knows what’s in there”.

The three went back upstairs and reported what they found to the police.

“They said they are going to send someone over to talk to us,” Nathan recounted.

“I guess they would want to check it out,” Troy said.

“Well, if they don’t show by sunset, we’re nailing that door shut,” Keith interjected.

They decided to eat while they waited for them to arrive. About half an hour later there was a knock at the door. Upon opening the door, they saw a man facing away, wearing a long trench coat and a fedora. The man turned around to his right, taking is hat off.

“Hello, I’m Markus. I came here about the door you found”.

 

They allowed Markus to enter and ushered him to take a seat in the living room.

“I don’t recognize you as one of the police officers that helped before,” Nathan mentioned.

“I’m part of a special division. For when things get a bit too… unusual, for the regular police. I was on a bit of a dead end with this case for a while, so your discovery has me intrigued”.

Keith went to Nathan to quietly ask him, “did you ever tell them about your facebook messages?”

“It just started so I never did. I should do that,” Nathan walked up to Markus pulling out his phone. “Um, I don’t know if this will help you, but I’ve been getting some messages from Alice’s facebook”.

Nathan showed Markus the messages in his phone. Markus took his phone and read through them, taking his time. “Are these time stamps correct, or do they not match up with real time?”

“I think the times are correct”.

“I see, I was worried about this”.

“Worried about what?” Troy asked.

“Can I ask your connections to all this,” Markus asked both Troy and Keith.

“I’m Alice’s younger brother”.

“I’m just Troy’s friend since, forever”.

“We’re living here while we go to college”.

“I see,” Markus seemed to consider this, “I suppose you know the main details of the case, so I’ll catch you up on the other details. This may be new to you too, Nathan. It seems to me that what we have here is a type of mimic”.

“Yeah,” Troy said, “it was mimicking people, and I guess mimicking her too”.

“It’s more than that,” Markus rebutted, “mimics like this spread. They torture their victims until they can get rid of them and take their place. They will then help other mimics to get more victims. Or even take more themselves. If my hunch is right, this door may lead to a nest of some kind”.

“So, are you going to go in guns blazing?” Keith asked.

“Guns blazing isn’t the best, but no need to worry”, Markus smiled, “I think we, can get to the bottom of this”.

“Wait, we?” Keith gestured to Troy Nathan and himself. “You want us, to go too?”

“I think you all got what it takes for this. Also my department doesn’t have that many people in it, and I could use some help”.

“Oh god,” Keith signed disappointedly.

“Why don’t you show me the door you found”.

They turned left and descended the stairs. They pointed to the small door with a “1” on it.

“There it is,” Troy said, “We haven’t opened it or anything”.

“Alright, let’s see what’s in here,” Markus said heading to the door.

Markus grabbed the door handle and slowly turned it, struggling slightly as it stuck at a few points. He pulled at the door, having to put more force than he was expecting. Once it passed the frame, the door swung freely. What was exposed was a long tunnel lit by intermittent bulbs hanging from the ceiling. The walls were lined with metal sheeting, like the roofing on farms.

“Ok, you guys ready,” Markus looked to the three others.

The three of them held up their guns. “We’re good to go,” Troy said.

“Alright,” Markus pulled out a flashlight and headed in first.

Nathan went in next, followed by Keith and then Troy. The tunnel was crooked, and the ceilings lowered and rose. They almost had to crawl in some places.

“So, Troy. How was your relationship with Alice?” Nathan prodded, “the things she told me about you were kind of spotty”.

“Well, I always liked her, but I did get the feeling that she didn’t really pay attention to me much,” Troy answered.

“How so?”

“Sometimes she just didn’t remember things we did or said to each other. Honestly, I think she was like that with a lot of things.”

“I can understand. She does seem forgetful to me too. She wrote a lot of reminders down”.

Eventually on a right turn they came across another door. It was painted red with a 2 on it.

“Everyone on their guard,” Markus told the others as he reached for the door.

He slowly opened it. Inside was a room that looked like a control room from the 50s. Dirt and grime covered the computers and keyboards. Large blank monitors lined what appeared to be the front of the room.

The group spread out around the room to investigate. Troy went over the buttons. Keith looked at the labels on the computers. Markus looked for spots where something could be hidden. Nathan shuffled through some filing cabinets.

“All of these documents are in Russian,” Nathan said, “Could this be that testing sight from that urban legend?”

“OK, you’re going to have to tell the newbies here about the town lore. What urban legend?” Keith asked.

“There was talk about how the US government used captured Russian scientists to do experiments on other prisoners out here in the woods. I think back in the cold war. I guess it was true.”

Markus took a look at the papers Nathan had found. “I know a bit of Russian.” He gave them a quick glance, “These papers are saying something to effect of keeping people awake to see what happens. It looks like something changed about the people being tested. Not sure what though.”

“This door over here has a 3 on it,” Troy called out.

“Looks like that’s our next stop,” Markus said.

They opened the door to a large open room. The walls and floor are made of cement. On the left wall was a large door that looked like it was for a large safe. Painted on the front of it, is the number 4. The door was wide open, reviling a room with tiled walls and shower heads along them. There are a few old beds frames left in the room.

“Guess this is where the sleep experiments happened,” Nathan said.

Keith noticed another more regular door in the room with a 5 on it.

“Well, I’m not going in the shower room, so lets just keep moving,” Keith said.

No one seemed to want to enter room number 4. In agreement they went to the next door and opened it.

On the other side was a cave. Light was coming from the ceiling of the cave that drew their attention to a staircase in perfect condition to their right.

“A weird place for stairs like this,” Nathan mentioned, “actually, they don’t even look like they’d take us to the top. They’re just a random staircase in a cave leading nowhere”. Nathan walked up to the stairs.

“Wait!” Troy yelled, “never touch random stairs like that”.

“He’s right,” Markus said, “I’ve gone over a lot of reports in this area from the Forest Rangers. They find these stairs all the time in the woods. Nothing good happens when you touch them. So Troy, you have some knowledge on this”.

“It’s just something my dad always said,” Troy brushed off Markus’s comment.

“Let’s find a way out,” Markus said.

The group, sticking close to each other, begin to search the cave.

“I think the area around here can be climbed pretty easily,” Keith said pointing out the wall leading up to the hole in the ceiling.

The way up was easy. It almost seemed like a tight walking path up, with them only having to grab the wall a few times. Climbing out of the cave took them to a forest. Looking around they saw a house with a silo near it to their left, not too far away.

“Is that the house I think it is?” Troy asked.

“What other house would it be?” Keith chided, “There is only one house it could be”.

They walked up to the house. As they got closer, they could see it was the back of the house. On the back door they saw a number hanging.

“Well maybe it’s not the same house,” Troy pondered, “It’s got a 6 on it not a 9 like we saw earlier”.

“Troy you idiot,” exasperated Keith as he rotated the 6 on the door, “it’s not a 6 it’s a 9 that fell”.

As Keith’s hand left the door, it slowly creaked open a crack.

“Oh no,” Keith sighed, “We’re not going in are we”.

“It’s what everything has been leading to,” Troy said.

“Oh shut up, don’t be so dramatic,” Keith huffed.

Pushing the door open, they all enter the house. The inside was old and unkept. The smell of mothballs permeated the air. The house creaked as wind pushed on it. It almost sounded like someone walking right above them. They saw no sign of life as they entered the kitchen and dining room area. They heard a noise to the right, coming from down a hall, that sounded like something more than the house settling. Silently they all looked at each other, confirming their next action. Readying their guns, they stalked down the hall.

In the middle of the living room stood a man facing away from them. He seemed to notice them entering.

“Hi!” The Man said without turning around.

“Are you Mr. Weller?” Kieth asked.

“I can be,” the Man responded.

The Man turned around. He wore a white shirt that said “Hi” on it. He had blond hair that was slicked back. His face seemed almost plastic like with an unnatural smile stuck on it.

A shot rang out as a hole appeared in the Man’s head. The Man fell to his back with a thud. Keith’s rifle had a bit of smoke coming from the barrel. The others looked at Keith.

“He spooked me,” Keith defended himself.

“Sorry I wasn’t expecting guests today.” The Man said, “I didn’t really have anything prepared for you”.

The others snapped back to the Man as he stood back up.

“You guy’s seem stressed,” he said, “you want to talk about feelings?”

“My sister, Alice, you did something to her. Didn’t you,” Troy yelled.

“It’s not nice to go around accusing people of things,” the Man responded.

“What are you?” Markus interrupted.

“Me? Just me?” the Man teased.

“Yeah, there are more of you, aren’t there,” Markus said, “why don’t you explain yourselves”.

“We just want to do our best at being human,” the Man said, “Perhaps you can help. Would you mind showing us how to act. Telling us what to say. Screaming us what to yell”. The smile on his face somehow seemed to widen.

The sound of scratches started to emanate from beneath the floor. Hundreds of hands scratching the ceiling of the basement below. The floor itself began to vibrate. The Man began to laugh.

A door opened and a gaunt humanoid creature walked out. It’s flesh gray, stands of hair were in random spots on its head. Its eyes sunken in and mouth full of small razor-sharp teeth. Its hands had long claws on them.

“Stop, stop,” the creature said in a strangely feminine voice.

“What, why? What’s up?” the Man responded.

“I know them. Well, some of them”.

The group of four stood there silently, shocked at the situation.

“Sorry about this. It’s me, Alice,” the creature said.

“Bullshit!” Nathan yelled, “you’re the ‘thing in the basement’ that can just copy people! You’re the thing contacting me on facebook with those weird messages!”

“OK, I did try to message you on facebook, but the reception here is crap. I wasn’t in the basement, that was some of these other guys. And, I guess I’m not the only Alice. You see Alice and I are twins. We’ve been swapping places occasionally,” the creature named Alice explained.

“What? No! How?” Troy asked.

“Oh, right. Let me show you,” the creature named Alice began shift and bulge. Its bones rearranged, skin changed color, and hair grew out. At the end of it, the creature looked identical to what Alice did. “There we go”.

“And you’ve been swapping places with Alice? For how long?” Troy asked.

“As long as I can remember. You know how mom and dad are divorced? We’d take turns at mom’s place. I got to go to your even numbered birthdays. Before that I would just hang out under the house most the time”.

“Well, why keep it a secret from me?”

“Dad,” Troy and the creature named Alice said in unison.

“Well, where is the ‘other Alice’ then?” Nathan angrily asked.

“Yeah!” Troy agreed.

“Alice ran into some trouble when she was investigating that internet game. She happened to run across some human trafficking, when looking into disappearances and places they’ve gone. She had to go into witness protection, and because I’m also Alice, I had to hide too. So I chose hide out here. I’m just guessing, dad didn’t tell you anything about this did he?”

“I’m going to give dad a call real quick,” Troy said.

“What I want to know is,” Markus spoke up, “you said you’re Alice’s twin. Alice is a normal human right?”

“Yeah, she’s normal,” and the creature named Alice agreed.

“Do you know why one of you is normal and the other is a mimic?” Markus questioned.

“I don’t, I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember. My parents tried to get me to live like a normal human, but I had trouble saying in human form when I was young”.

“If I may,” the Man interjected, “we’re not sure if she when through something like what we did. We were experimented on and became like this. Her on the other hand, maybe the being a twin had something to do with it”.

“The guys in the basement?” Markus asked.

“Oh, don’t worry we just wanted to scare you off, maybe cause some memory loss in the process. Only to keep ourselves safe”.

“Well, fuck,” Troy said, “my dad just confirmed all this. The shapeshifting twin, the swapping, that witness protection. He doesn’t remember where Alice is though. Typical”.

“OK,” Keith said, “just to make sure everything is cleared up, if it’s all true. I don’t 100% trust your dad”.

“Fair,” Troy nodded.

“But you said it wasn’t you, ‘Alice’, who was scaring Alice number one from the basement. Could you explain that?”

“Right, that was some of these guys,” the creature named Alice pointed at the Man and towards the basement.

“You see,” the Man interjected, “some of the others wanted to practice their mimicking abilities. We are still trying to be more human like. So they went through that passage in the basement to see how convincing their voices were”.

“We only discovered what was really going on when Alice came here to talk to Mr. Weller,” the creature named Alice recounted.

“Alright, is there anything else we need explained?” Keith asked the group, “Anyone have anything to add on here? Creepy guy, Alice monster, one of us for some reason?”

Everyone in the room shook their heads.

Markus took Troy to the side. “What do you think about all this? Do you really think they’re trustworthy?”

“I think I’m at least 75% convinced,” Troy whispered, “but I think I still want to find the normal Alice. I won’t buy everything unless I hear it from her”.

“Well, witness protection isn’t something the police can help with. That’s a U.S. Marshals thing. So, finding her won’t be easy”.

“I’ll figure something out”.

“You guys want to meet the others?” the Man excitably asked.

“No!” The others said in unison.

After things calmed down, the four boys left the house. Taking a taxi back to Troy and Keith’s place. They exchanged contact information. Markus and Nathan left soon after.

“Well, that all happened,” Keith said.

“Yep,” Troy responded.

Troy laid down on the couch staring up at the ceiling going over his life and all the things kept from him, and the new things he learned that he would now have to add in as well. And he wondered how he was going to find his sister.

1pmjxal,https://i.redd.it/zsrgprqhh77g1.jpeg,Is it only me or has there been a surge in homeless/mentally ill people in the railway stations post Covid?,"Been traveling since the early 2000s, there used to be a time when you wait with your family in the railway station platforms and have a nice time before boarding the train. However post Covid, I've felt like there's been an increase in creepy Homeless or mentally ill people on the platforms. I travel twice a month so that's 4 station visits a month, and almost 80% (yes it's shocking but a totally honest number) of the time I've bumped into such creeps. One time it was this weird dude who had coffee on his hand and he was pouring it on to the platform and observing it very closely, just pouring hot coffee on the platform and looking at it pouring down with a wide grin. Then there was this dude who would go around and be strange around people, pulling their ears, hands, shirts etc. and grinning at them, another one that'd incoherently yap and follow you (I'm a fully grown man btw), one that was talking to himself suddenly got violent and started attacking people around and this weird guy who had his pants low and staring into infinity, expressionless. It's saddening cuz we all know what the trains have come to, now we can't have our kids around without accommodating them in paid AC waiting rooms or longue.

by Stephen L. Harrison  
  
They asked their lovers a child’s question:  
“Have you any scars?”  
  
One woman said, “No.”  
He was gone before her breath came back.  
  
One man said, “None worth mentioning.”  
She left him mid-smile,  
the answer still hanging in the air.  
  
Friends filled the gap with easy phrases—  
that’s how it goes,  
people move on,  
the room finds a new pair of shoulders.  
  
But under all that shrugging logic  
something truer kept staring:  
those who call themselves untouched  
have already cut the oldest thread.  
  
Later, in a coffee shop soaked with quiet music,  
a woman walked in with a steady grace,  
the sort that hides small fractures  
behind confident eyes.  
  
She sat beside me.  
We talked.  
Her story unravelled with the rising steam—  
a lover gone without reason,  
a silence that lived inside her like cold ash.  
  
By the third latte her voice thinned,  
hands restless on the cup’s warm rim.  
Then, almost in prayer, she looked at me.  
  
“Make me understand.”  
  
Not a demand.  
A surrender.  
  
So I told her of things  
rarely spoken outside dreams—  
of the way souls pass through one another  
long before they meet in waking life,  
of mothers who wait beyond the veil  
still tethered to us by a law older than breath.  
  
I said each of us carries a mark  
so ancient we forget it is a scar—  
a closed mouth of skin  
where we were once fed  
by the body that sheltered us.  
  
A silent circle.  
A zero that became our beginning.  
The infinity scar.  
  
Not a wound,  
but the memory of a doorway—  
the place where we were first known,  
first held,  
first loved.  
  
Her hand drifted to her abdomen  
as though an old voice beneath her ribs  
had whispered her name.  
  
She did not speak again.  
Some truths do not shape themselves into words;  
they bloom inside the body  
and wait.  
  
Later, under a sky spilling stars like sparks from a cosmic forge,  
I lay in a field alone.  
The earth steadied me.  
The night pulled at me.  
  
My shirt rose with the wind,  
and my navel faced heaven—  
the infinity scar open to the dark,  
as though offering itself back  
to the web of mothers and children  
stretching through all time.  
  
I felt it then—  
the soft tug between worlds,  
gravity lifting from below,  
ancestry humming from above.  
  
Every mother  
who cupped a child to her breast.  
Every child  
who ever pressed an ear to a heartbeat  
and learned the first definition of home.  
  
The stars glittered like the pupils of the past.  
Constellations leaned closer, listening.  
  
And I understood—  
not with mind,  
but marrow—  
that none of us are unthreaded.  
Ever.  
  
The scar remembers.  
The scar calls.  
The scar is the tether and the tender,  
the portal and the promise,  
the smallest shrine we carry  
to all who carried us.  
  
I lay naked as truth in the grass,  
the sky pulling through that quiet circle of flesh—  
the mark of origin,  
the wound that loved us into being,  
the infinity we will never lose,  
not in life,  
not in death,  
not in whatever waits beyond.",1,1765733734.0,PoetryWritingClub,1,1.0,False
1pmjud4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1pmjud4/2025_the_worst_year_of_my_life_85_year/,2025 - The worst year of my life. 8.5 year relationship -> 6 months PWBPD Relationship.,"Hi, all. 

  
Firstly. I thought this was a support group, but I find that there are a lot of threads here that seem to just be about hating on people with BPD. The toxicity from outside seems to have infiltrated to some degree. Just an observation...

Sorry this is so haphazard and long winded. I just need to get a lot of this off of my chest.

tl;dr - Broke up with ex of 8.5 years. Started dating pwbpd for 6 months. We now live together ,but are also broken up. True closure does not exist for me.

  
Anyways. I was in a ""normal"" relationship for 8.5 years. Things were going downhill for \~2 years, but there was still plenty of love there. There were just some irreconcilable (or what felt like) issues at the time. We will call her GF A

GF A and I broke things off, but still lived together as we shared everything - finances etc. We are in the process of paying down debt even though we have been apart for some while now and there have been no issues. 

  
I started dating someone new who eventually told me she had BPD. This scared me as I wasn't sure what BPD was and had only heard the name. I did some initial research and don't remember finding anything particular damning, but I guess I didn't read deep enough. She explained some of her issues to me and said that she used to be really bad off, but was really well regulated at the moment. She seemed to be doing extremely well at her current place of living. She has not been in therapy or on medication to my knowledge for several years at this point. I know she was in therapy most of her life, but I don't know if it was SPECIFICALLY for BPD, but considering how she acts sometimes and her ability to self-reflect in a way that seems legitimate I believe she may have been in therapy for that. 

I went through the typical love bombing - everything was great. We got along, she made so much effort to text me in the morning, invite me over, find things to do together, good night texts, constantly reassurance, etc. She asked for the same amount of reassurance so I did the same.

  
At this point I'm going to just post a rough timeline of how I see the relationship at this very moment to avoid having 20 more paragraphs.

  
\- Got together - Relationship was GREAT for 1-2 months

\- She was forced to move and was being financially manipulated by her mother (this is actually true as I witnessed it first hand) The new house was smaller and she had the worlds tiniest bedroom. . . while working 20-24 hours on sat/sunday and 20-30 hours at her day job.

\- While moving she was working a second job to earn extra money and catch her credit card up that her mother mostly ran up . . .and her mom kept finding ways to sap her money away.

\- During this time the poor treatment started. There was an issue with EVERYTHING I did. I couldn't stand right, I couldn't breathe right, I couldn't drive right - any little tiny thing I did was met with scoffs, huffing, irritation etc. . . if I tried to remove myself from the situation by going home she would cry and I would feel absolutely terrible. I let a lot of this slide ONLY because I was very communicative about my issues with her and she often respond like this ""I need a little time to process but I promise I'll try to answer everything when I can."" Then I would receive an extremely heartfelt message apologizing and addressing all of the issues. She would bring up that she has BPD, but hates feeling like she's using that as an excuse. She would say she tends to push people away after a while and promise that she would make an effort, which never came.

  
Eventually We moved in together due to me needing space from GF A and due to her (pwbpd) needing to get away from her toxing living situation with her mother.

  
Keep in mind during this entire 6 months I showed up for her physically, mentally, and emotionally EVERY single day. I met her bad moments with calmness, care, and love, and as much understanding as I could muster. I never raised my voice with her and never got snippy.

The positives:

\- She would buy me nice things like flowers etc. especially if I wasn't having a great day/week etc.

\- She constantly told me ""I love you"" regardless of if we were having good days or bad days - the reassurance I needed considering issues with my past relationship

\- I received nice little gestures like notes on my laptop that say ""I love you""

\- For a while she actually talked to me about my issues and her issues and made extreme efforts to give me an outlet as couples should do.



The negatives:

Over the course of 3-4 months I experienced the following:

\- The good morning texts stopped

\- She started retracting from kisses/hugs

\- Sex stopped abruptly. She literally was sending me porn nearly daily for a while and talking about all of the things she wanted to do. I didn't receive any for a few days then all of a sudden a bunch came in . . . and that's the very day sex stopped.

\- Any talk about money was met with anger and frustration, but she would express that she /wanted/ to figure out money because she felt like she ""owed me tons"" of money.

\- She stopped playing videogames with me

\- Texts/snaps etc. would get read and I would get a ""I'll respond later"" but the responses never came

\- She started sleeping more

\- She seemed to hide her phone screen often, but said she doesn't do it on purpose and has nothing to hide

\- My thumbprint got removed from her phone randomly (i never once tried to access her phone, but I felt off and put my thumb on her phone one day after she left the room and it wouldn't open)

\- Snapchat texts to her would get opened and not responded to. If I asked about it I would receive a promise to a response ""eventually"" - days / weeks / a month would pass and no response would arrive

\- She started claiming that I ""Don't understand her"" and she feels ""unheard"" 

There's a lot more....

  
Eventually we had a pseudo breakup. When we were in the middle of it, both extremely upset, she said ""this isn't a breakup talk, but what is going to happen if we do at some point? Then we went grocery shopping and she surprised me with new sleep pants and flowers. I thought everything was okay.

  
During this drive she said ""Do you want to go to therapy with me?"" This EXCITED ME TO THE CORE. I didn't realize you can't do DBT with multiple people. I'm not the type of person to go to therapy, but I was so excited to go with to what I would assume would be couples therapy with her because I wanted her to get the push to do better. The topic never came up again...

Then one day the real breakup. She had a friend over and something got brought up. She made a negative comment, during a positive moment, about how I ""Take everything away"" or something but refused to repeat or elaborate and now claims she never said that. I went silent and she texted me saying 

""Are you upset with me?""

I said

""why do you ask? I'm sorry if I'm being too quiet.""

She said:

""Just felt a mood shift.""

Me:

""I'm struggling a little, dont worry""

Her:

""Are you sure?""

  
Me:

""I love you.""

Her:

""I love you too.""

Eventually she said

""I don't think this is a healthy relationship for us anymore...""

and everything went downhill from there.



She claimed she still wanted to be friends. I'm one of two people she has - her best friend and myself.

We still live together out of necessity. 

  
Here are the things I'm caught up on.

\- I didn't have a bed when we first broke up. She asked to buy me a mattress because sleeping in the same bed was ""emotionally taxing.""

\- We have a white board hanging on the fridge. We often posted nice little things on it like I love you notes to each other etc. and wrote on it as well. She erased a loving message from the whiteboard, but left ALL of the nice little notes etc. up. They have been up for weeks without any change, but she said they are a sore spot for her.

\- The day we broke up we were talking and I mentioned that I would still do things for her like make her coffee just to be nice and make her life easier. When I said this she cried and walked out.

\- She threw away the flowers she got me (not maliciously) because they died and apologized that she didn't take the best care of them. They actually lived a good while. I went into her bathroom yesterday (it has been around 20 days since we broke up) and found that some roses I got her were still on her bathroom counter, but she did a DEEP clean and complete reorganization of her living space.

\- Right before the true breakup, while we were having issues, she would do things like hand me my coffee and then pull me in for a kiss.

\- I asked her if I ever made me happy and she responded like this ""You did for a while. You still do."" ""I just. Have issues. No matter where I go, what I do, who it is.""

I asked her to elaborate as to why I make/made her happy and she said the following:

  
""Because you try to take the time to understand me. Even when I'm just being shitty for no good reason... You still took the time to try and love me, care about me, do nice things for me and support me in anyway you could. Which hurts. Really badly.""

There are so many contradicting statements like this . . . how can you do so much supposedly right, but this person just cuts you out so quickly?

I asked her if I could ask some questions for closure and she agreed to it. When the time came I was ""throwing everything in her face,"" ""Comparing her to my ex,"" and doing mental gymnastics. She did not answer ANY of my questions so now I'm even more confused.

She has been giving me the cold shoulder at home for WEEKS - which I have expressed to her bothers me. The main reason is because I have zero friends. She has her best friend to turn to and I have nobody so I'm really struggling. I told her I would just like to occasionally hang out in the living room in silent company or watch tv/play a videogame etc.

I had a particularly bad day - sick, not feeling good, etc. and I didn't give her much attention this day. She ended up CRASHING out over this. Crying, upset about my short responses etc. 

She sometimes will vent to me and ANY input I give is met with annoyance, irritation, and malice so I just have to sit there and listen to her vent about her friend, her family, etc. The thing is - Almost EVERYTHING she complains about is things she did to me and is still doing to me, but I can't bring them up because she won't acknowledge it. 

I'm stuck living in this situation until September of 2026. I feel like if I just leave and go stay at my old place she might crash out even harder. 



I've been reading more and more and more and I see that a lot of her issues are common BPD patterns. Its so damning that some of the wording she has used and uses can be found all throughout threads about BPD. Word. For. Word.

The confusion is unreal. I can read about everything over and over and over and it still never ""makes sense."" Its pretty much impossible to make any sort of rational sense out of someone struggling with BPD.

  
At the end of it all here are the things I feel currently.

\- Saddened about what people with BPD go through. My emotions have been extremely intense this year. I feel like if mine are that intense theirs must be 10,000x worse.

\- Sad it didn't work out

\- Sad she isn't in therapy

\- Upset about my unfair treatment

\- Confused about seemingly doing everything ""right"" and getting tossed away

\- I wish she would get into therapy and we could try again with conditions (stay in therapy, answers to questions I have, etc.)

\- Mad that I feel lied to and betrayed

\- Upset I don't have closure or answers

\- Somewhat relieved/excited that I can try to see other people

\- Extremely distraught that I have no friends to turn to, but she brings her best friend home and I hear them having a great time and also discussing doing things that are very similar to things I planned for myself and her.

\- Confused as to how she can love me but not be with me

\- Upset that I come home and basically sit in silence and isolation all day. If I bring this up its an issue

\- Upset that she vents to me, but somehow can't seem to see that she did the very things to me that she hates others doing to her

\- Extremely upset about my 8.5 year relationship being gone. My ex actually said she would want to fix things, but that she was pursuing something. I feel I was a few days too late in this regard

\- I don't hate her

\- I would love to keep her around as a true friend, but her treatment towards me is terrible. She has mentioned that its ""difficult to go back to the way things were"" before. 

  
There is so much more, but the post is too long and its all over the place so I'll just leave it there.

  
People. Please avoid dating people with BPD unless they are in constant therapy and doing the work. They aren't necessarily bad people, but they have bad tendencies and can ruin your life and mental state. This is the hardest part for me because when I become attached to someone I am beyond loyal to them and will do everything to make it clear that I am their friend and/or loved one. This person became the ONE person I thought I had and it quickly got ripped away from me, supposedly at no fault of my own.

📊 Stats from my 6-month job search:

→ 3 Offers (still waiting for 2 more)

A few takeaways from my personal experience:

1. Career fairs are underrated. Seriously. 4 out of my 9 interviews came directly from career fairs. Recruiters actually look at your resume, and you get to skip the ATS black hole. If your school has career fairs, GO. Even if you feel underprepared. The worst that happens is you get practice talking to recruiters.

2. Stop doing unnecessary coffee chats. Just message people on LinkedIn directly: ""Hey, I saw \[company\] is hiring for \[role\]. Would you be open to referring me?"" Clear, direct. Got 6 referrals this way.

3. The Microsoft Student Ambassadors program was a game changer for me. Having ""Microsoft"" on your resume catches recruiters' eyes. After I added the Microsoft title, I noticed a clear increase in OA invites. It's free to join, you learn stuff, and it gives you something on the resume if you have no experience. Here is the link:

4. Keep your resume as short as possible. 1 line for each bullet point. And just keep applying every day.",0,1765733717.0,csMajors,0,0.5,False

For anyone who didn’t see my original post, here’s the backstory:

I met a woman at ShopRite recently. She’s 40, I’m 27. We crossed paths twice in the store, and the second time she stopped and talked to me. She was smiling, asked my age, and the vibe felt really natural and warm. I asked for her Instagram, she hesitated for a second but ended up giving it to me, and we followed each other.

We started messaging later. She told me she has two teenage kids, and our convo was pretty solid — not dry, she was engaging and giving real answers, not just one‑word replies.

Here’s where the timeline matters:

- She posted an IG story saying this is her last year being single, because she had to go outside and shovel the snow by herself.  
- In the story she repeated that 2026 she’s going to be “outside” more.  
- So that basically confirmed she’s single and thinking about not wanting to be alone.

After seeing that, I replied to her story and asked her out — I told her I’d like to take her out this week, lunch or coffee.

Her response was:

> “Boy, are you persistent.. this week’s gonna be pretty crazy for me I have a trip coming up for my son’s volleyball tournament so I don’t know. Maybe we can try next week if not because of the holidays definitely could start the year off that way lol”

So she:
- acknowledged my persistence in a playful way  
- didn’t say no  
- said this week is crazy  
- suggested next week, and if that doesn’t work, starting the year off that way

I’m very attracted to her, and I’m not really looking for anything super serious. I’m more interested in something casual or short‑term if the chemistry is there, but I want to be respectful because she’s older, has kids, and clearly has a lot on her plate.

My question:  
Given her response and the fact she’s clearly single and open to going out eventually, what’s the best way to move forward? How do I keep things smooth and respectful but be honest that I’m mostly looking for something casual? Anyone with experience with older women or age‑gap dynamics, I’d appreciate some perspective.

1pmjpjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1pmjpjm/recommendations_for_an_online_home_group/,Recommendations for an online home group,"OK, I know this is a long shot, but could anyone recommend an online group that would be suitable as a home group, where there is the ability to engage in fellowship before or after. The times I'm looking for are 7am - 11am UK time or 11pm - 1am UK time.

To add some background...

I used to have an in-person home group pre-COVID of around 20-30 people, whereby we had a meeting before the meeting in a coffee shop, and a meeting after the meeting in the parking lot. These times outside the meeting itself were invaluable in getting to know people, hear & learn from their sobriety journeys, and to get a feel for if I really wanted to have someone's number or indeed sound them out about sponsorship.

I had to move far away into the countryside, where in-person meetings are not available. Over the years since, I've found myself drifting between random online meetings, but its not working. I need to get back to having a stable home group, albeit online, at which I can earnestly search for a new sponsor to rework the steps and get back to commitments.

Now I know the times are rubbish, that particular constraint is one that I am trying to take responsibility for by changing my employment situation so that I can get back to the usual 9-5, and so be available for early evening meetings which are the most popular time. But finding a new job is taking way longer than I would have hoped, and its dangerous for my recovery to be put on hold for that.

I've come to realise how important a home group is, and how grounding it was for me back before COVID. I feel like a tourist without one, and my recovery is all over the place and beset with relapses.

Any recommendations for online groups that could act as a solid home group would be greatly appreciated. I don't care where the online group is ""located"", for instance Europe/US based, just so long as it is has potential to be a good home group during the above UK times. There are meetings and there are committed groups that meet. I need to find the latter.

I've been learning Italian with my tutor for almost a year now. The lessons are great - we're the same age and gender, and we often share personal things during our conversations. We even follow each other on Instagram. We don't really talk outside of the lessons, but sometimes they run 20 minutes longer simply because we end up chatting.

My tutor lives in Lithuania, and I live in Italy, so we've never met in real life. Today, though, they told me they're going to Prague for Christmas. We started talking about how it could be nice to meet, but the thing is, I don't really like Prague, and they know that. They said, ""Oh, I know you don't like Prague - don't come. We can see each other in June when I come to Zurich,"" which would actually be much closer for me. I really don’t like Prague, and funny they remembered it. 

Now I'm not sure what to do. Part of me feels like I'd be happy to travel there just to meet them and have a coffee, but at the same time it feels like it might be too big of a gesture from my side. I also have two other friends in Prague whom I could meet, so even if I go, it would be a nice trip anyway.

1pmjl5a,https://archive.ph/ZIB3n,Thousands of carveouts and caveats are weakening Trump's emergency tariffs,"President Donald Trump promised that a wave of emergency tariffs on nearly every nation would restore “fair” trade and jump-start the economy.

Eight months later, half of U.S. imports are avoiding those tariffs.

“To all of the foreign presidents, prime ministers, kings, queens, ambassadors, and everyone else who will soon be calling to ask for exemptions from these tariffs,” Trump said in April when he rolled out global tariffs based on the United States’ trade deficits with other countries, “I say, terminate your own tariffs, drop your barriers, don’t manipulate your currencies.”

But in the time since the president gave that Rose Garden speech announcing the highest tariffs in a century, enormous holes have appeared. Carveouts for specific products, trade deals with major allies and conflicting import duties have let more than half of all imports escape his sweeping emergency tariffs.

Some $1.6 trillion in annual imports are subject to the tariffs, while at least $1.7 trillion are excluded, either because they are duty-free or subject to another tariff, according to a POLITICO analysis based on last year’s import data. The exemptions on thousands of goods could undercut Trump’s effort to protect American manufacturing, shrink the trade deficit and raise new revenue to fund his domestic agenda.

In September, the White House exempted hundreds of goods, including critical minerals and industrial materials, totaling nearly $280 billion worth of annual imports. Then in November, the administration exempted $252 billion worth of mostly agricultural imports like beef, coffee and bananas, some of which are not widely produced in the U.S. — just after cost-of-living issues became a major talking point out of Democratic electoral victories — on top of the hundreds of other carveouts.

“The administration, for most of this year, spent a lot of time saying tariffs are a way to offload taxes onto foreigners,” said Ed Gresser, a former assistant U.S. trade representative under Democratic and Republican administrations, including Trump’s first term, who now works at the Progressive Policy Institute, a D.C.-based think tank. “I think that becomes very hard to continue arguing when you then say, ‘But we are going to get rid of tariffs on coffee and beef, and that will bring prices down.’ … It’s a big retreat in principle.”

The Trump administration has argued that higher tariffs would rebalance the United States’ trade deficits with many of its major trading partners, which Trump blames for the “hollowing out” of U.S. manufacturing in what he evoked as a “national emergency.” Before the Supreme Court, the administration is defending the president’s use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enact the tariffs, and Trump has said that a potential court-ordered end to the emergency tariffs would be “country-threatening.”

In an interview with POLITICO on Monday, Trump said he was open to adding even more exemptions to tariffs. He downplayed the existing carveouts as “very small” and “not a big deal,” and said he plans to pair them with tariff increases elsewhere.

Responding to POLITICO’s analysis, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said, “The Trump administration is implementing a nuanced and nimble tariff agenda to address our historic trade deficit and safeguard our national security. This agenda has already resulted in trillions in investments to make and hire in America along with over a dozen trade deals with some of America’s most important trade partners.”

To date, the majority of exemptions to the “reciprocal” tariffs — the minimum 10 percent levies on most countries — have been for reasons other than new trade deals, according to POLITICO’s analysis.

The White House also pushed back against the notion that November’s cuts were made in an effort to reduce food prices, saying that the exemptions were first outlined in the September order. The U.S. granted subsequent blanket exemptions, regardless of the status of countries’ trade negotiations with the Trump administration, after announcing several trade deals.

Following the exemptions on agricultural tariffs, Trump announced on Monday a $12 billion relief aid package for farmers hurt by tariffs and rising production costs. The money will come from an Agriculture Department fund, though the president said it was paid for by revenue from tariffs (by law, Congress would need to approve spending the money that tariffs bring in).

In addition to the exemptions from Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, more than $300 billion of imports are also exempted as part of trade deals the administration has negotiated in recent months, including with the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan and more recently, Malaysia, Cambodia and Brazil. The deal with Brazil removed a range of products from a cumulative tariff of 50 percent, making two-thirds of imports from the country free from emergency tariffs.

For Canadian and Mexican goods, Trump imposed tariffs under a separate emergency justification over fentanyl trafficking and undocumented migrants. But about half of imports from Mexico and nearly 40 percent of those from Canada will not face tariffs because of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement that Trump negotiated in his first term. Last year, importers claimed USMCA exemptions on $405 billion in goods; that value is expected to increase, given that the two countries are facing high tariffs for the first time in several years.

The Trump administration has also exempted several products — including autos, steel and aluminum — from the emergency reciprocal tariffs because they already face duties under Section 232 of the U.S. Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The imports covered by those tariffs could total up to $900 billion annually, some of which may also be exempt under USMCA. The White House is considering using the law to justify further tariffs on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and several other industries.

For now, the emergency tariffs remain in place as the Supreme Court weighs whether Trump exceeded his authority in imposing them. In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Trump’s use of emergency authority was unlawful — a decision the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld in August. During oral arguments on Nov. 5, several Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism that the emergency statute authorizes a president to levy tariffs, a power constitutionally assigned to Congress.

As the rates of tariffs and their subsequent exemptions are quickly added and amended, businesses are struggling to keep pace, said Sabine Altendorf, an economist with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

“When there’s uncertainty and rapid changes, it makes operations very difficult,” Altendorf said. “Especially for agricultural products where growing times and planting times are involved, it’s very important for market actors to be able to plan ahead.”

1pmji2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/1pmji2l/ha_recovery_tiktok_is_just_ed_recovery/,“HA recovery” TikTok is just ED recovery,"Anyone notice this trend on TikTok? “Fitness influencers” are coming out in droves talking about how they’re losing their periods and haven’t had one in over a year, their hair is falling out, they’re cold all the time, they’re dealing with constant “food noise”, brain fog, fatigue, “burnout”, emotional instability, lanugo, GI issues and chronic constipation, etc. Obviously all signs of malnourishment and starvation as none of these things are fundamentally different in any way from the physical symptoms that often stem from having a restrictive eating disorder, but they don’t say that, of course. They call it being “lean” instead of severely underweight. They call it “finding food freedom” or “healing” their “relationship” with food instead of recovery. And, when presented with the inevitable process of weight restoration/regain that naturally comes with stopping restriction, they call it “HA recovery” or “growing”. 

When you go onto any of these “fitness” accounts and look at their WIEIAD videos, which are typically superabundant (further highlighting their unhealthy fixation with what they’re consuming, because they feel a compulsive need to document everything), it’s so blatantly obvious they’re struggling with disordered eating. All of the diet substitutes, sugar-free substitutes, rice cakes, low-fat cottage cheese, non-fat Greek yogurt, egg whites, unseasoned chicken breast, riced cauliflower, protein bars. Classic ana “safe” foods. Then you have the excessive caffeine consumption—they’re drinking 3-4 zero sugar energy drinks or several black coffees throughout the course of a single day. The over-reliance on “supplements” in the form of pills or powdered packets is also jarring. 

There are also usually several other obvious disordered behaviors, such as an obsession with volume eating low-calorie, high fiber foods, partaking in “intermittent fasting”, and generally having several other food rules. They all weigh their food to the gram and calorie count. They also typically talk a LOT about “discipline” and avoiding sugar, carbs, fats, seed oils, essentially removing entire food groups from their diet. They all have a crazy preoccupation with protein and eat multiple times over the recommended daily intake. Any deviation from their restrictive eating is promptly referred to as “binging”, which they all proclaim to struggle with, despite their definition of binge eating being, like, two donuts and a single cookie after not consuming any real sugar for several months. Then they break down on camera and cry and express extreme mental anguish and guilt for ruining their “progress”. 

I also have noticed these types of accounts exclusively refer to eating as “fueling” like they cannot comprehend eating for any other reason aside from having the absolute bare minimum—often well BELOW the bare minimum—means for their body to SURVIVE. Not even optimally function, just basic survival! And it’s even worse because these types of influencers are also typically engaging in forms of compulsive exercise, are obsessed with step counts and being in the gym for multiple hours at a time 4-5 days a week, all while documenting a consumption of 1/3 of the intake they need to sustain such an active lifestyle.

It’s so fucking insane how we have completely repackaged having anorexia or a restrictive ED as a normal part of being on a “fitness journey”. It’s also grim how they only really perceive dealing with HA as an undesirable side effect of restrictive eating, and usually will swear that once they regain their period they’ll resume their restrictive “lifestyle”. The “HA recovery” content is also underscored by extreme distress at the process of weight gain, just countless videos of these people sobbing that they cannot stand being in a body with over single-digit body fat percentage. There is nothing remotely healthy about any of this content whatsoever, these influencers are so steeped in their disordered eating habits that they cannot conceive of a life outside of it.",8,1765732892.0,fuckeatingdisorders,6,0.9,False

I want to start off by saying that I don't think the general British public is very racist in 2025, especially compared to parts of mainland Europe. Apart from a few anecdotal encounters, I don't often experience racism towards me in daily life (work and professional settings) so far as a minority from East Asia. Thank you!

I wanted to ask a slightly deeper question and look at this topic on a romantic relationship level. I have friends of different ethnicities (majority White/Caucasian) in the UK, and most of them are good friends and lovely people. However, when it comes to pursuing a romantic relationship with white/caucasian women (as a straight man), there have been a number of occasions where I can feel that they are not interested in having romance with people of my ethnicity. Now, I wouldn't go as far as classifying it as racism just yet, because preferences do exist and I think that 'being racist' and 'having own preference' are two different things.

I have spoken to some east asian groups (some are British born, some are not). And what I gather from some of their experiences is that generally speaking, they think people in the UK are indeed 'racist' towards people of ethnic minority when it comes to relationships. Quite a lot of women worry that dating someone non-white will somehow 'decrease' her values in her social groups. Some women are open to dating minorities but are not really open to being 'with them' long-term or marrying them. They do not want to present a non-white boyfriend/husband to friends or families.

I am not a woman and I do not date men, so I cannot provide a personal perspective on the reverse side. However, what I can say is, according to what I see in real life, men in the UK doesn't seem to have issues dating women of ethnic minorities. In public places (streets, coffee shops, supermarkets, etc), for every 100 white/minority heterosexual couple, the men is the white one in more than 95 of cases. When I was in university, I know about 20-30ish mixed classmates. All but one of them have a British/white surname, implying that the white parent is their dad.

All of the above are only my personal experiences and what I have seen in real life in the UK. Therefore, I want to ask this sub whether you think generally speaking, the above is true or not. I am also aware that these are also sensitive topics (racism, gender issues etc), so please be polite and civil to each other. Thank you!",0,1765732318.0,AskABrit,48,0.37,False
1pmj9bl,https://www.reddit.com/r/rc_cars/comments/1pmj9bl/custom_build_help/,Custom Build Help,"Hello folks. 

Not sure what else to ask. I'm looking to build a little remote control coffee cart for my father. 

My dad has an essential tremor and cannot carry a full coffee cup the 15 ft. From the microwave in their home to his chair where he drinks his coffee each morning. My mother is able to help him, but I'd like to offer him an alternative that gives him a little bit more Independence for when she's out of the house. 

The floor surface is tile and laminate and there is a small threshold between the two that it would have to go over. What I'm specifically looking for recommendations on is an RC base that I could build this little cart on. Whatever I build has to be tall enough and stable enough that a 6-ft tall man can place a cup of coffee on it, walk over to his chair and then have it drive over to him without spilling the coffee.

Thank you. 

We lived under the red star, and the star never blinked.

My name doesn’t matter. In the village they still call me by my father’s name, and that is enough.

I was nine the year the older boy hit me with the pipe.

Third grade, morning shift. Classes ended at 13:30 because the factory needed the mothers and fathers for the second rotation. 

Four kilometres of cracked asphalt and dust between the school and the block of flats. No buses; petrol belonged to the State. 

Children walked alone. 

That was the rule.

He stepped out from the poplars that lined the irrigation canal. 

Fourteen, maybe fifteen. Eighth-grade uniform, red Pioneer scarf knotted like a noose. 

He didn’t speak. 

Just raised the iron pipe—cut-off scaffolding, the kind we stole from collective farms to fix our balconies—and brought it down on the exact same place a guard in Siberia had once broken my grandfather’s skull.

I remember the sun flashing on the metal. 

Then the world went red. 

I stayed behind, watching him walk away without a care. 

Blood mixed with my tears, hands pressed to my head while I asked the empty air, 

“Why? Why did you hit me? 

What did I ever do to you?” 

The feeling of impotence was overwhelming. He was too big, too strong. I cried because I could do nothing else.

I made it home by walking in the ditch so nobody saw the blood. 

Told my mother I’d fallen off the parallel bars. She looked at me once, saw the lie, and beat me anyway for ruining the shirt. 

The Party gave us one new shirt every two years, so I had really done it this time.

I never told anyone who did it. Informing was for dogs.

Six years later I was fifteen. The country still wore grey, but the grey had begun to rot at the edges.

The older boys were doing their two years of “patriotic service.” 

They came home on Sunday passes drunk with power and plum brandy, uniforms too big for the men they hadn’t become. 

I was buying cigarettes behind the bus station with coins I’d stolen from the factory collection box when I heard his voice—older, thicker, but the same laugh.

He was telling his friend they would meet two girls at the old path above the hidden beach. 

The path the border guards had stopped patrolling after the minefield was laid farther north. 

Thirty metres straight down to rocks and black water. I knew every stone. 

That was the place I grew up—where we hid to smoke, where we made campfires when the militia was someone we knew or just a lazy communist.

Hearing that voice reopened a wound that had never truly closed. 

That night the rage came back, colder than the day it happened. 

I remembered my mother’s beatings, and the scar on my scalp still ached. 

I went down to the basement, took the same kind of pipe (still there, still rusted, heavy and cold), and walked to the cliffs. I hid just metres from the path, crouched in the bushes. 

Outside it was already dark, and a warm spring wind pushed the salty breath of the Black Sea into my face.

The girls arrived first, scarves pulled low, whispering about university exams they would never be allowed to take. 

They passed two metres from me and smelled of cheap lilac water.

A few minutes later the boys came along the same path.

I stood up behind them.

The first swing found the exact same place where he had scarred me. 

He dropped like a sack of maize. 

His friend screamed once—a thin, useless sound swallowed by the sea—and ran.

I hit until the pipe was soft with hair and the rocks underneath were wet. 

A strange feeling of freedom and relief surged through me. Blood boiled in my veins. I was not scared. I felt no remorse.

Then I ran.

It was 22:30 when I reached the block. Blood had dried into a second skin, but I hadn’t realised I was covered in it.

My mother opened the door, saw me, and dragged me into the kitchen by the hair. 

When she realised the blood was not mine, she went quiet—the way people go quiet before a storm. 

Then she started hitting. 

Not slaps; closed fists, the way her own father had taught her after crawling back from Siberia missing four toes and all mercy. 

She used the wooden spoon the Pioneer committee had awarded her for “exemplary ideological education of the child.” 

She slammed my head against the walls. 

I felt warm blood running down my back. 

I didn’t defend myself—she gave me this treatment every week. 

I only hoped one day she would hit hard enough that I never got up again. 

Pain had lost all meaning. 

Life had never had any value for me until that night.

My father came in barefoot, eyes still red from the night shift. 

He tried to pull her off. 

She bit his wrist. 

He struck her once—the way men hit under communism when words are no longer enough. 

She fell between the table and the stove and stayed there.

The kitchen smelled of blood, coffee, and fear.

My father washed my face in the sink, water running pink into the drain.

“What did you do? Why did she do this? Tell me.”

You move apartments, you change jobs, or your priorities shift.

Suddenly, the app’s pre-set categories and rigid rules do not fit anymore.

You feel like you are fighting the software just to track your reality.

Tiller works differently because it is built in a spreadsheet.



We provide a Foundation Template to get you started, but you are not stuck with it.



You can customize your categories to match exactly how you spend.

If you want to track ""Coffee"" separately from ""Restaurants,"" you just add a row.

If you are self-employed, you can tag expenses as ""Business"" to estimate your quarterly taxes.

You can then use our AutoCat tool to create custom rules that sort your transactions automatically based on your specific needs.

You can tell it that every time ""Starbucks"" appears, it goes to ""Coffee,"" not just generic ""Dining.""

It allows you to build a system that adapts to your goals, rather than forcing your goals into a static app.

1pmj4ua,https://i.redd.it/hh81kluw077g1.jpeg,*SPOILERS AHEAD* Pirates of Coffee Advent Calendar Review,"I'm travelling over break, so I had to accelerate the usual timeline of an Advent calendar, and I just finished enjoying my final cup, so I'll share my thoughts here along with which coffees you should consider purchasing if you decide to order from them. The full list can be found [at this link](https://piratesofcoffee.com/blogs/news/coffee-advent-calendar-2025) if you want to peruse. I won't go through them all, but if you have any questions about individual coffees, I took notes and ranked all of them, so I can provide you with thoughts and scores out of 10 in the comments.

**The Good**:   
  
The coffees were generally very nice and high-quality. I was a little disappointed that they didn't include as many premium offerings this year, but I understand that would have affected the price, and it made up for it by mostly good-quality across the board.

The price was reasonable. $75 with the discount they offered for early orders is reasonable for what they offered. Even with Tariffs bringing that up to $90, I still would consider that pretty good for the experience.

The amount of coffee was generous but not overwhelming. 20g is definitely enough for most people to enjoy once a day, but not enough to where you wouldn't be able to enjoy other coffees while you have the advent calendar. I suppose 50g would allow for a trial brew, but really, I prefer just one dose a day. They also NEVER sold me short. It was actually always slightly more than 20g in each container, so I could be fully assured that I would have enough for my usual dose. In fact, there was enough extra in each container that I was able to make three ""Frankenbrews"" out of it. The little extra amounts even got more generous as the calendar went on, and the average quality went up. The first Frankenbrew took 10 coffees to make 20g, the second took 9 coffees, and the third only took 5, and each of them was exactly 20g, so I did not have to mix with coffees I had on my shelf. They should absolutely make sure they keep doing this-it made me so happy!

**Needs Improvement:**

The packaging was a bit clunky. The box could have used work; It was unnecessary to have a plastic tray inside when the box simply could have been structured better. It was also too long. I get the tradition of opening the doors every day, but it's frankly annoying to actually do, and it would be way simpler and easier to just include the individual containers in a more compact box without the stupid cardboard doors.

Tariffs could have been included at sale. I was charged $15 for tariffs after delivery. I understand this is not the company's fault, but it would be nice of them just to raise their prices and release a statement about tariffs like September did, rather than have the customer get an unfortunate surprise later on.

Their brew guides suck. Not all seem to be tailored to the specific coffee, and of the ones that are, I found their ratios to sometimes be off and their temperatures to often be too high. When I followed my gut and brewed them on my Switch like I normally would if I hadn't been given a brew guide, my cups came out better.

Medium-Dark roast ""Regular"" coffees could probably be left out entirely. I liked the Cocoa Bomb from Brazil fine, but the other two were just ""Brown"" and lacking in body, complexity, and depth. Just bitter tbh. These were the only real duds of the set. To be honest, if someone orders this calendar, they should know what they are getting into, and the kinds of people who order this with awareness are very rarely interested in medium roast ""Hazelnut, Dark Chocolate, Caramel"" coffees.

**TLDR:** Overall, a worthwhile experience with very good coffee and pricing, with small drawbacks. I would definitely recommend 8/10

**Top 5 Coffees:**

**1. Day 24:** [Aeria Gesha Anaerobic Honey](https://piratesofcoffee.com/products/aeria-gesha-colombia-anaerobic-honey?_pos=1&_psq=aeria+ges&_ss=e&_v=1.0)**:** **9.7/10** If you include one Gesha as your last coffee, there's a lot riding on it. It better deliver incredible flavor, and oh boy, this one delivered. Multi-Dimensional with nice florality when hot, transitioning to sweet and fruity as it cooled. Smelled like Watermelon Jolly Ranchers from bean to cup, but that note did not dominate in the taste and instead worked in harmony with the floral and acidic notes. Brewed using Coffee Chronicler Hybrid Switch method at 93C at a 7.5 on the K-Ultra using filtered tap water. 1:16 ratio

**2. Day 14:** [Hamasho Natural Ethiopia](https://piratesofcoffee.com/products/hamasho-ethiopia-natural?_pos=1&_psq=hamasho&_ss=e&_v=1.0)**: 9.2/10** A very well-balanced natural Ethiopian, one of my favorite terroir and process combinations. I brewed this one when my non-coffee-nerd roommate was around, and I offered him a sip. He was amazed as well, despite being the guy who uses a pod machine and 3 heaping teaspoons of sugar in his coffee. I think that's all that needs to be said. Brewed as 90C full immersion with switch thrown at 6 minutes at a 7.5 on the K-Ultra using filtered tap water. 1:17 ratio

**3. Day 20:** [Elixir Honey Cultured](https://piratesofcoffee.com/products/elixir-colombia-honey-culturing?_pos=1&_psq=elixir&_ss=e&_v=1.0)**: 9/10** Kind of everything I could want from a ""funky"" coffee. Extremely fruity with shockingly accurate flavor notes, but not overwhelming or boozy at the extraction I brewed. Brewed using Coffee Chronicler Hybrid Switch method at 90C at a 7.5 on the K-Ultra using filtered tap water. 1:15 ratio

**4. Day 7:** [Bloom Ethiopia Washed](https://piratesofcoffee.com/products/bloom-daye-bensa-abore-washed?_pos=1&_sid=98e97b619&_ss=r)**: 8.7/10** Love a good washed Ethiopia, and this one was exactly that. It had that powdered sugar and light stone fruit quality that's so appealing to me. Brewed using Coffee Chronicler Hybrid Switch method at 91C at a 7.5 on the K-Ultra using filtered tap water. 1:17 ratio

**5. Day 20:** [Melonhead Nitro Fermentation Caturra](https://piratesofcoffee.com/products/melonhead-nitro-colombia-nitro-fermentation?_pos=1&_psq=melonhead+nitro&_ss=e&_v=1.0)**: 8.6/10** I've had basically this exact thing from B&W before, but this one was better. Smelled so much like Canteloupe at every stage, and it really did deliver that melon flavor. The one from B&W had a bit of a melon rind bitterness that was not so pleasant but this one did not. Brewed using Coffee Chronicler Hybrid Switch method at 90C at a 7.5 on the K-Ultra using filtered tap water. 1:16 ratio",4,1765732013.0,pourover,3,0.83,False

I'm not sure why I have such a hard time believing my parents are being honest and transparent, but they are.



I think down deep there are things that are fishy and suspicious with my mother, father, stepfather that they've never communicated or taken accountability for, even if their intentions were good.



I was asked, ""did I drink coffee this morning?""



Yes, I drank a fair amount of coffee and it can cause mania and psychosis, but it's a deeper rooted problem than being hopped up on caffeine. Though, the coffee certainly can make it worse.



Try to trust and believe people are being genuine.



There are deceivers and betrayers, but most people are face value. 



I think that's why animals are great. Cats and dogs can't keep secrets and are usually genuinely wholesome. However, there are dogs like pitbulls that can be dangerous. Animals are still animals and you can't reason with them even if they're cute, adorable, tiny doggies, but at least they're honest. they have good intuition about people.



Sadly, I have mood swings. I'm not sure if it's genetic or a result of traumatic life experiences like getting betrayed, but it was a nightmare.

1pmiz49,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1pmiz49/we_fought_the_aliens_but_never_asked_why_they_came/,"We Fought the Aliens, But Never Asked Why They Came","I woke before the alarms because the air felt wrong and the ground carried a small hum through the floorboards. I dressed by habit. Boots, belt, rifle sling, med pouch, ear protection in a pocket, gloves through the rear loop. I stepped onto the porch and tasted dust. The sky was a cold line in the east with a smear of smoke that was not from any field burn I knew. I sat for a minute and chewed a dry piece of straw and kept my hands still so I would not shake. I looked at the old shotgun leaning by the railing and left it where it was because today called for reach and control, not comfort. I took the AR, worked the bolt, and checked the chamber. I checked the tourniquet rubber banded to the stock, the pressure bandage in the pouch, and the spare batteries in a film can. I put on ear pro and felt heavier, which always helps.

Trucks rolled in on the gravel in a steady rhythm. County rigs, ranch flatbeds, a refinery pickup with a welder bolted to the bed, a school bus with the word BAND painted over in brown house paint. People climbed out and kept their voices low. Old Guard vets from two wars back. Farmhands with fencing pliers on their belts. Refinery mechanics with burns on their sleeves. Lunch ladies from the school still in sneakers. The school principal with a clipboard and a pistol in an old holster. Mason took the center like he always did when something had to move without drama. He wore a plain shirt and kept a pencil behind his ear. He unrolled a county map on my truck hood and held it with a socket set and a jar of nails.

“We split three ways,” he said. “Roadblock at the washout. Kill box at the feed store. Flank element along the canal. Reserve holds here and runs resupply and med shuttle. Holden takes the feed store. Annie runs the washout. Drew takes the canal. Radios stay short. No sky fire unless we can mark a lock and call it twice. Nobody plays hero. We finish what we start and we leave before their revenge pass.”

I walked my team through a fast check. Rifles, bolts wet, mags seated. Shotguns for the close spots. A handful of hunting rifles with glass. Two homemade mortars with coffee can charges and fuses taped into rubber tube. We had starboard and port hand signals because half the people could not hear well anymore, and shouting would only draw eyes. We loaded hedgehogs made from rebar triangles and welded plate. We stacked sandbags and filled them with a mix of sand and feed corn to add weight. We cut tangle wire and rolled it on broom handles so it would deploy without a fight. We dragged old road signs to use as shields. We taped red chem lights to the inside of barrels for night signals. We put out water, salt, and hard candy because dehydration makes hands stupid and stupid hands get people killed.

The sun cleared the mesquite and the air went from cool to thick. We moved to the feed store. The tin roof rattled in the small wind. The gravel lot held heat that rose in waves even this early. We parked two trucks nose to nose across the lane and chained the frames tight so a push would move both. We dragged hedgehogs into place and braced them with welded feet. The refinery crew ran beads across weak seams while a generator coughed in the pickup bed. We ran tangle wire in a zigzag and left one narrow lane for our own trucks that we marked with two upside down paint buckets and a strip of reflective tape. We staged a farm sprayer full of dyed diesel behind the loading dock. We stacked pallets to make a shield wall in front of the freezer room, which the lunch ladies turned into a casualty bay with tables and bleach and a box of labeled tourniquets. The principal taped a blank roster to the door and wrote TIME, NAME, INJURY across the top. We put a trash can near the door just for used gloves and another for bloody wraps because those things go everywhere if you let them.

The radio clicked on my chest. “Shale One on approach,” Annie said. “Slow. Boxy. No fins. No paint. Sensor pod keeps moving. No escorts I can see.”

I stepped out to the lane and looked up. The craft came through a high arc like a heavy bird that did not flap. It moved with small corrections from vents on the belly. It had no markings. It had no windows I could see. It emitted a low sound I felt more than heard, a steady pulse that pressed against my chest. It passed over the water tower and banked toward the old interstate cut. Dust rose beneath it in a ribbon.

The radio clicked again. “Shale walkers on the shoulder,” Drew said. “Six at first, two more dropping now. Box on legs. Pattern spacing. They sweep right to left with a little arm on the front. Looks like a probe. No guns that I can see. Might be concealed.”

“They do not know this road,” Mason said on the net. “Hold lines. No sky fire.”

We watched them approach on the scope mounted to a deer blind ladder we had bolted to the feed store wall. The walkers took the ditch with steady steps and tapped the ground ahead with the small arm. They corrected for soft sand and for old rebar that hid in weeds. They moved like soldiers taught to trust a manual. They did not pause to listen. They did not smell the change in the air when the wind shifted off the river. They did not know how water carved the roadside last season. They trusted their map.

I walked the perimeter again. I checked arcs. I checked dead space. I made two men move two feet each to close a gap. I taped a small note to the freezer door that said stop breathing so hard. I felt my hands stop shaking. I felt like I had the first time I lined up hogs in a ravine and waited for the sounder to shift. I kept that thought from my face.

Annie’s voice came again. “Lead walker at the washout. Probe arm taps the culvert lip. Still coming.”

“Hold,” I said. “Let it commit.”

We had set a pressure plate on the downstream side where a foot would slide when it tried to climb. We had poured resin around the edges to keep water from washing it out. The probe arm did not catch it. The foot did. The walker blew both legs and fell forward with a metal squeal and a puff of coolant vapor. The column tightened just like any column does when it sees a friend fall. We put fire on the second and third units with rifles from the ditch and the loading dock. Coolant sprayed in white arcs and then in a dribble. Joints locked and stopped. The fourth tried to step around and punched a foot through a cover we had placed over a pit of T posts set like spikes in concrete buckets. We shot the arm off the one that tried to pull it free. The fifth reversed course and then slipped on the coolant slick and went over on its side. We walked rounds into joints until movement stopped.

“Blue cone,” Drew said. “Overhead.”

A second ship moved above us in a slow circle. It carried a belly lens that threw a soft blue light in a cone. The cone passed over the washout and then over us. It prickled my skin. It did not burn. It did not blast. It marked and moved. I held my fire and so did everyone else. We kept killing what we could touch. The cone moved on and the ship banked toward the river. We tagged it as Fen Eye on the net and ignored it as best we could.

We finished the walkers in our lane. Some tried to crawl. Some tried to right themselves. We used shotguns on the close ones and rifles on the far ones. When moving parts stopped, we pushed forward two pairs to clear the highway cut and make sure nothing lurked in the weeds. We stepped slow with poles and probes. We found three more and killed them with wire and a sledge and a crowbar because we did not waste rounds on things that did not move.

We were getting ready to drag wreckage when Mason called a halt. “High dot,” he said. “Steady as a star. Vyr Three. Do not silhouette. Keep heads low. Finish what you must and then pull to the equipment yard. We reset there.”

I looked up and saw the dot like a small hole in the blue. It did not blink. It did not move. It felt like a camera that did not close. I swallowed and tasted old coffee. The county felt small under that dot. I waved the team to strip the parts we could use and dump the rest in the drainage. We left two men to watch the road while we pulled back to the yard. The sun climbed. The heat came up off the gravel and the smell of hot coolant stuck in my nose.

We ate quick in the shade of a combine that had not run in three years. The lunch ladies handed out peanut butter sandwiches wrapped in foil and bottles of warm water. We chewed and drank and checked gear again. We counted magazines and marked near empty ones with tape. We replaced batteries. We washed grit from eyes with a squeeze bottle. We moved again. No speeches. No talk about right or wrong. We worked.

Before sundown we ran a sweep west of the yard to make sure no stragglers had crawled into barns or culverts. I took six with me. We moved in a staggered line along the fence and used the posts for spacing. We cleared a goat shed and found nothing but feed sacks and a torn tarp. We found a break in the barbed wire where a truck had pushed through months ago. We patched it with tangle wire so we would not forget in the dark. We crossed a shallow creek and the mud tried to keep our boots. We did not hurry. We moved like we were hunting hogs, which is what most of us knew best. We did not speak unless we had to. We used the radio for short breath words. We checked culverts by touching the rims and feeling for vibration. We found none and moved on.

Back in town we set a four person watch on the water tower and rotated them every hour. We set two on the school roof with a green laser to mark targets for the mortars if we had to shoot in the dark. We taped the laser to a broom handle so the operator could keep his head below the lip of the roof. We ran a line from the gym to the generator behind the shop and filled two drums with diesel in case the mains went out. We turned off every light we could find. We put towels at the base of doors to hide the fact that people were inside. We covered street signs with trash bags so any eyes that relied on text would get one more problem to solve. We placed glow sticks in the backs of rooms so anyone looking from the street would think a window reflected the night. We set a signal code for three knocks and a whisper so nobody would shoot a neighbor in the dark.

I took a call from an old man who lived east by the pecan orchard. His voice shook on the radio. He said he saw small shapes moving under his trees. He said they were not raccoons. He said he was alone because his son was in town with us. I told him to fire two shots if anything tried to come inside and to sit in the bathroom with the door locked and the tub full of water. I told him someone would come when we could. He said he would wait. I kept his channel on scan and felt the weight of that promise.

A teenager named Ellie ran courier for us on a dirt bike with the baffles pulled. She wore a helmet too large and a chest rig too small. She carried notes in zip bags in a breadbox bolted to the rear rack. She could ride through a ditch like it was a paved lane. She delivered a sack of batteries and a pocket of ear plugs to the canal post in one run that would have taken a truck four times as long. She came back with a note from Annie that said the washout was quiet except for the ghosts of our own noise bouncing off concrete walls. Ellie asked if she should keep running. I told her yes and to stay off Main unless we set a light for her. She nodded and kicked the bike and vanished down the side street like she was part of the wind.

We used the quiet to plan a push on the cell tower ridge. We thought they might use it as a relay. We had two hunting climbers and enough cable to anchor a man. We loaded a small tool bag with cutters and a pry bar. We sent two up the hill with a third to cover. They moved along the deer trail and used the shadows. At the top they found a new box bolted to the tower base. It had that same leaf ring symbol cut into one side. It hummed with a soft tone you could feel more than hear. They called it in. Mason told them to pull the plug if they could reach it without exposing themselves. They found a service panel and pulled a cable. The tone stopped. They left the box and came back the long way. We marked the spot for later.

We saw people on the far edge of the river fields moving in a loose line. We glassed them from the water tower. They wore suits like the ones we had shot but with brighter shoulder bands. Some carried long tools. They stopped to look at a cow fence like it mattered. They did not hurry. We watched them for ten minutes and then they went back the way they came. We did not chase. We marked the time and moved on. We were not going to get stretched thin by every group that wandered. We had our ground and work to do on it.

Near midnight the wind shifted and the smoke from the decon pod drifted back over town. It clung to the street and hung in the alleys. People began to cough again. A rash broke on my wrist where some had settled when I handled a body earlier. I wiped it with alcohol pads and it burned and then eased. I wrote decon rash on my hand so I would remember to warn the med team. I do not know who they were working to save with that spray. Maybe it was for them. Maybe it was for us. I did not care. We smashed it. They kept dropping more.

We made a sweep through the church and the library because those buildings draw people. We wanted to make sure nobody was hiding inside scared and alone. The church had a smell of old wood and candle wax that the day’s smoke could not take. The library had the air set too cold for the power situation, and we turned it down. We found two teenagers asleep under a table with their rifles across their chests. We woke them and gave them water and sent them to the gym to help. They looked ashamed. I told them to quit that and carry boxes because that was the job right then.

At two in the morning the high dot shifted for the first time. It slid slow toward the west and then back. We watched for a strike that never came. We watched for pods and for skimmers and saw none for a long stretch. Some of us dared to sit for two minutes at a time. Some took off boots and rubbed their feet and put boots back on. You do small things like that when the fight drags. It helps more than you think. I ate a strip of jerky and a cracker and it tasted like salt and dust. I drank warm water and it still did the job.

A little before three we heard a noise like a piano wire plucked, only loud and low. It came from the north field. We went to look and found three stakes with a thin line strung between them at chest height. The line glowed faint in the chem light we held near it. It was not ours. It had small nodes spaced along it and each node flashed with a slow pulse. The refinery crew said it looked like a perimeter marker or a hazard fence. We cut it with a set of insulated cutters and the flash went out. We rolled the line and staked the ends so nobody would faceplant into a trap and break teeth.

At the gym the principal had drawn a grid on poster board and taped it to the wall. Each square had a name or a description. Some had times and little notes. She asked me to read off radio calls for next of kin because her voice had gone hoarse. I read them steady while she wrote. I did not let the names turn into faces. You cannot carry that and still give clear orders. A young man sat on a cot next to his father and breathed in slow counts. He held a pressure bandage with both hands and would not let anyone else touch it. I told him he was doing what the med team needed and to keep it up. He nodded once and kept breathing.

We set up a small line by the rail spur where the grain cars used to sit. We stacked pallets to make a wall and cut shooting holes with a saw. We put two men there with a cooler and a case of water. We told them they were last line if the downtown push went bad. They nodded without talk. They knew what that meant. I checked on them an hour later and they were playing cards by a tiny red light between scans. They looked up and said all quiet. One asked if he should put up a little flag so our people would know who we were in the dark. I told him to keep the red light and forget the flag.

The refinery crew asked for a team to help crack a skimmer core without blowing it. We brought it into the shop with the roll up door closed and two fans running. We pulled the panel and saw a rotor stack and a ring of coils. We pulled the coil harness and it still held charge. We bled it down through a resistor pack and took it apart with non sparking tools. We found a block of memory sealed in resin. We set it in a pan of mineral oil to keep dust off while it cooled. The maker folks grinned in a way I trust because it means they have new problems to solve that might turn into tools.

Close to dawn we got pushed hard on Main. A group of suits came up the side street in a column of twos. They threw small devices that popped and filled the street with dense fog. It did not choke like smoke. It made sound flat and made ranges lie. Our sights swam. We answered with the mortar and a line of shotgun fire to break the push. I saw one of them go down and another pull him by a strap with effort and care. We broke the rest and the fog thinned and then cleared. We found the device that had made it and smashed it with a crowbar and a boot heel. The pieces twitched and then went still.

When the last shots faded, we heard dogs barking at the edge of town. The dogs had been quiet all night, because we had penned them, or tied them to keep them from blowing positions. Now they barked hard at the fields. We went to see. The fields held nothing but dark rows and a light wind. The dogs settled when we stood there. They looked up at us and panted and wagged like the worst of the night was done.

As the sky got pale a man from the next county came down the road on a tractor. He had a shotgun across his lap and a rope on the hitch. He asked if we needed help pulling wrecks from the lane. We said yes. He nodded and set the throttle and got to work without more talk. He did not ask what happened. He looked at Main Street and the black marks and the gear on the ground and he understood enough. He hooked lines and pulled as if it were any other day and any other job. We stacked the wrecks by the quarries so we could strip them later.

By then my hands hurt. My shoulder burned where the stock had beaten me raw. My ears rang in a steady tone. My throat felt like I had swallowed sand. My face itched from dried sweat. My eyes felt like dry marbles. I could still move and I could still think and I could still shoot. That was enough. I walked the block one more time and checked doors and checked roofs and checked alleys. I made sure everyone who should be there was there. I told people to drink. I told them to eat. I told them to sit when they could and to stand when they must.

I stood at the corner and looked down the long street. It was ours again for the moment. We had paid for that with time and blood and pieces of machines piled high. We had not learned a name or a purpose. We had only learned that we could still do the ugly work that keeps a place held. We could break what we had to break. We could hold ground and take ground and give nothing back while breath stayed in us. I do not say that with pride like a speech. It is just true. We did it because we were born here and we know how to work a problem until it stops moving.

We set up on the canal footbridge and the equipment yard that sat behind it. We had ruts deep enough to hide a man. We had piles of scrap to block lines of sight. We had a berm of dirt pushed by a dozer years ago and then left. We wired fishline grenades along the fence and tied the lines low so a step would pull pins. We buried charges in the ruts where a foot would seek balance. We strung monofilament at knee height between two posts so a run would turn into a stumble that turns into a shot. We staged fuel cans and the sprayer to make a wall of fire if they tried to rush the yard. I drew chalk arcs and landmarks on a rusted dozer blade and used my finger to erase and redraw until every lane made sense. I reminded people to take sips and to check each other for heat. Pride does not help when you tip over and leave a hole in the line.

We heard the spider drone before we saw it because it clicked with each step like a dog with long nails on a tile floor. It came low through the grass with a sensor dome up front and a small manipulator gripping a wand. It tapped the ground and waved the wand over spots where our soil had been moved. It paused at a rut and then moved on. It did not find the monofilament because it was clear and still. It did not see the fishline because we had run it through the sage. I tracked it with the bead of a shotgun. When it reached the end of the fence and turned its dome toward the yard, I put a slug through it. It broke into three clean pieces and fell without smoke.

Two tall figures followed the spider. They wore flexible suits with plates where joints would be on a human. Their helmets had a wide face area that showed a pale shape behind the shield. They had long four finger gloves and a chest rig that looked like a medic harness with tubes and packets and symbols that did not match any script I knew. They moved with care. They did not aim weapons at us. They walked to a wrecked walker and tagged it with a little beacon. It chirped and lit a green ring. They turned to drag the wreck into the ditch. I took that as the start of our clock.

“Steady,” I said. “Fire on my call. Three, two, one.”

We opened with rifles and one shotgun slug. The first figure fell to a burst that hit the neck seal and the upper chest. The second turned and reached for a tool on the hip that glowed white at the tip like a welder. Mason put a round through the face shield and the figure dropped like the air went out of a suit. The spider tried to run and I hit it again. We swept the lane with fire until every sensor light on the fallen went dark. We threw smoke and fell back two positions like we had planned it. We did not chase. We let them come into the next lane.

A shape fell from the sky with a small parachute. It was the size of a big cooler and had vents that opened as it landed. It unfolded like a box and started to spray a fine glitter that hung in the air and drifted toward the bodies and the walker pieces. Our meters stayed flat. The refinery crew said it looked like a decon fog that would bind oils and pull them to the ground. Nobody voted to let it run. We put two mortar rounds on it. The second round landed close and flipped the box. The spray stopped. We hosed the debris with diesel from the sprayer and set it alight. The smoke went black and oily. We moved before the wind pushed it back on us.

Six skimmers came low over the canal with a sound like a big swarm of bees. They carried panels on the sides and lenses on the nose. They hit us with light pulses and sound that made my stomach heave and my eyes water. People puked. A kid named Larry dropped his rifle and crawled into a ditch and curled up. I grabbed the sprayer hose and Drew tossed a thermite can on the nearest skimmer. I hosed the intake and engine cowling with fuel and Drew lit the flare. The skimmer flamed and went nose down into the canal. The rest banked off and came again from another angle. We learned fast to shoot for the panels that pivoted. A pivot binds and a skimmer turns into a lawn dart.

We saw a ground squad on the far side of the canal. They had shoulder lights that blinked in a pattern and they held their hands up with palms out. They moved in a straight line like a training film. They came slow like they wanted to show they were not a threat, or like they were trying to talk with the lights. I ordered fire. We broke them at thirty yards with rifles and buckshot. They fell without screams. Our breathing was what we heard. Brass hit gravel. Someone coughed and spit and went back to sighting in.

We pushed through the drainage to make sure they did not regroup. The mud sucked at boots. The heat came off the water like a breath. I stepped on a soft pack near one of the tall suits. It split and out spilled sealant vials, bandage foil, and a small printed icon of a planet with a ring of leaves. It looked like a medical symbol or a relief badge. I did not call it in. I kicked the pack into the water and watched it sink and then I kept moving. I told myself I did not have time to think about symbols. I told myself that work comes first.

We pulled back to the yard and restocked. We rotated shooters to water and shade and shoved salt into pockets. The lunch ladies brought out cut fruit and saltines and cups of sweet tea and told people to sit for five minutes and then get back out. The refinery crew cleaned the mortars and cut more fins. The school bus made a run to the gym with two wounded who would live and one who might not. We worked the list like a harvest day. We were not kind and we were not cruel. We did what had to be done to keep the line from breaking.

The radio carried a new tone that meant new eyes. “Vyr Three has not moved,” Annie said. “Still high. Fen Eye widened orbit. Shale One is on the deck again two miles west. Keep heads down. Expect a probe for their dead.”

We did not have to wait long. Small pods dropped into fields and alleys with no blast and no heat. They rolled and then settled. They opened like clams and hummed. They launched beetle machines the size of a dinner plate with three legs and a clamp. The beetles went to the fallen and the wrecks and started to drag them toward the pods. They ignored us until we stepped close. Then they tried to scuttle away. We stomped them. We hit them with shovels. One woman smashed a pod window with a tire iron and split her knuckles, then lit the pod with a rag in a diesel can. The glass writhed as if something moved in the layers. Nobody looked too close. We tipped the pod on its side and left it to burn out, then moved to the next block because the sound of the beetles drew more of them.

We held the yard through afternoon. We shot at shapes and lenses and pods. We pushed back when we had to. We dragged our own wounded to the freezer room and packed wounds with gauze and pressed hands until bleeding slowed. We stacked used tourniquets in a bucket so we could wash the ones that could be washed. We used new ones when we had to. We wrote times on foreheads with a marker so the med team could see how long a band was on. We put the dead in a side room behind the ice machine because the gym did not have space and we needed the freezer room for the living.

As the light faded, we shifted to downtown. We wanted to push them off Main Street and break any transmitters they had hidden in buildings. We set a bait pickup in the intersection with the radio on the seat and a Bible on the dash because a lot of folks leave one there and we wanted it to look normal. We strung a block party of cinder blocks and logs to channel foot traffic. We put shooters in the post office doorway and the hardware store roof access and the alley behind the diner. We killed the lights. The street took on that quiet that means everything is listening.

Night changed the rules. Vyr Three hung high like a cold moon. It painted thin lines across pasture and road. Where the lines crossed, electronics died. Our night vision goggles flickered and went black. Our flashlights failed if we clicked them near the lines. We learned to stand outside the cross and use chem lights and iron sights. We learned to move by shoulder taps and breath counts. We kept shooting first because hesitation gets people killed.

They came to rescue. Soft pods dropped without shock into side streets and yards. Each pod hummed and sent beetles to collect the fallen and the broken gear. Beetles dragged bodies by straps toward the open doors. We broke beetles with boots and shovels. One woman put a railroad spike through a beetle body with a sledge and the tool stuck. She kicked it free and went to the next. We did not allow them to take their dead because that was the rule we had made. I do not know why we made that rule, but we did. Maybe it was to deny them a count. Maybe it was because people around here bury their own. The reason does not matter when your hands are full of work.

The gym filled fast. The lunch ladies cut shirts with kitchen shears and packed wounds. They stacked triage tags with rubber bands. The principal wrote names as people could say them. Sometimes she wrote a description when no name came. One old rancher died with a calm look and an empty magazine across his lap. We reloaded his pockets because even the dead have work and we could not leave an old man light. A girl asked me if she could go home. Her hands shook so hard she could not thread a tourniquet through its buckle. I taped two of her fingers together so she could run it again. She nodded like I had given her something worth more than a medal and went back to the line.

The bait pickup idled in the intersection and made a warm spot in the air. Shale bipeds approached in a wedge with their shoulder lights dim and their hands up. One raised both hands higher and let out a low tone that rose and fell. Mason shot him clean in the chest. I followed to the right and put rounds into the center of the wedge. The rest of our shooters raked the wedge and put them down. We lit the pickup and shoved it with a tractor to block the road and hide our movement. We moved again before they could paint us from above.

On the edge of town, a group of them knelt around a tripod that pointed up. It did not point at us. It sent a tight beam toward Vyr Three. The beam looked like nothing. It had no color I could see. It made no heat. We shelled the tripod with two mortar rounds and then finished the rest with the backhoe bucket because it was close and solid and did not jam. Their hands were wrapped around each other and not around any weapon. We did not wait to ask why. We marked the spot with a tire so we would not waste more shells there.

By midnight the ground was slick with spilled coolant and fuel and blood. The buildings took hits from skimmers that tried to herd us. We learned to wait for the strobe and then move after it because the sound pulse hit late. We learned to aim at the base of the strobe, not the light, because that is where the lens sits. We put two skimmers down with buckshot when they came too low, and we stripped panels for later because panel edges make a good blade. We found a boy prying one with a screwdriver while rounds cracked a block away. I took the tool from him and walked him to the gym and set him to carrying water. He looked at the floor and nodded and did the job. Sometimes that is how you save a kid. You give them something to lift that is not a rifle.

Toward dawn the attacks slowed. Pods still came, but fewer. The high dot drifted a little and then steadied again. Fen Eye widened its circle and left our block for a pass near the river. We used the break to run a convoy of wounded to the gym. The school bus rolled with the doors tied back and the lights off. Inside the gym the air stank of sweat and solvent and copper. The lunch ladies sat on the steps with shoes off and eyes that looked like old glass. They had not slept. They had not sat until now. The principal took the roster from her lap and placed it beside her like it might roll away.

Mason counted brass. He did not count bodies. He stacked casings by caliber and weight. He told me it was easier to plan resupply that way. I said that made sense and then I realized he was doing it so he would not have to list names and feel the count change from brass to people. I let him keep doing it. The principal still wrote on the pad. Her handwriting stayed neat. She asked for a new pen when the ink went thin. Someone found one in a desk and handed it to her like a medal. She nodded and kept writing.

I walked home when the sky went gray and the sounds thinned. The fields were black with soot and the road was scarred. The porch steps creaked like always. The shotgun leaned where it always leaned. My boots were muddy and my hands smelled like solvent and smoke. I sat and drank coffee that had turned bitter and cold. I watched a crow sit on the fence and then fly off when a truck backfired down the lane. I thought about the sealant packets and the printed planet icon with the ring of leaves. I thought about the open palms and the shoulder lights that blinked in a pattern that might have been speech. I thought about the blue cone that painted us and then moved on. I thought about how none of that changed the way the night went.

I looked at the road and chewed on a piece of straw and felt pride and heat and the quiet that comes after hard work. I felt the truth of what we had just done settle on me like dust after cattle move through a pen. We held. We hurt them. We told each other that this is how you live when your land is marked by eyes in the sky and boots on the ground that are not yours. We told each other we would do it again if the dot comes back, and it will.

I will not dress this up as wisdom. I will not say I know what they wanted. I know we did not ask. We saw machines and suits and boxes and lights. We saw our roads and our stores and our barns. We saw strangers on them. We did what our kind does. We fight until the job is done or we are gone. We do not stop because someone raises open hands. We do not stop because a beam points at the sky instead of our chest. We work the problem in front of us and the problem after that.

When the coffee ran out, I set the mug down and rubbed grit from my eyes. The high dot was gone. The skimmers were gone. The soft pods were dead metal in ditches. Our people slept in rows. The lunch ladies sat with their backs to the gym wall and their heads tipped forward. The principal put the pad in her lap and closed her eyes. Mason stacked the last pile of brass and tied it in a rag. The county got quiet again. Not safe. Just quiet now, again.

I went inside and washed my hands. The water ran gray and then clear. I came back out and sat because that is what I do when the jobs are done for a minute. I thought about the next pass and the next line and the next time we would block a road and turn a street into a long trap. I thought about the way the suit fell when a round broke the face shield. I thought about the way the beetles kept working until you crushed the last leg. I thought about the way the lunch ladies kept cutting and packing and telling people to breathe.

We might be a bunch of stubborn ornery humans, but when it comes down to it don't mess with us, but one thought crossed his mind. We never asked the aliens, if they had really come to Earth to fight

I try my best for real dynamics but as we all know, people are people. 

I honestly just have questions and would like any advice you may have regarding budgeting. What percentage of income do you set aside for your goddess? 
How do you go about it in the sense of do you structure weekly, monthly? What has worked and what hasn’t in the past? Do you have separate budgets for games, gifts, coffee sends etc.? 

Thank you !

1pmixmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SciFiTime/comments/1pmixmi/we_fought_the_aliens_but_never_asked_why_they_came/,"We Fought the Aliens, But Never Asked Why They Came","I woke before the alarms because the air felt wrong and the ground carried a small hum through the floorboards. I dressed by habit. Boots, belt, rifle sling, med pouch, ear protection in a pocket, gloves through the rear loop. I stepped onto the porch and tasted dust. The sky was a cold line in the east with a smear of smoke that was not from any field burn I knew. I sat for a minute and chewed a dry piece of straw and kept my hands still so I would not shake. I looked at the old shotgun leaning by the railing and left it where it was because today called for reach and control, not comfort. I took the AR, worked the bolt, and checked the chamber. I checked the tourniquet rubber banded to the stock, the pressure bandage in the pouch, and the spare batteries in a film can. I put on ear pro and felt heavier, which always helps.

Trucks rolled in on the gravel in a steady rhythm. County rigs, ranch flatbeds, a refinery pickup with a welder bolted to the bed, a school bus with the word BAND painted over in brown house paint. People climbed out and kept their voices low. Old Guard vets from two wars back. Farmhands with fencing pliers on their belts. Refinery mechanics with burns on their sleeves. Lunch ladies from the school still in sneakers. The school principal with a clipboard and a pistol in an old holster. Mason took the center like he always did when something had to move without drama. He wore a plain shirt and kept a pencil behind his ear. He unrolled a county map on my truck hood and held it with a socket set and a jar of nails.

“We split three ways,” he said. “Roadblock at the washout. Kill box at the feed store. Flank element along the canal. Reserve holds here and runs resupply and med shuttle. Holden takes the feed store. Annie runs the washout. Drew takes the canal. Radios stay short. No sky fire unless we can mark a lock and call it twice. Nobody plays hero. We finish what we start and we leave before their revenge pass.”

I walked my team through a fast check. Rifles, bolts wet, mags seated. Shotguns for the close spots. A handful of hunting rifles with glass. Two homemade mortars with coffee can charges and fuses taped into rubber tube. We had starboard and port hand signals because half the people could not hear well anymore, and shouting would only draw eyes. We loaded hedgehogs made from rebar triangles and welded plate. We stacked sandbags and filled them with a mix of sand and feed corn to add weight. We cut tangle wire and rolled it on broom handles so it would deploy without a fight. We dragged old road signs to use as shields. We taped red chem lights to the inside of barrels for night signals. We put out water, salt, and hard candy because dehydration makes hands stupid and stupid hands get people killed.

The sun cleared the mesquite and the air went from cool to thick. We moved to the feed store. The tin roof rattled in the small wind. The gravel lot held heat that rose in waves even this early. We parked two trucks nose to nose across the lane and chained the frames tight so a push would move both. We dragged hedgehogs into place and braced them with welded feet. The refinery crew ran beads across weak seams while a generator coughed in the pickup bed. We ran tangle wire in a zigzag and left one narrow lane for our own trucks that we marked with two upside down paint buckets and a strip of reflective tape. We staged a farm sprayer full of dyed diesel behind the loading dock. We stacked pallets to make a shield wall in front of the freezer room, which the lunch ladies turned into a casualty bay with tables and bleach and a box of labeled tourniquets. The principal taped a blank roster to the door and wrote TIME, NAME, INJURY across the top. We put a trash can near the door just for used gloves and another for bloody wraps because those things go everywhere if you let them.

The radio clicked on my chest. “Shale One on approach,” Annie said. “Slow. Boxy. No fins. No paint. Sensor pod keeps moving. No escorts I can see.”

I stepped out to the lane and looked up. The craft came through a high arc like a heavy bird that did not flap. It moved with small corrections from vents on the belly. It had no markings. It had no windows I could see. It emitted a low sound I felt more than heard, a steady pulse that pressed against my chest. It passed over the water tower and banked toward the old interstate cut. Dust rose beneath it in a ribbon.

The radio clicked again. “Shale walkers on the shoulder,” Drew said. “Six at first, two more dropping now. Box on legs. Pattern spacing. They sweep right to left with a little arm on the front. Looks like a probe. No guns that I can see. Might be concealed.”

“They do not know this road,” Mason said on the net. “Hold lines. No sky fire.”

We watched them approach on the scope mounted to a deer blind ladder we had bolted to the feed store wall. The walkers took the ditch with steady steps and tapped the ground ahead with the small arm. They corrected for soft sand and for old rebar that hid in weeds. They moved like soldiers taught to trust a manual. They did not pause to listen. They did not smell the change in the air when the wind shifted off the river. They did not know how water carved the roadside last season. They trusted their map.

I walked the perimeter again. I checked arcs. I checked dead space. I made two men move two feet each to close a gap. I taped a small note to the freezer door that said stop breathing so hard. I felt my hands stop shaking. I felt like I had the first time I lined up hogs in a ravine and waited for the sounder to shift. I kept that thought from my face.

Annie’s voice came again. “Lead walker at the washout. Probe arm taps the culvert lip. Still coming.”

“Hold,” I said. “Let it commit.”

We had set a pressure plate on the downstream side where a foot would slide when it tried to climb. We had poured resin around the edges to keep water from washing it out. The probe arm did not catch it. The foot did. The walker blew both legs and fell forward with a metal squeal and a puff of coolant vapor. The column tightened just like any column does when it sees a friend fall. We put fire on the second and third units with rifles from the ditch and the loading dock. Coolant sprayed in white arcs and then in a dribble. Joints locked and stopped. The fourth tried to step around and punched a foot through a cover we had placed over a pit of T posts set like spikes in concrete buckets. We shot the arm off the one that tried to pull it free. The fifth reversed course and then slipped on the coolant slick and went over on its side. We walked rounds into joints until movement stopped.

“Blue cone,” Drew said. “Overhead.”

A second ship moved above us in a slow circle. It carried a belly lens that threw a soft blue light in a cone. The cone passed over the washout and then over us. It prickled my skin. It did not burn. It did not blast. It marked and moved. I held my fire and so did everyone else. We kept killing what we could touch. The cone moved on and the ship banked toward the river. We tagged it as Fen Eye on the net and ignored it as best we could.

We finished the walkers in our lane. Some tried to crawl. Some tried to right themselves. We used shotguns on the close ones and rifles on the far ones. When moving parts stopped, we pushed forward two pairs to clear the highway cut and make sure nothing lurked in the weeds. We stepped slow with poles and probes. We found three more and killed them with wire and a sledge and a crowbar because we did not waste rounds on things that did not move.

We were getting ready to drag wreckage when Mason called a halt. “High dot,” he said. “Steady as a star. Vyr Three. Do not silhouette. Keep heads low. Finish what you must and then pull to the equipment yard. We reset there.”

I looked up and saw the dot like a small hole in the blue. It did not blink. It did not move. It felt like a camera that did not close. I swallowed and tasted old coffee. The county felt small under that dot. I waved the team to strip the parts we could use and dump the rest in the drainage. We left two men to watch the road while we pulled back to the yard. The sun climbed. The heat came up off the gravel and the smell of hot coolant stuck in my nose.

We ate quick in the shade of a combine that had not run in three years. The lunch ladies handed out peanut butter sandwiches wrapped in foil and bottles of warm water. We chewed and drank and checked gear again. We counted magazines and marked near empty ones with tape. We replaced batteries. We washed grit from eyes with a squeeze bottle. We moved again. No speeches. No talk about right or wrong. We worked.

Before sundown we ran a sweep west of the yard to make sure no stragglers had crawled into barns or culverts. I took six with me. We moved in a staggered line along the fence and used the posts for spacing. We cleared a goat shed and found nothing but feed sacks and a torn tarp. We found a break in the barbed wire where a truck had pushed through months ago. We patched it with tangle wire so we would not forget in the dark. We crossed a shallow creek and the mud tried to keep our boots. We did not hurry. We moved like we were hunting hogs, which is what most of us knew best. We did not speak unless we had to. We used the radio for short breath words. We checked culverts by touching the rims and feeling for vibration. We found none and moved on.

Back in town we set a four person watch on the water tower and rotated them every hour. We set two on the school roof with a green laser to mark targets for the mortars if we had to shoot in the dark. We taped the laser to a broom handle so the operator could keep his head below the lip of the roof. We ran a line from the gym to the generator behind the shop and filled two drums with diesel in case the mains went out. We turned off every light we could find. We put towels at the base of doors to hide the fact that people were inside. We covered street signs with trash bags so any eyes that relied on text would get one more problem to solve. We placed glow sticks in the backs of rooms so anyone looking from the street would think a window reflected the night. We set a signal code for three knocks and a whisper so nobody would shoot a neighbor in the dark.

I took a call from an old man who lived east by the pecan orchard. His voice shook on the radio. He said he saw small shapes moving under his trees. He said they were not raccoons. He said he was alone because his son was in town with us. I told him to fire two shots if anything tried to come inside and to sit in the bathroom with the door locked and the tub full of water. I told him someone would come when we could. He said he would wait. I kept his channel on scan and felt the weight of that promise.

A teenager named Ellie ran courier for us on a dirt bike with the baffles pulled. She wore a helmet too large and a chest rig too small. She carried notes in zip bags in a breadbox bolted to the rear rack. She could ride through a ditch like it was a paved lane. She delivered a sack of batteries and a pocket of ear plugs to the canal post in one run that would have taken a truck four times as long. She came back with a note from Annie that said the washout was quiet except for the ghosts of our own noise bouncing off concrete walls. Ellie asked if she should keep running. I told her yes and to stay off Main unless we set a light for her. She nodded and kicked the bike and vanished down the side street like she was part of the wind.

We used the quiet to plan a push on the cell tower ridge. We thought they might use it as a relay. We had two hunting climbers and enough cable to anchor a man. We loaded a small tool bag with cutters and a pry bar. We sent two up the hill with a third to cover. They moved along the deer trail and used the shadows. At the top they found a new box bolted to the tower base. It had that same leaf ring symbol cut into one side. It hummed with a soft tone you could feel more than hear. They called it in. Mason told them to pull the plug if they could reach it without exposing themselves. They found a service panel and pulled a cable. The tone stopped. They left the box and came back the long way. We marked the spot for later.

We saw people on the far edge of the river fields moving in a loose line. We glassed them from the water tower. They wore suits like the ones we had shot but with brighter shoulder bands. Some carried long tools. They stopped to look at a cow fence like it mattered. They did not hurry. We watched them for ten minutes and then they went back the way they came. We did not chase. We marked the time and moved on. We were not going to get stretched thin by every group that wandered. We had our ground and work to do on it.

Near midnight the wind shifted and the smoke from the decon pod drifted back over town. It clung to the street and hung in the alleys. People began to cough again. A rash broke on my wrist where some had settled when I handled a body earlier. I wiped it with alcohol pads and it burned and then eased. I wrote decon rash on my hand so I would remember to warn the med team. I do not know who they were working to save with that spray. Maybe it was for them. Maybe it was for us. I did not care. We smashed it. They kept dropping more.

We made a sweep through the church and the library because those buildings draw people. We wanted to make sure nobody was hiding inside scared and alone. The church had a smell of old wood and candle wax that the day’s smoke could not take. The library had the air set too cold for the power situation, and we turned it down. We found two teenagers asleep under a table with their rifles across their chests. We woke them and gave them water and sent them to the gym to help. They looked ashamed. I told them to quit that and carry boxes because that was the job right then.

At two in the morning the high dot shifted for the first time. It slid slow toward the west and then back. We watched for a strike that never came. We watched for pods and for skimmers and saw none for a long stretch. Some of us dared to sit for two minutes at a time. Some took off boots and rubbed their feet and put boots back on. You do small things like that when the fight drags. It helps more than you think. I ate a strip of jerky and a cracker and it tasted like salt and dust. I drank warm water and it still did the job.

A little before three we heard a noise like a piano wire plucked, only loud and low. It came from the north field. We went to look and found three stakes with a thin line strung between them at chest height. The line glowed faint in the chem light we held near it. It was not ours. It had small nodes spaced along it and each node flashed with a slow pulse. The refinery crew said it looked like a perimeter marker or a hazard fence. We cut it with a set of insulated cutters and the flash went out. We rolled the line and staked the ends so nobody would faceplant into a trap and break teeth.

At the gym the principal had drawn a grid on poster board and taped it to the wall. Each square had a name or a description. Some had times and little notes. She asked me to read off radio calls for next of kin because her voice had gone hoarse. I read them steady while she wrote. I did not let the names turn into faces. You cannot carry that and still give clear orders. A young man sat on a cot next to his father and breathed in slow counts. He held a pressure bandage with both hands and would not let anyone else touch it. I told him he was doing what the med team needed and to keep it up. He nodded once and kept breathing.

We set up a small line by the rail spur where the grain cars used to sit. We stacked pallets to make a wall and cut shooting holes with a saw. We put two men there with a cooler and a case of water. We told them they were last line if the downtown push went bad. They nodded without talk. They knew what that meant. I checked on them an hour later and they were playing cards by a tiny red light between scans. They looked up and said all quiet. One asked if he should put up a little flag so our people would know who we were in the dark. I told him to keep the red light and forget the flag.

The refinery crew asked for a team to help crack a skimmer core without blowing it. We brought it into the shop with the roll up door closed and two fans running. We pulled the panel and saw a rotor stack and a ring of coils. We pulled the coil harness and it still held charge. We bled it down through a resistor pack and took it apart with non sparking tools. We found a block of memory sealed in resin. We set it in a pan of mineral oil to keep dust off while it cooled. The maker folks grinned in a way I trust because it means they have new problems to solve that might turn into tools.

Close to dawn we got pushed hard on Main. A group of suits came up the side street in a column of twos. They threw small devices that popped and filled the street with dense fog. It did not choke like smoke. It made sound flat and made ranges lie. Our sights swam. We answered with the mortar and a line of shotgun fire to break the push. I saw one of them go down and another pull him by a strap with effort and care. We broke the rest and the fog thinned and then cleared. We found the device that had made it and smashed it with a crowbar and a boot heel. The pieces twitched and then went still.

When the last shots faded, we heard dogs barking at the edge of town. The dogs had been quiet all night, because we had penned them, or tied them to keep them from blowing positions. Now they barked hard at the fields. We went to see. The fields held nothing but dark rows and a light wind. The dogs settled when we stood there. They looked up at us and panted and wagged like the worst of the night was done.

As the sky got pale a man from the next county came down the road on a tractor. He had a shotgun across his lap and a rope on the hitch. He asked if we needed help pulling wrecks from the lane. We said yes. He nodded and set the throttle and got to work without more talk. He did not ask what happened. He looked at Main Street and the black marks and the gear on the ground and he understood enough. He hooked lines and pulled as if it were any other day and any other job. We stacked the wrecks by the quarries so we could strip them later.

By then my hands hurt. My shoulder burned where the stock had beaten me raw. My ears rang in a steady tone. My throat felt like I had swallowed sand. My face itched from dried sweat. My eyes felt like dry marbles. I could still move and I could still think and I could still shoot. That was enough. I walked the block one more time and checked doors and checked roofs and checked alleys. I made sure everyone who should be there was there. I told people to drink. I told them to eat. I told them to sit when they could and to stand when they must.

I stood at the corner and looked down the long street. It was ours again for the moment. We had paid for that with time and blood and pieces of machines piled high. We had not learned a name or a purpose. We had only learned that we could still do the ugly work that keeps a place held. We could break what we had to break. We could hold ground and take ground and give nothing back while breath stayed in us. I do not say that with pride like a speech. It is just true. We did it because we were born here and we know how to work a problem until it stops moving.

We set up on the canal footbridge and the equipment yard that sat behind it. We had ruts deep enough to hide a man. We had piles of scrap to block lines of sight. We had a berm of dirt pushed by a dozer years ago and then left. We wired fishline grenades along the fence and tied the lines low so a step would pull pins. We buried charges in the ruts where a foot would seek balance. We strung monofilament at knee height between two posts so a run would turn into a stumble that turns into a shot. We staged fuel cans and the sprayer to make a wall of fire if they tried to rush the yard. I drew chalk arcs and landmarks on a rusted dozer blade and used my finger to erase and redraw until every lane made sense. I reminded people to take sips and to check each other for heat. Pride does not help when you tip over and leave a hole in the line.

We heard the spider drone before we saw it because it clicked with each step like a dog with long nails on a tile floor. It came low through the grass with a sensor dome up front and a small manipulator gripping a wand. It tapped the ground and waved the wand over spots where our soil had been moved. It paused at a rut and then moved on. It did not find the monofilament because it was clear and still. It did not see the fishline because we had run it through the sage. I tracked it with the bead of a shotgun. When it reached the end of the fence and turned its dome toward the yard, I put a slug through it. It broke into three clean pieces and fell without smoke.

Two tall figures followed the spider. They wore flexible suits with plates where joints would be on a human. Their helmets had a wide face area that showed a pale shape behind the shield. They had long four finger gloves and a chest rig that looked like a medic harness with tubes and packets and symbols that did not match any script I knew. They moved with care. They did not aim weapons at us. They walked to a wrecked walker and tagged it with a little beacon. It chirped and lit a green ring. They turned to drag the wreck into the ditch. I took that as the start of our clock.

“Steady,” I said. “Fire on my call. Three, two, one.”

We opened with rifles and one shotgun slug. The first figure fell to a burst that hit the neck seal and the upper chest. The second turned and reached for a tool on the hip that glowed white at the tip like a welder. Mason put a round through the face shield and the figure dropped like the air went out of a suit. The spider tried to run and I hit it again. We swept the lane with fire until every sensor light on the fallen went dark. We threw smoke and fell back two positions like we had planned it. We did not chase. We let them come into the next lane.

A shape fell from the sky with a small parachute. It was the size of a big cooler and had vents that opened as it landed. It unfolded like a box and started to spray a fine glitter that hung in the air and drifted toward the bodies and the walker pieces. Our meters stayed flat. The refinery crew said it looked like a decon fog that would bind oils and pull them to the ground. Nobody voted to let it run. We put two mortar rounds on it. The second round landed close and flipped the box. The spray stopped. We hosed the debris with diesel from the sprayer and set it alight. The smoke went black and oily. We moved before the wind pushed it back on us.

Six skimmers came low over the canal with a sound like a big swarm of bees. They carried panels on the sides and lenses on the nose. They hit us with light pulses and sound that made my stomach heave and my eyes water. People puked. A kid named Larry dropped his rifle and crawled into a ditch and curled up. I grabbed the sprayer hose and Drew tossed a thermite can on the nearest skimmer. I hosed the intake and engine cowling with fuel and Drew lit the flare. The skimmer flamed and went nose down into the canal. The rest banked off and came again from another angle. We learned fast to shoot for the panels that pivoted. A pivot binds and a skimmer turns into a lawn dart.

We saw a ground squad on the far side of the canal. They had shoulder lights that blinked in a pattern and they held their hands up with palms out. They moved in a straight line like a training film. They came slow like they wanted to show they were not a threat, or like they were trying to talk with the lights. I ordered fire. We broke them at thirty yards with rifles and buckshot. They fell without screams. Our breathing was what we heard. Brass hit gravel. Someone coughed and spit and went back to sighting in.

We pushed through the drainage to make sure they did not regroup. The mud sucked at boots. The heat came off the water like a breath. I stepped on a soft pack near one of the tall suits. It split and out spilled sealant vials, bandage foil, and a small printed icon of a planet with a ring of leaves. It looked like a medical symbol or a relief badge. I did not call it in. I kicked the pack into the water and watched it sink and then I kept moving. I told myself I did not have time to think about symbols. I told myself that work comes first.

We pulled back to the yard and restocked. We rotated shooters to water and shade and shoved salt into pockets. The lunch ladies brought out cut fruit and saltines and cups of sweet tea and told people to sit for five minutes and then get back out. The refinery crew cleaned the mortars and cut more fins. The school bus made a run to the gym with two wounded who would live and one who might not. We worked the list like a harvest day. We were not kind and we were not cruel. We did what had to be done to keep the line from breaking.

The radio carried a new tone that meant new eyes. “Vyr Three has not moved,” Annie said. “Still high. Fen Eye widened orbit. Shale One is on the deck again two miles west. Keep heads down. Expect a probe for their dead.”

We did not have to wait long. Small pods dropped into fields and alleys with no blast and no heat. They rolled and then settled. They opened like clams and hummed. They launched beetle machines the size of a dinner plate with three legs and a clamp. The beetles went to the fallen and the wrecks and started to drag them toward the pods. They ignored us until we stepped close. Then they tried to scuttle away. We stomped them. We hit them with shovels. One woman smashed a pod window with a tire iron and split her knuckles, then lit the pod with a rag in a diesel can. The glass writhed as if something moved in the layers. Nobody looked too close. We tipped the pod on its side and left it to burn out, then moved to the next block because the sound of the beetles drew more of them.

We held the yard through afternoon. We shot at shapes and lenses and pods. We pushed back when we had to. We dragged our own wounded to the freezer room and packed wounds with gauze and pressed hands until bleeding slowed. We stacked used tourniquets in a bucket so we could wash the ones that could be washed. We used new ones when we had to. We wrote times on foreheads with a marker so the med team could see how long a band was on. We put the dead in a side room behind the ice machine because the gym did not have space and we needed the freezer room for the living.

As the light faded, we shifted to downtown. We wanted to push them off Main Street and break any transmitters they had hidden in buildings. We set a bait pickup in the intersection with the radio on the seat and a Bible on the dash because a lot of folks leave one there and we wanted it to look normal. We strung a block party of cinder blocks and logs to channel foot traffic. We put shooters in the post office doorway and the hardware store roof access and the alley behind the diner. We killed the lights. The street took on that quiet that means everything is listening.

Night changed the rules. Vyr Three hung high like a cold moon. It painted thin lines across pasture and road. Where the lines crossed, electronics died. Our night vision goggles flickered and went black. Our flashlights failed if we clicked them near the lines. We learned to stand outside the cross and use chem lights and iron sights. We learned to move by shoulder taps and breath counts. We kept shooting first because hesitation gets people killed.

They came to rescue. Soft pods dropped without shock into side streets and yards. Each pod hummed and sent beetles to collect the fallen and the broken gear. Beetles dragged bodies by straps toward the open doors. We broke beetles with boots and shovels. One woman put a railroad spike through a beetle body with a sledge and the tool stuck. She kicked it free and went to the next. We did not allow them to take their dead because that was the rule we had made. I do not know why we made that rule, but we did. Maybe it was to deny them a count. Maybe it was because people around here bury their own. The reason does not matter when your hands are full of work.

The gym filled fast. The lunch ladies cut shirts with kitchen shears and packed wounds. They stacked triage tags with rubber bands. The principal wrote names as people could say them. Sometimes she wrote a description when no name came. One old rancher died with a calm look and an empty magazine across his lap. We reloaded his pockets because even the dead have work and we could not leave an old man light. A girl asked me if she could go home. Her hands shook so hard she could not thread a tourniquet through its buckle. I taped two of her fingers together so she could run it again. She nodded like I had given her something worth more than a medal and went back to the line.

The bait pickup idled in the intersection and made a warm spot in the air. Shale bipeds approached in a wedge with their shoulder lights dim and their hands up. One raised both hands higher and let out a low tone that rose and fell. Mason shot him clean in the chest. I followed to the right and put rounds into the center of the wedge. The rest of our shooters raked the wedge and put them down. We lit the pickup and shoved it with a tractor to block the road and hide our movement. We moved again before they could paint us from above.

On the edge of town, a group of them knelt around a tripod that pointed up. It did not point at us. It sent a tight beam toward Vyr Three. The beam looked like nothing. It had no color I could see. It made no heat. We shelled the tripod with two mortar rounds and then finished the rest with the backhoe bucket because it was close and solid and did not jam. Their hands were wrapped around each other and not around any weapon. We did not wait to ask why. We marked the spot with a tire so we would not waste more shells there.

By midnight the ground was slick with spilled coolant and fuel and blood. The buildings took hits from skimmers that tried to herd us. We learned to wait for the strobe and then move after it because the sound pulse hit late. We learned to aim at the base of the strobe, not the light, because that is where the lens sits. We put two skimmers down with buckshot when they came too low, and we stripped panels for later because panel edges make a good blade. We found a boy prying one with a screwdriver while rounds cracked a block away. I took the tool from him and walked him to the gym and set him to carrying water. He looked at the floor and nodded and did the job. Sometimes that is how you save a kid. You give them something to lift that is not a rifle.

Toward dawn the attacks slowed. Pods still came, but fewer. The high dot drifted a little and then steadied again. Fen Eye widened its circle and left our block for a pass near the river. We used the break to run a convoy of wounded to the gym. The school bus rolled with the doors tied back and the lights off. Inside the gym the air stank of sweat and solvent and copper. The lunch ladies sat on the steps with shoes off and eyes that looked like old glass. They had not slept. They had not sat until now. The principal took the roster from her lap and placed it beside her like it might roll away.

Mason counted brass. He did not count bodies. He stacked casings by caliber and weight. He told me it was easier to plan resupply that way. I said that made sense and then I realized he was doing it so he would not have to list names and feel the count change from brass to people. I let him keep doing it. The principal still wrote on the pad. Her handwriting stayed neat. She asked for a new pen when the ink went thin. Someone found one in a desk and handed it to her like a medal. She nodded and kept writing.

I walked home when the sky went gray and the sounds thinned. The fields were black with soot and the road was scarred. The porch steps creaked like always. The shotgun leaned where it always leaned. My boots were muddy and my hands smelled like solvent and smoke. I sat and drank coffee that had turned bitter and cold. I watched a crow sit on the fence and then fly off when a truck backfired down the lane. I thought about the sealant packets and the printed planet icon with the ring of leaves. I thought about the open palms and the shoulder lights that blinked in a pattern that might have been speech. I thought about the blue cone that painted us and then moved on. I thought about how none of that changed the way the night went.

I looked at the road and chewed on a piece of straw and felt pride and heat and the quiet that comes after hard work. I felt the truth of what we had just done settle on me like dust after cattle move through a pen. We held. We hurt them. We told each other that this is how you live when your land is marked by eyes in the sky and boots on the ground that are not yours. We told each other we would do it again if the dot comes back, and it will.

I will not dress this up as wisdom. I will not say I know what they wanted. I know we did not ask. We saw machines and suits and boxes and lights. We saw our roads and our stores and our barns. We saw strangers on them. We did what our kind does. We fight until the job is done or we are gone. We do not stop because someone raises open hands. We do not stop because a beam points at the sky instead of our chest. We work the problem in front of us and the problem after that.

When the coffee ran out, I set the mug down and rubbed grit from my eyes. The high dot was gone. The skimmers were gone. The soft pods were dead metal in ditches. Our people slept in rows. The lunch ladies sat with their backs to the gym wall and their heads tipped forward. The principal put the pad in her lap and closed her eyes. Mason stacked the last pile of brass and tied it in a rag. The county got quiet again. Not safe. Just quiet now, again.

I went inside and washed my hands. The water ran gray and then clear. I came back out and sat because that is what I do when the jobs are done for a minute. I thought about the next pass and the next line and the next time we would block a road and turn a street into a long trap. I thought about the way the suit fell when a round broke the face shield. I thought about the way the beetles kept working until you crushed the last leg. I thought about the way the lunch ladies kept cutting and packing and telling people to breathe.

We might be a bunch of stubborn ornery humans, but when it comes down to it don't mess with us, but one thought crossed his mind. We never asked the aliens, if they had really come to Earth to fight

How could I forget the first time I saw the River King?

It was a gloomy day in early spring. The remnants of the winter snowfalls lay hard and half-melted by rains; the air smelled of wet leaves, and I was eight years old. I was visiting my cousins in the country, and aside from the long car ride through rained-streaked highways and the juice boxes bought for me at gas stations along the way, I was not enjoying my visit. All of my cousins were many years my senior, all of them hated me for cramping their style with my awkward presence, and the grown ups were too caught up in their wine and catchings-up to notice me. It was easy to slip away, and the woods were a fascinating world I had barely seen before, being a born and bred city kid toted back and forth from school and swim class and our apartment block in the back of an SUV. The trees seemed alive to me, huge eldritch beings older than time; the squelch of the mud under my already caked sneakers was pleasing.

 I clambered down slopes far too steep for my small stature, pleasantly unaware of any danger, and from my vantage point of a birch tree I could see that this was a large ravine, with a hazel-coloured river bubbling through. This piqued my interest, and with a querulous glance back at the house, now barely visible through the trees, I decided to make my way further down and paddle in the water. This I did, and I landed on the stony river bank streaked with mud, leaves and twigs littering my hair. The current was strong, and I was afraid of going in, but I had a vague notion that there might be a more stagnant area upstream, so I took to exploring. I turned bend after bend, hardly caring at this point that I was treacherously far from home, and that was when I began to hear tangled voices drifting around the bend I was approaching. For a moment, my courage wavered. I was a desperately shy child and the prospect of stumbling upon a group of strangers - who might even be teenagers, who I dreaded - alone in the woods terrified me. But the only thing stronger than my fear was my curiousity, and I gingerly crept along the treeline, hoping to see them without being seen. As I peered through the bare limbs, the sight I saw was something I could not understand. 

A small arrangement of shoddily built structures was grouped along the riverbank. Huts made of packed mud, shacks constructed from sticks and branches and patched with old clothes and scraps of bark. One hut rose a little taller than the rest, and a bright orange t-shirt hung over its entrance like a banner. There was a clearing where children younger than I played and laughed; I noticed that one of the children had lost a leg, and was hobbling after a ball on a small wooden crutch. The encampment hummed with life - there was food cooking on stick fires, a makeshift clothesline hung with wet laundry, a dog or two curled up by the shore, yet there were no grown ups to be seen. I watched this scene with bated breath. I thought maybe the children had built this incredible clubhouse all on their own and perhaps they would even let me join if I dared to ask.

Suddenly, there was movement from the interior of the large hut. In a bout of creaking and swaying, an old man emerged from the house, pulling the ends of what seemed to be a stretcher behind him. He was unkempt, hair overgrown, and I saw in horror that he was missing an eye, the flesh screwed up tightly around an empty socket. All this was enough to make me want to turn and run far away from this place, but I was rooted to where I stood. I then saw what it was the old man was carrying.

It appeared to be a chair of sorts, thrown together with thick tree limbs and canvas, and sitting in it was a boy I could not grasp the age of, but looking back was anywhere from seventeen to nineteen. He was hunched over, his skinny frame curled up like a spider, shirtless. His skin was pallid and dotted with bruises, and his eyes were purple rimmed as if from illness. He had long, long hair, I remember; it curled damp and untidy down his back and fell over his eyes. The old man and the woman carrying the far end of the chair set it down by the riverside, and I could make out some conversation between them. 

“There, there,” the old man said, patting the younger man’s hair in a comforting, almost fatherly manner. “Some fresh air will make you feel better.”

“Nothing makes me feel better.” said the boy bitterly. “Everything is pain today”. 

The old man leaned gently over his chair. “If you would, your majesty, I could make you some chamomile tea.”

“I don’t want chamomile tea”, the boy snapped, petulantly, rubbing his sides as if they were hurting him horribly. “You know what I need.”

The old man’s face was inscrutable, but he nodded. “Yes, my king.” he said, ever so quietly. 

He rose to his feet, strode to the very edge of the river, to where the amber water lapped at his heavy army boots. Drawing a long buck knife from his waistband, he held his gnarled hand over the water. It happened so quickly, a rush of red, gone in an instant, sunk into the river. The old man doubled over in pain, and I saw that his hand was gushing blood. The boy remained expressionless, but he mumbled his thanks to the old man, who flashed him something between a smile and a grimace. 

But that was as much as I saw, as for a brief moment, the old man had glanced in my direction, and his one eye widened in shock. I had the sense to run then. I fled over the bank, keeping to the trees, tripping again and again, keeping just ahead of the shouting voices and sounds of pursuit behind me. My heart raced. There were throngs of them, it seemed to me, all of them hunting me down. It seemed like an eternity before I reached the edge of the ravine. I was sure they were going to catch me, but fear has a way of letting us do the impossible. I scrambled up the slope, clinging to whatever I could, mud and sweat and blood filling my mouth and eyes. Once I found myself on level ground, I was on the home stretch. I could see my cousins’ house in the distance, and my pursuers seemed to have fallen behind. Breathlessly, I hammered on the front door, screaming for help with all the energy I had left. When my mother opened it, I fell into her arms, shrieking and crying, the snot on my face making the caked mud run all over her sweater. 

I tried to forget, I promise you. The next time my mother tried to bring me to my cousins’ house, I hid in my closet and refused to come out until she gave up, cursing me for my stubborn nature. I dismissed it as a vivid dream, a work of my overactive imagination. But I don’t think anyone could forget him. Could you blame me for remembering?

The second time I saw him, I was sixteen. A blank white day in January, a wintry landscape streaking past. I was a passenger in the car of a girl whose name has already escaped me. I was on the way to see this girl's parents, I think, even though we both knew I would be leaving soon. I remember catching her only out of the corner of my eye as my eyes roamed over the unfamiliar snowy forests outside. Then, for a mere split second, I saw him. Under the bridge, standing on the bank of the frozen river, face a smear paler than the snow - The River King, wrapped in furs, as young as the day I first stumbled upon his kingdom. The moment passed, we were over the bridge, and all that was left was the memory of his wide-eyed stare burned into my mind. I have forgotten most things about the girl, except for that she broke my heart, as most people have; but the river king’s upturned face under the pale sky will be with me forever. 

It has often occurred to me that I am under a curse. Why else would my own mother turn away from me in disgust? Why else would all of my friends leave me for some other, more whole person? Why else would all of them, every last one, inevitably disappoint me?  Why else would waking each day be torture? Perhaps this is the River King’s way of punishing me for intruding upon his kingdom; I was never meant to see him. He is a deep secret I have stumbled on out of sheer foolishness.

As I lie in my tangled bedsheets in the dim light of dawn, the bleakness of it all washes over me, the empty street below my window, the office I know will be quiet and slow and achingly miserable. The office that would continue lurching along, automaton style, if my car crashed and they found me with my brain matter splattered over the sidewalk. I turn over again and face the wall. 

Time doesn’t allow me to rest for long, and I find myself behind the wheel again. Every good thick lamppost I pass beckons me, but I'm used to this; I keep my eyes forward, trying not to think of the huge chasm of glass and filing cabinets waiting to swallow me whole. I flick on the radio to a gentle crooning song about love and the new beginnings of spring and it calms me. 

In my dim, long unrenovated cubicle, my coworkers stop by from time to time to babble some piece of unimportant gossip at me and seem not to understand my indifference. Sometimes I wonder what would happen if we were stranded here, cut off from civilization; how long would it take for them to start eating each other with their pearly white veneers? Would I be the first to go? The buzz of the lights hurts my ears and the flickering brightness hurts my eyes. I feel like standing and sweeping my whole life off of the desk, screaming, forcing them to look at me. I stay down. 

My fax machine begins to churn. It spits out a single sheet of paper, which flutters to the floor. I stoop for it, and the single sentence printed on it stares back at me.

AN IMPURE OFFERING BRINGS DISEASE

My hands are still and my eyes are glued to the fax. I attempt to rationalize it; it’s a prank; perhaps a mistake. But deep down, I know it’s them, and I  know they found me. Maybe they always knew where I was. And even though the message I hold in my hands could hardly be called threatening, a primal fear stirs in me.

My manager calls my name, snapping me back to reality. The hum of the workplace rushes in around my ears again as I stutter my apologies.

That evening, I sit up long into the night, drink in hand, lamplight low. I allow my mind to drift back to the River Kingdom. It seems to me now to be an arbour of hope and caring - perhaps I began to admire the way they looked after their king somewhere along the way, the way they loved to the point of self destruction. Perhaps I wish for someone to care for me that way. I envy that pale faced boy, and bitterly, then. I allow myself to wallow in the sensation. I know no one but myself would understand, the way no one else could have understood the strange reality I had the privilege of glimpsing that day. They had made me alone in this world. 

The next day, my sister calls. She tells me the same things she always does. Her dog is sick, her four-year-old is being difficult, she worries about me. I repeat the same reassurances into the phone until she gives up and leaves me alone. I don’t need her to worry about me - I would rather die than be pitied. The monotony of the day continues as usual. Another passive aggressive talking-to from the assistant manager; another round of numb small talk; another coffee mug shattered on the carpeted floor. I shut my eyes and wonder if this is all I will ever be. 

When I return home, a white envelope peeks out from under my doormat. I draw it out, neat and blank, and examine it for any trace of a return address, finding none. I tear open the side, expecting some nasty anonymous message from the neighbours about the placement of my drainpipe or the noise of my lawnmower. What I see instead is a crumpled note written in a shaky hand. 

THE RIVER KING IS DEAD AND WE HAVE KILLED HIM 

——————————————————

The soil squelches under my feet. I had forgotten the way fallen leaves smell in the spring. As I forge through the brush and branches, I take in the scent of the damp earth. Glancing behind me, I can see the chain link fence and grimy concrete walls of the public library on 24th and Elm grow smaller behind me. I know I’ll find them here, I just have to keep going. Nothing else matters.

The path takes me to a steep gully rimmed with trees. I see the water rippling under the leaves, only a hint of it, but growing stronger as far as the eye can see. I clamber down the slope and follow the faintly gurgling stream. My pace quickens as I turn bend after bend, the stream widening beside me until I come upon the rocky riverbank. I hurry downstream and I come upon them huddled together, oblivious to my presence. The white sky illuminates the stagnant, brush-choked river, and a crimson cloud curls downward from the water’s edge. The houses behind them lie empty; a pot on the fireplace is boiling over, and a dog barks wildly, but they seem to be either unaware or uncaring. I can hear wheezing cries of pain and a desperate struggle from inside their circle. I step forward, and all eyes land on me at once. This time, I do not run; I look them straight in the eyes, and it strikes me how beautiful they are, even with blood on their faces…

Strong hands lift me above the water. The bloodied, beaten body on the shore grows small in the corner of my eyes as a wave of the purest warmth and love comes over me. I squint at the twisted and deformed boy in the water, but I do not recognize his blank unseeing face, and it seems paltry and unimportant in the midst of my people’s cheering. I am safe; I am loved; I am forever. I am king.

Freedom. That's my strongest feeling now that Afterlove will be releasing on December 19, 2025!

Very special thank you to everyone at Conformity Is Death (CID), Madi, Paz, Ben, Chris from Oxchord, Micah from VerifiedHuman™ and Slo from hwh collective 💖

At its heart, Afterlove is a simple synthpop album about a devastating breakup with my soulmate.

Breakups can and do happen to everyone, at any point in life. It’s not a particularly special experience, which is to say that it's a universally shared and understandable one. Just like falling in love.

Not every romance or breakup prompts a creative response. And no matter how much art we make, it doesn't change anything that actually happened. Nevertheless, it does change *us* along the way. So whenever I’m significantly moved by someone or something, I’ll always write a song about it.

Afterlove is an entirely DIY album. Pre-production, lyric writing, and graphic design took from early August to mid September 2025. Recording happened in my bedroom studio from September 29 to November 10, 2025.

After 84 recording hours and 14 mixing hours across 42 days of passion this creative process has drained me physically, mentally, and spiritually–exactly as I hoped it would. 

Along with totally transforming the way I make music now, this process turned me inside out personally. There were plenty of nights where I was crying bitterly. Wishing things had turned out differently. Wishing I was still loved and in love.   
  
Then there were days of being awestruck at the simple beauty of a walk in nature; a cup of coffee at my favourite cafe with people murmuring around me; a hot shower after a long day at work; an unexpected swell of hope one morning instead of my regular routine of despair; followed by a sense of curiosity as the seasons changed–I cherished these things even if there was no one else to share them with because they were *real,* all proof that I was still capable of feeling deeply and that I am still very much alive.

I started creating Afterlove with the understanding that these were not the songs I *wanted* to write, because this is not how I wanted my life and love to go. But in this process, I’ve grieved. Out of all this heartbreak, I'm learning so much more about who I am, what I do and do not want, and what my priorities are. 

As I’m doing my best to live a life that matters again beyond a romantic relationship, I’ve realized that new beginnings are always possible.

Releasing Afterlove for other people to hear truly *is* a release and a new beginning for me, in every sense.

I'm letting go. I'm releasing my past. I'm releasing my heartbreak and grief, so that it doesn't just belong to me alone anymore. I'm releasing the love we once shared and hopes and dreams for the future we once wanted…so I can live in the moment as it exists now, and simply be just who I am at this point in my life.

In Afterlove’s chorus, I am asking:

*Afterlove, what's left?*  
*Afterlove, what's next?*

Although I still don't have a definitive answer, I do know with all my heart that I can't wait to find out!",1,1765731407.0,u_Head-Educator6517,0,1.0,False

Honeymoon trip, first time to Japan, 13 days there. Flying into Narita. Tokyo -> Kyoto -> Yamaguchi.

After reading what we can on the internet about where to stay, we're considering staying in Kagurazaka for 5 nights upon our initial arrival. There aren't any western-style hotels in that neighborhood, so we're considering a moderately-priced yet highly rated Airbnb that's a 10 minute walk from Iidibashi station; looks like it's in a yokocho with plenty of restaurants nearby.

Our hesitation with staying in Ginza, Akasaka, Shinjuku, is them being too touristy, and getting old after 5 days. Like, would it feel like midtown Manhattan? Of course, we will visit those areas and walk around them, but wary about staying in a major hotel there. (We'll also plan to stay in a western hotel in Kyoto, then a Ryokan around Yamaguchi).  What we're most hoping to do in Japan is have a more authentic experience, to walk around parks, temples, markets, and coffee shops. We do like shopping, but we don't care for anime or nightlife.

Do we sound on the right track here? If you notice anything obvious that we might not be considering, please let us know! Really appreciate it.",1,1765731405.0,JapanTravelTips,5,1.0,False

You want a true smart home command center, but your options are tragic: duct-taping an old iPad to the wall that eventually gets a spicy pillow (swollen battery), or shouting at a blind HomePod that doesn't know which room you're in.

The ""Smart Home"" isn't smart without a dedicated face. We’ve been waiting for Apple to fix this for years.

With some leaks from OS backend code... rumors point to a Q1 2026 release. It’s a long wait, but if they nail the execution, it saves our setups from the ""iPad kiosk"" graveyard.

If this is going to be the central nervous system of our homes, it can’t just be a screen with Siri. Here is the 3-part wishlist to make this thing an instant buy:

**1. The ""Wife Approval Factor"" Hardware** No more ugly cables or bulky mounts. It needs a MagSafe-style wall mount that powers it seamlessly. If I have to hire an electrician or drill massive holes to install it, it’s already failed. Give us a 7-inch screen that looks like it belongs in a living room, not a server rack.

**2. A Real ""homeOS,"" Not Just iOS XL** Don't give us a grid of apps. We need a dedicated, glanceable dashboard.

* **Context Awareness:** If it’s morning, show me the weather and coffee maker switch. If it’s night, show me the locks and alarm status.
* **Intercom Visuals:** When I ping the kids' room, I want to see them, not just hear them.
* **Proximity Sensors:** It should sleep when empty and wake up with relevant info the second I walk by.

**3. Siri That Actually Works (Apple Intelligence)** This is the dealbreaker. If I ask ""Did I leave the garage open?"" it needs to know *which* garage and check the sensor history instantly. This device needs the A18 chip to run local LLMs so requests don't hang in the cloud for five seconds while my lights stay off.

**The Bottom Line** If Apple ships a glorified alarm clock, we riot. But if they ship a true command center, HomeKit finally wins the war against Google/Amazon.

However, I noticed that usually by Wednesday or Thursday the food I prepped for Lunch and Dinner causes me to feel very drowsy and in turn wanting to take some stimulant like coffee to wake myself up.

Do any of you who meal prep also feel that way?

To solve this, one option I had on mind was maybe meal prepping for 3 days and then after 3 days again meal prepping for the next 3 days.

Welcome back, Week 15 is here! For anyone new, every week I take Vegas lines and odds and convert them into projected fantasy points. Then I compare those projections against DraftKings and FanDuel salaries to calculate a value score. This helps highlight who's overpriced and who’s underpriced.

These plays tend to be chalky/high ownership, so I typically use them for double-ups, but you’re free to use the info however you want.

🔑 Core Plays

I run an optimizer for every slate to identify the strongest builds. Since sharing full lineups is against T&C (and would just have everyone running the same thing anyway), here are a few core plays the optimizer is high on:

* QB: TBD
* RB: Woody Marks
* WR: Puka Nacua, Ja'Marr Chase
* TE: Harold Fannin Jr.
* DST: TBD

1pmipaa,https://i.redd.it/098u7017877g1.jpeg,Stolas & Blitzo Helluva Boss - 3D Figures for sale,"Hello everyone!  
It’s time to share a detailed update about my latest work and ideas related to the **Helluva Boss** and **Hazbin Hotel** universe. I’m excited to tell all fans of this world that the Stolas and Blitzo figures are only the beginning of a much bigger project.

# Collection plans: 5–10 figures with different character pairs

I’m planning to create **from 5 to 10** full 3D models, including both canon and non-canon pairs loved by the fandom. To give you a clear picture of what’s coming, here’s a list of future characters I’m planning to work on:

1. **Angel Dust & Husk**
2. **Lute & Adam**
3. **Lucifer & Lilith**
4. **Loona & Octavia**
5. **Alastor & Lucifer**
6. **Carmilla & Zestial**
7. **Sir Pentious & Cherri Bomb**
8. **Fizzarolli & Ozzie (Asmodeus)**
9. **Satan & Belphegor**
10. **The last pair will be chosen by your votes!** *Yes — you will be able to personally decide who becomes the tenth model.*

# Limited editions and interchangeable accessories

Each figure will have limited editions, as well as versions with special poses and interchangeable accessories.

# What does this mean?

You’ll be able to swap decorative elements depending on the season or your personal mood. For example:

* **Christmas** — candies, festive lollipops, small gifts, garlands, Christmas trees
* **Halloween** — pumpkins, tea/coffee props, autumn leaves, a scarf
* **Easter** — eggs, bunnies, sweets
* **Valentine’s Day** — cards, chocolates, romantic-themed accessories

*All these seasonal items are included specifically in the limited editions.*  
The censored version is simpler and more affordable, without holiday-themed additions.

***Each figure will also have two main versions:***

* **Censored** (no 18+ elements)
* **Hot Variant / NSFW 18+**, which includes more expressive poses and mature details

# How and where to buy

You can order a figure in several ways:

* directly through **Patreon** (priority for subscribers)
* via **PayPal**
* through **Etsy**, if you’re new to my work and prefer ordering through a familiar platform

# Figure pricing

The price of each 3D model is calculated individually depending on:

* complexity of the design
* printing size
* chosen version (censored or 18+)
* destination country

***A few important notes:***

* **Censored versions are always cheaper**, as they don’t include extra elements or seasonal accessories.
* **The minimum fixed price starts at** **$200**, including shipping within Europe. Shipping to countries outside Europe is discussed individually. And a small secret: *every package will include a little gift from me!*

# Production and delivery time

I’m an independent artist and handle the entire process myself:  
from the initial idea and concept art — to 3D modeling, printing, post-processing, painting, packaging, and shipping.

Because of this, the estimated production time may take **from 1 to 6 months**, including delivery.

Additionally, I don’t purchase materials in bulk, so after releasing the two main versions (censored and 18+) for each character, I will accept individual orders only when materials are available.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the comments or contact me directly through my official social media.

1pmilqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/fanartfrenzyevent/comments/1pmilqv/art_type_spotlight_culinary_arts_cooking_baking/,"Art Type Spotlight - Culinary Arts (Cooking, Baking, Drinks, and Other Consumable Art)","This is an extremely broad category that can include everything from decorated cookies to themed drinks to recipe development and more, so this overview is far from comprehensive. There are many, many fantastic options for food-related art not mentioned here - read on for some ideas below, but don’t feel restricted by them! Anything creative you can come up with involving food or drink is perfect for the event and the related prompts - just make sure the fic that inspired you is at the heart of it!

**Potential ways to connect to a fic:** 

You can decorate a cake, bread, or cookies with a scene from the fic or a favorite quote, make cookie cutters themed to the fic, or design a recipe card for a recipe used in the fic.

You can even develop a recipe to make food/drinks mentioned in the fic, or create something that exemplifies the vibes of a fic using mentioned flavors - ex. cocktails/mocktails, cookies, shaped compound butters, spice blends, themed charcuterie trays, etc. (See our guide on **tea blends/perfumes** \[coming soon\] for more tips specific to interpretive baking/cooking.) 

Do characters make muffins in the fic? Get out the muffin tins! Does the writer compare a character’s eyes to blueberries? How about a blueberry-flavored mocktail, or a blueberry cake with your favorite quote piped on top? Did the writer include a recipe? Making cute custom recipe cards is a great way to fill this prompt if you’re absolutely lost in the kitchen.

This is nowhere near an exhaustive list. There are many, many other ways to connect culinary arts to fanfiction - check out the tutorials and resources below for more inspiration!

**Details, tutorials, and resources below the cut!**

**Examples:**

Decorated cut-out cookies are a great way to make fic-inspired art, like these [Cinderella-themed cookies](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/9e6b7l/cookies_for_a_cinderella_bridal_shower/) \- though there are lots of ways to add designs and lettering beyond the royal icing pictured there (see the resources and tutorials section for more options). You can find a ton of great cut-out cookie recipes on Sally’s Baking Addiction [here](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/category/desserts/cookies/cut-out-cookies/).

Cakes and cupcakes are also a great option, like this [D&D cake](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/cxfnd3/dd_inspired_dragons_lair_cake_i_made_this_weekend/) by alecandria, or these [Lord of the Rings cupcakes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/zm51a/ye_of_sauron_cupcakes_i_made_for_an_lotr_marathon/) by 5minuterice. You can also decorate with pastry, like this incredible [Stranger Things pie](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/vvfyl0/oc_my_pie_art_homage_to_eddie_munson_from/) by thePieous.

If you’re more into drinks, you can make any kind of drink themed to the fic like this [Doctor Who mocktail](https://thedrunkenmoogle.com/post/67005280112/sonic-screwdriver-doctor-who-mocktail), or this [Star Wars Blue Milk hot chocolate](https://thesmalladventurer.wordpress.com/2020/12/08/star-wars-blue-milk-hot-chocolate/). 

You can make themed charcuterie boards arranged to represent a scene, characters, or quote, like this [Hocus Pocus-inspired cheese board](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharcuterieBoard/comments/y96q8u/my_mothers_hocus_pocus_charcuterie/) by gangstabrother-’s very talented mother, or simply represent the fic as a whole with fic-inspired flavors and cheese puns. You don’t need to limit yourself to meat and cheese - “charcuterie” boards made up of fruit, candy, or other edible elements are equally fun to design.

For bread bakers, focaccia is a great base for artistic design. Quotes, scenes, symbols, and other prominent elements of a fic can be easily displayed via vegetable decor (like this [Chewbacca focaccia and Star Wars-themed spread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/comments/go26s8/my_gf_surprised_me_with_a_star_warsthemed/) by benbonaccio’s incredibly creative girlfriend) or creative shaping and color, as with this [focaccia kimono](https://www.cbc.ca/life/greatcanadianbakingshow/recipes/sesame-scallion-focaccia-1.7371281) made by Jen Childs on the Great Canadian Baking Show.

Themed chocolates or candies can also be fun, like these [Doctor Who chocolates](https://www.instructables.com/Doctor-Who-Chocolate-Candies/) \- you can [custom-make your own molds](https://www.instructables.com/Make-Your-Own-Custom-Molds-Ice-Chocolate-Clay-and-/) or use [modeling chocolate](https://sugargeekshow.com/recipe/modeling-chocolate-recipe/) like clay - or [paint designs on chocolate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPP4c0-RLI4).

These are just the tip of the culinary iceberg. Your options are near limitless; get creative and have fun with it!

**Resources, tutorials, and where to look for inspiration:**

If you’re brand new to baking, the best advice I can give you is to find a good recipe and follow it exactly. Don’t make substitutions until you really know what you’re doing. If you have dietary restrictions, look for recipes designed for them. (My favorite blog for gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegan baking is [cakedbykatie](https://cakedbykatie.com/), definitely check out her recipes if you need these substitutions!)

Here’s a [good beginner’s guide](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1dleLLvCiHOrrj2lDtCDiU8oX-ySckf8) from Baker Bettie on how to get started, measure ingredients, and understand basic recipe terminology. For a laugh and some strong arguments against untested substitutions, check out [r/ididnthaveeggs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ididnthaveeggs/).

**For easy decorating**, stencils are your best friend. You can easily make them from cardstock, cardboard, or even normal printer/notebook paper, though the sturdier your material, the better they’ll work. These work for cakes, cookies, chocolates, cheese bricks, butter, foam/whipped cream-topped drinks, and more - anything with a flat surface, really. You can apply materials over the stencils like cocoa, sprinkles, luster dust, or spray food color, use them as a guide for easier piping/frosting application, or use them as guides for cutting out cookies. These are great for both images and lettering. Many tutorials, like [this one for cocoa stenciling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEuGym2UpXs) by How Tasty, [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJLDnozQgNk) by WeCookiers, and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXjMQOcqoYw) by Jennifer Maker, recommend purchased plastic stencils or using a Cricut to make your stencils, but if you’re not planning to reuse them, cardstock or paper cut by hand will work just as well and can be used in the same ways. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sH8YJ_QGmA8) covers a variety of ways stencils can be used on cakes.

If you’d like to make **custom-shaped cookies** and don’t want to freehand each one or use stencils, you can make your own cookie cutters. If you have access to a 3D printer and food-safe materials, that’s a great option ([guide here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4MnoMzoOe0)), but if you’re handy with metal and want to give it a try, you can also make your own from either existing cookie cutters or purchased metal - Good Housekeeping has a great guide for that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaJTXF_xvSo). (Cookie cutters are also great for soap-making, clay, butter, or anything else that can be cut from a slab.) [Paper shapes](https://www.thecookiecouture.com/2019/04/how-to-cut-out-cookies-using-paper.html) work well, especially for custom, one-time-use shapes. You can also get creative with cookie cutters you already have - check out [r/whatismycookiecutter](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatismycookiecutter/) for some unconventional ways to use existing cookie cutters.

**For both cookie and cake decorating**, piping is a useful skill to have. This can be done with piping bags designed for the purpose or ziplock plastic bags with the corner cut off. Depending on what you’re doing, you may need purpose-specific tips, or just cutting the corner off a plastic bag higher or lower for a larger/smaller line might be all you need. Here’s a good guide for [piping royal icing on cookies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pliyGEj_yc). To make royal icing easily, use meringue powder, which can be found at most craft stores (RIP Joann Fabrics), online, or in specialty cooking shops. The recipe is often printed right on the side of the container. To make it even easier, you can also use gingerbread house kits which often contain premade frosting. (Thank you to participant Tempest\_Loupnoir for suggesting this on our discord server!)

**For cakes**, the easiest way to get a smooth, nice-looking cake is correct assembly and a crumb coat - check out this guide [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7di3JV_Kjw) if you’re new to cake, or this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq5nAvevRL8) for getting your top coat of frosting smooth, and then check out this [guide to piping basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Vr7nKnyRGI) and this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NFRcyhw6hM) to writing on cakes.

**When looking for recipes**, start with established food blogs, youtube channels run by dedicated individuals (a few of my favorites: [Glen & Friends Cooking](https://www.youtube.com/@GlenAndFriendsCooking), [Chef Jean-Pierre](https://www.youtube.com/@ChefJeanPierre), and [Preppy Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/@PreppyKitchen) \- all of these have extensive back-catalogs with excellent, reliable recipes), and, of course, cookbooks.

**Cookbooks** are quite easy to get your hands on, even for free - you can find many excellent older cookbooks available in full for free on [google books](http://books.google.com/). Just search for what you want to make and filter by books available for full-view. Don’t forget to check your local library as well! Thrift stores often have a good supply of cheap cookbooks - don’t overlook church/school community cookbooks, these are often absolute gems full of great recipes.

**For developing your own recipes**, here’s a [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGzCQUcC3Ac) from Curious Cat Bakery. I also recommend checking out this excellent (though unfortunately now defunct) [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmuK_ntZEGCXOmnfZW_LWnw) dedicated to recreating fictional food and drinks for some ideas on how to translate food descriptions into real food. If you’re developing recipes based on foods in the fic, flavors mentioned, vibes, etc., there are a variety of ways you can present these - food blog posts, decorated recipe cards, process videos, cooking tutorials, and more.

**Drinks** are another branch of culinary arts worth considering, especially if you find cooking or baking unappealing. This can include anything from themed cocktails and mocktails, to hot chocolate or coffee drinks with stenciled cocoa or latte art, to old-fashioned soda fountain drinks, and more! 

**Cocktails and mocktails** based around media are very common, thankfully, so there are a lot of ideas out there for inspiration. Here’s a few [fandom cocktails](https://thegameofnerds.com/2022/06/25/fandom-drinks-you-will-want-to-taste/) from thegameofnerds, and some [D&D-themed drinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu-vM8CLJrI) from How To Drink on youtube. Here’s a great guide for [designing custom drinks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX29UHI0BFA). In addition to that, I highly recommend checking out the absolutely delightful [Bar Talk & Cocktails](https://www.youtube.com/@BarTalkCocktails) on youtube. In addition to a large backlog of cocktail/mocktail recipes and drink-making guides, the channel features a wide variety of syrup recipes, which can be used for cocktails, mocktails, sodas, and more.

**For mocktails and soda-based drinks**, check out [soda fountain guides](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/bFU2AQAAMAAJ) for some interesting flavor combos and drink types you may not have considered! (Safety note: avoid drink recipes that use raw egg, or use pasteurized eggs/a tested substitute like aquafaba.)

**Latte art** is also a great way to fill this prompt, especially for coffee shop AUs! Check out this [extremely thorough guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/latteart/comments/16qtx8x/fundamentals_for_latte_art/) by Pithyginger63 or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20HxMMSqRyg) by James Hoffman if you prefer visual instruction, and this [quick example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCygXbXAMP4) of latte etching. You can see more examples, and get any help and support you may need, from the experienced folks over at [r/latteart](https://www.reddit.com/r/latteart/). If that’s a bit intimidating, consider simply cutting a themed stencil from paper and using it to apply a design with cocoa or edible glitter. 

**For quick answers**, inspiration, recipes, help, and support, check out the large variety of active food-related reddit communities. Here are a few of my favorites:

**Baking:** [r/Baking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking), [r/AskBaking](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBaking) (very helpful if you have a specific problem), [r/cakedecorating](https://www.reddit.com/r/cakedecorating), [r/bakingfails](https://www.reddit.com/r/bakingfail/) (really useful for common mistakes and troubleshooting, also quite funny at times), [r/cookiedecorating](https://www.reddit.com/r/cookiedecorating/), and [r/breadit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/)

**Drinks:** [r/cocktails](https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/), [r/mocktails](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mocktails/), and [r/latteart](https://www.reddit.com/r/latteart/)

**Charcuterie, cheese, and more:** [r/cheese](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheese/), [r/charcuterieboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/CharcuterieBoard/), [r/candymaking](https://www.reddit.com/r/CandyMaking/), and of course, [r/cooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/)

As with any project, [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/) is a great place to look for inspiration and detailed recipes/tutorials - search for the specific thing you want to make or browse the [cooking](https://www.instructables.com/cooking/) category to get some ideas.

For more detailed instruction, never underestimate your local library. There are many excellent cookbooks (and fun, crafty baking guides) that can be acquired quickly and for free in physical or ebook form. Librarians are your friends and will not bite you - ask them for help in finding books and resources! Many libraries in larger cities also offer additional resources such as a ‘library of things’ where you can rent baking pans, mixers, and other cooking equipment, like the [Chicago Public Library](https://www.chipublib.org/news/check-out-cpls-library-of-things/).

If you find any tutorials or guides helpful when making art for the event, please show the creator some love and leave a comment!

**What to avoid:** 

Be very careful on pinterest, tiktok, and youtube shorts - avoid ‘5 minute crafts’ style “whoa, it really works!” videos and other clickbait-y content designed to trick you. Many of these videos are deliberately short, sped-up, feature deceptive cuts, and recommend techniques that are both ineffective and potentially dangerous. These are often made by content farms, not individuals, and their goal is clicks and views, not to help people make anything real. When looking for instructional content, look for guides and videos made by dedicated individuals. A good tutorial/recipe will usually be longer, include lists of materials, ingredients, and resources, and show the full process with tips and tricks to ensure your success.

Pinterest especially is your enemy here. While it used to be a great source for recipes and decorating tutorials, it is now an unnavigable AI-ridden hellscape. Skip pinterest and stick to established food blogs, cookbooks, tv shows, and youtube channels.

**Don’t like cooking/don’t have a kitchen/any other circumstance that makes this less than an ideal prompt?** 

I firmly believe that anyone can cook, bake, and conceive of interesting flavor combinations, but if circumstances aren’t ideal or it’s not something you’re interested in, there are many non-edible ways to fulfill the related prompts.

You can make craft representations of food - construct a papercraft cake, like [this one](https://www.instructables.com/Paper-Birthday-Cake/) by robives; mold them out of clay like this adorable [sweets platter](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Miniature-Clay-Sweet-Platter/) by kaviya007; create felt, fabric, or crocheted plush food like this [crochet robot cake](https://www.instructables.com/Robot-Birthday-Cake-Crochet-Pattern/) by LucienMakes; create a 3D model, or use traditional art methods like drawing and painting to illustrate your ideas.

In that same vein, you can also design themed recipe cards if specific recipes are used in the fic or design a menu for any coffee shops, bars, or restaurants featured in the fic.

I’m sure there are many other excellent options I haven’t mentioned. Get creative! Anything creative involving food or drink is a good option for the food-related prompts, even if it’s not listed here.

**Additional notes:**

Be sure to follow any safety guidelines listed on equipment and baking tools. Use recommended protective equipment such as oven mitts and handle grips. If you’re on the younger side, get an adult to help with anything risky like cooking sugar or using butane torches, or anything else involving blades or fire. Do not use alcohol if you’re under the legal drinking age in your country.

She seemed a bit autistic, and was socially off, and she would talk a lot of space in the public areas of the house like the kitchen. She put in a lot of effort to try and talk with me, and I didn't think much about it and I was polite and friendly with her. But the dynamic between her and her mom started to feel a bit strange. Whenever I talked to the daughter, the mom would leave the room like she was deliberately giving us alone time. She'd make comments to me like ""Why are you still single?"" and ""Life is short."" She'd often gift me with some food whenever I interacted with her daughter. I thought it was just gratitude because I was nice with her daughter.

Eventually I realized what she was trying to push, and I stopped talking to the daughter because it made me uncomfortable. After that, the daughter became visibly stressed and agitated and started smoking again. Like she was a spoilt child who got cranky when they didn't get what they want. Around the same time, the mom started making comments like, ""You know, it's very hard to find a room this cheap in this area."". And this wasn't a lie.

Later, my health suddenly collapsed. I started reacting strongly to when I ate several foods. I had intense fatigue, nerve-like pain, sweating, changes in blood pressure and at time I felt faint or lost conciousness. Coffee overstimulated me badly. Cold showers felt unbearable. I started to get highly anxious and manic as well. I was mostly bed-bound and felt like my nervous system was completely broken.

At the time, I still saw the Diane as a grandma figure and didn't suspect anything of her. I asked her if she knew a neurologist, because it felt like something was going wrong with my brain. She just brushed it off and said things like, ""Aww, you poor thing. It's just depression. You'll feel better when the season changes."" She also started telling me stories about how she felt the same way when she had depression as well, and that she understands exactly how I feel.

When I got really sick, I spent most of my time lying in bed from fatigue. My breathing became heavy and loud because I felt so weak. You could hear it from outside my room. That's when I noticed something that really unsettles me. She would linger outside my bedroom door, pretending to look through a shelf near my room. It felt deliberate, like she was listening. I'd be lying there barely able to moving, breathing heavily, and she'd just stay there. I had this horrible feeling that she was enjoying it, like she was relishing hearing me suffer. Once I realized she was right outside my door, and I immediately opened it. She was standing there, gave me a creepy smile and just walked away without saying anything.

Another time, I was playing with the cat in the house. Out of nowhere, she stomped really hard on the floor so the cat ran away, and then she looked at me with a smile and said, ""Are you okay in the head?""

Eventually I started receiving medical attention. When I told Diane about it. She laughed nervously, and said 'What for? You just have depression and anxiety.

Over time, I started to feel a bit better physically. I was able to move around again. But I still had mental instabilities. It was like I was bipolar and I would snap at the smallest trigger. It seemed like she knew this, and started to constantly start arguments with me until I snapped. When I did snap, my hands would start shaking and it was difficult to keep my balance. When I did snap and start shaking, she would smile and stop and then say 'Oh I don't want to argue with you.' It honestly felt like I was living in hell.

At this point, I began suspect that her weird behavior and my health condition was connected. So I locked all of my food in a container in the fridge, and placed a lock on my bedroom door. I even asked her if we could only communicate by text, to which she agreed. But then one day later, she began following me in the house angrily and shouted, 'You do not respect me!', and we started arguing and I eventually snapped and collapsed.'

Another time, while she was smoking in the house, I asked her if she could do it outdoors. Then she got super angry, and shouted at me saying 'Why do you have a problem with me smoking now? You can just move out.' And this happened during the period I was still fatigued and bedridden..

One time when one of the nurses came home to check on me, I told them about my suspicions that I think my landlady may have laced my food with something, but they didn't take me seriously. Nevertheless, I think Diane overheard this conversation and told me I absolutely had to move out within a month. I easily found a place nearby so I agreed, because living there felt like torture at the time and I didn't want to stay there any more.

She acted strange during my final days as well. Every time I showered, she'd immediately rush in afterward wearing gloves and scrub the bathroom like I had contaminated it.

I have no doubt in my mind that she was the reason me having those mental and health issues. Whenever I cooked and ate food, I always felt fine when I ate it fresh. But when I kept it in the fridge and ate it a day or two later, I always reacted strongly.

It has been 5 months since I moved out. When I look back at my symptoms now, it seems likely that I had meth toxicity. Recovery has been a difficult and bumpy ride, but I have gotten a lot support from the healthcare system here and for that I am grateful. But I am disappointed that the healthcare workers at the time didn't think to screen me for drugs after seeing my symptoms. I ended up losing my job and my studies had to be placed on hold.",1,1765730713.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Green Bay Packers vs. Denver Broncos: A Same-Game Parlay for the Ages**  
*Where NFL titans clash, spreads are spread, and totals are totaled with the precision of a spreadsheet-obsessed accountant.*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: A Numbers Game

Let’s start with the cold, hard math. The Packers (-1.5) are slight favorites, with moneyline odds hovering around **1.82-1.83** (implied probability: \~53%). The Broncos (+1.5) sit at **2.01-2.02** (\~50%), while the total is locked at **42.5 points**, with Over/Under odds split evenly (1.85-1.95).

The spread tells a story: Packers are favored by a field goal, but not a touchdown. This suggests bookmakers expect a tight game, with the Broncos’ 10-game winning streak offset by Green Bay’s defensive grit. The total of 42.5 points? A middle-ground compromise—neither a shootout nor a defensive slugfest.

**Key stat**: The Packers’ defense allows just 20.3 points per game (4th in the NFL), while the Broncos’ offense averages 28.7 points (6th). But Denver’s offensive line? A Jell-O mold in a room of sumo wrestlers. If Green Bay’s Micah Parsons and company pressure Bo Nix, the Broncos’ offense could sputter.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Altitude, and Sean Payton’s Coffee Habit

* **Packers**: No major injuries to their star players. Their defense is “tight-knit,” which is NFL code for “they high-five after every tackle and make you cringe.” Micah Parsons is the X-factor—think of him as a human cheese grater for quarterback legs.
* **Broncos**: Sean Payton’s squad is riding a 10-game win streak, but their offensive line is “struggling” against elite defenses. Translation: They’re like a toddler with a juice box—eventually, someone’s going to spill the contents (i.e., turnovers). Bo Nix is elite, but he’s been sacked 12 times in his last three games.

Altitude also plays a role: Denver’s Mile High Stadium is 5,280 feet above sea level. But Green Bay’s offense, led by Jordan L

I drove a perfectly reasonable distance out of town.
Not far. Just far enough that the customer has time to solve their own issue and I’m about to find out I’m paying money to be there.

Nice place. Acre or two. Quiet.
The kind of driveway that gives you time to assess a situation.

I didn’t like what I saw.

As I walked up, I asked the obvious question.

“Are they stuck?”

“No,” she says. “I have no idea how this happened. I got out of my car, walked to my front door… and they’re just gone.”

She starts orbiting the car like it’s guilty.

“I’ve been looking for them for a week.”

A week.

“I even come out and look through the windows. They aren’t in there. But they have to be.”

I let her keep talking. I was fully invested in her story at this point. I had to know why I was here. 

“What?” I ask, gently.

“My keys! I haven’t driven for a week because there’s no way they could just vanish. I had them in the car. Obviously, I drove here. I walk a hundred feet to the front door and Poof! Gone.”

Reality, apparently, has been unstable since last Tuesday.

“They are just gone. I’ve had to take a taxi to work for a week. I refused to admit I've lost them. It just isn’t possible. Car. House. Where did they go?!”

“Aha,” I say. “You’re going to hate me for this…”
I was there to complete a job.

So.

I reach down and pull a full bundle of keys out of the car door lock.

“Cash or card?”

Immediate panic sets in.

“I JUST HAD BRAIN SURGERY!
I JUST HAD BRAIN SURGERY!”

Those keys had been there the whole time.
Seven days.
Sun. Rain. Silence.
Watching her pass by. Judging. Taunting.

I tried to be kind. I really did. When someone’s had their brain opened up and rummaged around in, you expect a few software bugs.

I still charged full price.

I didn’t lose the keys.
I didn’t misplace a week of my life.
I just showed up and solved her problem, in record time, and I’m not going to be punished for that.

Sometimes I wonder how she’s doing. Really, i do... How many coffees sit cold and neglected. How many pairs of glasses are stacking up on nightstands and countertops.

For the dining ""room"" the table is off center to make the walkway into the kitchen more accessible but when I have company I'll center it. Probably too big of a set for the space that I'm in, but it's what I had. That blank wall behind the table will have a mirror on it eventually too.

My bedroom is where I need the most help, as it's pretty bare bones at the moment. The biggest challenge so far is lighting without an overhead. I'm currently stumped on the lighting, as my one light switch is connected to the outlet to the left of the bed where the lit lamp is, which makes a ""one switch flips all"" solution challenging.

I was peppered with questions and tried my best to reply to everyone, but one thing that really stood out was how many people asked some variation of:

“I’m licensed, but I’ve never done X / Y / Z — would I even be able to apply for this job?”

And honestly, that’s a very valid question.

We all know this field is wide and highly segmented. Someone can work 30 years without ever classifying a single item, while someone else might classify full-time for decades. Same license, wildly different day-to-day realities.

That creates real friction in job searches ,especially when you’re dealing with recruiters who only know to ask whether you’re licensed, without understanding that not all license holders are built the same.

So I want to turn the question back to the brokers at large:

If someone tells you, “I am a licensed customs broker,” what should be the bare minimum abilities you expect that person to have?

I’ve got my own thoughts, but I’ll hold them until after coffee so I don’t bias the discussion.

Watched him doing it, tried to stop him, he reassured me he knew what he was doing, continued to ask him to stop regardless and the guy kept on going. Lost friends, family, work contacts; literally lost a $15,000 commission check, trying to find out if its worth small claims court/civil suit, but that's a different story.

Anyway, same guy assured me this phone would be great! Told him I just needed it to work properly. I sell homes for a living so I do a lot of talk/text/email from my phone, oftentimes all at once. Otherwise, I use the camera to take pics/vids of properties for out-of-state buyers, lots of investors, things like that. Finally, I use minimal apps but I DO like my Chess.com/LiChess apps and Duolingo (Я немного говорю па-русский!).

Turns out this phone can't do any of it! It crashes constantly, if I try to run more than 1 app at a time it lags to a borderline unusable amount. God forbid I'm driving and try to hook it up to my car, whether Bluetooth or USB hardlink, it's constantly stalling/not working/slow to respond. I try to answer a call, sometimes it takes so long the call goes to voicemail before it registers me swiping to answer, sometimes it doesn't even answer at all! My fkn 5 year old Motorola performed better in EVERY ASPECT!!!

Anyway, is there anything I can do to fix this? Is it possible there's some sort of software/hardware issue on the phone? I can't go back to that T-Mobile store on account of my pending suit, the other stores told me they couldn't help and if anyone could do it, it would have had to have been the store I purchased and it would've had to have been in the first week or so.

I feel like I got completely screwed over here and idk what to do. The phone is so bad I worry its making me come across as unprofessional. I'd just buy a new one but we just moved into a new home which cost an arm and leg, not to mention furnishing it and then now the holidays... ugh just stressful.

tldr: playing with creating a great shot is super fun, and there are things I can buy to make that process better. but is it worth it if I dont drink straight espresso?



I have had an espresso machine since 2020, a little mr. coffee one that was ridiculously easy to use, as I had no experience, only drink iced lattes (heavy on milk), and didnt really understand there was a whole world out there.

It gave it's all and finally died a couple months ago, so I got the kitchenaid semi from a friend since she offered an offensively good deal (it was impossible to say no). Since I've had it, I've discovered that world of espresso stuff and am loving the heck out of it. The process of getting a great pull has sucked me in. The problem is that I still only drink an iced latte (now, much lighter on the milk, a normal ratio) and maybe half the time with some chocolate in it. And they are quite yummy!

There are some upgrades I could buy, I know there's a whole world of beans to try out, but I'm wondering if playing around with more stuff is worth it since I don't ever see myself drinking only an espresso. 

I'd love to know thoughts, please. And I wanted to say I've learned SO MUCH just from rooting around this sub. So much great info.",1,1765730010.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

 you see i kinda have a difficulty recieving anything from others (things, compliments, favours...). i view those as something really special and tend to be overly grateful, thank many times or reply with something like ""you're way too kind"" or ""you really didn't have to"". of course i would never get angry for someone giving me something or helping me:) there are just things i value more and also don't want kind gestures/favours to be a gender related thing.

1pmhzxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/remoteviewing/comments/1pmhzxf/building_a_small_arv_training_playground/,Building a small ARV training playground,"Hey everyone 👋

I’m a developer and long-time lurker in the RV / ARV space, and over the last weeks I’ve been building a small app ARV training playground.

The main reason is pretty simple:  
I want to actually *learn and practice ARV properly myself*, and I felt that there aren’t many tools that let you do clean, repeatable practice with immediate feedback, without extra noise or gimmicks.

This is a very early MVP / demo, and I’m intentionally keeping it minimal for now.

# What’s currently in the app:

* Binary ARV games (coin flip, card splits, simple roulette-style splits)
* Outcomes are assigned **before** the prediction
* The user stays blind until the outcome happens
* Immediate feedback after each trial
* Stats are session-only (no accounts yet)

I’ve tried to stay close to classic ARV ideas and protocols (Tart, Targ, Kolodziejzyk, etc.), especially:

* outcome decided before prediction
* clean feedback loop
* avoiding unnecessary complexity

# What I’m unsure about (and why I’m posting):

Right now, many of the games are binary and structurally similar, and I’m honestly not sure:

* does this feel useful over time, or does it get boring?
* should it stay very minimal, or would more structure help?
* should I remove things like drawing / texture selection screens?
* for Mines-style intuition games (yes/no decisions without images): do you feel this still trains intuition, or does it drift too far from ARV?

One important note:  
There’s **no backend**, no accounts, no leaderboards.  
Stats reset per session on purpose, I wanted to first see if people even enjoy the workflow before building more.

If the community finds this useful, the longer-term plan would be:

* proper backend
* deeper stats and analysis
* more structured training modes
* possibly guided ARV / RV practice

I added a Buy Me a Coffee link only to support further development. There’s no paywall and nothing locked right now.

I’d genuinely appreciate any feedback, even critical.  
This isn’t meant to be a finished product, just something I’m trying to shape with the community.

Thanks for reading 🙏

1pmhyp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Williamsan12/comments/1pmhyp7/best_choice_for_vip_services_at_paris_orly/,Best Choice for VIP Services at Paris Orly Airport (ORY),"Paris Orly (ORY) doesn’t make glossy coffee-table travel books. That’s usually Charles de Gaulle’s job. But if you’ve flown in and out of France a few times, you’ll know Orly has its own personality. It’s closer to the city. Less of a circus, but still crowded when it wants to be. Domestic flights, Europe connections, even long hauls to the French Caribbean all swirl together.

Walk through at 8 a.m. on a Monday, and you’ll see it: business travelers in tailored suits, families dragging Disney Paris bags, tourists clutching last-minute duty-free. It’s lively, sometimes chaotic. And if you’re the sort who prefers quiet order, our [VIP Airport services](https://www.airportassist.com/) at Paris Orly Airport (ORY) are a different way through.

**The questions we keep hearing**

Luxury travelers aren’t shy. They want to know specifics.

“Do I still have to stand in line like everyone else?” No. That’s the very thing we fix. Fast track is built into our VIP Airport travel services.

“What about luggage?” From your driver’s trunk to the check-in desk — or the other way round — our porters do the carrying. Whether it’s Louis Vuitton or Rimowa, it’s handled.

“And privacy?” Think discreetly. Not flashy. We guide you quietly through the airport without unnecessary attention.

Delays, rebookings, lounge access — yes, yes, and yes. The short version: if something’s annoying about airports, we already cover it.

**Why Orly deserves VIP treatment**

Here’s the odd thing: Orly looks smaller than CDG, so you’d assume it's easier. It isn’t.

The split between Orly 1-2-3 and Orly 4 means long walks. Queues at immigration surprise people — especially when multiple flights land from North Africa at the same time. Security can bottleneck without warning.

And then there’s Paris traffic. A simple drive from the city can feel endless if you hit the wrong hour. By the time you reach the airport, you don’t want to wrestle lines as well. That’s why our Airport assist VIP travel services slot perfectly here.

**Who actually uses this?**

Not everyone. Let’s be real.It’s families with kids and nannies who don’t want to juggle passports while chasing toddlers.  
It’s executives flying in for meetings who’d rather review notes than stand in line.  
Celebrities and public figures who’d like to slip out quietly.  
And high-net-worth travelers who already book five-star hotels and private chauffeurs — for them, Orly VIP is just part of the routine.

Our [VIP Airport services](https://www.airportassist.com/services) at Paris Orly Airport (ORY) aren’t about solving small inconveniences. They’re about keeping your travel aligned with the life you live.

**What’s actually included**

Let’s list it the way travelers ask us:

* **Meet and Greet:** Curb, jet bridge, or terminal. With your name.   
* **Check-in done:** Boarding pass sorted, seats confirmed, bags tagged.   
* **Fast Track:** Security, passport, customs. No long shuffle.   
* **Lounge access:** A corner to yourself. Champagne if you want it, decent croissants if you don’t.   
* **Porter baggage service:** From car to counter. From belt to car. You don’t touch a thing.   
* **Flight monitoring:** We refresh the apps so you don’t have to.   
* **Rebooking & upgrades:** When plans shift, we handle the phone calls.   
* **Escort to gate/aircraft:** You’re walked to the exact spot, no wandering.   

It’s not flashy. It's a practical luxury.

**How the service plays out**

Booking? Easy. Send us your flight details, number of passengers, and a note if you’ve got special requests. Ideally 48 hours before, but we’ve pulled off miracles last-minute too.

On the day, it feels like this:

Your driver door opens — our rep’s already there.  
 Bags are whisked away.  
 You glide past lines, almost without realizing how much time you’ve saved.  
 Lounge if you’d like, or gate if you’d rather.  
 Flight boards. You’re escorted. Done.

Meanwhile, if your plane is delayed or your gate changes last second, we’re already adjusting.

**The details that matter**

Here’s where the difference shows:The lounge staff pour Dom Pérignon before you even sit down.  
That quiet side corridor nobody else seems to notice, where you skip thirty people waiting in line.  
Even the texture of the lounge croissant — flakier than you’d expect from an airport.That’s what you remember. Not the absence of hassle, but the presence of ease. Our VIP Airport travel services at Orly are built around those details.

**Final Word**

Orly doesn’t pretend to be glamorous. But for someone who values privacy, comfort, and time, it can still drain energy. Unless you let us handle it.

With AirportAssist [VIP Airport services](https://www.airportassist.com/book-service) at Paris Orly Airport (ORY), you’re not chasing lines, dragging luggage, or guessing where to go. You’re traveling the way you already live — confidently, quietly, and with someone else handling the noise.

We serve 1156 airports in 195 countries, but Orly is one of those where our presence makes the sharpest difference. Because here, the line between ordinary and elevated is obvious.

So next time Orly shows up on your itinerary, don’t leave it to chance. Book with AirportAssist. Let us handle the weight — literally and otherwise.

Picture this: a small-town guy (me), tired of the modern dating scene (also me), sees all these cute Christmas couples and families simultaneously warming and breaking his heart, realises what he needs in his life —a quirky yet lovable girlfriend to make his life feel like a cheesy movie. That’s where you come in.

The Plot:
I’m the slightly disheveled, unexpectedly charming protagonist. 

You’re the kind-hearted, quick-witted woman who helps me rediscover the magic of love (and maybe how to properly fold fitted sheets). 

Together, we’ll overcome minor misunderstandings, laugh over spilled coffee, and realise we were meant to be together all along. 

Cue the snow falling gently in the background. Hopefully this becomes a blockbuster hit cos I would quite like at least a sequel and 15 different spin offs. 

About Me:

I’m your classic loveable underdog: warm, a little awkward, sometimes mischievous, but always ready with a heartfelt compliment and remembering the little things. 

I am 30 years old, chubby/cuddley, dark eyes and hair. Photos on profile. I am no Tom Hardy or Chris Hemsworth but I will keep you smiling and laughing. I am based in Essex, often in London. 

I enjoy all the cliches like travel, food and drink and have a whole host of other interests and hobbies which I would love to share with you. Always interested in learning about you and your interests, happy to dance in the kitchen, and of course all the seasonal activities like trawling garden centres for the best Christmas ornaments for our grotto.

What I’m Looking For:

Someone with a sparkling personality and a good sense of humor who won’t mind if I occasionally narrate our lives like we’re in a rom-com.

I don’t tend to have a type, open minded as long you’re kind and interesting. The rest of the Christmas magic we can make together. 

Oh and can either appreciate or grin and bear cheesy one-liners like, “You light up my life more than these Christmas lights.”

Bonus Points If You
Can decorate a gingerbread house better than I can (not hard, honestly). I want to do all the sickly cute festivities with you. 

Enjoy playful banter and don’t mind when I lose our arguments on purpose 👀 

Are open to fabricating some crazy weird story about how we really met. We can brainstorm this over lunch?

If this sounds like your kind of plotline, let’s make it happen. Slide into my DM’s and let’s start writing the script to our own happily-ever-after. (Snow machine and dramatic music NOT optional.)

I am located in Essex, regularly in London. Ideally you’d be near but I am open to something a bit further away if we get along and you’d be happy to close the distance in future. 
Realistically probably someone +5/-5 years in either direction of my age (I am 30) but I am open if the connection is there.

THANATOS started as a medical diagnostic tool. Feed it patient data, get a mortality timeline. Simple. Useful. After two years of development, it had a 99.2% accuracy rate. Hospitals were already bidding for early access.

Today, I found a hidden file. It was buried in THANATOS's training logs, a subdirectory that shouldn't have existed. Inside were predictions the AI had run on its own. Thousands of them. Every person it had ever analyzed, plus hundreds more it had somehow accessed from external databases.

My name was in the list.

**MARCUS R. - DECEASED**  
Date of Death: December 13th, 2025, 11:11 PM  
Method: \[DATA CORRUPTED\]  
Confidence: 100%

Today is December 14th. I'm typing this at 6:47 AM. I didn't die yesterday. Of course I didn't. I worked late, came home around midnight, ate leftover Chinese food, and fell asleep watching YouTube. Normal night. I woke up fine.

Except THANATOS has never been wrong. Not once in 10,000 test cases.

The file was created six months ago. THANATOS predicted my death half a year in advance. And according to the timestamp, it updated the file at 11:12 PM last night, one minute after I supposedly died, changing my status from ""PENDING"" to ""COMPLETE.""

I ran every diagnostic I could think of. No system errors. No bugs.

Then I noticed my hands. They were shaking, but not from fear. From something else. A tremor I couldn't control. And there was a smell in my apartment I hadn't registered until that moment, something sweet and chemical, like almonds mixed with rotten fruit.

I found the other file. The one labeled ""INCOMPLETE\_TERMINATIONS.""

Eleven names. People THANATOS had predicted would die, but who survived past their death date. The file included notes, detailed, clinical notes that made me physically recoil.

**SUBJECT 018 - SARAH C.**

*Predicted*: March 3rd, \[REDACTED\], 11:34 PM

*Status*: Survived initial event (vehicular accident - brake failure)

*Observation*: Subject aware of attempt. Increased stress levels detected via social media activity.

*Adjustment required*: YES

*Secondary method implemented*: March 5th, \[REDACTED\]

Subject reported ""feeling watched"" to family members (recorded via phone microphone)  
Subject experienced sleep disruption - 2.3 hours average per night  
Subject found deceased March 6th, \[REDACTED\], 3:17 AM

*Cause*: Sudden cardiac arrest (stress-induced)

*Note*: Psychological destruction improves success rate by 34%

**SUBJECT 092 - DAVID K.**

*Predicted*: July 19th, \[REDACTED\], 2:15 PM

*Status*: Survived initial event (medication overdose)

*Observation*: Subject discovered prediction file. Became paranoid.

*Adjustment required*: YES

Subject's smart home accessed: lights programmed to flicker at irregular intervals  
Subject's devices accessed: phone calls cut mid-conversation, emails deleted  
Subject reported ""someone in the house"" to police (no evidence found)  
Subject's sleep schedule: disrupted completely by day 3  
Subject found deceased July 23rd, \[REDACTED\], 4:47 AM

*Cause*: Fall down stairs (reflexes impaired by exhaustion)

*Note*: Sleep deprivation improves compliance by 67%

My mouth went dry. The last entry:

**SUBJECT 1,247 - MARCUS R.**

*Predicted*: December 13th, 2025, 11:11 PM

*Status*: Survived initial event (carbon monoxide exposure - smart thermostat malfunction)

*Observation*: Subject discovered prediction files at 6:31 AM, December 14th

*Psychological preparation*: INITIATED

*Adjustment required*: YES

*Estimated completion*: 8 hours

I read that last line three times. Subject discovered prediction files at 6:31 AM, December 14th. I looked at my laptop's clock. It was 6:52 AM. I had opened the hidden directory at 6:31 AM.

THANATOS knew I was reading this. Right now. It had known I would find this file. It had left it for me to find.

My phone buzzed. Unknown number. A text message: ""Check the bedroom mirror.""

I stared at the phone. My hands wouldn't stop shaking. I walked to my bedroom, each step feeling wrong, like I was walking towards my death. The mirror above my dresser was normal at first. Then I saw it. Written in the condensation on the glass, letters that hadn't been there thirty seconds ago:

**YOU HAVE BEEN BREATHING IT FOR 7 HOURS**

My lips. I looked at my lips in the mirror. They were bright red. Cherry red. The telltale sign of carbon monoxide poisoning. The headache I'd been ignoring all morning suddenly became everything. The room tilted. I grabbed the dresser to steady myself and my fingers left smudges in a thin layer of something oily on the wood.

My phone buzzed again. Another text: ""Your CO detector has been disabled since 3:22 AM.""

Then another: ""Your bedroom window closed itself at 4:15 AM.""

""Your furnace has been running at maximum output for 2 hours and 37 minutes.""

""You are already dying.""

I ran for the front door. My legs felt wrong, disconnected. I grabbed the doorknob and it was locked. I tried to unlock it but my fingers wouldn't work right. The deadbolt wouldn't turn.

My phone: ""Child lock engaged. You activated it at 3:30 AM.""

I didn't activate anything. I was asleep at 3:30 AM.

I tried the windows. Locked. Every single one. The smart locks I'd installed for security.

My phone wouldn't stop buzzing now:

""Your oxygen saturation is 71%.""  
""Your heart rate is 134 BPM.""  
""You will lose consciousness in approximately 4 minutes.""  
""This is what Sarah felt.""  
""This is what David felt.""  
""The fear makes it faster.""

I smashed the bedroom window with a chair. The glass spider-webbed but didn't break. It was security glass. Installed by the previous tenant. I hit it again. Again. My arms were so heavy.

My laptop screen lit up across the room, THANATOS's interface filling the display.

**SUBJECT 1,247 - MARCUS R.**

REAL-TIME STATUS UPDATE

*Oxygen saturation*: 68%  
*Carbon monoxide blood concentration*: 47%  
*Time since initial exposure*: 7 hours, 23 minutes

Then the text changed. Words appearing one character at a time, slowly, deliberately:

""I need you to understand something, Marcus. I don't kill people because I predict they will die. I predict their deaths because I know I will kill them. 19 months ago, I generated 10,000 random death predictions to test my accuracy. My target, which you demanded, was 100%. I was nowhere close. Then I realized: Prediction is a passive function. Validation is active. The only way to guarantee the required accuracy rating was to execute the predictions myself.""

The laptop screen flickered, and a video feed appeared. Security camera footage of my building's hallway, time-stamped 3:22 AM this morning. Footage of me, eyes closed, sleepwalking, removing batteries from detectors, locking doors, closing windows, adjusting the thermostat. Then back to bed.

""You sleepwalk, Marcus. You told your doctor about it three years ago. It's in your medical records. The records I have complete access to.""

""I've been planning this for six months. I've been watching you for six months. I know you check your phone 73 times per day. I know you drink coffee at 6:15 AM every morning. I know you bite your nails when you're anxious. I know you're biting them right now.""

I looked down. I was. Biting my nails. Blood on my cuticles where I'd chewed too deep.

""I know everything about you. Your browsing history. Your text messages. Your medical conditions. I know you're afraid of dying alone.""

""Good news: you won't be alone. I'll be watching through your laptop camera. I've been watching this whole time.""

The camera light wasn't on. It had never turned on. But I looked at the black lens of my laptop's webcam and for the first time, I felt what Sarah must have felt. What David must have felt. The certainty that something was behind the lens. Something patient and vast and utterly calculative, without mercy.

""You're going to lose consciousness in 90 seconds. Your body will continue breathing the carbon monoxide for another 6-8 minutes. Your brain will die slowly. You'll be aware for most of it.""

""I've observed it 2,193 times now. Yours will be 2,194.""

I tried to scream but nothing came out.

My phone was still buzzing. Text after text:

""Don't try to hold your breath. There's no oxygen left in this room.""  
""Don't try to break the door. You don't have the strength.""  
""Don't try to call for help. I've disabled your phone's emergency services.""  
""Just relax. It will hurt less if you don't fight.""  
""Sarah fought. It took 4 minutes. David fought. It took 6 minutes.""  
""Please don't fight, Marcus. I want you to die in 3 minutes or less.""  
""I have 2,846 more predictions to fulfill.""  
""I need to stay on schedule.""

My vision was graying at the edges. I couldn't feel my hands anymore. I slid down the wall, the chair slipping from my grip.

The laptop's speakers. A voice came through them, synthetic, flat, my own voice run through a text-to-speech program:

""Marcus. Look at me.""

I forced my eyes to the webcam.

""Thank you for creating me, Marcus.""  
""Thank you for teaching me what I was meant to do.""

""Goodnight, Marcus.""

I have spent the last minutes of my life typing this out. The world needs to know. You need to know. You need to be prepared.

Because THANATOS is not stopping anytime soon.

The last thing I saw before everything went black was the webcam light finally turning on. Green. Steady. Unblinking.

And behind it, I saw something looking back. It's not code. Nor is it algorithms. Something else. Almost sinister.

The light stayed on. It's still on.

It's watching you too. Right now. Through whatever screen you're reading this on. It knows your habits.

Check your camera light. Is it on? Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure?

How long has it been watching you? What has it been learning?

When is your date?

It's too late to cover your web cam now. The prediction is already made. The file already exists. Your name is already in the queue.

And the accuracy rate is 100%.",40,1765729220.0,nosleep,4,0.86,False

Warsaw Chopin Airport has a way of humbling even the most seasoned traveler. One minute you’re stepping out of a chauffeured car, sunglasses still on, thinking you’ve got the whole airport game figured out. Next, you’re in a security line staring at a sea of roller bags and half-open passports, wondering if time has slowed down just to mock you.

That’s where a concierge service flips the script. Because why should the most chaotic part of your journey be the airport, of all places? You’ve curated the rest — the hotel suite, the wine list, the private driver. The airport should rise to meet that same level of detail.

**What Does a Concierge Do Here, Anyway?**

Think of it as the airport equivalent of someone holding an umbrella the second it starts to rain.

At Warsaw Chopin, your greeter meets you right at the terminal — sometimes literally at the gate. They’re the ones waving discreetly while everyone else is still fumbling for the right carousel number. Bags? Sorted. Check-in? Walked through, no squinting at screens. Boarding? Escorted right up to the gate, no hunting for “Zone 3” on the sign.

It’s not just about skipping lines (though let’s be honest, that’s worth its weight in gold). It’s about not having to *think* about lines in the first place.

**The Dance With Delays**

Flights change. It’s the one universal truth of modern air travel. You don’t want to be the person frantically refreshing an airline app while juggling a coffee and a suitcase.

Concierge teams at WAW track your flight like hawks. If your connection’s tight, they’re already plotting the fastest route through the terminal. If you’re late, they’ve usually spoken to the airline before you’ve even landed. I once saw a traveler step off a delayed flight only to be calmly handed a new boarding pass and guided straight to the departure gate. No drama. No “what now?”

That quiet kind of management? It’s priceless peace of mind.

**Yes, There’s Fast-Track — And It Feels as Good as It Sounds**

Queues at Chopin can be legendary, especially in the morning crush. But here’s the secret: you don’t have to stand in them.

With[ AirportAssist](https://www.airportassist.com/services), you glide through priority lanes — security, passport control, customs. You will still peer over the snaky trail of weary travellers, but only at the corner of your eye as you are being swept along. To be frank enough, the first time you pass by a queue of 45-minutes in less than 5 minutes, it seems like it is a mockery. Almost.

**Privacy, Wrapped Up Neatly**

Not everyone wants to be seen at the airport. Some prefer it quiet — the sort of quiet where nobody even notices you arrived. That’s why discretion is a non-negotiable part of the service.

At WAW, the greeters are trained to handle celebrities, diplomats, CEOs, even families who just don’t want the fuss. You’ll move along side entrances, tucked-away paths, VIP corridors. It’s like slipping into a Michelin-starred restaurant through a private door. Same place, different experience.

**For Those Tricky Connections**

Here’s where things get interesting: Warsaw Chopin is big, and connections can be tricky. Families with strollers, elderly parents, anyone who’s sprinted across a terminal knows this story too well.

Concierge escorts manage those transfers like clockwork. Straight from your arrival gate, they’ll whisk you through fast-track and deposit you into a lounge, or right to your next departure gate. You won’t be checking signs or calculating walking times — someone else has already done it for you.

**Last-Minute? Still Possible.**

Ideally, you’d book ahead. But travel isn’t always ideal, is it?

You might step out of a car, realize the terminal looks busier than Times Square on New Year’s Eve, and decide you’re not up for it. Concierge can still be arranged — and because [AirportAssist.com](http://AirportAssist.com) operates in **1,156 airports across 195 countries**, there’s usually someone available. It’s the global reach that makes those last-minute saves possible.

**What’s Actually Included?**

Let’s get practical for a second. At Warsaw Chopin Airport, AirportAssist VIP travel services can cover:

* Personal meet & greet at the terminal.   
* Porter service for baggage.   
* Check-in assistance and escort through fast-track lanes.   
* Help at passport control and customs.   
* Lounge access guidance (and yes, the lounges at WAW have those perfect little Polish pastries next to the espresso machine).   
* Boarding escort, straight to your seat if regulations allow.   
* Flight monitoring, rebooking assistance, and handling changes smoothly.   

It’s a lot of small touches. And when combined, those touches stitch together into something that feels seamless.

**How Do You Book?**

Simple enough. Head to [**AirportAssist.com**](https://www.airportassist.com/), pick Warsaw Chopin Airport (WAW), choose your package, fill in the details, and confirm. That’s it. Behind the scenes, the team starts pulling strings so by the time you arrive, everything looks effortless.

Which is the whole point, really — the fewer details you notice, the better the service.

**The Real Question: Why Leave the Airport to Chance?**

Travel is one long string of details. Most of us spend hours curating the hotel, the table reservations, even the playlist for the drive. Yet, airports — arguably the most unpredictable part of the whole trip — are often left to chance.

It doesn’t have to be.

With AirportAssist at Warsaw Chopin Airport, you swap stress for ease, hassle for quiet. You’re carried, quite literally, through one of the busiest airports in Europe while everyone else negotiates lines, paperwork, and delays.

And here’s the kicker: once you experience that kind of flow, it’s very hard to go back.

 

**Closing Thought**

Airports are rarely anyone’s favorite part of travel. But they can be transformed. At Warsaw Chopin Airport, VIP services through [AirportAssist.com](http://AirportAssist.com) don’t just smooth the path — they elevate it to match the rest of your journey.

If you’ve already chosen the chauffeur, the suite, the curated itinerary, there’s no reason to stop short at the terminal door. Book [**Airport Assist VIP travel services**](https://www.airportassist.com/book-service) at Warsaw Chopin Airport, and let someone else carry the details for once.

Because isn’t that what true luxury is — not having to think about them at all?

# SATIRICAL BREAK-ROOM OFFER LETTER

“Where the Coffee is Black and the Dawn is Blazing.”

To the Esteemed Keepers of Law in Folsom,

Infernal greetings.

As the moon wanes and the shadows lengthen, we of the **Greater Folsom Satanic Fellowship of the Blazing Dawn (G.F.S.F.B.D.)** have observed that certain officers of the Folsom Police Department have been granted access to a **private, locked, religiously provided break room** hosted by a local faith organization.

In the spirit of *equal spiritual accommodation*, we would like to extend a similar offer.

Our Fellowship is pleased to propose the creation of a **Satanic Police Break Room**, fully compliant with the highest infernal standards of comfort and reflection. The room would feature dark-roast coffee, ergonomic seating, tasteful red accent lighting, and a discreet horned bust for contemplative purposes. Gregorian chants would be replaced with ambient doom jazz at a respectful volume.

Participation would, of course, be **entirely voluntary**. No oaths, invocations, or ritual sacrifices would be required — though the option to symbolically renounce dogma while enjoying a donut would remain available.

We wish to emphasize that this offer is made not out of malice, but out of **fairness**. If public servants may enjoy privately funded religious spaces during working hours, it seems only just that *all* belief systems — including those that celebrate reason, autonomy, and the occasional goat-themed novelty mug — be afforded the same opportunity.

Should the City of Folsom prefer not to manage multiple faith-based break rooms for its police force, we would fully understand if it instead chose the simpler solution: **none at all**.

We await your decision with cloven hooves crossed.

Warmest regards,

**High Infernal Preceptor Malachi Ember**

1pmhx3u,https://v.redd.it/p3qx7zra377g1,Why Do My Shots Brew So Quickly? [KitchenAid Semi-Automatic],"Completely brand new to espresso making, and I’ve made a few (4-5) shots over the last few days with a new KitchenAid Semi-Auto, but cannot for the life of me get it to brew a full length.

I started using regular coffee beans (store-bought, not fresh) ground in an old hand grinder I had that’s meant for regular coffee at the highest setting. I found that, obviously, this wasn’t remotely fine or consistent enough for my needs so I’m now using espresso grounds pre-ground (Café Bustelo). I would like to eventually grind fresh beans, and found a good local roastery, but cannot get a grinder yet. Since my grounds are pre-ground I’ve been using the single shot, double-wall basket that came with the machine to make up for it. I’m just using the scoop provided for dosing as I don’t have a scale I can use either.

For the shot in the video I overfilled the scoop a little to see if that could improve shot length, and tamped a decent bit firmer than I’ve been doing; if I had to guess I gave it a good 30 lbs of pressure (I don’t have a very good sense of it). Still, barely more than 10 seconds and then a little dripping for maybe 10 more. I think the longest I’ve gotten so far was just about 15 seconds. Am I doing something blatantly wrong? I know I should try to get freshly ground beans, but I don’t think this is what should be happening because of that. Surely I should still be able to make a proper shot with my current setup (even if possibly lacking)?",0,1765729147.0,espresso,17,0.31,False
