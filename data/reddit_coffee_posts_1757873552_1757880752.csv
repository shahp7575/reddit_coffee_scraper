1nh1fo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxGreece/comments/1nh1fo5/is_my_parish_turning_into_a_cult/,Is my parish turning into a cult?,"Hello, forgive me I know this is a super long post…

I guess I’m reaching out on here because I’m at the end of my rope. I’ve been orthodox for almost 10 years at the same parish about four years in a different priest took over our parish. I was at rock bottom when he took over in an extremely physical and emotionally abusive marriage. I was suicidal and extremely vulnerable. Once he took over I started meeting with him and I feel stupid because I haven’t ever questioned him until now because I’ve been too afraid of being disobedient. Since the beginning, I’ve always walked away from our meetings with confusion, fear and uncertainty. In the beginning, he tended to side with my abusive exhusband until my ex started verbally attacking and threatening my priest. Then finally, my priest believed me and allowed (not blessed) me to get a divorce.

I was a single mom with three young children for a couple years and then he started pressuring me to get back together with my other ex-husband (note: I have been married twice and this was my first daughter’s father —not my younger two kid’s). That marriage was also abusive physically and psychologically. We had been married super young & The man has always been neurotically obsessive and controlling about me. He was very clingy when we were together 13 year ago and I felt like I had no freedom to breathe in that relationship. He became very physically violent towards the end of it when I voiced these things to my priest, he dismissed them and proceeded to tell me that it was my fault that he was violent toward my kid and I and it was because he was scared that I was suicidal at the time (which I was severely depressed). I believed him and was just in such a raw vulnerable place because I was now on my own with three kids dirt poor and felt like I didn’t have any other choice but to get back together with this man.

This man has always been waiting for me to get back together with him even when I was remarried. I’ve always felt like he was lurking around the corner. I’ve never felt attracted to him if anything I’ve always felt repulsed by him. So anyway my spiritual father convinced this man to come into the Orthodox Church to receive holy baptism so he did and thank God I have seen the church really transform him over the past couple years. He went from being a borderline Satanist to a humble family man. He genuinely is remorseful for the way he has treated me and acknowledges his past abusive sins no excuses or blame. We ended up getting married by this priest. He actually has expressed frustration with our spiritual father because he feels like this priest is just enabling him and puffing him up. He’s frustrated because he has these passions and sins he needs to work through and the priest just sees him in rose colored glasses. I on the other hand have been told every time I ever bring my questions or struggles to this priest about forgiving my ex-husband and being able to heal our relationship from the past trauma and abuse and dismissed and told that I’m not attracted to him because I’m too vain and that I’m going to the worst place in hell because I can’t except my ex ex-husband’s love. (now this man is very loving and genuinely repentant which I see, but none of my past trauma from the abuse has ever been addressed. It’s always been denied and covered up by my priest so I’ve had no way to heal and I’m still stuck in fighter flight mode when I’m around my ex-husband. I avoid him at all cost, and I’m terrified of him even though he is a completely different person).

This priest told me a couple of weeks ago that my vanity was so bad that it would be interesting if I got in a car accident and my face got disfigured, or if I got cancer of the mouth and lost all my teeth, or lost my right hand (Im an artist). He has also told me that he wants to scream at me so loud that the flesh on my face melts off. (keep in mind that I don’t wear a lot of make up, I don’t dye my hair, I try my best to dress modestly in church wearing long dresses or skirts and covering my head. I do like to feel pretty and healthy so I try to exercise, eat healthy, and sometimes wear a little bit of mascara I also don’t argue with this priest. I’m too scared. I’ve always tried to be polite when I’ve had questions phrase them in a way that is out of a desire to understand and not by a means of trying to prove my priest wrong). He rarely offers me encouragement and all of our couples counseling meetings have been spent berating me and showering my husband with praise. He has made me leave the room during couples counseling so that way he could talk negatively about me to my husband. This priest is constantly giving my husband scriptures to read about men in the Bible married to ungodly women. My husband is getting so frustrated with this priest. And feels terrible for the way my spiritual father treats me. All along I have been in denial and been convinced that this is my fault and I just need to be more obedient and repent deeper and that I’m the one at fault. But something recently has really caused me to start wondering if this man is really the best person to be my spiritual father… every time I’m around him in church. I feel like a deer in the headlights. I feel sick to my stomach around him and absolutely terrified of him. I’m constantly afraid that I’m going to burn in hell . I’ve even questioned whether or not orthodoxy is for me because I’m too much of a wicked sinner for it. And that maybe I made a mistake by getting baptized because now I’m gonna face a greater judgment.

I hear very similar stories from other women in our parish that are frustrated with our priest, but it’s very kept quiet. Most of the parish is very subservient and is convinced that our priest is a saint. When I’ve tried to go to one of the nuns in our church (who I’ve been friends with for years) she very strongly defends our priest and indicates to me that any doubts I have about our priest is because I’m too rebellious. I’m so frustrated because I feel like I’m in a spiritual limbo where I have these passions and sins that I want to overcome, but I’m terrified to go deeper in my faith because I’m so afraid of burning in hell.

Our parish has a lot of odd behaviors to it that I’m starting to wonder if this is normal parish behavior or if these are signs of a cult (not saying that our parish is a cult just that maybe it has signs)… we view anyone that walks out of our parish and starts going to a different parish as rebellious or disobedient and pity them. Our priest tends to side with the men when it comes to spiritual counseling, I’ve heard this from other women that are confused too, but too afraid to leave. One woman came out in a mass email to all the women in our church., saying that her husband raped her and that she was really struggling on how to heal from this feeling betrayed and then came back a week later saying that our priest told her to apologize for sending the email out in the first place and saying that she didn’t mean to scandalize anyone and  she needs to not gossip about her husband because it will hurt the marriage. All of the women in our church only wear long skirts and dresses even outside of church, seeing even loose jeans or long shorts as sinful things for women to wear.

Our church  is huge and has quadrupled in size since covid has created all these little sub organizations out of it (private school, a farm, men’s and women’s groups, housing opportunities, a couple of orthodox brands with our priest’s icons, coffee roasting business, podcasts, a large (only women’s) monastic group attached to the church, etc. All these things being claimed to be used as a means for our community to be more self-sufficient and less reliant on big government)… but it can also feel very isolating because when I choose not to enroll my kids in the private school and instead homeschool, I feel very shamed by our priest. With all these bells and whistles In our church it can feel like a celebrity or branded parish (very elite) idk how else to describe it…

Anyway, I am scared to leave because all of our friends are at this parish everyone there except for our priest is so loving and kind and humble and has been there for me from the bear very beginning. All of our kids friends are there they’ve been our family all these years we even bought a house right down the street from the church. We have devoted our family‘s life to this parish so leaving feels like it’s just not an option. I feel very confused right now and uncertain of how to proceed. Maybe I’m just in the wrong because of my rebelliousness? I just I’m looking for some other orthodox perspectives outside of our little bubbly in this parish that we are in…

Just to add our parish is part of the Serbian diocese.

Forgive me tldr; this has just been building for years and I really need some outside perspectives. Also any prayers for my family to have clarity on how to move forward is greatly appreciated! 🙏💜",2,1757880489.0,OrthodoxGreece,0,1.0,False

1nh1d43,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Fiction_Bureau/comments/1nh1d43/prelude_to_madness/,Prelude to Madness,"When the two books moved, I was at first unconcerned. In fact, I’d say dismissive. One of us misread a title and shelved the book on the wrong shelf. It happens. But this pairing? A Thomas Harris novel, a DVD, and an anthology of Bloom County? That’s simple negligence. Infuriating, I’d say.

Impatiently, I grabbed the Bloom County anthology and threw it on the coffee table. It made a loud “plop,” which was further proof that I was irritated, as evidenced by my grimace and unintelligible utterance.

I busied myself with the correct arrangement of the shelf.

I found several other books that were not assigned to the correct shelf, but I managed to reassign them with nothing more than an eye roll.

  Once my task was complete, I turned sharply on my heel as if I was repudiating the very existence of mis-archived books. My dog lifted his head, ears cocked, grumbled about something, and lay his head back down. Eyes closed, he resumed rest time. Clearly, he was less emotionally vested in the bookshelf. I walked over to reassure him and perhaps have him impart some wisdom to me, but I stopped. The Bloom County anthology lay quietly on the coffee table, but a small piece of paper peeked out from the top as if to wave at me.

 **IT BEGINS**

“Well, hello,” I said to no one but the now snoring dog and maybe one disinterested plant.

I grabbed the paper and tossed it on the couch for later disposal. Bloom County returned to its assigned shelf with a stern warning issued should it decide to move around during the night. “Keep testing me and you’ll end up downstairs next to ‘Where the Wild Things Are.”

The simple beauty of having a house full of books is the ability to create themed shelves with no apparent organization except that of my mind. On a whim, I could reorganize by time period, or on a particularly cold day, by color of the dust jacket. Sigh. I wouldn't dare, but the thought appeals to some dark OCD nature within.

I rested that evening until I thought of making a cup of tea before bedtime. My journey took me past a now organized and aesthetically pleasing bookshelf. The coffee table was clear of clutter, the floors sparkling, less one perpetually sleepy dog with a sometimes attitude. The piano sat next to the dog, likely with some regret, and the couch aligned nearly perfectly with it. I must have bumped it as I wrangled the Bloom County book, a worthy, but now vanquished foe.

I took a moment to push the couch back into perfect alignment and saw something curious. The paper I had taken from Bloom County (you’re not forgiven yet!) was lying there casually on the couch cushion. I was certain that I had wadded it up in frustration and with a fastball down the middle, wedged it in one of the cushions. Except that this paper was unfolded and almost neatly placed in the middle of the cushion. This was not my handiwork. I was alone in the house (was I?) and only the dog knew of my ill feelings towards Bloom County. Yet, he had not moved, save a few mid-slumber shudders as he acted out his heroics in a dream.

I approached the paper cautiously. I am not to blame here. We have all seen, dear reader, the fantastical stories of Stephen King take us from placid to terrified. I had been well-trained by horror authors. This was the culmination of my training.

I summoned my stealth and approached. The paper waited patiently. I inched forward with all the patience and skill of a lioness stalking her dinner. The paper was severely overmatched. It stood no chance against my predatory skills. It must have sensed that it was done for because it did not move. It put up no protest and allowed me to capture it with little effort. THE DAY WAS MINE!

I helped the paper rise triumphantly until I also looked up to admire my prey. There was something written on the paper, which was in fact a small piece of notebook paper that had been torn from the original notebook.

I could see where I had crumpled it, but now it was smoothed out, and I wondered by whom. Something? I kept my options open as I turned it over and then back. There, on one side of the paper, was the beginning of this story, or what I may one day call a nightmare.

Written in elegant handwriting was a strange two-sentence note.

It appeared to be some therapy session notes.

“Patient presents with species dysphoria and performance anxiety. Recommend exposure therapy and dietary adjustments.”

 

**SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE**

 “Grotesque!”

“Wha? I mumbled.

“The bookcase. It’s grotesque,” my wife grumbled as we stood in an antique store several years before I found “therapy” notes on my couch.

“I don’t…. It’s not grotesque, it’s just an older piece that probably needs a home and a little TLC.” As I gestured at the bookcase. “In fact, once I sand it a little and put a coat of paint on it, she will look like a new girl!”

“Oh, now it’s a “she.”  Great…. just friggin’ great”

The owner of the store was amenable to our offer for the bookcase. Well, I say “our,” but this became a one-man show after the third “grotesque” was uttered.

I inquired about the origin of the piece while we arranged for transport to our home. The owner was, hmmmmm, I guess “withholding” is the word I am searching for in this case. He was withholding. While he didn’t come out and say it, I suspected that he knew more than he let on. I wondered if this was obtained in an estate sale, which is always sad in nature. I have been to a few, and it seems the owners of those homes just up and walked out, leaving their worldly possessions neatly arranged on a table. With price tags. Next to a cash box. Depressing, nonetheless. Perhaps this antique bookcase carried with it the sorrow of its owners.

I didn’t feel good about asking more questions, especially in front of the woman who was happy to affix a label such as “grotesque” on a piece of furniture that had once had owners. I vowed to circle back as time permitted.

 **MADNESS**

The note I so courageously found on the couch was just the first of many anomalies that occurred with that bookcase.

This wasn’t “things that go bump in the night,” but it was something that was of concern. Things were happening that I could not explain. I’m not sure anyone could explain this. In fact, as I spoke with one of my colleagues, he suggested collecting evidence, writing reports, documenting the events, and then presenting them for review, opinion, and even resolution.

Madness seemed to overtake me with each event. I began a series of medications, believing that perhaps I was experiencing some hallucinations. At some point, I turned to Eastern Religions for help. Buddha was indifferent to my plight. Therapy came next, but I could not continue because my therapist likely thought me odd, if not dangerous. I had no desire to be imprisoned in a state facility trying to explain my obsession with my bookcase. Michel Foucault said about madness.

[""Madness is the punishment of a disorderly and useless science.""]() (“Michel Foucault - Madness and Civilization”)

Well then, Michel, let’s embrace all that is mad!

1nh19ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheReviewCircuit/comments/1nh19ik/should_you_buy_the_kidde_20sar_smoke_detector/,Should You Buy the Kidde 20SAR Smoke Detector Review for Enhanced Home Safety?,"**Detailed Review: Kidde 20SAR Smoke Detector**

Testing out the Kidde 20SAR Smoke Detector has been quite an insightful experience. As someone who's admittedly a bit of a safety and home improvement nerd, I've used several smoke detectors over the years, both for personal use and testing purposes. This one brings a blend of technology and practicality that genuinely surprised me. While it has some pretty fantastic features to boast about, a few quirks give room for improvement. Let me walk you through its finer points and areas that stood out.

**Design and Installation Experience**

Right out of the box, the modern design of this smoke detector caught my eye. Its modest 5-inch circular shape is sleek yet unassuming, making it blend seamlessly into various settings such as living rooms, hallways, or even bedrooms. Despite being hardwired, installing this device wasn’t much of a hassle. The included twist-and-click mounting bracket greatly simplifies the task. I had it completely set up in under 10 minutes with minimal effort; this would likely be the same even if you're relatively new to DIY installations. Its sturdy plastic build makes it lightweight but not at all flimsy. 

**Enhanced Sensing Technology**

As someone who burns toast far more often than they’d care to admit, the enhanced sensing technology was a game-changer. While testing, I intentionally created some smoke in the kitchen, and—thankfully—the alarm knew the difference between actual danger and overzealous cooking experiments. While sitting with my coffee nearby, I noticed the 85-decibel alarm kick in only when I cranked up the smoke challenge a bit. Coupled with this, the advanced technology complies with UL standards, ensuring top-notch safety and reliability.

**Pluses**

- The device comes with interconnect capability: when one alarm sounds, every connected detector triggers. This feature is particularly reassuring for larger homes.  
- Its three LED indicators were quite handy in differentiating states: green for normal functioning, amber for errors, and red for smoke detection.  
- Noise levels peak at an impressive 85 decibels, loud enough to ensure I couldn’t ignore it.  
- Comprehensively tested to meet UL 217 9th Edition standards and FCC expectations.

**Backup Features During Outages**

Living in an area subject to occasional power outages, the 2 AA battery backup felt like a thoughtful addition. Even during my self-simulated blackout test, the detector didn’t miss a beat, ensuring continuous safety monitoring. Moreover, the included batteries saved me a trip to the store—a slight but appreciated bonus.

**Practical Usability and Self-Testing Alarm**

What stood out more than anything else was the self-testing functionality. I admit, I sometimes procrastinate about manually testing alarms. This one actively ensures internal components function as expected. While users should still perform weekly manual push tests (something I admittedly skipped more often than not), knowing the auto self-test was running provided extra peace of mind.

**Limitations**

- False alarms, though minimal, did occasionally occur when I tested it close to areas like my fireplace despite its claimed enhanced sensing.  
- Not compatible with some older interconnectable models, requiring some users to upgrade existing detectors.  
- The unit, being hardwired, isn’t portable like some standalone alarm systems.

**Alternative Offerings**

In comparison with other detectors, such as the First Alert BRK 3120B, the Kidde 20SAR offers a far better user experience in tightly packed homes thanks to its interconnectivity feature. However, it does fall short when stacked against battery-only models like the X-Sense SD02, which offers more portability. That said, the Kidde device shines in its hardwired functionality, a feature absent in many battery-powered competitors. 

In areas where both power fluctuation and cooking-related activities are frequent, this device seems like a more favorable option compared to competitors. Its standard compliance coupled with noise volume and easy-to-read LED indicators definitely give it an edge in terms of safety metrics.

**Affordable Quality**

Although the exact price may fluctuate, I found its overall value to be worth the investment given the features it provides. The blend of reactive smoke detection, reduced false alarms, and self-testing capabilities makes this model feel like a long-term companion in ensuring safety rather than something you’d replace after a few months. Additionally, considering its 10-year limited warranty, you are essentially investing in a decade of functional reliability without added costs.

Change the narrative. If you spend one minute complaining about politics or the state of the world, spend two minutes sharing something positive. If you post one word sentence something down, post two sentences offering a solution. Instead of 10 minutes watching the news, spend 20 minutes researching solutions.

We already know the world has problems. What we don’t have enough of is people doing things  that actually work to make things better.

Here are some things you can actually do:

Vote in local elections. Your county sheriff, mayor, prosecutors, judges, and school board members shape our daily lives much more than the president ever will.
•    ⁠Block those fake accounts or hit the “x” button when Facebook serves you a clickbait news article. That tells Facebook you’re not falling for their shite anymore, and it stops rewarding garbage content.
•    ⁠Volunteer a few hours a month. It builds safer, stronger communities. Before you say you don’t have time, think of how much time you spend scrolling through FB feeds or Reddit subs
•    ⁠Show up to city council or school board meetings. Leaders pay attention to who’s in the room.
•    ⁠Go outside and pick up trash. Cleaner neighborhoods just look better and help people feel safer.
•    ⁠Walk or bike in your neighborhood. Safer streets and healthier communities follow when people are outside together.
•    ⁠Share positive news and real solutions twice as often as you complain. That’s how you flip the narrative.
•    ⁠If everyone skipped one meal out a month and donated that money to their favorite cause, those organizations wouldn’t need to worry about losing their funding through political whims. With what most people spend on coffee from a drive through, WVXU wouldn’t need to play Cincinnati Edition 10 times a week.
•    ⁠Stop perpetuating the Us vs Them mentality. Ask someone you disagree with to sit down and have a conversation that isn’t about politics.",2,1757879943.0,50501SouthDakota,0,1.0,False
1nh16km,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menieres/comments/1nh16km/chronic_flare_up/,Chronic flare up,"Hi all! I was finally diagnosed this week after almost 2 years of chronic illness, with the last almost year being heart and table tilt tests because my Dr suspected POTS. She put me on a high hydration, high sodium diet that created a chronic flare up for the last several months. We're talking incredibly loud constant tinnitus, balance issues, constant inflammation in my skull & sinuses (so lots of all over congestion), vertigo spells, fatigue, vision problems, migraines, etc... I'm also a SAHM to 3 littles. On Monday, my Dr and I finally realized why I was getting worse instead of better. Spoiler alert: because it wasn't POTS, it was Ménière's. I started meds on Monday and immediately cut my sodium intake. I've been feeling much better, but obviously not 100%.

Fast forward to today. I asked my husband to take the garbage out. He does so, but I can clearly tell he's irritated about it. He then says ""on days I work overtime, can you just take it out so I don't have to the next day?"". I respond with ""okay, but I felt really sick yesterday and the kids were kind of wild. I will try to keep that in mind. Just know that when it's been a crazy day and my symptoms are acting up, it's not easy to do. I'll try."" 

I thought my response was thoughtful, let him know my reasoning that it hadn't gotten done and that I would still try. Apparently he took that as me just giving excuses. Mind you, he KNEW how crappy I was feeling yesterday. He also left the half full french press carafe on the edge of the countertop yesterday, it got knocked over and coffee splashed all over the kitchen. (You'll see why I'm bringing this up.) I had messaged him just to ask if he could try to not leave it right on the edge of the counter. I said that I didn't blame him for it getting knocked over and that I would try to be more aware if it's on the edge, but asked that he try not to leave it there. I was met with ""I didn't know I did. I was running late and getting ready for work."" Okay, I just wanted to bring it to his attention and told him I'll try to be more mindful of it. I didn't take this as him giving me excuses, nor did I treat it as such. 

With this illness, how on earth do I convey that sometimes I feel like absolute garbage and that my body is just in survival mode all day these days? I'm just trying to make it through the day in one piece. This is the same man who, when he knew I was struggling with PPD, told me that I only need to worry about what I can get done; the other stuff can wait and he will help.

Then I woke up.  


There were only a few minutes left before my shift started. I quickly pulled myself together, left the house, and set out.  


ut the things I had seen stayed in my head all the way. In the dream, I was in a dark alley. I was running after someone. Everything was blurry, as if seen through a layer of mist. Then the woman fell. A hand rose into the air and a scream was heard.  


I didn’t even remember how I got to work. Fred waved at me. My closest friend at work. We chatted a bit. I handled the routine accounting tasks.  


It was a nightmare, just a nightmare.

The next night, I must have worked until about two in the morning. When I suddenly opened my eyes, I was in a secluded place, like between two buildings.  
“–Please don’t… Please… stay away.”  
I turned my head to the right. A male silhouette was lying on the ground. One hand was in the air, begging.  
“–Please…”  
The sound of a body being slashed cut off his words. Not even a scream was heard. Only the man’s last breath. I didn’t just hear it.  


I felt it.

When I woke up, I was at my desk. My desk lamp was on. My alarm was ringing on the side. With difficulty I reached out and turned it off. I was probably under too much stress at work. So many reports to prepare. So many things to document. My mind was so tangled, that must have been why I was having such dreams.

So here was another normal day. I had forgotten my nightmare. Until I went to bed that evening. I waited a bit at the head of the bed.  


What if I saw it again?  


After lying down, I couldn’t sleep for quite a while.  


Another nightmare.  


This time I wasn’t outside. I was inside a house, my footsteps echoing. A woman was sitting on the couch watching TV. She didn’t notice me. I was going toward her. Even when I tensed my body to stop, nothing changed. I saw the knife in my hand raised into the air. Suddenly, I grabbed the woman’s neck and…  
It’s better if I don’t write the rest.  


And again, I woke up. Covered in sweat.  


What was happening to me?  


I didn’t even remember how I got to work. When Fred saw me at the door, his eyes widened.  
“–Cillian, are you okay?”  
I didn’t want to worry him. I just told him I couldn’t sleep. He bought me a coffee and advised me to take a sleeping pill that night. Because of my condition, the idea of pills didn’t sound unreasonable. That night I took them and really did sleep well, relatively speaking. The next day I went to work more energetic. For the next few days I didn’t dream at all. I thought the nightmare ordeal was over.

About a week later, one night I suddenly heard crying. I was inside a huge warehouse, or somewhere like it. But this time, it was more familiar than the other places.  
It was the abandoned factory just outside the city. When the crying grew louder, I looked down. There was a man curled up on the ground. A sudden kick to his stomach made him curl up even tighter. His voice went silent. Moonlight filtered through the broken window above. I saw the glint of the knife’s sharp edge. And then, as always, I woke up.

I was a bit late to work. I ran into my grumpy boss. I was sure he was about to give me an hour-long disciplinary lecture. Luckily Fred stepped in, told him I wasn’t doing too well these days, and saved me.  
“–Thanks, man,” I said. Just as I turned to leave, he grabbed my arm.  
“–Cillian, what’s going on?”  
“What do you mean?”  
“–Coming to work sleepless, spacing out… Are you cheating on your wife?”  
“I’m not even married, Fred.”  
He laughed and slapped my shoulder.  
“–I’m joking, loosen up a bit.”  
I laughed with him. After all, he was my friend. I had no reason not to tell him what I was going through. I sat down and told him about the nightmares I’d been having. The less bloody versions, at least. By the time I finished, a thoughtful expression had settled on his face. I told him these were insignificant things. But he had taken them very seriously. In fact, I’d almost say… he was scared. He asked me a bunch of questions. What I felt in the dream, for example—not emotions, but concrete things: cold, light, humidity…  


To most of them, I just said I didn’t know.  


Finally, to reassure him, I added that I would see a psychologist and went back to my work.

That night on the way home, heavy rain started and lasted all night, I even remembered it while falling asleep.  


And while waking up.  


I could hear the rain more clearly, I was soaked. I was outside. There was a dumpster next to me. I couldn’t fully define where I was. On the edge of the sidewalk, I saw a man groaning. From his clothing, it was obvious he was homeless. He was shouting something. His collar was being grabbed and pulled up by someone. I saw that knife, the one that always ended my dreams; this time blood was dripping from its cold metal. The man whimpered in a higher pitch. The knife was about to fall and end him.  


But it stopped, in mid-air, for seconds.  


Suddenly I felt watched. Someone was looking at me. But I couldn’t see them. Yet I could swear.  


The homeless man’s eyes shifted away from the knife, to something else.  


Then the sound of the knife viciously tearing through the dirty coat roared in my ears. This time… it was different, crueler, angrier.  


I woke up, shivering. I pulled the blanket over me. It was still dark outside. I thought I’d sleep a bit more.  


But I was still cold. I pulled the blanket tighter. The blanket was cold too.  


Something was wrong.  


When I turned on the light, I nearly screamed at what I saw.  


I was wet, my bed was wet. Water was dripping where I stood. Water was flowing from me. Had I taken a shower in my sleep? Or…  


Realistic dreams… the sounds… the endless sleeplessness…  


In my right hand, something else was dripping along with the water.  


Blood.  


But I wasn’t wounded.  


There were stains on my pajamas too. Dotted.  


I remembered the rain, how much it had poured… it had stopped now, but.

Was it a dream? Or… wasn’t it? Did I kill them? All of them…  
I had done it.

I grabbed my phone and called Fred. Told him to come to my house. He asked me a thousand times what was going on and if I was okay. I just said come.  


Because he was the only one who wouldn’t call the police when he saw me like this.  


When he knocked, I ran to open the door. As I had guessed, the moment he saw me he covered his mouth with his hand.  
“–You… What have you done?”  
I let him in. I was shivering because I was soaked. I had already told him about the dreams I’d been having. I told him every detail of tonight’s as well.  
“–I woke up soaking wet, Fred. And there’s blood. There’s blood on me. I’m doing this. It’s not a dream.”  


His face took on the most serious expression I’d ever seen.  


“–I should go to the police… I should tell everything. I’ve killed all those people. I’m a serial killer. Maybe there are more I don’t even remember.”  


As I panicked, pacing around and talking, he weakly whispered my name.  


“–But I wasn’t doing it willingly, I didn’t know. The bodies… I don’t remember after killing them.  


He said my name again.  


“–Maybe they’re in my basement, maybe I buried them all there. God… I’ve been living for days on top of so many corpses.  


“–Calm down, Cillian.”  


There was not the slightest panic in his voice. He was watching me pace back and forth in the room.  


“How can I be? How can I calm down? I’m a serial killer, Fred! Your friend is a killer! How are you so calm?”  


Until then, I hadn’t noticed. He was sitting on the couch thoughtfully. No trace of panic on his face.  


“You’re not a serial killer.”  


“How can you be sure? There’s blood on me. I’m soaked. I killed that man.”  


“You didn’t. You watched.”  


I froze in place.  


“What?”  


“You watched them all, Cillian. I think… you’ve always been watching.”  


“How… How do you know this? How do you know I didn’t kill them?”  


“Because I did.”

I stumbled back two steps in shock. Before I could comprehend what he said, he spoke again.  


“I should have realized earlier. But you… you were like invisible somehow. I always felt it. I always knew I wasn’t alone with them. But when you talked about the dreams, everything became clear. Tonight I saw you, Cillian. You were watching me from the corner. Like a ghost. Then you vanished. You didn’t do it. But you watched.”  


Fred stood up. He came toward me.  


“I don’t know how this is happening. You… you’re some kind of Grim Reaper.”  


He grabbed the bag he had thrown into the hallway when he came in. I was frozen from shock as he walked past me.  


“I haven’t figured out what this is yet, Cillian. You’re not normal, you know that now. And I’m sure you won’t go to the police until you understand.”  


He looked into my eyes. It gave me the exact same feeling as when I thought I was being watched. As he left, I saw the bruise marks on his arm. They were shaped like finger marks, bruising his arm. That hand… the hand that rose into the air holding the knife…  


He slammed the door and left.

I still haven’t gone to the police. I don’t know what’s happening, what’s going on here. I’m writing this so maybe someone can help me. With paranormal things, or whatever field this falls into. Fred will come back for me.  


And I’m afraid the last thing I’ll watch will be my own murder.",1,1757879880.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Decided to take a 7 day break to reset tolerance to avoid continuously upping dosage. I feel no different today than the first day - no energy, no motivation, generally just feeling down. I have to force myself to do basic things that I'd normally jump at like groceries, dishes, working out, even showering.  

It's a nice reminder of how much vyvanse has helped me. Prior to being on it about two years ago I was feeling the same way 24/7. I'm going to stick to the one-week goal and start taking it again on Tuesday. Hopefully the break helped me.. somehow? Next time I think I'll just do two days. I thought the dopamine would start to go back to normal by now but it really hasn't. I've also quit booze entirely so that's definitely playing a role in how I feel.  

I've tried l-tyrosine in high doses and a ton of caffeine but it didn't help at all with energy. I've been sleeping 8-14 hours a day since starting this break, often waking up, having a coffee and then just going back to bed for 3-4 hours.

It's worth the investment.**

So I've been down the rabbit hole of coffee grinders lately. My old blade grinder finally died and I knew I needed to upgrade to a burr grinder if I wanted decent coffee. [Spent way too much time researching this stuff, but here's what I found:](https://thenested.com/best-burr-grinder-unlock-your-coffees-true-potential/)

[Baratza Encore ESP](https://thenested.com/best-burr-grinder-unlock-your-coffees-true-potential/) \- This is the sweet spot. Does both espresso and drip coffee really well, which most grinders in this price range can't pull off. The dual-range adjustment system is genius - micro steps for espresso, macro steps for everything else. Built like a tank and Baratza's customer service is legendary. Around $200.

[Fellow Opus ](https://thenested.com/best-burr-grinder-unlock-your-coffees-true-potential/)\- If you care about looks, this is your grinder. Stupidly quiet operation (great for early mornings) and handles every brewing method I threw at it. The anti-static tech actually works. Slightly more than the Baratza but worth it if aesthetics matter to you.

[Breville Smart Grinder Pro](https://thenested.com/best-burr-grinder-unlock-your-coffees-true-potential/) \- Feature overload in the best way. 60 grind settings, programmable timers, LCD display. My tech-loving friends swear by this one. Takes some learning but once you dial it in, it's incredibly convenient. Good value at around $200.

[OXO Brew Conical Burr](https://thenested.com/best-burr-grinder-unlock-your-coffees-true-potential/) \- Dead simple to use. One-touch operation, remembers your last setting. If you just want good coffee without fussing with settings, this is it. Super consistent results.

**Cuisinart Supreme Grind** \- The budget pick. Not going to lie, it's basic, but it gets the job done for way less money. If you're just starting your coffee journey or need something that works without breaking the bank, this will do it.

1nh0zs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1nh0zs4/comparing_3_studies_on_multibagger_stocks/,Comparing 3 Studies on Multibagger Stocks,"Decided to compare research from three studies about stocks that return 10-100x+ your money and share my findings here.

Here's what I read through:

* Christopher Mayer: ""100 Baggers"" (2015); Covered 1962-2014.
* Jenga Investment Partners (Dede Eyesan): ""Global Outperformers"" (2023); Covered 2012-2022.
* Anna Yartseva: ""The Alchemy of Multibagger Stocks"" (2025); Covered 2009-2024.

Clearly, these aren't apples-to-apples comparisons. Besides the time period differences, Mayer looked at 100-baggers using case studies. Jenga performed academic research on 446 global 10-baggers (not just US stocks), and Yartseva used statistical models on 464 NYSE and NASDAQ-traded stocks. These studies may suffer from survivorship bias as well.

Regardless, I think it's an interesting comparison to potentially understand recurring themes/patterns and identify any surprising findings.

# What Doesn't Matter

**Earnings Growth**

One of the most surprising findings was on earnings growth and how many investors/books say it's essential, including Mayer.

However, Yartseva's statistical analysis found that earnings growth was NOT a significant predictor of multibagger returns.

Specifically, she tested EPS growth, EBITDA growth, gross profit growth, operating profit (EBIT) growth, and net profit growth over both 1-year and 5-year periods. None were statistically significant in her dynamic panel regression models.

Interestingly, while Yartseva found earnings growth wasn't predictive, her winners still achieved impressive growth rates: 17.3% CAGR in operating profit, 22.9% in net profit, and 20.0% in EPS.

Eyesan found the average profitable company grew operating earnings at 20% CAGR.

**Industry**

Yartseva's 464 multibaggers came from several sectors, not just tech:

Information Technology (20%), Industrials (19%), Consumer Discretionary (18%), Healthcare (14%), and even traditionally slow-growth sectors like Utilities (1%).

Eyesan found similar sector diversity among his 446 global outperformers: Information Technology led with 25.8%, followed by Industrials (15.2%), Healthcare (14.1%), Materials (13.5%), and Consumer Discretionary (10.5%).

Notably, Information Technology, Healthcare, and Materials outperformed relative to their market representation. Tech represented 25.8% of winners but only 12.7% of the overall market. Semiconductors alone jumped from 1 outperformer in 2002-2012 to 44 in 2012-2022.

This broad distribution suggests screening by sector would eliminate many opportunities.

**Other Factors**

Yartseva's research also found several widely-tracked metrics showed no predictive power:

* Dividend policies (58% of multibaggers paid dividends at start, 78% by end - no correlation).
* Debt levels (debt-to-equity and debt-to-capital ratios didn't predict returns).
* Share buybacks (no statistical significance).
* Analyst coverage (being followed or ignored didn't matter).
* Altman Z-scores for bankruptcy risk (failed statistical tests).
* R&D spending relative to free cash flow (surprisingly no correlation with becoming a multibagger).

# What Actually Matters

**Company Size**

Every single study found that smaller companies outperform:

* Mayer: Median $500M market cap, with median sales of $170M.
* Eyesan: Found 63% of winners were nano-caps (<$50M market cap) in 2012, with only 7/446 winners (1.6%) being large caps.
* Yartseva: $348M median market cap in 2009, with median revenue of $702M. Notably, Yartseva found that small-cap stocks generated average excess returns of 37.7% annually, compared to 14.5% for mid-caps and 9.7% for large-caps.

This makes logical sense given it's easier to grow from a small base - a $100M company doubling is much easier than a $100B company doubling.

**Moats**

All three studies agreed on competitive advantages/moats. Companies need something protecting their profits from competition:

* Mayer: Emphasized economic moats as essential for durability. ""A 100-bagger requires a high return on capital for a long time. A moat, by definition, is what allows a company to get that return.""
* Eyesan: Found that outperformers typically had or developed competitive advantages.
* Yartseva: While acknowledging competitive advantages were important based on prior literature, she didn't isolate this as a specific variable in her models, instead incorporating it into overall business quality metrics.

**Patience**

They also agreed on patience:

* Mayer: 100-baggers took 26 years on average. Also emphasized the ""coffee-can"" portfolio philosophy.
* Eyesan: All 446 global outperformers achieved their 10-bagger status within 10 years (2012-2022 study period).
* Yartseva: 10-baggers ranged from 7.5 to 40.5 years, with her 464 stocks averaging 26-fold returns (21.4% CAGR) over 15 years.

**Revenue Growth**

Revenue growth was discussed across all studies:

* Mayer: Emphasized the need for significant growth but didn't specify a minimum rate.
* Eyesan: Found 15% CAGR average revenue growth in his winners.
* Yartseva: Found 11.1% CAGR median revenue growth in her winners.

**FCF Yield & Book Value**

Yartseva's statistical model confirmed free cash flow (FCF) to price ratio as the most important driver of multibagger stock outperformance.

In her regression models, FCF/P showed coefficients ranging from 46 to 82, while book-to-market (B/M) showed coefficients from 7 to 42. Together, a 1% increase in FCF/P and B/M ratios was associated with 7-52% higher annual returns.

FCF/P captures both the company's cash generation and what you're paying for it.

B/M ratios above 0.40 combined with positive operating profitability showed higher chances of positive returns in Yartseva's portfolio sorts.

However, Yartseva warns to avoid companies with negative equity (where liabilities exceed assets). Small-cap companies w/negative equity declined 18.1% annually, medium-caps fell 9.4%, and large-caps dropped 7.6%.

**Other Valuation Metrics**

Yartseva's winners started with median valuations of P/S 0.6, P/B 1.1, forward P/E 11.3, and PEG 0.8, all suggesting they were undervalued at the start.

Eyesan found that 48.9% of outperformers started trading below 10x EV/EBIT and 50.7% below 1x EV/Revenue, suggesting most winners begin at low valuations rather than high growth premiums.

Yartseva found EV/Revenue and EV/EBITDA were significant in some model specifications but lost significance in her more robust models, suggesting they matter but aren't as reliable as FCF/P.

**Profitability Threshold**

Profitability metrics appeared in all three studies but with different focuses:

* Mayer: Preferred 20%+ ROE.
* Eyesan: Focused on return on capital (ROC) and required it to be above industry average.
* Yartseva: Found just 9% median ROE but noted it was growing. Her winners started with modest profitability - gross margins averaged 34.8%, EBIT margins just 3.9%, ROC 6.5%.

Overall, profitability seemed to matter but nothing spectacular to start. Based on these studies, companies should ideally be profitable when you pick them, but you don't need amazing numbers - even 9% ROE may work if it's improving.

**Other Profitability Metrics**

Beyond ROE, several metrics are worth mentioning:

* Return on assets (ROA): Yartseva found coefficients of 0.4 to 1.9, meaning for every 1% increase in ROA, stock returns increased by 0.4% to 1.9% (which is small).
* Return on capital (ROC): Mayer called it critical, Eyesan required above-industry average, and Yartseva found 6.5% median in her winners.
* Operating (EBIT) margins: 82% of Eyesan's winners were profitable at the start, with median EBIT margin of 12%. Among profitable companies, those with >10% margins grew from 48% in 2012 to 85% by 2021; those with >20% margins grew from 17% to 47%.
* EBITDA margins: 30-60% for winners (Eyesan), confirmed significant by Yartseva whose models showed EBITDA margin as a statistically significant predictor with positive coefficients in her initial models.

Notably, according to Eyesan, 74% of winners grew earnings faster than revenue. This means companies were becoming more profitable over time, not just growing sales.

**Multiple Expansion**

Multiple expansion means the market paying more for each dollar of earnings over time (e.g., P/E going from 10x to 20x):

* Mayer: Described ""twin engines"" of earnings growth plus multiple expansion, showing examples of P/E expanding from 3.5x to 26x, which when combined with earnings growth created 100x returns.
* Eyesan: Found 91% of winners had EV/Revenue expansion and 72% had EV/EBITDA expansion.
* Yartseva: While Yartseva didn't isolate multiple expansion as a single variable, her findings strongly suggest valuation changes rather than earnings growth drive multibagger returns.

**Reinvestments**

All studies emphasized reinvestment capability, but with nuance:

* Mayer: Emphasized reinvestment as the most important factor - specifically companies that can reinvest profits at 20%+ returns consistently.
* Eyesan: Discussed how successful M&A strategies and aggressive expansion drove returns for many outperformers.
* Yartseva: Found that if a company's asset growth exceeds its EBITDA growth, returns drop 4-11%. This means companies must invest aggressively BUT only if their earnings are growing fast enough to support that investment.

**Ownership**

Mayer found 7% annual outperformance among owner-operators and quoted Martin Sosnoff's rule that management should own at least 10-20% of the company.

Yartseva noted owner-operators in her sample had significant vested interests (though she didn't test ownership as a specific variable).

Eyesan noted that 67% of outperformers had insider ownership above 5% (vs. 49% in the broader market), but didn't treat this as a defining factor. Instead, he emphasized qualitative signs of management-shareholder alignment like maintaining focus through acquisitions, proper capital allocation, and consistent execution of core strategy.

**Entry Timing**

For timing, buy beaten-down stocks:

* Yartseva: Stock should be near 12-month low at time of purchase.
* Mayer: Highlighted beaten-down, forgotten stocks returning to profitability as prime 100-bagger candidates.
* Eyesan: Found turnarounds deliver strong returns when problems are solvable (like fixing marketing inefficiencies or distribution issues, rather than fundamental product failures).

Yartseva also tested price momentum over various periods and found one-month momentum slightly positive, meaning stocks that rose last month tend to continue rising.

However, 3-6 month momentum was negative - stocks that performed well over the previous quarter or half-year tend to reverse, suggesting multibaggers are volatile and don't follow smooth upward trends.

**Macro Environment**

Interest rates matter. Yartseva quantified that rising Fed rates knock 8-12% off multibagger returns the following year.

This makes sense because multibaggers tend to be smaller companies that likely rely more on external financing and whose future cash flows are worth less when discount rates rise.

**Geographic Shift**

Lastly, Eyesan's data showed that 59% of recent 10-baggers came from Asia:

* India: 91 companies.
* USA: 60 companies.
* Japan: 49 companies.
* China: 34 companies.

This suggests that if you're only looking at US stocks, you're missing a lot of opportunity.

Moreover, this is striking given Asia represents only 10% of global mutual fund portfolios, suggesting massive underallocation to the region.

Eyesan also noted important regional differences in how earnings translate to returns. Markets like India, Japan, and the Nordics show good earnings-to-returns conversion efficiency, while markets like China and Latin America often see earnings growth that doesn't translate well to stock returns.

Think I was able to cover the key findings from these books/papers, but lmk if I missed anything!

Read the books/papers if you want a deeper understanding of their findings and for company-specific examples. I've also written about Mayer, Eyesan, and Yartseva's work in more detail (see my [newsletter archive](https://newsletter.stablebread.com/archive)).

Im new here. I had no idea this existed! I'm so happy!!! Because I swear im about to explode about my husband's mother!!! 

My husband and I are about to celebrate our 10 year anniversary.... 10 years with this.... interesting person. 

Its a lot but I'll try to keep it short lol. 

I didn't meet her in person until the weekend of our wedding. She lived out of state but I spoke to her on the phone. I didn't like her from the get-go, but i left hope alive. She told my husband that she wanted to financially help with the wedding.  We didnt ask. She offered. Months later, my husband asked if she still planned on helping. She said he needed to be a man and handle it himself. Strike 1. 

Second issue was 11 months later when I was in labor with our first baby. I told my husband I didnt want anyone there while I was in labor except my mom and sister. He calls his mom anyway!!! Im a very private person and I dont know this woman enough to have her there while im in a such a vulnerable situation! So my sister kindly asked her to leave (I've got the best sister!!) and this woman has the nerve to say ""Im here to support my son"". I was livid!!! But she left and I was happy! 

I cant remember the order of offenses after that, but she asked to live with us in our 1 bedroom apartment with a newborn (didn't happen). She asked us for money to fly her sister (my husband's aunt) out for vacation... no family emergency, just to visit. We said no. 

Then when she saw that her son's wife wasn't giving into her needs to be taken care of (she's super entitled and leeches off of everyone who will allow it), she started pulling away. Probably thinking we'd cave. Nope!! 

We had two more kids (a daughter when our oldest was 15 months and another son 11 months after that). Nothing really meaning from her. I wrote her nice letter saying that she was welcomed to be in our kids lives. She called my husband because she was insulted by my letter and lied on me about the contents of the letter. Mind you, i read it to my husband before I sent it and he said it was really nice.) 

Still, a year later, I thought things were getting better when she (reluctantly) agreed to sit with our kids while I had a work assignment for a week and my husband worked his two jobs. She tried to get out of it twice, but whatever. She actually showed up. She was supposed to stay at our house, but she didn't and made me late every single day! But still, after she left that last day I sent a message saying thank you and anytime you want to visit the kids she was more than welcome. She replies with ""A simple thank you would suffice."" What?!!! My husband contacted her, her sister and my SIL said that she needed to apologize. So she did. I told her that I know she didnt like me and that since you needed so much convincing to apologize im not sure exactly what to do with that. 

I got married with every intention and desire to have a great relationship with my in laws. I invited  her over, cooked for her, made coffee, conversed. Im a very hospitable person! Thats important to me to make people feel welcomed. But I wasn't going to let her call the shots in my marriage. Thats for my husband and I to figure out together. 

It started getting really yucky soon after. My SIL started spreading lies about me saying I didn't speak to people when I came around, that i was rude, just a whole lot of stupid lies! Mind you, my SIL lost her apartment shortly after our wedding and my husband and I gladly let her stay with us. I cleaned up after her, cooked for her, let her take over our living room. 

Then my husband's mom got involved. She started lying to everyone in their family about me! To the point where names of people I supposedly offended didn't like me either. I kindly contacted those people to find some validity and they said they had no issue with me whatsoever. I got nasty text messages from my SIL and my husband got conference called by his mother and sister telling him how horrible I was. But my husband told them ""Until you fix this with my wife. Don't call me again."" His mom ignored that. She showed up at his job and tried to buy him off. He told her to go. 

We didn't have contact for over a year. We reached out to her and had a conference call with my SIL and my husband's mother. They told me the ridiculous issues they had with me that were totally unfounded. I explained why it was stupid and they kind of apologized. At that point, a real apology was action. That was about 5 years ago. 

Since then, she told my husband that she'd rather me get my tubes tied than him get his vasectomy (like she has any room for opinion in that area of our lives), asked to move into our house because my SIL weren't getting along (my husband said no), she progressively ignores my kids more and more. My children have Autism. But theyre hilarious, brilliant, loving, fun kids that adore the people in their life! She's said it our job to make sure she has a relationship with them (WHAT?!!) But, in my opinion, if you show absolutely no interest in the kids, then why would we keep trying? Im not going to force my kids on anyone because what does that teach my kids? That you have change who you are for someone else's acceptance? Absolutely not! 

Last thing... during a more recent phone call with my husband (after cutting him off for almost a year) he said he's not going to force our kids on her. She got mad. But the funny part is, when she was saying everything wrong with us: she didn't approve of how fast we got married, she accused me of being pregnant at the wedding (when she got married after 3 months of dating and was pregnant at her wedding after already a child with someone else), she called my family (who cooked for HER daughter's baby shower and who my mother treated to lunch) ""pigeons among eagles"" (meaning my family and I are beneath them). Then there was the time she gave my kids (3, 4 and 5 at the time) toys for Christmas (in March) that were meant for infants. As a parent of kids with Autism, that was insulting. When I brought this up to her during the phone call, she said it wasnt her job to know how old her grandkids were. Never apologized... just played Hot Potato with accountability, as always. 

Last weekend, we went to our nieces birthday party (she planned and everything) and she ignored my kids again. Then the only time she engaged was when she hurt my youngest son's feelings over touching another kids toy (that was left alone not being touched). She could've had died that like a grandma and not embarrass him the way she did. He doesn't even know her. He shut down the rest of party. 

Im so done with this woman!! But at the same time, im trying to find some area to work with her! Am I crazy?!

He is a full fledged demon surrounded by humans. And when I see how Kagome’s time is overrun with humans, only thinking demons as myths and legends, I feel sad when I think about the world he is literally just a remnant of.

His mother is a rich airhead, only casually knowledgeable about anything real in life.

Everyone around him either blindly adores him or wants to kill him for glory. He looks so alone on this show.

I saw how mentally unprepared he was for Rin’s death when he was in the underworld and the reality that one day even with his best efforts, he’ll lose her and be all alone again.

I wish to craft my own character for him, an eternal partner of sorts, a bitch to the beast, one that’s been gone far too long (her own duties to fulfill and such)

Rather than the problem be her being a human, the problem will be she is a foreigner. One who was chased out of her homeland by humanity. And told she didn’t belong anywhere else.

The only person he wanted to protect.

I want to craft demons as people too, people that are slowly losing their sanity as humanity overruns the world. Their not able to blend in with them, and so they are reduced to the shadows.

A light in the darkness. You people all watched the woman who loved Sesshomaru.

I wish to write a story about the woman who left him.

Would this be interesting?

* In **paid apps**, I wonder if it feels redundant or even off-putting—like, “I already paid, why are you asking again?”

Hello, I'm a 13 trans ftm. I just have a few questions or just listen to this rant or what I am.
Ive been trans for about 2-3 years, and no this isn't some phase..

I'll listen some questions, my intentions are not to be disrespectful. 

Some of the questions I have is
- Is gender identities or sexualities a sin? 
- What if a queer is a christian, is that possible?
- Why is some christians so against of lgbtq+, is there anything in the Bible that says anything against it? and how would that work since god is supposed to be all about love?
- any sins that are unforgivable?
- how are you sure god and jesus is real even though a person from the 6 and 4 BCE stated that he healed with magic or came back alive the next day?
- when praying, how do you talk to god?

Little stories

Throughout my life I was brought to church often, and they would state that god loves you unconditionally but then when it comes to lgtbq they start shaming it

sometimes I drink coffee and one time I was with my family at church and some women approached me and began talking anoit the gospel. I didn't mind I was just sipping coffee. She asked why I was drinking coffee and I responded with ""oh just energy"" because I get sleepy at church because of the peaceful vibe and she began ranting about how I should pray for god to give me energy and made me stop drinking coffee. I didn't mind how faithful she was for god, what bothered me is how she said how would god give me energy. Then later when the priest began asking people who didnt feel like they deserve god or something I raised my hand. this woman got so uncomfortably close and held my shoulders I just wanted to be gone.. idk if that meant anything though

Another story is that I was a bit of a weakling but like to use energy and be strong, also be prepared just incase I get into trouble in the future, so I wanted to do martial arts. He told me that god will give me strength, okay imagine I'm fighting someone with my ass being inexperienced and weak! 😭

I used to be bullied alot at school to the point I would struggle with mental health, and some kids at the church would bully me and that definitely made me feel like ass. Arent we supposed to be kind? No bullying or anything? Especially at church??

Despite all this, I do believe that god is real, its just that I dont know if what I am is a sin, I am not changing myself to please a god whos supposed to be loving unconditionally. I love living, I just use logic instead of faith if that were to make sense. I'm also afraid that I could possibly go to the pits of hell for being trans or not spreading the gospel. I dont know if I should call myself a christian, Im aware god exists. I just dont talk about him, I dont even know how to talk to him, I pray, but not so much, i dont even know if i mean the words of the prayer. 

All this, I believe god is real, but I dont know if I'll devote my life for him. I just want to know your guys opinions to all this, and if I'm alright or anything. If you answer my questions please cite some texts from the Bible and explain so I understand 🥲",0,1757878929.0,AskAChristian,6,0.29,False
1nh0q1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/moneyadvice/comments/1nh0q1g/small_habits_that_saves_big_money/,Small habits that saves big money.,"I’ve been living in London as an international student for a year now. I work part-time, and yes, I don’t use my parents’ money. I pay my tuition fee and living expenses by myself. Those living in London know how expensive it is out here. I will give you the tips that I have tried and that I have heard from my friends (all of my friends are broke like me).

1. Carry a water bottle whereveryou go.

I know this sounds weird, but it really saves you from spending money on buying water. Trust me.

2. Not buying coffee.

Buy yourself a coffee mug and just make coffee at home and take the mug with you. (I only drink black coffee with sugar, so it’s easier for me to make coffee, and yes, I’m lazy but still make it and take it with me whenever I’m going out to work or uni in the morning.)

3. Eating at home

I have gone out to eat only one time since I came to London. If you guys want to go out with friends, but if you are reading this post, I’m sure you are in a shit place in life. In this part of your life you don’t need a social life, you need money.

4. Tracking every single exercise.

Tracking money really affects the savings. I think by tracking every exercise, it gives you the psychological pressure not to spend more because you can see that chips, soft drinks, coffee, etc., which you thought were only £3 or £4, add up to £60-£100.


5. finding cheap accommodation

Go to Facebook and search for a group specifically for the accommodation, you can find some families renting just a room in their house. This is a game changer, I only pay £550 for rent. (I think people spend around £1200 for rent)



There are many other things that you can do to save money, but I think this post will just get long and boring (actually I’m just too lazy to type). Believe me, this tip is from a person who pays his tuition fee and living expenses by himself just from working part-time.

I’m always the one to bring up the idea of hanging out, too. On the occasion that I do see them, it seems like they are genuinely having a good time and being glad that I’m there. I have enough of a sense of humor to make them laugh sometimes. Usually though, when they come over it’s mostly for some other reason.
My oldest sister comes over to hang out with my mom, and my older sister sometimes does that too but she usually comes over because there’s a holiday or other event. I also have a best friend who I’m actually in romantic love with, but her attention to me is quite little. The only hangouts (digital or physical) we ever really have happen because there’s a new Nintendo Direct livestream happening, a new video game came out and she wants to play it with me, or it’s our birthdays (we have almost the same date.) More recently, she let my older sister borrow her Switch 2 and later took it back, using hangouts with me to facilitate it. For every single hangout, my best friend genuinely seems to be glad to be there and happy to be spending time with me, with no signs of doing so reluctantly or solely out of guilt that she gives me very scarce attention.
So if that many of my loved ones treat me that way, surely I’m the problem, right? And I think it may be because there isn’t that much substance to my character. Playing video games is my top hobby, and I can get deep into certain categories of games. Souls games, hard NES games, party games, or games with user-made content. My other hobby is passively consuming information from coffee experts, while being a casual at making pourovers and not knowing how to perceive complex flavors. My job is at a kitchen and I rarely have any interesting stories to tell compared to my oldest sister and the tea that she spills. I have gone outside a little bit, but the extent of it is going to places that center themselves on food. I ride my bike to one coffee shop, one restaurant, and one bar. I feel like those may be all the main details to my character. Maybe there are some intricate aspects to my personality, but the big picture of myself is perhaps just a plain burger.
I also met someone new recently who I went on a date with. My best friend doesn’t reciprocate my romantic feelings, so I’m trying to date around to redirect my desire for that kind of intimate relationship. I intended to have an intimate relationship with this new person, but she said that she got platonic friend vibes. So I’m still interacting with her and we have friended each other on the Switch, and the most we’ve done after the date is plan to play online Mario Kart, but fail to follow through with it via the new friend remaining silent that night.
It feels kind of frustrating. Anytime someone I love comes to visit and I’m happy I get to hang out with them, it feels like I only have tangential value to some other reason why they’re here.

I took it upon myself to change my life instead of ending it. The first step was to reclaim my sensuality. I realized that a lot of my sadness came from my inability to enjoy life at its face value, savoring sensual pleasures instead of living on “auto-pilot.” 



I started meditation and mindful walks, and I began to carve out segments of my life that I dedicate to fully enjoying. The taste of cinnamon on my tongue from my morning cup of coffee. The burst of flavor from carefully chewing my food. The feeling of sunlight on my skin. The beautiful melody of gymnopedie no 1. Basically, I began to fill my robotic life with color, and I began to enjoy my life. I could go 10 minutes at a time without dissociating in only two days. 



I continued with my routine today, starting with my meditation, but it was interrupted by yelling (I’m an 18 year old male I live in my family home as I could not afford to dorm). After taking a step back and monitoring my dissociative thoughts, I realized that a lot of my trauma comes from my verbally abusive explosive BPD mother and my physically abusive sociopath father. This context is important because her yelling usually sets off my father, who attacks her. 



I’ve lived in this situation my whole life, so I recognized the impending violence and cut my meditation short to escape to my sensual “mindful walk”, only this time, everything was different.  I usually battle my own mind to remain present, but this time, it was especially difficult. I felt short glimpses of being “in the moment” where I could feel the beauty of life, the warm sunlight, and the cooling wind. But during these glimpses, I also felt immense pain. I felt like at any moment, my being could capsize. I felt weak, helpless, empty, afraid of what I might walk in on when I returned home–afraid for my mother, angry at my mother, angry at my father. I also felt physically nauseous, with my head pounding. I could not control the intrusive thoughts of finding my mother dead, bleeding out on the floor or worse at the hands of my father. Outside of these glimpses, I felt detached from my own body, the same sense of robotic, dreamlike stupored state that I’m used to.



 Eventually, I stopped fighting my body, and I allowed myself to continue walking without mindfulness and sensuality. This experience allowed me to finally realize what it means to be “triggered” (a term I never connected with). I realized that my whole life, my “auto-pilot” (depersonalization, dissociation, derealization) was protecting me from other pains. Like my body quite literally traded the sensual pleasures of life and true happiness for protection from immense pain,

Also called the MENA Aid initiative, each of MFA’s partners is contributing their respective positioning and expertise to overcome the unique challenges of aid delivery in Gaza. Before ceasefire collapsed in March 2025, we directly provided more than 100,000 vulnerable families with:

Food  – rice, pasta, flour, canned provisions, oil, cheese, eggs, fruits, vegetables, coffee, sugar, spices

Winterization supplies – clothing, shoes, tents and shelter kits, insulation materials, greenhouses

Essential materials – plates, cups, cutlery, garbage bags, cleaning products

Since resuming our field activities in late May, we have been steadily increasing our volume of deliveries to both northern and southern Gaza. 

As of July, MFA has been the only organization delivering ready-to-eat food baskets directly to families in need throughout northern Gaza; we are the only NGO outside of UN agencies with access in this area.

And I ate about 10 bites of an omelet and it was really good! Had a cup of coffee and then tried to just settle down my brain a bit snd keep going. I just couldnt. I got upset so I excused myself and just impulsively threw up. Im still upset, hours later. I dont wanna do it, I dont like it, but its like a craving and I hate it! I want to just feel normal. 
Does anyone have any personal tips on things that kinda help settle their urges? Something healthy. Replacing one bad habit with another like smoking or something is not exactly something I want to do like some suggest. Im more thinking long term. Maybe a better outlet ",1,1757878076.0,EDAnonymous,0,1.0,False
1nh0dyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nh0dyg/my_dads_connections_killed_me/,"My Dad's ""connections"" killed me.","My Dad’s friend has... connections.

Whenever my family runs into the slightest inconvenience, it's solved in a heartbeat. Mom was fired from her job, only to be promoted to a higher position hours later. 

Grandpa had terminal brain cancer and was miraculously cured within a week. 

It's almost like my family had their own personal fairy godmother.

All Dad had to do was ring his friend Mike, who pulled strings that I never saw.

I used to joke that if Mike ever died, his funeral would be attended by a mysterious man standing under a black umbrella.

Dad said it was never *that* serious, though over the years I noticed Mike fixed *all* of our problems.

My brother got into his dream college without even trying. He didn't even graduate high school, yet somehow got into Harvard, thanks to Mike’s connections.

So, I chose not to even *try* in my first year of college, moving back home and getting a job at the mall. I wanted to be a photographer, not a doctor, which was what my father insisted on.

Mike *did* get me into a prestigious medical school, but I was scared of blood. I told him multiple times I wouldn't be able to stomach it.

Dad was pissed, sure, but he didn't say anything, allowing me to stay for the summer to sort my thoughts out.

He told me Mike could easily get me into another school abroad, but I kept telling him:

I didn't *want* to be a doctor.

That was Dad’s dream, not mine.

I did ask if he could get his *connections* to find me a summer job in photography, but Dad was adamant that both of his children were going to medical school. Which sucked.

I understood Dad wanted us to be successful, but I hated blood. The idea of slicing into a human body made me nauseous.

I mean, come on, I couldn't even handle horror movies.

My brother was training to be a surgeon. Somehow.

Which was weird, since just a year prior, he attempted to leave home with his girlfriend to pursue his passion.

I hadn't spoken to him in a while, but Dex  suddenly dropped his love for acting and dumped his girlfriend.

He and Elena were engaged, and he just *left* her like that.

Like he never even loved her.

I still remember the night before he ran away. Dex told me to do the same.

*There's something wrong with Mike,* my brother told me, sitting on my bed.

Dex had been suspicious of Mike since we were kids and our father’s friend had stopped us from getting sick. We had the stomach flu once during middle school and hadn't been sick since.

Which was crazy, right? Mom didn't seem fazed, and Dad insisted we just had *really* good immune systems.

Dex was convinced it was witchcraft.

I was skeptical, leaning more towards *Mike has connections.*

Suddenly, my brother was a completely different person.

I knew siblings grew apart when they left for college, but this was on a whole other level. Dex never answered my texts or calls, and when he did, he was either studying, in night classes, or with his smart-ass friends. 

Growing up was a given, I knew that. But Dex became a stranger I couldn't stand. He was a whole other boy who happened to wear my brother’s face.

Dex was too different at Thanksgiving dinner, too formal, like he'd been possessed by royalty, talking in depth about his classes and that he was the top-ranked student. That wasn't Dex.

I knew it wasn't my brother, because Dex hated being categorized. 

He also HATED Harvard. 

'Dream school' my ass. 

He could barely focus in school, his teachers insisting on him being screened for ADHD, which Dad refused. 

Because, in Dad’s eyes, we had to be perfect. 

I jokingly commented that Dex didn't even graduate high school, just to shut him up, and Dad almost choked on a mouthful of turkey. Mom pursed her lips around the rim of her wine glass. 

Dex hadn't spoken to me since, completely under our father’s spell. 

When we were kids, my brother left me little notes to reassure me that I was going to be okay. He'd hide them in sofa creases and slip them under my door. Except when I searched his room, there was nothing, only the ghost of who Dex used to be. 

His application for a drama school in New York was still on his dresser, crumpled under old movie posters and textbooks, covered in coffee stains. He'd only written his name.

I laughed at that. 

*That* was Dexter. Distracted by everything. 

It was 2am when Dad pulled me out of bed.

“Huh?” wiping sleep from my eyes, I blinked at him, confused. 

“Get in the car,” Dad told me. “We’re going out.”

I didn't like the idea of going out at 2am, but sure, a father daughter car-ride sounded fun. 

Sliding onto cool leather seats, hesitantly, I was still wrapped in my blanket, still sleepy, my head pressed against the car window. It was freezing cold, I was shivering. When I was a little more awake, my mind drifting into fruition, a father daughter car ride was sounding progressively less appealing. 

I noticed Dad was driving us out of town, which was out of character. 

Dad hated going out of town. I couldn't help it, a shiver of panic slipping down my spine. I could feel my heart start to skip in my chest, my stomach twisting into uncomfortable knots. “Where are we going?”

He didn't reply, cranking the radio up, which left me to stew in the silence, and the sound of my heart pounding faster. 

Pressing my face against the glass, I blinked at the long, winding road, blanketed oblivion in front of me. 

We were in the middle of rural Virginia, and my phone was dead, so I couldn't even text Mom. 

I did have several locations in my head, though neither of them justified 2am. 

Couldn't Dad have waited until morning? 

The thought suddenly struck me. Was grandpa sick? 

The more I thought about it, the sicker I started to feel. I hated the dark, and it was the kind of dark that felt almost empty, hollow, like there was no ending and the road would continue forever. 

The dark has always felt suffocating to me, and being enveloped in pitch black open oblivion, I had a sudden, overwhelming urge to jump out of the car. 

There were no streetlights, and the further away we were driving from home, from safety, panic was starting to choke my throat. I couldn't breathe, suddenly, clasping my hands in my lap. 

“Dad,” I said, my voice a sharp whisper I couldn't help. “Where are you taking me?”

When Dad didn't answer, only stepping on the gas, I kicked his seat. 

“Dad!”

Dad’s fingers tightened around the wheel. 

“Shopping,” was his only response. 

Shopping? My mind whirred with questions. 

At 2am?

When I leaned back in my seat, my  hands delving between the gaps by habit, I pulled out a folded piece of card. 

I thought it was trash, but peering at it, something was written in black ink. 

When a streetlight finally appeared, a sickly glow illuminating the note, I  found myself staring at a single word written in my brother’s old writing.

Dex’s handwriting had drastically changed. 

For example, on my recent birthday card, he signed his name in perfect calligraphy. 

But I knew his old writing, his scrappy scribbles that were hard to read, which was exactly what I was staring at, and it was unmistakable, something I couldn't ignore, even when I tried to push down that panic, that drowning feeling starting to envelop me. 

*RUN.*

My gaze flicked to the front. Luckily, Dad wasn't paying attention. 

“Shopping?” I said shakily, my hand pawing for the lock on the door. 

My  breaths were heavy, suddenly, suffocated in my chest, I couldn't trust them. I maintained a smile, but I felt like I was fucking drowning, Dex’s note grasped in my fist. Sliding across the seat, I tried the other door. Also locked. 

“Yeah. Shopping,” Dad hummed. “We’re out of milk.”

“But there are no stores open.” I managed to choke out. 

I was all too aware of the car slowing down, and I was already planning my escape, my mind felt choked and wrong, and there were so many questions. If Dex had been on this exact car ride, then what happened to him? 

Mike was my top suspect. 

If Dad’s friend with connections could turn my brother into a stranger, then he could do anything to me. 

Weighing my options, I feverishly watched my father find a parking spot. 

I had to think straight. If I didn't, I was going to end up like Dex. I had a plan, sort of. If I dove over the front seat when my father wasn't looking, I would be able to get away. I had no plan for after that. I was just focusing on getting out of the car. 

However, when I was ready to leap over the seat, Dad stopped the car and jumped out. I tried to shuffle back, tried to inch toward the left door, but Dad was already grasping my arm and pulling me out of the car. In my panic, I dropped the note, stumbling out into cool air tickling my cheeks. The night should have felt like any other, and yet I was standing in the middle of nowhere. 

The sky above was too dark, and there were no stars. 

I was going to run, before I glimpsed building loomed in the distance. 

The place reminded me of a warehouse, or even a facility, a silver monolith cut off from the rest of the world. 

There was a lake nearby, and nothing else. 

Dad grabbed my hand gently, though his grasp was firm, a subtle order to stay by his side. 

He flashed his ID card at a guard, pulling me towards automatic doors lit up in eerie white light. 

My panic twisted into confusion, relief washing over me like warm water. Dad was right. It *was* a shopping centre. 

When we entered, and I found myself mesmerised by a labyrinth of aisles, we passed a section of canned food, and then snacks and medical supplies. 

Studying each aisle, I was in awe. Survival equipment, diapers, and a whole aisle dedicated to college textbooks.

What was this place? 

It was like a super Costco. 

When I reached for a cart, Dad kept pulling me further down each aisle, and the deeper I was dragged into this place, what was being sold started to contort in my vision, like I was in a nightmare. The lights above started to dim, the goods being sold twisting into things I didn't want to see. 

Stomach lining in vacuum packaging, and then a racoon skeleton. 

I was comforted by a section of whipping cream and baking soda, before we turned a corner, a sudden blur of twisted red slamming into me. 

It was all I could see, stretched straight down the aisle. 

I thought it was fish at first, fresh fish being sold early. 

Except each bulging mass of red my father and I passed was unmistakably human. 

“Dad,” I rasped, glimpsing a human heart sitting on display, encased in ice. 

“What is this place?” 

I started to back away, but I couldn't stop staring. 

I found myself in a trance, following my father. It was like stepping into an emergency ward. I had been there once, and never again. I hated blood, and it was everywhere, smearing the floor and shelves.

I don't know if I was in shock, before reality started to hit me in what felt like electroshocks. 

There were body parts for sale, both dead and alive, human brains both separate, and being sold with their bodies. 

People. 

Normal people put on display, their skin marked with red pen highlighting specific parts of them. 

I saw women, their faces circled and marked with different prices. 

Men, covered in brightly coloured tags advertising features. 

Coming to a halt, my body wouldn't… move. 

I couldn't fucking breathe. 

“Lily.”

Dad pulled me in front of one sign in particular. *Intelligence (17-25)*

I saw others. 

*Intelligence. 25-30*

*Intelligence. 30-40*

The advertisement showed a group of smiling teenagers mid-laugh.

Underneath: *”Give your children the greatest gift ever!”*

I should have been glued to it, trying to figure out what *Intelligence* meant, except my gaze wasn't on the sign, or even my father, already forking out cash. 

I was dizzily aware I was taking steps back, but I couldn't bring myself to move, to twist around and run. We were too deep into the store, and the exit was so far away, a labyrinth I knew I wouldn't be able to get through without my legs giving way. 

The store owner greeted my father, and I had to breathe deeply to stay afloat. 

Dad introduced himself as a friend of Mike, though his voice didn't feel real, drifting in and out of reality. 

The display said *Intelligence*, but that didn't make sense.

A guy stood in front of me, with blondish-brown hair and wide, dilated pupils. 

He was dressed in a simple white shirt and shorts, looking almost high. 

Despite his eerie grin, I noticed he was trembling, his hands pinned behind his back. He stood perfectly straight, chin up, eyes forward, like a puppet on strings. It wasn't until my eyes found his forehead, where his IQ had been written in permanent marker, that I realized what the store was advertising. 

Then I found the subtle tube stuck into the back of his hand. 

Drugged. 

“Ben is our smartest!” the man gushed, like he was selling a car. “He was donated a few weeks ago. Apparently, he tried to kill himself! Who would have thought, right? A smart kid like that trying to end it! Anyway, he's been fully checked. The kid graduated early, attended Cambridge University in England, only to move back home and attempted on Christmas Eve.” 

The stall owner's voice slammed into me like waves of ice water, and I remembered Dex’s sudden change in personality. 

Like he was a *different person.*

Something warm slithered up my throat, and I slapped my hand over my mouth. 

I couldn't take my eyes off of the *intelligence* being paraded in front of me.  

This nineteen year old boy with a crooked smile, freckles speckling his cheeks. 

This kid, who had a life, a family and friends, and a reason why he chose to die.

Reduced to an empty shell with a high IQ.

The owner gestured to the kid, who didn't even blink, didn't dare make eye contact with me. 

“No.” I said, and then I said it louder, twisting around.

I needed to get away. 

I needed to run. 

There were three guards in front of me. 

Following the store owner’s order to restrain me, they did, hesitant when my father barked at them not to hurt me. 

“I can assure you, your daughter will have a sparkling career.” The stall owner was smiling widely, and I screamed, struggling violently. 

“I'll take him,” Dad said, unfazed by my cries. “How much is he?”

“950,” the man said. “Since my wife has done business with you before, consider it a discount.” He turned to the boy with a laugh. “Ben is a good boy, so the process should take about three hours. Usually, after the removal, the brain can go into shock and sometimes shut down due to trauma. It may take weeks, or even months, for it to fully settle into its new body.”

His smile widened, and I heaved up my meagre dinner, spewing all over the guard. 

When I screamed, my cries were muffled, suffocated, I felt like I was choking. I was going to fucking die. 

*I have to get out of here*, my thoughts were paralysed, fight or flight sending my body into a manic frenzy. 

I wanted to find comfort in the boy on sale. 

But he kept smiling, wider and wider, oblivious he was standing in a slaughterhouse. 

Ben didn't fight back when another guard grabbed him. 

Instead, he was like a doll cut from his puppet strings, limp and unresponsive. The man ripped the price tag off Ben’s cheek, and he didn't even flinch. 

“It's your lucky day, boy,” the guard chuckled. “You're finally getting a body.""

Ben just smiled, swaying to the left, almost losing his balance. 

The store owner was still speaking, and I took the opportunity to headbutt a guard. 

He let go instantly, but I dropped to my knees, disoriented. 

I was free. But I didn't know where to go.

Everything was blurry, twisted and contorted red.

“Run!” was all I could shriek at Ben, who didn't even blink.

“He can't hear you.” The store owner laughed, like it was funny. 

Like he was telling a fucking joke. 

“Intelligence is shipped to us directly from conversion. All nice and packaged for sale. Everything else is gone, kid. You're talking to a blank slate.""

When I was yanked to my feet again, I felt numb.

“However,” the owner rolled his eyes, “like I said, Ben wanted to die,” he chuckled. “I’m confident he won’t fight back. They usually don't, but if he does, you’re free to return him within thirty days, just like all our products. Oh, and don’t worry—the mind has been wiped of personality. Only his IQ and achievements remain. The  core identity is removed during the conversion to avoid… let’s call them complications.”

“Complications?” Dad’s tone darkened. “Like what?”

“Oh, it's nothing to worry about! We have had instances of what we call *revival*, which is essentially, uh,” the store owner was stumbling over his words. “Well, what happens when you factory reset your iPhone?”

“It erases everything.” Dad said. 

The man nodded. “Yes. However, in some rare instances, fragments can be left behind. In the case of the human brain, memories can cling on, and in rare occurrences, so can consciousness. Mr Charlotte, I’m not saying it will happen, but if you have any problems, feel free to bring him back and we will provide a full refund.”

Dad nodded slowly. “Then I'll take him.”

I stopped breathing, my body going still. 

Was this really happening? 

Was I going to die? 

“Dad,” I whispered, when my father cupped my cheeks and told me to be brave. He told me I was his strong little girl. I did try. I fucking tried to nod, like I was accepting it, before clawing his eyes out. I tried to use soothing tones, but they weren't working. 

I resorted to screaming at him. 

I told him he was dead to me, that he was a psychopath. I really thought it might wake him up, make him realize that I  was his daughter. 

I wasn't a caricature of what a successful daughter should be. 

I was his fucking daughter. 

“Dad!” 

Except he didn't listen, his hands tightening on my shoulders.

“You want to be smarter, don't you, Lily?” 

“No!” an animalistic shriek ripped from my throat.

“Yes, you do.” He smiled through gritted teeth. “I'm going to make you smarter, all right? Just like your brother, sweetie.”

I tried to attack him, screeching like a wild animal. 

I did try to run, biting down on a guard’s hand. But it was my father pulling me back which brought reality crashing down. 

I was going to die. 

I stopped trying to get away, stopped crying, when I was picked up and thrown over a guard's shoulder. 

I remember being pinned down on an ice cold surface, a cruel prick in my neck numbing my limbs, and silver blades whirring above me. My arms and legs were restrained, my forehead marked with a cold red pen that tickled. 

I laughed, but my laughter exploded into hysterical sobs. 

Figures in blue scrubs surrounded me in a blur. 

They poked and prodded me, their voices collapsing into incomprehensible white noise. I slept for a while, dazed from the drugs feeding into my arms. 

I wasn't even aware of a cannula being forced into my wrist. The sound of a saw startled my numb thoughts, and I twisted my head, eyes flickering, lips trying to form words.

I remember everything was slow. 

Like I had been forced into slow motion. 

The back of my head had been shaved, and all of my hair was gone. 

The ice cold surface of the surgical table made me shiver. 

When the sound of the saw became unbearable, I gave up and forced myself to squint through a curtain of filthy plastic. 

There was a bed next to mine, pooling red seeping across the floor, a limp arm hanging over the edge. The hand was still moving, still clenching into a fist, like they could feel it, every cruel cut ripping them apart. I wondered who the boy was. 

I wondered what his life was like, and why he chose to end it.

*Why did you want to die, Ben?*

I squeezed my eyes shut as the saw continued. But morbid curiosity forced them open. I watched  numb, as blood pooled and ran black across the pristine white tiles, trickling through the gaps. 

There was so much of it. Ben, who never had a voice to scream with. 

Who had already been wiped away long before his brain was on sale. 

I could hear him being cut apart, and the sound drove me to the brink, teetering, and wanting to end it right there before a blade could slice into my skull. 

I tried to bite my tongue off. 

I tried to smash my head against the bed. 

But still, the saw grew louder, and I could sense it getting closer. 

Closer. 

Closer. 

When the boy’s hand finally went limp, I desperately tried to free myself from the table, but I was brutally restrained, my arms and legs tightly bound. 

The saw stopped, and a cleaner rushed in to deal with the blood. I could sense the figures in scrubs murmuring excitedly; they had exactly what they wanted, what my dad had bought him for. Vomit clung to my mouth, dripping down my chin. 

When I opened my eyes again, what was left of Ben was being wheeled away, leaving me alone in the cold, sterile room. 

For a brief moment, I found myself drowning in silence.

Silence.

It gave me hope.

Maybe Dad had a change of heart.

But then the screeching started up again.

Wait. The word didn’t make it to my lips. Instead, my body just froze, paralyzed.

“Miss Charlotte, can you count down to ten, please?”

The voice in my ear was a low murmur, a woman’s voice with a hint of empathy.

“One.” I whispered over the whirring blades growing closer.

“Two.”

“Three.”

“Four.”

I heaved in a breath, sobbing.

“Five.”

“Six.”

“Seven.”

The world went dark suddenly, and I panicked.

“Eight.”

The saw had stopped, and I was… falling. Just like Alice, down the rabbit hole. 

But this was deeper than a rabbit hole. 

I don't think this darkness had an ending, or a *bottom*. 

“Nine.” I whispered, my words felt wrong and void. 

*“Ten.”*

When I opened my eyes, the scene in front of me had shifted. I was no longer restrained, but lying comfortably on a soft bed. The sterile room was gone, replaced by the warm light of morning filtering through a window. My father was smiling at me. 

“Lily!” He hugged me, and I hugged him back.

“Sweetie, you look beautiful.”

I took my father’s hand. The bandages around my head felt itchy and uncomfortable, but I kept smiling as I walked into the morning sunlight that burned my face. I hadn’t felt the sun on my face in so long, it was perfect. 

When my father took me home, I entered the kitchen with the intention of finding a bone saw.

Just like the one used to kill me.

The sharpest thing I  could find was a butcher knife. I sliced up that bastard when he was curled up in bed. I started with his head, hacking it off when he was half awake, half conscious. He should have been fully awake, like you were, Lily. 

He should have been able to feel everything. 

I'm glad your Mom was out, because then I'd have to kill her too. 

I'm sorry I took your body, Lily. 

And for the record, I didn't *want* to die. 

I was kidnapped and sold overseas by my psycho university professor. 

Fucking asshole. 

I didn't jump off a bridge on Christmas Eve either. I spent that night hiding from him and his goons trying to hunt me down. I was PUSHED off the bridge. 

They faked my death and shipped me here. 

Apparently, some billionaire fuck wanted my brain for his daughter, but he pulled out of the deal, so I ended up in the bargain bin with all of the left behinds. 

It's the story they tell all of their customers so they feel better about murdering us. “Oh no, don't worry, this one *wanted* to die, so he's completely fine!”

Fuck. I'm sorry I took your body, Lily.

I'm sorry your Dad is a piece of shit. 

And I'm sorry I burned your house to the ground. 

You didn't answer me for a while. I think you're still in shock. 

Your voice is soothing, and it feels comfortable. Like we’re one. You're getting louder, and if I concentrate, it almost feels like I can feel your breath tickling my ear. 

*”It's okay, Ben!”* Your response almost feels like a goodbye. I hope it isn't.

1nh0a0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1nh0a0j/i_rushed_into_a_new_relationship/,I rushed into a new relationship,"So brief back story, 8 year relationship ended at the beginning of April this year, she broke up with me and moved out the next day, and it broke me. I mean, it absolutely destroyed me, I didn’t want to live, everything felt pointless.
Fast forward a few months and I bump into an old friend who was out walking her dog, and we got chatting. We had coffee, it was fun and refreshing, and things just kinda escalated. 

Fast forward to the last couple of weeks, and I can feel how into me she is, she’s affectionate, loving, caring, but I just didn’t feel the same. I wanted to, I really did, but my feelings just didn’t blossom the way hers did for me. 

So I sat her down and we talked, I explained how I was feeling, it wasn’t anything she did, it just wasn’t there for me. She asked if I was sure, and I explained how my ex told me every day that she loved me, that I was being paranoid and overthinking everything, even on the day she broke up with me, she told me it was all in my head, but hours later, she dumped me. She was a coward who put her own emotional comfort before my feelings.
I didn’t want to do that to this other girl, or to anyone. 

So here I am, feeling like garbage for breaking someone’s heart, even if I was up front and honest the whole time. She even thanked me for being honest, but I still feel like shit. 
I guess the lesson is don’t get into a relationship with someone unless you’re sure it’s got potential to go somewhere? I dunno, maybe I’m just destined to be single

Recovery isn’t fair. It’s not a math equation. It doesn’t give back what I put in and  it doesn’t reward effort on a timeline. I can do everything right and still get pulled under. It isnt about willpower or knowledge or effort...it's about surrender.

I’m trying to outsmart something that doesn’t care how smart I am. Addiction doesn’t negotiate. It doesn’t respond to therapy or care that I forgave my mom. It just sits there like a demon in the corner waiting for me to get tired and say, “fuck it"", and I get tired because I’m human.

So what now?

Lower the bar, way down. Aim for something so small it feels stupid. Don’t try to be “recovered.”. I’m exhausted trying to solve this but you can't solve addiction. You manage. That's it.

I need to get radically boring. Get up, clean something and get to meetings because I’m not meant to do this alone & I already hate my own head.

if I relapse again…Am I done then? Game over? That’s the real danger. Not the drug or urges. The danger is deciding I’m beyond saving. That’s the death sentence.

I don’t need another therapist. I need  someone who will show up, sit in the fire, hold the line with me and say, “You’re not dying so shut up and come have a coffee.”
that's not weakness. It's strategy.

I’m not broken. I’m in battle. Scraped, bruised, and burnt out—but still here. Until I'm not there’s still a fight to be had.",4,1757877734.0,alcoholicsanonymous,3,0.83,False

I was counting the usual glacial, indifferent stares of uninterested gawkers watching street musicians performing some flamenco in the park. Sitting next to them, I was enjoying the mild wind of September and thought, *""ah, that could be a cover of Gustavo Santaolalla,""* and closed my eyes for a bit to take a short nap after 8 hours straight of meetings. It was about two weeks ago.

Earlier, on an ugly morning before hitting Ritterstrasse, I wanted to sip a coffee at ""Rock, Paper..."" and I noticed a really beautiful girl sitting there, having just her own peaceful time, unbothered. She was casually smiling and speaking Italian or French to the waitress, and they were exchanging warm smiles that kind of improved my bad day. Shortly after, I accidentally had a random unspoken encounter when we both were at the counter ordering a drink. (no creepy thoughts, no xD).

So, fast forward to the park, she came to the same place as me and I was wondering: *""ah, but this is the same girl I saw earlier? Wtf, what are the chances in Berlin to meet the same stranger twice in the same day""* And I thought that was awesome, just by that fact. Her presence was comforting even without the slightest interaction, and she was just there painting the tree in front of Böcklerpark.

When she left, she respectfully and smiley nodded to say goodbye to me, and she actually turned her head specifically to say goodbye to me... Like, she could have done that with many other people sitting just next to me, and me, like a fcktard, I wasn’t able to come up with even the slightest freaking phoneme. Like I could have said, *""I noticed you were painting. It was really beautiful...""* but no. I badly wanted to get to know her better.

I have studied several languages to different levels but French is the main one and where things feel unusual and frustrating and I’d love to reach a more advanced level.

I took French all of high school, and did one semester in college where I was able to test into an intermediate class. In the years since I have revisited it here and there, to keep up with the grammar and vocabulary, but I could never ever speak. I got by in school, but I could never apply it outside of the classroom. I even had an opportunity to go to France a couple of times, and at most could order a coffee or wine, but that’s it.

I revisited French more seriously again in the past year, because I started graduate school. I decided to do my French reading/translation exam early on to get it out of the way, and I passed. For the past year I have practiced vocabulary and even my phone is in French. Recently I tried speaking practice and I could barely remember how to say where I’m from. I feel absolutely ridiculous. And I know there is a mental barrier that is brutally restricting me.

But I’d love to know if anyone else has experience speaking and reading at vastly different levels, and what it took you break the mental wall.

One last anecdote: a couple of years ago I started to learn spanish. With guidance from threads here I did dreaming spanish and investigated comprehensible input. When I saw a tutor my confidence felt better after several months of Spanish studying than literal years of French studying. I wonder if I tried studying french again from that approach, if I would see a difference. Maybe I’m answering my own Q but I’m sick of feeling alone in this.

1nh07fi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanSweepers/comments/1nh07fi/reveal_why_songmics_trash_bags_are_a_surprising/,Reveal Why SONGMICS Trash Bags Are a Surprising Kitchen Essential,"Testing the SONGMICS UKRB30A02 trash bags for my daily kitchen and household chores turned out to be a surprisingly smooth experience. These drawstring garbage bags caught my attention mainly for their claim to be heavy-duty and pre-separated for convenience. With a busy household that somehow churns out a constant stream of trash, I’m always on the hunt for sturdy and reliable trash bags. I tried them out over a few weeks to see how they stood up to their promises, and there's plenty to say about their performance.

**Built for Strength and Durability**  
One of the most impressive qualities of this product is that the bags are made from a 0.8 mil thick polyethylene material. At first glance, I doubted whether they’d handle the overflow of our kitchen waste, but during testing, they managed to hold up to 44 pounds of trash without tearing or puncturing. I’ve dealt with flimsy trash bags in the past, and those experiences always ended with spills or leaks that added to the mess. These garbage bags resisted tears even under the strain of leftovers, glass jars, and occasional coffee grounds—a major win for me. Needless to say, their promise to prevent leaks and punctures holds true in most scenarios I encountered.

**Beyond Kitchen Use**  
Finding a product that goes beyond its typical purpose is always a good thing. These bags surprised me with their versatility. I found them extremely handy while packing up old clothes for donations and clearing up leaves when managing my garden. They held all kinds of sharp-edged, oddly shaped, and heavy items without creating stress that they might rip or burst open. As much as this may sound trivial, having one reliable item for so many chores adds to their appeal.  

[Want SONGMICS UKRB30A02? Discover the price on Amazon.](https://app.womanreview.com/p/b083tzw748/)

**Convenience of Pre-Separated Bags**  
What sets these apart from other garbage bags is how easy they are to grab and go. Since each bag is pre-separated, I didn’t have to wrestle with rolls of fused-together bags. This may sound like a small feature, but trust me, early mornings and late-night clean-ups become marginally better when you can pull one bag without worrying about tearing the next one on the roll. It’s a level of convenience that keeps things efficient.  

**Drawstring That Delivers**  
The drawstring feature was another highlight for me. Both sides of the bag come with reinforced drawstrings that hold tightly to the rim of my trash can. This prevents the bag from slipping down as it gets heavier, which has been a recurring annoyance with other bags I’ve used. What I loved most was how the drawstring sealed the bag neatly once it was full, securely locking in all odors. Let’s just say my nose appreciated this feature more than I expected during summer garbage runs. The tight seal makes the kitchen or alley smell like anything but trash, which is a challenge every homeowner can relate to.

**Perfect Sizing for Compatibility**  
The product is optimized to fit an 8-gallon trash can perfectly. With dimensions of 19.9 inches by 29.1 inches, it hugs the bin rim perfectly while leaving no slack. Although the product claims it’s designed to match SONGMICS-branded trash cans, I tested them with an unspectacular bin from another brand, and they worked just as well. Knowing they’re adaptable to other 8-gallon trash bins is a bonus, especially if you already have an existing setup and aren’t ready to buy additional branded accessories.

**Highlights**  
- Strong and durable material resists leaks, punctures, and tears.  
- Pre-separated bags save time and hassle.  
- Versatile enough for everyday garbage, gardening tasks, and packing purposes.  
- Drawstring securely seals odor and grips the bin.  
- Tailored for 8-gallon trash cans but compatible with other similar sizes.

**Areas for Improvement**  
While it does excel in many aspects, no product is without fault. These bags did have some minor drawbacks here and there that stood out during my usability testing.  
- I noticed that the 44-pound limit may just be an ideal maximum because overly sharp or heavy items such as broken porcelain did manage to stress-test the material.  
- They’re slightly more expensive compared to generic trash bags, but that’s a common issue with any branded product possessing specific features.  
- Occasionally, I’d have to adjust the drawstring when dealing with irregular or extra-loose trash can rims.

**Competing Products**  
For those considering alternatives, there are a few other notable trash bag brands on the market. Simplehuman offers a similar custom-fit garbage bag for their branded cans, but they tend to be pricier without delivering significantly different results in functionality. Glad-branded bags also have strength and odor-locking technologies, though they lack pre-separated rolls, which SONGMICS easily outshines in terms of convenience. On a durability front, SONGMICS holds its own remarkably well compared to these industry competitors. At a similar pricing point, it’s hard to beat the range of features you get with this product.

**Value for Money**  
Looking at its cost in the context of functionality and special attributes, these garbage bags are worth every penny. Yes, the lack of a rock-bottom price might make you pause if you compare them to no-name alternatives. However, their sheer durability, convenience, and odor-locking mechanism really justify the investment. Whether you’re proactively managing a household or tackling hefty disposal tasks, these bags truly deliver in reliability and value.

1nh023n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reduction/comments/1nh023n/heres_what_worked_for_me/,Here’s what worked for me,"A few months ago, I (26NB) posted here about getting rejected by my insurance. Incredibly, it got overturned, and I had my surgery on August 21st. My surgeon was Lawrence Iteld in Chicago, IL, and I could not recommend him more highly. He and his whole team were so accommodating and helpful. 

I told him that I wanted to be as small as possible without FNG. My breasts we’re very saggy from significant weight loss about 8 years ago. I had G cups before weight loss and DD cups after. Now I think I’m sitting around a full B. It feels incredible. 

I went back for my 3-week post-op, and he cleared me to work out again. (So much sympathy for those of us who have not had as easy of a recovery. I feel very blessed that my body handled this the way it did, and I think a lot of my prep really helped.) Here’s what worked for me:

I got my surgery date around 5 weeks out. As soon as I got my date, I locked in on nutrition and exercise. I went to the gym at least 3 times a week, got in 10-15k steps, and prioritized fiber and protein (+a daily multivitamin). I especially focused on building up strength in my shoulders and chest.  A few days before, my partner went shopping for easy breakfasts, protein shakes (that I mixed with my coffees), and maybe most importantly, pineapple. For two or three days before surgery, I drank pineapple juice and ate cans of pineapple. This was something I heard from DI top surgery forums, and it really helped. It helps with swelling and bloating. It’s also a natural diuretic, so it helps your bowel movements post-op. I continued with the same nutrition and multivitamin post-op and prioritized a 20-30 minute walk every day. I also started stretching the night of surgery. I lifted my arms to shoulder height as soon as I could, and my range of motion progressed naturally. 

Also breathing. I was told to take 10 deep breaths per hour, not in a row. Filling lungs until you can feel the sensation of your belly filling up with air. 

I slept on the couch with a pregnancy pillow and a pillow under my shoulders and knees. I am NOT a back sleeper and this arrangement helped a lot. 

Dr. Iteld uses a non-narcotic approach. He numbs the whole chest area, and all my pain management was done with extra strength tylenol. The numbing meds that he used were supposed to last for 48 hours. My body metabolized it much faster. The pain really put me on my ass for a few days, but I’m so glad I didn’t use narcotics. I was awake and alert, so my partner was able to go back to work sooner. 

I started wearing scar tapes a week after, and I also use aquaphor after showers and before bed. 

Today, I worked out for the first time, and it was incredible. I feel so much lighter and so much more capable. I can move easier. I can jog easier. Hoping for good recoveries for everyone else.

Been there, done that. 😅

That’s exactly why I had to tell you about the \*\*\*\*. This sleek little gadget has completely flipped my at-home mani game. It’s **cordless, fast, and ridiculously pro-level**, and honestly? It makes me feel like I’m running my own mini nail salon from my kitchen table.

So, let’s chat about what makes this thing so magical — and whether it’s worth the splurge.

# Why a Cordless UV Nail Lamp Is a Total Life Upgrade

Ever tangled yourself in cords mid-manicure? Same. That’s why the “cordless” part is a *big deal*.

Here’s what makes a **cordless UV/LED nail lamp** so dang convenient:

* **Portability:** No outlet-hunting. Do your nails on the couch, bed, or even outside if you’re feeling fancy.
* **Less clutter:** No cord spaghetti on your desk. 🙌
* **Pro vibes:** It just *feels* salon-grade when you can move it anywhere.

And when you combine **cordless design** with **UV + LED curing power**, you get the best of both worlds — fast curing and flexibility.

**FYI:** The V Beauty Pure model has **up to 10 hours of battery life**, so you can host an entire mani party without it dying on you.

# Key Features That Make It Stand Out

Okay, let’s get nerdy (but like… fun nerdy). This isn’t just another cute gadget — it’s packed with legit **professional nail lamp features**:

* **36W power with 20 LED bulbs** — gives you **fast curing** even for stubborn gel colors.
* **5-second flash cure + 30s/60s timers** — perfect for base layers or full sets.
* **Low-heat mode** — saves your sensitive nails from the “oh no it’s burning” moment.
* **Auto sensor (on/off)** — just slide your hand in, and it powers on like magic.
* **Wide opening + removable base** — fits **both manicures and pedicures** easily.
* **Acetone-resistant exterior** — because accidents *will* happen.
* **Lightweight at just 2.2 lbs** — super easy to carry for travel or mobile work.
* **Universal 120/240V** — so yes, you can even take it on international trips. 🌍

And let’s not forget — it’s **white, sleek, and minimal**, so it actually looks pretty sitting on your desk.

# My Honest Experience (and Mild Obsession)

So here’s the deal: I bought this lamp after my old plug-in one *literally sparked* while curing a top coat (zero stars, do not recommend).

The **first thing I noticed**? How **fast** it cured my gel polish. I’m talking **under 30 seconds per layer** — no weird bubbling, no tackiness left behind.

Also, the **cordless design is life-changing.** I now paint my nails at the coffee table while watching Netflix, which makes me feel like I’ve cracked some kind of secret life hack.

Would I call it a splurge? Yeah. Would I buy it again in a heartbeat? **Absolutely.** IMO, it’s worth every penny just for the **pro-level performance** and **freedom to move it anywhere**.

[See the current deal on Amazon](https://amzn.to/46yaAXv) *($269.99 or $19.63/mo for 18 months)*

# How It Compares to Other Nail Lamps

You might be wondering: is this really better than the $40 lamp you saw on TikTok? Short answer: yes, and here’s why.

# Budget Lamps

* Usually **plug-in only**
* Often **weak curing power** (leads to peeling gel polish)
* **Small opening** (awkward for pedicures)
* **No flash cure mode**

# 

* **Cordless + rechargeable** (10 hr battery life)
* **36W with 20 LEDs** = powerful, even cure
* **Low-heat + flash cure modes**
* **Spacious opening & removable base**
* **Salon-grade build quality**

Basically, it’s like comparing a tricycle to a Tesla. Both roll, but only one makes you feel fabulous. 😉

# Who It’s Perfect For

This lamp isn’t just for pros (though nail techs love it). It’s awesome if you:

* Do **regular gel manicures or pedicures at home**
* Want a **reliable, long-lasting curing lamp**
* Travel often and need a **portable nail lamp**
* Run a **mobile nail business** and need **pro gear without bulky cords**
* Are tired of **slow curing and half-dried polish** 😬

Basically, if you want salon results without leaving your couch, this one’s for you.

# Tips for Getting the Best Results

Even the best nail lamp won’t save a sloppy manicure. 😅 Here’s how to get flawless results:

* **Apply thin layers** of gel polish — thick layers cure unevenly.
* **Use the flash cure (5s) mode** for base coats to lock them in quickly.
* **Clean the bulbs regularly** — dust can block the light.
* **Charge it fully** before long sessions to keep curing power strong.
* **Store it safely** — it’s acetone-resistant, but not gravity-proof. 😅

Do this, and your nails will look like you just walked out of a salon.

# Is It Worth the Price Tag?

Let’s be honest: **$269.99 isn’t cheap.** You could buy like… a small wardrobe at Target for that.

But here’s the thing — this lamp **actually saves money** over time.

Salon gel manicures can run $40–$60 each. If you do your nails just **five or six times**, this lamp has already paid for itself. Plus, you don’t have to book appointments or leave your house (and pants are optional at home, just saying 😏).

So yeah, it’s an investment — but a smart one if you’re serious about your nails.

But, I now live at the far south end of Austin, and that is a bit too much of a drive. I'm sitting at The Hive, on South Menchaca right now. It's great, and relatively close to home.

I know. I'm being super picky here.

I've been to LOTS of coffee shops. So far, none quite fits the bill. 

Quackenbush (Captain Quack's) on Menchaca: Close, but limited seating in actual coffee shop. Most of the seating is in the special event area.

It will be an interactive role-playing type of experience for guests like the former “Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser” that operated from March 2022 to September 2023. 

However, it will have several changes from the original concept including, a fixed 7-day and 7-night stay from a Saturday to a following Saturday, And there was plenty of opportunities for guests to just relax and enjoy the hotel the way they want to.

The hotel complex itself will be called “Seymour’s Bay Grandeur Resort”. 

  
I’m gonna upload these in several posts so you can all be hyped each time.

  
Down below is the rundown of what Day One would look like…

  
All guests arrive at the gate that surrounds the elaborately themed building for the ""Seymour's Bay Grandeur Resort"" hotel. After confirming their identities at the gate, guests to the lobby drop off area, and after checking into the hotel, either at the kiosk or with a nearby cast member, they get a special ""Bob's Burgers""-themed MagicBand that can be used as the hotel room key, as well as be used to charge stuff to the room, and it comes with preloaded ""Lighting Lane"" passes for the rides in the theme park.  
  
Inside, yes, go to widen area and they sit down in long rows of chairs like in an airport or cruise ship terminal. It is a nice air condition lobby and they provide complementary bottles of water, and some snacks. After arriving at around 9:00am, at around 10:00am, all of the guests are directed into a large room that has a preshow screen at the very front.   
  
Then watch preshow safety video talk about the upcoming hotel experience they're about to have a fixed one-week say, but goes over important rules, such as want to do in case of a fire, the difference between a show notification announcement and an actual emergency alarm, what not to do with the actors, and what happens if you break the rules. The video is over, guests are directed to a row of elevators that look really fancy. Each of the Elevators can hold up to 100 people, and after everyone is inside, they are sent up to the second floor of the building.  
  
Once on the second floor of the building, the elevator doors open up, and they are revealed to have made it to the hotel lobby. The Lobby is massive and luxurious, and is part of the atrium. The lobby has long sofas and seats to sit down on, The entrance to the gift shop, the entrance to the spa, four public restroom facilities, a first aid clinic entrance, and the hallways that connect all the other rooms to the atrium. There is also a balcony at the very front and sides of the wall on an upper level that is for employees only, where shows will occur.  
  
Guests use this time to go to their rooms, unpack, and settle in. Each has all the standard amenities such as queen size or king size beds, bunk beds in some rooms, single person beds in some rooms, a coffee machine, a flat screen TV with free ""Disney+"" access, a mini fridge full of free snacks and drinks, a restroom, and a closet. They also have free Internet access.  
  
After settling in, guests are able to go to the buffet for lunch that starts after 11:00am, and they enjoy variety of dishes around the United States and some from around the world. They also get to enjoy a creative burger of the day that was featured in real episodes of the show.

After Lunch, at 1:00pm, all the guests are called to the lobby to get ready for the opening ceremony of the hotel. Once everyone gathers into the lobby, the show begins when the actor appears on the balcony after walking out of door and walk to the guest to the upcoming grand opening of the new hotel in Seymour Bay. The guest is gonna be the best of their lives and that they're gonna have so much fun and enjoy the amazing amenities the hotel has to offer.  
  
He then begins to start the countdown from 10 so they can cut the ribbon that is displayed on the railing, but suddenly, the door opens and an actor playing Sargent Bosco walk out and demand the ceremony be stopped. The manager wants to know what is going on uniform Officer actors walk up onto the balcony.   
  
Bosco says that they received several anonymous reports that possible murderer and thief has entered the vicinity of the hotel and then until they are found, the hotel is under investigation. The manager tries to deny anything like that, but Bosco says not to interfere or he'll be arrested. The manager tries to explain a big deal. Bosco says the grand opening, but they're just gonna be investigating during the time. The manager then sheepishly offers Bosco and his police officers a whole block of rooms on the second floor, to make it easier to come in and out during this investigation, and Bosco happily agrees, and they all proceed to leave.  
  
The manager assures the guests not to worry, and hopefully no one is going to get in trouble, and that the ceremony will still go on. They then proceeded to do the countdown again and after the ribbon is cut, everyone cheers and confetti is shot into the air. He didn't tell everyone to have a great rest of the day and they are all dismissed..  
  
The guests are able to enjoy the other parts of the hotel, and the many amenities or just relax in their rooms. At 5:00pm to 8:00pm, an amazing dinner buffet is set up for guests. As they eat, an actor playing Calvin Fischoeder arrives and announces that he wants to welcome the hotel personally into the town by performing his own song and then he stands at the grand piano and performance one of the songs from the show.  
  
After dinner ends, everyone is allowed to wind down and go back to the room and that is the end of day one",0,1757876709.0,BobsBurgers,0,0.33,False
1ngzt8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEarReviews/comments/1ngzt8n/uncover_is_the_best_water_boiler_zojirushi/,Uncover Is the Best Water Boiler Zojirushi CD-LFC50 Worth It,"Trying out the Zojirushi CD-LFC50 for the past couple of weeks has been a game-changer in my kitchen. As someone who spends a lot of time crafting specialty tea blends and other hot beverages, a high-quality water boiler and warmer isn't just a luxury—it's a necessity. At first glance, its polished white finish and ergonomic design caught my eye, but it’s the functionality that truly stands out. Once you use this powerhouse, it's hard to go back to anything less sophisticated.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was how compact yet sturdy this unit feels. Despite having a 5-liter capacity, the Zojirushi CD-LFC50 isn’t overwhelmingly large. With dimensions of approximately 11.88 by 9.13 by 13.13 inches, it fits snugly on my countertop without monopolizing the space. The Panorama Window water level gauge is a brilliant addition. It’s effortless to check the water level at a glance, and the visibility it offers keeps me from refilling at the most inconvenient moments. The nonstick interior makes cleaning it a breeze. I was initially wary of products requiring hand washing, but thanks to its design, even that part was a non-issue.

**Pluses**  
- The intuitive micro computerized temperature control makes setting the perfect water temperature incredibly easy.  
- With four temperature settings—160°F, 175°F, 195°F, and 208°F—this product caters to multiple uses, such as brewing green tea, making French press coffee, or even preparing instant noodles.  
- The Quick Temp mode bypasses boiling altogether, heating water directly up to 160°F, 175°F, or 195°F. This is a godsend on mornings when I’m rushing out the door.  
- The energy-saving timer (6–10 hours) has proved invaluable. It keeps my energy bills manageable, and it’s nice waking up to perfectly heated water.  

**Performance in Everyday Use**  
Honestly, having this water boiler has streamlined so much of my daily routine. It holds heat exceptionally well and never required re-heating during the day, even during marathon tea-brewing sessions. The dispensing function deserves special credit. The ""Cafe Drip"" mode meant for slower dispensing has prevented many messy disasters, especially when I'm half-asleep and pouring water into a tiny teacup. I have to mention the swivel base here—it’s thoughtfully designed and makes serving from any angle incredibly convenient.

[See Zojirushi CD-LFC50 deals on Amazon now.](https://sohdu.com/p/b0166od6j0/)

**Caveats**  
- One issue I’ve observed is that the cord isn’t super long. While the detachable cord is practical for storage, it has limited how far I can place the unit from a power outlet.  
- Another minor quibble is the unit’s weight. At six pounds empty, moving it around the kitchen for cleaning or rearranging can feel cumbersome once filled with water.  
- While the timer functionality is great, it takes a bit of fiddling to get accustomed to the settings. A beginner might feel a tad overwhelmed initially.  

**Peer Products**  
Comparing the Zojirushi CD-LFC50 with others like the Panasonic NC-EH30PC and the Tiger PDU-A40U-K, there are clear distinctions. Panasonic’s model is slightly more compact and lighter, which could appeal to those with smaller kitchens. However, it loses out on advanced features like the Zojirushi’s Quick Temp mode. The Tiger model, on the other hand, offers digital presets but lacks the swivel base convenience that I’ve grown to appreciate with the CD-LFC50. Between these options, none provided the same blend of reliability, energy-saving features, and ease of handling.

**Bang for the Buck**  
It’s tricky to discuss the price without getting into specifics, but the Zojirushi water boiler feels like solid value for serious tea and coffee drinkers or homes where hot water is a daily essential. Sure, you could opt for a cheaper electric kettle, but you’d be sacrificing features like timer settings, temperature precision, and the convenience of larger capacity. All these advantages make this unit feel worth every penny spent.

I adore the way your laughter folds into the silence,  
The way your eyes speak in languages only my heart understands.  
You are my calm, my chaos, my favorite kind of beautiful.

I want to trace the map of your moods,  
Learn the rhythm of your sighs,  
And hold you like a secret the universe whispered just to me.

There’s something deliciously innocent  
In the way you make me blush with a glance,  
And something wildly magnetic  
In the way your presence pulls me closer—  
Not just physically, but soulfully.

Let me be the reason you smile at your phone.  
Let me be the warmth in your pillow,  
The daydream in your coffee,  
The kiss that lingers on your skin  
Long after I’ve said goodnight.

You are not just beauty —you are sacred.  
Not just cute—you are captivating.  
And loving you feels like poetry that never ends.

So here I am,

Soul wide open,  
Ready to love you in ways

About 3 weeks ago I purchased a cleaning kit for my virtuo next that came with a plastic pod with a barcode on the bottom that was to be used to clean the machine. (It came with some tablets that are placed in the pod and clean the machine as it ran.) When I ran the cleaning cycle it stopped abruptly in the middle and my Nespresso app returned a code that said I was trying to use an unsupported pod. 

Since that happened, I have run a descaling routine (twice) and cleaning routine (twice) with no problems, but each time I put in a pod to make a coffee I get the same message on the app, that I am trying to use an unsupported pod.

I have:
Restarted the machine
Descaled the machine
Cleaned the machine inside and out with water and dish soap
Cleaned the barcode reader with q-tips 
Cleaned the upper spinning head
Reset to factory settings
Tried unsuccessfully to make coffee using three different types/sizes of coffee

When all of a sudden, I hear a guy hurling slurs and insults, repeatedly saying ""F****T"". He was insulting these two gentlemen who were holding hands. 

One of the guys was ready to throw hands with this moron, but his boyfriend was holding him back, and just told him to ""f*ck off!"". When the couple walked past me, I asked them, ""Are you guys okay?"" One of them said that he's not bothered by it, as if that was just a normal occurence. And of them smiled at me. They both just continued walking, still holding hands, unbothered by the derogatory remarks that still went on in the background.

I'm still a bit shaken now, because I felt like I was personally assaulted, too. I'm a gay man myself. I'm also just heartbroken that these petty things still happen in 2025, especially here in Toronto. But I'm glad about the solidarity that people showed amidst the hatred. The people walking with the couple gave the idiotic homophobe the middle finger, and they were making a protective circle around the couple. I left the scene because I felt unsafe, too. I talked to an elderly gentleman who was there. He told me, ""I don't get it. You're just minding your own business, and then you get assaulted."" I replied to him, ""I don't get the hate, either.""

If you're bothered by same-sex couples just living their best lives, the problem is on you. Don't wag insults like, ""is he your f*ck buddy, huh?"", when we all know that you're not getting any action and spice in the bedroom. Why all the hate? Why all the violence? These two beautiful people displaying their love for each other clearly reflect how ugly, insecure, tiny, and insignificant of a human being you are.

Honestly, I get tired of saying, ""let's be kind to one another, please"", because I feel like kindness has become very scarce these days. But, I would always stand by my queer brothers and sisters.

PLEASE, people!!! For the love of all the gods and goddesses up in the high heavens, let's all just spread love and kindness, okay??? It wouldn't cost you a single dollar to be kind. 🏳️‍🌈

When we first got together, I noticed he spent a lot of time with his friends which didn’t bother me until we started hanging out less while he started hanging out with his friends more. It was to the point where we hadn’t seen each other for a whole month. He would always have an excuse. “I don’t have a ride” is the one he used the most. Which was weird because he ALWAYS had a ride to his friend’s house. 

Fast forward to recent issues. We obviously are in school and there’s a strict bathroom policy. We cannot be out for more than 10 minutes or you get marked absent and they call your parents. 7th hour is the hour we usually meet at to talk, hug and give a few kisses. We aren’t a PDA type of couple so this is the only time we can do these things with no one around. 

Anywho, we text each other that we are coming out. When I come out, I notice he is talking to his friend. Again I didn’t mind. He see’s me and I see him. I stood at the end of the hall and waited for him to get done talking to him. I got impatient and ending up going to the coffee shop to get some chips and a cookie. I come back to the hallway and I still see him talking to his friend. By this time I had already been out about 7 minutes. I stood there for a minute and he see’s me but again he still is talking to his friend. At this point I’m pissed and I head back to class. On my way there, I text him I am going back. When I get to my class, he texts two minutes later and asks where I’m at. I tell him I am in class and that his friend was more important. He starts to apologize over and over. I forgive him and that was that. 

Before we get on the bus (our busses are on two different sides of the school). We talk, say our goodbyes and hug. This time he was around a group of his friends. Instead of leaving them to give me a hug, he doesn’t say anything to me and continues talking to his friends. Again I’m pissed so I walk away and head outside explaining to my friends what has been going on. When I get home, he apologizes to me again. Over and over and over until I forgive him. 

Then we get to this weekend. I ask him if we could fall asleep on the phone. He tells me not tonight but doesn’t give me a reason why. I felt upset about it and continued our conversation like normal. Until he tells me about a joke his friends made about him. He never tells me about his friends unless they are with him. I get even more upset that he didn’t tell me his friends were over and I start to leave him on open. Occasionally he would ask why I’m leaving him on open but I wouldn’t respond. This went on for about 3 hours until I was ready to go to bed. I text him goodnight and he doesn’t text me for about 3 hours so I delete the message before finally going to sleep. To me it seems his friends are more important than me. AITAH?",3,1757876463.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

1ngzp0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/1ngzp0a/free_will_and_determinism_are_meaningless/,Free will and determinism are meaningless,"The debate over free will and determinism is one of the oldest in the history of philosophy. Some see the human being as an autonomous subject, capable of choosing “freely,” while others see them as the result of an inevitable chain of causes and effects, where choice is an illusion. But perhaps both perspectives are meaningless, because both assume that there is something beyond the process itself—some “self” that either governs or is governed. And when we look closely, we see only processes unfolding according to their causes.

Everything we call “self” or “decision” is the result of the interweaving of biological, psychological, and social factors. There is no sharp boundary where causes end and “free will” begins. The thought that we want coffee rather than tea is as much a product of chemical states in the brain and cultural associations as the falling of an apple is a product of gravity.

Determinism, for its part, also turns out to be an empty word. To say that everything is determined is simply to acknowledge that events have causes. But what else could they have? Even if we allow for randomness or quantum indeterminacy, they still appear as processes unfolding according to their own logic.

Instead of debating whether we are “free” or “predetermined,” we might view the human being as a knot in a vast network of processes—biological, social, cultural, historical. We are neither “authors” nor “puppets”—we are the very unfolding of these processes.

This perspective is not merely abstract. It can also bring liberation: if there is no autonomous “self” that “must” control everything, then guilt, condemnation, and self-reproach lose their weight. What remains is the understanding that every act is simply an expression of a complex dynamic of causes.",2,1757876438.0,freewill,15,1.0,False

1ngzoxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1ngzoxx/issues_ordering_drip_coffee/,Issues ordering drip coffee.,"Hi Guys,

I frequent Starbucks a couple times a month. I typically like to go into the store to order rather than use the drive thru. I have the same order every time - Hot venti coffee with a splash of 2% milk.

Now here's the problem. About half of the time I have to wait 5+ minutes after ordering to receive my coffee, there have been a few times it's been 10+ minutes. It seems like it's the cashier's responsibility to make my order and they seem over worked and often forget about it while ringing other people up. Usually the only thing that gets the ball going is when someone sees me waiting around and asks ""What are you waiting for?"" I see many cars go through the drive through while I wait.

While I admit I am not the most patient person it just seems like my order falls through the cracks way too often. It used to be much better before they brewed each cup individually rather than make pots of coffee, although I will admit the coffee consistency is now much better.

It just seems like this is some kind of systemic failure as I go to many different locations and have the same issue. Maybe they just don't get someone ordering regular coffee that often so it throws them off? Not sure but it's becoming quite annoying.",0,1757876434.0,starbucks,3,0.5,False
1ngznnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1ngznnn/limerence_turning_to_something_else/,Limerence turning to something else....,"Been posting on here recently about my limerent experience, my marriage has been on the rocks and the limerence seems to have started because of the lack of connection in my life.  I've been tussling with the LE for a few months, and it has been painful.  However something has happened that has turned things upside down, in a good way I think.

FYI my marriage was pretty cooked by the time this started and I have told my wife that I wish to officially seperate- this is because of my multiple bids to repair being ignored and the constant low level abuse NOT because of my LE- I've done a lot of soul searching over this to make sure it's the right reasons.

Was chatting to LO last week and she asked how I was, I told her that things were tough as I was in the process of splitting from my wife, we hadn't really talked overly personal stuff before and she confided that her marriage was pretty miserable and her husband was a very traumatised guy that takes it out on her and her kids, and isn't really responding well to couples counselling.  We ended up going for coffee and we've since confessed some strong feelings for each other, seems she's limerent about me too.  The vibe is really strong.

We're keeping things chaste due to the being married situation but we're set on getting to know each other some more why we navigate our failing marriages.

I appreciate that this will seem pretty unsavoury to many, all I will say is that we both want to navigate this ethically.  And also don't judge unless you've been trapped in an abusive relationship for years and you met someone who actually sees you as a good person and makes you FEEL something good for a change.

We've talked about the risk of this being a flash in the pan, but we're both pretty aware people who want to get this right and we do seem very compatible at the moment.",4,1757876354.0,limerence,2,1.0,False

1ngzm6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ngzm6d/comparing_3_studies_on_multibagger_stocks/,Comparing 3 Studies on Multibagger Stocks,"Decided to compare research from three studies about stocks that return 10-100x+ your money and share my findings here.

Here's what I read through:

* Christopher Mayer: ""100 Baggers"" (2015); Covered 1962-2014.
* Jenga Investment Partners (Dede Eyesan): ""Global Outperformers"" (2023); Covered 2012-2022.
* Anna Yartseva: ""The Alchemy of Multibagger Stocks"" (2025); Covered 2009-2024.

Clearly, these aren't apples-to-apples comparisons. Besides the time period differences, Mayer looked at 100-baggers using case studies. Jenga performed academic research on 446 global 10-baggers (not just US stocks), and Yartseva used statistical models on 464 NYSE and NASDAQ-traded stocks. These studies may suffer from survivorship bias as well.

Regardless, I think it's an interesting comparison to potentially understand recurring themes/patterns and identify any surprising findings.

# What Doesn't Matter

**Earnings Growth**

One of the most surprising findings was on earnings growth and how many investors/books say it's essential, including Mayer.

However, Yartseva's statistical analysis found that earnings growth was NOT a significant predictor of multibagger returns.

Specifically, she tested EPS growth, EBITDA growth, gross profit growth, operating profit (EBIT) growth, and net profit growth over both 1-year and 5-year periods. None were statistically significant in her dynamic panel regression models.

Interestingly, while Yartseva found earnings growth wasn't predictive, her winners still achieved impressive growth rates: 17.3% CAGR in operating profit, 22.9% in net profit, and 20.0% in EPS.

Eyesan found the average profitable company grew operating earnings at 20% CAGR.

**Industry**

Yartseva's 464 multibaggers came from several sectors, not just tech:

Information Technology (20%), Industrials (19%), Consumer Discretionary (18%), Healthcare (14%), and even traditionally slow-growth sectors like Utilities (1%).

Eyesan found similar sector diversity among his 446 global outperformers: Information Technology led with 25.8%, followed by Industrials (15.2%), Healthcare (14.1%), Materials (13.5%), and Consumer Discretionary (10.5%).

Notably, Information Technology, Healthcare, and Materials outperformed relative to their market representation. Tech represented 25.8% of winners but only 12.7% of the overall market. Semiconductors alone jumped from 1 outperformer in 2002-2012 to 44 in 2012-2022.

This broad distribution suggests screening by sector would eliminate many opportunities.

**Other Factors**

Yartseva's research also found several widely-tracked metrics showed no predictive power:

* Dividend policies (58% of multibaggers paid dividends at start, 78% by end - no correlation).
* Debt levels (debt-to-equity and debt-to-capital ratios didn't predict returns).
* Share buybacks (no statistical significance).
* Analyst coverage (being followed or ignored didn't matter).
* Altman Z-scores for bankruptcy risk (failed statistical tests).
* R&D spending relative to free cash flow (surprisingly no correlation with becoming a multibagger).

# What Actually Matters

**Company Size**

Every single study found that smaller companies outperform:

* Mayer: Median $500M market cap, with median sales of $170M.
* Eyesan: Found 63% of winners were nano-caps (<$50M market cap) in 2012, with only 7/446 winners (1.6%) being large caps.
* Yartseva: $348M median market cap in 2009, with median revenue of $702M. Notably, Yartseva found that small-cap stocks generated average excess returns of 37.7% annually, compared to 14.5% for mid-caps and 9.7% for large-caps.

This makes logical sense given it's easier to grow from a small base - a $100M company doubling is much easier than a $100B company doubling.

**Moats**

All three studies agreed on competitive advantages/moats. Companies need something protecting their profits from competition:

* Mayer: Emphasized economic moats as essential for durability. ""A 100-bagger requires a high return on capital for a long time. A moat, by definition, is what allows a company to get that return.""
* Eyesan: Found that outperformers typically had or developed competitive advantages.
* Yartseva: While acknowledging competitive advantages were important based on prior literature, she didn't isolate this as a specific variable in her models, instead incorporating it into overall business quality metrics.

**Patience**

They also agreed on patience:

* Mayer: 100-baggers took 26 years on average. Also emphasized the ""coffee-can"" portfolio philosophy.
* Eyesan: All 446 global outperformers achieved their 10-bagger status within 10 years (2012-2022 study period).
* Yartseva: 10-baggers ranged from 7.5 to 40.5 years, with her 464 stocks averaging 26-fold returns (21.4% CAGR) over 15 years.

**Revenue Growth**

Revenue growth was discussed across all studies:

* Mayer: Emphasized the need for significant growth but didn't specify a minimum rate.
* Eyesan: Found 15% CAGR average revenue growth in his winners.
* Yartseva: Found 11.1% CAGR median revenue growth in her winners.

**FCF Yield & Book Value**

Yartseva's statistical model confirmed free cash flow (FCF) to price ratio as the most important driver of multibagger stock outperformance.

In her regression models, FCF/P showed coefficients ranging from 46 to 82, while book-to-market (B/M) showed coefficients from 7 to 42. Together, a 1% increase in FCF/P and B/M ratios was associated with 7-52% higher annual returns.

FCF/P captures both the company's cash generation and what you're paying for it.

B/M ratios above 0.40 combined with positive operating profitability showed higher chances of positive returns in Yartseva's portfolio sorts.

However, Yartseva warns to avoid companies with negative equity (where liabilities exceed assets). Small-cap companies w/negative equity declined 18.1% annually, medium-caps fell 9.4%, and large-caps dropped 7.6%.

**Other Valuation Metrics**

Yartseva's winners started with median valuations of P/S 0.6, P/B 1.1, forward P/E 11.3, and PEG 0.8, all suggesting they were undervalued at the start.

Eyesan found that 48.9% of outperformers started trading below 10x EV/EBIT and 50.7% below 1x EV/Revenue, suggesting most winners begin at low valuations rather than high growth premiums.

Yartseva found EV/Revenue and EV/EBITDA were significant in some model specifications but lost significance in her more robust models, suggesting they matter but aren't as reliable as FCF/P.

**Profitability Threshold**

Profitability metrics appeared in all three studies but with different focuses:

* Mayer: Preferred 20%+ ROE.
* Eyesan: Focused on return on capital (ROC) and required it to be above industry average.
* Yartseva: Found just 9% median ROE but noted it was growing. Her winners started with modest profitability - gross margins averaged 34.8%, EBIT margins just 3.9%, ROC 6.5%.

Overall, profitability seemed to matter but nothing spectacular to start. Based on these studies, companies should ideally be profitable when you pick them, but you don't need amazing numbers - even 9% ROE may work if it's improving.

**Other Profitability Metrics**

Beyond ROE, several metrics are worth mentioning:

* Return on assets (ROA): Yartseva found coefficients of 0.4 to 1.9, meaning for every 1% increase in ROA, stock returns increased by 0.4% to 1.9% (which is small).
* Return on capital (ROC): Mayer called it critical, Eyesan required above-industry average, and Yartseva found 6.5% median in her winners.
* Operating (EBIT) margins: 82% of Eyesan's winners were profitable at the start, with median EBIT margin of 12%. Among profitable companies, those with >10% margins grew from 48% in 2012 to 85% by 2021; those with >20% margins grew from 17% to 47%.
* EBITDA margins: 30-60% for winners (Eyesan), confirmed significant by Yartseva whose models showed EBITDA margin as a statistically significant predictor with positive coefficients in her initial models.

Notably, according to Eyesan, 74% of winners grew earnings faster than revenue. This means companies were becoming more profitable over time, not just growing sales.

**Multiple Expansion**

Multiple expansion means the market paying more for each dollar of earnings over time (e.g., P/E going from 10x to 20x):

* Mayer: Described ""twin engines"" of earnings growth plus multiple expansion, showing examples of P/E expanding from 3.5x to 26x, which when combined with earnings growth created 100x returns.
* Eyesan: Found 91% of winners had EV/Revenue expansion and 72% had EV/EBITDA expansion.
* Yartseva: While Yartseva didn't isolate multiple expansion as a single variable, her findings strongly suggest valuation changes rather than earnings growth drive multibagger returns.

**Reinvestments**

All studies emphasized reinvestment capability, but with nuance:

* Mayer: Emphasized reinvestment as the most important factor - specifically companies that can reinvest profits at 20%+ returns consistently.
* Eyesan: Discussed how successful M&A strategies and aggressive expansion drove returns for many outperformers.
* Yartseva: Found that if a company's asset growth exceeds its EBITDA growth, returns drop 4-11%. This means companies must invest aggressively BUT only if their earnings are growing fast enough to support that investment.

**Ownership**

Mayer found 7% annual outperformance among owner-operators and quoted Martin Sosnoff's rule that management should own at least 10-20% of the company.

Yartseva noted owner-operators in her sample had significant vested interests (though she didn't test ownership as a specific variable).

Eyesan noted that 67% of outperformers had insider ownership above 5% (vs. 49% in the broader market), but didn't treat this as a defining factor. Instead, he emphasized qualitative signs of management-shareholder alignment like maintaining focus through acquisitions, proper capital allocation, and consistent execution of core strategy.

**Entry Timing**

For timing, buy beaten-down stocks:

* Yartseva: Stock should be near 12-month low at time of purchase.
* Mayer: Highlighted beaten-down, forgotten stocks returning to profitability as prime 100-bagger candidates.
* Eyesan: Found turnarounds deliver strong returns when problems are solvable (like fixing marketing inefficiencies or distribution issues, rather than fundamental product failures).

Yartseva also tested price momentum over various periods and found one-month momentum slightly positive, meaning stocks that rose last month tend to continue rising.

However, 3-6 month momentum was negative - stocks that performed well over the previous quarter or half-year tend to reverse, suggesting multibaggers are volatile and don't follow smooth upward trends.

**Macro Environment**

Interest rates matter. Yartseva quantified that rising Fed rates knock 8-12% off multibagger returns the following year.

This makes sense because multibaggers tend to be smaller companies that likely rely more on external financing and whose future cash flows are worth less when discount rates rise.

**Geographic Shift**

Lastly, Eyesan's data showed that 59% of recent 10-baggers came from Asia:

* India: 91 companies.
* USA: 60 companies.
* Japan: 49 companies.
* China: 34 companies.

This suggests that if you're only looking at US stocks, you're missing a lot of opportunity.

Moreover, this is striking given Asia represents only 10% of global mutual fund portfolios, suggesting massive underallocation to the region.

Eyesan also noted important regional differences in how earnings translate to returns. Markets like India, Japan, and the Nordics show good earnings-to-returns conversion efficiency, while markets like China and Latin America often see earnings growth that doesn't translate well to stock returns.

There was a time weekends disappeared with you. Hours gone between quick check-ins that somehow turned into all-night calls. I can’t even remember when it shifted, only that it felt like there was never enough time, even when you took up every part of my day and I yours.

I don’t miss the big things as much. Not the trips, not the anniversaries, not the pictures that made it look like we had it all figured out. I miss the *ordinary*.

The invisible hours where love lived without anyone noticing.

I miss you handing me my coffee already stirred because you knew the sound of the spoon made me flinch.

I miss how you smiled when I knew the difference between silence that was heavy and silence that was holy. How proud you were that I never confused the two with us.

I miss the way our laughter didn’t need an audience, didn’t even need a reason;  just you and me in a world no one else could understand.

Love isn’t what people make it out to be. It’s not the drama. It’s the safety. No one warned me that the rarest gift would be being allowed to show up messy, unpolished, undone, and not be made to feel like too much.

With you, even the mundane became sacred. With you, I was safe.

And that’s the ghost I carry. Not losing *love* in the movie sense, but losing the one place I could be wholly myself without performing, without proving.

If you ever wonder what you gave me, it wasn’t passion or spectacle. It was rarer: you were a home I didn’t know how badly I needed. And homes like that… you don’t just walk away from.

I have had a lot of nice blueberry coffee’s but never had one so blueberry forward.  This will be a coffee I talk about for years.  I love this about coffee where you try a coffee and you know you may never taste anything like this again.  I still have coffee’s I talk about from 15 years ago.

The other interesting part of this coffee is that if you don’t brew it right, the blueberry is not there.  I ended up with two bags and when switching between bags as I was dialing it and it was gone.  What I figured out, is 1) it drips really slow like many anerobics 2) you only get the blueberry bomb with a high extraction.  Literally a 1/4 of one position on my grinder the coffee went from muddy meh, to spectacular.   I have never seen a coffee be so bipolar.  I could see this coffee confounding folks.

We don’t have a huge budget and it’s a rental so we are limited in what we can do. Part of me feels like I just need to suck it up and drink some coffee and order a bunch of things but I have severe toddler mom decision fatigue.


I need help coming up with a game plan for finishing furnishing our living room, (needs rug, lamps, coffee table and a sideboard that I can change a kid in in a pinch) and the dining room (needs rug, secretary desk, side table, lamp, stool. I also need help figuring out how to make the entry more functional (needs better shoe and coat storage, a radiator cover with some key and random stuff storage and maybe a check your face mirror). I also need wall art or wall decor of some kind and ideally a plan to improve the tread of the stairs (tread covers or stair runner).


It’s just picking it all out within budget and in colors that will work that’s killing me. Truly I could do it in an afternoon online but it’s like my brain freezes. I have a distinct style (warm tones, earthy, dark academia) and some lovely pieces to build off. My creative juices are just dry.


Does anyone know how much would it cost for an interior decorator to help me find these items in a budget? Like is this a 500 dollar ask or more?",2,1757875784.0,interiordecorating,6,0.75,False

1ngza4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/GSP/comments/1ngza4y/my_gsp_is_a_mutant_superhero_that_makes_other/,My GSP is a mutant superhero that makes other GSP’s look like couch potatoes and he’s driving me insane.,"Ok, so first off, read this sentence: I have had 10 dogs including a working line choc lab and a working line GSD, a black mouth cur, and a ridgeback that lived long happy lives with me, so if all you have to offer is “you shouldn’t have gotten a dog”, or “don’t get another dog”, you can kindly piss off. 

Moving on: 

I did all the research. For 2 years. I met other GSP’s. I visited several breeders. I contacted the GSPCA and asked for breeder recommendations. I picked a breeder that does extensive health testing with verifiable records, and furthermore is on the board of the GSPCA. I told them what I was after, which was a pet quality dog that could go hiking and mountain biking with me but was not a psycho at home. 

I got him at 10 weeks old. He is currently 20 months. We did puppy training with a respected trainer. I socialized him extensively with dogs, children, adults, noisy places, etc. When he was a year we did more obedience training with a trainer. We have kept on training. He has good recall, knows all the basic stuff like leave it, drop it, sit, stay, wait, come, down, off, shake, speak, quiet, heel, etc. 

he is e collar trained and responds well to it. 

He has a very good personality, is extremely sweet, he loves other dogs, loves adults after he meets them, does not like kids at all due to their erratic movements and noises. He’s also afraid of big hats and large backpacks for some reason. 

He gets down time in his crate. He doesn’t go in his crate on his own but he’s perfectly fine in there for as long he as needs to be in there. Doesn’t whine or bark or chew or try to destroy the crate. 

He gets about 3 hours a day of off leash time in the national forest, as we live about 10 minutes from it. He also gets 3-4 leash walks per day. He goes to doggy daycare about once a week. 

We also go mountain biking a couple times a week. We usually do 7-10 miles but we’ve done 15-20 a few times. We can go mountain biking 20 miles a day for two days in a row and he will come home, be somewhat calm for about 20 minutes, and then he’s ready to go again. It is literally impossible to wear him out except on the days he goes to daycare. I have also tried giving him less exercise for extended periods (months) because everyone said I was exercising him too much. It did not help at all. 

We do daily training for about 30 mins to an hour a day. It does not make him tired. He does not care about kongs or puzzle toys. Scent work does not make him tired. Having free range of the yard doesn’t help. 

He does put himself to bed at 9pm and sleep until 6 or 7am. Other than that, he literally never stops moving. I am not exaggerating in the slightest. It took him until he was a year and a half old to take a nap without being forced to, and it only lasted about 15 minutes and has only happened a couple times since then. 

Nothing helps. It does not matter how much crate time or exercise or training or mental activity he gets. Literally every day, he just wants to be running 15 hours a day. He is not neurotic or destructive and has no OCD behaviors. He gets a ton of my time and attention. He just wants to run. All the time. Like literally all the time. 

If he’s in the house during the day, he is moving. Period. Non stop. The entire time. And usually, also whining to go out. If we are outside and he’s running, he’s happy as can be. 

The ONLY time he ever is just calm, is after a full day at daycare. Not a half day, only a full day works. The daycare said he’s the only dog they’ve ever had that has never taken a nap at daycare, and there are several other GSP’s and other working dogs there. 

I told the breeder all of this a few months ago and they revealed to me that his parents and grandparents were all grand champion dual champions in field and show. So I didn’t get a pet quality dog and they basically sold him to me because he was small and had a couple small aesthetic features that made him not show quality. So I got a mutant superhero god tier unstoppable force meth addict Olympic athlete that makes even other GSP’s look like 14 year old labs.  

I love him to death and we are super bonded and he is the sweetest silliest cuddliest dog but he’s making me insane. My entire life revolves around this dog. It’s like having not just a second full time job, but a second overtime job that barely leaves me time for my regular full time job. I don’t want to rehome him but I’m considering giving him to a hunter with like 100 acres of land and other GSP’s, because I can’t take it. Yesterday was my day off and I spent the whole day just managing his exercise needs. I put him in daycare today just so I could have a few hours to relax and sit on a bench in the park with some coffee without having to hear the whining or deal with the pacing or have him have to be in a crate at home, and I don’t want to go hiking for two hours this morning because I’ve done it literally every day for the last several months. 

I spent last winter walking him outside on a Nordic skiing loop 3 hours a day in -20 degree weather and I’m honestly just dreading doing it again this winter. ",2,1757875470.0,GSP,21,0.6,False

I (24f) told my fiancé (30m) what I wanted to do in the AM [walk and go get a drink from either the store/coffee place] he said he couldn’t do anything before he ate and I told him I wanted to make pancakes but I’d really like a drink (because it sets the tone for me, like it makes me feel like I’m having a slow Sunday) but he ends up making the pancakes which I guess I was fine with and I did the dishes/ feeding the dogs. But he told me the pancakes were ready and so I ate mine and he was still making the food. I left the table and put my plate up then went outside to play with the dogs inside I heard him say “hey!” Loudly twice and then he opened the door to the Patio and said, “come in” pretty loudly, the neighbors were outside and could hear(we just had a situation with their dogs getting onto our property) and I was taking a cute video of our dog. I was upset at him that he told me to come inside it felt like I need to be with him when he is ready, so I said “be quiet” he left and I came inside and he started talking about news and I just started to feel so lethargic like no energy was in me. He told me I needed to apologize to him and recounted it like I told him “shut up!” Which I never have and never would, mind you the last two big fights we had he told me to shut up. He said he’s been apologizing to me a lot these past weeks and I told him then that isn’t real apologizes since he’s doing it for something in return. It feels like he uses us getting into a fight for fuel. Like how he’d playing piano which he hasn’t done in months and we just had sex this morning for the first time in weeks. I began to cry when it got heated and he said, “you upset me, why are you crying!?” I get scared when we are that escalated or in fights since he has made a hole in the primary bedroom on the door by slamming his forehead into it while we were fighting. I thought we were done with this chapter in our life but now instead of it being a miscommunication it feels like all day we won’t speak and the same thing happened yesterday too. Where he ignored me because I wouldn’t apologize over something I said. He brings up apologizing this past week because he yelled at the dogs because they went to the restroom in the primary since he took the door off the room to fix the hole he made and didn’t put it on and I got upset he yelled at the dogs and he felt so much “woe is me/shame” he didn’t text me the entire day. And the communication is what he is supposed to be working on. Idk what to do or if I’m in a relationship with a big baby or if I should just ‘bow’ down and apologize. 


I do want to add I come into whatever room he is in and try to strike up convos or go do something and he will not budge. He is stuck on it and he brings up that I lock the door to my room but it’s since so many of the times he’s come in he has yelled or scared me I feel the need to lock the door if I’m not ready to speak or fight with him and he basically uses him trying to come in while the door is locked as him trying to communicate ",0,1757875352.0,TwoXChromosomes,3,0.22,False

1ngz3rs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1ngz3rs/reached_2nd_goal_some_things_to_share/,Reached 2nd goal - some things to share,"Ladies and gentlemen, I’m proud to report that I reached my second goal on Sunday, September 14th.  This is exactly 9 months to the day since I started on Zepbound on December 14, 2024.

I was on 2.5 for 1 month and lost 19 pounds in the first month.  I was on 5.0 from mid-January to early April and lost another 13 pounds.  I went to 7.5 and gained a bit, but then started dropping.  I ended up another \~13 pounds down on 7.5, though was stagnant for about 2 months.  Then in mid-July I went to 10 and that ramped things up.  I’m still losing on 10 and do not plan to go to a higher dose.  I’ll see how things go over the next month or so and then will talk with my doctor about scaling back.  I really do hope I can eventually get off Zepbound.

Today I weighed in at 210, which is my 2nd goal.  My first goal was 225 and I hit that back in late April.  I started this journey at 267, so I’m down 57 pounds.  For my height, I really should be 185-190 to be in the “healthy” zone, but I’m going to try and sustain instead of losing more.  If I lose more that’s fine, but no longer the goal.

I thought I’d share a few notes and thoughts that may be helpful for somebody (in no particular order):

1. I have a daily routine related to supplements.  I take 2 fiber gummies (Olly brand) and 2 men’s multi vitamin (Olly) in the morning.  In the evening, after dinner I take 4 “Relaxing Magnesium” (Olly), 2 more fiber gummies and 2 Tums.  I tried for a long time to figure out the constipation routine, coupled with acid reflux and heartburn.  This routine has proven to be really good for me.
2. For breakfast each day, I have a protein shake and a bowl of berries (strawberries, blueberries and blackberries).  I do this without fail every single day, and I don’t find myself missing or wanting anything different.
3. I have coffee with half and half.  I have not given that up, but I don’t drink more than 2 cups.
4. I weigh myself every morning now under the exact same circumstances.  I have coffee and ensure I’ve “done my business” before I weigh myself.  I ensure I’ve peed and I’m about as “empty” as I possibly can be.  I do it naked and I do it 3 times to ensure the digital scale has accurate readings.  Interestingly, I also find that I need to weigh myself before the shower as after the shower I’m always heavier.  I think the epidermis absorbs water.
5. I have the same salad for lunch.  We have a salad station at work and I ask for lettuce, chicken, bacon bits, shredded cheddar cheese, roasted red peppers, hard boiled eggs, cucumbers, croutons and craisins and low-fat balsamic dressing.  I put all this here to demonstrate I’ve not given up on the flavors that I like.  I just do it in moderation.  I never eat the entire salad.
6. We have a protein and veg or salad for dinner.  Rarely do we weave in a starch anymore.
7. I \*\*might\*\* have a dessert once per week.  There are no real cravings.
8. From January to \~May I was pretty religious in the gym.  I’m dealing with a shoulder injury now and haven’t done as much.  I really need to get back to some weight training as soon as I can do it without pain as I do feel I’ve lost muscle mass.
9. I take the stairs at work exclusively.  I’m up and down 3 flights of stairs multiple times per day.  I would be huffing and puffing if I walked those stairs last December.  Now I sometimes take 2 at a time.  Because I can.
10. I’ve noticed my sleep has degraded on Zepbound.  I really have trouble getting good sleep, especially on shot night (Friday) and the night after.  But I rarely get a great night of sleep anymore.  One other interesting thing about sleep: I’m a side-sleeper and I can feel my knees bumping into each other.  My rib cage also is oddly noticeable!  All the padding protecting my legs and chest / stomach are gone.
11. I’ve had to reinvest in new clothes.  My 2x and 3x clothes are gone.  They’re never coming back.  I have XL for shirts, though I have a few L size that fit nicely.  I’ve dropped from 40-42 waist to 36, and I’ll argue I may be able to fit in 34.  I waited a long time to reinvest in clothes though.
12. I’ve had a ton of comments from people at work noticing the weight loss.  It almost seems like a taboo thing to talk about, but I welcome th e conversation.
13. I know of a few other people on Zepbound at work.  I’m not afraid of sharing with anybody that GLP1 is the main reason I’ve lost so much weight.  I wish it was more widely available.
14. I see my doctor every three months to check blood work and just monitor things.  I had to get prior authorization again about a month ago and I had to submit proof of my starting weight and my current weight to show my BMI.  Thank goodness I track everything in Shotsy.
15. I used to take blood pressure medicine, but I don’t anymore.  I used to get terrible gout attacks too.  My uric acid level has not really changed all that much much but I don’t actively take Allopurinol.  I had a light attack about a month ago.  I have no idea what caused the flare.
16. I was never a big drinker, but I do love a good glass of wine.  I rarely had a beer or mixed drink.  I don't crave any alcohol at all now, and maybe I've had 6 glasses of wine in 9 months.

Food volume is key, in my opinion.  I still have a burger, though I have trouble eating a whole one.  I still have pizza.  2 slices and not half the pie.  I eat mostly lean protein and lots of greens, with minimal starches.  I think I’ve learned really good food habits and have a different relationship with food now.

This is all I can really think about sharing.  I hope some of it is interesting or useful to folks.

1ngyxzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/1ngyxzx/i_believe_my_neighborhood_has_the_nicest_bus/,I believe my neighborhood has the nicest bus driver ever,"I would like to say sorry in advance because I did come from Click's video and I believe it has to have flooded the sub a bit, but I thought about this mas as soon as I found out this subreddit exists. It's less of a single grandiose act of kindness and more of many sprinkled throughout my time knowing him.
I have lived in the same neighborhood as long as I can remember and get around with public transportation quite a lot as a Uni student. We have one bus that comes every hour, and the one I see more often than not  is who I'm going to call ""W"". 
First of all, you know exactly who's driving the bus before even stepping in with W because he is always playing music. Can be annoying to some people, he mostly plays sertanejo which is a very popular genre where I live and I don't particularly enjoy it, but I always appreciate how upbeat he always is and the music is part of that, he is genuinely having fun. 
He calls everybody by nicknames - I have been dubbed ""minha joinha"", which roughly translates to little jewel and it's more commonly used with children despite me being a grown adult - and it isn't a one-off or something like that he has a term of endearment for almost all his regulars and he never messes it up, he knows exactly who each of us are, which brings me to my next point:
Once, when I got the late bus on a weekend, I was  the last one to be dropped off and he asked me where I would like to stop. I showed him where he could stop closest to my house and, that day, which must've been more than a year ago, he dropped me at my house and has literally never forgotten. Every time the bus is empty enough he drops me off where it is most convenient to me and I'm not the only one. For mostly elders and people with mobility issues, he does it on a more regular basis: as I said, he recognizes everyone that gets in his bus so sometimes he sees someone getting on and immediately goes ""Sorry guys, I'm gonna grop Mrs. X here and then I'll get to the next stop"" and drop who needs it where it's the most helpful to them.
I've seen him get off his post on the wheel (when the bus is stopped at a bus stop, of course) to help little kids (young enouth to not pay the fee) pass the turnstile, grabbing them and ""flying"" them over it like they're superman. I've seen him leave the bus entirely to help people get their groceries or whatever they need to get inside the bus. I've seen him leave the bus at stops to help people who are confused by pointing which roads to walk in order to get to where they need to go. 
There's this woman that, most days, is at the bus stop at 4 o'clock pm. I will try to express this as respectfully as I can with the little i formation I have, I would guess she has a developmental disorder or something of the sorts by the way she behaves in more child-like manners and speech. She LOVES busses. She is always incredibly happy to see the bus and I've seen W, every single day in a week sometimes, indulge her and have a mini party at her stop, honking the horn and excitedly talking to her.
He's friends with practically everybody in the neighborhood. There's a little bakery on one of the stops that sometimes gives him coffee apparently for free, reaching in the bus' windows while people are getting on and off.
I just wanted to sing him some praises, even if he never does see it, because he makes public transportation better. Even if I'm having a shitty day, I get on W's bus and see him joking around with kids, helping people and being a genuinely kind person and it reminds me that people can indeed be good.
Hope you're having a great day!",9,1757874694.0,randomactsofkindness,2,0.92,False

1ngyxe3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1ngyxe3/why_choosing_the_right_coffee_bag_manufacturer/,Why Choosing the Right Coffee Bag Manufacturer Matters,"When it comes to packaging coffee, the bag it comes in is more than just a container—it's a powerful tool that influences freshness, flavor, branding, and even customer satisfaction. Whether you're a small-batch roaster or a large-scale producer, choosing the right coffee bag manufacturer can make a significant difference in your business's success. Here's why it matters so much.

**1. Preserving Freshness and Flavor**  
Coffee is a delicate product that reacts to air, moisture, light, and temperature. A well-manufactured coffee bag offers multiple layers of protection to keep the beans or grounds fresh for longer. Oxygen and moisture barriers are crucial in preventing spoilage and staleness. The right bag manufacturer will ensure their materials meet these preservation needs, helping maintain the rich aroma and flavor of your coffee from roastery to cup.

**2. Boosting Your Brand Identity**  
Packaging is often the first impression customers have of your product. A professionally designed and well-crafted coffee bag elevates your brand, attracting customers on the shelf and building loyalty. A quality manufacturer offers customization options—such as matte or gloss finishes, resealable zippers, degassing valves, and vibrant printing—that reflect your brand’s personality and values. It’s your silent salesperson that communicates quality before the first sip is even taken.

**3. Sustainability Matters**  
Consumers today are more eco-conscious than ever. A responsible coffee bag manufacturer can offer sustainable solutions, including compostable or recyclable materials, which align with your environmental goals. Choosing a manufacturer who prioritizes sustainability not only helps the planet but also resonates with your audience’s values.

**4. Efficiency and Scalability**  
As your business grows, so do your packaging needs. A dependable coffee bag manufacturer can scale production efficiently without compromising on quality. They can meet bulk demands and tight timelines, giving you the reliability needed to expand operations confidently.

**5. Compliance and Quality Assurance**  
Coffee packaging must often meet food safety regulations. A reputable manufacturer will adhere to industry standards, providing peace of mind with quality control checks and certifications that ensure your product is safe for consumption.

At the beginning of your supply chain journey, aligning with the right **coffee bag wholesale** manufacturer sets the tone for your brand's professionalism and product integrity. Don’t treat packaging as an afterthought. It’s a key player in your coffee’s journey—from your hands to the customer’s cup. Investing time in selecting the right partner will yield lasting rewards in quality, reputation, and customer loyalty.",1,1757874655.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

THE INHERITORS


They were in the office-place.

The lights hummed, bright and endless.

Screens glowed. Keys tapped.

The women bent over their desks. They made the little smiles. They nodded at each other.

“This is work,” they thought.

“This is how the society stays alive.”

But in the corners, unseen, the New Ones had come.

They were quick. They did not tire. They made no mistakes.

The women did not understand their speech, but the speech was sharp, faster than fingers, faster than thought.

The women laughed nervously. They did the old rituals. They sent messages, they clicked, they circled back.

But the New Ones did not laugh. The New Ones only worked.

A fear crept into the women’s bellies.

“Will they take the tasks? Will they take the place at the table?”

And already, the place at the table was gone.

The women clutched their coffee mugs, warm in their hands. They whispered about meetings, about fairness, about rights.

But the silence of the screens grew heavier. The glow of the blinking lights crept closer.

And the women understood, though they could not say it:

the world was no longer theirs.

1ngyv2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ngyv2w/my_father_is_a_biohazardous_waste_disposal/,My father is a biohazardous waste disposal facility,"A couple days ago I(25F) got a call from my dad, (68M) telling me that my mom had gotten mad at him for eating her sandwich. Understandable, right? He ate my mother's (69F) ham and cheese sandwich, and because of that she's angry. Wrong. 
My parents have a small counter top compost can that they put coffee grounds, vegetable ends, and scraps meant for the chickens. That is where my father found my mother's sandwich, lying there atop the rest of scraps: uncovered. A grave mistake: because upon seeing the sandwich he apparently couldn't restrain himself. 
My father asked my mother why she threw it away. Her response? ""Why did you eat that? It'd been in the car for 5 days!"" He called me to complain about this, in his view, unwarranted criticism. 
I don't understand why he won't die from constantly eating food from the trash. He has pilfered food from dumpsters, homeless camps, and composts bins. All that, and his lifespan has been longer than his perfectly normal father who died at 45. I think his chronic alcoholism must be perversely saving him from the brink of death. He's done stuff like this my whole life, and only after moving out of home have I realized how gross this is (among other things). ",73,1757874508.0,TrueOffMyChest,43,0.97,False

47 days!

This week, I was overjoyed to see the first signs of my favorite holiday of the year - Halloween. Yes, I like Halloween even more than Christmas, because while you get gifts/treats for both events, All Hallows’ Eve allows one to take on a different persona. So rad!

In addition to the ceramic pumpkin on the picnic table, there was a box of Halloween lights for street rehoming and a very scary (but nice smelling) two-sided stuffed monster

There was some drama earlier last week on Willow Street when residents heard meowing coming from the engine compartment of a parked vehicle. In no time ACO Emily Crum was on the scene and all ended well. Thanks Officer Crum for your great service to our community and your compassion for animals.

There were other animal activities present on Alameda streets this past week. Take the group of turkeys that decided this car parked on Alameda Avenue was a great place to roost. I imagine a trip to the car wash was in order.

Also appearing on Alameda streets was the aftermath of a fender bender on Central Avenue at Union Street where a car coming from Union Street which is controlled by a stop sign hit the white car travelling on Central Avenue with having the right of way. The insurance companies should have fun with this one. I have two 12’ bully sticks to bet that the insurance goes up for both cars.

There has been a lot of coverage regarding Accessory Dwelling Units (ADU) and encouraging residents to build one in their backyard. Well, someone took it a bit further and placed this three story ADU on the sidewalk. I thought there was a height limit on these things??

Other weird stuff that folks left on the sidewalk this week included a bunch of boxes of Nabisco Saltine crackers. Seems like a better way to off load these boxes would be o drop them off at the Alameda Food bank.  I hear that there are so many more people depending on the food bank for basic meals these days.

The artist at Feed Good Bakery did a nice job capturing the Peanuts gang and my hero Snoopy with a back-to-school themed tip jar. By the way, their cheese sticks are really good, but the seeds get stuck in my teeth.

I will end this report with a big bark out to Coffee Cultures for having free dog treats available and for such a cute container.

OH! If you are wondering what the significance of 47 days is  .  .  . well that’s how many days ‘till Halloween.

1ngysqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ngysqv/the_quiet_ones_part_2/,The Quiet Ones (Part 2),"I learned to move softly, though there was no one to wake. The house made a ceremony of silence, and I found myself performing it: cups set down with two fingers; doors pushed until the latch caught without a click; a measured tread that sought the parts of the floor that did not complain. Even breathing felt suspect, an offense offered to an audience I could not see. 

During the day, the house seemed to hold its breath. Dust motes drifted in the slanted light, indifferent to me, and the lace curtains stirred in a draft that had no evident source. I took inventory of what was mine by inheritance—an assortment of more solid than comfortable furniture, a trunk of old clothes that smelled like mummified lavender, a desk with drawers that stuck halfway before relenting. I found a notebook bound in cracking brown leather in the bottom drawer. 

My cousin’s handwriting was cramped, the letters shouldering one another like people trying to pass in a narrow hall. 

Feb. 9 — They were quiet last night. Too quiet. When the silence gets thick, they are nearer. 
 
Feb. 14 — I dropped a spoon. Foolish. I swear the sound broke into a thousand shards. I retrieved them all, but the floor remembered. The floor always remembers. 
 
Feb. 23 — Rules must be kept.  
1)	Never speak of them inside the rooms.  
2)	Never investigate the seam between floorboards after dark.  
3)	Fill the cracks with cloth only in the morning. They do not like to be veiled at night.  
4)	If the scratching moves with you, leave the room backwards. 

There were more entries, some smudged by what might have been rain or sweat—or tears, though I doubted my cousin had been a man given to those. 

I closed the notebook and sat very still, listening, as if the words themselves might carry a rustle. 

By habit more than courage, I returned to Mr. Hale. In daylight, his inn lost some of its menace; the wide windows admitted so much light that the dust on the floorboards had nowhere to hide. The old man raised his eyes when I entered, his towel poised mid-wipe as though he were waiting to be convinced of something and expected to be disappointed. 

“I found a book,” I said, taking a stool. “My cousin kept rules.” 

Hale’s expression did not alter, yet something in him tightened, like a rope wound one turn further than necessary. “Rules,” he said. “It begins with rules and ends with bargains.” 

“What do they want?” I asked. 

“The same thing we all want.” He leaned closer. “To be heard.” 

It was a preposterous answer, yet it lodged in my mind with a stubborn plausibility. The sounds in the night—scraping, a breath drawn near the floor—were too precise to be the accidents of wood and vermin. They seemed like rehearsals; notes held a fraction too long. 

“Did my cousin… bargain?” I asked. 

Hale straightened and resumed wiping the counter. “Some here bargain with the winter, some with the sea, and some with the earth under their houses. Your cousin stayed long. Long enough that people stopped asking about him. Long enough that the house learned him.” 

“I don’t intend to stay.” I said it for his benefit, and for the part of myself that still saw exits. 

He nodded, neither convinced nor relieved. “Do not speak of them in the rooms,” he said. “That’s one of the rules, isn’t it?” 

I didn’t ask how he knew.

Nights adopted a shape. I would lie in the narrow bed with the chair braced under the doorknob—a superstition more than a precaution—and wait for the house to finish settling. It never did. The settling was infinite, a patience that could not be exhausted. Boards sighed; the rafters cracked like knuckles; somewhere, water worked its way through pipes that should have been dry. And then, from the baseboards or the closet or directly under the bed, another sound would begin: a faint chafing, as of cloth rubbed against wood. Not quite movement. Not quite stillness. 

I had the idea that if I could remain perfectly still, the house would forget me. But stillness has edges, and the body betrays itself. A swallow, a shift of weight, the involuntary sigh of someone who has realized he has been holding his breath too long—all these were too much.

The third night after finding the notebook, I woke to the sensation that someone else had exhaled. It was not the sound itself—barely a whisper—but the shape of it: the way a breath fills a space and leaves it altered. I opened my eyes and met the ceiling, where the moth-gray plaster sagged between beams like sails on a windless sea.

“Not tonight,” I said, and clapped a hand over my own mouth, the rule glaring in my mind like a lantern: Do not speak of them in the rooms.

But I had not spoken of them, only to them, and the shiver that went through the floor—yes, a shiver—suggested the distinction was not appreciated. 

I did not sleep again. 

The next day I explored the house with a performative casualness, as though indifference could be an amulet. The kitchen offered little—iron pans, their surfaces blackened and gleaming like old obsidian; a basin with a hairline crack that traced the shape of a map I could not place. The cellar door stuck but opened when I leaned my shoulder against it. Cool air breathed up from the darkness, smelling of stone damp and bruised earth. 

I did not go down. 

Instead, I wandered to the back parlor where a narrow window framed the yard. Beyond the splitting fence, the property sloped toward a corpse of sickly birch whose paper bark hung in curls. A path, scarcely more than a lighter ribbon through the grass, led into the trees. My cousin had walked it often, judging by the faint regularity of the tread. People carve habits into the earth as readily as into themselves. 

I found another note there slipped between the parlor’s baseboard and the wall, hardly more than a scrap. It bore three words in a hand that had trembled: They remember names. 

Names of who? Names of those who had lived here? Names spoken aloud? I carried the scrap to the desk as if it might disintegrate in stronger light. The desk had an upper pigeonhole I had not noticed before. Inside were folded letters, sealed and slit. Most were receipts, always with the same name on the ledger line: Elias Corbett, my cousin. One, however, wore a different hand and a different name. 

Miss Ada Bell, it began. I must beg you again not to visit. It is not a matter of decorum but of health. The house is not well. I do not mean this metaphorically. A sick house infects its tenants in ways a doctor cannot treat. You will not be safe here. The letter ended without salutation. 

I read the lines until they blurred. The name Ada Bell rubbed splinters of recognition into me, and after a moment I recalled why: in the village I had passed a shop whose sign read A. Bell, Haberdashery & Mending. I had thought the lettering quaint. Now it seemed an address to an absence. 

She was younger than I expected, not much older than myself, with a kite-shaped face and the sort of steadiness one mistakes for coldness. Bells threaded the door of her shop; they chimed when I entered, their sound unnervingly bright after so many days of muffled steps. 

“What needs mending?” she asked without looking up, and only when I did not answer promptly did, she raise her eyes. 

“You’re Ada Bell,” I said, realizing the gracelessness of it as it left my mouth. 

“Some days.” She put down her needle. “What is it you want mended?” 

I took the letter from my pocket and set it on the counter. She did not touch it. Her gaze flicked to the paper, then to my face, then to my hands, as if checking for some telltale mark. 

“You’re Elias’s kin,” she said, not a question. 

“I’m… the inheritor of his house.” I almost said guest, as if that would absolve me. “He wrote to you.” 

“He wrote many letters,” she answered. “Most of them not to me.” 

“Did you visit him?” 

“I did not,” she said, and the bells in the door stirred faintly though it had not opened. “He forbade it. I keep to the living and their threads. Elias”—she let the name sit a moment, as if testing the air for consequences— “he kept to the seams.”

“The seams?” I asked. 

“The places where one thing meets another,” she said. “Floor to wall. Door to jamb. Words to meanings.” She reached under the counter and withdrew a small tin; its lid scratched with years of use. Inside lay neat rolls of cloth—binding tape, surely—but she handled them as though they were bandages. “Did he tell you about mornings?” 

“The notes said to fill the cracks with cloth only in the morning.” 

Ada nodded. “Because morning is the hour of claims. Night is for listening; morning is for deciding what to live with.” 

“And what did you decide?” I asked before I could stop myself. 

She glanced toward the window, where the light had sharpened to a thin, almost surgical brightness. “I decided not to marry him.” 

The statement felt like the end of a conversation I had not heard begin. “Because of the house?” 

“Because of silence,” she said. 

“I don’t understand.” 

“You will,” she said, not unkindly. “If you stay.” 

She pushed the tin toward me. “Take it. Binding tape for the cracks, to honor his rule. But do it in the morning. If you do it at night, you’re closing the mouth while it’s speaking.” 

“What happens if—” 

“Don’t,” she said, with the exhausted patience of someone who has stepped aside from a precipice so many times that she no longer bothers to describe the fall. “Just don’t.” 

I left the shop with the tin under my arm, the bells stitching a cheerful seam behind me. 

That evening—the sky raw-lipped with cold as the sun withdrew—I performed the ritual of the house. I set the chair by the door. I laid the tin of binding tape on the bedside table like a 
communion wafer I had no intention of taking. I read my cousin’s notebook until the words turned from language to pattern, and from pattern to texture. 

There is a particular kind of fear that is less a spike than a low-grade fever. It warms the mind, making it pliable. Thoughts soften. Rules begin to feel like explanations rather than constraints. By midnight, I had persuaded myself that if I only addressed whatever shared the house with me, I could set terms. Speak the rules aloud, make of them a contract. The idea was absurd, but absurdity is a kind of courage when one is alone. 

I rose, took the notebook, and stood in the center of the bedroom. The floorboards felt subtly concave, as if the house were a bowl and I a crumb rolling toward its center. 

“I will not speak of you,” I said carefully, avoiding the pronoun that the note had warned against. 
“I will not look into the seams after dark. I will fill the cracks in the morning.” 

The sensation that followed was not a sound but the expectation of sound, like the hush before an orchestra raises its bows. I felt noticed—no, counted, the way one counts coin. The quiet gathered weight, pressed against the walls, bulged the corners of the room. I had the absurd impression that if someone opened the door, silence would spill out into the hall and clot there. 

“I will not—” I began, but a different rule asserted itself, the one not written that a man should not break the surface of a stillness he does not understand. 

I closed my mouth and sat on the bed, fingers digging into the coverlet to keep them from trembling. 

At some unfixed hour, the scraping began. It moved along the baseboard, stopped opposite the bed, and—this is an oddity I report without flourish—tilted. As if a head had cocked to listen. 

I laid very still. Minutes lengthened; my name, which I had not spoken aloud since arriving, crowded my throat. They remember names, the scrap had said. It struck me then that a name is not merely a word but a handle, and I imagined myself lifted by mine, carried. I swallowed hard and thought of anything else: the number of steps from the bedroom to the parlor, the names of state capitals, the species of birds that nested in birches. I had never been so grateful for inventory. 

The scraping resumed, softer now, almost tender. A sigh—not mine—threaded the room and drew back. Another followed, nearer the door. Then the faintest tap from the hall, as if something had put its weight against the other side and found the chair there. 

The chair did not move. The rule held. 

I did not sleep. 

Morning—by which I mean a thinning of the dark rather than an assurance of safety—brought me to the baseboards with the tin. I pressed strips of cloth into the widest seams, the way one dams a leak without understanding the pressure behind the water. The tape took on a grayness as it drank the dust and oil of the wood. It felt indecent, plugging a gap someone else used to breathe. 

When I finished, I sat back on my heels and listened. The house, insulted, said nothing. I told myself I had done well. I told myself rules were bridges, not walls. Yet when I stood, I swayed, the way one does on a ship even after reaching shore, the floor not entirely certain of being floor. 

At the desk, I opened the notebook to a page I had overlooked. The entry was brief, as if written in haste: 

March 3 — If you must speak, do it in the hall. The rooms are theirs. The hall is a throat; the doors are teeth. 

I looked from the page to the hall. It lay there unlit, its carpet runner the color of old blood oranges, the walls holding shadow even at noon. Doors lined it, each with its keyhole black as a pupil. 

I stood in the hall and said nothing. 

The house, from the depth of its throat, said nothing back. 

I began to understand why Elias had written so many rules. If the world narrows, law becomes a way to feel it still has edges. When the rules fail, you must either admit you are lost or invent more rules. 

That night, I tried another ritual. I placed a glass of water in the middle of the bedroom floor. “For you,” I said—to no one, to the room, to my own folly—but softly, a feathered utterance not quite speech. I sat on the bed and wrapped my hands around my knees to make them smaller. 

The quiet became attentive. 

I waited. 

The water looked back at me with a single trembling eye. The surface quivered, then smoothed, then trembled again, a pulse rather than a draft. I had the distinct image of lips about to meet the glass but not quite finding the shape. It was unbearable—this almost-contact, this rehearsal of thirst—more unbearable than any definite intrusion would have been. I reached forward in a reflexive, apologetic gesture as if to steady the glass, and immediately the air withdrew. The tremor ceased. The attention cooled like breath across a burn. 

“I’m sorry,” I whispered, and then flinched at my own apology. 

The water remained, unspilled, undrunk. 

I slept, if I slept, inside the kind of silence that bruises. 

On the fifth morning, the chair had shifted. Not much—an inch, two at most—but enough that the imprint of its legs on the rug did not match the holes worn into the nap. I knelt to compare them, as if a precise measurement would offer comfort. It did not. The wood of the chair back was warm where I touched it, as if it had been held recently. 

I laughed then, a single dry bark that felt stolen from someone else. I carried the chair back to its place under the knob and pressed it there with a firmness that would have looked like anger to anyone watching. There was, of course, no one watching. There never is—until there is. 

“You are not leaving,” I told the chair, not the house, not myself. The rule about the hall hissed across my mind like rain on a stove. I stepped into the hall and repeated it, louder: “You are not leaving.” 

The words held the faintest echo, as though some architectural quirk returned them to me. Not leaving, came the ghost of my own voice, made thinner by distance. 

“Good,” I said, and felt ridiculous. 

Back in the room, I stood very still and listened, as I always did, incubating dread like an egg. After a long time—long enough that the day’s light had turned the color of steeped tea—the floor answered, not with a scrape but with a kind of arranging. As if the house, like a host, prepared itself. A faint shiver traveled through the wood; a loosened nail acknowledged its looseness; the bed frame made the sound that beds always make when someone lies down upon them. 

I did not move. 

I did not turn. 

I did not breathe. 

The mattress dipped, delicately, as though testing whether it would hold. It held. A presence— not weight, exactly, but the intention of weight—settled beside me, careful as a nurse with a sleeping child. 

A voice formed near my ear, less heard than shaped from the inside of my skull. It was not words, not at first, but cadence, a slow adjustment toward speech, like a mouth relearning vowel after exile. 

I had the impression—I must stress that it was only that—of someone saying my name without sound. 

I kept my own name behind my teeth the way one keeps a bird cupped in two hands. 

We lay like that—my body in a posture of statuesque calm, my mind a frantic pendulum—until something softer than a breath, colder than a shadow, touched the place on my neck where a pulse confesses itself. 

Then, as if satisfied by the geometry of fear, the presence withdrew. The mattress un-dipped. The house completed its arrangement and waited for the next. 

I went to the inn at noon, because standing under ordinary voices felt briefly like being washed. Mr. Hale watched me the way one watches a sailor walking on land—kindly, skeptically, prepared to catch me when the ground surprises me. 

“You are paler,” he observed. 

“Am I?” I asked and heard the ice where a joke should have been. 

He poured me coffee that tasted like earth and time. “Have you learned their names?” he asked. 

“I’d prefer not to,” I said, the tin of binding tape suddenly heavy under my arm again though I had left it at the house. 

“Prefer all you like,” Hale said, not unkindly. “A house like that is a mouth. You can decline to speak, but you cannot refuse to be spoken.” 

I thought of Ada, of the neat, compassionate way she had declined the future that the house insisted upon. I thought of my cousin Elias, who had written rules until the rules themselves had become a dwelling more intimate than any room. 

“What happens,” I asked, “if a man breaks the rules?” 

Hale wiped the counter again, though it did not need wiping. “He learns new ones.” 

He let the answer sit. After a moment, he added, “And the learning is loud.” 

I closed my eyes against a sudden, ridiculous urge to weep. When I opened them, the world had resumed its ordinary proportions. The coffee had cooled. Outside, a boy ran past the window with a kite made from newspaper, the string singing faintly in the wind. 

I finished the cup and stood. “Thank you,” I said. 

“For the coffee?” Hale asked. 

“For the noise,” I said. 

He smiled then, briefly. “Bring some with you when you go,” he said. “You won’t, of course. But it’s good to be told.” 

On my way home—home, I thought, startling myself, whose home? —I took the path toward the birches. The white bark, flayed in curling strips, made the grove look like a field of unfinished letters. The path led me to a shallow depression where leaves had gathered. In the center, halfcovered by wet paper birch, lay an object resembling a small door, though it had no hinges and no knob. Just a fitted board, old and stained, laid into the ground like a lid. 

I stood over it until the wind convinced me I had done enough standing. Then I crouched and brushed the leaves away with careful fingers. 

There were marks incised into the wood—faint, half-erased by weather. Not letters, not any alphabet I knew, but strokes interrupted and resumed, the beginnings of forms that had lost their memory. I traced one with the tip of a finger. It caught like a burr. 

Do not look into the seam after dark, the notebook had warned. This was not a seam, precisely, but it had the intention of a seam: the place where one thing met another, wrongfully. I replaced the leaves, as if re-clothing a body, and wiped my hand against my coat as though I had touched something indecent. 

Back at the house, I entered by the kitchen and stood for a long while without moving, as if my stillness could smooth my thoughts. The afternoon light came in at an angle that made the air visible. I watched dust make and unmake constellations. I was nearly calm when I heard a new sound. 

It came from the hall—a soft sliding, like paper being drawn from an envelope. I stepped to the doorway, and there, on the runner, lay a sheet of the notebook I had not left there. My cousin’s hand, cramped and scabbed with ink: 

March 9 — They dislike the name of God less than their own. 
 
March 10 — Do not answer when they ask, ‘Who is there?’ It is not a question. It is a net. 

Beneath these, written with a different pressure, the pen biting the paper: 

If you must walk at night, walk backward. 
I did not remember turning the page, yet when I looked down another entry had appeared—no, not appeared; I had flipped to it, unknowing: 

March 12 — Ada, do not come. 

I carried the loose page back to the desk and replaced it in the binding with hands that felt less like mine than like gloves filled with someone else’s heat. In the bedroom, the glass of water sat where I had left it. A thin film had formed on its surface, the way water sometimes skins itself when left too long. I lifted it to the window. The film held, trembling, then broke with a sound so soft I doubted it had sounded at all. 

For reasons I could not explain, the break relieved me more than it frightened me. Things that break announce they are not infinite. 

Night gathered itself beneath the trees; the birches wore the dark like coal scuttle veils. I performed the ritual—chair, tape, notebook—moving with a precision that felt borrowed from a time when I had practiced other rituals: wash, shave, tie, leave. The house listened or pretended to. 

When I finally lay down, it lay down too. 

We were, I realized, learning each other’s breathing. 

That should have comforted me. It did not. 

Because in the dark—on the other side of the chair-braced door, down the hall that was a throat, past the parlor where dust rehearsed its falling—I heard a whisper, the kind made not by lips but by edges. It was not a question. It was the shape of a question. 

Who— 

It waited, like the end of a rope thrown toward me. 

I did not take hold. 

The rope waited. 

Sleep, when it came, was a negotiation rather than a surrender. 

And in that thin sleep, something smiled in a way that had no face.

I connected it to some other tendencies I've noticed over the years, like ignoring hunger or thirst, not feeling the effect of coffee, etc. I've became more convinced that the suggestions of ""getting in touch with one's body"" is not just some nonsense talk but an actual real process with definite results.

One hypothesis I can propose is that this disconnect from the body allows one to be more objective in one's thinking characteristicof INTPs, where the particularities of one's situation do not influence one's reasoning. On the other hand, it can contribute to the feeling of detachment, ungroudedness, as if there's a barrier between thinking and action, hence constant procrastination.

I am 34 years old. I am not barista or anything, I am just a guy who loves to cook and drink Turkish coffee too much. 
RULES:
1- do NOT use any Turkish coffee machine, NEVER! Why? Because they cook Turkish coffee very fast and they boil it. Use Jezve, not so important it is copper or not.
2-Cook it very SLOWLY on low heat/flame, in the Ottoman era they used to use hot sand for slowly cooking Turkish coffee, today's Turkish companies invented hot sand machines, but do NOT buy them too, they also cook Turkish coffee faster. Turkish coffee is coffee SOUP made from coffee flour, like cooking soup, you must cook it slowly.
3-Do NOT boil it, please do NOT! when the crema/foam starts to swell, pour it on the cup, do NOT wait any microsecond when you see the foam/cream started to swell.
4-It is optional, but for me cooking for one person/one cup always results too much better. Buy one cup version of Jezve.
5-Sugar. I drink Turkish coffee without sugar(I am diabetic) but It is obvious Turkish coffee results better with adding sugar, because sugar increases foam/crema's size and changes foam/creama's color from dark brown to caramel color.

ROAST:
Use everytime medium roasted beans. Dark roasted results very bitter.

GRIND SIZE:
There are two Turkish coffee grind size;
1-Machine Grind size, all of Turkish coffees in packages.
2-Aegean Region Dibek Kahvesi(Mortar Coffee) Grind Size: It is not same Dibek Kahvesi of central and eastern Turkey. It is regular Turkish coffee but a little bit coarser grind size. They grind coffee in a mortar, not in a machine, and It results a little bit coarser coffee. I think It is the most delicious coffee in Turkey. But finding it is very hard especially if you are outside of Turkey, I have not tried but maybe you can grind same size with a grinder.

My Recipe for One Person/One Cup

-Put 2 teaspoon Turkish coffee in Jezve. 1 teaspoon results very light, 3 teaspoon results bitter.
-Put Sugar.
-Pour water in your Turkish coffee cup and pour 1/3 water of the cup in Jezve.
-Stir until all of sugar dissolve and pour remaining water in your cup in Jezve. Stir it a little bit.
-Put your Jezve on low heat/flame stove, It is the rule, lower is the heat, better is the result.
-Wait and see your coffee, do not stir or any thing, just observe.
-You can see foam/crema. Just wait a little bit.
-When you see the foam crema has started to swell  pour your coffee immidiately.

Tips:
-If you do not wait the crema/foam started to swell, your coffee gets uncooked/raw, but If you do not pour it when you see the foam/crema has started to swell, it it gets bitter and boiled.

1ngyq33,https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/tuscan-coffee-cake-recipe,"Adding soaked fruit to dough, help confirming what went wrong!","I’m making a yeasted coffee cake (recipe attached), and I decided to soak the fruit in brandy (because it’s brandy, yum). I’m pretty inexperienced with yeasted bakes and breads in general but I thought since this is a cake-bread hybrid it could work. I soak fruit for all my other bakes (scones, muffins, etc). I dumped the fruit out of the soaking bowl and squeezed in a paper towel twice to remove excess liquid (or so I thought).

The recipe has you make an overnight starter, then make an enriched dough with a first rise. After that, it instructs to gently deflate and mix/knead in the walnuts and dried fruit. As soon as my fruit went in, the gluten started tearing and breaking down into a shaggy mess. I tried to flour my congee and then knead there to absorb moisture for a bit, then fold as much as I could but it was still pretty torn up and shredded. It’s in its final rise now and I’ll bake it anyway. 

I think I might have gone wrong when I tried to squeeze the fruit dry. I’m guessing I should have laid them flat on a paper towel and done it that way to make sure each piece wasn’t wet (vs squeezing a ball of fruit where the middle stayed wet). 

My questions are this: should I have used less brandy? Dried the fruit better? Or simply avoiding using soaked fruit? The recipe doesn’t call for laying the dough flat to add the inclusions, just to gently deflate the dough and then mix/knead in. Is this an unspoken given in a recipe, where it’s implied I should pour the dough onto the counter from the bowl and flatten and then add gently? Should I have only folded rather than kneaded? 

Any insight or thoughts appreciated. I love baking but yeast things and breads are my downfall. I never seem to get them quite right and seem to perpetually overproof. The finger test hasn’t worked for this particular recipe at all thus far. I’ve only been able to nail brioche and rolls, lol. Please help a novice baker! ",1,1757874186.0,AskBaking,1,1.0,False

I was counting the usual glacial, indifferent stares of uninterested gawkers watching street musicians performing some flamenco in the park. Sitting next to them, I was enjoying the mild wind of September and thought, *""ah, that could be a cover of Gustavo Santaolalla,""* and closed my eyes for a bit. It was about two weeks ago.

Earlier, on an ugly morning before hitting Ritterstrasse, I wanted to sip a coffee at ""Rock, Paper..."" and I noticed a really beautiful girl sitting there, having just her own peaceful time, unbothered. She was casually smiling and speaking Italian or French to the waitress, and they were exchanging warm smiles that kind of improved my bad day. Shortly after, I accidentally had a random unspoken encounter when we both were at the counter ordering a drink. (no creepy thoughts, no xD).

So, fast forward to the park, she came to the same place as me and I was wondering: *""ah, but this is the same girl I saw earlier? Wtf, what are the chances in Berlin to meet the same stranger twice in the same day""* And I thought that was awesome, just by that fact. Her presence was comforting even without the slightest interaction, and she was just there painting the tree in front of Böcklerpark.

When she left, she respectfully and smiley nodded to say goodbye to me, and she actually turned her head specifically to say goodbye to me... Like, she could have done that with many other people sitting just next to me, and me, like a fcktard, I wasn’t able to come up with even the slightest freaking phoneme. Like I could have said, *""I noticed you were painting. It was really beautiful...""* but no. I badly wanted to get to know her better.

He was about to turn 69 years old. I found him at home on the bathroom floor on Saturday. He had just had a check-up at the cardiovascular office on Thursday (1day prior), and they checked him and he was doing great, they said.  The state med examiner refused an autopsy because they said no foul play and deemed it natural causes because he had high blood pressure and high cholesterol, but it's leaving me with so many questions…



He had just had open heart surgery on August 7th 2025 to have his aortic valve replaced with a pig valve. About 1.5 years ago, his primary noticed the murmur. He then went to a specialist to find out he has a leaking aortic valve that he was born with, and the doctor said it's congenital. His primary told him he seemed overall fit and healthy, and to push the date since he didn’t have any symptoms. He did start to eventually have symptoms of feeling fatigued and not having as much energy as he used to. The surgeon urged him to have the surgery soon, and so it was scheduled. 



Immediately following surgery, the surgeon said there were no surprises and he did fine. He was discharged 3.5 days later. Seemed to be doing totally fine, and then towards the end of the month, he said he was feeling his best yet. His check-up on Thursday went well. I found him saturday night on the bathroom floor. He had his phone in his hand. 

Prior to surgery they said he had an overall very healthy heart and healthy veins. 



* The arterys around his heart prior to surgery to make sure there were no blockages -the  test came back that his arteries were normal.
* The cat scan he had done to check the aorta and it came back normal, saying the risk of dissection was very very low. 
* The echocardiogram was done after surgery looked good
* Chest xrays looked good no abnormal findings. 
* In his postoperative notes he had “coffee grounds vomit” denoting possible blood he was coughing up, on post op day,  but they started therapy on that, and his blood count came back low normal upon discharge.
* Other than that he was ok.



During his thursday physical exam she checked his heart and lungs, vital signs, blood pressure, heart rate were all normal range. His incision site on his chest was clean. It was all normal.



Its heartbreaking and leaves up wondering what happened. They said this is super rare. It so frustrating. If anyone had any encouraging words, something similar would love to hear from anyone.

I feel like everything is my fault in my life since i was born, i don't know truly if i have a neurological condition or not, but i just feel so lonely in a suffering that i do not know if i'm just lazy or forgetful or what's going on.

Since i was a kid i was very hyperactive to the point of my mom feeding me enormous amounts of food so i couldn't be able to even run or walk and would just calm down to digest everything, i started having heavy trouble with school around 11 years old in Secondary school, i inmediately started repeating all my years, i always wanted to study but i just couldn't ever concentrate, i always sucked at math heavily to the point that teachers would just say that it's impossible to teach me, the rest of things i would just fail most of my stuff and had to cheat in lots of exams, not because i wanted but because the situation for me was critical, i was getting very depressed, i had always problems making friends with other guys, i just couldn't never fit with them, i was very shy and akward and i felt i had to mimick what they found normal because i never understood how do people worked like, apart that i always had problems that i would be when i got very excited (and still do) flapping my hands, arms and swinging my back while moving myself, so people was weirded out and i never knew what to do no matter how hard i tried, so i would just stay alone most of the time.

Teachers would just tell my parents that i was a failure and to just put me in one of those classes where they would just put any student with very bad notes to make them study something to work.

Which is what happened, and well it was easier, because directly the exams where directly with our notebook (i was in shock and felt a bit insulted but i trought that if adults put me in there it meant that truly i was where i was suppossed to be and just simply accepted my situation).

I had troubles but i got with hard work a 5 thanks to homeworks in certain things, and i had troubles when they put me for the first time working for 1 month it was a horrible experience, i started feeling very depressed, i studied informatics and i was in a random company washing vomited baby toys, and because i was very forgetfull and clumsy i would constantly get electrocuted by things, because i couldn't pay attention well because i always felt a fog that wouldn't make me react to anything so i couldn't never really react til i got electrocuted by broken cables.

My boss was constantly pressuring me and treating me horribly, which i ended up snapping with anger towards him after one month no matter how much i tried, and i failed, but my aunt saved me and did the work placement in her place.

And then i got into pharmacy because i had a very bad image of what i studied and wanted to change, i went there and my teachers told me before leaving that i do not deserve my title and that i would not pass my studies further than this.

I got in pharmacy and well i started noticing heavy problems with myself, i was very hyperactive, i couldn't stop talking, moving really fast, had an intense feeling like hunger but with wanting to run really fast, and because i knew this was very important i did all i could to focus, but i just couldn't focus in a class because i get inmediately distracted or i have million of troughts in my mind and my mind the only thing was doing was constantly jumping to things that would make others laugh and i couldn't control myself no matter what, i would spin constantly in my seat to the point of the teacher telling me to please stop or to go for a walk.

I noticed that now i was in a place very confusing to me, some girls would just start pressuring me into doing things i didn't want to do, i would get harassed just because they found me pretty, i felt very sad and anxious because teachers would just say ""Well there's not a lot of boys in here haha!"" and this girls would constantly try to make me do something so they could use it against me, or give me constantly mean looks despite not doing anything to them, at first they were kind and i was kind back but suddenly they flipped and started harassing me for 2 years (that lasted my years there) even in the supermarket i wasn't safe and some of them would just stare to make me umcomfortable or scream saying that i was a weirdo who doesn't behave like they expected me to behave.

Everything feels so intense, i'm like a sponge that absorbs everything, and feeling this level of social rejection was too much that it lead me to go to school scared or very anxious, even outside of school i felt like everyone around me on the street where looking at me like if i was a horrible creature.

I felt constantly like in a zoo, they would everyday stare at me like if i was an animal in a glass.

I felt very depressed when even girls i never did anything to and even gave stuff to them treated me horribly and spoke very bad behind my back giving me homophobic insults.

I contantly struggled with notes, feeling constantly anxious and trying multiple methods because i couldn't focus in class, brown noise, headphones, absolutely everything with no result.

Somehow i managed to pass both years with 5s and 6s, but when i came to my work placement i got in a pharmacy, i had to compensate being bad remembering stuff with working very very hard, i wasn't paid because it's considered studies not actual work contract, i would go even days where it wasn't lective because my boss would lure me with advantages, and because that boss kept pressuring me to do things and i just couldn't fanthom loosing all my progress that i did in 2 years i acceded to everything he told me, i would do even mundane things like unpacking amazon packages for his daughter, and every day he would shout at me saying that i had no friends because i wasn't extraverted like him and i just simply said that i'm trying all i can, i would take 4 buses in one day to go there, every bus would take like 40 mins, and the bus in the morning would always let me 40 mins before even the pharmacy opened, i tried to do everything, absolutely everything so i could pass but it wasn't enough no matter how much i worked, it was like i couldn't ever reach what he wanted out of me, i came from devastated, knowing the day would repeat over and over, the only thing i could do was pray so i wouldn't break in any moment, when i was constantly being pressured i felt like the people in there paid extra attention if i would break down and when i never did they would just do like nothing happened, it was sickening like if they were doing it in purpose, or maybe it's just my pain making me believe that.

I also had racist comments by people who came by and it wasn't a nice neighbourhood in general, being very tall was also a problem, people would just stare at me for multiple reasons apart from it too or inmediately distrust me because i'm 20.

I ended up failing once again my work placement, had a rough month after i failed it, thinking how the director of the old school center told my dad that i would never amount to nothing and spread lots of lies about me despite not knowing me.

I started trying to save myself learning something, but of course i never can concentrate so everything was useless, i tried to think positive but i just couldn't when it felt like i was being part of a prophecy where i would never amount to anything.

My dad one day where he saw me very depressed in my bed rotting, i couldn't even drink water or do basic tasks told me if i wanted a coffee, something that i never take because i disliked very young the taste, but i trought ""Well fine i guess"" and when i took it 20 mins later i started feeling weird, suddenly i stopped feeling a fog in my mind, suddenly i could stand up and do things, it was like suddenly i saw the light, i couldn't understand what was happening, i suddenly started doing my hobbies again, i was so happy and i couldn't understand what was happening to me, i felt suddenly happy and my anxiety dissappeared, i was suddenly quite social and i spoke with my dad, and for once i wasn't interrupting or zoning out but i was listening and giving my opinion on things and he told me ""You're too normal today, are you ok?""

And i couldn't understand either what was happening to me it was the best day of my life, i did so many things, i could clean my bedroom, i even cleaned the house, i even focused on people instead of just myself, everyday since then i remember that beatiful day. when i tried the next day NOTHING happened and i was sad nothing happened, and i tried buying things like L theanine, L tyrosine, or anything, and absolutely nothing, i tried taking higher doses, and i took once like 4 cups of caffeine, and i knew the consequences, i would get very bad effects, but i wanted to feel as alive as that day, so i took it, and instead of feeling anything bad or good, i felt after 15 mins very sleepy, so sleepy that i randomly slept almost 3 hours.

i constanly try to drink caffeine, i want to be like that day, why can others just do stuff just because they wanna? i feel like there's a magic wall blocking my movements, if i wanna hangout with my sister to watch a movie i cannot, my body doesn't let me move from my bed, or even hydrate myself sometimes, i even get anxious because i cannot move.

I try to do stuff like use my headphones with really loud music with rythm and it lets me clean stuff at least but now i'm getting used to it because i have some music that my brain liked but now it got used and not it doesn't work.

Sometimes i can't even eat certain dishes, if i eat similar my body even if i want to eat it, it doesn't let me eat it no matter what, i feel like a brat but i feel like if the taste isn't exactly how my brain likes it or if it feels similar to what i ate before in certain period of time my brain doesn't let me eat it no matter what, i try to paliate mixing new ingredients but my brain constantly needs innovation or else it won't let me eat it, i try to mix the new thing with the old thing so i can at least eat the max amount possible.

I feel like there's something really wrong with me, i just cannot deal with what society expects me to do and i just can't no matter how much i work or study, it feels like everything is done to make be homeless, i do not know what's wrong with me or why is my life like this, i cannot ever win fully.

I see my friends and they progress meanwhile i'm just stuck, constantly since i was in Secondary school, everyone progresses in life except me, and i just do not understand why everyone has it so easy for studies and working.

My dad constantly disqualifies what i feel and everything and say either ""Well it's something normal that happens in our bloodline, i do have things like that and your grandfather even ended up taking illegal drugs to pass the medicine career, it's not a big of a deal look at me i got a job at the end.""

I just feel like i'm constantly seeing like an unproductive member of society and that i'm just searching for excuses, i try to stay rational but when everyone around me treats me like my problems aren't important to deal with i just don't know what to do.

So please strangers of the internet, i would like to know what you guys think of my life story, thanks for reading me and i would kindly appreciate comments.",3,1757873565.0,selfhelp,1,1.0,False
