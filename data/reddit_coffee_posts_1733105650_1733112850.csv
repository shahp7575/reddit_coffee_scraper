1h4mf63,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXPreppers/comments/1h4mf63/live_on_old_farmland_or_considering_buying_land/,Live on old farmland or considering buying land to homestead or prep? PFAS test your soil!!,"**If you are contemplating homesteading on land that has been farmed (or is in a historically farmed runoff zone) any time in the last sixty years, you really need to get PFAS tests done on that soil.** 

The background: Scientists invented Teflon in the 1930s, and for 80 years waterproofing chemicals have made life a lot easier and safer for humans. This is not an anti-PFAS post, especially for firefighters and other industries where they have saved thousands of lives.

The problem is that PFAS and other waterproofing chemicals were and are also used in all kinds of consumer goods that are otherwise porous in order to make them greaseproof - if you've ever used a paper plate or bought takeout, you've bought PFAS. 

It was not known until pretty recently that PFAS is incredibly good at bioaccumulating - that is, because it degrades very slowly, the amount a worm absorbs is passed along to the shrew that eats the worm, and the amount that the shrew absorbs from eating a hundred worms is passed along to the owl that eats the shrew, and so on. This bioaccumulation is presenting a real danger to humans, because we're apex consumers and live a long time. We don't eat worms, but we do eat non-stick coating in tiny amounts all the time. The amount of PFAS on a paper plate is not dangerous. The amount on ten thousand paper plates and ten thousand forks and three million sips of coffee from paper cups might be. Because of this constant exposure, pretty much all of us poop PFAS and pee PFAS and shed it in our skin cells and on and on it goes.

There are a lot of agencies working hard to figure out how to quantify and lessen this risk, so don't get panicky about your cups just yet - what you need to know is how this phenomenon affects the soil.

What a lot of people who are contemplating homesteading don't know is that for decades, industry and waste treatment have looked to farmers to absorb biodegradable waste products, many many thousands of tons of them. Paper pulp factories offer their sludge at cheap or free rates to amend soil. Municipalities give out or sell sterilized biomass from water treatment. There are dozens of examples of biodegradable waste being used to minimize what goes into landfills, and it has been a win for farmers as well. Paper pulp is incredibly good as a soil amendment; human biosolids are super nutritious for plants. 

This cycle has been going on for at least sixty years. SIXTY. If you've been connecting these dots, you may now realize that I'm saying that PFAS-containing material has been spread, repeatedly and thickly and eagerly, on a huge percentage of American farmland. 

Maine is the furthest ahead in the science and testing, because Maine is a huge paper-producing state and started testing land several years ago. They were absolutely horrified to find that the situation is already very dire, with at least a quarter of the tested groundwater sites showing contamination with PFAS and hundreds of farms testing high. But Maine is not special - except that they have done the most testing. It's very likely that many states will have the same level of contamination. 

It is NOT WORTH guessing or hoping that a piece of land you're looking at, or already living on, is clear of PFAS. If there is any history of farming on or near it, spend the money and get it looked at.

1h4meab,https://www.reddit.com/r/robotech/comments/1h4meab/just_some_thoughts_from_rewatch_of_the_new/,Just some thoughts from rewatch of The New Generation,"After a recent post on my thoughts from a rewatch of [The Macross Saga](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotech/comments/1g026g6/just_some_thoughts_from_rewatch_of_the_macross/), followed by a post on [The Masters](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotech/comments/1ghkjb4/just_some_thoughts_from_rewatch_of_the_masters/), here I am again, to conclude my trilogy of long-form, stream-of-consciousness thoughts, this time on The New Generation. I'm not calling this a *review*, because I don't think I have the credentials to review anything. I'm just some guy who likes writing (God knows, redditors have let me know that I write a lot), and I find a creative outlet putting my thoughts into words. r/robotech, in particular, has been fun to post to, because the community has been welcoming of my sharing my thoughts in this format, and I've had some fun, friendly banter with commenters in response.

Warnings:

1. Spoilers aplenty!
2. This post will mightily irritate you if you don't like long reads!
3. This is stream-of-consciousness. I tried a bit to organize thoughts roughly in episode order, but there's plenty that's just spur-of-the-moment commentary, and in no particular order.

My rewatch started on a whim: merely because I saw someone had uploaded the entire Robotech series to YouTube. After watching the first few episodes noncommittally, I soon found myself hooked, looking forward to my nightly episode or two. Many things date the show, but broadly, in terms of its story and character arcs, it's aged well. I first found myself pulled in by the cool transforming mecha, and exciting battle sequences. Then I found myself invested in the interpersonal drama, and intrigued by the alien Zentraedi culture, and the larger mythos.

Watching The Masters became a slog pretty early on, especially after the great Macross Saga. The last few episodes, that crammed a lot of mythos into a short window, became more interesting. But I was good and done with The Masters when it concluded, and left with a feeling of mild irritation. But I still thought The Masters earned some redemption in the last handful of episodes, when it started focusing on the mythos. Even here, though, the show shot itself in its foot with inconsistent explanations of protoculture.

I have recollection, though, from my very first watch of Robotech when I was 8 - 10ish years old, that I liked The New Generation a bit more than The Masters, though still not as much as The Macross Saga. Still, I went in with an open mind, mostly wanting to cleanse my palate from The Masters.

Right off the bat, it's instantly recognizable that Scott's fiancé, Marlene, is the same voice as Lisa Hayes. Similarly, Rand was obviously the same voice as Rick Hunter. Was this in response to fans' lukewarm reception of The Masters, in an attempt to trigger emotional callbacks to The Macross Saga through those instantly-recognizable voices?

Killing off Marlene, and Scott's immediate crew right in the first episode felt *bold*. I thought the disintegration/destruction of their ship was ambiguous, so all the way to the end of that first episode, I was expecting a reveal that Marlene and crew had survived. I felt a twinge of actual sadness that their deaths actually stuck. But that speaks to the writers' conviction of telling *mature* stories through the medium of cartoon/anime. It added some depth to the character of Scott Bernard, and was a quick way to foster empathy for him.

The transforming mecha are cool again after being a bit disappointing in The Masters. I've always felt that the F-14 Tomcat and F-15 Eagle were sort of ""peak cool"" among fighter jets, maybe partly from their representation in iconic pop-culture touchstones like ""Top Gun"" and ""Transformers,"" during that 80s/Reagan era when Hollywood was pumping out steroidally-high levels of American patriotism that also fetishized the badassery of American military technology. The Macross Saga's Veritech fighters, seemingly modeled on the F-14 Tomcat, inherits the coolness/badassness made iconic by Hollywood output of that era. The Alpha Fighter, from The New Generation, to my untrained eye, appears to be loosely modeled on a mishmash of elements of the era's fighter jets...so it also inherits the coolness from the general shape/aesthetic of those aircraft, although perhaps a bit more abstractly than The Macross Saga's Veritech fighters. Robot mode, too, is cool, but again, not quite as iconic as The Macross Saga's Veritech fighters' robot mode, but an improvement on the somewhat insipid robot-mode mecha from The Masters.

From my childhood viewing of The New Generation, I had this feeling of being unclear who the ""main"" or ""point of view"" character was meant to be. One might initially think that it is Scott Bernard, since he's clearly the point-of-view character of the first episode, where you typically establish these foundational sorts of things. But, as the episodes progress, I felt that Scott seemed to be framed as a rather *bland* character. He's a very serious, upstanding, do-gooder kind of guy, perhaps a little too blindly loyal to the military -- nothing bad about any of that per se. I can't help but make comparison to Ultra Magnus from the great *Transformers: The Movie*, of that same era: Ultra Magnus is also a *good guy*, dedicated to the cause, upright, and a no-nonsense, get-the-job-done kind of guy. But he's lacking a certain *charisma* or personality or quirk or uniqueness that would make him a compelling main character. That's how I felt about Scott: a stand-up guy, that we empathized with from the very first episode because of his loss, but lacking that personality/charisma to make him a compelling main character. In my first post on The Macross Saga, a commenter pointed out that Rick Hunter is somewhat a dick to others. I hate to think this out loud, but I wonder if that *little bit* of asshole in a character -- as long as it doesn't go past a certain limit -- isn't what *makes* a character compelling? As a real-life analogy: there is the widespread perception that women ""go for the bad boy"" over the nice guys (kudos to those with the discernment to go for the nice guys, though 😃). I think, similarly, it's the reason why we accept characters like Walter White, or Tony Soprano, as compelling *point-of-view* characters, if not *protagonists*, per se. So it goes with poor Scott Bernard: a good guy, no doubt, just lacking that certain *panache* to his character that compelled my recognizing of him as the ""main"" character. What about Rand? As a Rick Hunter sound-alike, and definitely possessing a loudmouth/brash quality about him, perhaps he was our main character? I dunno...without a background in creative arts, I can't speak in technical terms, but I thought the way he was ""framed""...he seemed clearly a supporting character. He didn't have enough ""presence"" to be the main character. I thought he bordered on comic sidekick. The same with Rook: I think her backstory (from reading the Robotech wiki) gave her the potential to be a compelling main character, but the way she was ""framed"" in The New Generation, made her squarely a supporting character. As a result, I personally felt left without a truly compelling main/point-of-view character.

I think you can successfully pull off stories without a specific point-of-view character; an easy example of this is A Game of Thrones, where there are many point-of-view characters, some of whom vacillate between protagonist and antagonist. Why was Game of Thrones more successful in pulling this off than A New Generation? Perhaps it was some combination of the self-seriousness of the show, the amount of time we had getting to know the various point-of-view characters, and more polished/mature writing. I could make a comparison between Scott Bernard and Jon Snow: both are serious, somewhat dour, get-the-job-done characters...why was Jon Snow more successful as a point-of-view character than Scott Bernard? I think it had something to do with the the fact that we were shown *why* he was dour, but also, *that* he had depth and complexity and fire and emotions that *actively buried* because of his desire to find honor in a society where (the false narrative of) he was denied certain rights and privileges because of his being a bastard. We had no such deep-dive into the psychology of Scott Bernard. The initial loss of Marlene made us *empathize* with him, but I don't think we had the follow-through deep dive into his psychology. Obviously, it's unfair to compare an 80s era anime to one of the peaks of modern ""prestige TV,"" I merely bring this up to wonder out loud what makes for a ""successful"" multiple-point-of-view-character show versus an attempt that doesn't quite land.

From my childhood watch, I superficially remembered Annie LaBelle as a kid with an ""ET"" hat, always on the hunt for a boyfriend. Now that I'm older, I was wary of her because kids in ""serious"" shows are often the weak link: either because of underdeveloped acting ability, or because ""childish"" behavior like crying or being scared or whiny just comes across as annoying more than endearing. Mostly, I would say that Annie did *not* come across as annoying. Her ""man-hungry"" personality actually made her quirky in an endearing kind of way. We often laugh away, or consider it ""cute,"" or chalk it up to play-acting when a child acts out adult traits or behaviors, e.g. Annie acting ""man-crazy."" But in Episode 11, ""The Secret Route,"" that became ***awkward*** because the supporting character Eddie, who was either a young adult, or a mid/older teen seemed to *reciprocate* that flirting! The two were hanging out together an awful lot, sitting in the back of a truck together...I felt quite a bit uncomfortable with their relationship in that episode.

""The Secret Route"" also raised the question: w*hat exactly was the group's relationship with Annie*? Did the adults consider themselves Annie's guardians? That certainly was implied by her being an orphan/on her own, and kind of ""adopted"" into the group. But then, *how on earth* could they be so nonchalant about Annie deciding to pack up and leave with another family/group that they barely knew? Not to mention that the primary reason why Annie wanted to move in with that new group was because of her flirting with teen/young adult Eddie! That whole affair was just awkward.

I appreciated that Annie was *mostly* not used as the stereotypical annoying/whining/crying kid character. *But*, unfortunately, in Episode 12, ""The Fortress,"" Annie *was* used as the clumsy/goofy/pratfall type character at the worst of times: when she and Rand were infiltrating an Invid base. This was the annoying TV/movie trope: the clumsy/goofy sidekick character who goofs up, stumbles, or makes an ill-timed sound, etc. in the middle of some serious activity (*cough, cough...Jar Jar Binks...cough, cough*).

Perhaps I should address the elephant in the room: Lancer/Yellow Dancer. I honestly do not have any memory of this cross-dressing character from my initial childhood viewing. The first time this is addressed, it's played as a *very* risque moment. Yellow Dancer -- presented as female up until that point -- starts to undress; we even see a glimpse of bra. The men in the group are torn between looking and not looking, caught between embarrassment and arousal. Then suddenly: upper frontal nudity...only -- *gasp!* \-- its *chest* and not *breasts!* I was right there with Rand embarrassedly hoping to see boobies.  
I have no memory of this scene, or Lancer's cross-dressing nature from my boyhood viewing of the show...could it have been edited out for TV? The 80s were a different, more conservative era, and even if Minmei's butt made it past censors of the era, I think an openly cross-dressing character might have been a bridge too far.  
I suppose this is a sensitive topic. Over time, we've generally become more accepting of people's proclivities and non-conformities. But it'd be naïve to pretend that this isn't a hot-button political issue these days. I am generally a live-and-let-live kind of guy, so honestly, after the initial shock of realizing that Lancer was a cross-dressing man, although a part of me couldn't help but go, ""hmm..."" every time he dressed up as Yellow Dancer, mostly I just accepted it.  
But I do think this warrants at least a little discussion, because it'd be naïve to pretend this didn't push the envelope of what could be shown in 80s-era Saturday morning cartoons. The writers no doubt knew they were portraying something unconventional for children's TV, even for Japan's social mores on sex and nudity, which are different than in Western countries. I have to wonder what the writers' intent was with this character: did they have a sincere desire to try to bring awareness, or reduce social biases against men who cross-dress? Were they trying to be pioneers at shining a spotlight on the cross-dressing segment of society? I can't tell: on the one hand, there was the big initial buildup of the reveal, played partly for sexuality, partly for comedy, but subsequently, Lancer went in-and-out of character as Yellow Dancer, like it was no big deal. Perhaps that *was* the intent: make the initial presentation shocking -- after all, there is no denying that it was *unconventional* to openly be a cross-dresser in that era and genre -- but thereafter treat it as though it is no big deal.  
All this makes me wonder where *we* will go as a society in the future: will we become truly *accepting* of every individual's *individuality* and nonconformity to ""traditional"" gender/class/racial/etc. expectations? Or will circumstances lead to a renewed conformance to traditional mores? Do these mores exist because they reveal something inherent and immutable us, or are they strictly social constructs that warrant being broken?

On a somewhat related topic, let me mention Invid Marlene's full frontal nudity. I've said this in one way or another in my first two posts, and I'll try to say it again, as straightforward as possible without being crass: I *enjoy* the female form, I think it's objectively beautiful, and, frankly, titillating, arousing, etc., qualities that can be heightened or enhanced in artistic media like anime. Nudity will obviously always cause a reflexive sexual thrill, and I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with that - I don't believe in prudishly censoring nudity, or pretending that sexuality doesn't exist, but I can ponder its narrative legitimacy. I only recently watched House of the Dragon season 2, where I finally saw the much-talked-about scene of full-frontal male nudity from the character Aemond Targaryen, and I had no problem with it because in-universe, in-context, and in-character, that scene was completely justifiable. But it was also surely a sexual thrill to some viewers. That was a long-winded prelude to discussing Invid Marlene's full frontally nudity. I mean, *we see everything*. And yes, it's titillating. But I can't help but feel her nudity was an unnecessary attempt to echo the cheesecake moments from Robotech's prior chapters: Minmei's bare butt in a shower scene, Lisa Hayes' unbuttoning her top, and Dana Sterling's showing us her butt and breasts every other episode. On the other hand, I could also see the argument that Invid Marlene is so emotionally innocent (by being an Invid construct, she doesn't carry the baggage of human social mores), that she doesn't think twice about the ""childish"" or ""innocent"" act of stripping naked to jump in a lake in front of onlookers. Because this is the *third* chapter where we see out-of-the-blue female nudity, I wonder whether it's crossed the line between pleasantly surprising nudity and nudity for the sake of appealing to prurient interest. In fairness: one could make the same commentary about nudity in the prior chapters. Ultimately, the artistic depiction of nudity will always have an aspect of sexual thrill and titillation to it - you can't get around that; I think all I'm trying to say is: good art can also make it narratively relevant. In the case of The New Generation, I couldn't help but feel that Invid Marlene's nudity was included only because The Macross Saga and The Masters did it, and they wanted to ""echo"" that in this chapter.

All that said, Invid Marlene is hot.

I always liked the depiction of the *alienness* of the alien societies. But I feel that the Invid culture was not explored as thoroughly as that of the Zentraedi and Robotech Masters. In The Macross Saga, there was the uncanny dichotomy of the Zentraedi being physically (and genetically) human, but with ""alien"" voice modulation and an alien society ignorant of mignling sexes, peace, music, and love. In The Masters, that dichotomy between people who were physically identifiably human, and their creepily-modulated voices and radically different society was well-used to portray their *alienness*. In The New Generation, the Invid are just outright physically different from humans. The crablike form of their troopers is enjoyably creepy, and ""alien"" to behold. It inspires wonder what they might ""natively"" look like under their mecha. But there is no inspection of their culture, so there is not that physical/societal dichotomy, which is a bit of a shame. From childhood, I have memories of weird/fascinating dialog between the Invid Regent and Regis...I wonder if these could have been in those handful of episodes that weren't correctly uploaded at the YouTube playlist, *or* if I'm mixing up memories from one of the sequel Robotech media. I have a vague understanding that there were Robotech sequel works that chopped-and-diced from the original series, and remixed it into a hybrid, mutant continuity. That's another pet peeve of mine: retconning/reimagining/rebooting/multiverses...which is why I've checked out of a lot of modern Hollywood output...but that's another rant for another subreddit. 😛

A standout episode for me was ""Ghost Town."" It starts out dismally: with a cowboy/western trope. Shows of that era often had ""themed episodes,"" which might be 60s/hippie, or cowboy/western, or King Arthur/Knights of the Round Table, etc., something incongruous to the usual tone or genre of the show. The start of this episode gave me every sign this was going to be one of those cheesy ""themed episodes."" But it took a tangent, and told a surprisingly moving tale about old/retired soldiers, who'd grown tired/jaded/cynical about war, but were roused to make one final stand for a rediscovered sense of self and duty. I did not expect it to be as moving as it was. The old soldiers have turned mercenary, selling scavenged/stolen equipment, concerned only for the highest bidder. One of the old soldiers, Gabby, was obsessed with a radio receiver (a transceiver with an irreparable transmitter) that receives transmissions from Rick Hunter's Expeditionary Force (I thought it was a bit contrived how they tried to shoehorn a connection to The Macross Saga, but oh well). Over the course of the episode, it's revealed that the face/voice of the transmissions is Gabby's son, and the last transmission that Gabby receives is his son relaying the REF's request for remaining resistance fighters to mount an attack on Invid bases. Gabby, ever a faithful soldier at heart, mounted what he must have known would be a suicide mission. As a dad myself, that notion of a father receiving communications from his long-separated son, unable to respond, then going off to die in response to the last communication he'll ever receive from his son...man, that hit me straight in the heart. What an emotional gut punch. How the hell did something that deep make it into an 80s-era Saturday morning cartoon? The amazing thing was: this mini-masterpiece of writing was just a minor subplot in the larger episode. Gabby's last charge, and the resolve of Scott & gang revived a sense of duty in the remaining old soldiers, who dusted off their salvaged cruiser for one last charge at their enemy. Battle-damage dooming them to an inevitable fate, they decided to ram their cruiser into their target, and unleash fury in the form of a suicidal close-range missile dump. A running gag through the episode was that one of the retired soldiers, nicknamed Shorty couldn't remember his real name, and hated his nickname. Right as the missiles were being unleashed, his last words were, ""It's a funny thing...I just remembered what it really is; my name, it's..."" then fade to oblivion. I found the dominant themes to be PTSD, and disillusionment about war from those who've actually fought, the cynicism that replaces patriotism/honor/duty, especially if you've realized unpleasant realities like war being a for-profit endeavor, often waged for the personal vainglory of oligarchs and politicians, while the soldiers themselves are nameless pawns on the chessboard of the rich and powerful. The fact that the Robotech war is a fight for humanity's survival against aliens perhaps muddies that message, but I understand the writers' intent: a message about veterans' disillusionment with war. But importantly, this episode also showcases the theme of renewed purpose. I think that speaks across time to this day and age...I just posted a little spiel over at r/batman about why I empathized with Arthur Fleck's Joker...I wrote about how the times we live in seems to oppress our collective sense of hope: we seem to live in times of bitterness, acrimony, sniping at each other across our various mass communication technologies while the wealth gap increasingly widens, making it easier to be dour about our collective future. In this atmosphere, can we find a renewed sense of purpose? Will some great fight, some great cause, inspire us to a passionate last stand? ""Ghost Town"" depicts all these heady themes in a subplot of a 30-minute cartoon! I found parallels to the much-lauded episode ""The Tales of Ba Sing Se"" from the late, great ""Avatar: The Last Airbender."" In that episode, we follow a character (Uncle Iroh), who up until that point, had largely been portrayed as laid-back, easygoing, mellow, and bordering-on-buffoonish. He goes about his day, doing laid-back, easygoing, mellow, bordering-on-buffoonish things, seemingly preparing for a picnic with a potential love interest. At the conclusion of his adventures, though, we see that he had actually been preparing for a memorial for his son, a war casualty under his own command. It's been widely memed that that episode has caused grown men to cry. The abrupt reminder that you can't judge a book by its cover, that you can't necessarily judge a man by his outward disposition, that even clownish or crass or insufferable people might secretly, silently be carrying emotional scars, can bring a grown man to a sudden stop for contemplation and reflection. I felt exactly this from watching the final acts of bravery of the retired soldiers in ""Ghost Town.""

On a total 180, tonally, the very next episode, ""Hired Gun,"" had a moment of unintentional comedy I just *have* to comment on. In this episode, Rook develops a crush on a *mysterious stranger* named Dusty Ayres. Rook is the only one able to see through to this character's past trauma and his humanity. To all others, he has been framed as a murderous outlaw. There's a scene where, as Dusty is about to ride off, Rook coyly mentions, ""You know, you never did tell me your name..."" to which Dusty replies, ""That's okay.""  
The *comedy* of the moment is hard to convey in text, but it has to do with the stilted dialogue: Rook and Dusty are cringingly flirting, trying to cram a lot of character development into a short amount of time, which comes across as the comedic [anime-speak famously parodied by Family Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq1-12WSjp0). And I couldn't tell you why, but watching that scene, I couldn't help but view this as an unintentionally comedic parallel to [Han and Leia's famous farewell from The Empire Strikes Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdlRmWd_R7A).  
The comedy also comes from the delivery of these lines...it's as though there was no rehearsal, and the two voice actors are interpreting the scene in completely different ways...in response to Rook's obvious flirting, Dusty delivers his response, ""That's okay,"" with all the emotion of politely forgiving a barista for serving him the wrong coffee order.

I should note here that [the YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QS-EUHVgFc&list=PLbnCS5gzKroCxtZGA3egtbPV8lbqZoGiM) that I'd been relying on to watch Robotech has a few seemingly critical omissions: I think I missed some mythos-relevant plot points: the introduction of the humanoid Invid characters Sera and Corg. In the episodes available at that playlist, they just sorta show up and deliver their lines as though they're well-established characters.

""The Big Apple"" is among the worst episodes in *all of television* that I have ever watched. This episode uses the New York/Broadway/theater trope. The episode starts with the recurring theme of the gang being low on protoculture, needing to resupply. This is pleasantly realistic as a recurring plot point, since it's completely plausible that a rag-tag gang of rebels with leftover and scavenged military equipment would need to scrap about to resupply since they don't have the luxury of a fully-functional military-industrial complex behind them. But the larger episode storyline is that the gang discovers a surprisingly well-organized gang of rogue Broadway dancers, clandestinely defying the Invid's brutal clampdown on...Broadway dancing. After the inevitable escalation of Invid brutality on the hapless New York populace, the Broadway dancers muster their resolve and *dance(!!) on Broadway(!!)* to inspire freedom fighters to fight. I mean...I know what they were trying to say...and it's nice to try portray the importance of the arts in inspiring people, especially in the midst of oppression and combat. But it all just came off as *incredibly* cheesy.

[YOU...SHALL NOT...DANCE...!!](https://preview.redd.it/ilc7mn3n1d4e1.png?width=1666&format=png&auto=webp&s=786d2e23b1e9765510a6f031f751817a4ead3f8a)

""The Big Apple"" also lazily used Annie to create tension...*let's take this 9ish-year-old kid on a stealth mission, where wits, cunning, self-control, and stealth are mission-critical skills...now watch as the kid inevitably can't control noisy outbursts and carelessly handles/drops items, generally making herself conspicuous*.  
I'm sure I come across as harsh on this episode...but this one just really hit many of my pet peeves: the irritating kid character who derails a mission because of childish behavior, and also the somewhat cringey attempt to portray the power of *dance(!!)* to inspire battle-readiness.

The ""Reflex Point"" episode itself is an interesting study in dichotomy. On the one hand, I felt completely disconnected and unattached to the A-plot of Sue Graham, military journalist. I was ready to write off the whole episode as inconsequential until the end, when Invid-Marlene bled green blood, finally revealing to herself and the others that she was indeed, an Invid construct. Invid Marlene's recoil of horror upon recognizing the reality she surely suspected but dared not believe was an earned moment of pathos, and - *finally!* \- an emotional payoff of a character/relationship that had been built slowly, steadily, and carefully over time. At first, Invid Marlene didn't make much of an impression - she didn't have a ""loud"" or memorable personality, and barely talked at all. But I think her consistent *presence*, and her sweet, kind, thoughtful, and caring demeanor subtly endears her to the viewer. There was obviously a bond forming between her and Scott, and I think most of us will generally root for ""nice people"" who find love for each other, against the odds. The pregnant silence, when everyone saw Invid Marlene's green blood, spoke louder than volumes. This moment stirred emotions in me, in the way that the best of TV/movies/books have been able to, in their finest moments. My heart genuinely felt heavy when Invid Marlene finally broke down and ran away. Also: even though I didn't really connect with the character of Sue Graham, her death at the end of the episode was handled well, and was moving. So again, this episode was quite the mixed bag: it started out absolutely inauspiciously, and ended with surprising emotional weight.

During my childhood watch of The New Generation, I remember being excited by the intermittent references to Rick Hunter and his Expeditionary Force. I thought for sure that Rick, Lisa, and the remnants of the original cast would make a cameo. What a tease that all was. As a child, I was, of course, completely oblivious to the behind-the-scenes reality of Harmony Gold splicing together unrelated shows. So the references to ""Admiral Hunter"" were always just a tease, perhaps an intentional attempt at playing to lingering fondness for The Macross Saga.

The penultimate episode was surprisingly exciting. And it had pleasantly moving moments as well. I really liked this exchange between Rand, Lancer, and Rook -- it felt *earned* after all the adventures they'd been through together:

>Rand: It's too bad: I wanted to hear Yellow Dancer perform again.

>Lacer: Don't worry, you will. In the meantime, you can always buy my records.

>Rook: They're a poor substitute for the real thing.

I was just like...*aww*...at that exchange. It was sweet. It captured the built-up camaraderie between the three. And their shared adventures - that we shared with them - added volumes of subtext to that moment of ""saying goodbye without saying goodbye.""

That moment was followed by equally earned farewells with Annie...

>Lancer: Now Annie, you gotta promise me you won't go and get married behind my back.

>Annie: (crying) I won't.

...and Lunk: his ""happy ending,"" as Rand described it, was being re-drafted into the army.  
Even Scott's salutes-as-goodbyes were moving because by now, we've spent enough time with Scott to know that he was as straight-laced, low-emotion, by-the-book of a soldier as they come, so we *know* that his salute is secretly emotional, heartfelt, and expressive *for him*, and I couldn't help but feel the endearment for him that had eluded me theretofore.

While it's true that I didn't form quite as strong a bond with them as I did with The Macross Saga's characters, I think some of that can be attributed to the primacy effect, where the first thing that you're exposed to (e.g. The Macross Saga), forms the strongest, most lasting impression. But towards the end of The New Generation, as the members of the little rag-tag crew are saying their goodbyes, the feeling of *loss* suddenly hit me, and I realized that these characters had actually, *stealthily*, endeared themselves to me.

The stakes of that all-out attack in the penultimate episode suddenly felt *real* again; I felt the possibility that main characters might actually not survive, unlike the majority of the prior several episodes, where it was mostly clear that each episode was merely ""adventure of the week"" followed by a reset of the status quo.

It was obvious to me that a romantic pair-up between Rook and Rand was plotted. I was skeptical that it would work, because I just hadn't felt that chemistry was sufficiently built up over the course of the series. Here again, though, the penultimate episode put my cynicism to the side: Rook and Rand finding their shared spark in the middle of combat felt right, and earned. If they were ever going to find and admit that romantic spark, in the heat of battle seemed the right moment to realize it.

But: I was quite unimpressed by the attempted Lancer/Sera pair-up in the final episode. I'll repeat that in the YouTube playlist that I was watching, one or a few episodes were incorrectly uploaded -- did they involve Sera's interaction with Lancer? So perhaps I missed relevant character-building interactions between those two. Regardless, there was definitely not a long or sustained establishment of their relationship. So the sudden, ""hey, let's fall in love with each other"" in the finale just felt forced, unearned, and I just didn't connect with it.

It was nice to see the gang rally into battle one last time in the finale, after their presumed final goodbyes.

The *final* final goodbyes were emotional, for sure. I felt genuine sadness at leaving these characters behind, unlike the *relief* I felt at *finally* being done with the cast of characters from The Masters, but not quite as strongly as I felt about saying goodbye to The Macross Saga characters. This must partly be because this was the third time I'd been through this, partly because I hadn't spent as much time with The New Generation gang as with The Macross Saga characters, partly the primacy effect.

Scott and Invid Marlene's farewell was sad for a couple of reasons: they had never actually explicitly stated their love - I wonder if they even recognized it. They closest they got to expressing their feelings was just longing glances and pregnant silences. And then Scott goes off to try find Rick Hunter in the depths of space, because he's determined to ever be the loyal, reliable soldier. This reminded me of a recent ""deep"" conversation with my wife, where I expressed the burden that some men feel obliged to bear: burying one's emotions, putting one's head down and soldiering ahead with the duty to provide and protect. I guess in that sense, I empathized with Scott Bernard, because perhaps I a representation of me, and many men I know: someone intentionally stoic and emotionally impenetrable for fear that it'll compromise his ability to fight, protect, and provide for his dependents. I know that Scott and Invid Marlene's story might have been continued in extended universe stories, but boy, what a downer it was to end The New Generations, and the original Robotech in its entirety, on.

I thought that ending Rook and Rand's relationship by showing them going off on continued feisty/flirty hijinks, without contrivedly forcing them into an explicit romance, did their relationship justice. I enjoyed their relationship on the whole: a bit playful, a bit antagonistic, a bit of rivalry, and only a hint of romance.

I loved the character of Rook a lot. It was nice to see a physically and emotionally strong female character who wasn't primarily a sexual or romantic object. She gave as good as she got with Rand, she could hold her own in a fight, and she was pretty much presented as just one o' the boys. That was refreshing.

I *must* talk about Lunk's haircut.

[Enjoy Wonka's Hair Repair Éclair in moderation](https://preview.redd.it/ucyq6gvp0b4e1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6019f8424d538c6e1db6f5fc27fc797a89f37e9)

I say this lovingly, but what the actual hell *is* that haircut?!  
There's hair that's kind of creeping up under his eyes...they're not sideburns or mutton-chops...I mean, I don't think humans *have* hair growth on that part of their face...it's kind of like there's hair where there shouldn't be, and no hair where there should be...kind of like Anton Chigurh...

[The New Hair Club for Men](https://preview.redd.it/ufbczrsl1b4e1.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=7765127c88f787c3ca4064c471312a2101c67e2a)

Since The New Generation is also effectively the end of the original Robotech, I can't help but ponder Robotech in its entirety with the conclusion of The New Generation. On the whole, I feel that Robotech peaked with The Macross Saga, fell pitifully low with The Masters, and was *okay* with The New Generation. And I understand that this is completely because of the weaving of three unrelated animes into a single mythos.

I feel like a proper, narratively consistent explanation of protoculture and the Invid Flower of Life was mostly botched. The last few episodes of The Masters set up some fascinating, albeit self-contradicting, possibilities, only for The New Generation to not really follow through with satisfying explanations.

The shadow of The Macross Saga obviously loomed large over the rest of the series. Both The Masters and The New Generation sprinkled references to The Macross Saga events and characters, but there weren't many/any references to The Masters in The New Generation. I'm sure the writers felt the lingering affection for The Macross Saga characters, which is why they had to keep referencing Rick Hunter, etc., hinting at his return, so his ultimate *absence* made all that feel like a big cocktease.

I can't decide whether it was a good thing or not for Robotech, as a whole, to end on a cliffhanger. Obviously, out-of-universe, it was *impossible* to have a proper conclusion to the series as a whole, because Robotech was the Frankensteinian melding of unrelated source material. Something that seems to be common to us, as a storytelling species, is that we collectively seem to want our stories to have beginnings (introductions), middles (the stakes are raised/adversity is encountered), and ends (adversity is overcome/conclusions are reached). I somewhat feel that for the Robotech writers to have undertaken this endeavor, knowing there was no way to provide that conclusion, was somewhat cynical. And I understand, there were sequel shows, feature-length cartoons, books, comics, etc....but generally, I'm not a fan of when a story ""jumps media"" to conclude a story, or fill in critical plot or character details. To paraphrase the great Harry S. Plinkett, in his monumental review/takedown of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, ""I don't give a f\*ck if it's explained in a novel, comic book, or any other media outside the \[show\]; if it's not in the \[show\] itself, it doesn't matter. The \[show\] should stand on its own, and if something important is left out, that's the \[show's\] problem, not a side story's responsibility.""  
Now, that said, some of the commenters to my first couple posts did kindly point out the continuation/back-filling of the Robotech plot in novel format, and I would like to read those -- but that's strictly out of personal interest. I still think it's a narrative failure on the writers' part that they did not do this within the bounds of the original creation.  
In this regard, I see a parallel with The X-Files, a show that was once near and dear to me. That show's creatives set into motion many intriguing plot threads in the original TV show. Then they added more plot threads via movies, then a sequel series. And after all that, they still have not given their viewers a narratively satisfying conclusion. And I think they've left their former fans frustrated as a result.  
I feel similarly with Robotech. The lack of definitive conclusion within the context of the original medium is disappointing.

I think those of us who were privileged to have seen Robotech during its first airing witnessed the birth of a new kind of storytelling for older kids/young adults: serialized storytelling that respected its audience's intelligence and tolerance for dark and mature stories. It had its warts and imperfections, and certain tropes associated with its era, but I think it was pivotal to mainstream acceptance of serialized, mature storytelling among Western audiences, and influential to subsequent generations of writers and creatives.

Most importantly: every rewatch of Robotech brings me back to my childhood, to a time of wonder at invading aliens, transforming mecha, and my heart reflexively skipping a beat every time I see Lisa Hayes.

[Goddamn, Lisa Hayes!](https://i.redd.it/j0bfnj53rb4e1.gif)

And with that...I think I might have said all I have to say about The New Generation, and Robotech as a whole. Thank you for tolerating my long post. It has been fun pouring out my thoughts on this show that's obviously left a lifelong impression on me as a viewer and others as writers/creatives. It's also been fun corresponding and cross-pollinating thoughts with commenters about this iconic gem of 80s-era Saturday morning cartoons, that is Robotech.",1,1733112488.0,robotech,0,1.0,False
1h4mds5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MagicMushroomUSA/comments/1h4mds5/how_why_to_grow_mushrooms_starter_guide/,How & Why to Grow Mushrooms (Starter Guide),"How & Why to [Grow Mushroom](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/)s (Starter Guide). Growing edible mushrooms at home is a fascinating process that can take many forms and yield very different results. Here we provide a brief overview so you know what you’re in for!

Growing [mushrooms](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/) is a rewarding experience when it goes well, and deeply frustrating when it goes wrong! Offering numerous wellness benefits and an insight into the weird world of fungi, it’s an activity that’s become increasingly popular, and for good reason. Mushrooms are not only a delicious addition to many dishes but also provide essential nutrients and antioxidants, making them a versatile part of a healthy diet.

This guide introduces the basics of [mushroom](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/) cultivation to total beginners. Find out why you should grow mushrooms at home, which varieties are most popular, and gain an overview of how you might go about it. Note, however, that this article is not about psychedelic mushrooms—only edible ones!

# Mushroom growing over the centuries

Mushrooms have been cultivated for centuries for both food and holistic purposes. While this is true the world over, there is a particularly rich history of mushroom cultivation in Asia, specifically China.

Historically, [mushrooms](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/) were often considered a delicacy reserved for the wealthy. In many cultures, they were also harnessed for their holistic properties, which were (and still are) considered to be effective and wide-ranging. Over time, the techniques for growing mushrooms have evolved, making it possible for anyone to cultivate them at home with relative ease. One key thing that binds all fungi is a love of moisture and decomposition!

# Benefits of growing mushrooms at home: Why grow your own?

There are numerous reasons to grow your own mushrooms:

* **Freshness:** Home-grown mushrooms are fresher and more flavourful than store-bought varieties.
* **Cost-effective:** Growing [mushrooms](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/) can save you money in the long run.
* **Sustainability:** Cultivating mushrooms at home is an eco-friendly activity, reducing your carbon footprint.
* **Wellness benefits:** Mushrooms are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, contributing to a healthier diet.
* **Educational and fun:** Growing mushrooms is a fun, engaging activity. It tends to require a fair bit of effort, but for those willing, it can prove quite addictive to discover how these strange, ancient organisms live.

# Most popular mushroom varieties

Being hundreds of millions of years old, there are plenty of mushroom varieties to choose from. However, to narrow it down for you just a little, here are several of the most popular to grow at home.

# Button mushroom

Button [mushrooms](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/) are among the most commonly grown and consumed varieties. Even if you don’t know them by name, it’s highly likely you’ve come across them before. They are versatile and can be used in a whole range of recipes due to their subtle flavour. Typically, these [mushrooms](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/) are grown on composted manure.

# Reishi

[Reishi mushrooms](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/) are prized for their holistic potential, particularly in traditional Chinese medicine, where their usage dates back over 1,000 years. They also have a distinct and much-loved flavour, making them a great option for cooks too. They are most often grown on hardwood logs or sawdust substrates.

# Lion’s mane

[Lion’s mane mushrooms](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/) are known for their unique, shaggy appearance and potential cognitive benefits. These mushrooms are worth cultivating just for their highly unusual, almost alien appearance. Strange indeed! They grow best on hardwood sawdust or logs.

# Vermont morel

Morel mushrooms are highly sought after for their distinctive flavour. They typically grow in the wild, but can be cultivated on specific substrates in controlled environments if you’ve got the skills. However, you should perhaps try out an easier species of mushroom before attempting the Vermont morel.

# King trumpet

King trumpet [mushrooms](https://mywayusa.shop/) are known for their thick stems and delicate flavour, making them a popular culinary option. They tend to grow best on sawdust substrates.

# An overview of mushroom growing methods

[Mushroom](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/) growing methods are almost as varied as the mushrooms themselves, with certain methods suited more to certain species. The trick is to try to mimic the [mushroom](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/)’s natural habitat. Here is a brief overview of common mushroom cultivation methods.

# Grow kit

[Grow kits](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/product/17-spiritual-cleanse-rape/) are the easiest way for beginners to start cultivating mushrooms. They come with all the necessary components and are sometimes even pre-inoculated with mushroom spawn. Otherwise, you can easily inoculate them yourself and let them grow. These kits minimise the risk of contamination and are a good place to start when growing mushrooms at home. Simply follow the instructions provided.

# Wood chip garden bed

Creating a garden bed with wood chips is a natural method suitable for outdoor cultivation, and it creates a sort of bridge between fully managed cultivation and wild cultivation. Although you set it up and have some control over it, the elements play a large role too. This method works well for varieties like wine cap and king stropharia. Necessary equipment includes wood chips, mushroom spawn, and a shaded outdoor area that is exposed to water (or you can water it). Pros include low cost and large yields, and the fact that a single pile of wood chips can sustain itself over many years. Some drawbacks include a longer setup time and potential contamination, such as that from other species of mushroom.

# Logs

Growing [mushrooms](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/) on logs is a traditional method that imitates the environment of natural dead wood. It’s ideal for shiitake and reishi varieties. It requires hardwood logs, spawn plugs, and wax to seal the inoculation sites. These are then often left soaked under a tarpaulin while the mycelium colonises the logs—and the mushrooms appear when the tarpaulin is removed. Some benefits are the natural, sustainable approach and potential for multiple years of flushes. Cons include the initial labour and longer incubation period.

# Pasteurised substrate

This method involves using substrates like straw, dung, or coffee grounds, which are then pasteurised to kill contaminants that may otherwise colonise it instead. Oyster [mushrooms](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/) thrive with this approach. The equipment needed includes a substrate, spawn, and a container. Some pros are fast yields and high productivity. The cons include the need for pasteurisation equipment and the potential for contamination if it goes wrong.

# Sawdust substrate

Sawdust substrates are ideal for [growing](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/) varieties like lion’s mane and shiitake. This method requires sawdust, spawn, and appropriate containers. Pros include versatility and high yields, while the cons are the need for precise moisture control, as sawdust can dry out quite quickly.

# From spawn to harvest: The 5 stages of growing mushrooms

When broken down, the process of cultivation can be split into five stages. Understanding each of these stages and what they require is key to preparing for your very own grow.

# 1. Mushroom spawn

[Spawn](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/), also referred to as spores, are like the seeds of mushrooms. From this, a whole crop will grow. Basically, without spawn, you have no way to grow your mushrooms. Therefore, it’s important to source [high-quality spores](https://mondomagicmushroom.com/).

# 2. Inoculation of mushroom substrate

Inoculation involves introducing the spawn to the substrate, allowing the mycelium to colonise it. Depending on the method and species, this may take place in a highly sterilised environment to prevent contamination. Some species are more vigorous and outcompete competition more easily.

# 3. Incubation phase

During incubation, the inoculated [substrate](https://midwesttecsolutions.com/) is kept in optimal conditions for mycelium growth—usually in a dark, humid environment. The temperature will depend on the variety in question, as each has different requirements. Depending on what and how you’re growing, this stage can last anywhere between a few weeks and many months. Only when a substrate is fully colonised with mycelium will the mushroom fruiting bodies appear.

# 4. Fruiting the mushrooms

Once the substrate is fully colonised, conditions are adjusted to trigger mushroom fruiting, such as increasing light and fresh air. This is often achieved by opening the substrate to the wider environment. Mushroom development is usually very rapid, taking mere days in some cases. At this point, the risk of contamination is reduced as the substrate will be well colonised with your desired mycelium.

# 5. Harvesting & further flushes

Mushrooms are harvested when mature, and the substrate can often produce multiple flushes with proper care. Some substrates, such as logs or wood chip piles, will continue to produce new crops each year. Other methods produce a single batch and are then finished.

# Common challenges and solutions in mushroom growing

Growing mushrooms can come with challenges, including:

* **Contamination:** This is perhaps the most common and frustrating problem people encounter when growing mushrooms. The environments in which they [grow](https://midwesttecsolutions.com/) are hospitable to a whole range of bacteria and fungi, and certain precautions must be taken to ensure that your chosen species wins.
* **Improper growth conditions:** Maintain optimal humidity, temperature, and light levels for the specific mushroom variety. Some species have quite specific requirements. For instance, mushrooms that grow in warm climates will simply not develop if the temperatures are too low.
* **Poor yields:** Regularly monitor and adjust conditions, and use quality spawn to improve yields. High-quality substrates that contain the correct nutrients are also key to achieving good results.

# Growing mushrooms at home: Well worth it!

Growing mushrooms at home can be an interesting endeavour that provides fresh, nutritious, and very tasty food. Plus, some look incredibly [weird ](https://midwesttecsolutions.com/)and cool while they’re growing! With the right approach and a bit of patience, anyone can start cultivating mushrooms—just be prepared for things to go wrong sometimes, as they often do.

1. The stew crew has decided that church is just another opportunity to film… We get to see Evan singing a special and we also see Layla putting on lipstick and combing her hair… the other parishioners at Clear Springs Baptist have to steer clear if they don’t want to be featured on Instagram.  Even though they have suffered numerous wrecks, Carlin and Evan continue to film while driving…Zade is forward facing in his car seat and Carlin’s seatbelt is barely an afterthought. Last week’s matching family Disney PJs are a distant memory and this week the Stewarts are in another set of family pajamas that are $50 a pair while they decorate their Christmas tree. We have not seen the new cult pastor or his clique with the Stew Crew in a while and things seem to be back to normal with Evan’s family so they head off to Nashville for the holiday. On the way, they stop at a gas station to film their children purchasing candy while harassing the gas station attendant all in the name of content. For some reason, poor Zade is wearing clown sized UGGs because his ever attentive mother forgot to pack his shoes and he is stuck wearing Layla‘s. He shuffles,, stumbles, and trips his way up the steps to see Poppa who rescues him and asks why he is wearing Herman Munster shoes… Carlin just stands back and films it all. Nini seems tepid around Carlin but resigned to the idea that if they want to see their grandchildren, the cameras are coming along. Evans’s brother Ethan shows up from out of town and he is definitely a single Pringle. Carlin takes no days off and is still slinging links on Thanksgiving day… They take the kids to a movie on Black Friday and she finally mentions her boutique and the sale going on there. Evan is promoting polo cologne and has to go change outfits because he is not wearing what Carlin instructed him to wear. Layla ate roll for Thanksgiving dinner and Zade loves the “mahRoRo”. They exclusively use subtitles when both children are talking… And that is constant because the camera never stops running. We see Layla as a diva demanding a hairstyle and I hope she keeps Carlin on her toes. We all know Layla is paying the bills so when she says she wants a ponytail with two braids, Mrs. Stewart better hop to it. Evan shows us a work session for him and Carlin that features both of them staring at their phones and laptops. He says they are answering emails, editing and discussing brand deals… that is just code for auctioning off their children to the highest bidder. Carlin is like a 7th grade girl who always has an injury and this week it’s her back. That backache is not going to stop her from jetting off to some unknown location and leaving her children behind. It does not matter that it is almost Christmas, the Stewarts are packing their passports and heading off on their longest flight ever to some unknown destination. Hopefully, Layla and Zade can live without the glare of the ring light while they are gone.

2. Before the Clark family jets to New Jersey, Katie has to promote her letters to Santa. The trick for Katie is to push this link without ever mentioning the word Santa. Mission accomplished, and the Clarks head to the airport where we see them red faced, wrestling a precocious almost 2-year-old. They seem surprised that it is not a walk in the park. Travis‘s parents pick them up from the airport, and we get to see them pull up to the mansion that Travis was raised in. Mama Clark has a week full of festivities planned and at one point, Travis says Katie has reached her limit. She looks exhausted but keeps her smile plastered on through it all. There is lots of family time and baby. Harvey gets to meet the patriarch of the Clark family. They all make ornaments and decorate the tree and go out to a fancy restaurant… All with an eight week old baby and tow.   Travis’s brother is a sneaker head and he has already purchased several pairs of sneakers for the infant. Money is not an issue for these people and momma and daddy Clark fully spoil Hailey. Travis says his granddad had a stroke and will need a procedure-he asks for prayer before they leaveJersey. Travis and Katie fly home on Black Friday where Katie tells us she plans to sit on her couch and shop… Instead, she walks all around her apartment linking everything that is not tied down… And some things that are.

3.  Josie Balka has been attending the Carlin Stewart school of  “How to win at influencing while exploiting your children” and this week it shows. Josie features lots of close-ups of baby Miles and the girls playing with baby Miles. We also see Willow featured in a reel, where she names the family Christmas tree. Willow is five years old now and needs to start earning her keep. The Balkas attend a fancy Thanksgiving dinner at Kelton‘s grandparents house where Kelton is in charge of cooking the turkeys. He spatchcocks them and Josie pretends to be grossed out for the camera over the process. While everyone else is enjoying Thanksgiving dinner, Josie sits in the car slinging black Friday links. Her trusty pool noodle is right there with her and you can get your very own for just $30 instead of the normal $40. The day after Thanksgiving, Josie goes out to buy coffee, even though she owns a fancy Nespresso machine, because she and Kelton are going to have the weirdest double date I have ever seen… His brother and sister-in-law come over and the four of them sit in the living room staring at their phones, drinking coffee and shopping. Later, Josie gets all glammed up to film a “get ready with me” to go find a Christmas tree… She happily promotes Skims pajamas and I can’t help but wonder if this is what Kim Kardashian had in mind?

4. Alyssa Webster really loves her grandparents… But not enough to head to the farm for Thanksgiving. Even though there was a small crowd at the farm this year… Alyssa chose to run away to an unknown location with her church friends. She posted tons of photos on Instagram of their getaway and most of the photos were of the little Prince Rhett. It is shocking that John Webster agreed to take his family anywhere… But a cabin on a lake shared with other couples still does not qualify as a family vacation. It did give Alyssa plenty of time to show off her hiking boots and ripped up jeans. Carlin commented saying “we miss you”… And Kelly Jo commented “beautiful”… Alyssa left them both on read. Who wants to place bets on whether she really comes home to Tennessee for her dad‘s 60th birthday?? In her YouTube Vlog this week the Webster’s head out to a parking lot to pick out a Christmas tree.Of course we get to see John and Alyssa stop at a coffee shop to get themselves a treat while the girls get nothing. Allie tries to pick a tree, but her mom ignores her, later she asks if she can water the tree and is told to go fetch a ball for the prince instead. Allie is a full-time sister mom now and you can see the sullen look on her little face. The YouTube viewers pick up on this and the comments on the Vlog are loud. People really feel for Allie. Later, Alyssa posts a landscape video on Instagram and captions it “no filter needed”…  I guess she thinks a filter is needed for her beautiful children and herself. In all of the many pictures and videos she post over Thanksgiving-there is no sighting of the sad hat.

5. Whitney Bates is the hardest working influencer you ever did see. She must single-handedly be supporting her family through the sales of Debloat  pills, collagen powder, magnetic photo frames, teeth, whitening strips, and $40 floss. She also finds time to model for and promote the boutique… She posts two ads for every one that Carlin posts. In between all of that selling, she still found time to host thanksgiving for her family at their home this year. Zach was super busy in the Bates kitchen over the holiday. First up was a little exploitation of his kids making biscuits. Next, he drags Kelly Jo back into the kitchen for another disaster dessert. They screw up the measurements and instead of editing, they just let it roll… They also don’t edit out Zach sticking his fingers into the pie and licking it on camera and using those same hands to spread coconut and pecans everywhere. Kelly is just a short hop away from being a talkshow host because she really takes over and Zach is happy to let her. Later, he is back again with a lobster mac & cheese recipe featuring zero seasoning and 4 1/2 pounds of cheese. He also forgot his microphone for most of it. God I hope he never changes because this kitchen deal is the last bastion of realness that this family has left. He is also sponsored by those grody microwave meals… Just the perfect fit for a cooking channel… Now that they are running with the big time influencers… They are also showing their kids more often and Whitney full on films the children at the movie theater and during a movie. Nothing like a family of seven with a flash camera in your neighborhood theater.

6. Trace and Lydia are back together again and took Ryker to the park this week. He was decked out in a snowsuit and Trace basically threw him down the slide while Lydia filmed. Wheeee…. Then it was off to South Carolina to spend Thanksgiving with Poppa Bill and momma Jane. Trace and Lydia are the only married couple who were there for Thanksgiving. Gil and Kelly Jo were there along with Isaiah, Addee, Ellie, Callie, and JebJud. Jane said that Kelly was doing all of the cooking this year, but she was still at the stove on Thanksgiving morning with an assist from Addee and Ellie. We see Addee in a leg brace and Trace says she hurt her leg playing with her nieces and nephews. Trace challenges Ellie to a bow and arrow contest and she absolutely smokes him and hits a bull’s-eye. He has to do exercises all the way up the hill and back down and it just about kills him. Ryker spends a lot of time with his great grandparents, and they all get to eat inside at the table because it is such a small crowd. Soon enough, they head back home, where Lydia films a day in the life with her and baby Ryker… The poor kid wakes up in a crib, moves to a highchair, and then his car seat and finally gets to sit in a stroller while watching his mom work out at the Jesus gym. They head to Lydia‘s family’s home for a late Thanksgiving dinner featuring meatloaf and ham. Trace says they have a big announcement coming next week so be sure to stay tuned… How many weeks has it been since they were in Hawaii??

7. Last week, Brandon and Michael told us things would be changing for them in the new year on their social media… And this week we get a glimpse of what that might be as Michael is suddenly sharing links.  Her store has a huge black Friday sale that she is promoting and then she has links for all of her favorite black Friday deals. She promotes toys, sewing accessories, makeup, hair care products, and even neutrafol that she says Josie gifted her. They seem to be in Washington DC for Thanksgiving as Michael says they are in the city they got engaged in. The Vlog is a Christmas quiz where they ask each other questions and get every single answer wrong. While discussing Christmas memories, they share a lot of footage of their trip to Dollywood with the Balkas. Michael seems to be very close with Josie‘s children, and Brandon also seems to adore them. We see Josie and Kelton walking around while Brandon films and Josie looks like the girl next-door and not the fundie Kardashian. Will the Keilens become full-time influencers? Michael must be desperate to get Brandon out of working a normal person job.

8. You know what is a lighthearted, fun gift to give a little kid for Christmas? A set of flashcards that explains righteousness and sovereignty and how you should be clothed in it. Doesn’t that sound like what is on every kids wish list?? Well lucky for all of you playing Santa because Erin Paine has created a set of the most boring flashcards known to man and she is willing to sell them to you. Sadly, the Paines are not able to travel to the farm for Thanksgiving because their children are sick. Instead, they stay at home where they entertain their dejected mother by reciting Psalms 100. After that Carson brothermom‘s the little ones during a turkey craft and then they say a prayer of thanks over cheese and apples. Just another day in paradise. Later, we see Chad and the kids playing with other kids (baby goats). No one seems to be in a hurry to pack up and leave the swamp compound, even though they said they had to be moved before Christmas… will the sheriff have to evict them or will they go willingly?

9. Tiffany Bates finally got her greatest wish and after many months, she is back in California for an entire month. Sadly, she had to bring Lawson along with her. Lawson is selling a Bible app and Tiffy would like for you to purchase Lawson Bates music and merch for the holidays… If you do, they will send you their Christmas card and Lawson will sign your CD. They finally drop a new YouTube video and it is almost too painful to watch. It is a day in their life and features Lawson cooking breakfast, Tiffy filing the babies fingernails and it’s all sponsored by a washing machine company. Maybe they only drop a Vlog if they have a sponsor for it because they are only averaging about one video every six weeks… In the world of YouTube, where things move fast, that is just not going to cut it. We do find out that baby Will suffered from thrush as a newborn. Tiffy calls it “thresh” and says she now sanitizes his bottles. They each talk directly to the camera like game show hosts and say “guys”about 250 times each. 

10. Bits and Bytes… Kelly pays tribute to Whitney’s dad… Bates Sisters Boutique will open their doors for holiday shopping… Lawson and Tiffy attended church with her grandmother in California… Gil Bates was back this week at the farm wrangling cows with Trace. 

Have a great week friends. Hope you found some great holiday deals and did it WITHOUT clicking one single influencer link!

1h4mcyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BringingUpBates/comments/1h4mcyw/breaking_down_bates/,Breaking Down Bates,"1. The stew crew has decided that church is just another opportunity to film… We get to see Evan singing a special and we also see Layla putting on lipstick and combing her hair… the other parishioners at Clear Springs Baptist have to steer clear if they don’t want to be featured on Instagram.  Even though they have suffered numerous wrecks, Carlin and Evan continue to film while driving…Zade is forward facing in his car seat and Carlin’s seatbelt is barely an afterthought. Last week’s matching family Disney PJs are a distant memory and this week the Stewarts are in another set of family pajamas that are $50 a pair while they decorate their Christmas tree. We have not seen the new cult pastor or his clique with the Stew Crew in a while and things seem to be back to normal with Evan’s family so they head off to Nashville for the holiday. On the way, they stop at a gas station to film their children purchasing candy while harassing the gas station attendant all in the name of content. For some reason, poor Zade is wearing clown sized UGGs because his ever attentive mother forgot to pack his shoes and he is stuck wearing Layla‘s. He shuffles,, stumbles, and trips his way up the steps to see Poppa who rescues him and asks why he is wearing Herman Munster shoes… Carlin just stands back and films it all. Nini seems tepid around Carlin but resigned to the idea that if they want to see their grandchildren, the cameras are coming along. Evans’s brother Ethan shows up from out of town and he is definitely a single Pringle. Carlin takes no days off and is still slinging links on Thanksgiving day… They take the kids to a movie on Black Friday and she finally mentions her boutique and the sale going on there. Evan is promoting polo cologne and has to go change outfits because he is not wearing what Carlin instructed him to wear. Layla ate a roll for Thanksgiving dinner and Zade loves the “mahRoRo”. They exclusively use subtitles when both children are talking… And that is constant because the camera never stops running. We see Layla as a diva demanding a hairstyle and I hope she keeps Carlin on her toes. We all know Layla is paying the bills so when she says she wants a ponytail with two braids, Mrs. Stewart better hop to it. Evan shows us a work session for him and Carlin that features both of them staring at their phones and laptops. He says they are answering emails, editing and discussing brand deals… that is just code for auctioning off their children to the highest bidder. Carlin is like a 7th grade girl who always has an injury and this week it’s her back. That backache is not going to stop her from jetting off to some unknown location and leaving her children behind. It does not matter that it is almost Christmas, the Stewarts are packing their passports and heading off on their longest flight ever to some unknown destination. Hopefully, Layla and Zade can live without the glare of the ring light while they are gone.

2. Before the Clark family jets to New Jersey, Katie has to promote her letters to Santa. The trick for Katie is to push this link without ever mentioning the word Santa. Mission accomplished, and the Clarks head to the airport where we see them red faced, wrestling a precocious almost 2-year-old. They seem surprised that it is not a walk in the park. Travis‘s parents pick them up from the airport, and we get to see them pull up to the mansion that Travis was raised in. Mama Clark has a week full of festivities planned and at one point, Travis says Katie has reached her limit. She looks exhausted but keeps her smile plastered on through it all. There is lots of family time and baby. Harvey gets to meet the patriarch of the Clark family. They all make ornaments and decorate the tree and go out to a fancy restaurant… All with an eight week old baby and tow.   Travis’s brother is a sneaker head and he has already purchased several pairs of sneakers for the infant. Money is not an issue for these people and momma and daddy Clark fully spoil Hailey. Travis says his granddad had a stroke and will need a procedure-he asks for prayer before they leaveJersey. Travis and Katie fly home on Black Friday where Katie tells us she plans to sit on her couch and shop… Instead, she walks all around her apartment linking everything that is not tied down… And some things that are.

3.  Josie Balka has been attending the Carlin Stewart school of  “How to win at influencing while exploiting your children” and this week it shows. Josie features lots of close-ups of baby Miles and the girls playing with baby Miles. We also see Willow featured in a reel, where she names the family Christmas tree. Willow is five years old now and needs to start earning her keep. The Balkas attend a fancy Thanksgiving dinner at Kelton‘s grandparents house where Kelton is in charge of cooking the turkeys. He spatchcocks them and Josie pretends to be grossed out for the camera over the process. While everyone else is enjoying Thanksgiving dinner, Josie sits in the car slinging black Friday links. Her trusty pool noodle is right there with her and you can get your very own for just $30 instead of the normal $40. The day after Thanksgiving, Josie goes out to buy coffee, even though she owns a fancy Nespresso machine, because she and Kelton are going to have the weirdest double date I have ever seen… His brother and sister-in-law come over and the four of them sit in the living room staring at their phones, drinking coffee and shopping. Later, Josie gets all glammed up to film a “get ready with me” to go find a Christmas tree… She happily promotes Skims pajamas and I can’t help but wonder if this is what Kim Kardashian had in mind?

4. Alyssa Webster really loves her grandparents… But not enough to head to the farm for Thanksgiving. Even though there was a small crowd at the farm this year… Alyssa chose to run away to an unknown location with her church friends. She posted tons of photos on Instagram of their getaway and most of the photos were of the little Prince Rhett. It is shocking that John Webster agreed to take his family anywhere… But a cabin on a lake shared with other couples still does not qualify as a family vacation. It did give Alyssa plenty of time to show off her hiking boots and ripped up jeans. Carlin commented saying “we miss you”… And Kelly Jo commented “beautiful”… Alyssa left them both on read. Who wants to place bets on whether she really comes home to Tennessee for her dad‘s 60th birthday?? In her YouTube Vlog this week the Webster’s head out to a parking lot to pick out a Christmas tree.Of course we get to see John and Alyssa stop at a coffee shop to get themselves a treat while the girls get nothing. Allie tries to pick a tree, but her mom ignores her, later she asks if she can water the tree and is told to go fetch a ball for the prince instead. Allie is a full-time sister mom now and you can see the sullen look on her little face. The YouTube viewers pick up on this and the comments on the Vlog are loud. People really feel for Allie. Later, Alyssa posts a landscape video on Instagram and captions it “no filter needed”…  I guess she thinks a filter is needed for her beautiful children and herself. In all of the many pictures and videos she post over Thanksgiving-there is no sighting of the sad hat.

5. Whitney Bates is the hardest working influencer you ever did see. She must single-handedly be supporting her family through the sales of Debloat  pills, collagen powder, magnetic photo frames, teeth, whitening strips, and $40 floss. She also finds time to model for and promote the boutique… She posts two ads for every one that Carlin posts. In between all of that selling, she still found time to host thanksgiving for her family at their home this year. Zach was super busy in the Bates kitchen over the holiday. First up was a little exploitation of his kids making biscuits. Next, he drags Kelly Jo back into the kitchen for another disaster dessert. They screw up the measurements and instead of editing, they just let it roll… They also don’t edit out Zach sticking his fingers into the pie and licking it on camera and using those same hands to spread coconut and pecans everywhere. Kelly is just a short hop away from being a talkshow host because she really takes over and Zach is happy to let her. Later, he is back again with a lobster mac & cheese recipe featuring zero seasoning and 4 1/2 pounds of cheese. He also forgot his microphone for most of it. God I hope he never changes because this kitchen deal is the last bastion of realness that this family has left. He is also sponsored by those grody microwave meals… Just the perfect fit for a cooking channel… Now that they are running with the big time influencers… They are also showing their kids more often and Whitney full on films the children at the movie theater and during a movie. Nothing like a family of seven with a flash camera in your neighborhood theater.

6. Trace and Lydia are back together again and took Ryker to the park this week. He was decked out in a snowsuit and Trace basically threw him down the slide while Lydia filmed. Wheeee…. Then it was off to South Carolina to spend Thanksgiving with Poppa Bill and momma Jane. Trace and Lydia are the only married couple who were there for Thanksgiving. Gil and Kelly Jo were there along with Isaiah, Addee, Ellie, Callie, and JebJud. Jane said that Kelly was doing all of the cooking this year, but she was still at the stove on Thanksgiving morning with an assist from Addee and Ellie. We see Addee in a leg brace and Trace says she hurt her leg playing with her nieces and nephews. Trace challenges Ellie to a bow and arrow contest and she absolutely smokes him and hits a bull’s-eye. He has to do exercises all the way up the hill and back down and it just about kills him. Ryker spends a lot of time with his great grandparents, and they all get to eat inside at the table because it is such a small crowd. Soon enough, they head back home, where Lydia films a day in the life with her and baby Ryker… The poor kid wakes up in a crib, moves to a highchair, and then his car seat and finally gets to sit in a stroller while watching his mom work out at the Jesus gym. They head to Lydia‘s family’s home for a late Thanksgiving dinner featuring meatloaf and ham. Trace says they have a big announcement coming next week so be sure to stay tuned… How many weeks has it been since they were in Hawaii??

7. Last week, Brandon and Michael told us things would be changing for them in the new year on their social media… And this week we get a glimpse of what that might be as Michael is suddenly sharing links.  Her store has a huge black Friday sale that she is promoting and then she has links for all of her favorite black Friday deals. She promotes toys, sewing accessories, makeup, hair care products, and even neutrafol that she says Josie gifted her.

The Vlog is a Christmas quiz where they ask each other questions and get every single answer wrong.

So far, I’ve been on two dates with this girl:

First date: We went to a park (no money spent).
Second date: We watched a movie and grabbed dinner. I paid for everything without even giving her a chance to offer splitting.

Now, I’m wondering about the third date. I was thinking of keeping it simple, like going to a coffee shop. But here’s my question:

Am I still expected to cover the entire date? Would it be okay to ask her to split the bill, especially since I’m on a tight budget? Or does that come off as rude?

I really like her and want to keep seeing her, but I also need to be realistic about my finances. What’s your take on splitting bills in this situation? Would love to hear your perspectives!",1,1733112341.0,Bumble,1,1.0,False

1h4mah4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1h4mah4/new_to_community_and_feeling_alone/,New to community and feeling alone,"Hi guys,

I am 25 (AFAB) and just found out in early November that I am most certainly definitely autistic. I joined this subreddit the other week to begin my journey, and little did I know I had the hardest times coming up ahead. I’ve been masking my whole life, and have been in various stages of burnout for the last 7/8 years. I have been feeling like I need a lot of support from my husband (29) and he has been telling me for a while that it’s okay and he understands. I get very overstimulated in the mornings because I don’t want to go to my customer facing job, I feel sick to my stomach, I hate getting dressed, I hate how I look, and somehow I manage to turn this frustration into anger at him. I always apologise profusely after the fact, and every time I wonder why I can’t control my frustration and sometimes rage…. I also have habits of self deprecation when we get into arguments because I feel so guilty for how I’ve behaved I guess, and I guess I’m not communicating properly. 

I have a hard time watching new movies and shows, I don’t always love going out to movies and coffee shops (mostly because of money tho), and all around I ask a lot of my husband. I struggle with intimacy because we have to live with my parents right now, and generally living with them has overstimulated me more than I could process well. I knew we were both handling this cycle in our own ways, but for the most of the time he said he understood and it was okay. I felt bad for leaning on him so much, especially because I knew he was adjusting to life in a new country (we moved from the UK back to the US where I’m from) and had recently been diagnosed inattentive ADHD. We were also suspecting AuDHD. He’s always been a sensitive guy who struggled to find his words in arguments, and I am ashamed to say I can be mean when I get really upset. 

I always thought we got through these moments though, and I always apologised not understand why I always took things so intensely. 

I guess where I’m headed is that I probably should have been finding advice and support from this group sooner, and I want to start somewhere.

Last week my husband left me. We’ve been married almost 3 years (in January) and together 6. We made it through a pandemic and living in a tiny attic space in his parents home through out that. We had these issues a lot but I always thought they kept getting better.

2 weeks ago he confided that my behaviour in the mornings before work was really starting to weigh on him. I began the conversation calmly but before I knew it I was beating myself up, because I just felt so bad I had done that to him and made him feel that way. He was upset because he didn’t want it turned back on him, he didn’t want to have to be okay with it. Quite frankly I didn’t want to be okay with it either, I just didn’t know what to do. We took an hour apart and when he came back he said he couldn’t do this anymore, and that he wants to go home to the UK. He said it’s all weighing up so much and he just wants to go home.

We talked for hours and felt like we really got somewhere, and spent the week together with me being anxious about certain little driving habits and being grumpy. Sunday last week rolls around and I have a new routine I set out with my therapist. I’m determined not to get upset in the morning, but then he says something that really upsets me: It’s about our rides into work, and I just get so frustrated he’s asking this trivial question when we’ve already spoken about it (and I felt it made the most logical sense) that I snap at him. I stop and I immediately breath out and say that wasn’t fair I’m sorry, and I think at one point that morning I said hey it’s not you but maybe it’s a good idea to stay clear of me right now, love you.

He was quiet to work and brought me a treat to I forced myself to eat, and he went to do some temporary work for a friend. I don’t hear from him all day because work was busy and I assumed he was too. I reached out and immediately he seemed different and closed off. To make matters worse there were customers in the store who literally made the biggest mess I have ever seen. It took over an hour to clean up, merchandise strewn everywhere, and I asked him to come in and wait with me while I frantically cleaned the place. I don’t remember it much honestly, but I was very irritated and I probably said something to him like “get out of the window view I don’t want people thinking you’re a customer and we’re open!!”

He was quiet when we got in the car, and I gave him a present that I got from work. He smiled but again something was off.

We get home and I finally press him to tell me what’s wrong. 

He said he didn’t work today and he spent the whole day packing and he’s leaving to the UK in the morning. I don’t know what I was thinking but I wasn’t thinking that.

We spent the next hours talking and me crying, and I honestly can’t say I know how it all went. But in the morning I continued to cry and he suddenly decided he wasn’t going to go, this was crazy, and I was his home and he needed to cancel the flights. I said I didn’t want to be the reason he’s staying (because this whole time he was saying he couldn’t do this anymore and he didn’t know if he wanted this anymore). He insisted not, and his family even insisted to fly us both back for a bit (which I was wanting to do) but he insisted it was wrong and we pushed the flights to July.

We spent the day talking, despite the overstimulus of my family moving around outside the room, and I told him I want to do better. I want a list of things to choose from to be able to be more attentive to his needs, because I thought that would help me stay organised. I said we need 2 solid days a week to just spend in bed all day to watch movies and TV, and I needed to take more responsibility for myself. We walked a bad movie and I really felt it was okay.

I woke up at 5 am and he want in bed, I called out for him and look across the rooms but I didn’t hear or see him until he came up and said he’s sorry but he can’t sleep and he just needs to leave. He can’t think, and he only knows he wants to go home. At that point I didn’t really cry, I just realised there was nothing I could do. I didn’t know how it had gotten to this point.

He told me he couldn’t give me any answers as to if he’s coming back, he barely said goodbye to our cats (3 and 4 years old) and asked to be whisked to transport before my parents woke up. He didn’t want to be talked out of it again (my dad the night before dug into him because he made a commitment to me when we got married and he wanted him to stay and work through this).

I dropped him off and when he unloaded the car he had more bags than I expected. He packed to leave.

I hugged him and told him I loved him and I would see him soon, and he smiled and waved goodbye, and that was it. He has had clipped and short responses letting me know about his travels, but that was it. 

I should also mention that we had thanksgiving plans that were very stressful due to other family issues and drama, and initially he was prepared to have the car ready and packed so we could escape to a safe haven if it all got too much.

Anyways today is… Sunday, right. So now a week since that first booked flight. He called me yesterday and said it was over, he didn’t love me anymore and hasn’t for a while, he didn’t want to give me any false hope, and he didn’t see a future with me anymore, and yeah he wants to wait until the new year to do anything more but he didn’t want to string me alone.

As much as I had been tearing myself apart from Tuesday-Friday thinking he was going to leave me, I didn’t expect me to refuse any counselling efforts. I have acknowledged that I had clearly messed up in ways I didn’t realise and I want to be better, but he said he’s tired of being a caretaker and he has made so many compromises for his life and himself that I don’t appreciate. And I don’t make compromises.

I largely don’t understand this because he always has the space to enjoy his hobbies, and I have done nothing but push him to pursue his dreams. It’s a hard career (game design), but it’s worth it because he’s talented and can achieve anything he sets his mind to.

Although I realise maybe my aversion to new shows and tv must be part of this, I still don’t have any examples as to why this has ended things for us. Apparently the list I had suggested earlier as well was wrong, and I should just know the things he wants all the time (I spoke to two of my best friends who said that’s a normal thing they do for each other because they like the structure, they are both autistic lol). I have used him up he’s said, and although this is speculation I don’t think he reflect fondly upon anything about us…. Which is just so different than how he’s been talking and texting me before all this started.

He says it’s been a year or more he’s been feeling this way, and he’s the happiest he’s been in years, and there’s nothing I can do to even try counselling. I said this can’t be fair because I’ve just found out so much about myself, and I’m awake and hear you have problems and I want to fix them. But it seems like he and his support systems are not moving on this and I am having to move forward.

I haven’t been eating or sleeping, but I have been trying hydrate. I’ve been being obsessive and messaging friends a lot, and feel like I’m annoying and spamming people, and am just beginning to feel like I have been a horribly neglectful and abusive friend and partner.

I never saw it that way and I swear I can identify things I’ve done and said to show him I love him, but he doesn’t think so and I’m just so confused. This really came out of nowhere, because aside from my morning and overstimulated moments we were always cuddly and close, and loved to just spend time together. Things certainly have gotten in a rut lately, but I didn’t think it was anything different that we hadn’t gone through before.

Anyways this is insanely long and I’m just sat here thinking I should write this all out and see if anyone wants to read, and can resonate in any way with what’s happening. Of course I want assurance that he’s going to come around with more time, but I’m not holding out hope. I’ve been trying to tell myself that this freak out and leaving is an affect of the Wellbutrin he’s been on for his ADHD for the last 3 months, but he’s and his family is adamant he’s making the right choices.

I don’t know what to do with myself, he’s my person and I always thought we could get through anything. Hell we have?! I’m going to try and get some sleep now and I’m very sorry for the length (and probably rambling gibberish), if anyone actually reads this I’ll reply to any questions because obviously there’s a lot of details I left out…. But yeah here’s my indoctrination into the subreddit! I’m sorry it has to start like this, but I hope maybe I can find some comfort somewhere. I want to have faith that time with pull through, because maybe I’m crazy but I just don’t feel like this ends a marriage without at least trying counselling together……but I guess I’ve been a monster and out of touch with that too so I don’t trust any reality anymore. 

Thanks if you got this far 🥺

I can’t even do a TDLR 😣

Hopefully before Christmas so you can enjoy it before or on the day. But if it arrives after, then let the merriment roll on into the new year. 

I typically enjoy sending Christmas cards to family and friends, but this year I decided to expand the cheer out a little bit. 

Now I don't have a whole lot of stamps, so snails are limited. I'd say about 20 for national and 5 for international. Maybe. I'm not the best at math. BUT! If ya would like a little something extra this year in the mail box, message me yer P.O. address and in due time something will be in there from me. 

If you do decide to send a card/letter back, please be cool and not creepy. 

Note: If you are seeking for a semi-long/short term correspondence, let me know in the letter/card. I'm not looking for long term penpals, but if the writing is good (meaning have good talks) then I may just consider it. In other words I'm open to the idea.

Little on me: I am a Christ centered introvert who enjoys art, music, film, reading, some writing, outdoors, indoors, large crowds, and isolation. I enjoy humor, history, and hummus. Coffee on a early cool morning. And herbal tea on a chill night. (Is this enough info, or too much?) 

So, if you'd like a Christmas letter/card from me this month, message me. If not, then i hope you find someone who you can write to. Either way, may you have a wonderful holiday season, and take care. Keep on the writing. Go snail mail!

It’s December 1 and I’m the only one in this house without an advent calendar because my (28f) boyfriend (32m) couldn’t be bothered to get me a silly little box of candy or trinkets even though I spent two months telling him it was important to me. 

We’ve been together for five years. Lived together for three. The first year we lived together we shared a wine calendar which I bought when I picked up little treat calendars for my kids. We aren’t big drinkers and don’t necessarily want a full glass each day, so splitting it at dinner was a fun treat for a month. The second year he was called away by his job so the kids had theirs and I had a super cheap chocolate calendar so they wouldn’t think something was off (we always did them together and they would notice). 

Last year I got him a coffee calendar. My mom sent me a calendar. He didn’t get me anything.  I didn’t buy me anything. My mom took care of it. The kids had theirs. He also didn’t fill my stocking so I didn’t open one. Everyone else did. This was after quite a few comments about how it’s so sad that moms usually have to buy their own stuff and fill their own stockings if they want to feel included. His was filled with candy and snacks, as were the kids’. Stockings are usually just fun treats and small toys in this house. Low value. 

This year I asked in October what he wanted for an advent calendar this year. He didn’t know. In November I asked what kind of calendar he was getting me because I said I was thinking about doing something a little different and didn’t want to have everything be wildly different (if one has candy and everyone else has trinkets and legos, my youngest would notice and say something asking where mom’s toy is or ask to have the candy AND the toy. Kids. Too observant when they don’t need to be.) He said something about the themed candy calendar I saw an ad for and showed to him. 

Everyone has candy this year. Everyone but me. I didn’t buy a calendar for me. It’s December 1. I made a comment about how we will just have to share the chocolate calendar I bought. He said that wasn’t fair if they each got their own. 

I snapped. He has no clue why. Everything I’ve bottled up for months came out. He’s mad at me and not speaking to me now. It was the last straw.

Just by running the numbers I knew I was drinking enough to kill myself in the distant, possibly near, future. I tried many different methods I don’t care to list in an attempt to stop but I kept going back.

Finally, I forced myself to get a vivitrol shot and I’ve been sober the last 17 days because of it. I’ve read and am currently reading books on addiction and alcohol. The ones I’ve connected with most are Dharma related such as Refuge Recovery. I’ve enjoyed early sobriety. I drink coffee again (couldn’t before because of severe anxiety), read peacefully, go to work on time, and try to take in as much life around me as I can. I’ve even been able to get to sleep with minimal night sweats the last night or two.

But part of me just wants to wait out the rest of the shot (not follow up on my next one as the doctor ordered) because I miss the high of drinking. All the meetings, books, and advice seem to assume I must stop because my life has been destroyed. But I’m still holding on to my responsibilities, albeit meekly. That part of me just wants to get my blood work done, see if I’m dying or not, then dive back in. I may not know what I’m talking about, but it really feels like I could drink myself to death before I hit that serious rock bottom that everyone seems to allude to.

I’m a fairly well off person: white, straight, well educated, but I drink to drown something I can’t seem to unpack. Something just can’t sit right inside of me at night and drinking “helps”.

I know that chasing cravings will lead to suffering. I know that it’s not sustainable and that true happiness comes from accepting both the transient pleasure and pain of life. I know that every depressive episode I’ve had has been a result of drinking. But sometimes I just miss it too much. That part of me wants to keep rolling the dice, even welcome rock bottom because it means I can chase the high all the way down.

I'll also provide links to the episodes :

Firstly, The LEGO Ninjago Movie is non-canon and exists in a different universe from the TV series, so it doesn't technically have a specific place in the viewing order. However, it's preferable to watch it after Season 7 (Hands of Time).

Secondly, Ninjago is divided into three series (excluding the movie): Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu, Ninjago, and Ninjago: Dragons Rising. However, Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu and Ninjago are essentially the same series. The name change occurred plus change in animation studio after Season 10, but the story and characters continue seamlessly, so they can be considered one continuous series.

I will mention the canon books/comics separately at the end.

1h4lyjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/fednews/comments/1h4lyjq/navigating_a_discrimination_accusation_made_in/,Navigating a Discrimination Accusation Made in Confidence,"Hi all,

I left a meetup with one of my coworkers yesterday feeling like I may have a responsibility to take action, even if what we discussed was private. Sorry for the long post, tl;dr at the end if you want to skip.

She invited me out for coffee to go over her resume due to recently being passed up for promotion. As I had been promoted last year, she was hoping I could provide insight on why and help refine her stuff. For reference, I'm not a supervisor, just a higher grade in a SME position. I was also not involved in the hiring process.

When she showed me her resume I knew right away that she wasn't writing to the position nor highlighting what management wants to see. I explained my reasoning and provided feedback, and while she was initially receptive, she became pretty frustrated after about an hour.

She explained that even if she wrote a resume identical to mine, she wouldn't be selected due to being a woman. She added that she would have to be twice as good as a man to even be considered. When I asked why she thought that, she said that it is an accepted fact that discrimination in our office is rampant.

Now, I 100% acknowledge that I am a man and may be blind to what she is facing. I do also acknowledge systemic sexism is a real thing in many offices/institutions. I likewise understand the gender pay gap and know that women can have a much more difficult time entering/succeeding in many fields. I personally, however, do not believe our office is one of these environments. 

I have not seen discrimination and believe we have a good culture about speaking up about issues. Additionally, the majority of our management are women, the hiring official who didn't promote her was a woman, historically we have had an almost 50/50 gender split, and I'm confident that there is no discrimination in pay (benefit of knowing who is what grade). Not to say women can't discriminate against women, but I don't see it here and believe that there is fair representation. So, I disagreed with her assertion that being a woman is why she didn't get promoted. I did acknowledge that there may be institutional issues that disadvantage her, but tried to bring her perspective back to the weaknesses in her resume.

She was not happy with this and stated that if I can't identify the issues, I'm a part of the problem. I tried to get her to provide examples of the issues, but she said she wasn't comfortable disclosing them to me due to my seniority and ""duty to report"". I offered to connect her with resources and ways to anonymously report discrimination (IG/EEO/OSC), but she didn't seem receptive to that either due to fear of reprisal. Before we left I asked if there was anything I could do to help, and she said ""please don't try, you said you don't know the problems"". Overall, I think our professional relationship is now poor and that my office may have massive discrimination issues.

How in the world would you navigate this? On one hand what she described is absolutely unacceptable and should be addressed, but on the other hand I have no idea the issues she speaks of and she also asked for me not to take action. While it could just be an exaggerated rant, it has serious implications.

decided about two months ago to slowly bring back carbs into my diet but after a week went back to over doing it with carbs but still stayed active and gained about 5lbs back. Energy went down and mood also went downhill. 

Today starts my journey back to carnivore as I felt my best while doing it. Hope the shits aren’t bad the second time around and it’s an easier transition. I was doing carnivore with black coffee and cheese a few times a week which helped not cheating during those 6months. 

Glad to be back on this lifestyle change.

I have put them together in a google drive for anyone to download
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DmCcOpv2pb9S1VcwaUhgy_nMINMuxwaR?usp=sharing

Some notes regarding these props. Most of the props are different sizes than regular letter size in order to produce variety in the set of props. You should be able to see the properties of every page to get a sense of the size of the page after it is cut. Some pages have cutting marks so that you can have the correct dimensions after they are cut. Some are on white paper, green pastel paper, legal sized paper, beige paper, and a variety of aged paper. Also some props have modified slightly to make more context within the setting and way they are obtained. Such as having the changes to the chant be in Red ink as the original chant would have been a summoning spell instead of a binding spell. This would show a progression of how this threat was dealt with over time.

I had also created a number of extras since the scenario says the investigators find a ""sheaf of yellowed papers"" and I created a representation of those pages. As well as the deed to the property. All/most of the props are based on some period appropriate ephemera. For the torn out page of the De Vermiis Mysteris, you should tear just above the sigil on the page. The envelope for the property deed can be cut from a larger paper if you want a more unique envelope look.

The remaining physical props are just glass corked vials filled with coffee and sugar, a mini sarcophagus, and cookie container for ""metal box"" at the hospital and a random wooden box I had laying around for the objects found at the farm house.

If you happen to run the game and reproduce these props, I would love to see them!

I’m an ex-Muslim, and I thought I’d stop by here for a coffee (wink).

A small number of people in our community, after leaving Islam, decide to join Christianity. Honestly, I can sometimes understand why. Some people feel a need to believe in something bigger than themselves and look for simpler answers to explain the world around them.

Christianity, especially when coming from Islam, seems like a straightforward religion. There are no strict rules dictating how to eat, who to talk to, what to see or hear, or even how to poop (yes, Islam includes guidance on all of these—and more).

This has led me to a question: Why did you leave Christianity? Were you, in some way, feeling restricted from enjoying life? What made you question the religion? From my perspective (and I admit, I don’t know much), Christianity appears to be a faith you could believe in quietly, almost in the background, while still enjoying life almost to its fullest and even when not believing it completely , you are still a good believer.

I’d love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for sharing, and please excuse any gaps in my understanding.""

Just made it through Thanksgiving without cheating my carnivore diet. I didn’t restrict my calories at all. Ate a ton of buttery eggs, turkey, and prime rib. Not sure is butter is cheating, but I like chicken so I expect I’ll need some additional fat from butter. Also drinking black coffee, but I may try quitting for new year res. I didn’t get the headache everyone warns about, but I was noticeably irritable a few times through the week. My testosterone must be up because my lifts are great, and I’m sleeping better.

Imagine this: it's late at night, the deadline is looming, and my code is tangled in a web of errors that would make even the most stoic developer weep. I had two choices—accept defeat or call in reinforcements. Naturally, I went for the latter. Enter AI, my tireless, always-on, coffee-free coding companion.

What followed was nothing short of digital magic. With a few well-phrased prompts (and, let’s be honest, some trial and error), the AI quickly sliced through my tangled mess of logic like a katana through butter. It didn’t just suggest solutions—it offered insights, optimized my approach, and even formatted everything in a style that would make my code reviewers shed a tear of joy.

And the best part? It never complained, never judged, and never once rolled its eyes at my questions (unlike some of my colleagues). By the end of the night, my project wasn’t just fixed—it was better than ever.

Wife 36+ and I got arranged marriage (Families found match), with 2-3 months of courtship period.

It was typical married life with ups and down but things changed for worse post we had kid.   Sex Life dried up to non-existent state. It's been like that for past 6+ years ( physical intimacy once in 3 months that too feels weird). Worst issue is zero intimacy. No hug, no causal kiss, no hand holding, not even an unintentional touch of skin. It's driving me crazy to the extent that I contemplated divorce on multiple occasion but let go of those throughts due to our daughter (can't put her through this). We sleep in different rooms now (daughter sleeps with wife)

I am an average looking Indian, maintained my weight well, play sports over weekend, receding hair line (family genes), earns really well (consulting profile, long hours, late night work). Give full attention to family over weekends and as time permits during weekdays.

My wife is beautiful, bit cautious about her weight gain but I love her the way she is and physically attracted to her all the time. She teaches in a university, give amole time to our daughter, house

Loss of Sex drive I can accept, may be I am not attractive anymore, but I CRAVE for a bit of emotional intimacy. I dred to live rest of my life as a friend zoned husband!! Told her at times about my feelings, frustrations, nothing moved her.

I buy expensive jewellery on special occasions, take her to nice holidays, weekend getwayas. Everytime we go on a romantic getaway she gets her periods, irrespective of the time of month.

This is how we are planning to reconfigure the space on the right side. Angular sofa, one side facing the tv. On the bottom, we plan to put a bench with storage space. This area is more geared towards kids play area, and we may add a coffee table in front of the bench.

Any feedback and idea?

They meet at a coffee shop where she meets Adora by accident. There is a bond that forces Catra to be close and knows when she is in danger.

Once again, Superman and Wonder Woman stood in the aftermath of a foiled heist. The criminals, now bound and groaning on the pavement, were subdued, but the tension in the air was anything but.

""You broke his leg!"" Superman’s voice was firm, his arms crossed as he glared at Wonder Woman.

""He’ll live,"" Wonder Woman replied flatly, sheathing her sword. ""Maybe next time, he’ll think twice before endangering innocent lives.""

Superman frowned. ""There are better ways to handle this. Violence isn’t always the answer.""

""And letting them off with nothing more than a slap on the wrist? How has that worked so far?"" she shot back, her tone sharp.

The argument escalated, their voices clashing like the titans they were.

From a rooftop a few blocks away, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen watched the scene unfold.

Jimmy, camera in hand, chuckled. ""You know, those two should just get a room already.""

Lois shot him a glare. ""Shut up, Jimmy,"" she snapped, her tone harsher than she intended. The slight blush on her cheeks betrayed her.

Jimmy raised his hands in mock surrender, smirking. ""Just saying.""

After the criminals were handed over to the authorities, Superman and Wonder Woman stormed off in opposite directions, both clearly irritated.

A short while later, at a cozy café tucked away in a quieter part of the city, Clark Kent and Diana Prince sat across from each other at their usual table. The warm glow of the café lights softened their features as they chatted, both visibly more relaxed in their civilian guises.

""—and then Perry threw a stack of papers at me because I accidentally used the wrong font on the headline,"" Clark said, shaking his head with a grin.

Diana laughed, a light, melodic sound. ""You’re the only person I know who can turn an office mishap into a funny story, Clark.""

""Occupational hazard,"" he replied, taking a sip of his coffee. ""What about you? How’s life as a history lecturer?""

Diana leaned back, smirking. ""Well, let’s just say teaching students who are more interested in their phones than ancient artifacts is a lesson in patience.""

The two laughed together, their earlier frustrations melting away in the warmth of their friendship.

Eventually, Clark glanced at his watch. ""I should probably head home before I miss another deadline. Lois will have my head if I forget tomorrow's report.""

Diana smiled. ""Go on then, Mr. Kent. I’ll see you tomorrow.""

As Clark walked away, Diana watched him through the café window. A soft smile lingered on her lips as she whispered to herself, ""I wish more men were like you, Clark. Gentle... respectful."" She sighed, thinking of the brash, self-righteous Superman who always seemed to get on her nerves.

At his apartment, Clark placed his coat on the rack and collapsed onto the couch. Before he could relax, his phone buzzed.

It was Lois.

""Kent! I hope you haven’t forgotten the report for tomorrow. I’ve reminded you three times already!""

""Got it, Miss Lane,"" he replied, stifling a yawn. ""It’ll be on your desk first thing.""

As the call ended, Clark glanced at the towering poster of Wonder Woman plastered on a nearby building, visible through his apartment window. Her supporters had put it up, her determined gaze staring back at him.

He sighed, leaning back against the couch. ""Women are so complicated,"" he muttered to himself, shaking his head.

After a moment, a small smile tugged at his lips. ""I wish they could all be more like Diana.""

I met my ex today for coffee after 3 months of no contact, I prepared a 4 page hand written letter in case things went well, or completely wrong.

I wrote it mostly for myself as closure, and that was also my core intention to give it to her.

I was fully open to rekindling, but she was mostly seeing it as friends, which she told me up front but insisted on meeting up either way (yes I know, stupid to agree to). 

Despite all that, the day went great, we laughed, caught up on what we’ve both been up to, despite the fact that we knew before hand our intentions were slightly different.

Near the end I will admit that I got a little emotional but held it mostly inside, and just told her it was time for me to go home. She definitely saw that one tear though.

She offered a hug, told me she’d love to catch up again but put the ball in my court for the next meetup. So I decided to give her my heartfelt letter after. It wasn’t anything begging her to come back, but mostly what I’ve learned from reflecting, and a form of appreciation for her and what we had.

During the coffee, she told me that the reason she suddenly deleted me from all socials 2 months into NC, was to protect both herself and me from feeling more pain by seeing the other have fun or moving on.

Here comes the fun part: She also told me she was going to concert by herself tonight… 

As if the algorithms aren’t scary enough, I suddenly see her Tweet on my for you page which states: 

“Opening all my socials up because I’m looking for this guy wearing this certain outfit at this concert today, who asked if I was single and alone, and what my name was, I NEED TO FIND YOU”

A fucking sting deep, very deep, in my heart. I know some of you will be rational and say: well, she’s single and she doesn’t owe you anything. Which is completely true, but this entire timeline feels like a major stab in the back.

My letter has been completely neglected, again, she doesn’t owe me anything, not even a response to it, but following up with this action on the same day all of this happened, knowing how much more I’m still hurting… you’ll probably get what I’m trying to say.

This is poorly written and probably misses context for anyone to give a reasonable response to, although I’d be open to one. But what I’m mostly asking is to fuel my anger, as this is probably the best opportunity for me to move on, maybe even hate her a little, at least for a while, so I can end my own suffering which doesn’t seem to stop a single bit over the last 3 months.

In that span of time we decided to move in together in a house we both would pay for but under my name. When the idea/ opportunity to buy this house came to us we decided to split all payments equally i.e. mortgage, utilities, etc. When mortgage was due our first month in the home my boyfriend had no problem paying his half. When second month mortgage was due my boyfriend brought up that his portion would come later in the month and he just didn’t have the money right now to pay me. I told him don’t worry about this month and he can get me back next. As months went on he never paid his half of the mortgage he owed and previous months to the point where he had not paid his amount of the mortgage for 6 months. Personally I hate bringing up money when it’s owed to me, it makes me feel uncomfortable, I would tried to subtly bring it up and his answer would be “you never asked” and my reply would be “I shouldn’t have to” and that would usually be the end of the conversation. I kept making excuses for him in my head like he was saving money for something like an engagement ring, since we frequently talk about getting married and spending our life together. On thanksgiving I was laying in bed feeling a little under the weather when my boyfriend came downstairs. I ask if he’d go get me a coffee to help perk me up since we’d be leaving soon to go to his family’s thanksgiving. He refused saying he had no money to get me a coffee. I snapped “what you don’t have any money? You have barely any bills and have been skipping out on an $800 payment for the past 6 months how don’t you have any money”.  He didn’t have much to say other than he really didn’t know. I was extremely dumbfounded since he had received a 10k bonus to reenlist into our states NG a couple months back and has a good paying job. I told him since we’ve moved to this house I’ve been paying the mortgage and half of the utilities and was still able to put away 11k into my savings. He ended up going to his family’s alone while I stayed at home. The next day I decided to help him make a budget and started going through his bank statements when adding up his expenses I realized that he was only paying $200 a month to live in our house while I was paying $1,600 a month and paying for most house OPTEMPO expenses i.e. furniture, decorations, half of food expenses. When realizing this i felt sick to my stomach. This man makes about 4,200 a month with monthly expenses (not including his half of the mortgage) $1,500. He spent 10k and almost 3k a month, on what? I am not too sure his statements bid not have extremely high transaction. 

I feel used, and not really sure what to do. I’m scared if i stay with him i will have to monitor him like a child when it comes to stuff like this. I don’t want to break up with him but i feel my feelings for him fade everyday i see him because it reminds me of what he did and honestly it disgusts me.

1h4laq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/1h4laq7/the_deep_analysis_of_monster_anime/,THE DEEP ANALYSIS OF MONSTER ANIME,"MONSTER ANIME'S INETERPRETATION

Just a few hours ago, I finished watching Monster, and after spending some time reflecting on it, I’ve finally arrived at an interpretation and a review. I’m almost 15, and yes, you may judge me if you wish, thinking a child shouldn't be exposed to such a complex anime. That’s your opinion, and I respect that. However, I’ve always been drawn to topics that demand deep contemplation, and if you’re still with me, I appreciate it.

In my interpretation, I began to grasp its layers. Typically, I search for morals in any story I encounter. And here too, I found some:

If you don't have good memories, seek them out—create them now. Just as darkness cannot dispel darkness—only light can—hate cannot drive out hate. Only love can accomplish that.Yet the overarching theme remained elusive, and that’s what challenged me. It made me confront those values more intensely. It left me grappling with deeper questions: Does every life hold equal value? For me, perhaps yes. Is there such a thing as irredeemable evil? I believe, probably not. And what of the ancient struggle between good and evil—who is more powerful? The answer, I think, lies in their duality. Good and evil stand as polar opposites, almost in balance.

However, learning that in Urasawa’s next novel, Another Monster, Johan later becomes a good person makes me think that perhaps good holds a slight edge. But only just. Can killing ever be justified? Perhaps, if it is done for the sake of a greater good. And is it essential to eradicate evil? That, I think, depends entirely on one’s own nature. Yet evil, I feel, can never be fully erased. Without it, goodness itself might lose its sharpness, its meaning, fading into something dull and unremarkable.

I watched Monster over the course of about ten months. Many people tend to compare it with Death Note, but I didn’t see them in the same light. However, if one were to draw comparisons between the two, Death Note undoubtedly stands out with its gripping plot and clear narrative. Yet, the true beauty of Monster lies in what it doesn’t show. It doesn’t hand you answers on a silver platter; instead, it tests your patience, leaving you to wrestle with its complexities. Some viewers dislike its ambiguous ending, but that’s precisely where its brilliance shines. The uncertainty reflects the very essence of human nature and the biggest moral questions we face. We simply don’t know the answers. And that’s where Monster excels—it compels you to think.

What is the monster? Perhaps it’s the embodiment of perfect evil, or more precisely, Johan Liebert. But what is the answer to perfect evil? It is perfect goodness—or better yet, Dr. Tenma. And where is this monster to be found? Inside us all. Whenever we give in to evil, we become monsters. And when we choose good, we become like gods. It’s that simple. The choice is always ours to make.

As for Monster’s central lesson, it isn’t found in the final episodes. We grasp it much earlier. One moment that stands out is when Grimmer saves a child from suicide, a child poisoned by Johan’s nihilistic worldview. The answer to that nihilism? Grimmer’s love. This, I believe, is the heart of the story. One more good takeaway was that one scene where one of the characters is going on to assassinate someone but stops after seeing that person drinking coffee and adding sugar. He gets overwhelmed by the realization that once you commence on the path of evil that ""sugar"" or sweetness in your life disappears. This makes us think that being ""hated"" is bad. But being the ""hater"" is even worse. Those who hate, they become the prisoners of narrow mindedness and get immersed in deep guilt. No matter what, they could never recover from that guilt. Thus they lose the sweetness in their life. Hate is twice ""cursed"". It brings sorrow to the perpetrator as well as the victim. It's polar opposite of Shakespeare's concept of mercy which is twice ""blessed"" as it blesses both the giver and the taker. It gives peace to the give as well as hope and happiness to the taker. But still, we humans, often choose to hate rather than love. I get reminded on Michael Jackson's words - ""In a world filled with hatred, we must dare to love."" See, hate is unnatural emotion. A little child never hates. But as he grows up, he is taught to hate. And just like hate can be taught, so too can love. That's why we need to ""re-teach"" how to love. That scene was also profound.

There are still some lingering questions to consider (ones I can’t fully articulate at the moment):

Do all people deserve a second chance?

What was the significance of names in the series? Perhaps it suggests that a name reflects one’s worth. Johan, by having no real name, might believe that he lacks any inherent value. Ultimately, Monster isn’t for everyone. It’s a story for those who are patient, reflective, and willing to delve into deep philosophical thought. Like me, for instance—I absolutely loved it. For anyone seeking a brutally honest portrayal of human nature—its highest virtues and darkest flaws—presented in a slow yet captivating manner, this anime is worth watching.

This happened in my early twenties, and to this day, I can’t fully explain it. It started with a disturbing dream my mom had the night before. Her boyfriend at the time, who worked as a security guard at the local hospital, shared what happened the next morning, and it left us both shaken.

He told me that around three or four A.M., he was up early, getting ready for work. He was sipping his coffee and half-watching random shows on TV when he began to hear whispering. At first, it was faint but distinctly aggressive, almost like it was right outside the front door of the apartment. Confused by the timing and tone, he got up to check. But as he approached the door, the sound stopped. Thinking it was nothing, he went back to his coffee and TV.

Then it happened again. This time, the whispering was louder—clearer—and unmistakably coming from right outside the front door. Feeling a mix of curiosity and irritation, he moved quickly to open the door and look around, but again, there was nothing. No one in sight, no sounds.

He shrugged it off as odd but not impossible, until it happened a third time. Only this time, there was no whispering. Instead, he heard a deep, guttural man’s voice almost yelling—and it was coming from my mother’s room.

Panicked, he ran to her room and swung the door open. My mom was laying in bed, speaking in a man’s voice he couldn’t recognize. The words were garbled and unintelligible, but the tone was dark and commanding. He flipped on the light, shouting at her to wake up, and she eventually did—shaken and confused.

She told him she’d been having a nightmare about a shadowy figure trying to force itself on her. She described the figure as something dark and menacing, unlike anything she’d ever dreamed before.

As her boyfriend was telling me this the next day, we were both sitting in the apartment kitchen. He was just reaching the part about the yelling when suddenly, the lights in the kitchen went out—except for one. The timing was too perfect to dismiss. Both of us froze, adrenaline spiking, and without even saying much, we grabbed our things and left the apartment in a hurry.

When we came back later, everything was normal. All the lights were working fine, and nothing else strange happened after that. To this day, I can’t help but wonder what exactly was going on that night. 

I get chills retelling this one to this day. An unnerving feeling. Was so strange, he had promised my mom not to tell me about it. I’m glad he did but it just leaves me with questions.",5,1733108777.0,Thetruthishere,2,1.0,False

1h4l5yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterAnime/comments/1h4l5yg/the_deep_analysis_of_monster_anime/,THE DEEP ANALYSIS OF MONSTER ANIME,"Just a few hours ago, I finished watching Monster, and after spending some time reflecting on it, I’ve finally arrived at an interpretation and a review. I’m almost 15, and yes, you may judge me if you wish, thinking someone of my age shouldn't be exposed to such a complex anime. That’s your opinion, and I respect that. 

However, I’ve always been drawn to topics that demand deep contemplation, and if you’re still with me, I appreciate it. In my interpretation, I began to grasp its layers. Typically, I search for morals in any story I encounter. And here too, I found some: If you don't have good memories, seek them out—create them now. Just as darkness cannot dispel darkness—only light can—hate cannot drive out hate. Only love can accomplish that. Yet the overarching theme remained elusive, and that’s what challenged me. It made me confront those values more intensely. It left me grappling with deeper questions: Does every life hold equal value? For me, perhaps yes. Is there such a thing as irredeemable evil? I believe, probably not. And what of the ancient struggle between good and evil—who is more powerful? The answer, I think, lies in their duality. Good and evil stand as polar opposites, almost in balance. However, learning that in Urasawa’s next novel, Another Monster, Johan later becomes a good person makes me think that perhaps good holds a slight edge. But only just. Can killing ever be justified? Perhaps, if it is done for the sake of a greater good. And is it essential to eradicate evil? That, I think, depends entirely on one’s own nature. Yet evil, I feel, can never be fully erased. Without it, goodness itself might lose its sharpness, its meaning, fading into something dull and unremarkable. I watched Monster over the course of about ten months. 

Many people tend to compare it with Death Note, but I didn’t see them in the same light. However, if one were to draw comparisons between the two, Death Note undoubtedly stands out with its gripping plot and clear narrative. Yet, the true beauty of Monster lies in what it doesn’t show. It doesn’t hand you answers on a silver platter; instead, it tests your patience, leaving you to wrestle with its complexities. Some viewers dislike its ambiguous ending, but that’s precisely where its brilliance shines. The uncertainty reflects the very essence of human nature and the biggest moral questions we face. We simply don’t know the answers. And that’s where Monster excels—it compels you to think. What is the monster? Perhaps it’s the embodiment of perfect evil, or more precisely, Johan Liebert. But what is the answer to perfect evil? It is perfect goodness—or better yet, Dr. Tenma. And where is this monster to be found? Inside us all. Whenever we give in to evil, we become monsters. And when we choose good, we become like gods. It’s that simple. The choice is always ours to make. As for Monster’s central lesson, it isn’t found in the final episodes. We grasp it much earlier. 

One moment that stands out is when Grimmer saves a child from suicide, a child poisoned by Johan’s nihilistic worldview. The answer to that nihilism? Grimmer’s love. This, I believe, is the heart of the story. One more good takeaway was that one scene where one of the characters is going on to assassinate someone but stops after seeing that person drinking coffee and adding sugar. He gets overwhelmed by the realization that once you commence on the path of evil that ""sugar"" or sweetness in your life disappears. This makes us think that being ""hated"" is bad. But being the ""hater"" is even worse. Those who hate, they become the prisoners of narrow mindedness and get immersed in deep guilt. No matter what, they could never recover from that guilt. Thus they lose the sweetness in their life. Hate is twice ""cursed"". It brings sorrow to the perpetrator as well as the victim. It's polar opposite of Shakespeare's concept of mercy which is twice ""blessed"" as it blesses both the giver and the taker. It gives peace to the give as well as hope and happiness to the taker. But still, we humans, often choose to hate rather than love. I get reminded on Michael Jackson's words - ""In a world filled with hatred, we must dare to love."" See, hate is unnatural emotion. A little child never hates. But as he grows up, he is taught to hate. And just like hate can be taught, so too can love. That's why we need to ""re-teach"" how to love. That scene was also profound. 

There are still some lingering questions to consider (ones I can’t fully articulate at the moment): Do all people deserve a second chance? What was the significance of names in the series? Perhaps it suggests that a name reflects one’s worth. Johan, by having no real name, might believe that he lacks any inherent value. Ultimately, Monster isn’t for everyone. It’s a story for those who are patient, reflective, and willing to delve into deep philosophical thought. Like me, for instance—I absolutely loved it. For anyone seeking a brutally honest portrayal of human nature—its highest virtues and darkest flaws—presented in a slow yet captivating manner, this anime is worth watching.

","*\[ Reposting from before; thanks to everyone who send me a card already, the post services are very fast sometimes \]*

  
My birthday is in the first week of January, I usually feel like shit those weeks before and after due to numerous traumatic events. I also live very lonely and secluded life - for reasons. I think it would be cute to receive some abstract but warm messages from you, people of Reddit, since this community feels like good old internet that I loved and that was my home. I **love surprises,** poetry and awkward pieces of knowledge. I also love frogs, animals at work, especially cats (like cats of Istanbul that work all kinds of occupations), pixel art and glitch, old school internet and computers, black&white, advertising (not ad cards per se, but some advertising posters, vintage maybe).

1h4kydg,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1h4kydg/screamed_at_me_for_over_an_hour_over_sugar/,Screamed at me for over an hour over sugar.,"I just wanted to post here because I am feeling down and a little terrible about the situation. For some background since I'm new here, I (23F) live with my grandparents. I grew up in a very unstable home with two horrible parents. My mother I still don't talk to but my father and I's relationship is on the mend right now. I came to live with my grandparents almost 9 years ago now. The situation was getting bad at home and I moved states and in with my grandparents (Grandparents on my mothers side) in order to have a better life then what I thought I was going to have staying with my divorced abusive parents. What I didn't know was basically that I was coming out of the frying pan and into the fire. My grandmother is very hard to explain without making her sound like the worst kind of human. She isn't all bad... but she isn't a great person to be around a lot of the time and my grandfather is more absent and tends to just disappear  during the daylight hours. 

Now to the current situation. I (23 F) was with my boyfriend (29 M) hanging out at his house and playing video games. My grandmother knew where I was and (even though I am 23, I still ask before I go anywhere besides collage and work as is her rules) I had already gotten all my classwork done and didn't work so I was hanging out with him. My boyfriend and I were having a great time and playing our Stardew Valley farm when my grandmother called me mid-game and before I could say hello started screaming through the phone at me. At first I was confused as to what she was so mad about because all she said was that I was stupid and dumb and a horrible person. At this point I am already feeling horrible. I don't know what is going on yet but I know that whatever it is that I did must have been really bad. In a break in the screaming I asked her what is wrong and she then started yelling at me and saying ""Nyx, You do not take my god damn sugar and use it. You do not use my stuff. God damn it."" And then she hung up. I was shocked and I didn't realize I was even crying until my boyfriend hugged me. For some context: I used about 4 tablespoons of sugar for my coffee that morning because the sugar container that I keep filled (bought with my own money) was empty and I hadn't been to the store yet. I honestly didn't think she would notice if I used 4 tablespoons of her sugar.  Not even 10 minutes after she hung up she called me again. My boyfriend told me to ignore the call but if I did then the situation would be so much worst when I got home. I answered the call and she proceeded to say ""How are you so stupid? You are such a lazy waste of space. You eat my food and take my shit and you don't even shampoo my carpet or scrub the bathtub anymore."" She said more things and basically spent the next 15 minutes insulting me and calling me various names. At the end of the call I was sobbing and my boyfriend held me, not knowing what to do. I told him that I should probably go home before I make things worst for myself by staying. 

Once home I went straight into my room until she stormed in and started yelling at me again. For 45 minutes she screamed at me and I can't say anything or do anything, I just have to take it or it gets worst. Once she is done she dismisses me and only then can I go and hide in my spot. (I know that I am an adult but when she is like that it makes me feel better to hide somewhere smaller and dark so that I can calm down and feel safe, right now that place is in my closet behind my clothes). I just feel hurt and I try to do everything she needs but I am walking on eggshells all the time and I am so tired. 

For some more information: I can't just move out. It isn't an option right now because she has her fingers in all my financials as well as my car and several other things. I have been trying to find a way to quietly move out without a huge fallout and her using her strings to bring my life crashing down around me. I am tired though, I feel alone and I can't help but feel like a prisoner in my own home. I know that this isn't healthy but I am not sure what to do or how to do this anymore.

","I was trying to drink more water, so I pivoted from coffee to those caffeinated/vitamin B water enhancers (think Mio). 

I was drinking water bottles full of this stuff every day, probably 4-5 bottles with multiple servings in each one. 

Seemingly out of nowhere, my skin erupted! I had painful, inflamed, even swollen patches all over my skin. It was breaking out EVERYWHERE on my fave with MASSIVE pustules. I even posted here about it at some point asking for help. I would just drink more water (and thus more of the Mio) thinking maybe I was just dehydrated? 

One day, as I sat there exhausted and feeling “off,” I realized how much I was drinking and googled symptoms of vitamin B overdose. I felt kind of crazy - imagine my shock when I read that I WAS OVERDOSING ON VITAMIN B! 

Not only was my skin breaking out but it was the weirdest texture - like my moisture barrier was broken, and my makeup would just sit on top of my skin. Simultaneously oily and flaky and red. It hurt so, so, so much. I would tweeze little whiskers and they’d turn into red bleeding pits. It was absolutely terrible. I really can’t emphasize enough how painful my face was. 

I really had done so many different things to help my skin and was increasingly frustrated. I had a pretty good routine down, so the whole thing was bizarre. 

I quit drinking it and my face healed in like, less than a week. Insane.

I have been on T for 5 months. I have been out to *every single* person I have ever known since I was 13, trans since 12.

 It's not noticeable whatsoever since T has not given me any pronounced/obvious passing effects. Which is quite devastating and as equally exhausting as not being out. I got very burnt out in high school trying to pass only to be met with getting misgendered at a new school. 

I dressed very feminine despite being out, which was unusual after attempting to pass for over 4 years. Now, I'm starting to adapt the same attitude with my new job. I work in the death care industry which is stuck in older morals as many older folk run the business. Even on funeral directing subreddits, I surprisingly got a lot of hate comments. They didn't upset me but it's very backwards to have no retreat in the industry.  

Is it okay to feel like the ""risk"" over the ""reward"" is worth not staying out to my coworkers despite the copious amount of dysphoria? My management team at my old funeral home were good about me telling the but nobody seemed to ""remember"", whether I repeatedly corrected them or not. Previously being a barista at two major coffee chains, that was no issue for anybody. I just fear that when I do pass after being on T 6+ months, I'll be the ugliest girl and my coworkers will be upset I never told them.

Binny’s Pick

Proof: 116

Nose: Rich vanilla and the warm, buttery crust of a freshly baked cherry pie. Juicy cherry notes take center stage, vibrant and inviting, with a subtle campfire smokiness adding depth. As I continue to drink, fresh coffee ground notes emerge at the end. A fascinating nose that I couldn’t get enough of.

Palate: Wow. Honey and ripe, syrupy cherries coat the tongue, complemented by the sweetness of cherry hard candy. The flavors are absolutely mouthwatering, with a velvety, pleasantly oily mouthfeel. Drinks smoothly, with warmth and complexity that are well under the proof.

Finish: A long, satisfying finish where sweet cherry lingers beautifully. Mint and oak emerge, balancing the sweetness, with light peppery notes and baking spices providing a crisp, spicy close.

Conclusion: This whiskey blew me away. By far the most interesting bottle in my small collection right now. The cherry notes were exquisite, making each sip a luxurious experience. I can’t wait to see how it evolves as it opens up further.

1h4kr4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1h4kr4w/7_years/,7 years,"I was 19. It was my second-ever date. I was forcing myself to meet people from Tinder. X was the second. 

I recognized him from across the street. He was sitting at the bar lining the glass front. He looked different from his pictures, not in any meaningful way; I just had a different face in mind. I ordered my food and sat next to him. I had to lean in whenever he talked. He spoke very quietly. I did like his eyes, somewhere between light blue and light green with a big patch of brown on the left eye. Later he would tell me he felt special growing up for having heterochromia. I would have felt special too. 

I didn’t think he liked me. But he insisted on walking me to my bus stop when I said I should go, and he asked if I wanted to do this again, with that same small frown he always has on his face. I hope he isn’t taking pity on me. I have to believe he isn’t.

We go to the arts fair on our second date. We sit on a rancid sofa to watch the video art exhibition. He sits a good two feet away from me. Third date, we go sunbathing. He has his half-tank nude binder on. I keep my shirt on. I tell him I think something might be wrong with me.

Fifth date, he says “I think you’re more invested in me than I am in you.” Gets on his bike, rides away.

Two years later: how have you been? I’ve been pretty good, you? Pretty good too; wanna get coffee sometime? I’d like that. Great. :)

I text Emily about it. She warns me that I might just be setting myself up to get hurt. I agree. I put on cologne and leave the house.

We end up getting pizza. He changed his hair; he bleaches it now. It works. He seems to smile more easily. When we part ways, I lean in to hug him. He hugs me back. I’m swallowing down how much this means—his small, bony body, the smell of his cologne, the way his face rests on my shoulder. When I get home I can still smell his cologne on my shirt.

Three months later: I ignore Emily’s text and cut open the last of my boxes. This is what I’ve brought to be with him. I don’t need much. Knife, toothbrush, pills, phone charger, camera, journal, pens, a few sets of clothes. He is playing the electric guitar unplugged. His window unit is fighting against the heat. I go to sleep. I wake up with him in my arms.

Two months later: Landlord needs us out. Isabel hasn’t been spending much time here anyways. Gavin, I don’t know what he’ll do. X and I have friends—new friends of mine, old friends of his, Mary and Colin, a stripper/law student + a potential rockstar/weed dealer, who are moving into an apartment building across the rivers. New development. Beautiful exposed brick walls. We move in.

One month later: We are right next to the river. The rivers are brown even on a clear day. He gets down on one knee. I thought he was taking me on this walk to break up with me. I say yes.

Three months later: This apartment lets in a lot of light when it’s empty. We assemble the bed together. God I wish I could talk to him. I go to my friend’s house. He goes to sleep alone. 

One month later: The center diamond fell out of my ring. I don’t know how. There are three. The center one fell out. I spend hours searching the debris on the steps of our apartment building. I can’t find it.

One month later: I tell Emily I love her. She sets her mouth in a hard straight line. “I’m sorry,” she says.

One month later: I’m bored in our room and I pull out a spiral-lined notebook. “Dear Emily,” it says, “you are nine months old…”

Two months later: X’s mother leads me slowly down the stairs. “And this is my husband’s ‘man cave,’” she says, laughing. She catches the edge of a bookshelf in her fingers and pulls it aside. It opens into a small room lined wall to wall with guns. Carbines. Assault rifles. Snipers with their legs folded in. A shelf of MRE packets in the back. She shuts the shelf. “Men!” she laughs.

“Have you ever shot a gun?” I ask him. “Yeah, the small ones they give to kids at the range. They gave me a little pink one.”

“That’s fucked.”

“I don’t know. It makes you feel powerful.”

Thirteen months later: I’m so sorry. I wish I had more answers for you. I don’t know why. It’s just not working anymore.

You were always working on music when we were together. You finally released it when I left you. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

It changes all the time!,"I mean, I understand, that in theory, you have a certain IQ which is relatively stable and doesn't change that quickly. But, what kind of mental performance does this abstract number actually represent? Does it represent your average performance, or your peak performance?

Taking an IQ test will never give you this abstract number that represent either your peak cognitive performance or your average performance - the only information it will tell you is about your performance AT THE TIME OF TESTING.

And it depends on a lot of factors, such as: how well did you sleep last night, did you drink coffee or not, what time of day it is, are you fresh or tired, how well hydrated you are, are you hungry or is your stomach full or too full perhaps, etc...

I think our IQ changes all the time and may oscillate around some number that represents our average performance even up to +/- 15 IQ points.

For example if I got tested 5 times, at random times and in random situations, the average of those  results would likely give me my IQ score that represents my average cognitive performance... For the sake of discussion, let's call this number X.

Now, if I do the test very fresh, hydrated, in the morning, after some light meal and some coffee, I might score close to my peak performance, and it's likely to be somewhere around X+10.

On the other hand if I do the test when tired, in the evening, or after a heavy meal, or if I skipped my coffee, I might score somewhere around X-10.

And if I get actually drunk, and try to do the test then, then I might score X-20 or even lower.

I think we have regular daily oscillations of IQ.

It probably peaks an hour or two after waking up, and then slowly declines as the day progresses, reaching the bottom just before we go to sleep.

She wasn’t a gamer by any stretch, but her little brother, Max, had begged her to bring him. While he dashed off to battle pixelated aliens, Mia wandered aimlessly, soaking in the flashing lights and beeping sounds.

That’s when she saw him.

He was leaning over a claw machine, his brows furrowed in concentration. A mop of curly hair framed his face, and his hoodie had a faint coffee stain on the sleeve. The machine’s claw dangled precariously over a stuffed panda, and he muttered under his breath, willing it to grip.

Mia couldn’t help but smile. “That panda’s not going anywhere,” she blurted before she could stop herself.

The boy turned, startled, and then grinned sheepishly. “Yeah, this thing’s rigged. But I’m already five dollars deep, so I’m committed.”

Mia chuckled. “Need help losing more money?”

He laughed, a warm sound that made her stomach flutter. “Why not? I’m Ethan, by the way.”

She joined him, coaching him on timing the claw—though she wasn’t much better at it. After a few failed attempts, Ethan finally snagged the panda, holding it up triumphantly.

“For your expert guidance,” he said, handing it to her.

Mia’s cheeks flushed as she took it. “Thanks. But I think you’re the one who did all the work.”

They spent the rest of the afternoon talking. Ethan told her about his dreams of becoming a game designer, while Mia shared her love of photography. Time seemed to blur, the arcade fading into the background.

When it was time to leave, Ethan hesitated. “Hey, would you maybe want to hang out again sometime?”

Mia smiled, clutching the stuffed panda. “I’d like that.”

As I discover what I can do to turn this place into my own personal paradise on earth, planting bonsais, fruit trees and vegetables, I decided to setup two compost bins to reduce my carbon print and recycle the kitchen stuff. Which basically turned most of my waste to fertilizer. 

As I was reading up on how to do this, I realized something. 

I had to balance the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in this homemade little universe. 

Carbon came from brown stuff; dead tree leaves, twigs, papers, cardboard etc. 

And nitrogen came from green stuff; cut grass, unwanted parts of spinach, leek, even coffee grounds.

I drilled holes in boxes to provide oxygen.

Then it occurred to me; all of this was once something else. And though we referred to them as dead, as it was the case with tree branches, leaves etc, in the end they were material made possible by physical manifestation after right elements of nature, right vitamins, minerals etc cake together.

And they were now going back to nature to get cycled.

The fact is, even if I didn’t do this, leaves would still get absorbed by wet soil. 

It’s just that by doing so I chose where and how their nutrients would get distributed.

Under the great scheme of things, we are no different. 

So death is a transition really, not the end.

What upsets us about death of others is the sentimental value of people or pets for us, and with ourselves, the unknown, what will happen once we are gone.

The thing is, we will never be truly gone. 

It’s just that we will change forms. 

Now, will you come back as someone else or “something” else?

Probably not.

Because there won’t be a “you”.

“You” as an entity is the sum total of what everyone else assigned to you; your name, your nationality, your religion or lack of it.

These doesn’t mean anything to universe.

What matters is that “you” are part of a vast energy that spreads for billions of light years, and we don’t even know if this has an end. If it has, how…

None of us are actually separate lonely entities.

We are all linked somehow. 

And without referring any religion or deity, I do feel that we are the manifestation of something trying to understand itself.

Throw away acct bc my ex knows my UN on Reddit.

Backstory - 
I’m a 42y old woman with 2 kids (6m, 10f))

My husband of 15y died in 2020 after complications from a 5y battle
with non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. 

We’d met in high school, our families remain extremely close, and we had what I can only describe as a perfect relationship. He was my best friend and I was his - he set the bar extremely high.

When we knew his cancer was incurable my husband encouraged me to grieve but then move on and find a partner because in his words “I was an amazing partner” and he wanted our children to witness what love looked like.

I never imagined I’d date again - however last year, on the encouragement of our families and my therapist; I put myself out there.
I went on about a dozen first and second dates, I had a 5 month long relationship with a very nice man whom I just wasn’t ready for and it ended amicably.

I have been very upfront about my loss and re/entering the dating world, and met a great guy, whom I’ll call Greg, on Hinge in the late summer of 2023.

Greg is a 43y old single father with a 6y old son. Has a very stable job of 20+ years as a firefighter. Co-parents well 50-50 with his ex wife whom he split from due to her affair in 2021. 

He had 2 previous relationships after his split - one for 6 months with a young woman he knew wouldn’t go anywhere, and a second with a woman whom he’d dated out of high school - for approx 3 months who kept him “at arms length and wasn’t affectionate enough” for him to feel he had a connection with. We met 6 weeks after his last relationship.

It felt very organic from the get go. 

We had coffee for our first date and hit it off from the get go. Tons of laughs. Had our second date for dinner a few days later that went on for 6 hours at a local pub, 3rd the same week and by date 4 he stated he was deleting the apps and wanted to date me exclusively - that he hadn’t felt connection with anyone since he had met his wife back in his 20’s.

We spent a lot of time together - he’s a shift worker and I work half time during the day as a social worker by choice. My late husband was a high income earner and he had a substantial life insurance policy that has allowed my children and I a comfortable future.

Everything seemed great.
I met his son and family around the 2 month mark - and we hit it off. I met his ex wife at the 3 month mark and again, we hit it off. She was very happy that he’d met someone - I was the first person he’d introduced to his son - and she and I got along well (at this point she’s now engaged to her guy too)

Our relationship is great. We have tons of fun together. We had a great winter and spring - travelled as much as we could. Spent the summer at our family cottage with all the kids, our friends and his parents spent a ton of time with my family and my late husbands. He earned everyone’s approval. 
Zero red flags.

At the 6 month mark, he begins talking to me about marriage - would I ever want to marry again?
Would I ever want to live with someone again?

I was finally in a place where I could say yes. 
He talked at length with my parents about this - his parents too.

In September we started talking about logistics. Would he move into my home which was larger and could accommodate all of us? No. He felt uncomfortable about that - it was a house I shared with my late husband. 
We agreed to keep our respective properties and rent them out as income properties - and buy a home together. We made a list of our dream home. Budget. 

Things started to feel real, and exciting.
We booked an appt with the bank for late Oct to get mortgage approval.
We had a very frank talk about  marriage - and he told me he wanted to get married within a year and hoped I was on the same page. I was.

So we are now at 14m into our relationship.

The morning of our mortgage appt - he called to tell me he had tested positive for Covid - and that we’d have to reschedule. I reschedule for his next day off which was Nov 13th, a Wednesday.

On the 12th, the evening prior - we had a really nice dinner out - and went over everything that we needed for this appointment. It was a great night and the vibe was really happy and positive.

The next morning - just after getting the kids off to school - he brought me a coffee and said he needed to talk to me. 

I asked him what was up - I’d never seen him so serious. 
In this moment it was like something completely changed.

Tearfully he told me that he’d kept from me that he was nearly bankrupt.
When I asked him what he meant - he said that he’d made some poor choices post divorce with helium mining (still no idea what this is) day trading and sports betting and had incurred nearly 200k in debt since his divorce. That he was insolvent - and was making a proposal for a consumer debt relief.

I was absolutely shocked.
I did not react however and just let him talk. 
He told me he was embarrassed that he’d kept this from me and figured I would have left him had I known sooner. I was upset that this was a secret - but reassured him that I wasn’t going to leave - but that we needed to reexamine our priorities for the moment. He needed to deal with his debts first, and then we could plan our future. 

He agreed and said he felt a great deal of relief that he’d told me.

Things felt okay from this point on.
We met with a financial planner and the debt counsellor - they approved his debt relief plan and payback - and put him on a budget that would allow him to be debt free within 3 years.

We continued as normal and things felt positive.

In mid nov he proposed he move in with me - and we rent out his home to bring in some extra income to pay down his debt sooner - I agreed. The plan was for a move in date of Dec 1st. Today. The only caveat being that we both sign cohabitation agreements that neither of us have interest in each others debts, or shared properties. That any debts incurred from the time we begin cohabitating are to be on dual signature and anything outside of that are not the others responsibilities. He agreed however has delayed in signing the contract that was drawn up.

Everything else seemed on track. 

Last week Friday Greg texted me - insisting I invest 20k in the market via his day trading. I responded with a “?” - my father is a financial planner and his brokerage takes care of all of my investing. I reminded Greg of this, and said I appreciate his thinking of me though. 

He told me I was making a HUGE mistake because the market was about to take a turn and that 20k would be 200k within the week. I declined. He reiterated that I was making a bad decision and should listen to him. I reminded him that I let my dad’s brokerage handle my investments. He pushed again.
Finally I was frank and said that I felt like day trading felt a lot like gambling and wouldn’t place my money there as I’m cautious looking out for my future and my kids and then asked him if he was even allowed to participate in day trading with his consumer debt proposal (they had a great deal of stipulations of things he was not permitted to do, like incur more debt or gamble). He didn’t respond.

I was busy at work and just left it.

That afternoon I called him to see if he wanted to meet up for drinks after work as we usually did and he sent me to voice mail. 

I called him again a few hours later and received the same. 
I sent a text, asking him if we were meeting up and he left me on read.

I called and his phone was off.

I was pretty upset. Not once in our 16 months have I ever been ignored - nor have we ever really had a fight.

I figured I’d let him cool off and would hear from him Saturday. 
Silence.

Today - I reached out again asking if we could talk - and his response was “You obviously don’t trust me. This isn’t going to work. Take care”

I am gobsmacked.

I reached out to his mom whom I’ve been extremely close with and her response to me was that Greg has asked for his family not to communicate with me and mine, and instructed them to not get involved, to provide him with the space and time he needs to move on.

I feel sick to my stomach.

I realize there has to be MUCH more going on here than I was aware of. 
From a man’s perspective - can you tell me what I did wrong or did I dodge a huge bullet here like my dad assures me I did.

I absolutely love interacting with customers from around the world, and my coworkers make the job even better. Going to work is a privilege.

That said, things have changed since I got a new manager. At first, she was amazing—she joked about the company’s issues and she truly cares about me. But about four weeks ago, it changed. I think she’s extremely exhausted but my coworkers think she “got comfortable,” but now she’s started being mean “as a joke.” She talks trash about me and disrespects me to her close group of employees, then turns around and says she sees me like a son (which I believe). It’s confusing because on one hand, she can be supportive and protective, but on the other, her behavior feels hurtful and unprofessional. I think I've heard people say that she doesn't mean anything that she talks about.

For example, I recently switched to morning shifts after working nights for a while. On my first morning, I asked her if we were allowed to heat up pastries since it gets super busy, and she responded rudely. A customer overheard and later told me not to let anyone talk to me like that. But then a few hours later, when another customer gave me a hard time, she stepped in, asked if I was okay, and handled the situation for me. So I know she cares, but her behavior swings between extremes. She also makes inappropriate jokes and is often unreasonably mean to customers, which I think might be from exhaustion.

I don't want to stand up to her because I'm not confrontational like that I don't think that talking to her boss (or HR) will do anything... I don't have any leverage other than I would like to think that I'm a good worker (or at least have the potential). I'm just asking for basic respect, I know I'm not perfect at everything and I'm open to feedback if it's given in a professional manner. Most people think that she's hilarious and don't feel like it's hurtful that she acts like this. I feel like any effort to call her out publicly would feel like losing myself. I have had so many learning experiences with this job that it might be beneficial to just stay and go through the tough parts because I'll learn lessons on how to deal with these types of people and come out stronger? Or maybe I'm delusional.

I have had manager who made me and other people feel drained and unwelcome but (like now) I am still learning the ropes of what I should and should not do, what I can and cannot say, everyday I make mistakes and learn from them. I'm not saying it's all my managers' fault, I make mistakes but the way she approaches them doesn't make me feel respected.

I’m struggling because this is my first job, and I’m really grateful for it—the pay is amazing, and I love what I do most of the time. But it’s hard to be on the receiving end of her behavior, even if it’s not constant. My job is already exhaustive and I don't want to drain me more but it's been on my mind for weeks. I don’t know if I’m overthinking things or if it’s fair to feel the way I feel. I've heard the service industry is just like this in general, people trash talk each other all the time but it's like she's the leader of a gossiping teenage girl group. I have hope that maybe another coffee shop would be different (outside the airport), the only thing to consider is that one day I do want to work in airport operations and having this job might teach me a lot about how an airport operates (I learn so much about life in general too everyday at my job) so IDK if it's worth it to stick it out (maybe she might leave one day). Any advice on how to handle this would mean so much to me.

Thank you so much!",2,1733105732.0,workplace_bullying,2,1.0,False

Backstory - 
I’m a 42y old woman with 2 kids (6m, 10f))

My husband of 15y died in 2020 after complications from a 5y battle
with non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. 

We’d met in high school, our families remain extremely close, and we had what I can only describe as a perfect relationship. He was my best friend and I was his - he set the bar extremely high.

When we knew his cancer was incurable my husband encouraged me to grieve but then move on and find a partner because in his words “I was an amazing partner” and he wanted our children to witness what love looked like.

I never imagined I’d date again - however last year, on the encouragement of our families and my therapist; I put myself out there.
I went on about a dozen first and second dates, I had a 5 month long relationship with a very nice man whom I just wasn’t ready for and it ended amicably.

I have been very upfront about my loss and re/entering the dating world, and met a great guy, whom I’ll call Greg, on Hinge in the late summer of 2023.

Greg is a 43y old single father with a 6y old son. Has a very stable job of 20+ years as a firefighter. Co-parents well 50-50 with his ex wife whom he split from due to her affair in 2021. 

He had 2 previous relationships after his split - one for 6 months with a young woman he knew wouldn’t go anywhere, and a second with a woman whom he’d dated out of high school - for approx 3 months who kept him “at arms length and wasn’t affectionate enough” for him to feel he had a connection with. We met 6 weeks after his last relationship.

It felt very organic from the get go. 

We had coffee for our first date and hit it off from the get go. Tons of laughs. Had our second date for dinner a few days later that went on for 6 hours at a local pub, 3rd the same week and by date 4 he stated he was deleting the apps and wanted to date me exclusively - that he hadn’t felt connection with anyone since he had met his wife back in his 20’s.

We spent a lot of time together - he’s a shift worker and I work half time during the day as a social worker by choice. My late husband was a high income earner and he had a substantial life insurance policy that has allowed my children and I a comfortable future.

Everything seemed great.
I met his son and family around the 2 month mark - and we hit it off. I met his ex wife at the 3 month mark and again, we hit it off. She was very happy that he’d met someone - I was the first person he’d introduced to his son - and she and I got along well (at this point she’s now engaged to her guy too)

Our relationship is great. We have tons of fun together. We had a great winter and spring - travelled as much as we could. Spent the summer at our family cottage with all the kids, our friends and his parents spent a ton of time with my family and my late husbands. He earned everyone’s approval. 
Zero red flags.

At the 6 month mark, he begins talking to me about marriage - would I ever want to marry again?
Would I ever want to live with someone again?

I was finally in a place where I could say yes. 
He talked at length with my parents about this - his parents too.

In September we started talking about logistics. Would he move into my home which was larger and could accommodate all of us? No. He felt uncomfortable about that - it was a house I shared with my late husband. 
We agreed to keep our respective properties and rent them out as income properties - and buy a home together. We made a list of our dream home. Budget. 

Things started to feel real, and exciting.
We booked an appt with the bank for late Oct to get mortgage approval.
We had a very frank talk about  marriage - and he told me he wanted to get married within a year and hoped I was on the same page. I was.

So we are now at 14m into our relationship.

The morning of our mortgage appt - he called to tell me he had tested positive for Covid - and that we’d have to reschedule. I reschedule for his next day off which was Nov 13th, a Wednesday.

On the 12th, the evening prior - we had a really nice dinner out - and went over everything that we needed for this appointment. It was a great night and the vibe was really happy and positive.

The next morning - just after getting the kids off to school - he brought me a coffee and said he needed to talk to me. 

I asked him what was up - I’d never seen him so serious. 
In this moment it was like something completely changed.

Tearfully he told me that he’d kept from me that he was nearly bankrupt.
When I asked him what he meant - he said that he’d made some poor choices post divorce with helium mining (still no idea what this is) day trading and sports betting and had incurred nearly 200k in debt since his divorce. That he was insolvent - and was making a proposal for a consumer debt relief.

I was absolutely shocked.
I did not react however and just let him talk. 
He told me he was embarrassed that he’d kept this from me and figured I would have left him had I known sooner. I was upset that this was a secret - but reassured him that I wasn’t going to leave - but that we needed to reexamine our priorities for the moment. He needed to deal with his debts first, and then we could plan our future. 

He agreed and said he felt a great deal of relief that he’d told me.

Things felt okay from this point on.
We met with a financial planner and the debt counsellor - they approved his debt relief plan and payback - and put him on a budget that would allow him to be debt free within 3 years.

We continued as normal and things felt positive.

In mid nov he proposed he move in with me - and we rent out his home to bring in some extra income to pay down his debt sooner - I agreed. The plan was for a move in date of Dec 1st. Today. The only caveat being that we both sign cohabitation agreements that neither of us have interest in each others debts, or shared properties. That any debts incurred from the time we begin cohabitating are to be on dual signature and anything outside of that are not the others responsibilities. He agreed however has delayed in signing the contract that was drawn up.

Everything else seemed on track. 

Last week Friday Greg texted me - insisting I invest 20k in the market via his day trading. I responded with a “?” - my father is a financial planner and his brokerage takes care of all of my investing. I reminded Greg of this, and said I appreciate his thinking of me though. 

He told me I was making a HUGE mistake because the market was about to take a turn and that 20k would be 200k within the week. I declined. He reiterated that I was making a bad decision and should listen to him. I reminded him that I let my dad’s brokerage handle my investments. He pushed again.
Finally I was frank and said that I felt like day trading felt a lot like gambling and wouldn’t place my money there as I’m cautious looking out for my future and my kids and then asked him if he was even allowed to participate in day trading with his consumer debt proposal (they had a great deal of stipulations of things he was not permitted to do, like incur more debt or gamble). He didn’t respond.

I was busy at work and just left it.

That afternoon I called him to see if he wanted to meet up for drinks after work as we usually did and he sent me to voice mail. 

I called him again a few hours later and received the same. 
I sent a text, asking him if we were meeting up and he left me on read.

I called and his phone was off.

I was pretty upset. Not once in our 16 months have I ever been ignored - nor have we ever really had a fight.

I figured I’d let him cool off and would hear from him Saturday. 
Silence.

Today - I reached out again asking if we could talk - and his response was “You obviously don’t trust me. This isn’t going to work. Take care”

I am gobsmacked.

I reached out to his mom whom I’ve been extremely close with and her response to me was that Greg has asked for his family not to communicate with me and mine, and instructed them to not get involved, to provide him with the space and time he needs to move on.

I feel sick to my stomach.

I realize there has to be MUCH more going on here than I was aware of. 
From a man’s perspective - can you tell me what I did wrong or did I dodge a huge bullet here like my dad assures me I did.
