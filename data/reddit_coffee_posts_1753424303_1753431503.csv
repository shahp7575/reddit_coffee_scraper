Halfway through my shower, the doorbell rang.  
  
I ignored it. It rang again.  
  
I stepped out of the bathroom and opened the door to find a girl standing outside.  
  
""I'm your new neighbor. I left something at your place—mind if I grab it real quick?""  
  
Before I could agree, she rushed straight to my room, pulled out a pair of lace panties from under my fiancé's pillow, and said with a flushed face:  
  
""My water got cut off yesterday, and I was desperate, so I came over to use your shower. Hope you don't mind.""  
  
She left with her underwear, and I slumped back onto my couch in a daze.  
  
After sitting there for what felt like forever, I finally got up—only to feel something weird under the cushions.  
  
I pulled it out and instantly hurled it across the room—it was a goddamn used condom?!  
  
Bile shot up my throat.  
  
I couldn't hold it back anymore. I bolted to the bathroom and threw up until I was seeing stars.  
  
I was so out of it that I didn't even notice when Rhett came home and found me there.  
  
""Wren, babe, what's wrong?""  
  
The concern in his eyes looked genuine enough. He helped me to my feet, his hand steady on my shoulder.  
  
""What happened? Should I take you to the hospital?""  
  
I stared at his face—not a single crack in that perfect mask.  
  
Doubt began creeping into my mind—was I being too paranoid?  
  
A pair of underwear and a used condom didn't necessarily mean anything.  
  
Maybe it was all a misunderstanding.  
  
Maybe I was just being crazy.  
  
My eyes were bloodshot as Rhett helped me onto the couch. I wrapped my hands around the warm water he'd brought me and shook my head.  
  
""I'm fine. Probably just caught a chill last night.""  
  
Rhett and I had been inseparable since we were kids.  
  
I shouldn't be doubting twenty-five years of history between us.  
  
I shouldn't be tearing down the walls of trust we'd built together over some stupid paranoia.  
  
I pulled myself together and gave him a reassuring smile. ""Really, I'm okay. Don't worry about it.""  
  
Our wedding was just around the corner.  
  
Nobody wants their relationship to fall apart right before their big day—including me.  
  
Rhett gently stroked my hair and said, ""Let me make you some vegetable soup.""  
  
I nodded, watching his retreating figure with a warm feeling in my chest.  
  
Right as I was scrolling through TikTok, waiting for the soup, the doorbell rang again.  
  
I stayed put on the couch and heard Rhett call out:  
  
""Wren, can you get that? I'm kinda tied up here.""  
  
I glanced toward the kitchen where he was locked in battle with some hairy crabs.  
  
I laughed and went to open the door, only to find that same neighbor girl standing outside.  
  
She scratched her head sheepishly. ""I didn't cook tonight. Mind if I crash your dinner?""  
  
The apartment across the hall had been empty for two years. Suddenly there's a new neighbor, and I had no clue about it?  
  
What kind of person moves in and immediately shows up asking for free meals?  
  
I was about to tell her no when she looped her arm through mine and held up a cup of bubble tea.  
  
""I brought boba! The more the merrier, right? And don't worry—I'll totally take your trash away when I leave!""  
  
She didn't give me a chance to refuse, practically dragging me back inside.  
  
As the same time, Rhett emerged from the kitchen carrying a bowl of soup, smiling as he asked:  
  
""Who was it?""  
  
When he saw the neighbor girl's face, his expression went stone cold.  
  
She chirped up playfully: ""Hey there, Rhett! I'm here to mooch some food. Your girlfriend invited me—hope that's cool?""  
  
Rhett's gaze shifted to me.  
  
I didn't bother sugarcoating it. ""I never did that.""  
  
I yanked my arm free from the neighbor's grip. Pointing at the bubble tea, I said to Rhett, ""Looks like you've been having a grand time while I was away.""  
  
I'm not the type to suffer in silence.  
  
There's no way Rhett couldn't see this girl had ulterior motives.  
  
Maybe he was waiting for me to give him an out—waiting for me to say, ""Yeah, I totally invited her over for dinner.""  
  
But I didn't want to.  
  
I locked eyes with him, demanding an answer.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Just like when we were kids and someone tried to come between us, Rhett would always say the same thing:  
  
""In this whole wide world, Wren comes first. Of course I'm choosing Wren.""  
  
I looked at Rhett, then at the neighbor girl, whose eyes were suddenly welling up with tears. She slammed the bubble tea down on the table and snapped:  
  
""I seriously didn't mean anything by it! My power and water got cut off yesterday, so I came over to use your shower. I just wanted to thank you guys today—that's why I brought the boba!""  
  
Her tears started streaming down.  
  
""Do you really have to give me the cold shoulder like this?""  
  
I still didn't respond. I kept my eyes locked on Rhett. He rubbed his temples, then walked over to the table, picked up the bubble tea, and handed it back to her.  
  
""My girlfriend doesn't mess around. Letting you in yesterday was my mistake. You should go.""  
  
The neighbor broke down even harder. ""We didn't do anything! Why is she acting like I'm some homewrecker?""  
  
She made it sound like I was the one in the wrong.  
  
But that condom on my couch, and the red hair I'd found—it was the exact same shade as this neighbor girl's.  
  
I had no idea when Rhett, who usually kept strangers at arm's length, had become so generous that he'd let some random person into our home. Into our bathroom, no less.  
  
A guy and a girl alone together. Who knows what could happen?  
  
The neighbor turned her tear-streaked face toward me.  
  
""I was just trying to be nice! You're the one with a dirty mind, so of course everything looks dirty to you! I just moved in—I don't want drama with my neighbors, but you're being way too much!""  
  
By all logic, Rhett had asked her to leave. If she had any shame, she would've walked out. But she kept standing there, putting on a show. For whose benefit?  
  
I looked at her, completely unmoved by her guilt trip.  
  
""Fine. I'm being too much.""  
  
I threw the door wide open.  
  
""Please leave!""  
  
This time, the neighbor couldn't stick around. She stamped her foot and ran out crying. The apartment fell dead silent. Rhett gave me a look that said he was at his wit's end.  
  
""Wren, don't you think you went too far?""  
  
Rhett and I had been inseparable since we were in diapers. When we were seventeen, Rhett bought up every firework in the entire city just to get me to agree to be his girlfriend, confessing his love under that dazzling display of lights.  
  
""Wren, do you want to date me with marriage and growing old together as our endgame?""  
  
I looked at my boy, trembling as he poured his heart out, and threw myself into his arms with tears in my eyes.  
  
Our relationship had been smooth sailing ever since. Everyone envied me for having such a perfect childhood-friend-turned-fiancé.  
  
And now, here he was, taking some random girl's side against me.  
  
""You know how important reputation is to a girl. What you just said could get her labeled as a homewrecker!""  
  
""Wren,"" Rhett walked past me, deliberately bumping my shoulder hard enough to make me stumble back. ""I was just trying to save your face, but that doesn't mean I think you were right.""  
  
With that, He stormed out, leaving me alone with the lingering smell of soup.  
  
Was I wrong?  
  
Had I messed up?  
  
When I was spiraling into self-doubt, my phone buzzed with a friend request notification.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
My heart skipped a beat as I saw videos from an unknown sender.  
  
In the footage, Rhett was sitting on our couch with the neighbor girl, helping her blow out candles on a cake. His voice was sickeningly sweet:  
  
""Happy Valentine's Day, babe.""  
  
They kissed passionately.  
  
They did the most intimate things imaginable in my apartment.  
  
They were going at it in my bathtub, water sloshing everywhere like my heart was being dragged through broken glass, blood seeping from every wound. I watched the neighbor girl laugh brightly, making cute poses with Rhett for the camera.  
  
""Today's me and Rhett's first Valentine's Day together! We're gonna have so many more!""  
  
She asked him with a giggle: ""Will living next door to you cause problems?""  
  
Rhett's face was flushed with alcohol as he pulled her closer.  
  
""Nah. Wren and I go way back—she'd never suspect a thing. If I'm choosing to be with you, I'll protect you.""  
  
The video cut to the present, showing the girl crying while Rhett held and comforted her: ""Wren's just blunt—she cares too much about me. Don't take it personally!""  
  
""I promise I won't touch Wren anymore!""  
  
""I'll save myself for you.""  
  
The girl sobbed in his arms: ""But she saw right through me! I was just standing there, and she already hated me.""  
  
""I wasn't trying to cause trouble—I just wanted to see you, babe.""  
  
""What did I do wrong to deserve this?""  
  
I watched Rhett's face fill with sympathy as he soothed her: ""Don't worry. I'll spend the next few days with you.""  
  
The video ended abruptly.  
  
A message followed: \[Wren, think your wedding's still happening on schedule?\]  
  
My fingers went numb.  
  
The trembling crawled from my fingertips through my entire body until even my teeth were chattering. The love I'd been so proud of, the man I'd trusted completely, had just delivered the truth in the cruelest possible way.  
  
I forced myself to breathe to stay sane. I saved all the evidence and sent it to my best friend:  
  
\[Rhett and I are done.\]  
  
When I was sixteen, I caught my dad cheating with his secretary. When I confronted him through my tears, asking why he'd do this to us, he just threatened me not to tell my mom. He was so sure Mom would fall apart if she knew the truth.  
  
I didn't believe him. I ran to my mother, crying as I told her about Dad's betrayal.  
  
Later, my mom really did jump from our apartment balcony.  
  
I never had a mother again.  
  
That summer, I lost my mom and my dad. I became an outsider, shuffled between relatives who took me in out of obligation.  
  
Rhett was the one who stayed with me through it all.  
  
Rhett was the one who told me with absolute certainty:  
  
""Wren, even if you lose everything else, you'll always have me.""  
  
Now, Rhett—I don't have you anymore either.  
  
I sat like a zombie in the coffee shop, watching my best friend point at the girl in the video and curse: ""This basic bitch isn't even that pretty! How the hell did she catch Rhett's eye? Remember when the actual school beauty was chasing him, and he wouldn't even look at her twice! How did he turn into this?""  
  
My friend got more worked up as she ranted, finally slamming her hand on the table.  
  
""I'm gonna find that bastard!""  
  
""This is such bullshit!""  
  
""That homewrecker basically moved in next door to mess with you—there's no way we're taking this lying down!""

It took me a long time, but I finally decided to start diving into the Gridfinity world, and oh boy, it's amazing!

I had a particular use case for it. I have a bunch of Dolce Gusto coffee capsules that were just laying around in a drawer, and sometimes it was a pain to find the right capsule when I needed. So I thought this might be the perfect case for a gridfinity project :)

Then, I made 4 different designs. One that can hold 4 capsules, another that can hold 2 capsules, and lastly two different sized bins to toss the capsules that were not being currently ""displayed"" (Basically something to use in the back of my drawer).

But there's also this tiny flicker of light sometimes, like dawn just trying to peek through, ya know? I've been reminding myself that loneliness isn't some sorta personal failing or anything. It's this universal thing we all face at different times, like feeling cold or hungry.

Idk, maybe it’s just me, but when I pause and kinda just sit with that thought, it makes me feel less... isolated, I guess? We're all doing this human thing, and it'd be strange if we didn't feel lonely sometimes.

Problem was, most cold press juicers are either gigantic or cost more than my weekly grocery budget(im a college student btw).

I checked walmart and target but god the stuff there is expensive af so i came back to good old amazon lol. Found [this compact kind](https://videoguidelines.com/dp-B0DGTS3M73) from inoviva and it lowkey surprised me compared to most others I saw. It’s small like fits-in-a-tote small but the blades do the job way better than I'd expect from that price. (huge plus: it comes in the prettiest pink shade)

Also a side note, I had a mini juicer back when I started college and thought it’d be enough, but it was way too compact to make a good serving. Ended up juicing 3x just to fill one glass. So I learned my lesson, juicer needs to be compact but still big enough to give a full big glass.

Compared to my last, here's what i think is better in this one:

* compact and lightweight, works well for small kitchens or carrying it around
* 70 rpm slow juicing so it doesn’t kill nutrients (less foamy juice too)-very important imo
* barely any pulp waste
* easy to clean, everything clicks apart (and dishwasher safe)

Not saying it’s going to outdo a $300 nama juicer, but for the price (under $40), it’s honestly a great intro if you’re just starting with juicing or want something portable for travel, small spaces, or even dorm life.",1,1753430787.0,Nutrition_Healthy,0,1.0,False

Super bait niya rin to the point na kahit anong ibato kong salita, titikom lang bibig niyan tas ihug ako.

Context: 1st year college kami pareho nung naging kami. Dati binigyan njya ako ng flower tas sabi ko wag muna kasi students pa lang kami eh. Sa first 7 months ng relationship namin, it was so ideal. He’s from the city and ako nagrerenta lang near the school. Every after class, he’ll come to me and we cuddle, play valorant sa computer shop, then uuwi siya around 9 or 10 na ng gabi. Months later nagstop ako ng school to work sa CC for the mean time. Siya rin merong job, video editor at night and both kami are earning decent amount. Then one time I said, since we’re both earning naman, I honestly told him na gusto ko makareceive ng flowers on special days like birthdays, monthsary ganun ba. And nagsawa na ako sa set up namin ng yung date namin ay puro comshop lang. One year mahigit na kami that time and I also opened up na we haven’t tried cine together, museum date, picnic date, world of fun date sa sm, yung mag picture inside the studio, and even coffee shop date. So ako meron talaga akong parang checklist ba na gusto ko i-try namin as a couple. Very vocal talaga ako sa gusto ko. But the problem is, after ko sabihin yun syempre I expected na sa susunod na monthsary baka may ganap kami, pero dumating ang 2 motmot namin na wala talaga. Eat out lang, minsan wala pa to the point na nagagalit ako. Ang gusto ko kasi ay i-surprise niya ako without me constantly asking for it. Yung cycle namin parang ganito: 2024 to ha
April - (anniversary) no flowers
May - I opened it up and he acknowledged
June - Wala na naman
July - I got mad for constantly bringing it up.

Yung dating kasi sa akin saka lang siya kikilos pag nagagalit na ako. Last February sinabihan ko na naman siya ulit yung about sa dates. Same cycle lang din nung sa itaas. Ako kasi yung tipo ng tao na if overjoyed ako sa surprise mo without me asking for it, ibabalik ko yan sayo ng 3 times. To be honest ang toxic na. Palagi na lang ako naga-ask for it.

My doctor had told me that 1/4 end up not having a period and that sounded good to me, but the first period lasted 23 days, the next 43, so I quickly knew that I wouldn’t be the 1/4. I kept using the pills and like 6 months in my boyfriend started noticing that I was forgetting what I was in the middle of and ended up moving on to other tasks. 
9 months in the brainfog had taken over as well as extreme exhaustion and we decided together that I’d contact the doctor to find another solution -especially since I was still spotting to often and my periods had settled at like 7 days of bleeding, 3 days break and then 6-9 more days afterwards 🫣

So I switched to the combined pill (Microgyn) though my doctor had preferred an IUD -I just wasn’t ready for that mentally. 
The fatigue and brain fog got way better and I honestly stopped noticing it. One problem though: I’m a type 1 diabetic and apparently a side effect of this pill is “glucose intolerance” as in my blood sugars were constantly high and very hard to get down -so again, I was exhausted and as a bonus I still had a ton of spotting between periods(though they’d settled around 6 day periods as before hormones). 
After 8 months my boyfriend and I decided I should just stop and then we’d use condoms(which we had also done while on Cerazette because I didn’t trust it) until I could get the IUD at a gynaecologist.

I was without any hormones for nearly 3 months, my blood sugars returned to normal almost instantly and I just felt great. This was when my boyfriend told me that I’d still been “foggy” while on Microgyn(which I hadn’t really noticed as I just felt the improvement compared to Cerazette) and now I wasn’t 😊
Condoms are kinda boring when used to not using them, so I was kinda looking forward to getting the IUD as my doctor had said it shouldn’t cause exhaustion since it’s “only local in the uterus”

The insertion went way better than feared and the gyno had recommended I’d take 2 500mg paracetamol and 200mg ibuprofen beforehand. Other than that she sprayed my cervix with a numbing solution and told me to take deep breaths and relax. She measured my uterus and went for the Kyleena due to size and the fact that I haven’t given birth. Inversion went well! Just a quick cramp across my stomach and that was it! 🤩 had some mild cramping for the rest of the day so I took some painkillers and spotted for a few days. 
About two months in I started really noticing the tiredness and brainfog again, but was told it would be up to 6 months before my body would’ve settled, so I soldiered on 🫣
When to my doctor to get blood work done due to the exhaustion, but everything was normal (vitamin D in the low end, but still way above the minimum). My work(at a pharmacy) was affected by my exhaustion and brainfog again fog, and I started losing my train of thought in the middle of a sentence as well as saying numbers in the wrong order 🫣 was also asked by a costumer if I was a foreigner as the order of my sentences started messing up a bit and I’ve just felt like I’m more stupid than I am 🫣
I contacted the gyno about removal, but they aren’t allowed to do anything before the doctor had sent a referral. I then tried to get the doctor to do that, but they wanted to see me first(three week wait 😭) and the doctor then was busy telling me that it can’t be the IUD as it’s “only local” but maybe it was my vitamin D as it was in the low end 🤦🏽‍♀️ she told me to take 50 micrograms of D3 for 3 month and see if it changed anything. In the end I got the referral, but due to the summer holiday I had to wait a month for the removal.
I took the D3 for that whole month and nothing has improved.

Just had the Kyleena removed two days ago after having it in for 8 months. And already I have more energy! 
The removal was surprisingly quick! Took the same painkillers as the first time and again she’d sprayed my cervix. She asked me to cough into my elbow once and as I did she yanked it out. I was shocked and asked her “was that it” 🤭 I had decided that I was done with hormones, so I had a copper IUD inserted at the same time. Apparently my uterus had decided to turn backwards this time, so it took two attempts to get it in. First failed and she asked me to put my fist under my tailbone to change the angle and it worked like a charm 😊 there was so much blood this time(first time I didn’t even see it on the chair) but still only a mild cramp when she went in there 😊

The day after at work one of my colleagues commented that I seemed more relaxed and energetic than when we worked together the day before removal 😁 
Today, two days later, I rolled out of bed just before my boyfriend for the first time in months and went to make him coffee and scrambled eggs 🤩 I have this odd feeling of being free -like how I’ve felt when travelling for a longer period of time, so I have high hopes for the future 🥰☀️

TLDR: tried progesterone only pill -bad!. Tried combined pill -bad!. Tried kyleena -bad! And now I’m looking forward to get myself back 🤭",1,1753430222.0,birthcontrol,1,1.0,False

Some of you will remember this as the Twelve Dares of Christmas (Barbara was originally Barbara Christmas) but of course, it was incorrectly giving Xmas vibes.

What do we think of the new title?

Also completely changed up my first chapter to start us in the middle of the action, rather than Babs' funeral.

Any feedback much appreciated.

Dear Agent

THE TWELVE DARES OF BARBARA WILDE is a warm and humorous upmarket women’s fiction set in a small British town, complete at 70,000 words. It will appeal to readers who enjoyed the life-affirming choices of The Midnight Library by Matt Haig, and the emotional mischief of The Authenticity Project by Clare Pooley.

Larger than life Barbara 'Babs' Wilde may be gone, but she's still causing havoc from beyond the grave. Before she died, she left her six closest friends a challenge: twelve dares, one for each month of the coming year. Expect public humiliation, accidental nudity, and a group of fifty- and sixty-somethings stuffing money into thongs at a male strip show.

Why? Because Babs wanted them to remember what it feels like to truly live - not just survive. To laugh like they used to, take risks, and say the things they’ve never dared to say. To fall back in love - with life, with each other, and with themselves. They’ve forgotten how. And she plans to fix that.

Each woman faces a crossroads: a widow who’s lost her joy; a firecracker hiding a health scare; a devoted carer overwhelmed by her husband’s decline; a mother estranged from her daughter; an artist who’s lost her confidence; and the chaotic heart of the group masking chronic pain.

Together, they throw parties for strangers, take belly dancing lessons, and crash a stranger’s wedding pretending to be long-lost cousins from Cork. They laugh. They fight. They push each other out of their comfort zones.
  
But as the dares grow more personal, so do the stakes. Old wounds resurface. Relationships fracture. And when a hidden truth about Babs comes to light, the women must decide: will they finish what she started - or fall apart trying?

Thanks

First 300 (the dares should be italicised but not working on mobile)

Chaper 1: The Letter.

December: On Christmas day, go skinny dipping. Sorry, not sorry.

Maggie’s voice died. She looked up from the piece of paper in her hands to find five pairs of eyes staring at her in horror.

Pat’s teacup rattled against her saucer. ‘Is she mental? Skinny dipping? At Christmas? My bits haven’t seen daylight since 1993.’

‘Oh she’s serious,’ Ellie grabbed the wine bottle from the sideboard. ‘Keep reading, Maggie.’

January: Attend a male strip show. Front row, no flinching.

Joan walked to the window and pressed her head against the cold glass. The thought of all that exposed flesh was threatening a hot flush.

February: Spend the night in a haunted house. Maybe I’ll see you there.

Dot’s thermos – which definitely wasn’t tea – hit the coffee table harder than necessary. ‘Yep. She’d definitely lost it.’

‘Oh, she lost it in 1982,’ Ellie said, grinning. ‘This is the encore.’

March: Host my living funeral. Speeches, wine, wigs. No blubbing.

Silence. Just the reverberating tick of Maggie’s grandfather clock. The sound seemed to be louder than usual – maybe Babs reminding them of their mortality.

Sylvie picked up the list and started laughing. Not a giggle – proper, doubled-over, gasping laughter. ‘Belly dancing?’ she wheezed. ‘Can you imagine?’

‘I’d rather not, love. I’ve just eaten,’ Ellie teased.

‘Cheeky moo. At least the veils will cover our faces. There’s more. Flash mobs. Stand-up comedy. Crash a wedding?’ She looked horrified.

‘We’ll be arrested.’ Joan sighed.

Ellie poured wine for everyone, including a triple for herself. ‘We could film it all. Be TikTok famous.’

Laughter erupted. Desperate, grief-mad laughter that had been building since the funeral two days ago.

Because they’d just said goodbye to Barbara Wilde. And even in death, she was still a menace.

Because of that I avoided sweets and sugar like the plague my whole life. I don't ever put sugar in my tea & coffee since I was young. Avoided ice cream, candy and cake because I didn't want to get diabetes. As I got older I exercised, I walk 10 to 20k steps a day. I always eat salads for lunch, eggs for breakfast, canned sardines, tuna, almonds for snacks, overall a mediteranean diet....

I did bloodwork this week, last time I did bloodwork my A1C was 4.5, two years ago. I got my results back yesterday and my A1C is 8 and my cholesterol is almost 300 :'(

Curse genetics. I have no idea wtf to do. I already follow a healthy lifestyle, everyone is scratching their head. People in my family that are obese don't even have diabetes. I was the last person expected to get this. I weigh 175 and am called a skinny legend for God's sake. Does this mean I have to go on a liquid diet? 

My doctor is not taking it seriously either. Which is why I will switch them immidiatly. But they want me to do the bloodwork again just to make sure the lab didn't mix my stuff with someone else (i hope so). But honestly if not... im terrified. 

Like I didnt have the signs of increased thirst, frequent urination, or anything. I just feel normal. But the fact my fasted glucose was 165. Wtf bruh. I blame genetics. Genetics is a lottery that is not fair :/

we both have jobs. we’re not rich or anything but we’re definitely capable of taking turns or going half and half. it’s not really about the money. it’s more about how it feels when someone never thinks to offer. like the idea of sharing that responsibility never even crosses his mind.

The only way to get paid more is to take another position with tips, but that'd require me to be more social, and my battery is on reserves as it is. I've worked here for a year and 7 months, and I don't think anyone here really likes me, not more than a reliable coworker anyway. I only have 2 friends in the whole wode world, but our relationships basically only consist of the occasional meme sending and even more rare sharing of a funny story. I feel incredibly lonely, I don't know how to make friends, I can barely converse with customers, or even my managers, and my parents tell me to go out more but I know that people I'd want to be friends with would definitely not be at bars or coffee shops just waiting for someone like me to walk up and bother them. If I quit my job tomorrow, I think my managers worry about replacing me would very highly outweigh their sadness at me leaving, hell I'd feel if I died tonight they'd still feel that way. I had one coworker I was somewhat close with, but now they seem embarrassed to even look at me. I recently told 4/5 of my managers I was autistic, and one of them treats me a bit differently, like they're a bit ""overly-considerate,"" if that makes sense, but it could have been a lot worse. I didn't tell 1 of my managers because I don't like them, they're the one who always comes to give me bad news, and last year I was very excited for Halloween and she was the one I was talking to about ideas but she never did anything. She got a $200 budget for decoration, and never got anything, I had to buy decorations out of my own pocket and do the front desk myself which I wasn't too upset about, but on November 2nd she walked in with a Christmas tree, need I say more? I was attempting to get closer with another of my coworkers who I've known as long as I've worked here, but when I asked her to go see Superman she left me on seen, and she kind of lied to me about another thing which is kind of a stupid thing, but I just hate lying, I can't explain how much I hate it when someone lies even about something so... Meaningless, I can't look at them the same and I haven't dared speak to them, but neither have they, and now I genuinely feel regret for telling them that I'm autistic. I took a break from my therapist about a month and a half ago, I used to see her about three times a month, and I've been feeling more and more depressed lately, nothing has really helped. Work hasn't helped at all, my Mom asked if I could switch to the morning shifts so she could see me more, but I have to clock in at 9:30, and lately I've been severely struggling with sleep, some nights I lay with my eyes shut for hours just to not sleep up until 5 or 6 AM. I'm used to writing a lot, it's my passion, I want to be a filmmaker one day, but this past week it has been getting harder and harder to find something to write about, even just to fill a page. My brother has been increasingly distant, which saddens me, and I hate his friends who are over all the time now, so I feel trapped in my room. It's currently 12:35 AM and they still haven't left. I wrote my coworker a letter saying I feel like everyone at work hates me sometimes, she responded with a note saying that nobody hates me, that people like me and are actually excited to see what I'll do for Halloween since I went all out last year. I wish those coworkers would tell me, I wish it were true, that I believed in it, but I absolutely don't believe anyone likes me. I think if my funeral were 2 weeks from now that only my Mom, Dad, and grandparents would show up. My brother would prefer to have the house to himself, my aunt and uncle wouldn't be able to fit it in their schedules, so my cousins wouldn't come either, none of my coworkers would even notice or care or miss me, and my 2 friends would probably have just stopped sending me memes assuming I ghosted them or something... That's not a pun by the way. I know nobody's probably gonna read any of this, let alone all of it, I wouldn't be surprised if this post got taken down, I just needed this slightest of releases, because I'm tired of it all.

Failed sheep dog (apparently herding on command is a key part of working dog life 🤷‍♀️) anyway, she’s very obedient, came with all basic commands and solid recall, for a collie she’s fairly chill (when a ball toy or sticks aren’t involved) she chills out with my in-laws labXcollie during the day when I’m working and can’t have her with me, and in the evenings she in the lap of luxury living indoor dog life and when she’s indoor she’s happy to sit in her bed or at the foot of the couch on the floor,,, demanding pets when she’s gets the chance. All to say she’s a great dog would contemplate another. Only the odd bit of chewing/destructive activity if we skipped two days without walks which we don’t do. 
The morning routine is, partner lets her out of her crate, and she chills in her bed in the sitting room. For the last 12mts + no issues.  But for the last 1-2weeks? Every morning she’s has my shoe slipper etc. this morning she had a party chew up bits from my tote bag knocked over jug of water on the coffee table and going off the dog hair had a nap/party of the couch. After the 1st morning I stopped leaving my slippers around the house, the 2nd I made sure all shoes were gathered and secured behind a door, which helped for one morning and this morning locked into the sitting room she found more of my things to chew (never my partners 🥲) 

So is this just her way of saying hey I need more exercise mental stimulation? Nothing has really changed in the last few weeks. I don’t understand. She was happy out in the morning for the last year and now every morning I dread to see how she’s outsmarted me to ruin my things? 

In the short term it looks like she’ll be crated longer until I leave for work and will miss out on her morning freedom. But I don’t know what else to do? I don’t catch her on the act so it’s hard to say no, but also hard not to say anything. ",2,1753429689.0,BorderCollie,0,1.0,False

Then one hours later, I get a “quick sync” invite with my manager and someone from HR I’d never seen before.

No warning.

They said my role was being eliminated. Budget realignment. Effective immediately.

Slack disconnected while I was still on the call. I had 48 hours to return the laptop.

And while I was still sitting there, stunned, my phone kept buzzing with birthday wishes from coworkers, most of whom didn’t even know I’d just been let go.

The same people calling me “family” that morning had removed me like a checkbox on a spreadsheet by afternoon.

Some teammates pushed back, asked questions. No one from leadership addressed it.

I posted on LinkedIn later:

## What is Model Lonox Hex?

Model Lonox Hex is an **automated trading platform** that claims to use AI and advanced algorithms to help users trade cryptocurrencies and other financial assets more efficiently. Think of it like having a personal crypto bot that trades on your behalf based on market signals and pre-set strategies.

The platform is designed for both beginners and pros. If you're new, great—pick a strategy and let the system do the work. If you're experienced, you can tweak settings and play around with manual controls. It covers assets like **Bitcoin, Ethereum, forex pairs**, and even commodities like gold.

In short, Model Lonox Hex is trying to make trading **more accessible** and **less stressful**, without needing a PhD in finance.

## Who Created Model Lonox Hex?

There isn’t a ton of public info about the actual creators of Model Lonox Hex, which is kind of standard in the world of automated trading platforms. What we do know is that it was allegedly developed by a team of **financial analysts, software developers, and AI engineers** who’ve worked on similar tools before.

This lack of transparency might raise an eyebrow, but again, it’s not uncommon. Platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge** also operate under similar anonymity. What matters more is how the platform performs and whether it delivers on its promises—and so far, the feedback and functionality seem pretty legit.

Even though there’s no standalone app, the browser version is mobile-optimized. I traded from my phone while waiting for coffee, and it worked just fine. Charts, buttons, and notifications are all responsive on smaller screens.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up alerts for specific price movements, trade confirmations, or volatility spikes. This keeps you in the loop without being glued to the screen all day. It’s a nice touch, especially if you want to semi-automate your trading.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Beyond crypto, Model Lonox Hex supports **forex pairs, stocks, and commodities**. This makes it a good all-in-one platform if you like to diversify or test new markets.

## Is Model Lonox Hex a Scam?

Here’s the deal: No, Model Lonox Hex **does not appear to be a scam**.

I’ve tested it, read user reviews, and compared it with platforms like **Bitcoin Era**. The trading bot actually functions, withdrawals are processed in a reasonable timeframe, and customer support responds (which is more than I can say for some other platforms).

That said, always proceed with caution. Crypto trading is inherently risky, and no platform can guarantee profits. Use the demo account first, and **never invest money you can’t afford to lose**.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Model Lonox Hex?

The minimum deposit to start trading is **$250**. This is pretty standard for trading bots and automated platforms.

The good news is that this isn’t a fee—it’s your actual trading capital. You can use it to execute trades right away, or test strategies with the demo account first.

### Model Lonox Hex Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tested them twice—once at 2 AM just to see if they’d respond, and yep, I got a reply in under 5 minutes.

They’re helpful but not overly technical, so you won’t get lost in jargon. It’s more like talking to a personal assistant than a tech support robot.

## How do you start trading on Model Lonox Hex?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head to the official Model Lonox Hex website and fill in your name, email, and phone number. They’ll send a verification link—click it, and you’re in.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You’ll need to verify your identity (standard KYC stuff). Upload proof of ID and wait for approval—it usually takes less than 24 hours.

Once verified, deposit at least **$250** using credit/debit cards, bank transfer, or crypto.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can either activate the **automated trading bot** or use the manual mode if you prefer more control. I recommend starting with the demo mode to get a feel for how the system works.

## How to Delete a Model Lonox Hex Account?

If you decide Model Lonox Hex isn’t for you, you can request account deletion by contacting customer support. They'll walk you through the process, and it usually takes 2–3 business days to process the closure and return any remaining funds.

Make sure to withdraw all your funds before requesting deletion.

## The Verdict

Model Lonox Hex isn’t just another shiny trading bot—it actually works, and it’s especially useful for beginners who want a **low-barrier entry into crypto trading**. The AI features, real-time analysis, and multi-asset support are legit strengths.

Yes, it has some downsides—like the lack of a mobile app and a somewhat vague origin story—but overall, it delivers on what it promises. If you’ve got $250 to test it out, I’d say it’s worth a shot.

## Key Features Analysis

The best cast iron sinks offer a combination of robust construction, attractive design, and practical features. Consider these key aspects when evaluating different models.

**Material and Construction:**

The Core of any cast iron sink is, predictably, cast iron. This material is known for its extreme durability and ability to withstand high temperatures. high-quality sinks feature a thick, even layer of cast iron, ensuring long-lasting performance. The cast iron base is then coated with a thick enamel layer, which provides a smooth, non-porous surface that is resistant to scratches, stains, and chips. The quality of both the cast iron and the enamel coating is critical to the sink's overall lifespan and appearance.

**Enamel Finish and Color Options:**

the Enamel Finish is extremely important, and is the top layer of the sink, and directly interacts with dishes and water. The enamel finish is not purely aesthetic and functional, as it provides a protective layer against stains, scratches, and chemicals. Look for sinks with a high-gloss enamel finish that is easy to clean and maintain. Color options are also a crucial consideration,and cast iron sinks are available in a wide range of colors to match any kitchen décor. Popular choices include white, black, biscuit, and various shades of gray.

**Size and Configuration:**

the Size and configuration have to be suitable for the kitchen. Cast iron sinks come in various sizes and configurations, including single-bowl, double-bowl, and farmhouse styles. Consider the size of yoru kitchen and your typical usage patterns when selecting the right size and bowl configuration. Larger sinks with double bowls are ideal for busy kitchens where multiple tasks are performed concurrently, while smaller single-bowl sinks are better suited for compact spaces.

Cast Iron is prone to making a racket when pots and pans get thrown around in it, and sound dampening technology can help reduce this. Sound dampening pads or spray coatings applied to the underside of the sink help to minimize noise from running water and clanging dishes. This feature is especially beneficial for open-concept kitchens where noise can easily travel to other living areas. Sinks with effective sound dampening provide a quieter and more pleasant kitchen surroundings.

**Installation Style:**

Undermount, drop-in, and apron-front installation styles dictate the look and complexity of the installation of a new sink. Undermount sinks are installed beneath the countertop, creating a seamless and modern look. Drop-in sinks, also known as top-mount sinks, are installed from above and rest on the countertop. Apron-front sinks, also known as farmhouse sinks, feature an exposed front that adds a rustic touch to the kitchen. Each style has its advantages and disadvantages, and the best choice depends on your personal preferences and kitchen design.

The specific pattern and color variations within the stone are what make each slab unique, ensuring your countertop is truly one-of-a-kind. These variations can significantly impact the overall look, from subtle and uniform to bold and dynamic. The color palette also lends itself well to various kitchen styles, working well in both modern and conventional settings.

**Durability and Heat Resistance:**

Granite, by its very nature, is an incredibly durable material. Cream granite countertops are highly resistant to scratches, stains, and heat. This extraordinary resistance makes them ideal for busy kitchens where hot pots and pans are frequently used, and spills are common. While it's always recommended to use trivets for extremely hot items, cream granite can withstand normal cooking temperatures without being damaged. Its resistance to scratching also means it can withstand the cutting and chopping that are central to food readiness.

**Maintenance and Sealing:**

While granite is durable, it is a porous material and requires regular sealing to prevent stains from penetrating its surface. Most cream granite countertops are sealed with a protective coating that helps to repel liquids and prevent staining. The frequency of resealing will depend on the type of sealer used and the level of use, but generally, it's recommended to reseal once or twice a year. Day-to-day cleaning is simple, requiring only warm water and a mild soap. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the sealant and the stone itself.**Slab Size and Thickness:**

Cream granite is typically available in slab form, with standard thicknesses ranging from 2cm (3/4 inch) to 3cm (1 1/4 inch). The thicker slabs offer greater durability and are often preferred for larger countertops or islands. The size of the slab will determine the number of seams required for your countertop. Larger slabs are generally more expensive but can minimize the number of seams,resulting in a cleaner,more seamless look. It's important to consider the slab size when designing your kitchen to optimize material usage and minimize waste.

## Core Benefits

Cream granite countertops offer a multitude of benefits for homeowners, blending functionality with aesthetic appeal. Their durability, ease of maintenance, and unique style make them a worthwhile investment for any kitchen.

But what I experienced at Poothali Homestay in North Kerala was far from that. It wasn’t just a ritual; it was a soul-stirring moment—raw, powerful, and deeply human. In the quiet of a rural night, I sat just feet away from a tradition that’s been breathing for centuries, yet so few truly experience.

# Arriving at Poothali: Where Culture Breathes Naturally

https://preview.redd.it/3iipfx5p0zef1.jpg?width=630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf0dadb08eb2188afda6b34b44bf43d9d14d9100

Poothali is not your usual homestay. Nestled in a small village in Kasaragod, it doesn’t try to impress with luxury or modern gimmicks. Instead, it quietly offers you something deeper—a slow-paced life rooted in community, nature, and authenticity. The moment I entered the space, with its laterite stone walls and clay-tiled roofs, I could sense I was about to step into a different world.

What I didn’t expect was that my visit would align with a local Theyyam performance happening in the nearby village temple. When the host mentioned it casually over dinner—banana-leaf served rice and curry, eaten with my fingers—I was intrigued but unprepared for what was to come.

# What is Theyyam, Really?

https://preview.redd.it/mrp1sltw0zef1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f5a0d76dbdc1f41fd22a6524ea9a13f85f1cc5c

For those unfamiliar, Theyyam is not a “performance” in the entertainment sense. It is a ritual art form practiced in North Kerala, especially in Kasaragod and Kannur, where the performer becomes the deity they represent. Through dance, music, and possession-like states, Theyyam invokes ancestral spirits and divine energies believed to protect the community.

There are no big stages or scripted dialogues. Instead, it unfolds in temple courtyards, sacred groves, and village grounds—often in the dead of night or early morning. It's loud, intense, colorful, and at times chaotic—but above all, it's real. You’re not watching a show; you’re witnessing faith in motion.

# The Walk to the Temple: Anticipation in the Air

Around 2 a.m., we began our walk to the temple, guided only by starlight and the occasional torch. The village was silent except for the distant sound of chenda drums, gradually growing louder. There was a sense of collective anticipation. Locals were gathering, not for entertainment, but for reverence. I could feel I was entering something sacred.

There were no fences or VIP zones. I simply stood among villagers, barefoot in the red earth, as an old man near me whispered, “It’s Kuttichathan Theyyam tonight.” He explained how this particular form is known to bless families and protect against misfortune. His eyes, like everyone else’s, were filled with respect.

# When the God Arrived

And then, the Theyyam appeared.

Flaming torches illuminated his entrance. His face was painted in intricate red and white, his headgear rose nearly five feet tall, and ankle bells jingled as he moved in swift, rhythmic bursts. The chenda drums echoed in my chest. The performer’s eyes were fierce, his movements otherworldly.

In that moment, he wasn’t a man. He *was* the god.

He moved through the crowd—no barriers, no guards—blessing elders, touching children’s foreheads, accepting offerings of rice, coconut, and betel leaves. People weren’t clapping or taking selfies. They were praying. Some were even weeping. A young woman next to me held her baby tight and whispered a chant I couldn’t understand—but I understood her emotion perfectly.

# A Moment of Eye Contact

At one point, the Theyyam stopped directly in front of me. Our eyes met for a brief second, and I swear time slowed down. There was no way he knew me, yet I felt seen—as if the deity he embodied could read through me. I wasn’t a tourist anymore. I was just another soul in that crowd, caught in the gravity of an ancient ritual that demanded no explanation, only presence.

# Stories and Silence After the Ritual

When the performance ended, the performer was gently led away to change and rest. Villagers began dispersing slowly, still carrying the weight of the ritual on their faces. Back at the homestay, we didn’t talk much. There was a natural silence, the kind that follows a profound experience. Over black coffee at sunrise, our host told me how Theyyam is not just about religion but about community memory—how it carries forgotten legends, caste struggles, and nature worship within its flames.

He also said something that stayed with me:

>

# Why Poothali Felt Different

What makes Poothali so special is that it doesn’t try to “package” culture for outsiders. You’re not an audience member watching from the sidelines. You’re gently invited in, allowed to be part of something real—if you’re willing to respect it.

There are no rehearsed welcome dances, no forced photo ops. Instead, you might end up helping grind spices in the kitchen one day and end up at a village ritual the next. It’s unpredictable, yet deeply rooted in something steady and eternal.

# Final Thoughts: From Curiosity to Connection

https://preview.redd.it/f373hz391zef1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d29957d36a439863323e5fa10eea063f8b6cc260

When I came to Poothali, I was just curious. I had read about Theyyam in magazines and blogs, seen photos of men in elaborate costumes leaping through fire, and I wanted to *see* it.

But what I got was something I hadn’t expected: a genuine connection. Not just to an art form or a village, but to a deeper rhythm of life that most of us in cities have forgotten. It wasn’t about the visuals. It was about the vibration, the breath, the belief.

As I left Poothali a few days later, I realized something strange—I didn’t take a single photo during the Theyyam. Not because I forgot, but because it didn’t feel right. Some things are better felt than documented.

So if you ever find yourself in North Kerala, and if you get the rare chance to witness Theyyam in a place like Poothali—don’t go expecting a show. Go prepared to listen, to stand quietly, to feel your heartbeat sync with the drums, and to be changed in ways you won’t fully understand.",1,1753427864.0,u_Fluid_Ad5714,0,1.0,False

But over time, one by one, they all decided to move back.

Now it’s just me here, and honestly, it’s been pretty tough. I never thought I’d feel this isolated. I work and keep busy, but not having close friends around anymore really hits hard, especially on weekends or during quiet moments. I miss having someone to grab a coffee with, chat about random stuff, or just hang out.

Not sure what I’m hoping to get from this post, maybe just wanted to put it out there.

1m8snjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/blockheads/comments/1m8snjh/2nd_blockhead_item_types_explained/,2nd Blockhead Item Types Explained,"**\[NOTE: The google spreadsheet is under construction.\]**

When you create the world, warp a blockhead, click the portal, and then click the blockheads, to warp a second blockhead, you need 50 time crystals + 5 food items (or 50 time crystals + 10 sapphires + 5 food items in expert mode). However, the food items do not appear the same as you generate different worlds with a given size and whether or not you enabled custom rules.

https://preview.redd.it/kygxmeudxyef1.png?width=1702&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9f07ad23c90eaf82182ab0165233969c93e0694

[This 1x, expert, vanilla world identifies 5 tomatoes](https://preview.redd.it/q84lchudxyef1.png?width=1702&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cc886fb4c7c651901fb0d8e2568ebfdd669cb37)

This gives me an interest of what food items that appear more often than the others. It happens when I stumbled getting a world that identifies 5 prickly pears, and I noticed that some food items are rarer than others.

I also noticed that enabling custom rules will give you advanced configurations, and some of them can greatly affect the food items that normally do not appear. For example, setting precipitation to ""very dry"" will see sand everywhere, and it requires mozzarella, which never occurs in normal food types (apples, cherries, oranges, tomatoes, coconuts, mangoes, carrots, corns, chillies, dodo eggs, prickly pears, and coffee cherries). You can also get cooked dodo meat for having ""no trees"" and ""no plants"" option. **There are rumors of having 5 rainbow cakes, but I had not fully tested that yet and then identifying what configurations will have 5 rainbow cakes.**

Because of this, I created a Google Spreadsheet to track down the food statistics. They are also color coded: green being \[20, 100\] probability, yellow being \[10, 20) probability, orange being \[1, 10) probability, red being (0, 1) probability, and grey as 0 probability (I am using the math set notation as the inequality). 

**How this is done:**

This is done in mac computer, being automated with Python programming to do the automatic work: starting in the world creation, generating the world with specific configurations, warping a first blockhead, gather statistics in the 2nd blockhead's food items, exit, delete the world, and head back to the world creation. In Mac, there is a segmentation fault bug that happens when you attempt to create/join the 6th world, which sometimes crashes. So in each loop, the program generates/deletes 5 worlds at a time, close the window, and then reopen the window. 

While generating 1/16x size world in expert difficulty with vanilla rules, I noticed that there were already blue and white teleportation particles before warping a first blockhead. I inferred that there were fewer world samples with this given configuration, compared with other world samples with same configurations but in larger sizes. However, this small observation can affect the statistics, resulting to not being 100% accurate. As such, I still have doubts of redoing the data gathering because I generated the world too fast. Nevertheless, this provides a perspective of whether you wanted to have a specific food type or quickly get an easier world generation in expert mode. 

**SPREADSHEET:** [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zv59w0nMiyVjTaMiY-3upF\_Wjt5QqZtkYAe1Rf6zxEM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zv59w0nMiyVjTaMiY-3upF_Wjt5QqZtkYAe1Rf6zxEM/edit?usp=sharing)

**ADDITIONAL NOTES:**

* **Normal food items:** apples, cherries, oranges, tomatoes, coconuts, mangoes, carrots, corns, chillies, dodo eggs, prickly pears, and coffee cherries.
* **\[NOT FULLY TESTED\]:** given that you have the same seed and same world size, whether or not you are in normal or expert mode does not affect the type of food items. For example, given a 1x world with seed of 14, regardless of what mode you are in (normal or expert), it will always require 5 cherries as food items.
* It is easy to identify which biome you are currently at or you can easily move to by looking at the food items. For example, if it identifies 5 prickly pears, then a desert biome is nearby. If it identifies 5 mangoes, then an equatorial biome is nearby. If it identifies 5 oranges, then either you are in the temperate biome with cherry trees or apple trees nearby, or you are in the equatorial biome with mango and sometimes coffee trees nearby. **This is not necessarily the case if you are using the custom worlds.**
* Since you have 5 options of world sizes (1/16x, 1/4x, 1x, 4x, 16x), whether you want to be in normal or expert mode, here are the calculations:
   * This means you have 10 ways to have configurations of any size, any mode, and using normal rules. 
   * In a custom rules option, assuming that the seed option has ""random"" and ""custom"" and not going ""custom"" in detail (since it would be too large to go each by each), there are 199,065,600 configurations. Accounting for world sizes and modes, you have 1,990,656,000 ways to have configurations of any size, any mode, and using custom rules.
   * In total, there are 1,990,656,010 configurations. **This can be really large to track down each, so for the sake of interest, only customized worlds with selected configurations whose food types do not appear in normal ones are considered.**

**MISSING:**

* Food statistics in customized worlds, worlds in 16x size, and worlds in normal mode are not fully gathered. **\[AS OF 25 JULY 2025\]**

ChatGPT Feels Like the Creative Superpower We’ve All Been Waiting For! 🚀,"Is anyone else INSANELY excited about how ChatGPT keeps evolving? Seriously, sometimes I have to take a step back and remind myself that, yes, this is real life and not a sci-fi movie. I mean, we’re living in an era where you can bounce wild ideas off an AI, brainstorm for hours, code, write stories, LEARN new things—all while sipping your coffee in your pajamas!

Here’s why I’m enthusiastic about ChatGPT right now:

- It feels like a never-tiring idea buddy. Want to build an app? Ask ChatGPT. Stuck on a tricky bug? Ask ChatGPT. Need to write a sonnet about microwave pizza at 2 a.m.? You guessed it—ChatGPT to the rescue.
- It adapts! The level of personalization blows my mind. I’ve watched it pivot from corporate emails to dad jokes to roleplaying as a historical figure, seamlessly.

Can we talk about ACCESSIBILITY for a second?

- AI used to feel like a “walled garden” for techies, researchers, or those with mountains of resources. Now anyone with internet can join in.
- I've watched friends and family—who always said ""I'm not good with tech""—become *curious* and *creative* through just chatting with an AI.

Creativity feels supercharged these days.

- “Prompt engineering” sounds fancy but it’s honestly just a fun way to experiment. First attempt: weird poem. Second attempt: better poem. Fifth attempt: you’ve created the next viral meme.
- It’s like panning for gold, but every handful of “sand” could spark a whole new hobby, side-project, or even startup.

Let’s not forget the community magic here.

- Genuinely, scrolling through what the community shares is my favorite part of the day. From wild comic book ideas to full-blown GPT-based applications, it’s heartwarming to see what people CREATE.
- The energy is contagious! Every breakthrough or funny exchange reminds me how CLOSE we are to a world where AI is more than just a tool—it’s a real collaborator.

I know—there are kinks to work out, concerns to address, and important lines to draw (AI is still learning, just like us). But right now, seeing so many people inspired—across backgrounds, ages, and fields—is just... the coolest thing ever.

So here’s my challenge to you:

- What’s the most unexpected or joyous ChatGPT moment you’ve had recently? What are you building, creating, or exploring?
- Have you introduced someone IRL to ChatGPT and watched their faces light up? (Bonus points for stories with parents, grandparents, or pets—all are welcome!)

Let’s celebrate: We’re probably the luckiest generation ever to have this much creative power at our fingertips. 🚀

At this point I honestly don't know how I'm still alive, I'm consuming enough sugar to kill an elephant at this point. I no longer have power over anything I do anymore and it's scary. At this point I want someone to put a straight jacket on me and put me away into a room. 

When I reach out to doctors, they are dismissive or refer me to whoever their eating disorder therapist is. Half the time I can't get an appointment or I get a doctor that doesn't take me seriously. The last time I saw an ED therapist she actually said to me, ""I don't think I can help you."" and emailed me blog articles about doing more yoga. 

I want to drive my car off a fucking cliff. ",7,1753427341.0,sugarfree,6,1.0,False

1m8scyb,https://i.redd.it/8b8algarvyef1.png,Leaving You Bereft - Six years of love and four years of marriage. It was over.,"After four years of marriage, before the seven-year itch could even kick in, Julian Ziegler already had a mistress.

At the gate of an upscale villa in Brindlewood, Willow Harper sat quietly in the backseat of an expensive car, watching her husband sneak around with another woman.

The woman was young. Dressed in a white dress, she looked innocent and enchanting.

They held hands like lovers, and Julian wore a tenderness Willow had never seen.

The woman tilted her head up and playfully pouted at Julian. ""My feet hurt. Carry me, Julian!""

Willow thought Julian would refuse. After all, he was known for being a cold, unapproachable man with a short temper. No matter how much he indulged his lover, he'd never tolerate that kind of fuss.

But the next moment, Willow was slapped in the face.

Julian gently rubbed the woman's delicate nose, looking both aloof and tender. Then, he picked her up effortlessly, cradling her in his arms as though she were the rarest of treasures.

The woman's soft hands instinctively slid around the back of his neck. Her fingers lightly traced his hair.

There was a cherry angioma on Julian's neck, which looked seductive and felt sensitive to the touch.

Willow had once accidentally brushed against it in bed, and Julian had turned wild. He pinned her arms down and thrust into her, hard.

Sure enough, Julian couldn't control himself. He pushed the woman against a pillar in the gazebo with an intense gaze.

Willow shut her eyes, unwilling to watch any longer.

She had never seen Julian like this—so wild with passion.

So, what did that make her?

Before they married, Julian had actively pursued her, saying, ""Willow, you're the perfect partner for me in this world of power and prestige.""

That one sentence made Willow abandon her love for art. She threw herself into marrying Julian and plunged headfirst into the world of business, like a moth to the flame, consumed by passionate love.

In four years, Julian had seized control of the Ziegler family.

Since then, Willow had become a dispensable pawn. He found her too proper and lacking in femininity, so he kept a mistress on the side.

Willow blamed herself for being so naive. She was such a joke.

…

When she opened her eyes again, she felt nothing but indifference.

Love was gone, so now it was about the money.

The villa where Julian met his lover was their joint marital property.

Willow didn't want to let this shameless couple have it. She quietly asked her secretary, Annie Hudson, in the front seat, ""Has Julian been with her for the past three months?""

Annie answered immediately, ""The woman's name is Catherine Burke. She's Mr. Ziegler's childhood sweetheart, though not very bright. Three months ago, Mr. Ziegler pushed through objections and arranged for her to join his company, keeping her well protected.""

She handed a stack of documents to Willow.

Willow skimmed through them. She felt like she could make way for Catherine.

As long as Julian was willing to split the joint property, she'd take her share and leave, with no second thoughts.

Outside, the autumn leaves were golden. The setting sun cast a golden glow. It looked dazzling and bright.

Willow steadied her emotions and dialed Julian's number. He was probably still having fun with Catherine, as the phone rang several times before he picked up.

His tone was cold and aloof when he answered. ""What is it?""

Willow lowered her eyes. ""It's my birthday today. Are you coming home for dinner?""

There was a long silence on the other end.

Julian didn't want to come home. Of course, he could make up any excuse to avoid it—another engagement he couldn't miss.

But Willow could clearly hear Catherine's voice on the other end. She was calling him, ""Are you done yet, Julian? Don't talk to her.""

Julian hesitated. After a moment, he awkwardly replied, ""If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up now.""

The sound of the phone disconnecting followed.

This was typical Julian—always decisive and never dragging things out.

Annie shouted angrily, ""Mr. Ziegler's too much! He actually forgot!""

But Willow didn't mind.

Oh, it really was a shame that Julian's sweet time with Catherine was interrupted by her! But what could they do about it, anyway? Willow was the legal wife, after all. If she was upset, then she'd make sure to rain on Julian and Catherine's parade as well.

Willow smiled faintly. ""He hasn't forgotten. He just doesn't care. Annie, call and have the electricity, water, and gas shut off at that villa. He'll come home then.""

Annie couldn't help but say, ""You're really smart, Ms. Harper.""

Willow didn't respond. She turned her face toward the window and stared at the outside world.

The setting sun painted the sky in gold, and the evening clouds gathered in a tranquil embrace.

She clearly remembered that on an evening just like this, with the sky painted in crimson, she had asked Julian if their marriage contract was for life and if they would never betray each other.

Julian had said yes, that Willow was the most important person to him.

But now, he made her feel like money was all that mattered.

A single tear slipped down Willow's cheek…

…

Willow returned to Grandview Manor.

Half an hour later, Annie brought in the divorce papers. Willow was asking for half of the joint assets.

After a bath, she was already dressed, but something made her turn back to the mirror. She slipped off her bathrobe and examined her figure under the bright crystal lights.

Her body, worn from years of hard work, was naturally not plump. Thankfully, her smooth skin made her give off an air of cool elegance.

But it was clear that she wasn't alluring enough for Julian. Otherwise, why would he be looking elsewhere?

Suddenly, Willow thought of Catherine and even imagined Julian in bed with her. How intense it must have been. It must be far more passionate than when he was with her.

She frowned slightly, feeling embarrassed by her comparison.

Just then, the closet door creaked open.

Julian was back.

He stood at the door of the closet.

His tall, lean figure was wrapped in a luxury black shirt and pants. His chiseled features glowed under the bright lights, exuding the charm of a mature man.

Willow couldn't help but think that even without his vast fortune, his looks alone would make countless women eager to have a fling with him.

She had slept with him for four years. To some extent, her marriage wasn't that bad.

The couple exchanged a glance and said nothing.

Julian walked slowly into the closet and stooped behind Willow as they both looked at their reflections in the mirror. Willow had already gathered her clothes, and her hair was neatly tied up. Even her post-bath look radiated a strong, capable woman.

Julian clearly remembered that on their wedding night, Willow was still somewhat fragile. She trembled with fear at the sight of his body.

But that night, nothing had happened.

Two weeks later, after a business mishap, Willow had curled up in his arms, whispering his name. He had hugged her tightly. That night, they had truly become husband and wife.

Their bed life had been sparse.

At home, Willow was the dignified Mrs. Ziegler; at Nebula Group, she was a powerful executive. She always wore an unapproachable mask, cold as ice.

Even in bed, Julian would say Willow had never truly let go and enjoyed it.

After some time, he found it boring.

Julian leaned in and teased, ""You had the electricity and water shut off at the villa, didn't you? You're upset because I'm taking care of a respected elder's daughter?""

Willow stared at him in the mirror.

Julian knew it was her ovulation period.

He gently caressed her earlobe, his voice low as he murmured, ""Was it for your birthday or your physiological needs? Mrs. Ziegler, you're just 26 and already so demanding, huh?""

His words were crude, but Willow knew what he was after.

He wanted a child.

Julian's grandfather, Dominic Ziegler, still held 10% of Nebula Group's shares. Julian needed an heir to gain more leverage.

But what Julian didn't know was that having a child would be difficult.

During that accident, when Willow had pushed Julian away, she'd been violently kicked in the abdomen. This reduced her chances of having a baby.

Willow gently closed her eyes to hide the pain.

But Julian seemed unusually eager.

He easily picked her up, carried her to the large, soft bed in the master bedroom, and quickly pinned her down.

But Willow wasn't willing.

She pressed her hand against his chest, her hair partially undone and spilling across the white pillow. Her bathrobe was slightly loosened. ""Julian!""

Julian, however, couldn't take his eyes off her face. His gaze was feverish as he leaned down to kiss her. His body was already poised and ready.

Chapter 2

Willow clenched the bedsheet. Her fingertips left behind a mess of wrinkles.

Even at a time like this, she found herself wondering if Catherine didn't satisfy Julian. Otherwise, why would he bother wasting time kissing her tonight instead of going straight to the point?

Willow felt nothing other than disgust.

So, she simply lay there like a plank, letting him do whatever he wanted. No matter how hard he tried, he wasn't getting a child out of her anyway.

At first, Julian was aroused by the seductive Willow in her loosened bathrobe. But now, she just lay there like a lifeless plank on the sheets.

Even the most eager man would find it uninspiring.

What a mood killer.

Sweat clung to the tips of Julian's hair. With a flushed face, he asked in a husky voice, ""What's wrong? Not in the mood anymore?""

They didn't sleep together often, but it still happened a few times a month. Those were his attempts to plant an heir in her body.

Willow lay on the white pillow, staring up at the man she had been with for four long years.

She was exhausted. For once, she wanted to live for herself.

But Julian didn't know that. He kept questioning why she refused to be intimate with him and why she wouldn't cooperate in giving him a legitimate heir to help him secure more power.

Willow reached out, gently tracing her fingers along his face. In a soft voice, she said, ""Julian, let's get a divorce.""

His expression darkened, but he forced himself to stay calm. ""Is this because of Catherine? I've already told you. She's just a respected elder's daughter. You don't want her staying there, so I've already arranged for her to move elsewhere.""

Willow let out a sneer.

A respected elder's daughter who needed to be kept in a private villa? Who had to be held so intimately when they walked together?

Willow didn't even bother arguing. It was beneath her.

Instead, she pulled open the nightstand drawer and took out a divorce agreement. Shoving it into his hands, she said in a light tone, ""I want half of Nebula Group's shares in addition to the bank savings and real estate.""

Julian frowned. ""Half of Nebula Group's shares? That's a bit greedy, don't you think, Mrs. Ziegler?""

There was sarcasm in his voice, the same sharpness he used in business negotiations.

Willow's heart turned to ice.

Julian would never know that by taking that hit for him, she had lost her chance to ever become a mother. But she wasn't about to mention it. It would only sound pathetic.

She had never regretted loving or hating him. She had given everything freely, and now she was ready to walk away just as easily.

Willow leaned against the headboard. Her fair face looked gentle.

She considered things from Julian's perspective. ""If we get divorced, you can finally give your beloved a legitimate title. And I will take my shares and leave. That's a happy ending for everyone.""

She looked completely serious.

That was when Julian finally realized that this wasn't just a spur-of-the-moment tantrum. She had planned this.

As he looked at her, his dark eyes deepened, as if he could devour her whole.

For a long time, he said nothing. Then his voice dropped to an icy edge. ""Forget it, Willow. That's never happening. We're business partners. You know that as well as I do.""

Oh, she knew.

But now? She didn't want to play along anymore.

When she didn't respond, Julian grew irritated. He got up, threw on a robe, and headed for the guest room.

He felt that Willow just needed time to cool down. By morning, she would likely find herself enjoying the feeling of being Mrs. Ziegler again, along with the thrill of being second in command at Nebula Group.

Julian sneered inwardly. Willow had always been like that.

Behind him, Willow's voice came softly, almost a whisper. It sounded almost like the timid Willow from four years ago. ""Let's part on good terms, Julian. I really don't want to be with you anymore.""

Julian's body stiffened.

After a long pause, he walked back to the bed and spoke softly, ""You knew, from the moment you married me, that there is no love in the Ziegler family. I won't love you. And you'd better not expect it either. It won't make your life any easier.""

With a flick of his wrist, the divorce papers scattered to the floor like falling snow.

…

At 8:00 am, Julian walked down the stairs, dressed in a perfectly tailored black-and-white suit. Every inch of fabric hugged his lean, powerful frame. He exuded effortless elegance.

His mood had been fine. That was, until he walked into the empty dining room.

Lifting his coffee cup, he asked the maid casually, ""Where's Willow?""

They had argued loudly last night, the noise echoing through the house. Even the maids knew about it. The maid replied cautiously, ""Mrs. Ziegler left for work early this morning.""

Julian slammed his coffee cup down with a heavy thud.

He suddenly lost his appetite.

30 minutes later, he arrived at Nebula Group in his car. His secretary, Esther Barker, was already waiting at the parking lot.

The black car came to a stop. Esther opened the car door and immediately briefed Julian on the day's meetings. As Julian walked, he buttoned up his suit jacket. His every move exuded masculine charm, causing several female employees to sneak glances.

The two of them stepped into the private elevator.

Esther paused, then lowered her voice. ""Ms. Harper has suddenly placed her people in Project Aurelia.""

Julian glanced at the glowing red numbers on the panel.

After a while, he chuckled. ""Looks like she's growing bolder.""

…

During the meeting, Julian and Willow clashed in a heated debate.

They were married, and Willow's business tactics were ones Julian had personally taught her. Watching them clash now was truly something to behold. The executives at Nebula Group were getting their money's worth in entertainment.

By the time the meeting ended, the sun was already setting.

Back in her office, Willow collapsed onto the leather couch, rubbing her temples.

A dull headache throbbed at her skull, making her feel drained. She let down her long hair, letting it fall in loose waves.

Annie set a glass of water on the table and whispered, ""Mr. Ziegler's personal attorney called. He'd like to meet you downstairs in the café. Do you want to go?""

Willow raised an eyebrow. ""Jeffrey Gibson?""

Jeffrey Gibson was one of the top lawyers in the country. His firm, Gibson Legal Group, was an industry leader.

More importantly, he was Julian's hidden hand. If Julian had something inconvenient to handle, Jeffrey handled it for him.

They were more than business associates. Their interests were deeply intertwined.

Julian could divorce Willow, but he would never burn bridges with Jeffrey.

Sending him meant one thing—Julian didn't want the divorce to become public knowledge.

After a moment's thought, Willow agreed.

…

Ten minutes later, she took the private elevator down to the café on the first floor.

Jeffrey sat by the window, dressed in a tailored three-piece suit that highlighted his tall, broad frame. His features were sharp, with a habitual expression of sternness.

Upon hearing Willow's footsteps, he looked up at her.

In his typically unreadable eyes, a flicker of surprise showed.

This wasn't the Willow he remembered.

In Jeffrey's memory, she was always impeccably dressed in expensive suits, standing by Julian's side with flawless composure as they navigated the cutthroat business world. But everyone in their circle knew that Julian didn't love Willow. His heart belonged to someone else.

But Willow looked different today.

She had changed into a comfortable, lightweight knit sweater that clung just slightly to her frame. Her sleek hair, with a subtle curl, fell loosely over her shoulders, looking soft.

Just as Jeffrey was mesmerized by her beauty, she sat across from him and asked coldly, ""Julian sent you?""

Jeffrey regained his usual calm composure.

He took a document from his briefcase and gently pushed it toward Willow. ""Mrs. Ziegler, according to this prenup, if you insist on divorcing, you won't get much out of it.""

Willow flipped through the pages. When she flipped to the last page, she paused for a moment. A flicker of surprise crossed her face.

Four years ago, Julian had kept a trump card hidden.

Willow stared at the document for a long time before finally saying, ""Even if I get nothing, I still want a divorce. And Jeffrey, don't call me Mrs. Ziegler anymore. Just call me Willow.""

After dealing with so many celebrity divorce cases, Jeffrey had become completely detached.

He picked up his cup and took a sip of his coffee. ""Why now? I thought you loved Julian. Affairs happen all the time in our world.""

Willow turned away, laughing bitterly.

Everyone knew she loved Julian, but Julian himself. Or maybe he knew. He just didn't care.

At that moment, Willow exuded a fragile kind of beauty. One that, in Jeffrey's eyes, was more likely to make a man want to possess her than even Catherine.

As he was contemplating this, the café door swung open, and a tall figure walked toward them.

It was none other than Julian.

As soon as he entered, he saw Jeffrey staring intently at Willow like he was lost in thought.

Suddenly, Julian felt a discomfort rise in his chest.

Chapter 3

Julian gave Jeffrey a slight nod.

Jeffrey smiled faintly and left, giving the couple, who were on different wavelengths, some space.

After Jeffrey left, Julian glanced at Willow and frowned. ""Why are you dressed like that? Go change. We're having dinner at the Ziegler residence later.""

Willow understood perfectly. When Julian mentioned ""dinner"", it was code for showing off their fake affection for Dominic's stake in the company.

At times, Willow couldn't help but feel that Julian was a contradiction. He presented himself as polished and serene, but beneath the surface, he was more driven by ambition and wealth than anyone. He was perfectly suited for the world of power and status.

Willow was willing to go along with it. Before they separated their assets, she would prioritize their interests.

She returned to her office to change into a suit and met Julian in the private elevator.

The elevator was empty except for the two of them.

Julian glanced at his watch and said casually, ""I think you've probably dropped the idea of divorce after talking to Jeffrey. You’re still in your fertile window. Get ready when we get home. If you're not into it, I'll make it quick.""

Willow gave a self-deprecating smile. Julian was as indifferent as ever when it came to discussing having children. And she had endured such a marriage for four years.

She was even colder. ""Same as before. I'll take half the assets and let you go free.""

Julian didn't like that response. He was about to snap when the elevator suddenly stopped.

The doors slid open.

Standing outside was a young lady in a white dress. She looked pure and innocent.

It was Catherine.

She stepped into the elevator and looked at Willow with a cautious plea. ""The employee elevator's broken. Can I borrow this one, Ms. Harper?""

There were three people in the elevator, yet it felt crowded.

Willow held the open button, saying nothing, but her message was clear.

Catherine was mortified. Her beautiful face flushed red. Biting her lip, she looked at Julian, silently asking him to step in and support her.

Julian, however, spoke gently. ""Do as Ms. Harper says.""

Catherine reluctantly stepped out of the elevator.

The whole scene disgusted Willow.

She didn't say a word even until she got into the car in the parking lot. Julian, however, casually spoke as he fastened his seatbelt, ""There's nothing between us. Don't overthink it.""

Willow turned and quietly watched him. ""Feeling sorry for her? Julian, maybe you should go get checked at a hospital.""

Julian misunderstood. He thought she was talking about their fertility. He answered naturally, ""I can have children.""

Willow sneered. ""I meant… You should get checked for STDs.""

That set him off.

He unbuckled his seatbelt, yanked her over, and pulled her onto his lap. Luckily, the car's front seat was spacious enough for him to move freely.

Willow's body hit the steering wheel with a painful thud.

She pushed him away with all her strength. ""Are you out of your mind, Julian?""

Julian, who seemed so refined, now had his head buried between her legs, doing all sorts of unmentionable things. In her frustration, Willow grabbed his hair and yanked so hard she almost pulled it out.

Finally, Julian stopped. He looked up at her.

His face was bathed in the dim light of the underground parking lot. His long lashes cast shadows over his sharp features. At that moment, his expression was almost tender and filled with pity.

Willow was taken aback.

But before she could react, Julian grabbed the back of her neck and kissed her violently. He bit down hard on her tongue, drawing blood.

Her blood mixed with their saliva.

Willow froze, staring at him in disbelief. Her disdain in her eyes was so obvious. Julian, still holding her lips, whispered, ""Am I clean, Mrs. Ziegler?"" His voice sounded breathless, showing great restraint.

Willow shoved him away.

She sat back in the passenger seat, trembling as she straightened her suit. Yet her chest still heaved from Julian's intense passion. This unfamiliar surge of emotions scared her, but she tried to appear calm. ""Don't worry. I'll have Annie arrange a checkup.""

Julian was aroused, but his desire waned when he saw her indifferent expression.

He buckled his seatbelt and stepped on the gas.

During the drive, Julian's phone rang several times. Willow guessed it was Catherine calling, but she had already decided on the divorce and didn't bother asking.

Julian glanced at Willow, his gaze lingering for a moment.

# A/ The Top 8 Useful Things I Realised While Job Seeking

1. Losing your job takes you through a whole holiday of travel experiences:- one day you're flying, then the worst happens and you're treading water. You try desperately to stay afloat, but fear, lack of confidence and fiscal fear drags you under - which eventually migrates into drowning. No matter how strong you are, you’ll have days when you can’t see the surface, but you CAN swim back up there.

2. Time is your friend dressed up as your enemy. Waking up with that feeling of dread, watching your bank account tick backwards, spending hours scrolling jobs you would never have considered until your back was against the wall, tick tock, tick tock… Flip it on its head – when was the last time you actually had ‘time’? It’s a blessing – a majestic and precious resource, and it’s FREE! Use it productively, waste it, sleep through it, exercise with it – it’s yours, it’s wonderful and it won’t be here forever.

3. Don’t get annoyed with recruiters and talent teams – remember, if you think the market is treating you badly, it’s just as bad for them, if not worse. Dissing them will just get you on their Blacklists. So don’t fire off angry emails and posts when things don’t go your way or you get ghosted. Write them if it makes you feel better, sure – just don’t hit send as you’ll need those bridges one day. If nothing else in here is useful, you’ll thank me for this advice down the line.

4. Make a game of job seeking – one hour of job seeking, one networking meeting or one solid application is one point, good for a long walk to a waterside pub. A decent interview or positive feedback is three points, which equates to a steak dinner. Get to ten points? Well, that’s a night out, for sure. New job = holiday. It’s a miserable process and it can take a looong time (trust me) so why not own it and make it fun?

5. The job market is in flux, so why not pivot with it? The economy is in meltdown, AI is apparently the cause of - and the answer to - all of life’s problems (Chapeau, Simpsons). Ageism is rife, JD’s change, thousands of applicants auto apply to hundreds of soulless  ATS systems, professional courtesy is a long forgotten myth and everything sucks. Perhaps NOW is the time to step away from the career you never really enjoyed and do that thing you’re good at, you’re passionate about and you’d excel in? You know as well as I do that you’d be AMAZING doing that thing you love, so if not now, then when?

6. When you’re waiting to hear news, the silence is DEAFENING. And yes, you feel powerless half the time, but it’s like dating:- you need to create a desirable, confidentand differentiated public persona which looks attractive and reliable to businesses. In your head, pretend you already have a job offer in hand, grill the interviewers hard on the key elements of the role and business. Make them desire you so they want to chase you above the hundreds of other lookalike candidates. 

7. Nobody really cares – I mean, of course, *some* people care – they care how you are, but don’t imagine everyone is out there doing the work for you – that’s on you. Grit your teeth, swat away the inevitable disappointments and self-doubt, celebrate the wins no matter how trivial and embrace the fact that when you get to where you’re going, it’ll be down to YOU, because YOU refused to eat sh\*t lying down

8. Your self-confidence and self worth will both take a hit, no matter how bulletproof you think you are. Desperation, apathy and ghosting gets us all, eventually. You wonder what you need to do, what you’ve done wrong, why nothing is happening, whether you need to pivot into plumbing and more. It’s natural, it’s painful and it’s inevitable, so don’t think you’re special, weak or alone. You’re not. 

9. Compromise isn’t the same as failure. 

10. The world is moving fast, especially for us marketers, and upskilling is more essential than ever. With all this wonderful time (and a newly polished CV to fluff) find new things to become an expert in. I leant into AI, creating images, data analysis skills and had a go at building agents. I focused on improving my writing, both by reading and writing every day. Then I took up metal detecting – not marketing related, you might think, but optimising my own [**TikTok channel**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.aGdhMTamDu4Bal38TnCvm2XsBAFmphKh487eL3wDOqz279Ky7E__a0A3Mbc8QZwfpa9s0ttcT--hPe7up3ruTmafhfV8Cw2D3kwxZC13oWIRw34ALLhPuy-SVIJI6J4ZKLYAGOQ41Qsp1kaX_ythLRrQYZzJR7tDFjDzql07FdbjyxGK2YOOUs5IGR0CYEpgUDe93b3tpI2e2eAecTiZ5ivZT1ESD74Uo45CTLbTKXkLdU-qWG3hDaJv8sTCCYEA0e8G2B_sX2qvasTJGcw4uf3lkrhhy66MNmu7qHslX3BAdENhLsWjxgrZaRa_oQQ2i2VCJNJfr88SXFyLA7Ij6Q/4ih/OQb-_1WkRu2EPlWlz705Xw/h9/h001.HQWm6m3PM3imSX3cgOO4eUuk1LXcO7cHcSAusIRcWfU) certainly is. 

# B/ Look After Number 1

As the Snickers X Tinder partnership headline would say (if it existed):- ‘You’re not you when you’re desperate’

1. Exercise – nothing will pull you out of a funk better than serotonin with a shot of fresh air

2. Read – self-improvement and learning is one route, but use all this wonderful free time to read those books you’ve been too tired to get into

3. Enjoy Yourself – They say you can’t hurry love, and you can’t hurry a job search, either. So, while you wait for a you-shaped role to emerge in this calamitous market, catch up with the friends you’ve ghosted when your career was going terribly well rather than terribly badly

4. Sleep – it’s a wonder drug (one I’ve suffered cold turkey withdrawal from whilst job seeking), so get to bed early, wake fresh, keep the coffee intake reasonable and let your brain switch off properly

5. Book in a mental health MOT – therapy, rest, acceptance and self-realisation aren’t woolly buzz words – they can be solutions. Your mind is an engine – service it regularly 

# C/ Weaponise Your Job Search 

1. Tailor your CV and cover letter for every job you go for. In this horror show market, one perfect application has a better hit rate than 1,000 generic Hail Marys

2. Don’t burn time – you can search and apply for all relevant jobs in the first 1-2 hours of the day. There are no prizes for doing an 8 hour shift, so get the grunt work done then move onto more productive things (see section A)

3. Recruiters and Headhunters aren’t wizards – they can’t magic roles from thin air. Some are more communicative, others have higher EQ, many will ghost you for lack of anything worth discussing. Build relationships with them but only as one part of a wider strategy.

4. Focus on LinkedIn Jobs, recruiters and, crucially, your network. The non-advertised roles your professional contacts know about (and can vouch for you on) are the hidden gold. You can read a comprehensive guide to customising a more effective approach in this [**Marketing Unfiltered article**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.aGdhMTamDu4Bal38TnCvmzNt9IhsDU5Jtux0fr2odqHaxBknfJYHD48oUCGaDOhOCPDgsa8wyFhLrHwfjW_YkSNy-el7L2DD9fHpgEtkph7k4GRDQyShEQkYe2n_DCgOHaHVUFpwMa7DraJSv3a7hvz5xsc3Q0X_GA6lxL7A2ec0KP7SbuElyAO52yvszNj1zJ2bxc-aoCV9DM7XotjGlw2qUK6BcUA1hjJ25X0e_mLnU-M0s308DyILLwzG7ELbumHSkcXKVUtmDmoOTnxpZAqvSXuPwoKNUdP-hy8lDBPPeOY5gcGcHQQaHwNEDuFP6pNRZBXXQvsqstot9o045M0rF17M_3DQWtPrpWLYhjd5VIelYZzSNnrF7C2sdYcqyFuzid7Zf8UFEu-FH6zFQ2y_QU7d2TczUSr5p89oHYtljeKXSC_Zii4J7wVEXa9Mfs13EIqd0g4djUs-mEu8P4K2Q21-Seruy7INRpoqYrLsFAvK6bzYrOol8aaKG789cTMM9N6KQJSbPC2lhD14D1BvcEfFDdZjEzhw-MHarXhL1emAs8iC1e2WnJacqa6E6FGzDz6sbIXuxo8p251vWR3QtyETIMo3AmHy_Chs2IrCs5Ar3bVw8J6iLCeI8gTgol3d7QIQlZEM6hauSytsmGMWOdcxumPDqgu3yoHTuakVh6cJmc43OIlyH-h7UtTKJo0Ak9bYGB0eMNnsTKNkJQ2dBHLHMmtbrGU5IhJRKd2booNB0JX5MgOzilmE4KsYPqyMRLXAGOcsc_J_g9XojuxjBMjUPwzI1WSZQA4gzER78Zsp4SKtihMM5y2ZswejUsyvTxKT3h22yzbEOdNwW6ISRSSjbnOJKFvGs7o-T9PB9h1qUzX8p8hYWsaQ5-sJfuyZ7ohh-KHGQnCX0iryhUnt9MoAA-i6CWzk3VtkwTE/4ih/OQb-_1WkRu2EPlWlz705Xw/h10/h001.-StMS3ZEtazMZXeGa_rzekqnN9SqR8KVWhPi_rYWENQ))

5. You don’t get any presents by hosting a pity party – get over those nagging fears and ‘woe is me’ thoughts asafp – they’re valid, sure, but about as useful as pastry pants. 

# D/ Magnify Your Personal Brand

1. People can’t hire you if they don’t know about you. Amplify yourself.

2. This could be on LinkedIn - comment as much as you post if you want maximum reach and engagement. This [**MU article**](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.aGdhMTamDu4Bal38TnCvmzNt9IhsDU5Jtux0fr2odqEsccQDE-BcuOigbUsiEDS7NvWYkC6mePZbBIyuvPZ9GvATrPkHPXntVlh1Q-1YKKjEVfUWBUSMztFcCOVdSINKxJv6qQq8DcCA7NLghh2z1OZSi-XRHX84QS6m9U3Y8JVrF2Zwm9UcGjvh9skCCC2zusaeV7W-ztVub2GTdEiYei8e6605v93YUnmWbbFsIIW8szCni3a1Gnw0QhjYnUiEfKbo5NStHbZaLKUdW_wlE6S1C_ZjJ3lIylKWPHTfB07lTXdbiyegdILXTTj-LSB2QZnJuHQlAhKDRSYAashfxvRozd1UUsGPpIXB_xfpcG6Lophg4ALRS19Of9iTSm4y1qkmmh6v4Q8KR84NN2_Si_Ct86vcAyyvNicIELa0atNkvHcXzngh2UH2g-G9_ISUDxrqFxzVcKvQjIh9C7R_US-ZptpSJ9JMOPDfVY0vQNPpeu2OojgacIW82dWVHLcSsL5iRK_QIPo4a84S036XP85_MxXd3q0uUcKpZnd5rQWiMnOHddwX5cqfC9FraGIurAydltCn5nFKyh_bP2W0EpYFhv_PLp-ZADdSxfyg2w4yv8lGqAHt6xK9PjUjBCSKrigW0iNhjFuKPX-d_ATIiCyCi9sZjhGiF4oH3eB6qYyFcboe-Owticy_AXNQcugwGyi7tawamjVdObrkjaYKHBEFS4W46wsMvgqLJWjV0Mw3fL_AVU1f89i5-uKg18LzNoQulF77Ii87BseV_9AsSP6xzLhk-mriFGRy-gRKVSUFg39rP-7ZWHFPnBGlhgfIK5AlhgIAT_bWNDzOjiNEJG1lVKQUi00fjPVFE6gxWKs/4ih/OQb-_1WkRu2EPlWlz705Xw/h11/h001.Uty3q4597Lc8YMucdC0xqL67wE9Q0d9h_0cM7butGeI) summarised the findings of an experiment I ran about what tickles the LI algo off the back of a viral post

3. Write, speak, rinse, repeat – say yes to any and all PR opps whether they be Podcasts, article quotes, writing or conference speaking. Even if you find this stuff hard, it’s free and if nothing else is good fodder for your CV and profile

4. Get a new LI headshot – you don’t have to pay for it; just get the best high res photo you have and use AI to optimise it. Then redesign your LI header image to say exactly who you are and how amazing you are – it’s a massive billboard and it’s free – but I bet you’re not exploiting it

5. Keep in touch with recruiters so you’re top of mind. I send an email monthly which feels like the Goldilocks frequency, and I write personal updates for each recruiter with amusing stories about my job search, hobbies and PR wins just so my email is a tiny bit more memorable than the other hundred desperate generic candidate notes they’ll get that day 

# E/ Don’t Give Up, Give Back

1. The annoying truth is that the job market is crap, and it might take you a while to get employed again. Get over that fact now and do something positive instead

2. Rather than whipping yourself with metaphorical birch twigs, you could use your oodles of experience to mentor younger folks in your line of work

3. This isn’t an entirely selfless act – while they’ll benefit from your objective advice and knowledge, you’ll extend goodwill in new and hitherto unexplored directions

4. Chances are professional bodies in your industry have mechanisms for mentorship in place already

5. So, lean into self-improvement by helping others improve themselves

# F/ Money, Money, Money

1. We might say we love work, but none of us would show up if we weren’t paid to do so. If you’re not working, you can use all this wonderful free time to mitigate spending. You’ll not only extend your runway but also set yourself up to be more cash efficient when that lovely salary does start rolling in again.

2. Review your direct debits – cancelling a couple of TV channels and subscriptions can rapidly add up to Hundred $ in savings every month

3. Renegotiate standing orders – I bet you can get way better deals on your mobile and utility bills

4. Shop clever – I lean into LIDL, ALDI and TK Maxx anyway. If you like steak and wine, there are some corkers to be had in the value supermarket meat, veg and wine aisles, too. Are you a curry fan? Great! Now, finally, you have the time to master the Dishoom cookbook cover to cover

5. Gamify your frugality. Set yourself a challenge – see if you can find £500 in monthly savings in the next week and if you manage it, treat yourself to a date night. You’ll still be 400 quid in credit, and you’ll be happier, too

**It's not you, it's everything**

I genuinely believe that how you handle yourself when things are shit is the genuine reflection of how far you've come, and the person you really are. Being unemployed *can* make you feel like a failure, but it absolutely, unequivocally shouldn’t. 

In a modern marketing career, it’s as common as a typo in a CRM email or an ill-advised social post, so stop beating yourself up, recognise it’s simply a product of circumstance and soon enough you’ll be stuck in a meeting, dreaming of the days you spent your mornings sat in your PJs, crafting AI enhanced cover letters to appease thankless ATS Gods.

Then again, maybe not…

1m8s944,https://lifestylemedicine.org.au/content/the-plastic-brain-the-potential-neurotoxicity-of-microplastics/,The Plastic Brain: The potential neurotoxicity of micro-plastics,"

---

SS: A summary of many sources validating the current state of micro plastics and the brain. There has been talks about the effects these plastics have on other body systems and the human brain is no different.

Some takeaways from the article:

""An ordinary plastic takeaway coffee cup releases about 1.4 million plastic particles per ml.20 If you do the maths, this translates to 350 million particles per 250ml cup. Disposable paper cups seem to be even worse, with one study detecting 10.2 million microplastic particles per ml leachate after 15 min of soaking in 85-90 C hot water.21""

This helps demonstrate the scale on how much plastic particles we consume from even one cup of coffee. Just one cup not too mention the unmeasurable amount of things one person does a day.

""Plastic particles are also great at absorbing and concentrating pollutants from the environment. In fact, plastic is so great at this, that it is used in analytical chemistry in a process called solid phase extraction for this purpose.  The problem is, once contaminated plastic particles have made their way into the human body, the pollutants in these plastic particles can be released when in contact with bodily fluids. Not surprisingly, these pollutants can reach concentrations many orders of magnitude higher than those detected in the surrounding environment.8,30,31""

Meaning that wherever the plastic came from it can hold very toxic chemicals until it reaches a warm body in which starts to release them, remember that microplastics are everywhere and no matter what we do we consume them, so knowing that they are a sponge for pollutants is not good.

""So how do human brain cells react when they are exposed to nano-plastics in a petri dish? Cell cultures react to plastic with oxidative stress and inflammation, a reaction which has been linked to various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease. Furthermore, if the plastic is allowed to absorb toxins (as it would in real world conditions), the harmful effect on brain cells increases.41""

Even in a clean environment, just plastic particles alone caused inflammation and oxidative stress in a test with human brain cells, which is a clear indicator of the damage it is doing. Combine this with the dirty plastic of the outside world and you have an even worse situation. It is also possible since micro-plastics can pass through the blood brain barrier if they are small enough in size. Recent research done in March confirms that there is indeed micro-plastics in our blood and they can be small enough to pass the blood brain barrier.

A cross study was done to analyze the effects of metallic particles in the brain for living animals and people since there was so much more research on it

""In animals, exposure to such particles leads to damage of nerve cells due to oxidative stress, and activation of microglia (these are local immune cells of the brain).42 Moreover, human studies show that exposure to pollutants in nano-size can accumulate in the vagus nerve (that’s the information “highway” between the gut and the brain, the core of the gut-brain axis) and contribute to neurodegeneration: Children who were exposed to these particles showed early changes of Alzheimer’s disease in their brains.43,44""

The effects of metallic nanoparticles are well known so if you compare the two we are much more exposed to micro plastics every day (everything) and the quantity of them continues to rise exponentially with no end in sight.

This is Nootropics related because the microplastic phenomenon is recent in terms of history so we are treading into unknown territory in human health and therefore cognition while shoving as much of it in our brain as possible. It's in breast milk, semen, sweat and most certainly accumulating in our brains as well. These micro-plastics are also very hard to remove once the deposit inside your body so accumulation is happening all the time.

## What is Lunexora?

Lunexora is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users trade cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and commodities using AI-driven tools. Think of it like your own virtual trading assistant that scans the markets in real time and helps you make smart moves.

The platform focuses on **simplicity and automation**, making it ideal for people who want to get into trading but don’t want to stare at charts all day. It offers features such as customizable alerts, real-time market analysis, and support for multiple assets. Basically, it’s built for modern traders who want smarter tools without the complexity.

## Who Created Lunexora?

The team behind Lunexora isn't exactly front and center, which is pretty common with trading platforms like this. From what I could gather, it was developed by a group of experienced traders and software engineers who wanted to build a user-friendly platform that uses AI to simplify trading.

While we'd all love a full LinkedIn list of the devs, this level of anonymity isn’t unheard of. Platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge** have similar backstories. Still, it would be nice to have more transparency here.

That said, the platform seems well-constructed and professional, which suggests an experienced team is behind the scenes, even if they're choosing to keep things low-key.

You can let Lunexora trade for you, or you can manually approve trades—it’s flexible.

Here’s how the process generally works:

1m8rxdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1m8rxdf/can_cannabis_impact_aging_study_shows_marijuana/,Can cannabis impact aging? Study shows marijuana could alter 'genetic code',"Research suggests that using cannabis may alter a person's epigenetic code.

[The research suggested that marijuana use can impact the genetic code](https://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2023/07/18/marijuana-use-linked-to-epigenetic-changes/) responsible for activating and deactivating various genes.

The study highlighted the importance of understanding marijuana's effects on the body, as it remains one of the most widely used drugs globally. While some effects are well-known, the research indicated a broader impact than previously anticipated.

Most notably, one marker identified in the study is similar to those found in tobacco use, suggesting a closer link between the two substances than previously thought.

Police connect with community over coffee at local McDonald's

Researchers originally aimed to find out how cannabis use affects the epigenetic code, which in turn could reveal potential positive or negative health effects for humans who use the substance. They focused on genes related to aging, typically regulated by the body's epigenetic code. Understanding these changes could provide insights into aging processes and the body's ""epigenetic age.""

“In our study, we observed associations between cumulative marijuana use and multiple epigenetic markers across time,” said Lifang Hou, who was the senior author of the study. “Interestingly, we consistently identified one marker that has previously been associated with tobacco use, suggesting a potential shared epigenetic regulation between tobacco and marijuana use. The observed marijuana markers were also associated with cell proliferation, infection and psychiatric disorders, however, additional studies are needed to replicate and verify these findings.”

The study involved data from participants who reported their cannabis use over several years. Researchers analyzed blood samples taken five years apart, comparing them based on factors such as continuous and recent cannabis use. The findings revealed several markers associated with both types of use.

Despite these insights, researchers emphasized the need for further studies to fully comprehend the connections and their extent within the epigenetic code.

“This research has provided novel insights into the association between marijuana use and epigenetic factors,” Dr. Drew Nannini said. “Additional studies are needed to determine whether these associations are consistently observed in different populations. Moreover, studies examining the effect of marijuana on age-related health outcomes may provide further insight into the long-term effect of marijuana on health.”

Nonetheless, the research offers new perspectives on the relationship between marijuana use and epigenetic factors.

Could Something Be Overlooked in Your Case Too?,"For nearly a year, she dragged herself through the mornings—numb fingers, aching back, and a quiet fear that something was deeply wrong. Every scan came back normal. “It’s just posture,” one doctor said. “Muscle strain,” said another. But none of that explained why even lifting her laptop at her office in Pimpri-Chinchwad felt like lifting bricks.

The pain crept into her nights, her workouts, even her walks home from Bhosari. Friends started suggesting yoga, calcium, and meditation. She tried it all. Still, the weakness in her legs worsened. She began doubting herself—maybe this *was* just stress.

One evening, after yet another sleepless night, she searched for an **orthopedic doctor in Pimpri-Chinchwad**—not for a second opinion, but a final attempt.

That’s when she found **Dr. Nirmal Patil** **at**[ Chetna Hospital](https://g.co/kgs/N7KizL4).

He didn’t rush. He asked questions that no one else had. He didn’t just look at her MRI—he *read between the lines*. A missed diagnosis. A condition that required timely intervention. She hadn’t imagined the pain. It had a name—and finally, a way out.

Weeks later, she stood at her window in Kalewadi, pain-free, coffee in hand, smiling quietly. Not because everything was perfect—but because she finally felt like herself again.",1,1753425024.0,OrthopedicDoctorsPune,0,1.0,False
1m8rx4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wattpad/comments/1m8rx4i/help_me_find_this_wattpad_horror_story/,Help me find this Wattpad horror story,"Hey everyone, I’m trying to find this Wattpad story I read back in 2019 (maybe even 2018). I don’t remember the title, but I think it was originally called something like Mr. Something’s Funhouse or Mr. ___’s Funhouse — though I know it was changed at some point.

Here’s what I remember:
	•	It starts on Halloween. A girl goes to a party dressed like a porcelain doll.
	•	She leaves the party and ends up walking alone, somehow finding an abandoned house/funhouse.
	•	Inside, she meets a group of weird people/creatures led by a mysterious guy
	•	She ends up at a coffee shop the next day and notices a newspaper with certain letters bolded. She puts them together and realizes it’s a secret message calling her back.
	•	There’s a competition (kind of like a twisted Chuck E. Cheese maze/slide thing) and she has to go through it while being hunted and there are other people also trying to win.
	•	She wins the competition and her prize is that she becomes one of them — she literally gets turned into a doll, like the one she dressed as.
	•	There’s a scene where they all eat dinner together, and she’s freaked out.
	•	One of the other “creatures” gets mad at her for disrespecting the leader and tries to kill her with smoke or magic by lifting her to the ceiling.
	•	The leader ends up killing that person to save her.
	•	Later, the girl ends up eating two humans who sneak into the funhouse when it’s closed — and the leader is really angry.
	•	The place functions like a haunted attraction, but the people inside aren’t actors — they’re real supernatural beings.

It had dark, twisted romance + horror + fantasy vibes. Almost like Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children. I remember it had two different titles at some point, and it wasn’t a super short story either.

I’ve been thinking about this story for years. Please help if you remember it!

He said it was because I’m “ruining his life” and “giving him body image issues” (like that’s a bad thing) but I know deep down that it was actually because I’m just SOOO skinny and tiny that he can no longer visually perceive me which is understandable ☺️

ANYWAY….on to bigger (not literally 🤮) and better things am I right? I downloaded some of those dating apps and I was hoping they had one for skinny people only but sadly not 😔 

I’m actually bi but if I ever dated a woman she would HAVE to be skinner than me and in that case I would probably do a murder-suicide on us both because I could NOT handle that kind of jealously 🥰 so sticking to men for now even though they repulse me lol. 

I can’t believe how many matches I got! Well actually I can because I’m just soo skinny and petite. Hehe. I’ve been on 3 dates today: the first one was a coffee date. I didn’t order any coffee I just took a whiff of my date’s and that was MORE than enough for the month (probably too much if I’m being honest.)
We chatted for a while about calories and posting and every cat I’ve ever owned. He seemed really nice and only a little bit fat but then he texted me later asking me if I was “ok” like alright Dr Phill why don’t you mind your fucking business! Cringe. 

The next date was a gym date; I was already getting MAJOR green flags based on that alone. He was super sexy, he does eat f**d but he ONLY eats chicken breast boiled in a broth of preworkout and water and he was really lean and veiny and muscley so I could respect it I guess. We actually had a lot in common— we both hate our bodies so much that we torture ourselves ceaselessly in the pursuit of imminent, merciful death 🤩

But anyway we get to the gym and then I fainted on the treadmill, chipped my fucking tooth, and I guess SWALLOWED my tooth chip by mistake. This sent me into a tailspin because who KNOWS how many calories that was and I was really embarrassed so after he took me to the hospital I told him never to speak to me again and then I swung by the parking lot on my way out and let all the air out of his tires ❤️

I should’ve known better than to go on the third date since he asked me out to DINNER if you can believe it. I thought maybe it was a joke, but nope I showed up at the “restaurant” and we sat down and he LITERALLY ordered food! I told him I was going to the bathroom and then I just went home and took a shower to cleanse myself of his fatass aura. 

How do you sweaties navigate the dating world? I’m a Leo, but I do understand that I need to be skinny for myself and NOT for anyone else. But I also would really like a special someone in my life to to fat shame and torture psychologically :/

lately, ang dami ko nababasa about relationships na mas mababa yung sahod ng guy kesa sa girl and hindi na daw sila makikipag date sa mas mababang sahod kesa sa kanila. oks lang naman yun kasi syempre, may kani-kaniya tayong preference and goals sa life. gusto ko lang i-share tong nangyari sa akin nung bday ko.

  
nasa engineering field ako and significantly, mas malaki yung sahod ko sa bf ko. last tuesday was my birthday. inaya niya ako sa mall kasi bibilhan daw niya ako ng gift. hindi ako nag e-expect ng something bongga kasi nga sakto lang yung sahod niya. nagulat ako kasi binilhan niya ako ng converse na sapatos HUHUHU! nabanggit ko kasi sa kanya dati na fake na converse lang binibili ko during college huhu! nagulat ako kasi may gustong-gustong din siyang sapatos sa vans pero hindi niya tinutuloy kasi mag wait na lang daw kami ng voucher online para mas mura. HUHUHU GRABE! mas inuna pa akong ibili. huhuhu! at hindi lang yan, binilhan din niya ako ng coffee maker, nilibre ako sa rame nagi, cake at ang pinaka-windang ako is may isa pang sapatos na dumating. sobrang saya ng puso ko huhuhuhu!

  
hindi ako materialistic talaga. lalo na at ako ang panganay, lumaki ako na sobrang tipid at kuripot. palagi daw kasi ako yung nag s-spoil sa family ko. this time, ako naman daw. HUHUHUHU! kahit simpleng monthsary lang, lagi akong may bulaklak sa kanya. minsan, sunflower na paborito ko, minsan pinitas lang sa daan, pero kahit alin don, sobrang saya ko. HUHUHUHU!

  
na realize ko na wala pala talaga yan sa laki o liit ng kinikita. sa willingness talaga yan magkaka-alaman. huhuhuhu! hayyy, ang sarap mabuhay. ",23,1753424574.0,CasualPH,4,0.9,False

but then it kept happening. i went for a walk alone on base one afternoon, didn’t post about it or say anything, and the next day he casually asked “how was your walk?” i froze a bit. played dumb. he just smiled.

another time i went to target off base. totally random trip. he texted me while i was there and said “get me that snack i like.” when i asked how he knew, he said “i just guessed.”

i checked my phone, my apps, location sharing. nothing obvious. he’s not on my socials, and i barely use them anyway. i don’t have an iphone so no shared location.

the other night i found this little tag thing in my gym bag. had no idea what it was at first, but when i googled it, it looked like one of those tracking tags you can stick to keys or bags. i asked him about it jokingly and he acted confused.

i don’t know if i’m being paranoid. maybe it’s coincidence. maybe i’m overthinking because i’m so used to structure and surveillance from work that now i see it everywhere. or maybe i’m not crazy, and he actually is keeping tabs on me. either way, i feel like i’m constantly being watched. it’s exhausting.",81,1753424487.0,dating_advice,45,0.94,False

Every other picture even if I'm smiling I know what's going on behind the scenes. When we went to Tucson and had a super fancy steak dinner and went to see my favorite author and get my books signed - he was smoking fent... I remember his addict friend wouldn't stop calling him and he ""went to the bathroom"" like 5 different times and I smelled it on him after one of the bathroom trips. Don't get me wrong that was a fun trip and most of the time I really was having a good time but I know the bad stuff that was also going on. So even tho I'm smiling and good in the picture I know what's also going on that isn't so happy and good. 

Every other picture is like this. There's always something I know that the happy picture doesn't show. Drugs, abuse, whatever, it's happening in all the pictures you just can't see it. Even if that moment the picture is, is a happy one, it's not a happy time. 

Every single one except the second date. He was sober during the second date, we went to a coffee shop and then walked around and then went to a park and then his place. It was literally a great time. The coffee shop was really fun and judging coffee shops was ""our thing"" in the beginning. There wasn't a bad thing that had happened. There wasn't something that was emotionally destroying me right out of frame. It was genuinely a great day and a great time and I was genuinely happy. 

That's why that's the hardest picture for me to look at, makes me the saddest, and is just genuinely heart wrenching.... It's before everything..  it's me before... It's me happy... I didn't know what was coming I was just having a great time... When I say I want to warn myself its her, it's that girl in that specific picture, freshly moved to Arizona starting a new job with amazing coworkers and going on successful dates with this guy... It was right before everything hit me and almost killed me multiple times... She was happy with life, she had trauma and mental health issues but had no idea how bad it was going to be soon enough 

That girl in that photo isn't me and I wish I could save her. She makes me sad. That picture is the saddest picture in my life. ",2,1753424410.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

Hi !

I'm a 24F living near Cannes in the South of France. While I am definitely more on the introverted side, once we break the ice you'll discover I'm an attentive listener with a genuine love for laughter and good conversation (and gossips)

My days are always fueled with music on my ears and a lot of cups of coffee. When I am not exploring coffee shops, you could find me reading or playing The Sims (or Euro Truck Simulator, I am a girly with many passions). I'm also completely crazy with dogs, obsessed by daschunds, and I don’t have a dog yet but it is definitely on my dream list

I am looking to connect with other women in the South of France, make new friends and have fun together. If you're curious to know more, send me a message, I would love to get to know you !",1,1753424400.0,meetup,0,1.0,False

1m8rqh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1m8rqh0/tall_rant_in_a_venti_cup/,tall rant in a venti cup,"ok so i’m the newest partner at my store. i’m out of training and everything, but im definitely still a green bean compared to those who have been with our store since it opened. i’m a quick learner; i know the menu and drink builds well and i make customer connections. i write on cups, i keep my bar clean (most of the time). and yet i still worry for my job. 

here’s the problem. my schedule mainly allows for closing, so that’s what i work (except weekends). i can pretty much hold my own on bar during a mid or even on a weekend morning when we’re super busy. but i CANNOT for the life of me stay caught up when we’re super busy get these mini afternoon rushes. i don’t know if it’s because my store is near a beach, and people like to get their cold drink fix before/after spending some time there, or if it’s because my store is still relatively new (little over a year old) and in a busy town but we get the worst afternoon rushes. and we have to deal with those with 3 PEOPLE. and ofc the ssv has other tasks to complete. so my drive time gets bad bc im constantly soloing on drive and bar. 

and then ppl say “you should ask for support”. i do and maybe it’s just my ego but i feel incompetent when i have to ask. and im supposed to ask for help when the queue gets too long… first of all the ipads aren’t being left out all day/replaced when they need to be charged so i only have one DPM on drive in front of me. secondly my queue is perfectly manageable until i get a 4 drink mobile and they’ve all got different cold foams and blonde shots, and thirdly im taking DT orders, cashing out, cafe orders, prepping, trying to clean/break apart things, hot bar, cold bar, warming… its TOO MUCH! also the 3 matchas ordered together… i have one matcha pitcher out at a time. 😭 and even IF the siren allowed batching, it would work bc they’ve got different milks AND like 15 pumps of different syrups bc nobody ACTUALLY likes the taste of matcha AND they complain if the cold foam doesn’t fit perfectly on their light/no ice matcha. and don’t even get me started on stratos… I HAVE TWO FRAP BLENDERS AND ONE MATCHA/COLD FOAM PITCHER. i’m sitting in my car trying to decompress (got off work 45 min ago but stopped to get a drink at 7/11 lol). i get so stressed out. 

i get it, it’s a super busy chain coffee shop. but i feel like if we keep treating it like fast food, we’re going to lose the customer connection aspect of it. even when i have an opportunity, sometimes i don’t have the energy to connect because it’s two baristas struggling to run the floor, prep, clean, breakdown… it’s just so much. and being in a tourist town i have the opportunity to meet people from all over and have great conversations/connections! but i feel like all the extra hoops we jump through really hinder our efficiency and make us kinda unable to connect. i guess the whole point of this is to say i hope my store actually gets a precloser like we’ve been promised. it would help so much i am tired of soloing and drive times being up and feeling anxious about getting fired for poor performance when i know what im doing. plus i cant get fired i need my SCAP benefit to finish this degree 😭
