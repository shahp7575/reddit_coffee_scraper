I had some amazing pasta, wine, and other food at these places:

# 

La barrique - Great and interesting wine. Great food too.

Poldo e gianna osteria - Everything amazing!

Colline emiliane - Amazing ricotta ravioli!

Beppe e i Suoi Formaggi - Awesome wine and great cheeses.

Gandhi 2 Indian - Incredible Indian food. This was the best food I had. Out of this world.

l'elementare pizza -- Pretty good! One non-traditional one was gross, but the buffalo margherita was great.

Alice pizza chain -- great when you need something quick and cheap

Amici pizza -- same as Alice. Good and cheap, but they cut you slices that are 4x the size of what you need, so speak up and be firm.

Caffe trastevere --Amazing pastries with cream and custard. Great coffee too. I found too many places only had nutella-filled things.

da biagio vini e oli -- Great little wine bar in Trastevere. Not trendy or fancy, but pretty good!

# Er Caffettiere -- Great cafe with sandwiches, pastries, and coffee

latteria trastevere -- Interesting wine in a rare quiet side street in Trastevere

Okay not for the not so great:

Rimessa Roscioli restaurant -- It was fine, but way too expensive and fussy for what it is. They even ask for a tip. I felt like I was in the USA/Canada. Most expensive and least impressive place I went to.

hosteria grappolo d'oro -- This place had nice staff, but the food and ambiance were horrible. I do not know how this is highly rated. Bright lighting, American classic rock playing...WTF??

I hope this list is helpful to people traveling to Rome or even locals looking to avoid tourist traps!

We also checked out the hills of Rome and the park that villa Borghese sits in. The hills were okay, but the park was the real highlight!!! It is so beautiful and quiet!!! Great place to break from the chaos of the city.",1,1731182697.0,rome,0,1.0,False

1gniima,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gniima/i38f_am_terrified_of_my_husband43m_even_though_he/,I(38f) am terrified of my husband(43m) even though he would never hit me,"This is going to be insanely long and I am sorry about that. I am trying to make sense of a lot of things that I have never said to anyone. I know this is disjointed and hard to follow. I appreciate even just having the space to write this all down.

Because it‚Äôs easy to only share things from my perspective, I think it is important to get a few relevant facts and a few of my husband‚Äôs frustrations out in the open. Some of these things are just important things to keep in mind to help understand the things that have happened.

1. I am a stay at home mom.

2. I don‚Äôt drive.

3. I am terrible with finances.

4. I have always been an absentminded and messy person. You can generally tell how I am doing emotionally by the state of my ‚Äúpersonal spaces.‚Äù When things are good, spaces are clean with just some clutter here and there. When things are bad, spaces are sometimes downright slovenly.


My husband and I got married because I was pregnant. I really do think we loved each other. I know I loved him very much.

My husband(let‚Äôs call him Will) lived with a female roommate when we met. This was a non issue. His roommate was great and I trusted Will completely.

After about a year of dating, Will started lying to me about the dumbest things. He would say he was going to bed and then stay up playing video games with his female roommate. He would sometimes do favors for her or they would stay up and talk. None of this was an issue. I trusted him and I thought this was normal roommate behavior. I just found it weird that he would lie about it.

The lying started to drive a small wedge between us but I didn‚Äôt really let that wedge grow because I trusted Will. Sure, he was lying. But the things he was lying about didn‚Äôt matter so was it really worth making a big issue about it?

When I got pregnant, we weren‚Äôt ready at all. I worked full time, was in school, and relied on public transit to get to everywhere. Will lived about an hour‚Äôs drive away from me. When we chose to have the baby and move in together, I asked that we look for a place that was midway between my area and his, so that I could keep my job and stay in school. Will drew a circle on a map and said we couldn‚Äôt move outside of a radius of a couple miles from his house. His rationale was that he made the majority of the money and he needed to be close to work. He was the one who had all of the money for first, last, and deposit and he said he would not put money down on an apartment that was any further than the circle. I told him that this would mean I would be spending four plus hours every day on public transit. Will said that it might not even be practical for me to return to a low paying job while having a newborn. I agreed to move inside the circle.

When looking for apartments, Will found out there was a vacancy in his current complex. I wanted to start somewhere fresh, in a location that was new for both of us. I thought we agreed till one day he left me at the house with his roommate and she started selling me on the idea of us moving into their complex. After a few hours of this, she finally broke down and said she had been put up to it by Will. She said she felt like I was being manipulated and didn‚Äôt want to be a part of it and she wanted me to know the truth. I confronted Will about it and he lied until I said I would leave if he didn‚Äôt come clean. He finally admitted that he put her up to it.

It‚Äôs not that I cared that he wanted to advocate for the place he wanted. I just hated that instead of having a conversation with me about what was right for our life, he lied. And he recruited someone else into the lie. This was the first lie that felt like an actual issue.

We ultimately found an apartment and Will had to tell his roommate he was moving out. She wanted him to pay the full current month‚Äôs rent, plus two additional months. Will and I felt this was excessive and he pushed back. She still asked for the two additional months. Will told me he would only pay one additional month. But then he paid her the second additional month behind my back and lied about it when confronted.

We entered into a period where he was lying to me a lot. He would lie for seemingly no reason other than to avoid having a discussion with me. I was pregnant and didn‚Äôt know what to do and we ended up getting married. I convinced myself that the lies weren‚Äôt BAD lies. They were lies I could deal with.

Before giving birth, we had a discussion about who I wanted in the delivery room. We agreed that it would be me, him, and my mother. He asked if his mom could be in the room and I said I would rather not have her there. Honestly, I kind of didn‚Äôt even want MY mother there because we were estranged at the time. Will agreed to talk to his mom and told me several times that I did not have to worry about it because he handled it.

I developed preeclampsia and had to be induced early. The whole thing was kind of scary. I was in unmedicated labor for two nights before the nurses started trying to convince me to take the epidural. I finally agreed and as the needle was being inserted, Will tells me that his mother is crying in the lobby and even though we had already discussed it, he just wanted to see if she can come in. At that point I was exhausted, scared, angry, and felt kind of betrayed. I said ‚Äúfine,‚Äù and he went and got her. His mother joined us and was elated. Will spent most of the rest of my time in labor on his phone. I found out later that he was updating his Facebook status to things like, ‚ÄúKeep going, baby! Push! You‚Äôre almost there!‚Äù and interacting with people in the comments. None of these things were said to me in real life. I would ask him to rub my back through the contractions and he would halfheartedly do it for a few seconds before returning to the couch and his phone.

I lost about half of my blood volume and needed a transfusion. I had to stay in the hospital for three days after giving birth and was told that I would likely need help for several weeks, possibly even a month or more. When we got home, there was almost no help. He had work and made a rule that he couldn‚Äôt get up with her at night because that would affect his work. I agreed with this because we couldn‚Äôt lose his income. He started to feel like he had to be on duty the second he walked in the door, so he made another rule that he would get an hour to decompress after getting home before I asked him anything.

I was alone in this new city and had a newborn so I felt very stuck during the week. We would run errands together on weekends as a family and when we would get home, I would take the baby and her car seat up the stairs to the apartment to get changed, fed, and into her crib. During that time, my husband would bring the groceries into the house. One day, he stopped bringing them into the house and left them on the halfway point of the stairs outside. He said he felt it wasn‚Äôt fair that he had to take them up alone. So he started taking them halfway and I would bring them the rest of the way. Eventually, this felt embarrassing and inconsiderate of our neighbors so I told him to leave the groceries in the car and I would just bring them all the way up myself after feeding and putting down the baby. I know this seems small but I feel like it is relevant to know how petty he gets when he feels like he is doing more than his share. Even if that feeling isn‚Äôt based in anything true.

During this time, he‚Äôs still lying to me about dumb stuff. Saying he didn‚Äôt go to Jack in the Box. Lying about going to a coffee shop with his friends. Lying about things that make no sense to lie about. The lies and isolation hit me hard and I developed pretty severe postpartum depression. I feel like I have to say that I have never felt suicidal before this and have never felt suicidal since. But I felt suicidal then and I told him about it. He told me to sleep on it and literally never brought it up again.

(I‚Äôm going to jump a few years to say that I eventually talked to Will about how it felt to know that I could tell him I wanted to die and he never checked back in to ask if I was okay. We argued about this for months and he eventually bought me a giant Mrs. Field‚Äôs cookie with the words, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù written on it. Lol. No, he didn‚Äôt also ask me to my face and no, we never talked about it.)

As I struggled through postpartum, I finally reached out to a friend and started talking to her about it. Will found me in the closet, crying on the phone and asked me what was happening. I wrapped up the phone call and told him that I just needed someone to help me. He then told me that saying things like this to friends would change the way people looked at him. Once you cause your friends to look at your spouse negatively, you can‚Äôt take it back. He told me that we should talk to each other and not let people‚Äôs opinions into our relationship in ways that could hurt us. He told me his uncle taught him that you can pick a trusted family member of the same sex and discuss it with them, but letting friends into your problems will destroy your marriage. I was dumb as fuck so that made sense to me.

This is already so long and we aren‚Äôt even at the real problems. I am going to have to go through this faster. Things continue going on pretty much the same for about eight years.

Will started making more money and becoming more well known in his field. He worked on several big movies before getting on the project that really changed his career and our lives. He went from making semi-okay money and being relatively unknown to making good money and being very well known in his industry. He still lied during this time. At this point, it‚Äôs a feature of Will. He works and he lies about things.

Once Will started making good money, he expected me to know how to manage it. When we were broke, we were both involved with the finances and jointly knew nothing and fucked up together. But when he started making good money, he expected me to manage it alone. I should have learned how to do this. I didn‚Äôt. I made sure things were paid and that my daughter had everything she needed. When he was on a movie, we could generally stockpile 12k in a couple months without even needing to really cut back. But then the movie would end and he would be off for three months. We would spend that 12k and sometimes go into debt. Then he would get on a movie and we would spend a few weeks/a month getting out of debt and stockpiling 12k again. I didn‚Äôt know how to manage finances when I couldn‚Äôt anticipate what was coming in. I should have sought outside help but I didn‚Äôt see it as a problem till far too late.

Once we started to realize that our finances were wildly mismanaged, we started to set soft budgets. We would set a target amount to go into long term savings and a certain amount to go into savings that would be used after the current job ended. Then we would figure out how much was left for discretionary spending. Will would often spend almost all of the discretionary money without discussing it. But he still expected both savings pots to be funded as normal. There were also weeks when we agreed on the way to spend the discretionary money and he would also buy something for himself, forcing me to either have to transfer money out of savings to cover bills or allow them to lapse and pay them later. Will would get very upset when money was transferred from savings, regardless of whether or not it he spent the discretionary money or even dipped into the money for that week‚Äôs bills. Savings was on autotransfer if funds got low  and I would make sure there was enough money in checking for the bills. So there would be times when he would spend money on something like tickets and clothes for an event and then get pissed at me when ‚Äúmy‚Äù transactions caused the auto-transfers later in the week.

Me not driving cost us a lot of money. My daughter was in an expensive sport that had long practices  almost daily and I used Uber/lift to get us there and anywhere else we needed to go. At one point, we were spending close to 1k/month on Uber alone. I don‚Äôt blame my choice to not learn to drive on anyone. I don‚Äôt even know why I haven‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt think I can answer it honestly, even to myself. I think fear and shame is some of it. I don‚Äôt feel afraid of driving but I do feel afraid of being bad at it and hurting someone. I‚Äôm afraid of my incompetence causing harm to someone else that I can‚Äôt take back. But I don‚Äôt even think that is the full, real answer. All I do know is that I have had years of opportunity and I have not done it. And this choice cost us a lot of money.

I settled into a lot of bad choices. I got tired of fighting about the way his attitude felt like, ‚ÄúBudgets for thee and not for me!‚Äù If he didn‚Äôt want us to pinch pennies together, then I just wouldn‚Äôt pinch pennies either. He was lying to me and was rarely home and I think the truth of it is that living comfortably made that feel okay. Or, maybe not okay but livable. I kind of told myself that I didn‚Äôt need to fight about where my husband was or what he was lying about because my daughter had this amazing life and I could be happy with that. Me being dumb as fuck is a running theme here. I recognize that my own stupidity is maybe even the main problem in all of this.

And then comes Pablo.

Pablo(name changed) is a person who worked in pretty much the same field as my husband. He was one of the more famous guys in this industry and had a huge amount of followers on Instagram(something my husband now noticed and talked about). Pablo was athletic. He was single. And he became Will‚Äôs best friend.

From the moment Will and Pablo became friends, Will‚Äôs attitude toward me changed. It used to feel like we were working things out but I was angry that he kept lying to me. This switched to feeling like Will had this rage that was always bubbling under the surface and would explode during moments of stress. There was one Christmas when I asked him if we could take the money we would normally spend on gifts and use it for a small trip to San Diego. My daughter couldn‚Äôt list a single physical thing she wanted that year and only asked to stay in a hotel. When I brought this up to will, he lost it. He screamed, ‚ÄúWith what money?? With what money??‚Äù and literally backed me into a corner while screaming into my face. Seeing it typed out makes it seem much more reasonable than it felt in the moment. He‚Äôs not tall but I am quite short and he was towering over me as I tried to shrink into a corner while he was screaming directly into my face. It seems tame when typed out, but it didn‚Äôt feel that way in real life. He told me that I was nothing but a nanny and he could hire a nanny to replace me. I told him that I could just take our daughter to spend Christmas in Vegas with my mom and he said he wouldn‚Äôt pay for it.

I want to make it clear how much Will bought for himself during this period of time. Before Christmas, he personally bought himself hundreds of dollars worth of items that cost way more than the SD trip I planned. I admit that I spent a lot of money on Uber and wanted my daughter to be comfortable and have the things she wanted and needed. But ridiculous spending was not a one way street that would make this blow up at me warranted. And, for the record, the Christmas gifts we ultimately bought(agreed upon by him) would have also covered the cost of the trip.

After, I tried to talk about how this altercation scared me. Will would have none of it. He mocked me for being scared and told me that I was trying to make him feel like he was abusive. He would only agree to discuss the situation if I was willing to talk about how I pushed him to that point. I was unwilling to talk about it that way because my entire point was that his reaction should have never been an option. My fear was that this was a point that he COULD be pushed to. In order to feel safe, I needed to know that would never happen again. He refused to talk about it further.

During this time, he was working on the biggest movie of his life. It was a big deal and he found himself going to award shows, doing interviews, and getting invited into rooms that he never thought he would be in. He would invite me to go with him and I just‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt. I am not particularly social by nature but it also felt impossible to stand by someone who I was starting to feel treated me poorly behind closed doors. I know that some people will feel I am overreacting but that altercation felt violent and it was messing with my mind.

Will started feeling angry that I was ‚Äúabandoning‚Äù him when he was finally reaping the rewards of all the years of work he had put into his craft. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt stand by him and have people tell me how great he is and how lucky I am to have him when I didn‚Äôt feel that way. His refusal to talk about what happened made me feel silenced and standing by him made me feel complicit in that silencing.

I am sorry this is so long. I am trying to condense.

My husband got our daughter an iPad and used his AppleID to set it up. I was sitting with her one day and a semi-naked photo of a woman comes through. It was from Pablo.

I open the messages and see that Pablo is bragging about this woman to my husband and sending photos of her cooking for him. Over the course of several days, I see that Pablo talks about women extensively to my husband. There were detailed accounts of sexual encounters, rating/ranking women, sending photos to my husband that appeared to have been meant solely for Pablo‚Äôs eyes. Once, Pablo even described events that ultimately amounted to stalking a woman and showing up at her apartment unannounced. My husband told him that ‚Äúshe knows she misses that dick.‚Äù No condemnation. No push back. I hate even typing this out.

I also found out that Pablo had been either fired or forced out of an adjacent industry because of things that happened in relationships with his colleagues. There was a forum online where Pablo was being discussed as a predator and my husband told Pablo that ‚Äúthe white guys were just jealous they can‚Äôt compete with your black dick.‚Äù

Will is weirdly obsessed with Pablo‚Äôs dick. I have never seen anyone else say shit like that.

When Pablo started sending my husband photos that seemed like they were meant just for Pablo‚Äôs eyes, I felt it was necessary to tell Will that I had seen them. I told him that, as a woman, sending intimate photos to a  person who was not the intended recipient was a huge breach of trust. I told him that I realized that this wasn‚Äôt a conversation I was supposed to be privy to but that his reaction felt disappointing. No one was standing up for those women and telling Pablo to stop. I told him that the things he said were gross and I expected better of him as a married man.

He lost his SHIT. He told me I didn‚Äôt want him to have friends, that I was trying to make him look bad, that this is just how guys talk. He latched on the word ‚Äúgross‚Äù and will randomly remind me of how I called him gross, even to this day. I stand by it. It was gross and weird.

This is getting far too long so I‚Äôm just going to say that this continues for two-ish years. Pablo does weird shit, my husband co-signs, I protest, he blows up and blames me. They are weird-ass best friends against the world. In an industry of mostly women, mind you. During the fucking Me-too movement.

One day, my husband comes to me and tells me he needs to say something. He says that I have always had great intuition and he should have trusted me. He said that there is a woman who has created an instagram page dedicated to exposing Pablo. Apparently she and other women were uniting because of their experience with Pablo. These women had been stalked, bullied, and threatened with the release of their intimate photos. My husband acted gobsmacked. Why? I don‚Äôt know. They literally just wrote down the shit we already knew years ago. But he was pretend gobsmacked and I heard him out. He said he should have listened to me and that it is news to him that Pablo is a bad person. But then he also told me that the woman who started the page is a crazy 22 year old who is doing this to be malicious. That seemed like weird information to know, so I asked him if he had spoken to her. He was like, ‚Äúno! I would never! That‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù I accepted that for a while but my gut kept gnawing at me. I told him that I was sorry to ask again but my intuition has never failed me and it was calling bullshit. He looked me in my eye and told me he never spoke to her. He told me how this is probably just a residual feeling that comes from the lies he has told in the past. He told me that even though he picks up the weight of that burden every day, it is hard on him to know I don‚Äôt trust him when he is telling the truth. He told me that it is probably even harder because my father wasn‚Äôt in my life.

Two days later, the girl makes a post calling my husband out for continuing to contact her and threaten her with legal action. Lol. So not only was he calling her, he was trying to silence her, too.

When I brought this up to Will, he said that he only god involved because she is pretending to be a victim and she didn‚Äôt really feel taken advantage of, she was just trying to get revenge. She, the 22 year old young woman, was trying to vilify him, the 40 year old married man with all the industry contacts and good reputation. He would only agree to talk about it if we talked about how blindsided he was and how shocked he must be to find out his friend is trash. It was so crazy to watch something major happen to you and others and to have that reality completely denied. The person I needed to discuss this with would only discuss it with me if we talked about it as though the way it happened wasn‚Äôt the way it happened. Wild.

He would also tell me he didn‚Äôt have time to discuss any of this with me but would then be in Zooms with other industry people talking about what a betrayal this is and how he was as shocked as they were. Fucking HOW? My husband was pretty much the one person who DID know. And the stupid piety he had afterward was unbearable. There was an event he was going to and he wanted to wear his Time‚Äôs Up pin and asked me to help pin it to his lapel. I wanted to stab him with it.

I don‚Äôt know why this broke me as much as it did. Something inside of me just gave up. I stopped leaving the house. I became a full recluse. I became so afraid of seeing anyone we jointly knew. My husband knew all of this ahead of time. So did I. Neither of us said shit. I didn‚Äôt track those women down on socials and let them know what was being said and shared about them. I just rolled over and let it all happen. Will was getting these messages two years prior to when all of this came out publicly. That was two years of trauma that might not have happened to someone if either of us had said something. But we didn‚Äôt and now Will‚Äôs pontificating on the internet so that people will tell him how great he is.

I started getting heart palpitations that were ultimately diagnosed as panic attacks. I would be sitting in a room and all of a sudden my heart rate would shoot up to 155 bpm on my Fitbit. I started gaining a crazy amount of weight due to inactivity.
I only left the house when absolutely necessary.

We were driving to visit my family for Thanksgiving later that year and it rained the whole day. We were driving faster than I felt was safe, so I asked Will to slow down. He snapped at me about being the one who knew how to drive. He increased his speed after a while and I had to weigh the benefit of saying something again. I knew Will had only sped up to spite me for saying something to begin with. Saying something again might get him to slow, but it also could cause him to lash out more. But I was getting freaked out so I said something. He snipped at me again about not knowing how to drive and continued at an unsafe pace. He took one hand off the wheel and started tapping out a beat. It felt like he was trying to be petty. We hit a puddle of water, slid, hit the center divide, then spun out on the freeway. Thankfully, we were all okay. Bystanders helped us get to the side of the road and everything ended up alright.

It terrifies me that I know we got into an accident because he wanted to punish me. It terrifies me that I can‚Äôt prove it. It terrifies me that my daughter was in the car. I am disgusted that I should have taken action that day, and I haven‚Äôt. I am disgusted that all I have done is make sure she doesn‚Äôt ride with him anymore. I have become so ineffective and incompetent and dependent. Leaving the house feels hard. Talking to a stranger feels hard. I am a shell of the person I used to be and when I look back at the things that happened, I don‚Äôt think anyone would think it was that bad. I don‚Äôt know why I have been completely immobilized by a relationship that doesn‚Äôt even look that bad when you write it out.

My husband asked for us to not discuss the relationship with others, but I found out he had been discussing me all along. He would take pictures and video of rooms and spaces I allowed to get filthy so that people will understand what he has to deal with. He talked about our dissolving relationship with female coworkers and pretended I was trying to stop him from getting support when I felt betrayed. I‚Äôm not the one who made that rule. He was. I was just shocked to find out I was the only one expected to actually do it. He talked about me to others the entire time.

I‚Äôm not even really seeking advice about the relationship. I feel like I am struggling to understand what even happened here. I keep asking myself, ‚ÄúIs this normal? Are these fights the type of things people just go through in a marriage? Am I making these things bigger than they need to be? Why do these feel like major blows when it doesn‚Äôt even seem that bad on paper?‚Äù

My uncle got cancer many years ago and we were eventually told it was terminal. We went to thanksgiving with them a few months after getting that news and had a good time. The topic of my grandmother‚Äôs housekeeping came up and led to all of us discussing whether we personally want to keep an immaculate home. I said that I didn‚Äôt feel like everything needed to be pristine, others shared their views, and we all moved on. After, Will told me that my uncle pulled him to the side and asked, ‚ÄúWhat was up with that?‚Äù He told me that my uncle told him that he needed to nip this in the bud because it was a slippery slope. He said that my uncle was disappointed to hear I didn‚Äôt prioritize keeping things neat.

This immediately sounded like bullshit. My uncle didn‚Äôt give AF about stuff like that. My aunt didn‚Äôt keep THEIR house in pristine condition. His own kids and THEIR wives didn‚Äôt live like that. But for some reason, he pulled my husband to the side and said he was disappointed in ME? Will lied about it when confronted and then continued lying until I said we would just have to call my uncle to confirm. He then admitted he lied and said that he had been pushed to a breaking point and was looking for backup anywhere we could find it. From that point, he would only engage in conversation about this if I would discuss it the ways I pushed him to that point.

My uncle died a few years later and I told Will over the phone because he was out. When he got home, he went straight into Zoom meetings. After, he told me that a friend was having a rough day with work and he was going to sit on the porch and talk with him(Covid). When his friend left, my husband texted to let me know he would be going on a drive to clear his head. I later texted him to say that it was disappointing to know that a family member could die and he still won‚Äôt do anything to support me. He gave a halfhearted apology and then blamed me for it. From that point, he refused to talk about it if we did not talk about the ways I make it impossible to support me.

Earlier this year, I was trying to get him to understand why I feel so afraid of him. I tried to get him to understand that I never know where the line is with him. He will cross lines of decency and then blame me for it and that scares me. I tried to explain to him that if he will lie to me about my terminally ill uncle being disappointed in me, what won‚Äôt he lie about? He then told me that ACTUALLY, my uncle had said all of those things and even MORE things that he didn‚Äôt bring up because he didn‚Äôt want to hurt my feelings. He said that he only retracted his statement because he didn‚Äôt want to get my uncle in trouble. This was complete bullshit. I got off the phone and didn‚Äôt know what to do. I was married to a man who would double down on lies about my dead uncle, to gain absolutely nothing.

We were arguing one day and he told me that if anyone heard about the things that have happened between us, no one would believe me. I told him that this felt like a threat and he immediately wanted me to know that he wasn‚Äôt trying to threaten me. But that is what is so scary. I know it wasn‚Äôt a threat. It‚Äôs a fact. No one would believe me. It‚Äôs just true.

I don‚Äôt even know what I am asking or why I typed all of this out. I thought I would re-read it and know why I feel like I have been run over by a truck but it all seems so small when it is written out. I don‚Äôt know what to do, I can‚Äôt seem to get myself off the floor, I feel like I have been beaten up and he has never laid a finger on me. It‚Äôs just many, many instances like the ones I have described. I don‚Äôt know why the cumulative effect has been so hard for me to deal with personally. I am terrified of him and I know he would never strike me. Has anyone ever been in a situation like this and allowed yourself to become ineffective as a result? What steps did you take to start feeling competent again? I feel like I don‚Äôt even know where to begin detangling what my life has become.

made Yesterday a post of My first 72 Hour Fast, wich turned into 80 Hours.  
Felt Pretty good after braking it, had a Glass of Water with a table Spoon of Viniger and two eggs as brakefest, toghther with non sweetend Tea and than a hand full of Cashews Nuts, than after 3 hours, still, felt fine, Inflamation was likely Zero, and felt good.  
Well, untill...  
Peanuts. I mentioned it in the last post further down, and today I feel kinda a bit meh, joints ach and Alergies are slightly Present with skin feeling irritated.  
So, Long Story Short.  
I need Advice on what to avoid in General for when You have Leaky Gut, and what type of Diet would suit it combinded to go in out out with Fasting, for Me to heal the Laky Gut Syndrom and hopefully can sometime soon live a Normal life again, been dealing with it for more than a Decade.  
And sometimes things like that get Frustrating, when You read tons about it and they just say ""oh yea nuts are fine""... Just to get on Here and a very Helpful Person just says ""oh yea most are fine but Peanuts, they're in a nutshell Poison if You got that and likely going to Trigger some, depends on state of how bad the Leaky gut is, trigger a Food Alergic reaction.""  
...  
Also, not like I started Yesterday with Changing the Diet and all, started almost 4 years ago and been having a somewhat decent plan, wich I used to keep the inflmation down often and even used it as Pre Fasting Preparation and post it too.   
Anyways,   
Rant and Ramble aside, I'm going to list what I eat when I do the pre fast prep and wanted to get a Second Opinion if these things are Good, or if I should avoid them like the Peanuts, also likely in Geneal till this is fixed.  
.  
.  
.  
So, time to list those tings I eat when on that Pre Diet Plan:  
 (Also Helps Me just to reduce inflamation and wich I used for a year pretty often)  
    
\- Eggs (mild seasoning, just some herbs and else wise salt)  
\- Herbal Tea Blend (No sugar, no Honey)  
\- Chaga (As a Tea, Non Sweetend)  
\- Coffee (Home Brew Beans, with 1 Tea Spoon Raw Honey)  
\- Nuts (Avoiding Peanuts from Now on, Thanks a Lot for that Info Alone!)  
\- Cucumber Salad (with some salt and Apple Cyder)  
\- CannedTuna (for sure one of the best things I can stomech if I can't anything as Dinner)  
\- Carrots (Raw and peeled of course, or as Juice)  
\- Apples  
\- Bananas  
\- Broccoli (Boiled, toghther with canned Tuna is good)  
\- Cauliflower (Boilled)  
\- Oranges (Most of the time as Juice, Home Made of course)  
\- Rice (I've heard 50/50 things about it, not sure, but it does not effect Me to Bad, I think?)  
\- Additional: Zinc, Magnisuim, Vitemin Suppliment Blend  
.  
.  
.  
Also, now to some Foods wich I've heard should be Good on a Diet like this, yet I'm kinda on the Fecne about them, unsure and have mixed results, yet can't rally say since I've might had some other bad things at the times in wich Changed those results and Tinted them.   
.  
So Here are those things:

\- Oatmeal (with Coconut Milk)  
\- Coconut Milk/Flesh  
\- Raisins  
\- Dried figs  
\- Strawberries   
\- Blueberries,   
\- Cherries  
\- Grapes  
\- Rice (Yes, the one I'm on the Fence the most)  
\- Dark Chocolate  
\- Tomatoes (I hear so much 50 50 on those, yet they also state, Avoid Night Shade Plants, wich cause more  
  inflamation, especually if You've got Leaky gut)

.  
.  
Alright, now to the How to Brake the Fast:   
I've heard a few ways, and decided how I stated above,   
Glas of Water with one Tea Spoon Apple Cyder, than 2 scrambled Eggs (No seasoning at all, only used Olive oil else wise to make them), a Glass of Herbal Tea (No Sweetent), than had about a handfull of Cashews Nuts. Should've ate some other nuts the next time I was Hungery instead of Peeeeeanuts, ugh, and than, had some Rice, Cucumbur Salad with Canned tuna for Dinner. Else wise, Chaga Tea twice that day, Probiotics starting again post fast, and else wise Vitamin Suppliment, Zinc and Magnisium once a day.  
...  
Fast itself it was just Water and some Salt, wich I know know, there are a few more things to Add, not just salt but Electrolids, Petasuim and another thing, besides water, where Is till could need some enlightenmend about and maybe some recommendations.   
.  
.  
.  
Also, in case anyone has some recomendations on what to Avoid and what Should be included and is Fine Food wise, Please let Me know.  
.  
.  
.  
I hope that long of an Post with this much Detail and Text isn't Bad in this Sub, I just like to go into Details and not to miss out on Certain Important Things, somtimes (often) mixed with also a lot of minor not so important ones.  
...  
I just Say Peanuts, on the Minor ones.

1gni2o8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1gni2o8/my_experience_using_the_uvbrite_water_bottle/,My Experience Using the UVBrite Water Bottle ‚Äì Worth It or Not?,"I recently decided to try out the **UVBrite Water Bottle**, a **self-purifying water bottle that kills 99% of germs and bacteria**. I‚Äôve been using it for about a month, and since there aren‚Äôt too many in-depth reviews out there, I figured I‚Äôd share my experience to help others who might be considering it. I‚Äôll go over what I like, what I don‚Äôt, and whether it‚Äôs worth the price tag.

# Why I Decided to Get a UVBrite Water Bottle

I‚Äôve been using reusable bottles for years, but I‚Äôve always had issues with them. After a while, they start to smell weird, and washing them daily is a hassle. Plus, I like the idea of having a bottle I can fill up almost anywhere and not worry about germs. That‚Äôs what caught my eye with the **UVBrite water bottle**. This bottle uses **UV-C light technology to kill up to 99.99% of germs and bacteria** in the water, making it feel like a reliable choice for someone like me who‚Äôs always on the go. Whether I‚Äôm at the gym, hiking, or traveling, I figured this bottle could make life easier.

The fact that this tech is used in places like hospitals and water treatment facilities made it even more convincing. I don‚Äôt have to keep buying filters or chemicals to purify the water. Just fill it, press a button, and it‚Äôs ready to drink.

# First Impressions ‚Äì Design and Quality

When I first got my hands on the UVBrite, I was impressed. It has a solid, high-quality feel with a stainless-steel, double-walled body. The bottle is insulated, which means it keeps drinks cold or hot for hours, and it‚Äôs a bit heavier than a regular plastic bottle, but it feels durable. It comes with a **one-button design** ‚Äì super simple to use. Press once for a 90-second cycle (good for tap water) or hold it down for a 180-second cycle, which is recommended for water from less reliable sources, like streams or public fountains.

I‚Äôve taken it to work, to the gym, and on a few hikes, and it holds up well. No leaks, no weird tastes ‚Äì just fresh water every time.

# UV-C Purification in Action

The core feature of the **UVBrite water bottle** is the **UV-C light purification**, which eliminates most bacteria, viruses, and other harmful pathogens. The science behind UV-C light is pretty solid ‚Äì it works by breaking down the DNA of microbes, making them unable to reproduce or cause harm. It‚Äôs the same technology that‚Äôs been used for years in hospitals and even by NASA, so I felt pretty confident in its effectiveness.

After using it with various water sources ‚Äì tap water, public fountains, and even from a clear stream on a hike ‚Äì I‚Äôve had zero issues with the water quality. No weird tastes or smells, and I haven‚Äôt had any stomach issues (a worry when drinking from public sources). The bottle‚Äôs **self-purifying feature** also activates a cleaning cycle every six hours, which has kept it from getting that stale smell other bottles develop over time.

# What‚Äôs It Like to Use Daily?

Using the UVBrite every day has been easy and convenient. The automatic cleaning cycle means I don‚Äôt need to worry about washing it daily, and since I tend to leave water in my bottle overnight, it‚Äôs nice knowing it won‚Äôt get that gross ‚Äúold water‚Äù taste. The insulation keeps my water cold throughout the day, which is great during long hikes or busy workdays.

As for charging, a full charge lasts for about 60 purification cycles, which translates to roughly 9 gallons of water. I charge it every couple of weeks, and it charges quickly with a standard USB cord.

[**You can read more about it here.**](https://www.elprsdnt.com/8SWM4W1/DCC1P68/?uid=38397&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# Pros and Cons

# Pros

1. **Kills 99.99% of Germs and Bacteria**: The UV-C light effectively purifies the water without filters or chemicals.
2. **Self-Cleaning**: It‚Äôs one less thing to worry about. The automatic self-cleaning every six hours keeps the bottle fresh.
3. **Insulation Keeps Drinks Hot or Cold**: This has been a nice bonus. I‚Äôve used it for both hot coffee and cold water, and it holds the temperature well.
4. **Rechargeable Battery**: With around 60 cycles on one charge, I don‚Äôt have to charge it constantly.

# Cons

1. **Heavier Than Plastic Bottles**: Because it‚Äôs stainless steel and insulated, it‚Äôs a bit bulkier than your average bottle.
2. **Price**: It‚Äôs more expensive than regular water bottles, but you‚Äôre paying for the tech and convenience, which might be worth it if you value clean water.
3. **Only Works with Clear Water**: It‚Äôs not meant to purify murky or muddy water, so it‚Äôs best for clear sources like tap or filtered water.

# Battery Life and Durability

I was a bit concerned about the battery life and whether it would last with daily use, but so far, it‚Äôs been great. I charge it about once every couple of weeks. The USB charging feature makes it convenient since I can charge it almost anywhere. The bottle itself is pretty tough ‚Äì it‚Äôs survived a few drops and still looks as good as new.

# Is It Worth the Price?

The **UVBrite water bottle** is definitely on the pricier side, but considering that it‚Äôs both a durable water bottle and a water purifier, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth it. If you‚Äôre someone who needs a convenient way to get clean water on the go, this bottle is a great solution. I‚Äôve already saved a bit by not buying bottled water, and it feels good knowing I‚Äôm cutting down on plastic waste too.

If you‚Äôre debating the cost, think about how much you‚Äôd spend on bottled water or replacement filters over time. Plus, the **UV-C light technology** gives you the flexibility to drink safely from various sources without constantly worrying about germs.

# Final Thoughts

After using the UVBrite for a month, I can say it‚Äôs a solid choice if you‚Äôre looking for a **self-purifying water bottle** that you don‚Äôt have to worry about constantly cleaning. The UV-C light does a great job of keeping the water fresh, and the self-cleaning feature means I‚Äôm not dealing with bacteria buildup or strange tastes.

It‚Äôs not for everyone ‚Äì if you just need a simple, lightweight bottle, this might not be the best fit. But if you value clean, purified water on the go and like the idea of a low-maintenance bottle, the UVBrite could be a good investment. It‚Äôs been a convenient addition to my routine, and I‚Äôm happy with the quality and reliability it offers.

Whether you‚Äôre into hiking, working out, traveling, or just want to stop worrying about the germs in your water, the **UVBrite water bottle** has been a game-changer for me. It‚Äôs not the cheapest option, but for anyone who‚Äôs serious about water quality, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth considering.",1,1731181155.0,HealthProductsNatural,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been on the same birth control for 15 years (tri-sprintec) and I really want to stop taking it. The only reason I‚Äôve been on it for the past few years is because I‚Äôm terrified of losing my hair from it. I‚Äôve seen and read the horror stories.

I have incredibly long dense hair and always have. I do not want to risk losing any of it from stopping the pill. I regret going on it because of this possible side effect that doctors don‚Äôt tell you about before hand. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve read of a single story of anyone that stopped it who HASN‚ÄôT lost hair, but does that mean there‚Äôs no way to prevent it?

I know the cause is the fluctuation of hormones. Is there anything that can be taken before stopping it into after stopping the pill to help regulate or balance hormones to prevent the shed? Supplements? I‚Äôve heard macca root may help but cannot confirm. 

I already eat a very healthy diet. I haven‚Äôt had sugar in over 6 years and mostly just eat proteins high in fat.  I take collagen in my coffee. I don‚Äôt know if that would help but I figure it‚Äôs a good start.

At the moment of writing this review, this resort is a Category D when it comes to point pricing meaning it can vary from 25,000 to 35,000 pts/night, depending on the dates. Our dates were during the off peak season, so 25,000 pts/night x 5 nights = 125,000 pts/total.

Preferred Club: The day before our stay, I chatted with a Hyatt rep via the app to attach a Club Access Award to our reservation in hopes to get Preferred Club access. Upon checking in, it seemed that the award was not noticed since our initial upgrade was to the standard room that we booked but with an ocean view in building 4. My Explorist status was noticed and I was thanked for my loyalty. I was offered paid upgrades to Preferred Club access rooms but we declined. The person that was checking us in was very kind and ended up giving us Preferred Club Access free of charge. We were moved to a standard room with an ocean view in building 7. Preferred Club Access is a great perk for this resort. The perks that my wife and I enjoyed the most for having Preferred Club Access were the Preferred Club Lounge and the Preferred Club Pool. The Lounge offers small bites for breakfast and lunch, desserts, bread, juices, and coffee. There are couches and TVs as well. There is also a bar inside the lounge which offers higher end liquors. We loved having access to this bar because the other bars tend to get busy at times, especially in the evening, so we rarely had to wait at this one. The Preferred Club Pool was great. It had many seats, and the pool was never packed like the activity pool is. The attendants at the Preferred Club Pool were also fantastic, especially Francisco. As soon as we walked near the pool he would ask if we needed a lounger and would always bring us towels. There are other perks with having Preferred Club Access like having access to Seaside Grill for breakfast and having access to the Preferred Club Beach Area. Seaside Grill for breakfast offers a la carte meals whereas the other breakfast option, Market Cafe, is only a buffet where it can get crowded. The Preferred Club Beach Area has less loungers so it feels less crowded, and you get access to the Preferred Club Beach Bar.

Food:

* All the restaurants are tasty and we didn't have a single bad meal.
* Servers were fantastic and attentive.
* Barefoot Grill during lunch does get quite busy, be prepared to wait.

Pools:

* We only really stayed at the Preferred Club Pool because all of the pools didn't have any available loungers when we looked. This resort allows people to save loungers early in the morning by placing personal belongings on them which makes it hard to find any open loungers throughout the day.
* Water temperature was comfortable, none of the pools are heated. The water isn't freezing but it does feel a bit cold at first.

Beach:

* The beach here is great
* Seaweed is cleaned up early in the morning and in the afternoon, making the sand very pleasant to walk through/ look at.
* The sea was warm during our stay which made it very enjoyable to swim in.
* There are beach vendors that come by to sell things but they are not pushy.

Gym:

* The gym is larger and better than the gym at Moxche.
* 5 treadmills and a good amount of cable machines and free weights. There are also a couple of bikes and ellipticals.

Overall, this is a fantastic resort, easily one of our favorites.

1gnhv53,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gnhv53/aita_if_i_blow_up_on_my_wife/,AITA If I Blow Up On My Wife?,"AITA for being at my wits end with my wife being a slob and not helping out more?

Some back story,

I work 50-60 hours/week, Mon-Fri. I normally wake up around 2:30am and begin my work day at 4am. I get home about 5pm. I shower, eat dinner, catch up with the wife about how our day went/spend time with our daughter and watch some TV. Then in bed for 7:30-8pm. So I'm not home much during the work week.

My wife works part time. Some weeks she gets 1 shift in a week (4 hour shifts), some weeks she gets 3 shifts in a week (so 16 hours tops), some weeks she doesn't get any shifts.

She cooks dinner daily and brings our daughter to school and picks her up (5 min walk each way). Either than making dinner, spending a total of 20 mins each day getting/picking our daughter up from school, along with 1 hr in the morning getting her ready for school, she has no other tasks in her day that prevent her from doing any other ""chores"". So that's a grand total of 2 hours of her day that she is occupied with getting our child to school and making dinner. Either than that, she is free.

Yet I spend my weekends doing laundry, cleaning the house and various other tasks that need to be done (like cutting the grass, landscaping, routine house maintenance and such). I feel like I never stop and get to truely unwind, yet my wife has hardly anything to do during her days but she ALWAYS has an excuse to have no time to clean up, do the dishes, ect.

Some examples are that her dresser is packed full of clothes ontop of it that look like they can topple over at any second. Always a sink full of dishes. Dirty cups and plates left in the living room. Her night stand always has empty soda cans and coffee cups on it. Don't even get me started at the state of the inside of her vehicle.

I've even have a list on the fridge with tasks on them and she never works away at the list (like cleaning her dresser, putting her planter baskets away at the end of the season, cleaning her car interior ect).

Every time I ask her to pick up the slack (in a nice way), she gets mad about it and says she was too busy dealing with our daughter (she is 6, she is super easy to watch) or doing other tasks (tasks that would take like 2 mins, like wiping the countes down). Yet in reality, she just sits on her phone watching Tiktok or playing Sims on her PC all day long. 

AITA if I blow up on her? I know she will play victim and be mad at me for a few weeks (I have had blow ups before about this) but part of me can't keep my frustration bottled in. How can I get her to pick up the pace? Even if I do blow up, she only picks up the slack for a week or two, then falls back into her same routine. I'm tired of not having people over because I am embarrassed at the state of my house.


Edit: Wife can't work full-time yet, as daycare for our daughter costs more than that my wife would make working full time at minimum wage. She works min wage jobs, as she has no college or degrees. She worked full-time before we had our daughter and I truly believe she will work full-time again once our daughter is old enough to no longer need a babysitter. But she was always a slob though.",2,1731180595.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

So, I thought I‚Äôd share some tips on what to look for when selecting a mug warmer to help you make the best decision for your daily coffee, tea, or hot chocolate.

Here are a few key factors to consider:

1. **Temperature Control:** The ability to adjust the temperature is essential. Some warmers have preset temperatures, while others offer customizable settings, allowing you to find the perfect warmth for your drink.
2. **Power Source:** Mug warmers can be powered by wall plugs, rechargeable batteries, or even USB. Choose one that fits your lifestyle ‚Äî a plug-in warmer is great for a desk, while a battery-powered one offers more portability.
3. **Size & Compatibility:** Make sure the warmer can accommodate your favorite mugs. Some warmers have larger heating surfaces to fit bigger or non-standard-sized mugs, while others are designed for standard coffee cups.
4. **Safety Features:** Look for warmers with automatic shut-off features to prevent overheating. This is especially important for long-term safety and energy efficiency.
5. **Design & Durability:** Since you‚Äôll be using it regularly, choose a warmer made with high-quality, durable materials. Also, consider the design ‚Äî some come with sleek, modern aesthetics while others feature more functional designs.
6. **Ease of Cleaning:** A waterproof heating plate or non-stick surface can make cleaning much easier. Be sure to pick a warmer that‚Äôs easy to maintain.

Hope this helps. If you need any advice, please feel free to comment.

This was a situation i found myself in on and on again.
I (31m) grew up in a abusive houshold. i absolutely HATE violence and abuse any kind of form. May it be screaming or worse.

i have never been the way i was with my ex. And it makes me think. And i am ashamed of it.

I often felt crazy so i wrote diary about the situations i was in. Now, 1Month after the breakup i find myself going through these written pages and i can't believe how much of an imposter syndrome i am in. I really though and still think that i was the bad guy. And that i still want her back (not going tho)

I would like to tell you about last christmas. (She ruined both we had)
Christmas was always important to me as i always had terrible holydays and i knew she had to so i wanted to make it special.
So after we learned that christmas was a huge trigger point i then told her that we should not do something big last year. Just the two of us and some gold food.
She agreed

on the 25th dec she woke up in the morning and was pissed. She dreamed that i cheated on her. So i spent the whole morning comforting her and cuddling her. Later i stood up and went to get me a coffee and i spend some time with my two cats. Greeting them and cuddling them. Also making Selfies as i felt so handsome in the new necklace she gave me the day before. Both of these things triggered her. She hated when i had my attention on my cats. And she was mad at me making selfies without her in it.

Locking herself in my room and later on writing me the following: 

""It's the way you did greet your cat's its not that you show them affection but the quality of it. I also wanna be called beautiful every morning...""

I tried my BEST. That day. Comforting, reassuring and swallowing down my pride and my ego cause i was on the edge of loosing myself cause all i wanted since i am A CHILD IS A PEACEFULL CHRISTMAS.

Well she dragged that type of problem for the whole day till i completely lost it in the evening. Yelling at her.
I was so mad that i found myself wanting to punch a wall which i think is an absolute no go. So i grabbed my jacked cause i already could not stand the way i acted with the screaming and i headed out. So there i was. Sitting alone in a park at christmas eve at 1 am.
Bawling my eyes out. i had to leave MY APARTEMENT because of her.

EVERYTHING was my fault apparently.
She was cooking for 3 hours. Making a new curry.
I communicated if she wanted me to help because we had fights before because i helped and she the  felt like i dont trust her because i was always the better cook. 
She told me no . So i sat down and checked in from time to time.
It was my fault. ""i left her cooking for 3 hours...""

NO MATTER WHAT I DID, it was wrong.

When i got back from my stroll she had an additude.
""I'm thinking about breaking up with you when u scream like that again.""
Right then and there i should have stood my ground. but i didn't. ""i have every right to be mad... you yelled at me.""

What about me? What about the fact that you created a whole ass fake problem from the void itself and projected it on to me the whole day because i PETTED MY CATS?

it's nothing worth that i was calm the whole day huh....

i have never been this way.

i am sad.
angry.
confused.

i suffered from the same abuse at home. and because of the fact i am so used to it, i stayed cause it felt familiar.

Each yard has its own eccentric mechanic, ready to share ‚Äúforbidden knowledge‚Äù in exchange for something valuable - this can be an actual skill where item X can be used to replace item Y for 80% efficiency. this allows your engineers to grow in value as the tech tree can go from 100 to 1000, with 20 different possible quick fixes. This is what a game cannot sim for a player, so in this case, as with hackers, you need to build skills.

Stale Coffee Machines in Corporate Stations - Every corporate space station has a break room with a perpetually out-of-order coffee machine, leading to a secondary caffeine economy or DIY brewing stations that employees set up, potentially becoming quest locations for rare beans smuggled from Earth. Would be fun if there is this unseen corp that is supposed to maintain these. also ice cream machines are always broken.

Emergency Grapple Points for ‚ÄòSoft‚Äô Landings - In some poorer space colonies, emergency platforms or retractable grapples are set up for malfunctioning shuttles to attempt landings, providing a unique emergency mechanic for players in tricky landing situations. This could be the ""last ditch"" if things fail.

Hitchhiking Stations - Small outposts designated for stranded space travelers, equipped with minimal supplies and ancient tablets filled with graffiti from past drifters. These stations offer shelter but come with superstitions and risks. places with no purpose except to remind you that you're lost.

Ancient Derelict Ship Graveyards with Spiritual Significance - Areas of space filled with derelict ships, regarded with quasi-religious reverence. These eerie zones have their own rituals or superstitions, giving rise to special encounters or atmospheric storytelling. There can be some people that subscribe to this, some tolerate it, and some attack it, and likewise, adherents who will attack those who won't give it credit etc.

Wall Art Made from Micrometeor Scars - Some habs or stations take pride in their micrometeor impacts, using nanotech to polish these scars into patterns that form ‚Äúnatural‚Äù space artwork, tied to local stories or mysteries - so large meteor events will become tales, as well as ""space scares"" and other superstitions like sailors have.

He's home now but now we also found out he has diabetes so that's another thing to worry about. I just went grocery shopping and I bought plenty of fresh food and proteins that I know will be ok for him to eat. We still have cereals and white rice but I can't bring myself to throw those out with food prices the way they are. So those foods will be eaten by the kids and me until they're gone and then I'll be able to buy healthier options that my husband will be able to enjoy as well. Since I went shopping today, I'm going to meal prep tomorrow and I will be ready to start again on Monday.

Diet

* Reduce the amount of rice, pasta, white bread I eat
* Limit the eating out (including junk food, I'll leave that for the kids)
* Eat more protein at every meal (something I'm really bad at)
* Use smaller plates to help with portion control
* Water intake goal is at least half a gallon of water daily (I only drink water anyway since I don't drink soda or coffee)

Workouts

* Follow the Iron/Fuel hybrid calendar by Caroline Girvan
* Wake up early to go for a walk before my main workout
* Start running again  - start with a mile and work my way back up to 3-4 miles

Take daily progress pic first thing in the morning and weigh myself and take measurements weekly on Sunday mornings. Read 10 pages daily. Meditate daily and work on not using my phone to scroll on social media before bed.

These are my observations and tips. ,"Just some ways Ive found are effective in dealing with this affliction. I do NOT claim that these will work for everyone. You have to find what works for you. And i certainly do not have it all figured out. 


1) Carbs are the enemy. Especially early in the day. A heavy lunch will certainly lead to afternoon episodes. Light lunches are my best bet. I usually do a salad. 

2) Edibles. I have a friend who grows his own weed, and makes me consistent and very low dose gummies. I take one every night about 2 hours before bed. This has completely stopped my sleep paralysis. If i miss a night, demons in my room. 

3) When i was first diagnosed, i went on a health kick. I got a dog and started walking him every morning. I gave up coffee. I cut out most processed foods. Ended up losing 160lbs( im 6‚Äô6‚Äù and currently 390) This was such a great decision. I felt great, had enough endorphins to counteract how screwed i felt by the universe, went to bed happy. For awhile. Eventually, I missed the coffee and realized i needed caffeine to stay sharp. I settled in to a more lax routine with the dog(I recommend getting a dog highly though, just in general lol) i put some weight back on and started having increased episodes. 

4) Stay Vigilant. Yes, we are afflicted with a crappy disease and its not fair. So try to get past that and just keep going(easier said then done, im not a mental health expert) But I found that when im getting more and more lazy, tired, exhausted, depressed etc, the only solution is to keep at it. Get up and move. Have a nap or some coffee, have a rest or a walk, then think about what i need next. I recently had my Dr increase my meds(modafinil) and now i have more energy in the reservoir. I use it when its available, sleep when its not. The schedule isnt really up to me. 

5) Get a hobby. I‚Äôve found that we cant live normal lives. Its just not there for us. So adjust. I took up woodworking so that when im not at work, im still busy. Sitting around watching tv or YT or TikTok or whatever is a waste of energy. If im awake and alert, im gonna use that to my advantage. Do something to use that energy. Try to make sure that when i am tired, im not just skimming REM sleep, but totally shutting down from exhaustion. 

6) Snort coke. Just kidding. But i will save one of my pills for the rare occasion when i HAVE to be awake for something social. Wedding? Long drive? Friends Bday? Im taking that pill at like 6pm and going out fully stimulated. I dont do this often cause ill be wired all night and trying to fix it the next few days. But the alternative is to miss these social functions completely, or leave them to go nap, or worse‚Ä¶pass out in the middle of them. Which has happened. 

7) Throw conventions out the window. You have a burst of energy at 3am? Rearrange your room the way you always wanted(just try to be quiet). Its a beautiful spring day and everyone‚Äôs going to the park! Youre tired. So go to bed. Forcing it wont work anyway. Again, its unfair, it sucks, it‚Äôs isolating. Its also reality. You cant fight reality. And if you feel your battery draining as you do something, wrap it up and be okay with the fact that you may not pick it up again for awhile. 

None of this is medically sound. I have no expertise or knowledge. Just stuff that has worked for me and some of it might help someone. What im not mentioning is all the things i tried that did not work. Most of them consisted of fighting it and trying to keep a normal schedule. The trickiest part is when my sleep/wake and energy and conventional lifestyle all line up for a few days. Gives me false hope for a normal life. Because it will all break apart again soon. If you take one piece of advice from me that i learned the hard way‚Ä¶.just turn into the skid. Go with the weird flow. Id love to hear some tips from others who have a little piece of this figured out. Or tell me why im wrong. Thanks and good luck!",1,1731178843.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False

Hi! I am looking primarily for friendship, potentially open to more if it occurs naturally, but not searching for anything more specifically. 

A bit about the type of person I‚Äôm looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+(this is a hard boundary). Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I‚Äôm not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). I am looking for someone kind, fun, maybe a little bit funny, and genuine. Other than that, I‚Äôm very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific ‚Äútype‚Äù of person! I‚Äôm looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I‚Äôm not *looking* for something serious, nor do I have any intention of relocating or anything like that. 



A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn‚Äôt?) - I‚Äôm definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I‚Äôm a little obsessed with Jellycats. Also a little obsessed with Bobs Burgers.  I love coffee. I‚Äôm very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to try and stay active, and get at least a bit of exercise daily. 
Here are a couple photos of me https://imgur.com/a/5P3SHJq


If you think this sounds like something you‚Äôd be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Please only message me if you are going to include some context - tell me about yourself, start a conversation based on something I‚Äôve mentioned in my post, it‚Äôs up to you but I will likely not spend any effort on ‚Äúhey‚Äù or smalltalk responses.

1gnh4fx,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1gnh4fx/employee_sickmat_leave_questions/,Employee sick/mat leave questions,"Hi all

My MIL owns a coffee shop/bakery in England, she previously was the manager but bought it from the old owner in February this year. She has an employee who has been off sick since the end of June with back pain - before she was signed off, she announced she is pregnant. Her back pain was an issue before she got pregnant, so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs classed as a pregnancy related illness. My MIL tried to implement several things to help her at work such as no washing up and lifting heavy things, and shorter shifts. This already wasn‚Äôt ideal as she cannot do 90% of the things required for the job (all she can do is take orders and make coffee) but she understood adjustments should be made so put these in place. She then went off sick and has been ever since. 

This employee has her own business doing nails where she is hunched over all day and is still doing this very often, as well as just generally being out and about and doing things all the time - my MIL is really struggling to afford her SSP as the business had a lot of problems she wasn‚Äôt told about when she took it over, so it‚Äôs quite upsetting to see her doing all these normal things but getting doctors notes saying she‚Äôs unable to simply stand (or sit!) behind the bar and take orders. 

She is currently getting SSP and is due to go on maternity leave in late November - from my understanding, she is allowed to go on maternity leave and then straight back onto SSP after which we are certain she will do if she can - is this correct? 

Is there any way she can be let go after her mat leave ends or would that be pregnancy discrimination? She was close friends with my wife for a number of years, her parents and fianc√© are VERY well off and we know she doesn‚Äôt need the money as she is fully supported at home. Obviously she will get whatever she is entitled to but she has already accrued a load of holiday as she‚Äôs been off on SSP which she‚Äôll be claiming, and then the added SSP when she is back which the business could really do with not paying for. If it‚Äôs relevant, she has been employed by the business for 2+ years but my MIL took it over in Feb and changed the company registered name on the gov site so I believe technically everyone has only been employed since February. 

I really hate to sound like someone who is trying to scam someone out of what they are entitled to but my MIL is working 60+ hours a week to try and fix this business and she is here taking nearly ¬£500 a month that she doesn‚Äôt need, while working nearly full time at her other self employed job.

Since about 4 or so years I discovered I was Bi no's gay. But with a highly more preference for men. Let's say a 30-70%. But since I moved alone I started to get more into women. Didn't have much sex with them, but I really want to be with one. That happened until I met my husband. So I become obsessed with him and forgot my ""women interest"" for a bit.

Now, about 6 months ago, the desire for women started afloating again, and with more intensity every month.

One week ago I started a new job, and one girl who is a colleague of mine it's really attractive and she seems very interested in me. We are planning to go for a coffee later next week. I'm craving her so very much.

So, as the title says, I think I'm becoming more straight than be too, because I'm not seeing my husband as sexualy attractive as I was, and also other men. I changed the porn I watch, and in my future vision of my life I imagine myself being with a girl, forming a family, and those things.
The more time passes the less interest I'm having in men.

So, idk what to do, what to think. Don't have many friends to talk about this so here I am, looking for some advice and opinions about the subject, and if some of you went for some sort of similar dilemma.

Hi!

Trying to get my life together after a breakup and would like to meet new friends. I'm an introvert and don't really like putting myself out there but I think it would be a nice change. I'm 25F, in case I needed to say that.

I do have some friends here and there but our work schedules don't really match so it's hard to meet more than once a month. I have a full time job from M-F, but I'm usually free after 3pm on weekdays. I do tend to have weekends open but I do like planning ahead of time.

I LOVE cats, I make dumb jokes, I cry easily, I like the gamble of a claw machine at an arcade, I love getting dessert after a meal, I get scared of meeting new people, I love cute things... If we click and get along, I do hope to make some meaningful friendships.

Some of my interests, in no particular order, include...

1. Anime (Digimon, Sakura Card Captor, Dragon Ball, One Piece, Mermaid Melody, Kamikaze Kaitou Jean, JJK, Attack on Titan, Naruto, Fullmetal Alchemist, Ouran Host Club, Kimi Ni Todoke, Made In the Abyss, Detective Conan, Shugo Chara, Inuyasha, Haikyuu, Yuri on Ice... The list goes on)

2. Food! I love cooking for my family and trying new foods. It has always been a way for me to connect with people. Some foods I enjoy making at home include, pasta, pizza, roasts, Kbbq, burger, wings, japanese curry, mapo tofu, vegetable stir fry... 

3. Coffee and Tea. Although I'm not a pro, I do enjoy my morning cup of coffee! I have a small coffee station at home where I can hand grind beans and make espresso shots. My current favorite tea is the Fresh Lemon Black Tea from Feng Cha.

4. Working out. I find that being able to exercise at the gym has helped a lot with my mental health and even if we can be gym buddies, I do enjoy going on long walks at Miramar Lake or at a park.

5. Hanging out and talking. Now that it's colder and gets much darker faster, I try to soak up some sun in the mornings to help my seasonal depression. I have a picnic blanket I could bring, we could sit under the sun and just yap away at whatever. Drinks and snacks would definitely make the experience more fun.

6. Gaming. I'm not particularly great but I recently got back into Harvest Moon, Friends of Mineral Town on the Switch. It's what's been keeping me from going crazy at home.

1. pornography - set the tone of rodeo, amazing storytelling for t.I., amazing second half (my favorite second half from any Travis song)

2. the ends - birds may not be the best Scott album, but this intro combined two parts into one. Travis flows and rapping were on point, and an andre 3k feature.

3. stargazing - the vibe on this song is unmatched to be honest, but I prefer the lyricism on the ends and the storytelling on pornography.

4. hyaena - amazing rapping, unique style production, and it‚Äôs tough to be honest to try and rank it above these songs.

5. the prayer - great beat, questionable mixing, dark vibes, one of my favorites off dbr but it‚Äôs objectively not as good as a song as the 4 above.

  
Outros:

1. Coffee bean - easily the best outro in my opinion. The autumn and melancholy vibe the song creates along with travis getting personal about his relationship and mental struggles makes this song the best. 

2. til further notice - 21 savage verse was good, but it felt out of place in a song like til further notice. I would‚Äôve preferred t.I. or juicy j. Main thing holding it back from #1 is the lyricism and storytelling a song like coffee bean has, and the fact the 21 verse was out of place. 

3. apple pie - great production, interesting storytelling about him not needing his mother‚Äôs apple pie. I just prefer the two songs above more.

4. wonderful - great song, just not on the level of the 3 above

5. bacc, the bonus track off dbr, poor mixing, the lyrics don‚Äôt really hit hard. If grey was considered to be the outro, I‚Äôd probably have it at #4. ",1,1731178046.0,travisscott,0,1.0,False

‚ú®Searching for a Detailed, Romantic Slice of Life Scenario With Added Drama and Angst Slow-Burn - Long-Term Scenario ‚ú®

‚ú®Female looking for anyone writing as Male‚ú®

I‚Äôm not at all replacing any current partners but simply looking to add to my writing scenarios and outlets! 


I LOVE a slow burn, all the angst and drama that comes with it, whether that be as a friends to lover trope (one of my favourites!), forbidden love to strangers to lovers just meeting for the first time or a complete difference in personalities, and aesthetics, but with a mutual deep connection and understanding of one another. Simply like say a grumpy x sunshine, black cat x golden retriever, sort of trope; one where on the exterior the male character can appear cut off, a little tough perhaps, and grumpy but with her he‚Äôs so vastly different. He‚Äôs vulnerable, gentle, and understanding; something he isn‚Äôt with just everyone else. She helps him to become softer, much, much more gentle all round, whilst he helps her to become less of a pushover or people pleaser. 

For this scenario, I‚Äôm simply looking to mix the world of fame with romance in very much a Slice of Life way, with lots of slow-burning romance and added drama! - I feel you can never have too much of that and adds a lot to the storyline itself! Something that‚Äôs very much realistic where the writing tugs on your heart strings, after all everything isn‚Äôt always going to be wonderful and happy 100% of the time! It has all the similarities of a general Slice of Life premise with the two characters falling for one another yet with added depth of the implications of their fame and recognition within the public eye. From potential scrutiny of the public themselves - even just the simple grazing of their hands - both on social media and from news outlets, to paparazzi and reporters desperate to follow and generate money from their every move. Whilst falling for one another they have the added pressure of external influences to consider; less privacy and security of that of any other, ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, couple out there within the early stages of their relationship. Those that are able to head out on dates, even just for coffee, without being recognised! It just brings *so* much added drama, which I love!!! There‚Äôs just so many ways to navigate it all which is exciting! 

I have no ‚Äòset in stone‚Äô concepts so that we‚Äôre able to come up with an idea entirely together to ensure we‚Äôre both happy, content and invested in what we‚Äôre writing - after all it is a partnership! Especially as this is *your* character to write as however you please and see for! Particularly so that it‚Äôs your choice entirely as to *why* they are famous. For my character, I am envisioning her as being like this ‚Äòrelatively new onto the music scene‚Äô, but very much high in demand and taking the world of music by storm, kind of pop princess singer songwriter?


For some rough outlines, what line of work is your within? Are they also within that same field of work or entirely opposing careers? From actors, to singers and songwriters, or perhaps more within the athletic department? Why have their paths crossed? Strangers who have met at an event or even perhaps two individuals who have always known of one another? Or perhaps a chance meeting when purposefully brought together for a certain situation, event or work opportunity?

I roleplay in first person and would consider myself to be very detailed and descriptive; so I‚Äôm hoping to find someone of a similar match. I really enjoy a lot of back and forth rapid replies, rather than say one or two messages a week, but of course appreciate that that can‚Äôt always be the case! - just simply that I‚Äôm often able to provide those quick responses, particularly in the evenings, and that I‚Äôm also seeking this in a writing partner too! I‚Äôve been writing overall for around ten years; including with the same writing partner during that timeframe until the start of the year - so I‚Äôm well versed within the longevity of writing with the same partner hahahaha! 

Please let me know if you‚Äôre interested by private message, leaving behind your age too - as again I‚Äôm only looking to write with someone of a similar age range - also leaving behind a little information and some insight into what your own interests and any ideas you may have!

Currently, I‚Äôm living in Stamford, Connecticut, on a 9-month teaching fellowship, and I‚Äôm ready to find someone who‚Äôs not only my partner but my best friend. Think of a cozy evening with coffee, shared laughter, and someone who truly *sees* you‚Äîthat‚Äôs the kind of connection I‚Äôm after.

**About Me:**  
I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù with deep brown eyes that can catch every detail in a room, and medium-length dark brown hair that‚Äôs always ready for a good breeze. I have a soft spot for self-expression, which is why you‚Äôll find three tattoos‚Äîeach meaningful, one on my shoulder (a rose), one on my hand (a bluebird), and one on my forearm (a lilac). I live a balanced, healthy lifestyle‚Äîno smoking, no drama, and alcohol only in moderation (because, let‚Äôs be real, it‚Äôs expensive!).

When I‚Äôm not working, you can find me writing, drawing, or immersing myself in synthwave music. My soul is rooted in the past, which means *Gossip Girl* (original series only) is my guilty pleasure, and my top six films include *Dogfight*, *Cruel Intentions*, and *Stand By Me*‚Äîthere‚Äôs something timeless and special about them. If you appreciate that nostalgia, we‚Äôll vibe instantly.

**What I Want:**  
I‚Äôm craving something real. A partner who feels like home. Someone who I can laugh with over the silliest things, share quiet moments of affection, and just be completely ourselves around. I want us to build a life where we‚Äôre not just lovers but best friends who can weather anything together. If you believe in building a relationship based on trust, genuine connection, and a bit of playful romance, then we‚Äôll get along beautifully.

**About You:**

* **Age:** 28-37, 5'10"" or taller
* **Build:** Slim, fit, or lean (but truly, it‚Äôs your energy that matters most)
* **Lifestyle:** Non-smoker, drug-free, and moderate drinking is cool
* **Location:** Connecticut or nearby (US/Canada preferred)
* **Seeking:** A monogamous, long-term relationship with marriage potential
* **Communication:** You‚Äôre reliable and know that actions speak louder than words. A good morning or goodnight text goes a long way in showing you care.

If you‚Äôre emotionally available, kind-hearted, and ready to create something lasting, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Please include a photo, and I‚Äôll happily share one back if we connect. Let‚Äôs see if we‚Äôre the match we‚Äôve been waiting for‚ÄîI'm ready to build something real. üíã",0,1731177752.0,r4r,1,0.25,False

1gnghc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1gnghc8/i_am_now_convinced_my_aunt_is_an_absolute/,I am now convinced my Aunt is an absolute narcissist ,"Sorry, if this isn't allowed, but I could find no other subreddits here, and I need to vent.

I don't know if it was acquired situational narcissism after she married rich, of if she was always a narcissist and it only came out after she married into money.

But she is the most self-centered, most inconsiderate, selfish, entitled, bossy, and utterly obnoxious person in my life now, and I'm at the end of my rope with her, but my mom is a big enabler of her, and makes every damn excuse under the book for her sister's bad behavior even when her behavior hurts my mom.  

I remember a few months ago, we went on a weekend vacation to the beach with her. And I was expecting a quiet and peaceful vacation, but it was utterly ruined by my aun't's obnoxious and selfish behavior. I have autism, and I'm incredibly sensitive to loud noises. My Aunt is extremely loud. She was on the seat in front of me, and she was so loud that I nearly had a panic attack. At one point I asked her very nicely to be a little quieter.

She turned and gave me the dirtiest look you can imagine, and started yelling at me that she HAD to talk loud because she was old and couldn't hear and when I was old and couldn't hear that I would 'understand her' I later learned that my sister once had a migraine with my aunt around, and she asked my aunt to be quieter as well, and my aunt got mad at her and gave her the same rant, and refused to lower her voice. Knowing VERY well my sister had a migraine. 

The vacation was one of the worse experiences of my life, and it was because of her behavior, she was so loud, bossy, selfish, and obnoxious and I was stressed to the hilt. I remember at one point we ran out of toilet paper and had to get some. There were five of us and the hotel provided one roll. She screamed at us for being so wasteful, and we were using too much and began to rant on how nobody needed more than 2 sheets. She was utterly insane!

Then there was the yard sale business. We live in a rural country area, and the houses are far apart, and not good for yard sales. But my aunt kept insisting we have a yard sale, and we all tried to tell her what a bad idea it was, but NOPE come hell or high water she refused to give in. 

My mom was scheduled for hernia surgery, and my aunt fully knew this. A few weeks before the surgery, she made my mom have it at our house. (My mom, me, and my other aunt live together, because the economy sucks.) Well, we sold NOTHING because we are too far out in the country. My Aunt left early, and guess who had to put away the heavy tables and boxes? YES, my mom who was scheduled for HERNIA surgery, and I had to lift and carry them back into our shed. I asked my mom why my aunt couldn't have helped.

""She was tired.""

My mom and my other aunt just enable her. We just had another yard sale at her house, and didn't make money, and at the end of it, we all had to put away the heavy paintings, tables, and boxes, and carry it up to a HILL to her shed. She later 'thanked' us and told her she was 'grateful' to us because she couldn't have put up the stuff because of her age and breathing. (She's a very, very heavy smoker) it was complete bullshit for her to sit on her ass and let us do the work.

She thinks she knows everything, and one time she pissed off a doctor so much because she told him he didn't know anything that he left the room! One time at a steak house with a mini-bar (I wasn't there, but I heard stories) she nearly embarrassed everyone to death, because she was incredibly rude to the poor waitress, because she insisted on white grapefruit juice, despite them all telling her a mini-bar wouldn't have that. But her entitlement is INSANE.

I remember years ago, where she threw a tantrum because a place, we were at didn't have coffee and had the manager come over, so she could sign a form to get coffee in restaurant. I nearly died right then and there of embarrassment. 

She's also heavily wrinkled, but think she looks decades younger, and tells me that her youngest sister has more wrinkles than her. And talks about how 'young' she looks a lot. The woman is so wrinkled, she looks like she's MELTING. Smoking and drinking heavily for decades will do that to you 

I could go on and on. But she is just a person that I can't stand anymore. My sister told me she didn't used to be this bad, so I don't know if it was acquired narcissism, or it only came out after marrying a guy with money. 

But my mom and my other aunt are such enablers and I think they just let her get her way because it's easier than standing up to her and calling out her selfish behavior. 

Sorry, if this isn't the place to post about narcissistic aunts, but I can't stand her behavior anymore I needed to vent, but I have no ",2,1731176841.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False
1gngfsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1gngfsp/didnt_realize_before_marriage_that_we_had/,"Didn't realize before marriage that we had incompatible lifestyles, how do I carve out a piece for me again?","My (29F) husband (33M) and I have been married for 6 years and have 3 children under 6 years old. I took the kids to the library this morning and felt such sad nostalgia while we were there. I take them most weekends, but today it really hit me that I miss the lifestyle I had before I got married. I used to go to the library a lot when I was single to use its resources. When I lived alone, I never owned a television or had internet in my home. If I needed to order something online or wanted to browse the internet, I would take my laptop and go to the local library or coffee shop. I read a lot of books, went on walks, worked out, cooked, knitted, invited friends over, and any other manner of low tech modes of entertaining myself.

I knew my husband was a techie guy when we got married. We did not cohabitate before marriage for multiple reasons with religion being one of them. I did not realize how expensive and noisy it would be to be married to someone who constantly needs access to the internet and screens. He is the very image of smartphone addiction. He is always and I mean ALWAYS on that damned phone: while sitting with our children, while having dinner with my family, in bed (even in the middle of the night). He always has a podcast or tiktok playing. I absolutely loathe tiktok. It sounds like a walkie talkie constantly blaring in my home. When we spend time together, it feels like it has to involve a screen. He refuses walks and gets annoyed when I've suggested carving out a no smartphones time in the day.

In general, I lived so simply before. I didn't have very much stuff, thrifted or made household items, made food from scratch, never used credit, had no debt, and always drove an older vehicle that was in good shape. Since marriage, all of that has been inverted. He opens credit cards and rolls his eyes when I want to cash flow everything. It feels like amazon packages arrive at our house every day and it usually just ends up as clutter. He bought a used but large vehicle without asking me, and I hate how much of our monthly budget goes to car payments. He acts like he's too good for secondhand items. When I was looking for a laptop on facebook marketplace, he impulse purchased an $800 laptop for me without checking if it's what I wanted. I finally blew up at him and said I hated the laptop because he steamrolled me with the purchase when I said I was looking for something used and cheap, and it was was overpowered for the needs I had, which were essentially paying bills and managing documents. I returned it and bought one I'm much happier with for $100 secondhand.

I have no desire to divorce, so please dont recommend that. I'm sure this is just part of the growing pains of a young marriage, but I do wish I could have some of my simple, low tech life back. I didn't realize I was living such an unusually minimalistic lifestyle previously and what a shock it would be to live with someone with greater technology preferences and comparative maximalism. I'm living an inflated lifestyle with too many things and too much noise, and it's becoming overwhelming to the point that feels like it's the life of another person, and I'm getting depressed.

1gngfjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1gngfjf/coffee_resting/,Coffee Resting,"It seems like every roaster has their own philosophy based on their style of roasting - how long coffees should rest post roast to ensure the highest quality brews. 

My question is - why would some roasters feel differently when roasting beans to similar profiles?  For instance, a local roaster will tell me their filter roasts (light or light to medium) should rest 2-3 days before grinding. Then when you go to Flowerchild, they might recommend 2-3 weeks to 2-3 MONTHS for the best experience.

How is this so variable? Is it a difference in roaster education or is it truly a difference in bean and roast profile? Should we assume most light roast beans should rest 2-3 weeks or is it true that each bean is really that unique?

Background: left Pgh for 10 years, need to get reacquainted with the city, having bad depression after a miscarriage as a solo mother by choice (& the election)

Inspired by: that person who made the Pgh Coffee Shop Map & my own desire to address & maneuver the above dynamics

I wanted to start at City Books bc I grew up in Mt. Oliver & remembered it being in the South Side.  Lo & Behold it still exists.  Great conversation with the owner who holds the same ethical & political views as myself.

They publish a bi-annual book recommendation list which would be great for people wanting to get into reading &/or expand.

Got the Farmers Latte at Colombino upon recommendation of the worker & am SO EXCITED to brew this tomorrow.  Lattee was good, space had a good vibe but I opted to walk the neighborhood instead.  

Sorry I‚Äôm not much of a reviewer, maybe they will get better in the future.

Did it help my miscarriage depression? Yes.
Did it help me get reacquainted with the city? Yes.

What I should have done different: got lunch at Peppis.  Paid to park ;) (i forgot)

I passed my Med last year and the Red Cross first aid course and retained some of that info (CPR, WARTS, the basic stuff).

1gnga4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1gnga4t/long_term_stomach_issue/,Long Term Stomach Issue ,"Hi , 

Looking for some guidance. 

I'm 36 generally healthy, exercise twice a week. Diet is ok though I do consume a lot of sugar and coffee during the week. Work in trades 50+ hours a week and definitely lean on the coffee and sugar to keep me going.

Ever since I started drinking alcohol at age 15 I would vomit multiple times the next day. Up to 20-30 times before it would settle down. Would also have a headache and very bad nauseu. It felt like I was trapped in a cycle of extreme nausea and then vomiting was a relief from that. And then the nausea would slowly build again.  

The amount of alcohol I drank didn't seem matter , One or Ten 

I went to a gastro specialist in my home country , got an endoscopy which showed nothing. I did test positive for H. pylori and underwent treatment for it.

Moved countries.

I stopped drinking about 4 years ago. At that point I would only have 2 beers max. Mostly only one. But I could still get sick a few times the next day if I was unlucky.


Now at 36 having not drank for a few years , I have started experiencing the nauseau and vomiting again. Without alcohol though I will experience really bad nauseu but only vomit a few times over hours. 

Went to the family doctor here and they test for H Pylori again - still have it so went through treatment again. Tested 2 weeks ago and I'm negative.

This morning woke up after a restless sleep and felt extreme nausea and have almost vomited several times.


Really hoping someone can point me in the right direction 

Thanks

1gng7s2,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1gng7s2/hotel_breakfasts_sigh/,Hotel breakfasts. Sigh.,"There are few things more demoralising as a vegan than a hotel breakfast experience.

Everyone else around you is having access to more breakfast options than they probably have in a whole year.

Meanwhile, you're lucky if you can get plant milk for your coffee and a bit of bread with jam on it.

I've been vegan for a few years already, and eventually one grows a thick skin, so this kind of things doesn't bother me too much anymore, but my gf is a rather new vegan, and I know how these situations feel in the beginning.

It doesn't help that her omni father is travelling with us. As nice as he is, he's probably thinking I'm a bad influence for her (because she went vegan after meeting me) and the cause of her not having enough options to eat.

Sorry for the little rant.

PS: I don't normally pay extra for hotel breakfast as I know this will be the case. This time it was just included in the price.

PPS: of course the ones having the worst time in this scenario are the animals exploited and killed for everyone else to have their breakfast. I'm vegan for the animals and will always be.",107,1731176124.0,vegan,48,0.9,False
1gng7j3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MugWarmers/comments/1gng7j3/best_mug_warmers_2024/,Best Mug Warmers 2024,"Lately, I‚Äôve had the chance to review over 70 different mug warmers, so I figured it‚Äôd be useful to share what I found and offer some tips if you‚Äôre in the market for one.

Here‚Äôs a quick guide on what to consider before buying:

* **Temperature Control**: Look for options that allow adjusting temperature, as everyone has a different ‚Äúperfect‚Äù warmth level.
* **Automatic Shut-Off**: A safety feature that‚Äôs great if you forget to turn it off after use.
* **Battery or Plug-in**: Decide if you want a portable, battery-operated mug or a plug-in warmer for stationary use.
* **Size and Compatibility**: Make sure the warmer fits your favorite mug and any unique mug shapes you might use.
* **Durability and Cleaning**: A scratch-resistant, easy-to-clean surface can save hassle down the road.

# Some notable options

1. **Ember Mug 2 (14oz) ‚Äì Best overall electric mug** \- The Ember Mug 2 is all about keeping your drink just right. It maintains a steady temperature between 120¬∞F and 145¬∞F for up to 80 minutes on its own, or all day if you keep it on its charging coaster. With or without the app, it defaults to a cozy 135¬∞F, making it ideal for regular use. It automatically detects when there‚Äôs liquid, and shuts off when empty‚Äîa handy power-saver. Its scratch-resistant ceramic finish and waterproof design add extra durability. The LED light is a nice touch, letting you know your drink‚Äôs ready without guesswork.
2. **Nextboom Nextmug ‚Äì Best value electric mug -** The Nextboom Nextmug gives you three temperature settings: Warm (130¬∞F), Hot (140¬∞F), and Piping (150¬∞F), so it‚Äôs great if you like options. It‚Äôs got a good battery life, and the LED indicator lights let you know both the temperature and battery status at a glance. This mug has a built-in control button, which means you can skip the app, and its coaster keeps it charged up. The Nextmug is a solid choice for anyone who wants a quality heated mug without spending a fortune.
3. **Lerat Coffee Mug Warmer** ‚Äì **Best heating plate** \- For those wanting a more budget-friendly option, the Lerat Coffee Mug Warmer delivers good functionality. It has a 4.8-inch heating plate that fits most mugs and offers three heat settings (104¬∞F, 131¬∞F, 149¬∞F). Plus, it‚Äôs got an 8-hour auto shut-off feature for safety, which is a nice addition for the price. A red indicator light lets you know when the plate‚Äôs hot, and it even comes with an 8oz ceramic mug. Simple, effective, and wallet-friendly, it‚Äôs ideal for use at home or the office.

  
I hope this helps to a make a good quick decision for what you need.

1gng5qw,https://i.redd.it/m2zrp71z2xzd1.jpeg,Is something eating my African fig? ,"Hello all! First time looking after plants here.

This African fig (‚Äúficus cyathistipula‚Äù) arrived about a week ago along with 12 other plants (we are making a push to get some green in the house as it looks so beautiful).

At first, I think I overwatered her a little (see below) and she was too cold, but now we have her by the window in a warmer room and grouped with all the other plants she seems to be cheering up.

She has drainage (she‚Äôs in her plastic pot with holes in the bottom, on a plate for now because the cost to add on a decorative pot made me choke on my coffee when we were ordering). I gave her about a small mug of water 2x in a week after she arrived because she seemed very dry, but now I‚Äôm holding off as Google suggested that was too much‚Ä¶

However I‚Äôve just seen this on one of her leaves. I can‚Äôt tell what it is, or what might have caused it. A little terrified in case it could spread further on her or on the other plant babies we‚Äôve just welcomed in.

Any help figuring out what they are would be appreciated hugely!",1,1731175970.0,plantclinic,1,1.0,False
