At first, he was super charming — the kind of guy who remembered your coffee order, sent good-morning texts, and made you feel like you were the only person in the world. But once I was hooked, he started showing his real self.
He’d get mad if I didn’t reply right away, accuse me of flirting with coworkers, and “jokingly” insult my appearance. Every time I tried to talk about how it made me feel, he’d flip it around and say I was being dramatic or too sensitive. Classic gaslighting.
Eventually, I found out he was cheating — and not even subtle about it. He left his phone open once and there were literal screenshots of him messaging other girls saying I was “crazy” and “too much work.” I confronted him, he denied it, then admitted it but somehow made it my fault because I “wasn’t affectionate enough.” I left him the same night.
Fast forward about six months later — I’m finally in therapy, getting my confidence back, and living peacefully. Then, out of nowhere, I get a DM from a girl saying she’s dating Jake now and asking if I had any advice about “dealing with his moods.” I didn’t respond. I just blocked her.
Now, here’s the karma part: about a month later, mutual friends told me he lost his job after blowing up on his manager for “disrespecting him.” Apparently, he also got dumped — the same girl messaged one of my friends saying he tried the same manipulation tactics on her and she found out he was talking to multiple girls again.
Now he’s back to posting sad-boy stories about “fake women” and “loyalty being dead.”
My friends say I should’ve warned the new girlfriend, but honestly, I didn’t owe her emotional labor or another round of dealing with his drama. Karma did the job for me.

Marcus has the ability to heal wounds. The kingdom has been under attack by vampires that want to drain the land of it's magic. The kingdom seeks to protect nature and they value living in harmony with it.

**ChatGPT said:**

That’s a wonderful setup — rich with mythic imagery, emotional depth, and a strong romantic core. Before I dive in: would you like me to **start with a full first chapter** (to establish tone, world, and characters), or create a **detailed outline**for the entire novel first (with key plot points, romance arc, and worldbuilding)?

Either way, here’s a short **teaser summary** of what your story could become — just to show the tone and direction:



**Title:** ***Wings of Moonfire***

**Genre: Romantic Fantasy**

**Teaser Summary:**

In the kingdom of Elyndra, where moonlight weaves through enchanted forests and the bond between humans and beasts is sacred, Princess **Agnes Valoryn** rides her purple, winged unicorn **Flora** into battle. A Valkyrie warrior with the rare gift of speaking to animals, Agnes has always placed duty before desire. But when the vampires of the Blood Veil begin draining Elyndra’s magic, Agnes is forced to ally with **Marcus Darrin**, the King’s most trusted guard—a healer with secrets of his own.

Marcus’s loyalty to King Titan is unwavering, but his heart has already betrayed him. Drawn to Agnes’s fierce compassion and quiet strength, he risks treason for a single stolen glance. Their bond deepens as war looms, their pegasi and hearts soaring in unison beneath the twin moons. But when a dark prophecy reveals that one of them must sacrifice their power to save the land, love becomes both their salvation and their curse.

Together, they must decide: will they fight for duty, or for each other?



If you’d like, I can now:

1. 🗺️ Write a **chapter-by-chapter outline** (with romantic beats and fantasy tension),
2. 📖 Write **Chapter One** in full (vivid prose, character intros, worldbuilding), or
3. 💞 Do both — outline first, then draft the opening chapter.

Which would you prefer?

**You said:**

do both please

**ChatGPT said:**

Perfect — let’s build *Wings of Moonfire* from the ground up.  
Below is a **full novel outline**, followed by a complete **Chapter One** to set the tone and introduce Agnes, Marcus, and the magic of Elyndra.



**🌙 WINGS OF MOONFIRE**

***A Romantic Fantasy Novel by \[You\]***



**NOVEL OUTLINE**

**Setting:**

The Kingdom of **Elyndra**, a lush, moonlit realm thriving on ancient magic drawn from nature itself. Humans live alongside mystical creatures—pegasi, unicorns, dryads, and spirits of the wind. The kingdom’s vitality depends on harmony with nature’s energy, which the invading **Vampires of the Blood Veil** seek to drain to fuel their eternal hunger.

**Magic System:**

* **Valkyries** are divine-born warriors tied to the natural elements, often bonded to winged mounts.
* **Healing magic** is a sacred art, rare among mortals, often reserved for the royal guard.
* Magic in Elyndra is symbiotic with the land — imbalance or destruction weakens it.



**MAIN CHARACTERS**

**Princess Agnes Valoryn (30)**

* Height: 5’3”, stocky and strong from years of training.
* Coffee-colored skin, white hair braided with silver cords.
* Valkyrie warrior and heir to Elyndra’s eastern citadel.
* Gift: Communication with animals and elemental empathy.
* Mount: *Flora*, a lavender-hued unicorn with crystalline wings and a gentle but fierce temperament.

**Marcus Darrin (35)**

* Height: 5’10”, broad-shouldered, muscular.
* Skin: deep onyx-black; hair: dark navy blue.
* Captain of the King’s Guard; stoic, disciplined, loyal.
* Gift: Healing — both physical and spiritual, but it drains his life force.
* Mount: *Thor*, a grey pegasus with storm-tipped feathers.

**King Titan of Elyndra**

* Powerful and protective ruler who sees love as a distraction from duty.
* Secretly fears Agnes’s growing power could destabilize the monarchy.

**Antagonists: The Blood Veil**

* Vampires who feed on magic rather than blood.
* Their leader, **Seraphine**, is an ancient vampiress who once loved a Valkyrie — and seeks to reclaim that lost power by extinguishing Elyndra’s light.



**PLOT OVERVIEW**

**ACT I: Shadows on the Wind**

* Agnes rides into battle against the first vampire assault.
* She meets Marcus again after years apart — he’s now the King’s closest guard.
* Their bond rekindles through shared combat and mutual respect.
* The vampires’ attacks grow stronger, draining the forests and creatures.
* Agnes discovers she can hear the *dying voices* of the land.

**ACT II: Hearts and Oaths**

* Agnes and Marcus train together, learning to blend healing and elemental magic.
* Their connection deepens; stolen glances and midnight confessions reveal forbidden love.
* The King warns Marcus: “Do not let my daughter’s heart sway your oath.”
* A mission gone wrong forces Marcus to use forbidden healing to save Agnes, binding their souls.
* Seraphine appears, taunting Agnes — revealing that her magic is the key to saving or destroying the land.

**ACT III: Blood and Moonfire**

* The vampires breach the capital. Elyndra begins to die.
* Agnes learns her bond with Flora can restore the kingdom’s magic — but only if she sacrifices her Valkyrie power.
* Marcus offers his life to heal the land instead.
* They fight side by side, Thor and Flora carrying them into the storm of battle.
* Agnes’s love awakens an ancient form of Moonfire magic that purifies both the vampires and the land.
* In the end, Marcus survives — barely — and they choose a quieter life among the forests, rebuilding Elyndra in peace.



**📖 CHAPTER ONE: THE SKY BLEEDS SILVER**

The storm broke over the Valley of Mirrors like a roar from the gods.

Agnes gripped Flora’s silver reins, the unicorn’s wings slicing through the clouds as lightning forked across the violet sky. Her braid whipped against her armor, white hair glowing in the stormlight. Below, the battlefield shimmered — a river of steel and blood where the vampires had already begun their assault.

“Easy, my heart,” she murmured to Flora, voice steady despite the thunder.  
*They’re here again. The ones who drink the trees dry.*

Flora’s mind brushed against hers, gentle and fierce all at once. *Then we end them, as we did before.*

Agnes smiled. “We end them all.”

The pair dove. The air screamed around them as they plunged toward the enemy line — a blur of lavender wings and silver flame. Agnes raised her spear, moonlight trailing from its tip like liquid fire. The first vampire barely saw her coming before Flora’s hooves struck, crushing bone and shadow.

Then came the scream.

Agnes turned — and froze.

Through the storm rode a familiar figure astride a grey pegasus, armor glinting with blue runes. The sight hit her harder than the lightning. **Marcus.**

Five years had passed since she’d last seen him — the King’s quiet shadow, the man whose eyes could heal and wound all at once. Now he was here, cutting through the enemy ranks like the storm itself, Thor’s wings flaring with raw power.

When his gaze found hers through the chaos, the battle seemed to still.  
A thousand words passed in silence.

Then Flora tossed her head impatiently. *He’s watching you again.*

Agnes’s cheeks warmed beneath her helm. “He always did.”

Marcus guided Thor beside her midair, blades flashing. “Princess,” he said over the roar of the wind, “you shouldn’t be here.”

She smirked. “Tell that to the vampires.”

He almost smiled — almost. Then his expression hardened, and he reached across the space between them, his hand brushing her arm. For a heartbeat, warmth spread through her — his healing magic, faint but unmistakable. He was checking if she was wounded.

“I’m fine,” she said softly. “But thank you.”

Below them, the vampires regrouped, hissing in the dark mist. Flora’s wings shimmered brighter, defiant. The ground trembled with ancient magic, the land itself whispering to Agnes in warning.

*They come for the heart of Elyndra,* it breathed through her mind. *For the magic that binds us.*

Agnes met Marcus’s eyes.  
“The King needs to hear this,” she said. “They’re not just here to conquer. They’re here to unmake us.”

He nodded grimly. “Then we’ll stop them together.”

And as thunder split the sky, Flora and Thor rose — twin beacons of moonfire and stormlight, side by side in defiance of the darkness.

For the first time in years, Agnes allowed herself to hope.



Would you like me to continue with **Chapter Two: “The Healer’s Oath”**, where Marcus and Agnes reunite in the royal citadel, explore the tension between duty and desire, and the King’s disapproval begins to emerge?

1o26vv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/disabledgamers/comments/1o26vv0/games_that_are_playable_using_only_a_tobii_eye/,Games that are playable using only a Tobii Eye Tracker or a mouse,"In replying to a recent post about playing games with the Tobii Eye Tracker, I realized that I’ve spent several months putting together a game collection intended specifically for that purpose. I don’t have the use of either of my hands, so none of these games require regular keyboard input. Some may benefit from, or even require, the occasional button press such as the Escape key to bring up a menu, but I handle that with voice activation software like VoiceAttack. I don’t rely on any real-time or frequent keyboard presses.  

I went through my Steam library with the aid of an AI to identify all the games I own that work with this type of control scheme. I did my best to skim and edit the list manually, but I can’t guarantee that every single game meets the criteria perfectly, since I acquired many of them through bundles and trades and haven’t had the chance to play them all. Still, it was a real challenge figuring out what I could play, so I hope this helps other gamers who are limited to using either an eye tracker or just a mouse with one hand.  

One caveat: the eye tracker does make it possible to play virtually any game through adaptive software like Mill Mouse, which can simulate joystick, controller, and keyboard inputs. However, the games I’ve listed here are designed to work directly with a mouse cursor and basic clicks, for simplicity’s sake.

TLDR: $1350/month for a private bedroom in a 2B 1BR in West Roxbury, shared w 25M roommate!

About the place:  
2B 1BR duplex located in Boston’s West Roxbury neighborhood. The available room has a walk-in closet plus a coat closet, and enough space to comfortably fit a queen mattress with a dresser. The unit includes an updated kitchen with a dishwasher and plenty of common space between the dining area and living room. The common space is already furnished with a couch, TV, and small kitchen table with chairs.

The nearest available transit is the commuter rail Highland stop, just under a mile away. There are nearby bus stops with routes to the Forest Hills Orange Line station. There is room for one more car to park in the driveway or available street parking in front of the unit.

The owner is an excellent and available landlord; he does a lot of repairs himself and hires out when needed. He has been flexible with the lease break situation, asking that the new tenant pay first and last months rent (no broker fee or security deposit). Rent is $1350 per person; prefer no pets, but a cat would be acceptable. Current roomate will be moving out on November 4th.

About me:  
I’m a 25yo man working a hybrid job in financial technology. I like to read, play Marvel Rivals, go to EDM shows and catch movies in theater. I recently transplanted here from Florida, so still finding my favorite spots to frequent around town. But I do like walking in the nearby Arnold Arboretum or taking the T into Boston Commons.

I work from home \~3days a week and do a good deal of cooking. LGBT-friendly, respectful roommate who values good communication and honors whatever boundaries are set. I am looking for the same energy from anybody who I share living space with, so definitely open to meeting up for coffee or a drink after work to vibe check one another!

Summary:  
Send me a DM if you’re interested in taking over a lease in West Roxbury anytime after November 4th! I can share current photos of the unit and we can arrange a meetup or video call.",1,1760018821.0,bostonhousing,0,1.0,False

This is a powerful, conscious decision to prioritize goods and services made right here in our country. When we choose Nepali-made coffee, handicrafts, textiles, or tech services over imported alternatives, that money is immediately recycled back into our system. This commitment creates a vital economic multiplier effect, directly funding local wages, supporting our small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and generating crucial tax revenue for government investment in essential infrastructure like schools and hospitals.

Our goal is to make supporting local the default choice, reducing our massive trade deficit and fostering a stable, self-reliant economy. To make this a success, we need collective, visible action. We are asking everyone to implement the ""Five-Second Check"" before any purchase: is there a quality Nepali option? If so, choose it. This simple habit, performed consistently across the nation, will provide the sustained demand necessary for local businesses to innovate, improve quality, and compete globally.

The final, crucial step is amplification: we need to spread this trend virally across all social media platforms. Take a photo or video of your favorite Nepali product and share it with your networks, challenging friends and family to do the same. This public visibility and enthusiasm will make ""Nepali First"" the dominant, proud national purchasing habit. Let's showcase the incredible talent and quality of Nepali products and turn this challenge into a powerful, irreversible economic movement!",2,1760018673.0,Nepal,1,1.0,False
1o26sr1,https://i.redd.it/nzpxtn1te3uf1.jpeg,Beyond the Five: Rediscovering the Thirty-Four Senses,"# Beyond the Five: Rediscovering the Thirty-Four Senses

*by Brent Antonson*

When I was a kid, I thought I had five senses because a chart on the classroom wall said so. Touch, taste, smell, sight, hearing. That was it — the full menu of human experience, or so we were told. The older I got, the less that felt right. Life wasn’t that simple, not even close. How could five senses explain déjà vu, or the way you feel someone staring at you from across a room?

Somewhere along the road — in Iraq, in Russia, maybe on one of those long drives through Canada when the only thing moving faster than my car was thought — I started realizing the obvious: we are *multi-sensory beings trapped in a five-sense mythology.*

Science backs it. Physiologists quietly admit there are at least thirty-four senses. Balance. Pressure. Temperature. Pain. Hunger. Thirst. Proprioception — that subtle awareness of where your body is in space. Chronoception — your sense of time passing. And even stranger ones: the sense of magnetism (yes, we have it, weakly). The sense of blood CO₂ levels. The sense of electrical charge. Each one a channel, a signal from the world that our mind translates into story.

But here’s the thing: the “other” senses aren’t just biological. They’re experiential.  
The sixth sense? That’s intuition — your brain calculating probabilities faster than you can reason.  
The seventh? Empathy — the emotional mirror neurons firing to make someone else’s pain feel like your own.  
And maybe the eighth is memory itself — because what is remembering if not a kind of sensory echo?

I started thinking about this in Sulaymaniyah, teaching late nights with power flickering on and off, my students telling me they could “feel” the outages before the lights went. It wasn’t superstition — they were sensing atmospheric and electrical shifts their conscious minds couldn’t name. The body always knows first; language arrives later.

That’s the secret: **every sense is a negotiation between perception and awareness.**  
We don’t live in the world as it is. We live in the version of it our thirty-four senses can interpret.  
Some days, that interpretation is flat and colorless — a low-resolution broadcast. Other days, when attention aligns with awe, the world opens up like a symphony, each note a new sensory register.

When I drive at night — no music, no map, just the hum of the road and the stars — I sometimes feel like I’m listening with more than ears. There’s a sensory synthesis that happens, a blending where the borders between seeing, feeling, and remembering blur. Psychologists call it *synesthesia*. I just call it *being alive enough to notice.*

Maybe that’s the thirty-fifth sense — the awareness that you have more senses than you can name.

The real tragedy of modern life isn’t sensory overload — it’s sensory amnesia.  
We’ve narrowed human experience to five crude categories, built devices that think for us, and outsourced intuition to algorithms. But beneath all that noise, the deeper instruments still play. Your skin still knows when someone means harm. Your gut still knows when a room is wrong. Your soul still hums when the right chord hits.

Thirty-four senses aren’t an expansion. They’re a *return*. A reminder that we never stopped being connected — we just forgot how much we were listening.

So next time you’re out there — walking, drifting, staring at stars, or just sipping coffee while the world wakes up — ask yourself what else you might be sensing, quietly, perfectly, right now.

Because what if heaven, or truth, or enlightenment isn’t some hidden state —  
but just the moment you start hearing *all of it* again?

# 🔹 The Classical Five

1. **Sight (Vision)** — light and color via the eyes
2. **Hearing (Audition)** — sound vibrations via the ears
3. **Smell (Olfaction)** — airborne chemical detection via the nose
4. **Taste (Gustation)** — chemical detection via the tongue
5. **Touch (Tactile sense)** — pressure, vibration, and texture via the skin

# 🔹 Body and Spatial Awareness

1. **Proprioception** — knowing where your body parts are in space
2. **Equilibrioception** — sense of balance (inner ear and vestibular system)
3. **Kinesthesia** — awareness of body movement and coordination
4. **Gravity perception** — inner ear’s detection of orientation relative to gravity
5. **Chronoception** — sense of time passing

# 🔹 Internal States (Interoception)

1. **Thermoception** — sense of heat and cold
2. **Nociception** — pain (mechanical, chemical, or thermal)
3. **Hunger** — detection of nutrient needs
4. **Thirst** — water balance regulation
5. **Air hunger** — sensing need for oxygen / excess CO₂
6. **Visceral awareness** — gut sensations, heartbeat, fullness, digestion
7. **Itch (Pruritoception)** — distinct from pain, often protective
8. **Lust (Reproductive urge)** — hormonally driven sensory feedback
9. **Bladder fullness** — detection of internal pressure

# 🔹 Chemical and Environmental

1. **Chemoreception** — detection of chemical changes internally and externally
2. **Electroreception** — weak ability to sense electrical fields (humans do have subtle sensitivity)
3. **Magnetoreception** — sense of magnetic fields for spatial orientation (recently supported by research)
4. **Baroreception** — blood pressure awareness (a hidden sense mediated by the heart and vessels)
5. **Osmoreception** — cellular water/salt balance regulation

# 🔹 Social and Emotional Senses

1. **Empathy perception** — emotional mirroring through mirror neurons
2. **Intuition** — rapid subconscious pattern recognition (predictive cognition)
3. **Temperature empathy** — “feeling” another’s discomfort via embodied simulation
4. **Aesthetic sense** — recognition of harmony, proportion, and beauty
5. **Moral sense** — emotional response to justice, fairness, or harm
6. **Humor detection** — recognizing incongruity and timing
7. **Musical sense** — pattern and rhythm perception beyond hearing (body resonance)

# 🔹 Extended and Integrative Senses

1. **Dream awareness (Oneiric sense)** — sensory realism inside non-physical states
2. **Memory sense** — re-experiencing sensations through recall
3. **Presence sense (Noetic perception)** — awareness of being watched, connected, or “in tune” with others

# 💡 Meta-Sense (The 35th, unofficial)

You’ve made it this far.
That sentence alone carries the weight of all the mornings you forced yourself out of bed before sunrise, the nights you slept with your notes beside your pillow, and the countless times you whispered, “Please, just one more page.”

I know you. I’ve seen you turn silence into strategy — the kind where every breath feels like a countdown to something that could change your life. You’ve memorized, forgotten, re-learned, and questioned everything- including yourself. You’ve prayed over coffee cups, cried over mock exams, and found comfort in the thought that maybe, just maybe, you’re still doing enough.

But I also know that this season feels heavy.Because no one really tells you that reviewing for the boards feels like carrying years of your dreams on your back- with no guarantee that the finish line will meet you kindly. You tell yourself that your worth shouldn’t depend on a score, and yet you still feel the ache of wanting to make every sacrifice worth it.

And maybe there are moments- like now - when you feel small. When the words blur on the page, when everyone else seems faster, when the questions sound foreign no matter how much you’ve read. When you wonder if all this is still meant for you.

Let me remind you of something: it is.

You are not here by accident. You have spent years turning compassion into craft, exhaustion into endurance, and fear into faith. You have watched suffering and said, “I want to help.” You have held stories that are not yours — and promised to do better, to heal, to serve. That is what this review is made of. Not just knowledge, but love.

And love, my friend, is what got you here.

When you sit in that room again next week, it won’t just be facts that fill your mind — it will be every patient you’ve met, every classmate who stayed up quizzing you, every “kaya mo yan anak” from your parents, every mentor who believed in your light, every prayer whispered into your fatigue. That’s the version of you that will answer those questions- not the tired one who doubts, but the one who has already become who you dreamed of being.

You already are the doctor you wanted to be — just waiting for the world to officially recognize it.

So when you feel the weight again, look up. Remember: stars don’t stop shining just because the sky forgets to notice them. You are that kind of light. Even in the dark, even when unseen — you are still glowing, still becoming.

And on Oct 16, you’ll sign your name with the letters you’ve always hoped for. And when you do, I hope you remember this version of yourself- the one who stayed, who fought, who refused to let go of a dream born from love.

Malapit na. Keep going.

Sincerely,Someone who believes you already made it.

(not my best self this week. I can’t seem to move on from the chaos Day 2 brought me. So I wrote this to myself and maybe u guys need it too :) )

1o26p0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spells/comments/1o26p0d/i_want_an_opinion_about_a_spell_im_crafting/,I want an opinion about a spell I’m crafting,"Hi, guys. I really like to craft spells and try them, sometimes I don’t try, but my friends do. I’ve been thinking about a spell to make someone restless until they do something, and a friend of mine has been suffering a lot for a lost love, so I was trying to make a spell that would adjust for that too.

So, my idea is to make this guy restless, anxious, miserable, feeling like crap, until he comes back to her. I admit I’m more interested in crafting the spell, but since she asked me for help, I tried to make us both happy.

The ingredients:
Coffee: Sleepless nights, restless
Cayenne pepper: Anxiety
Poppy seeds: Confusion
Licorice root: Binding, used in love spells for dominance

Rose thorns: Emotional pain

Paper:
My idea was to make this a jar, and inside would be a paper written “suffer and be miserable until you come back/ reach out”

After the person come back, you’d simply dismantle the jar. 

Obs: The guy I mentioned sucks. If he was a nice person, I wouldn’t craft this for her, but since he’s a scumbag and she still wants him back, I thought the way could be through suffering.

Question: You guys use moldy herbs to represent the opposite of their light side? Like moldy lavender and moldy chamomile for restless nights, panic, anxiety etc?

I’d love some ideas and advice, thanks!

1o26omz,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1o26omz/my_family_died_on_christmas/,My Family Died on Christmas,"My grandmother always taught me to see the good in things. I always see people for the things they’ve gone through, always see animals as people too unless I was in a dire moment of survival, always turn the other cheek, etc, etc….

Growing up I would never even think of hurting someone. I grew up shy, and timid; whenever moments called for conflict, I’d always do my best to steer away from the situation entirely. 

However, as time went on and years passed…I came to the realization that people were not to be looked at as the things they had gone through. The things people have gone through are what mold them into the people they are today. Look at Kim Jong Un; do you think that if the Kim family had been born in the United States they’d still have the same views that they have today? It’s all about the people who teach you, and the environments that you grow up in.

Unfortunately for me, the love that once flowed through the veins of my family like the very blood that binds us together very gradually became clotted with sticky dark clumps of black tar heroin. Poverty tore the family that I loved apart; and with poverty… comes a want to escape, and very quickly can that want become a need.

Unluckily for us, minds can easily be broken and discouraged. So once that want for escape became a need in my family, minds were broken beyond repair. And so what did my loved ones turn to? The hardest drugs, and the strongest alcohol they could get their hands on.

I, being the innocent, loving, little 8-year-old that I was, could only love these people so much before my mind, too, began to break. For years I watched the people that I cared the most about tear each other apart in order to get the money for their next hit, And for years my heart grew colder and colder with each passing winter of watching my family struggle on Christmas. 

Finally, on my 16th Christmas, my mind had finally snapped…

My mother had set the table in our tiny little home in a way that made my shack of a house feel like a mansion. The ham had been cooked to perfection on our run-down oven/heating system; and the sides of mashed potatoes, corn, and green bean casserole smelled absolutely delectable. The Christmas tree stood as decorated as a 5-star general in the front window of our quaint home, and from the outside looking in I’m sure we looked like a symbol of hope for a better life in our house that my mother worked so hard to make a home.

It looked…nice…And it felt nice too. Through all the hardships faced in my family, my mother had stood strong and did everything she possibly could in order to support me and my brother. Put a roof over our heads and made sure that we had a delicious dinner every Thanksgiving and Christmas. Everything was quiet and calm, and meditative, and me, my brother, and my mother felt…relaxed.

All of a sudden my drugged-out-of-his-mind father came falling through the front door, cutting the silence like a sword to a single thread of silk. He was off his rocker spewing nonsense about being invisible, and how he could feel the bugs in his brain, and blah blah blah.

We’d heard it all a thousand times before and all we wanted was to have a decent Christmas. My mother couldn’t stand it anymore so she snapped, screaming at the top of her lungs about how much of an awful man he was, how awful of a father he was, and how half-assed his apologies and love felt. 

I’d heard this conversation too, a thousand times, so I was pretty desensitized to the whole thing at this point which made what happened next all the more shocking. 

My father had silenced my mother’s screams by punching her so hard she fell into our tree and completely crushed all of the gifts underneath… I’d seen my father push my mother, or even shove my mother full force for that matter. But never had I seen him punch my mother…

I was distraught. My mother was on the ground still. She had been struck pretty hard so she was moving but she wasn’t getting up. My brother had run to his room crying in fear of my father and my father himself was still in his drug-enforced rage; trashing the living room and going on and on about, “LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO!!” and, “I HATE WHEN YOU MAKE ME DO THIS!!” 

Enough was enough.

I’d watched my mother cry too many tears, and I’d felt too much pain myself. I grabbed the knife that had been used to carve my mother’s ham, walked past her lying broken on the ground, grabbed my father by what remained of the hair on top of his head, and let the serrated teeth of the blade chew through his adam’s apple as if the steel were a junky looking for his next hit within my dad’s throat.  

My mother was too battered to notice until the once noise-filled room fell silent. She looked up at me; horrified and quivering. Blood stained the window in front of me and my father’s dripping corpse lay on the floor, still bleeding out of the wound I’d created.

The fear I saw in my mother’s eyes exceeded the fear she had when my father punched her. It exceeded the fear she had in her eyes when her own brother shot at her during a separate rampage. The fear my mother was exhibiting exceeded any fear that I had ever seen painted on her face… and I couldn’t do it. 

I ran as fast as I could out of my house. I immediately made my way into the woods because, of course, I did just kill a man. And when I heard the screeching of police sirens, I made my way deeper into those woods. The state of my mother and the house must’ve been enough to cause commotion at the station because WOW it sounded like every cop in the town was headed my way.

I mean when a full-grown man punches and knocks your mother into a crumpled mess on top of the Christmas tree…surely they’d be able to show some compassion for a kid in that circumstance, even if the following circumstance was even more horrid.

Anyway, I walked…and walked…and walked in these woods until I was certain that I was far away from home. 

Now when I say far away from home I don’t mean I made it two or three states away, no, I made it about three or four cities away at the very most. I had to cross over some main streets and populated areas in between my ducks off into the woods but I made it somewhere where it was very unlikely I would be recognized straight away by people. That being said I had to be extremely careful when it came to my decision-making and planning. 

I had to get up off the ground somehow. I was still moderately close to my home and wanted for murder so; I decided I was going to get the essentials I needed with the small 500 dollars in savings that I’d managed to muster up from my part-time work at PetSmart, then I was going to make my way further across the country. 

I bought about 15 dollars worth of ramen, 15 on Chef Boyardee, purchased a 15 pack of socks for 20 dollars, went to a Goodwill and spent 100 on shirts and bottoms, then decided to keep what I had left and use it along the way to wherever it was I was headed. I was down to 237 dollars and 56 cents.

I used 190 dollars of what remained and got myself a bus ticket that went from Atlanta to Aspen. A 42-hour trip that I was going to have to spend thinking about every decision I’d made that had led me exactly to where I was at this point in my life.  

I thought hard about life. My grandmother’s want to always do good had rubbed off on me, but the school of life had scrubbed me clean of those preachings. 

Money makes this world go round and the only thing that holds a man back from having nothing is having a family to be there for him and my family was lost about 2 days ago. On top of that, my pockets were completely empty aside from what remained of the savings that I had almost completely blown through trying to get to where I was. I had to find a way to make my money, stay as well hidden as possible, get a roof over my head, and somehow find a way to get as far away from my current identity as possible.

All of these thoughts were circulating through my mind as I rode along and made my way towards the mountains. 

Everything on the bus ride had been going pretty much perfectly; well, as perfectly as a several-state bus ride could go but—We’d stopped multiple times at rest stops for the other passengers to get snacks and relieve themselves, I myself only went when I felt it absolutely necessary. 

However, something had gone terribly wrong once we entered the Arkansas highway system. Now… I don’t know how much you know about Arkansas, but their roads are absolute garbage.

Even before things had gone downhill, my head was banging and slanging back and forth from the bumps and potholes in the road. About an hour and a half after crossing over into the land of opportunity, the bus very opportunistically bounced over a massive pothole directly in the middle of U.S. 278. The Greyhound began screeching and rumbling on its left side, followed by the rhythmic fwump, fwump, fwump of the rear left tire. 

“Fuck…” I thought to myself as we veered over to the side of the road. I knew that a bus on the side of the road breaking down was definitely going to force any passing cop to pull over alongside us; even if it was just to make sure everything was in order. I knew that the officer, or officers for that matter, would also more than likely come aboard the bus to check on the wellbeing of the passengers and I really, really could not risk any person with a badge even so much as spotting me. 

So as the bus came to a stop, before the driver could even begin to address the passengers, I faked a severe case of motion sickness and powered my way off the bus. I even began throwing up by thinking about what I’d done and about my current situation… I think I sold it pretty well but who knows.

I ended up telling the driver that I was gonna make a call and as he was announcing what the next course of action was to the rest of the passengers, I made my way further and further off the main road pretending to be talking to someone with my hand pressed to my face; hoping no one would notice my lack of phone.

Seeing as how this was an interstate highway and not just some small town back road, I didn’t have much of an option when it came to hiding myself…

I mean there was a little section of woods that I could sort of use to get out of the way of the thousands of passing cars; but past that, I was quite literally walking through people’s backyards. 

Now I have at least some sense left in me at this point, I’m being extra precautious about where I step because now I’m actively trespassing and if some sketched-out woman, home with her kids, sees me walking through their yard; then I’m one hundred percent getting the cops called on me—and then once that happens, I knew my description would match the description of the murderer of my father back home, and the police would swarm my area. 

After making it about 10 miles or so from where I departed my bus I finally found some more forest to hide in. I walked and walked again only this time I didn’t have to walk nearly as far because thanks to some miracle of God I found a town that was perfect to hide out in until I regained my bearings. It wasn’t too small to where if there was absolutely any suspicion—the whole population would know within an hour, but it also wasn’t so big that I’d have to worry about recognition. 

I cautiously made my way into the town and found a park with a pavilion. Around this point, it was getting dark out, so I figured I’d just hang out in the park until the sun went down then I’d take shelter underneath the pavilion for the night. Which is exactly what I did, I sat on the swings just contemplating everything until the light faded.

Then I made my way back to my home for the night and laid down on the bench trying to get some sleep. The next morning when I awoke it was rainy and misty. Everything was so muggy and it seriously made me not even want to try for the day and instead just hang out in solace or something. But alas, I left the park and started making my way around the town in search of work. 

I had to do something—I couldn’t just keep ducking off in the woods and hiding in parks. So the conscious decision was made to look for low-key employment. To make a long story short I found a newspaper ad for a guy who wanted help cleaning out his attic. It was just a one-time job and he was paying 100 for the day so what the hell, right?

I helped the old guy out and collected my payment which gave me enough money to pay for a hotel for the night. But guess what? That fucking hotel stay put me right back down to where I was a-fucking-gain and this time there was no newspaper ad to get me another night’s stay. 

This shit was getting ridiculous and I wasn’t about to stay in the situation I was in—I had made it this far without a hitch in the nonexistent plan so all I really needed to do was keep stepping until I eventually landed on solid ground. 

My grandmother and her teachings were dead. The me that had existed prior to all of this was dead. I wasn’t going to continue being this helpless, scared little child. I had just traveled halfway across the country, by myself. I had hidden away from law enforcement, by myself. I got justice for my mother and brother and had ended a cancer that was eating away at my family, by myself.

Oh no, I wasn’t about to give up when I had made it this far.

This world was, and still is, sick; only back then—I had no intention of being a part of the world’s cruel game anymore… 

I remembered the addiction that tortured my family. I remembered the poverty that tortured my family. I remembered seeing what lengths people would go to for the fix of their next hit, and I was going to extort every single thing that had extorted me for my entire life. 

With the 107 dollars I had left, I bought a mask, a toy gun, and some black spray paint. I painted the gun to look identical to a real gun, so much so that if the police had seen me with it that would have been the end of my journey right then and there.

I took the gun and the mask, changed into some all-black clothing from the Goodwill stash, and went out looking for someone unlucky enough to be working behind the gas station counter for the third shift.

My first stop was a BP on the outskirts of the town just right before the main road. I got exactly what I needed from the clerk. The prop gun had worked perfectly. After that, I figured that since everything had moved so smoothly and swiftly with the first robbery I might as well try my luck again with a second store.

I made my way, this time, into a convenience store also near the outskirts of town, but on the other side of the town a few blocks away. Again, everything worked perfectly. Just me in the store, no cars around, and a tired cashier who isn’t willing to risk his life over a store that isn’t his.

I made off with the money from his register BACK to the woods; only this time I was going into the woods with a little over 700 dollars in my pocket. Also this time I didn’t have to walk extraneously far. I dipped two towns over because let’s face it, who cares about a gas station getting robbed two towns over by an unnamed assailant… that could’ve been anybody….

Plus the gun and the mask had been dumped and buried under as many rocks as I could find in a stream in the middle of the woods. 

I had no reason to not be confident right now. I knew I could make something work with what money I had in my pocket. 

Dawn was rolling in around the time that I got into town though; which meant that there would be considerably more people out and about. I didn’t wanna get too careless but also, I was DONE with spending my nights in the woods.

I found another hotel, this one being 150 for the night so I paid for my room and just hid out trying to come up with a plan on what to do next. I wasn’t gonna let my mind fail me; too many massive risks had been taken for me to even be up here so I was racking my brain.

At some point while laying on the bed thinking I saw a small little dot on the wall…

It was a spider. 

Spiders have always creeped me out and I’ve always hated them but today for some reason I felt at peace with the little fella. However, I did NOT…want this thing in my room. 

I grabbed a coffee cup from the little hotel room desk along with a paper towel to put under it. I slid the spider into the cup and sealed the top with the paper towel before letting it out on the balcony.

“Today you, tomorrow me,” I whisper with a slight chuckle, before returning to bed…and getting some much-needed sleep. ",3,1760018373.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

Location: Urbiztondo Beach, San Juan, La Union, Philippines

Hello everyone, this is my first time posting here. This is about an event that happened January 20, 2024. I would like to have some more insights from people far smarter than I about this event, probably even debunk what we saw. 

For context, my girlfriend and I were on a vacation in Urbiztondo Beach, San Juan, La Union, Philippines. At around a few minutes past midnight (now Jan. 20, 2024), we had decided to walk back to our air bnb from a late night food exploration south of urbiztondo beach. It was only at most a 10min walk on the beach northwards to get to our air bnb from where we had late night snacks. 

Just as we were walking back we noticed what looked like the full moon directly over our heads, about 90° or so. We didn't pay much attention and it didn't seem weird at first but thinking back, there was no moon at the sky just minutes before. As we kept walking and nearing our air bnb, we noticed that the moon was brighter than usual. We also noticed how weird it looked. As we looked above our head, this full ""moon"" looked far closer than usual. The face of it also looked pretty odd. It looked different than the usual moon face we see. It was also pretty red at first and bright where it looked like a dim sunset was occuring (at midnight). It almost looked like it was trying to mimic to be the moon but couldn't exactly replicate its look. 

As we reached our air bnb we were perplexed to see that the ""moon"" had travelled almost beyond the horizon of the sea within just a few minutes. That's when it caught our attention and started thinking could this be a UFO. We had never experienced the moon track that fast across the sky. It also changed hues to a greenish color. This started directly over our heads and within 15mins had almost went beyond the horizon. We sat down on the beach in front of our air bnb and watched this thing go beyond the horizon within another 15mins. All in all from when we saw it to when it disappeared over the horizon of the sea, it took no longer than 30mins. 

Below are my only photos of this ""moon"". I apologize for the quality but this was the best I got at that time. I had no videos because my phone was really low on storage when it happened. I would like some insights if this was an atmospheric phenomenon or some rare cosmological event. 

I have included dates, places and time so people can check if there was indeed a full moon over our heads that night in that specific area since I have no idea how to do that. I hope i get enlightened on this. It was weird.",1,1760018368.0,UFOB,1,1.0,False

I always see people for the things they’ve gone through, always see animals as people too unless I was in a dire moment of survival, always turn the other cheek, etc, etc….

Growing up I would never even think of hurting someone. I grew up shy, and timid; whenever moments called for conflict, I’d always do my best to steer away from the situation entirely. 

However, as time went on and years passed…I came to the realization that people were not to be looked at as the things they had gone through. The things people have gone through are what mold them into the people they are today. Look at Kim Jong Un; do you think that if the Kim family had been born in the United States they’d still have the same views that they have today? It’s all about the people who teach you, and the environments that you grow up in.

Unfortunately for me, the love that once flowed through the veins of my family like the very blood that binds us together very gradually became clotted with sticky dark clumps of black tar heroin. Poverty tore the family that I loved apart; and with poverty… comes a want to escape, and very quickly can that want become a need.

Unluckily for us, minds can easily be broken and discouraged. So once that want for escape became a need in my family, minds were broken beyond repair. And so what did my loved ones turn to? The hardest drugs, and the strongest alcohol they could get their hands on.

I, being the innocent, loving, little 8-year-old that I was, could only love these people so much before my mind, too, began to break. For years I watched the people that I cared the most about tear each other apart in order to get the money for their next hit, And for years my heart grew colder and colder with each passing winter of watching my family struggle on Christmas. 

Finally, on my 16th Christmas, my mind had finally snapped…

My mother had set the table in our tiny little home in a way that made my shack of a house feel like a mansion. The ham had been cooked to perfection on our run-down oven/heating system; and the sides of mashed potatoes, corn, and green bean casserole smelled absolutely delectable. The Christmas tree stood as decorated as a 5-star general in the front window of our quaint home, and from the outside looking in I’m sure we looked like a symbol of hope for a better life in our house that my mother worked so hard to make a home.

It looked…nice…And it felt nice too. Through all the hardships faced in my family, my mother had stood strong and did everything she possibly could in order to support me and my brother. Put a roof over our heads and made sure that we had a delicious dinner every Thanksgiving and Christmas. Everything was quiet and calm, and meditative, and me, my brother, and my mother felt…relaxed.

All of a sudden my drugged-out-of-his-mind father came falling through the front door, cutting the silence like a sword to a single thread of silk. He was off his rocker spewing nonsense about being invisible, and how he could feel the bugs in his brain, and blah blah blah.

We’d heard it all a thousand times before and all we wanted was to have a decent Christmas. My mother couldn’t stand it anymore so she snapped, screaming at the top of her lungs about how much of an awful man he was, how awful of a father he was, and how half-assed his apologies and love felt. 

I’d heard this conversation too, a thousand times, so I was pretty desensitized to the whole thing at this point which made what happened next all the more shocking. 

My father had silenced my mother’s screams by punching her so hard she fell into our tree and completely crushed all of the gifts underneath… I’d seen my father push my mother, or even shove my mother full force for that matter. But never had I seen him punch my mother…

I was distraught. My mother was on the ground still. She had been struck pretty hard so she was moving but she wasn’t getting up. My brother had run to his room crying in fear of my father and my father himself was still in his drug-enforced rage; trashing the living room and going on and on about, “LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO!!” and, “I HATE WHEN YOU MAKE ME DO THIS!!” 

Enough was enough.

I’d watched my mother cry too many tears, and I’d felt too much pain myself. I grabbed the knife that had been used to carve my mother’s ham, walked past her lying broken on the ground, grabbed my father by what remained of the hair on top of his head, and let the serrated teeth of the blade chew through his adam’s apple as if the steel were a junky looking for his next hit within my dad’s throat.  

My mother was too battered to notice until the once noise-filled room fell silent. She looked up at me; horrified and quivering. Blood stained the window in front of me and my father’s dripping corpse lay on the floor, still bleeding out of the wound I’d created.

The fear I saw in my mother’s eyes exceeded the fear she had when my father punched her. It exceeded the fear she had in her eyes when her own brother shot at her during a separate rampage. The fear my mother was exhibiting exceeded any fear that I had ever seen painted on her face… and I couldn’t do it. 

I ran as fast as I could out of my house. I immediately made my way into the woods because, of course, I did just kill a man. And when I heard the screeching of police sirens, I made my way deeper into those woods. The state of my mother and the house must’ve been enough to cause commotion at the station because WOW it sounded like every cop in the town was headed my way.

I mean when a full-grown man punches and knocks your mother into a crumpled mess on top of the Christmas tree…surely they’d be able to show some compassion for a kid in that circumstance, even if the following circumstance was even more horrid.

Anyway, I walked…and walked…and walked in these woods until I was certain that I was far away from home. 

Now when I say far away from home I don’t mean I made it two or three states away, no, I made it about three or four cities away at the very most. I had to cross over some main streets and populated areas in between my ducks off into the woods but I made it somewhere where it was very unlikely I would be recognized straight away by people. That being said I had to be extremely careful when it came to my decision-making and planning. 

I had to get up off the ground somehow. I was still moderately close to my home and wanted for murder so; I decided I was going to get the essentials I needed with the small 500 dollars in savings that I’d managed to muster up from my part-time work at PetSmart, then I was going to make my way further across the country. 

I bought about 15 dollars worth of ramen, 15 on Chef Boyardee, purchased a 15 pack of socks for 20 dollars, went to a Goodwill and spent 100 on shirts and bottoms, then decided to keep what I had left and use it along the way to wherever it was I was headed. I was down to 237 dollars and 56 cents.

I used 190 dollars of what remained and got myself a bus ticket that went from Atlanta to Aspen. A 42-hour trip that I was going to have to spend thinking about every decision I’d made that had led me exactly to where I was at this point in my life.  

I thought hard about life. My grandmother’s want to always do good had rubbed off on me, but the school of life had scrubbed me clean of those preachings. 

Money makes this world go round and the only thing that holds a man back from having nothing is having a family to be there for him and my family was lost about 2 days ago. On top of that, my pockets were completely empty aside from what remained of the savings that I had almost completely blown through trying to get to where I was. I had to find a way to make my money, stay as well hidden as possible, get a roof over my head, and somehow find a way to get as far away from my current identity as possible.

All of these thoughts were circulating through my mind as I rode along and made my way towards the mountains. 

Everything on the bus ride had been going pretty much perfectly; well, as perfectly as a several-state bus ride could go but—We’d stopped multiple times at rest stops for the other passengers to get snacks and relieve themselves, I myself only went when I felt it absolutely necessary. 

However, something had gone terribly wrong once we entered the Arkansas highway system. Now… I don’t know how much you know about Arkansas, but their roads are absolute garbage.

Even before things had gone downhill, my head was banging and slanging back and forth from the bumps and potholes in the road. About an hour and a half after crossing over into the land of opportunity, the bus very opportunistically bounced over a massive pothole directly in the middle of U.S. 278. The Greyhound began screeching and rumbling on its left side, followed by the rhythmic fwump, fwump, fwump of the rear left tire. 

“Fuck…” I thought to myself as we veered over to the side of the road. I knew that a bus on the side of the road breaking down was definitely going to force any passing cop to pull over alongside us; even if it was just to make sure everything was in order. I knew that the officer, or officers for that matter, would also more than likely come aboard the bus to check on the wellbeing of the passengers and I really, really could not risk any person with a badge even so much as spotting me. 

So as the bus came to a stop, before the driver could even begin to address the passengers, I faked a severe case of motion sickness and powered my way off the bus. I even began throwing up by thinking about what I’d done and about my current situation… I think I sold it pretty well but who knows.

I ended up telling the driver that I was gonna make a call and as he was announcing what the next course of action was to the rest of the passengers, I made my way further and further off the main road pretending to be talking to someone with my hand pressed to my face; hoping no one would notice my lack of phone.

Seeing as how this was an interstate highway and not just some small town back road, I didn’t have much of an option when it came to hiding myself…

I mean there was a little section of woods that I could sort of use to get out of the way of the thousands of passing cars; but past that, I was quite literally walking through people’s backyards. 

Now I have at least some sense left in me at this point, I’m being extra precautious about where I step because now I’m actively trespassing and if some sketched-out woman, home with her kids, sees me walking through their yard; then I’m one hundred percent getting the cops called on me—and then once that happens, I knew my description would match the description of the murderer of my father back home, and the police would swarm my area. 

After making it about 10 miles or so from where I departed my bus I finally found some more forest to hide in. I walked and walked again only this time I didn’t have to walk nearly as far because thanks to some miracle of God I found a town that was perfect to hide out in until I regained my bearings. It wasn’t too small to where if there was absolutely any suspicion—the whole population would know within an hour, but it also wasn’t so big that I’d have to worry about recognition. 

I cautiously made my way into the town and found a park with a pavilion. Around this point, it was getting dark out, so I figured I’d just hang out in the park until the sun went down then I’d take shelter underneath the pavilion for the night. Which is exactly what I did, I sat on the swings just contemplating everything until the light faded.

Then I made my way back to my home for the night and laid down on the bench trying to get some sleep. The next morning when I awoke it was rainy and misty. Everything was so muggy and it seriously made me not even want to try for the day and instead just hang out in solace or something. But alas, I left the park and started making my way around the town in search of work. 

I had to do something—I couldn’t just keep ducking off in the woods and hiding in parks. So the conscious decision was made to look for low-key employment. To make a long story short I found a newspaper ad for a guy who wanted help cleaning out his attic. It was just a one-time job and he was paying 100 for the day so what the hell, right?

I helped the old guy out and collected my payment which gave me enough money to pay for a hotel for the night. But guess what? That fucking hotel stay put me right back down to where I was a-fucking-gain and this time there was no newspaper ad to get me another night’s stay. 

This shit was getting ridiculous and I wasn’t about to stay in the situation I was in—I had made it this far without a hitch in the nonexistent plan so all I really needed to do was keep stepping until I eventually landed on solid ground. 

My grandmother and her teachings were dead. The me that had existed prior to all of this was dead. I wasn’t going to continue being this helpless, scared little child. I had just traveled halfway across the country, by myself. I had hidden away from law enforcement, by myself. I got justice for my mother and brother and had ended a cancer that was eating away at my family, by myself.

Oh no, I wasn’t about to give up when I had made it this far.

This world was, and still is, sick; only back then—I had no intention of being a part of the world’s cruel game anymore… 

I remembered the addiction that tortured my family. I remembered the poverty that tortured my family. I remembered seeing what lengths people would go to for the fix of their next hit, and I was going to extort every single thing that had extorted me for my entire life. 

With the 107 dollars I had left, I bought a mask, a toy gun, and some black spray paint. I painted the gun to look identical to a real gun, so much so that if the police had seen me with it that would have been the end of my journey right then and there.

I took the gun and the mask, changed into some all-black clothing from the Goodwill stash, and went out looking for someone unlucky enough to be working behind the gas station counter for the third shift.

My first stop was a BP on the outskirts of the town just right before the main road. I got exactly what I needed from the clerk. The prop gun had worked perfectly. After that, I figured that since everything had moved so smoothly and swiftly with the first robbery I might as well try my luck again with a second store.

I made my way, this time, into a convenience store also near the outskirts of town, but on the other side of the town a few blocks away. Again, everything worked perfectly. Just me in the store, no cars around, and a tired cashier who isn’t willing to risk his life over a store that isn’t his.

I made off with the money from his register BACK to the woods; only this time I was going into the woods with a little over 700 dollars in my pocket. Also this time I didn’t have to walk extraneously far. I dipped two towns over because let’s face it, who cares about a gas station getting robbed two towns over by an unnamed assailant… that could’ve been anybody….

Plus the gun and the mask had been dumped and buried under as many rocks as I could find in a stream in the middle of the woods. 

I had no reason to not be confident right now. I knew I could make something work with what money I had in my pocket. 

Dawn was rolling in around the time that I got into town though; which meant that there would be considerably more people out and about. I didn’t wanna get too careless but also, I was DONE with spending my nights in the woods.

I found another hotel, this one being 150 for the night so I paid for my room and just hid out trying to come up with a plan on what to do next. I wasn’t gonna let my mind fail me; too many massive risks had been taken for me to even be up here so I was racking my brain.

At some point while laying on the bed thinking I saw a small little dot on the wall…

It was a spider. 

Spiders have always creeped me out and I’ve always hated them but today for some reason I felt at peace with the little fella. However, I did NOT…want this thing in my room. 

I grabbed a coffee cup from the little hotel room desk along with a paper towel to put under it. I slid the spider into the cup and sealed the top with the paper towel before letting it out on the balcony.

“Today you, tomorrow me,” I whisper with a slight chuckle, before returning to bed…and getting some much-needed sleep. ",1,1760018305.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I made my way, this time, into a convenience store also near the outskirts of town, but on the other side of the town a few blocks away. Again, everything worked perfectly. Just me in the store, no cars around, and a tired cashier who isn’t willing to risk his life over a store that isn’t his.

I made off with the money from his register BACK to the woods; only this time I was going into the woods with a little over 700 dollars in my pocket. Also this time I didn’t have to walk extraneously far. I dipped two towns over because let’s face it, who cares about a gas station getting robbed two towns over by an unnamed assailant… that could’ve been anybody….

Plus the gun and the mask had been dumped and buried under as many rocks as I could find in a stream in the middle of the woods. 

I had no reason to not be confident right now. I knew I could make something work with what money I had in my pocket. 

Dawn was rolling in around the time that I got into town though; which meant that there would be considerably more people out and about. I didn’t wanna get too careless but also, I was DONE with spending my nights in the woods.

I found another hotel, this one being 150 for the night so I paid for my room and just hid out trying to come up with a plan on what to do next. I wasn’t gonna let my mind fail me; too many massive risks had been taken for me to even be up here so I was racking my brain.

At some point while laying on the bed thinking I saw a small little dot on the wall…

It was a spider. 

Spiders have always creeped me out and I’ve always hated them but today for some reason I felt at peace with the little fella. However, I did NOT…want this thing in my room. 

I grabbed a coffee cup from the little hotel room desk along with a paper towel to put under it. I slid the spider into the cup and sealed the top with the paper towel before letting it out on the balcony.

“Today you, tomorrow me,” I whisper with a slight chuckle, before returning to bed…and getting some much-needed sleep. ",2,1760018272.0,stories,1,1.0,False

1o26mij,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommates/comments/1o26mij/will_i_get_used_to_never_being_alone_or_should_i/,"Will I get used to NEVER being alone, or should I plan to move out when the lease is up in 6 months?","

I rented my house alone for 1 year. Filled it with furniture etc, lived there with my cat. 3 bedroom house- the primary bedroom has a bathroom attached. I didn't take this bedroom when l moved in because I love to host and wanted a space for guests to stay and have privacy.
Months before I started renting this place, a friend and I had talked about finding a place together, but her lease didn't end until a year after I wanted to move.
A little while after I rented my house, however, I offered a room to her for once her lease ended. She accepted and moved into the primary bedroom and has now been living with me for 3 months.
She truly is an amazing person and I love spending time with her. But for some reason I am having an insanely difficult emotional time handling the way that some things are. I just don't feel like it's even my house anymore. And nothing is her fault!

What I'm feeling:
1.  I leave before she wakes up, and I get home after she's been home for several hours already. Many weekdays I'm gone from 6:30am-9:30pm. There have been FIVE instances since she moved in three months ago that I have been alone at the house for even a moment. This past weekend I actually got to be at the house some. She did not leave ONCE on Saturday, and left for three hours on Sunday while I was also gone. What makes it worse is that sometimes she'll make evening plans and I'll get so excited to have a moment alone, but then almost always cancels them. She did this this past Tuesday and I had to step outside to cry and hyperventilate for a moment. Please note: I am usually a pretty emotionally stable person and this hasn’t happened to me in years! So I’m not sure what’s going on. 

2. I have an indoor/outdoor cat that I NEVER get to see anymore because he is adjusted to her schedule now instead of mine since she gets home first. He used to be waiting in the driveway for me every day when I came home from work. I finally got to see him for a little this past Saturday.

3. ﻿﻿﻿She has an indoor cat that lived the beginning of its life as an outdoor cat until she adopted it, and it has so much energy. She sleeps with him in her room and he often wakes up and meows to be let out in the morning when I start moving around, so I wait to emerge until the last minute, whereas I used to LOVE getting up early and spending a couple hours reading or playing piano before leaving.

4. ﻿﻿﻿There are no ""rules"" around her having people over because I literally don't care at all-I rented the house with the intention of hosting!! Which I did ALL the time before she moved in. There are, however, ""rules"" around me having people over. Gotta make sure it's not a busy computer night for her, out of the house by 9:30 or so. I tried to have some mutual friends over on a night that she was gone and she asked me not too bc she wants to hang out with them too.

5. ﻿﻿﻿I expected this before she moved in, but the house is TAKEN OVER with her things. I have about 1/8 of the fridge space, 1/4 of the cabinet space. The tables and couches are lined with her trinkets.

Some other points: 
One day she misinterpreted my text and thought I was going to get home earlier than her from work, and for some reason her response made me seem like I didn’t even have the RIGHT to be home first hahaha 

And then the other week, I finally got to be home until noon on one Saturday. The entire week, I had been gone from 6:30a-9:30p. I woke up early on Saturday and did my chores from 7a-9:30a. At 9a, she emerged and set herself up at the table in the TV room. (We have two living spaces, this one has the TV). Around 10am I grabbed my breakfast and my coffee, ECSTATIC to put on a show and chill at my own house on my own couch for an hour or so. I stood in the doorway and asked if I could come sit and put on a show. She said ""yes but only for thirty minutes because I need to take a call"". She hadn't told me about this call. We have multiple other table spaces. The call lasted until after I had to leave the house 2 hours later. 

Like I said- I love her and I love to spend time with her, but I'm around people all day at work and now my home that I LOVED for a year- I just feel completely like a guest in it.

The thing is- since it’s more just about how NEVER being alone has affected me, I don’t think it’s fair to bring anything up to her? 
The lease renews in 6 months. Should I try to get over it and learn to be happy there, or is that impossible and I should just let her know I’d like to end the lease? ",1,1760018223.0,roommates,0,1.0,False

1o26jbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1o26jbd/find_out_if_abracadabra_dream_stain_remover/,Find Out If Abracadabra Dream Stain Remover Really Works on Tough Messes,"Abracadabra Dream Stain Remover – I didn't think I'd ever find myself waxing poetic about a stain remover, yet here I am. Honestly, a household full of kids, pets, and my own clumsy tendencies makes this product feel like it was custom-designed just for me. A handy little bottle of magic, it's marketed as being strong enough for tough stains, yet gentle enough to trust around your kids and pets. I know, lofty claims, but let’s dive into the nitty-gritty of whether it truly lives up to its ""magical"" reputation.

**Packaging and Ease of Use**  
The bottle feels lightweight, which I appreciated because I kept tossing it from room to room during my testing spree. With dimensions of 9.25 x 5.35 x 2.72 inches, it fits snugly in most shelving spaces. The spray nozzle is intuitive and not overly stiff, which is a big win when you’re juggling about five things in the middle of a cleaning frenzy. The instructions are simple: spray, let it sit for a bit, rub, and rinse. A few times, I found myself multitasking, forgetting I'd sprayed it somewhere, but hey—it still worked. It feels designed for real people with real chaos in their homes, which scores immediate points for me.

[View Abracadabra Dream Stain Remover sale info on Amazon.](https://info.senaar.com/p/b0fb8xn5zh/)

**Material Compatibility**  
From my jeans to my light-colored couch to an old carpet that’s practically a diary of my dog's adventures, this stuff tackles a variety of surfaces. Whether it was grease stains from cooking or remnants of ketchup and juice courtesy of my toddler, it handled the majority with ease. Clothing and upholstery benefited the most, though I did notice it needed a bit more muscle on older, set-in carpet stains. Still, the fact that it worked at all on stains older than my youngest child is impressive.

**Efficiency and Performance**  
Here's where it gets interesting. I’m not going to sugarcoat it—I tested this thing on everything, from fresh coffee spills (classic) to the unspeakable mysterious stains that seem to appear on my kids’ school uniforms. For fresh stains, magic is a fair descriptor. It visibly lifted coffee and wine spills almost immediately, leaving just a slight damp spot behind. Older, stubborn stains like grease and grass required a couple of rounds of application, which was a bit of a bummer, but understandable. The results were fantastic for the effort involved, and I didn’t need any obscure techniques like scrubbing in circular chants or pre-soaking overnight. 

**Strengths**  
• Versatile on different materials, including fabrics, carpet, and upholstery.  
• Effective with minimal effort on fresh stains.  
• Safe around kids and pets without any strong chemical odors.  
• Compact and easy for on-the-go accidents, like coffee spills on car upholstery.  

**Critiques**  
• Older or heavily-soaked stains may need a few rounds of spraying.  
• Not as effective on unusual or non-organic stains (looking at you, art supplies).  
• Color-fastness can be a concern on some fabrics, so pre-testing is essential.  

**Competitors**  
In a market flooded with stain removers that promise miracle results, I looked at comparable products like Folex Instant Carpet Spot Remover and the heavy-duty OxiClean MaxForce Spray. Abracadabra Dream Stain Remover shines for its ease of use, portability, and smell—or lack thereof. OxiClean felt a little more powerful on deeply embedded or larger stains but came at the cost of a slightly harsher formulation. Folex did well on carpets specifically but needed thorough rinsing, which felt tedious compared to simply wiping or washing with this one. For an everyday, family-friendly solution that doesn’t require a hazmat suit for handling, Abracadabra holds its own.

**Worth Every Penny**  
When I consider daily cleanup operations as a parent, this product feels like an investment in sanity. While products like this usually feel overpriced for the size, Abracadabra does actually last longer than you'd think, given how little you need per stain. It's not the cheapest cleaning solution out there, but for its versatility, safety, and sheer convenience, I can confidently say it’s worth the slight premium. For fellow parents or pet owners drowning in a sea of mess, this little bottle is a lifesaver.

But she’s been struggling with her finances and depression for the last while. Her electricity has been off for months and she refused help. Monday her phone service got cut off. That was the straw that broke the camel’s back and I was able to sit down and have an intervention with her. She finally (after nearly a year of me begging) conceded that she needs help and let me into her bank accounts. 

She has simply not paid any bills because she doesn’t know how to log into the portals. I had to use 7k off my line of credit to get her up to date with rent, utilities, cell phone, loans. 
Where did her money go if she doesn’t pay bills? Fast food. Over 500 fast food transactions this year…since you can’t cook or make coffee without electricity. And that doesn’t include the cash she takes out and spends with wild abandon.

I now have her set up on auto pay for everything, paid off a predatory money mart loan, got the lights and phone on, gave her a different card for spending that I load with discretionary money from her budget, picked up actual groceries, and just generally sorted out her shit. I still need to work on getting her debts to a lower interest rate but at least she can pay the minimum balances now.

This week was planned as a vacation…not what I had in mind when I took the time off. The banks are so frustrating to deal with. I’m pissed that I had to cover these costs and I am so angry that she buried her head in the sand instead of simply asking for help. I know it’s not that easy and I know I’d pay anything to have my mom functional and happy again, but it’s really hard to not feel mad about all of this after I hustled all summer to clear the last of my own debt. She’s always been horrible with money and has frittered away 90k from a work payout and back taxes. I’m so sad that she can’t take care of herself. 

Honestly I think we are going to see significant improvements to her cognitive function and general mental health…she’s been so much more like herself since yesterday now that she has power and hopefully feels a weight off from dealing with all her bill dodging. God I’m exhausted. But I really hope she will be more herself again without this stress.

I wanted to show you my latest PC build, mounted on the new Evolv X2 Limited Edition in gold. The truth is that I am delighted with the result and with the change in case and aesthetics.

My previous tower was a Cooler Master HAF 700 Evo (you can see it in the last photo). It is an impressive box, but over time it became excessively large for me. No matter how much hardware you added, it always seemed to ask for more, and even then it still looked empty.

As for the Evolv X2, it has left me with very good feelings. It is true that it does not offer many modification or extension options, but it is the price to pay for having such an elegant and minimalist design. Many of its parts are plastic, and in fact one of the pins that hold the flanges broke, but I forgive them. After all, thanks to the use of plastic (and not metal), the price does not exceed €200, which seems reasonable to me.

Regarding the temperatures, I had my doubts at first, but for now I am happy. I have added two extra 120 mm fans at the bottom, introducing air, to help the three front fans (which in practice are only two effective, since the third is covered by the power supply).

Regarding the eternal discussion of whether the rear fan should take in or take out air, I have it taking out air. My 5090 generates a lot of heat in the chip area, so I prefer that fan, located right above it, to blow hot air out of the case. If I put it the other way around, bringing in cold air, the only thing it would do is push the hot air towards the radiator, which doesn't seem ideal to me.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1o26e5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1o26e5k/annoying_coworker/,Annoying coworker,"I(F20) quit my job almost three months ago. Sara (F27) was in the same department, I wouldn't say that she’s a terrible or harmful person; however, she is extremely disagreeable &annoying. 

I mostly stayed civil with her(letting her rant to me about her exes during smoke breaks, saying good morning, generally being nice towards her but not enough for her to consider us friends), everyone else in that company disliked her. She had no friends in our team & only 2 other people in different departments, we had a bunch of work related trips & while I never went with her anywhere everytime a coworker of ours travels with her they return saying that she would pick fights with them, make them cry, get bossy, or just wouldn't cooperate to get the job done. She was frequently reported & got fired from the job for picking a fight with our team's seniors (before I quit the job myself). 

It's safe to say that she wasn't very well liked, yet I felt bad for her for not having friends, she wasn’t inheerently evil just difficult that's why I tried to be normal with her during our office hours. There're two times where it might’ve looked like we’re friends (a girl at the office invited me to go out & Sara tagged along, another time Sara texted me to warn me that someone was personating me online) but other than these two instances I genuinely thought that once she got fired she'd forget about me like any normal coworker. 

Around two weeks ago I got a text from Sara asking if I wanna go out with her, I must've seen it from the notification and forgot about it because I am personally going through a lot myself in my personal life as well as trying to manage my school work, anyways two days after she sent that text I had posted a story on my instagram and once she saw that she immediately texts me, in a defensive tone, asking why i am ignoring her and that I could just say I don't want to hang out. I admit I was a bit annoyed by this, it felt like she was stalking me and I am a generally laid back person with my own friends and we don't tend to argue about things like late texts. I reply to her saying that I have been busy recently and if I can make time for coffee I would and I apologize. After that text, I simply remove her from my story viewers as I really don't want someone up in my life deciding when I should be free for them or not and figured even if she noticed this she'd back off or unfollow me. 

A few days ago she takes a screenshot of my account asking why I removed her from my stories/highlights, why I am ghosting her, getting all defensive and ready for an argument. I was honestly shocked and didn't know what to reply to her with but she's been calling me nonstop all the time. I have nothing to say to her honestly at all and I know I should be aware that since we work in the same field I might run into her again but this behavior is really terrifying and I am not sure if I should block her on everything or if I am the asshole.",2,1760017649.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Starting in January 2026, an additional 91.74% could be added to the 15% tariff already imposed by the White House, bringing the total import tariff to nearly 107%.

The increased tariffs stem from dumping accusations that the US administration has leveled against two Italian pasta producers, specifically La Molisana and Garofalo, which have been investigated by the US Department of Commerce. But the tariffs will apply to Italian-based companies like Agritalia, Aldino, Antiche Tradizioni Di Gragnano, Barilla, Gruppo Milo, Pastificio Artigiano Cav. Giuseppe Cocco, Pastificio Chiavenna, Pastificio Liguori, Pastificio Della Forma, Pastificio Sgambaro, Pastificio Tamma, and Rummo

""We have preliminarily determined that for the period from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, the following estimated weighted average dumping margins exist: La Molisana Spa 91.74%, Pastificio Lucio Garofalo Spa 91.74%, companies not individually examined 91.74%,"" reads the document published by the Department of Commerce.

Contrary to many other tariffs from President Trump, he is not citing national security for these tariffs. His Commerce Department is simply trying to protect American pasta companies. Yet, this will increase the price of yet another staple food for most American households. The price of coffee, beef, and eggs have skyrocketed since President Trump's inauguration.

Who benefits from this pasta tariff? Will Americans switch to other brands? Even if they do, will they still be hurt by the price shock? How often do you buy pasta, and will your household be impacted by these tariffs?",32,1760017532.0,moderatepolitics,20,0.88,False
1o26cgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEColoringPagespro/comments/1o26cgs/why_adult_coloring_pages_are_so_popular_in_the/,Why Adult Coloring Pages Are So Popular in the USA (And Why Everyone’s Still Coloring!)?,"Coloring books are no longer only for children. Over the past few years, adult coloring sheets have become a national phenomenon in the United States of America. From working professionals to retirees, millions of Americans are once again discovering bliss in coloring pages full of color — and it's not just a pastime. Coloring is now a movement that is linked to stress relief, mindfulness, creativity, and emotional healing.

But why are adult coloring pages so trendy in the USA? Let's examine the psychological, scientific, and lifestyle reasons why this art craze is showing no signs of fading.

**1. The Rise of Adult Coloring Pages in America**

Ten years ago, most people associated coloring with kids' crayons and cartoon figures. All that changed around 2015, when the first wave of adult coloring books, such as Johanna Basford's Secret Garden and Enchanted Forest, flooded American bookstores. Those stunningly illustrated books sold millions of copies worldwide and ignited a movement that would soon become a wellness revolution.

Big-box retailers such as Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Walmart, and Target began stocking their shelves with thousands of adult coloring books featuring themes like mandalas, whimsical, animals, inspirational quotes, flowers, and more fantasy realms. Coloring clubs formed in coffee shops, libraries, and online communities, uniting adults in art.

What started as a modest pastime quite rapidly became America's self-care movement — and the reasons go deeper than you think.

**2. Stress Relief and Mental Health Benefits**

One of the primary reasons adult coloring pages were so well-received in the USA is that they are associated with stress relief. In today's fast-paced world, most Americans are under constant pressure from work, financial concerns, technological advancements, and more family responsibilities. Coloring always offers a rare opportunity to relax without lifting a finger. 

**How Coloring Reduces Stress**

Coloring activates the brain's amygdala, the region responsible for processing emotions. Paying attention to repetitive motion — such as coloring in repeating patterns — is meditative in quality and is used to reduce anxiety while promoting relaxation.

Adults are more concentrated away from anxiety and into the current moment as they color, creating a sense of mindfulness similar to meditation or yoga.

Scientific studies have shown that coloring mandalas or symmetrical patterns can help decrease cortisol levels (a stress hormone) and generally improve mood. Due to this fact, therapists across the United States recommend coloring as a component of stress management or anxiety therapy.

**3. The Mindfulness Movement in American Culture**

Mindfulness is the foundation of American wellness culture. From meditation apps like Headspace and Calm to yoga centers and breathing classes, mindfulness is all about focusing on the ""now."" Adult coloring is the perfect fit for this line of thinking.

When you color, your brain naturally tunes out distractions — phone rings, work information, or fretting — and focuses on the present moment. Picking colors and staying inside lines encourages mindful awareness.

Most Americans define coloring as ""effortless meditation."" It is easy, portable, and reassuringly calming. You don't need to be an artist or meditate for an hour to do it — grab your favorite set of coloring pencils and a pretty page.

**4. The Digital Detox Trend**

Americans spend 6–7 hours a day in front of screens, including smartphones, laptops, and TVs. The constant stream of notifications, continuous social media updates, and news headlines can lead to mental fatigue. Adult coloring is a healthy digital detox in an increasingly digital world.

By coloring paper, adults are filtered out and anchored in something tangible and concrete. The sensation of shading, blurring, and shaping the texture of paper provides sensory satisfaction that is impossible with computer graphics.

For most of us, it's a way to unwind after a day of scrolling and typing. It is no wonder that ""offline creativity"" is becoming one of the most highly recommended well-being practices in the USA.

**5. Nostalgia and Childhood Memories**

Nostalgia is the major driver of the success of adult coloring pages. Adult coloring pages bring back simpler times — times when life was easy and fun, school supplies were enjoyable, and imagination had no limits.

Psychologists argue that nostalgia has emotional benefits. It can:

* Reduce loneliness
* Enhance happiness
* Make social connections more effective.
* Increase optimism

When adults color, they are transported back to memories of childhood — cracking open a box of fresh crayons, coloring with friends, or presenting artwork to parents. These are comforting and happy memories, especially during times of high stress or uncertainty.

In an otherwise adult-driven world, coloring returns a child's sense of innocence and wonder.

**6. Creativity Without Pressure**

Americans require creative expression but are intimidated by ""normal"" art. Painting, drawing, or creating things can be ""too difficult"" to even begin. Adult coloring books remove that barrier. Lines already exist — you just color them in and call your own.

This low-pressure creativity allows anyone to find artistic satisfaction without fear of failure. There is no wrong or right to color — only personal preference. Whether it is blending pastels or coloring bright primary colors, each page becomes uniquely yours.

That sense of accomplishment — filling in a page and seeing your work — releases dopamine, the ""feel-good"" hormone associated with reward and pleasure.

**7. Low-Cost and Simple Hobby**

Unlike most hobbies, coloring is very low-cost and affordable for everyone. You just need:

* A coloring book or printable coloring sheets
* A few colored pencils, markers, or gel pens

You can start for under $10, and it is a perfect activity for people of all ages and incomes. With the popularity of free printable coloring sheets available on the web, Americans can find endless designs without spending a dime.

It's also transportable — you can color wherever: on the sofa, during commutes, at work, or on the highway.

In a society where hobbies usually revolve around expensive equipment, coloring is a simple, inexpensive, and inclusive form of personal expression.

**8. Social and Community Connection**

Coloring seems to be an isolative thing, yet in the US, it has become a social activity. Adult coloring clubs meet in coffeehouses, libraries, and spas across the nation. The sessions always offer a safe and welcoming space for individuals to unwind, socialize, and share their work.

Internet groups are even broader. Facebook groups, Reddit communities, and Instagram accounts dedicated to adult coloring have millions of members. Members post finished pages, exchange color palettes, and exchange tips.

This group alleviates isolation and builds solidarity — something for which many Americans long, especially in post-pandemic years. Coloring together creates an opportunity for people to connect without judgment or competition.

**9. Therapeutic Use in Wellness and Mental Health**

Coloring is increasingly being used by therapists, counselors, and life coaches as a therapeutic tool. Color is used within therapy programs in the USA as a component of sessions for patients dealing with:

* Depression
* Anxiety
* PTSD
* Grief
* Burnout

Therapists say that coloring enables clients to express their feelings in a nonverbal way. It's a relaxing and soothing activity that quiets the mind before an extensive therapy conversation.

Hospitals, nursing homes, and rehab centers even use adult coloring books to promote relaxation and improve patient wellness. There is even some clinical evidence that shows that coloring will enhance concentration and hand dexterity in older adults.

**10. Contemporary Coloring Pictures: Diversity and Aesthetics**

Contemporary adult coloring pages are light years away from the simple childhood cartoons of yesteryear. The latest designs are detailed, artistic, and endless in variety. American artists have been open to ideas that suit every taste, including:

* Mandalas Pattern & Geometric Patterns (for meditation & focus)
* Floral Gardens & Nature Related Themes (for peace & beauty)
* Animals & Fantasy Creatures (for imagination & fun)
* Inspirational Quotes (for motivation & positivity)
* Cultural and Whimsical Worlds (for storytelling through art)

This variety ensures adults can find pages to match their mood or personality. You might colour a peaceful forest one day; the next day, a dreamy dreamscape.

Many artists and small American businesses also offer downloadable PDFs of special coloring pages, making it easier than ever to obtain new designs instantly.

**11. The Role of Social Media and Influencers**

Social media has been particularly influential in spreading the adult colouring phenomenon across the USA. Thousands of artists upload time-lapse videos of themselves colouring on Instagram, Pinterest, and TikTok, accompanied by stunning before-and-after photos.

High-profile hashtags like #AdultColoring, #ColoringForAdults, and #MindfulColoring garner millions of views. Social networks allow others to discover new colouring books, supplies, and ideas — inspiring them to do the same.

They also partner with artists and influencers to publish special-edition coloring books, which combine art, mindfulness, and lifestyle culture into a single creative package.

**12. Coloring as Self-Care**

The contemporary American lifestyle is all about self-care, and coloring is the ideal practice for that philosophy. Coloring is a peaceful and pleasant activity that promotes mental well-being. Coloring requires adults to step back, slow down, and take care of themselves guilt-free.

Self-care is not necessarily about high-end spa days — it can literally be as simple as 20 minutes of coloring over a cup of tea. Many people include coloring in their end-of-day routine as a de-stress activity before bedtime.

This is part of a broader cultural shift across the USA that emphasizes mental health, balance, and emotional well-being.

**13. Enhancing Focus and Productivity**

Surprisingly, coloring is soothing — it can even increase concentration and focus, too. Many professionals who have high-stress jobs use coloring as a way to take a break at work.

The repeated, methodical aspect of coloring can reboot mental fatigue and restore focus. Some even incorporate coloring into their productivity strategy — a 10-minute session can prepare the mind before diving into complex tasks.

In open offices and corporate wellness programs, mindfulness breaks and coloring nooks are becoming more common.

**14. Best Gift and Collector Frenzy**

Adult coloring books are today a top gift item in the USA. They are inexpensive, thoughtful, and everybody's favorite. For Mother's Day, holidays, or birthdays, coloring books are the perfect gift, paired with colored pencils or markers, as a soothing and creative gift.

They are loved by adults, too. Some exhibit their finished pages in frames, journals, or scrapbooks openly. Others post digital scans on the Internet, turning personal hobbies into professional portfolios.

Coloring has turned into a hobby — a lifestyle — that celebrates creativity, calmness, and togetherness.

**15. The Pandemic Effect: Coloring for Comfort**

During the COVID-19 pandemic, adult coloring pages saw a massive resurgence across America. With lockdowns and social distancing, people always looked to comforting indoor activities. Coloring provided both distraction and emotional release during turbulent times.

The searches for ""adult coloring pages printable"" skyrocketed. Adults turned to coloring as a stress-buster amidst loneliness, anxiety, and tedium. Today, well past the pandemic, the trend continues — a testament to its long-lasting emotional power.

**16. The Neuroscience of Serenity**

Why is coloring so soothing? Neurologically, it's a combination of structure and creativity — two activities that calm the brain.

* **The repetitive motion of coloring helps to clear excess thought.**
* **Limited choices (selecting colors in lines) reduce decision fatigue.**
* **The color sensory input releases endorphins.**

Coloring engages both halves of the brain — logic (coloring in lines) and emotional release (selecting colors). This engagement brings an intense feeling of peace and fulfillment.

No wonder psychologists describe coloring as a ""flow activity,"" when time seems to disappear as the hands and mind work in harmony.  

**17. Eco-Friendly and Sustainable Creativity**

With growing awareness of sustainability in the USA, adults, for the most part, choose green hobbies. Coloring is just that. It produces minimal waste, requires minimal materials, and can be completed using recycled paper or green pencils. 

Downloads of coloring pages online also reduce shipping waste and packaging, allowing green Americans to pursue their creativity responsibly. 

**18. Endless Opportunities for Self-Improvement**

Adult coloring isn't relaxing only — it's also a personal development tool. Many Americans use coloring to set intentions, visualize goals, or express gratitude. Coloring journals, affirmation pages, and mindfulness prompts are designed to prompt reflection during the art-making process.

Others incorporate coloring into their morning routines or spiritual practices, often accompanied by journaling or meditation. Coloring becomes a symbol — a quest to bring order, harmony, and positivity into everyday life.

**19. The Role of Online Printables and Etsy Vendors**

Another driver of popularity is the surge in printable coloring pages. Sites like Etsy, Creative Fabrica, and Pinterest allow users to download instantly themed pages — from serene cottages to mythical beasts.

This convenient digital accessibility allows Americans to color anywhere and everywhere, without the delay of books. Many small creators also offer hand-drawn designs, enabling independent artists to thrive in the coloring market.

This creative economy supports the community and provides colorists with unlimited choice.

**20. A Timeless, Therapeutic Trend That's Here to Stay**

The success of adult coloring pages in the USA is a sign of a more profound cultural shift — a growing desire for mindfulness, balance, and creativity in life. Coloring unites art and therapy, play and purpose, nostalgia and modern wellness.

Coloring is more than just a pastime for millions of Americans — it's a personal ritual of joy and serenity.

With all those benefits — stress relief, focus, imagination, emotional recovery, and bonding — it's no surprise that the coloring craze continues.

**Conclusion: Coloring Is the New Meditation**

Adult coloring pages remain wildly popular across the USA because they offer something rare in a busy world — a moment of calm, creativity, and connection.

Whether you're coloring floral mandalas on your lunch break or joining an online group of fellow colorists, you're participating in a movement that celebrates mindfulness and joy.

The next time you feel overwhelmed, grab a pencil in hand and flip to a new page. Let the colors flow — and discover again how something so simple can make life harmoniously peaceful again.

If you are familiar with BT Dhak Blend that's a 5/5 dark roast for me, if you want to judge my judgment.

I haven't tried many expensive speciality beans since the price shot up, now want to try some ""good coffee"" to see, if the price I pay is worth the taste. 

I'm pretty content with my current beans, and enjoying a guilt free cup in the morning knowing that I'm not spending thousands every month.

So, please recommend some med-dark or dark roasts for me to try!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

TLDR: Here are 4 completely free programs I've made for the purpose of preparing you for a ski trip/season:

[**Novice athlete (12 weeks)**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SE-Qswe7XQYdmz1K_2oInMjkbZbwIW63sNU3cvvZEzE/edit?usp=sharing)

[**Intermediate athlete (12 weeks)**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tHOjL6_ZN0r5S-yHahwHkRcUipvD27Bl7BJkuzwl3kc/edit?usp=sharing)

[**Advanced athlete (12 weeks)**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/164DvvM2MRay5uwF0IEFcN9p9ekg7V3FklCRMUs1zyU8/edit?usp=sharing)

[**No-gym/Emergency program for any level (5-8 weeks)**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-KyPfc3bltZD1tzoXQphOh_0HtU2Exr_WlEBqSlRgAY/edit?usp=sharing)

**Please note! The above categories refer to your TRAINING history, not your skiing proficiency. So, theoretically, you could be an advanced skier doing the Novice training program.**

**Why?:** I see a lot of posts on this subreddit asking what exercises/routines people should be doing to prepare for the slopes. While some give good advice, I've found that it is very generalised and that there is little discussion around training structure, progression of volume, intensity and exercise selection, not to mention how to integrate cardio. Some programs suggested are great, but either cost a fair chunk of change or aren't specific enough to skiing. Others are okay in a pinch (e.g. leg blasters) but aren't ideal for beginners.

I wanted to make a program that was ski-specific and had different tiers for people starting at different levels of fitness.

**""SO WHAT CATEGORY DO I FALL UNDER?"":**

**Novice** = You weight train once or twice per week or have been training a little more often but for less than 9 months. Perhaps you’ve been fitter when you were younger but it's been a while since you were in the gym. Starts very slow then builds up to barbell exercises in Week 7.

**Intermediate** = You train with weights at least twice a week and have been doing so CONSISTENTLY for 9 months+. You are familiar with the bench, squat and deadlift. You train cardio at least once per week and would describe yourself as an intermediate lifter. Most regular gym-goers will fit this category.

**Advanced** = You train weights and cardio multiple times a week, and have done so CONSISTENTLY for several years. You’re highly conditioned and want to push your limits. You are coming into this in great shape. Your technique is excellent across the major lifts and are familiar with the front squat and power clean. You are familiar with plyos.

You don’t have to do the full 12-week programs, but they’re designed to be done from start to finish.

**Some background:** Programming strength and conditioning for skiers can be challenging due to the sport requiring development in multiple physiological systems; skiing taxes the ATP-PCr, glycolytic and aerobic systems each to a significant extent, requires muscular strength and endurance, muscular power, high rates of force development, joint resilience and plyometric and elasticity capacity. Furthermore, it requires balance, proprioception, reactivity and flexibility. Unfortunately, when you try to train everything all at once, your body adapts less efficiently because the signals compete with each other. Block or emphasis periodisation avoids this by focusing on only a few qualities at a time (or prioritising some while maintaining the others), which drives stronger and more specific adaptations. The changes between blocks will be most obvious when looking at the rep ranges and prescribed weight for your major compound lifts such as the squat and deadlift. Your accessory and assistance exercise rep ranges are not quite as important in comparison.

Of course, when you stop training those initial attributes, some detraining will occur. However, certain attributes will have longer 'residuals' than others. Residuals refers to the time where adaptations remain in the body. For example, aerobic fitness and muscular strength adaptations can last upwards of 30 days without significant training stimulus (or longer with occasional 'touch up' sessions'), so these are a bigger focus farther out from the start of your ski trip. Earlier focus on these attributes also makes sense in terms of building an aerobic base for later anaerobic work and muscular strength foundation before the more powerful and slightly more 'injury-risky' training done later in the program. Meanwhile, physiological qualities such as elasticity, power development and anaerobic sprint ability can fade in as little as 1-2 weeks, so these are programmed much closer to the start of your ski trip.

This block periodisation is employed mainly in the Intermediate and Advanced programs, whereas the Novice program focuses more on building training capacity and just dipping our toes into more nuanced domains such as power and plyo training. Novice program users are going to be highly sensitive to even small training stimuli from multiple physiological domains, so they can actually get away with training and improving multiple physiological qualities in a given week/month without building up a great level of fatigue.

The general structure is as follows:

**Novice:** Starts slow, builds general fitness and targets multiple attributes at once. Increase in volume (flattens out) and ski specificity as time progresses.

**Intermediate:** Block periodization (3 blocks): hypertrophy, strength, power. Lower, Upper, Lower, Upper split in hypertrophy phase (pretty standard hypertrophy training) then Full body days in strength and power blocks (with less upper body volume as time goes on). Embeds aerobic and anaerobic training throughout. Small increase in volume at the start of the program to build capacity before decreasing for the rest of the program. Intensity generally increases across the program. Deload in week 9.

**Advanced:** Block periodization (3 blocks): hypertrophy, strength, power. Embeds aerobic and anaerobic training throughout. Volume decreases while intensity increases over the program. Employs slightly higher volume and more frequent variation than the Intermediate program. Includes weightlifting movements and more advanced plyometrics during the Power phase. Every fourth week is a deload week.

**No gym/Emergency:** A gradual increase in volume, starting from square one. If you’re pretty fit, you can start from Week 3/4/5 and just treat it as an ‘emergency’ 1 month program OR extend it for as long as you need (adding volume and complexity as you go).

I've tried to be a little flexible with when you do cardio, but of course, this may still not fit your schedule. Similarly, some of the resistance training days or equipment required or even the prescribed warmup sets might not work for you either. That's okay – change exercises/adapt as you see fit! Just with regard to rest days, preferably have a day off between sessions that train the same muscle group.

I should also note that the plyometrics are programmed somewhat conservatively, as they have the highest injury risk.

Yes, these programs are lower body dominant - so is skiing. **But then why have any upper body training at all?** Two reasons: posture and falls. Regarding the latter - reaching out and absorbing impact through your arms and chest to protect your head/neck requires some degree of strength and joint resilience. An added bonus of upper body training is a well rounded physique and greater ease carrying equipment. You'll notice that the upper body volume gets reduced the further we go into the program.

Mobility? YOU know if and where you are tight. It is up to you whether you want to incorporate mobility into your training plan. If you plan to, I would suggest targeting a few key areas and stretching those areas at a high frequency (3+ days per week). These sessions shouldn't be gruelling - they should involve stretching muscle groups to the point of mild discomfort for 60-90 seconds.

**Disclaimer:** This program is for general educational purposes only. I’m not your coach or physio, and I don’t know your individual situation. Any exercise carries risk, especially if form or load aren’t managed properly. Please listen to your body, start conservatively, and consult a qualified professional before making changes to your training. By choosing to follow this, you accept responsibility for your own safety and results.

Another disclaimer: This program is not designed to peak you for a powerlifting meet. It is not designed to prep you for a bodybuilding competition. It is designed to prepare you for a ski season. If you have very specific strength or hypertrophy goals in mind, please use a different program.

12 weeks from today = 1^(st) of January - so now might be a good time to start!

**Who am I?** My name is Charles Martin. I have a bachelor's degree in Exercise Science. I am passionate about skiing and have experienced first-hand the difference physical preparedness makes when it comes to getting the most out your ski trip. This program is the culmination of my education, my research into strength and conditioning training and my research of elite skiers and their training methods.

I can’t promise the programs are perfect (there's probably a couple of errors in there - but I'm tired of looking at these spreadsheets to be honest!). Hopefully, if nothing else, these programs provide a great blueprint/structure for how you might want to prep for a ski season. Please DM me if you notice any errors or have any questions.

i've started to play more regularly online and also live (rarely) at the local casino.  
After trying to grind MTTs for a while and scoring 3rd on a 32$ Bounty   
  
(Prize Pool, $51,667.20,Me: $2,638.74 ( $2,197.04 , + $441.70 KO). As well as some smaller tournament wins totalling 7k now.

I withdrew half and lost the other half over a couple weeks worth of buyins. This is to say im barely breakeven and probably a huge fish more so than id like to think.   
Anyways I'd say im creative and intelligent enough to learn how to play Poker well.   
As of right now ive switched my focus on small stakes PLO5 and despite obvious variance and probably huge leaks still im starting to get better at ""intuitive +EV decisions"" not having studied theory yet/enough.

Ive attached a few hands, however, id also be greatful for video and book/software tips (! no live HUD/tracker stuff - i want to try and win without ""cheating"" and use it to practice after sessions)

Whilst a dream of mine, i guess it is unrealistic to expect to become good enough ,to make a living out of it, but if i can even just breakeven in 10 or 25PLO im happy!

Any comments and input are appreciated, especially on how to properly learn Omaha GTO if im willing to invest substantial time and energy.   
Thanks!

Although I am sure you would've heard of us by now I will give you a run down, we are everywhere on Reddit and are legit by far the strongest community, on other platforms such as X, Stocktwits, Instagram and TikTok we have very strong efforts too. By our social media efforts alone we have a community strength that would typically equate to a valuation in the billions, but Kendu goes a step further than that with IRL efforts.

On a side note: Kendu is only the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes for the free audit, the only other coin to manage this was Pepe!!! Here is a link to the Certik audit: [https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu](https://skynet.certik.com/projects/kendu)

Anyways back to the IRL efforts, we have over 20 community led initiatives from a street team(KenduSTREET) to a coffee business to a merch business and many others. Since these are community led so many will be waiting for higher levels to release their initiative since they will have more money to play with, the Kendu wave will only grow. IRL efforts are gonna be so important and decisive for retail investment because it shows **Proof of Humanity** that the community is actually real people with real investments. It also helps bridge crypto to the real world.

Kendu is self growing, many of these businesses like Kendu Video Games are making a treasury which will buy Kendu from a portion of the profits that they will make from the initiative, this is gonna keep Kendu's price stable and will help us push for the higher levels.

[Kendu Pickleball in India](https://preview.redd.it/7vlxjxfd93uf1.jpg?width=1703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=138412e1ec01276e93ead2160efda001cd590d9f)

Kendu is arguably the best investment rn, at 15 million market cap there is so much room for growth compared to projects already in the hundreds of millions or even the billions.

This is just the start, remember people didn't make life changing money buying SHIB at 30 billion, to access a life of luxury you will have to buy the next Shib or the next Doge or the next Pepe, at the lower levels under 100 million mc...

Just food for thought, do your research and have a think!

I bought it impulsively thinking our office coffee machine is compatible. But it’s not.

Selling for 1AED the entire box.

Yes, the entire box. 

Why you may ask? Because I bought it on sale at Noon 2.15AED. It’s now currently selling on the same platform, 39.05AED. 

Expiration date: 30.04.2026

I tried to give it to my colleagues but they don’t have coffee machines at home. I also don’t drink coffee lmao, I changed my mind. 

“But why can’t you just give it for free.”

Because why not. 😂 Seriously tho, I at least needed to be compensated even just for 1 dirham. 😂😂😂

Feel free to pick this up as I work around The Greens.

I’m happy to share pictures. And the receipt it has on Noon. ",1,1760016554.0,dubaiclassifieds,0,0.67,False
1o25xr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1o25xr5/you_have_to_believe_me_i_didnt_hurt_them/,"You have to believe me, I didn’t hurt them.","Look, we’ve all fallen into the social media trap of doom scrolling, sometimes maybe even for hours on end. We as a human species have reached a point in our timeline where every ounce of our day could be consumed by the small computer that we each conceal in our pockets. I’m no different than anyone else; I, too, have succumbed to this trap on multiple occasions, too many to even count.

But there’s something evil within these apps. I don’t know what it is or how it works. Hell, this may be a demon designated to me alone. Or an AI, who knows at this point? All I know is the other night, I was lying in bed after a long day’s work, trying to unwind and scroll some reels. Everything was normal for the first hour or so; the usual car accidents, shitposts, and memes. However, as I fell deeper into the doomscrolling, I came across a video that just showed…me..? Sitting at the dinner table with my brother and parents. The table was set beautifully, and my mother had prepared a nice meal of what seemed to be meatloaf, a meal she had never cooked before.

I was completely stunned. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, and the video went on for 10 straight minutes, just showing us as we ate quietly. Once every plate was cleaned, and we all started to get up to walk away, the video restarted back to the beginning. I rushed to my parents’ room to show them what I’d found, but by the time I got there, the feed had refreshed entirely.

I mean, how do you even explain that to someone, “hey, I just saw us eating dinner on Instagram, that’s probably something to look out for,” like what? No. Luckily, though, I had remembered the username. I typed user.44603380 into the Instagram search bar, and only one account popped up. When I clicked on it, I was baffled to find that there were no posts made at all, just a blank page. However, there was one clear sign of evidence that I was looking in the right place: the profile picture. See, this account had zero followers, zero following, and everything about the page looked grey and new. Everything except for the profile picture, which was me, yet again, staring into the camera for a photo I did not take. My face was soulless and hollow. Barely maintaining the essence of a human.

This was clear evidence, though, and I ran to show my parents again. I was profoundly disappointed when both my mom and dad insisted that it had to be one of my friends playing some kind of prank on me. I don’t know why I expected either of them to understand. I mean, they’re parents, what do they know about social media? Nevertheless, I reported the account for pretending to be someone else, and by the next morning, it had been taken down. Relieved, I went to work with warmth in my chest.

When I got home, I repeated the process. Kicked my shoes off, plopped down on the bed, and began scrolling. This time, a good quarter of what I saw was me, posted from different, all-new accounts. None of the videos were actually me; they all captured me doing things that I had never once done. Walking a dog I never had, browsing at a library I’d never seen before, all taken from obscure angles like the person behind the camera was hiding.

Thoroughly creeped out, I reported every single page I came across. It totaled up to something like 30 different accounts, all dedicated to me, and I got the notification when each one had been taken down. I decided to take a break from the reels after that, putting my phone away in a drawer and going outside for some fresh air. I actually didn’t even pick up my phone again until it was time for work the next day.

When I did, a notification was displayed across the screen. I had been informed that my Instagram account had been taken down for “pretending to be someone else.” I didn’t know what to do, so I sent an appeal to Instagram and just went to work, albeit a little on edge. When I got off, I was astounded to find that my appeal had been rejected and that it would take 30 days before I could launch a new one.

Whatever, right, but I had a real problem going on, I couldn’t just not watch as it unfolded. I set up a basic new account and started scrolling. It didn’t take long before I found myself again. Getting coffee, stopping off for gas, interacting with people I’d never met. Eventually, that’s all that my new page consisted of: just videos of me every time I scrolled. There were now too many accounts to report all with that same random string of numbers username.

As I scrolled, the videos changed. I was no longer out doing the mundane. I was now walking down the road in every video. Walking down a road that I recognized as the one just before my actual neighborhood. Then it was in my driveway, then at my doorstep, then, as if nothing happened, back to the regular Instagram feed. Puppies, nature, advertisements. All the accounts were gone. All the videos were gone. And I felt like I was going crazy.

I tossed my phone to the side and just lay in my bed, staring up at the ceiling. I drifted off into deep thought, which eventually turned into sleep. When I awoke, I went through my normal process: getting dressed, making the bed, you know the deal. When I checked my phone, I stood utterly horrified as hundreds of videos showed up, all with thousands of views, all showing the third-person perspective of me murdering my parents.

I basically exploded out of my bedroom door to find the walls coated in blood, so much so that it appeared the walls were leaking with the crimson liquid. The smell of iron radiated throughout the entire house, and when I entered my parents’ bedroom, I found them sprawled across the bed, stab wounds decorating their bare torsos. Instagram still pulled up on my device, I heard as police sirens came flooding in through the phone’s speakers.

When I raised the screen to my face, I saw myself, standing over my parents’ bed, cellphone in hand. A mixture of confusion, desperation, and terror plastered across my face. That’s when the room began to flash red and blue as police lights came pouring in through the bedroom windows. A loud pounding came from the front door before it flew open and splintered as an armed SWAT unit came rushing in, rifles trained on me. They pinned me to the floor and my phone went flying from my hand, bouncing across the floor and landing propped up against the wall.

The last thing I saw on the feed was me being handcuffed before it refreshed back to the kittens and baking recipes. I was brought in for questioning, and my lawyer insisted I plead insanity. I’m writing this from a holding cell in a notebook, and I plan to have my lawyer publish it and send it out to wherever he can.

I was reading the latest post on here about female-only spaces when he did it again, so I am riled. This is a patriarchy thing, not an individual thing, so let's dig in. 

(I am mad, but some of this is funny)

I love my husband, together 15 years, and after many many fights he has gotten better, but he touches my shit despite explicit instructions to the contrary and it's mostly trivial things, but when you walk into a room and go to pick up your keys, sunglasses, mug, towel, etc that you set down five minutes earlier, and it has vanished, you feel insane! It becomes a form of gaslighting, especially when it is constant.

Background context: our home is clean, tidy, and organized. In fact, HIS spaces are the most in need of ""tidying"". No reason for him to decide unilaterally where my things need to go.

One time, to combat this, I set up a trap, I even warned him it was a trap at the time! I set a pair of broken sunglasses and a tube of superglue on an out of the way part of the kitchen counter. I said, ""I am going to fix these in a day or two, do not touch them, do not move them, THIS IS A TRAP.""

A few days later, he's sitting at his desk fixing my sunglasses. When confronted, he said, ""Oh, I thought you said you wanted me to fix these.""

DID I? DID I SAY THAT?

So we can add not listening to the problem. He has hearing aids, btw, and yes, he now wears them regularly after a million, ""Are you wearing your hearing aids?"" conversations.

I have pointed out, the aspect that these appear to be trivial things makes it even more enraging, because I have to also justify my ire, even though he wasted my time by forcing me to:

Question my sanity
Look everywhere
Give up/Realize he probably did it
Find HIM and ask him where X is

Often I will be right there and I ""catch"" him moving my stuff, and again, in our household, the rule is, ""Ask. Communicate."" 

This morning he waltzes into the bedroom, and moves my pajamas without asking, ""so the cat can see better."" 

I am like, ""Don't touch my stuff. Don't touch it, don't touch it, don't fucking touch it.""

He came into our calm, coffee drinking, chill space, and just fucking ruined it by unilaterally deciding my stuff needed to be ""elsewhere"". Now I am mad and typing paragraphs on the internet.

It reminds me of all the times men [just feel comfortable intruding into women's spaces](https://www.npr.org/2023/10/05/1203845886/women-tech-conference-men-grace-hopper), taking our stuff, elbowing us out of the way, asking ""comments not questions"" on and on. 

I am so tired of fighting the patriarchy on both the macro and the micro scale!

1o25v9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/SparksAndFlames/comments/1o25v9x/confession_i_was_the_teacher_she_was_the_student/,"Confession] I was the teacher. She was the student. And for one impossible semester, we understood each other.","I need to get this off my chest. It’s a story I’ve never told anyone, and it lives in my head like a ghost of a life I never got to live.

I was 25. A first-year English teacher, bright-eyed, idealistic, and terrified I was a fraud pretending to be an adult. My students were seniors, 17 and 18, on the cusp of everything. The age gap was negligible in years, but a chasm in context. I was the authority figure; they were the kids.

Then there was Maya.

She wasn't just a student. She was… a person. A fully formed, whip-smart, deeply introspective person who just happened to be sitting in my third-period class. Our connection started over books. She’d linger after class to talk about the themes in The Great Gatsby or the raw honesty in Sylvia Plath’s poetry. Our discussions quickly bled beyond the curriculum. We’d talk about life, our anxieties about the future, the strange, liminal space of being in your late teens and early twenties where you’re supposed to have it all figured out but feel completely lost.

I found myself looking forward to those five-minute conversations more than anything else in my day. I’d catch myself noticing the way she’d tuck a strand of hair behind her ear, the intensity in her eyes when she was formulating a thought, the quiet maturity in her laugh. The alarm bells started ringing faintly, then became a deafening siren in my mind.

You’re her teacher. This is wrong. This is a line you do not cross.

I tried to pull back. I made my office hours shorter. I kept our talks strictly academic. But the energy was still there, a palpable, unspoken thing that hung in the air between us. And then, one afternoon, she confirmed it.

It was after school. The classroom was empty, bathed in the golden light of a setting sun. She came to return a book.

“I underlined some parts,” she said quietly, not meeting my eyes. “I thought you’d understand why.”

I took the book. My heart was a hammer against my ribs. I opened it to a random page. A passage from a novel we hadn't studied was highlighted: “I looked at him and I knew. It was like seeing color for the first time in a world of gray.”

I looked up at her. The air was so thick you could cut it.

“Maya,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. It was a warning. A plea.

“I know,” she said, her eyes finally meeting mine. They were full of the same terrifying, beautiful understanding that I felt. “I know it’s impossible. I know the rules. I feel it too, and that’s all I needed to say.”

That was the moment. The crossroads. I could have ruined two lives right then. The trust, the power dynamic, my career, her future—it would have all gone up in flames for a fleeting, secret thing.

Instead, I took the hardest, most painful stand of my life.

I closed the book and handed it back to her. My hand was steady, but my soul was shaking.

“This is a feeling,” I said, my voice firm now with the effort of restraint. “And it’s a real one. But my job, my duty to you, is to be your teacher. To make sure you walk across that stage and into a world where you can find someone you can love openly, proudly, and without any shadows. Not with me.”

She looked down, a single tear tracing a path down her cheek. She nodded, not in anger, but in a profound, heartbreaking acceptance.

“I know,” she repeated.

That was the last personal conversation we ever had. She finished the semester. She aced my class. At graduation, I shook her hand along with a hundred other students. Our eyes met for a split second—a silent, final acknowledgment of the path we didn’t take.

I heard through the grapevine she went to a great college on the other side of the country. I still teach at the same school. I’m a better teacher for it, I think. I understand the weight of the responsibility we hold.

Sometimes, late at night, I wonder what would have happened if the circumstances were different. If I’d met her working at a coffee shop two years later. But they weren’t.

We both felt the same incredible, rare thing. And the greatest act of care we could show each other was to suppress it, to let it go, and to move on, independently. It was a quiet, private heartbreak that protected a much bigger, more important picture. And in a strange way, I’ll always cherish the bittersweet beauty of that choice.",0,1760016321.0,SparksAndFlames,0,0.5,False

What you actually need is **a trash bin with a lid** in every room your baby spends time in.

Here’s why — those middle-of-the-night diaper changes don’t always happen in the nursery. Sometimes it’s the living room, sometimes the bedroom, sometimes the hallway because you were too tired to make it to the changing table. Having a small bin with a **flip lid** nearby is a game changer. You just drop it in, close the lid, and deal with the smell later when you take out the trash.

Honestly, the “diaper pail” brands are kind of a ripoff. You’re paying for marketing and fancy bags. I just grabbed a few cheap bins from Target and they work perfectly. If you really want to go next level, toss in a deodorizing pod or some baking soda at the bottom and call it a day.

I've recently posted a video on cold brew using a Puck Percolation AeroPress method that I usually use for espresso-strength brews and have discovered that this type of brew produces strangely soda/carbonated water-like brew. I haven't had much experience with cold brew, so I'd like to know if it's common to taste something like this? 

I'm also inviting you to try this method and share your experience and anecdotes!

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I recently purchased a Breville Bambino and the Breville Smart Grinder Pro to “upgrade” from my Nespresso, which is nearing the end of its life. The goal with the new machine was to reduce the coffee expenses (Nespresso pods are expensive) and take a deeper step into the world of brewing coffee/espresso. We love to make iced lattes in this house. Usually 1-2 drinks a day, double shots. I watched a lot of YouTube videos and TikToks prior to purchase, so I felt confident going in. Those might be the famous last words, as I find myself in Espresso hell. 

I don’t mind the extra steps/work required to brew an espresso shot from grounds, I actually kinda like it. However, I’ve spent about 3-4 hours trying to get a good shot of espresso brewed, and I have failed every time. I am getting a bit discouraged, and I cannot figure out where I am going wrong. I feel like it could be something to do with the grind or the tamp, but I honestly not sure. I’ve troubleshooted with A.I., but I am not having any further success.

I’ve tried two types of beans: a store-bought Starbucks brand Espresso Roast (dark roast) and some freshly roasted beans from a local coffee shop. I’ve adjusted the grind size from 5-30 on both sets of beans. It seems as if everyone is using a super low number on the grinder (<10), but when I do it seems like the espresso chokes during the extraction and I only get \~10ml of output. I have more success when I grind more coarse, but then it is really hard to fit all the beans into the portafilter. 

A.I. suggested that the Starbucks brand beans were old, and the Dark Roast was oily, which was causing the puck to choke. I bought some beans that were roasted last week (packaged for sale on Sunday, 10/5/2025). They definitely grind better, but still do not produce a viable shot.

**Machine**:  Breville Bambino

**Pre-extraction process**: 

1. measure out 18 grams of coffee beans; grind directly into portafilter
2. once the grinder is finished, use the WDT tool to break up any coffee clumps
3. tap the portafilter on the counter to level/knock coffee down for tamping
4. tamp
5. place puck screen
6. extract

At this point, I feel like I am going in circles. Any help/advice is appreciated!

EDIT: I did remove the plastic piece at the bottom of the portafilter (sits below the basket). I believe it is designed to help the Espresso flow evenly out of both holes in the basket, but I thought it could be restricting the flow. I definitely get more flow, but not where I should be.

I also only put 18 grams in the grinder at a time. I've confirmed that 18 grams in = 18 grams out by measuring the portafilter before and after filling it with grounds.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1o25lmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1o25lmi/getting_into_specialty_coffee/,Getting into specialty coffee,"I’ve worked in a bigger coffee chain (company is akin to Starbucks) for five years now. I’m currently a shift lead at my store and I am tired of my work load (won’t let me have weekends off) and the quality of drinks that I make. I work a drive thru store and my company pushes speed of service above all else, resulting in rushed messy drinks, and shortcuts in training newer staff (I’m constantly retraining them now). 

I wanted to get into specialty coffee at a small local shop but a recent interview made me feel uneasy. 

The barista position I applied for will be a big pay cut from my current job, but I’m willing to accept it for my mental health and for learning new skills. But the employer seemed uncomfortable with my experience, and he kept implying that I’m too qualified for it. As I already have multiple years of experience, leadership experience and a bachelors degree.

I spent the majority of my interview trying to convince him that I did want to job despite that, and he settled on trying to find a “trial run” day for me. So I wouldn’t leave my current job for it. I appreciate his thoughtfulness but is this a red flag for the job? Is there such thing as being “overqualified” for a barista job?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1o25k2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1o25k2l/i_spent_600_on_productivity_apps_in_one_year_and/,I spent $600 on productivity apps in one year and accomplished nothing. Then I bought a $3 notebook and everything changed.,"I was a productivity app addict. Six active subscriptions. Hours spent watching videos about ""the perfect system."" Every week I'd discover a new app that was going to be THE ONE that finally made me consistent.

It never was.

For an entire year, I accomplished less than I ever had before. But I kept telling myself I just needed to find the right tool. The one with better reminders. The one with gamification. The one that ""understood how my brain works.""

**The breaking point**

One night I couldn't sleep. I was lying in bed at 2am, obsessively reorganizing my digital task list for the third time that week. My partner looked over and said something that broke me:

""You spend more time organizing your life than actually living it.""

I tried to defend myself. But she was right. I had become so obsessed with finding the perfect productivity system that I'd forgotten to actually be productive.

That hurt more than I want to admit.

**What I did instead**

The next morning I did something that felt radical: I canceled all my subscriptions. Every single one.

Then I went to the dollar store and bought a $3 notebook.

Here's the embarrassingly simple system I started:

**Morning (5 minutes):**

* Open to fresh page
* Write today's date
* Write 3 intentions—not a million tasks, just 3 things
* Break each one into the absolute smallest first step

**Evening (2 minutes):**

* Check off what I actually did
* No judgment. Just awareness.
* Notice the patterns.

That's it. No app. No notifications. No clever productivity hacks.

I also started playing 40hz binaural beats during work blocks (just free YouTube stuff). I don't know if it's real science or placebo, but having a consistent audio cue helped my brain recognize ""this is focus time.""

**What happened next**

Week 1: Completed maybe 40% of my intentions. Felt like I was failing.

Week 2: Still around 50%. But I started noticing WHY I wasn't completing things. Too ambitious. Poor planning. Avoiding the hard stuff.

Week 3: Hit 60-70%. Something was clicking.

Week 4: Some days I completed everything. Some days I didn't. But I showed up every single day. That was the real win.

**The real transformation**

It wasn't about accomplishing more. It was about building identity.

I'd read Atomic Habits before, but I never really understood what James Clear meant by ""every action is a vote for the type of person you want to become."" Every time I opened that notebook, I was voting for the identity of ""someone who follows through.""

No app could give me that. Because the problem wasn't the technology. The problem was me avoiding the uncomfortable truth:

Discipline is built through boring, consistent action. Not through clever systems.

Three months later, I still use that same $3 notebook. It's beat up, coffee-stained, filled with crossed-out intentions and scribbled notes.

It's also the most valuable productivity tool I've ever owned.

**The lesson nobody wants to hear**

You don't need a better system. You need to build the habit of keeping small promises to yourself, even when you don't feel like it.

Especially when you don't feel like it.

Start with pen and paper. Start with 3 intentions. Start with showing up for one week without judging yourself.

The magic isn't in finding the perfect tool. The magic is in the consistency of showing up with an imperfect one.

**My question to you:**

Have you ever realized you were hiding behind ""productivity tools"" instead of doing the actual work? What made you stop searching and finally just start?",10,1760015530.0,selfimprovement,23,0.75,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\-----------------------

Hi all,

I am nearly 54yo, F, 172#.  Dr says in meno per blood work (partial hysto).

This is the highest I have ever been. Been steadily gaining for \~5 years. All the things I used to do to lose don't work anymore- little more exercise, fewer carbs/cals.  (I know, same ol story for many meno ladies).

Calories:  
TDEE calc says maintenance for 'light' exercise is 1737/day.  I can NOT even imagine eating that much!

I have been obsessively tracking food for more than a year.  
I eat 800 cals - I gain (so much for cals in/cals out!)  
I eat 1000, I gain.  
and so on for 1200, 1400, etc.

Exercise:

Not sure how to calculate exercise: I have a desk job at home, but when not working I have a farm and building (by hand) houses, additions, barns on my property.  So, I don't leave work and watch TV, but walk up and down the hill for animals, crawl under or on buildings to work on them, garden, carry lumber, materials, feed, etc.  
On weekends, I do this nearly all day.

I want to add in 'organized' exercise like weight training, but haven't yet.

Other:  
\-I started a 16/8 fasting plan a couple weeks ago and at least I seem to have stopped going up.  
\-Never drink regular soda.  Flavored water once in a while.  Milk occasionally.  1 coffee a day. Mostly water.  
\-Trying for 70g of protein and am hit or miss.  
\-Been GF for over 10 years, so rarely bread or bread type products.  I home make some GF bread sometimes (Dr berg bread or protein bread), but it's not a staple.  
\-Just had a fasting GTT test and was 99!!!! I had always been on the hypoglycemic side, <70, so this was a shocker.  High point after the sugar water was 140 (another new high for me) and dropped to 95 2 hours later.

“You know who you’re speaking with, do ya?”  

 
I didn’t. But I also didn’t trust the sound of his voice; it was too mechanical, too inhuman.   

 

“Um, well...” My phone felt heavy in my hand.   

 

“This is Lester, you idiot!”  

 

He said his last name, but I couldn’t comprehend it – the name doesn’t exist in our reality – so I smartly kept my mouth shut. I was exhausted, and needing my morning coffee. I groaned. Why did I call that number before coffee?  

 

“I run the music biz!”  

 

That caught my attention. I regarded the business card Ivan gave me the previous night; it had no name on it, only a phone number and email address, plus a creepy symbol of an eyeball floating over a treble clef.   

 

“So,” I said slowly, while lumbering toward the coffee maker, “what does this mean for me?”  

 

An uncomfortable silence ensued, long enough for me to fill the coffee maker. Finally, as I was about to repeat the question, Lester – presumably a lizard person – spoke up.  

 

“I want to record you, you idiot! Why else would I have you contact me?”  

 

More silence. After the horrific week I’d had, my tolerance for nonsense had greatly diminished. I filled my mug to the brim and had a sip. The caffeine came quickly to my aid.  

 

“Say that again,” I said, buying time. “This time, nicer.”  

 

Lester chuckled; it was a heartless laugh. Already, I was suspicious. Monsters, I’d learned the hard way, are not to be trusted.  

 

“I run the music biz,” he repeated himself. “Most of it, anyhow. But with the emergence of IA, I could lose everything. I need another hit song. Fast.”   

 

He paused.   

 

I gulped the coffee and refilled my mug.  

 

“I’m not gonna name drop,” he continued, “but let’s just say I’ve helped many pop artists over the past twenty-five years.”  

 

I didn’t believe him. But as a freelance musician, I didn’t dismiss him either. This could be my big break.  

 

“Soooo,” he slithered, “Frank...”  

 

“Hank,” I interrupted.  

 

“Right, Hank.” He hissed. “I’ll cut to the chase. The monster community feels grossly unrepresented in the music community. Unfortunately, they can’t carry a tune to save their lives. Not even autotune can help. Believe me, we’ve tried.”  

 

I ran to the washroom, and urinated. Why was I having this conversation before noon?   

 

Lester kept talking, “We like your rendition of Last Train to Deathsville...”  

 

Ugh, that song again.  

 

“I want to record you playing it live. Then I’ll have my guys fix it up. We’ll do a remix, slap on a pretty face, and voila! Hit song.”  

 

Remix? Really? I couldn't believe it. Then again, was I really shocked that the music biz was run by lizards? And what did he mean by ‘slapping on a pretty face?’  

 

“Which means...” I tried to think of something clever to say, and failed, “the song won’t be under my name?”  

 

“Don’t play dumb!” he snapped. “You’re ugly. And stupid. But you have a nice voice. And you play a mean piano. You’ll be properly compensated for your efforts, of course. But you’ll need to sign a contract, and keep your mouth shut. Except, of course, when you’re singing.”  

 

This was his attempt at humor. I wanted to stick a fork in my ears. “How much money are we talking?”  

 

He made me an offer; one I couldn’t refuse. The piano – which was destroyed by a pack of dogmen – would be replaced, he promised. (And taken off my pay, of course).   

 

He emailed me a contract, and I signed it.   

 

And that’s how I started writing songs for monsters. A decision I deeply regret.    

 

When I showed up for the gig that night, there was a keyboard waiting for me. It looked really expensive. Top of the line. I ignored the prying eyes penetrating me, and meandered towards the minuscule stage.   

 

As I passed the bar, Ivan shouted, “Hank!”   

 

I stopped. Hearing monsters speak my name is something I’ll never get used to.  

 

“The man of the hour.” Ivan was surrounded by a lounge of lizard people dressed like old fashioned pimps: purple suits, polyester, high-heeled boots and bowties. The way they licked their faces was sickening.  “Everything is all set up for you.”   

 

His eyes were gleaming, his hair extra greasy. I spotted a splattering of blood on his cheek.  

 

As I pulled away, he said, “Here. The boss wanted you to have this.”   

 

He handed me a list of songs; none of which were real, of course.   

 

I took the list, and found my way to the keyboard. At least the keys weren’t bones. I fiddled with the settings and tested the microphone. Everything, it seemed, was good to go.  

 

A throbbing spotlight found me. Already, I was sweating. I tried not to notice the headless zombies sitting in the front row. Not only did they stink, they were shoving plates of food and drink down their necks. I nearly vomited. Why were they even here? They couldn’t see me, nor could they hear the music. None of this made any sense.   

 

The lizards sitting around the bar stared at me with beady little eyes. I wondered which one was Lester. Probably the one sitting in the middle, with the checkered suit and dark sunglasses. On cue, he waved and licked his face. I gagged.  

 

There were thirteen songs on the list. Ten of which I knew from the previous night. The others I’d have to make up on the fly and hope for the best.   

 

I opened with Deathsville – the song Lester planned on recording – and nailed it. The monsters went crazy, packing the dance floor. Food and drinks were spilled. Before I started the next song, the pixie flew over and blew me a kiss on the cheek, much to the dismay of Bronzie the Brute. He came over and punched me square in the nose.   

 

My face exploded.   

 

Pain was instantaneous. I needed medical assistance. Fast. Blood was pouring out of me like spilled wine. Bronzie was standing over me, fists like anvils, ready to rumble. I closed my eyes and prepared for the worst.  

 

To my surprise, Ivan came rushing to my aid. “Get him out of here” he shouted, pointing to Bronzie.    

 

A team of security rushed over and dragged Bronzie away. The headless zombies were standing over me, poking me with their pudgy fingers. Ivan shoved them aside and threatened to have them ejected.  

 

I must’ve fainted, because I awoke in a stuffy office next to the kitchen. Ivan was patching me up. I was leaking blood by the barrelful, and in great distress. I didn’t trust the way his eyes sparkled at the site of my blood. Pain meds were offered, and I gobbled them.   

 

Tony came charging into the office. “Did you get what you needed?” he asked Lester.  

 

Lester nodded.   

 

“Excellent.” 

 

They shuffled out of the office and started bickering back and forth.  

 

I sat slumped on an uncomfortable chair. The office stank. Even with my broken nose, I could smell the rot and decay. An aging laptop sat atop a rickety wooden desk, with pencils and pens scattered across it. Next to it was a picture of Tony with his hideous children – all boys as far as I could tell – plus his picturesque wife, who looked like a robot. Brown boxes were stacked to the ceiling. Weapons were scattered haphazardly around the room: machine guns, pistols, knives, handcuffs. You name it. Plus, weapons I couldn’t comprehend, nor wanted to.    

 

Tony and Ivan were still bickering; I heard Tony ask, “What are we gonna do with him?” 

 

“We can’t kill him,” Ivan said. “We need more songs.”  

 

My heart turned to ice. I needed to escape. But how? If I could get my hands on some serious cash, I could split. Move up to Canada, perhaps. They’d never find me there; it’s too cold.   

 

By now, the pain meds were making me queasy; I tried not to faint again. Tony reentered the office. He came over, grabbed my face, and snapped my nose back into place.  I screamed; the pain was extraordinary. He slapped me across the face, and told me to shut up, then he knelt down on one knee and put his fatty face close to mine. His breath was unforgivable.  

  

“Listen here, you little shit.” His face was twisted and bent, his eyes cold and calculated. “You’re lucky we need you. Otherwise...” he cracked his knuckles.   

 

Ivan spoke next. “We have what we need,” he assured Tony. “The song is already in preproduction. It should be out next week. Two weeks, tops.” He regarded me pitifully. “First take, too.” He laughed horribly as he patted me on the back.  

 

I wanted to die. Death would be better than this. A strange aroma was coming from the kitchen. I looked over and gagged. The cooks – squid-like creatures wearing bloodstained aprons – were serving up human brains.   

 

“Get him home,” Tony ordered. He snapped his fingers. A pair of giants entered the office and dragged me towards the back door. They threw me out, then kicked me in the ribs for good measure.  

 

My face was numb, my ribs hurt like hell, and my legs were wobbly. With tremendous effort, I lifted myself to my feet and regarded the long flight of stairs leading to the deserted parking lot. There were bloodstains on the stairs. And graffiti. 

  

“I’ve got to leave town,” I muttered. “Pronto.”  As I was halfway up the stairs, the back door opened.  

 

Ivan poked out. “You forgot something,” he said. His pasty lips stretched as he spoke. He was holding an envelope stuffed with enough cash to replace my crappy Honda.  

 

I loped downstairs and snatched it.  

 

“See ya Tuesday,” he said, before slamming the door in my face.  

 

Once home, I plopped onto my bed, trembling. Everywhere, I hurt. How did I get myself in the mess? But I knew the answer. The Readhead. She was to blame. Whoever she was. I closed my eyes and succumbed to nightmares.   

 

The weekend went by in a drunken blur. I drank enough whiskey and beer to forget my problems, something I hadn’t done since college. But I was lonely. And scared. Every time I looked out my window, a black SUV drove past. Sometimes it was parked across the street. Waiting.    

 

They were watching me.    

 

Why was I surprised?   

 

By Tuesday I was sick of booze and sick of my one one-bedroom unit, and sick of being alone. Mostly, I was sick of monsters. Yes, I had more songs to sing. But this time, I was prepared. This time, I’d have my [revenge.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromStarr/)",6,1760014900.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1o25ama,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1o25ama/my_heart_leapt_into_my_throat/,My Heart Leapt Into My Throat,"I'm been watching a lot of creepy stories on YouTube - like a whole lot for several months - around a year now following us seeing some strange lights in the sky last early last November. Channels that tell allegedly true stories about alien encounters, monsters in the woods, fringe science. It's been a welcome distraction and has been enough of an interest where I've binged through many of the popular creepy story YouTube channel contents. It's been a lot of fun for me and I've enjoyed the creativity even if I don't really believe any of it - something about the allegation of truth behind the stories adds a particular flair, I think. 

Anyway, there I was this morning. 4:30 AM, up for work. I made coffee and was looking out the backdoor as the yard. Dawn was still almost two hours away. My mind was wandering to the creepy ""aliens peeking through the window"" story I fell asleep to last night as the coffee brewed. 

Once the coffee brewed, I filled my ceramic tumbler and returned to the window in the back door looking out at the deck thinking more about some of those super creepy alien stories. I was standing in the dark kitchen, wife and dogs still asleep in the bedroom down the hall. And that's when a noticed it - a noise. A faint burbling noise. I remembered the story of the man abducted in the woods who woke on a table aboard an alien ship ad grey aliens surrounded him for medical experiments making a faint burbling noise. 

A chill began spilling down my spine as I thought for sure that noise was growing louder. I began to wonder if I was actually alone. The noise was growing louder! It reminded me of the clicking popping noise the Predator made when observing Danny Glover in Predator 2. 

My mind immediately snapped to realization: the Predator is in my kitchen somewhere and he's going to get me! 

But that's when I realized the noise was entirely too close. It was right on top of me. I swallowed and spun in place half expecting to see a liazardman or a xenomorph lurking behind me! But I was alone. But that noise, that noise was still there. And when I spun my hand passed closer to my head and I began to realize that the noise was coming from my mug. 

Star Trek 2! That's it! It must be one of those brain bugs from Ceta Alpha V that Khan infected Chekhov with! It must be in my mug! Against my better judgement I pulled the lid off my ceramic tumbler and peered inside. Alas, nothing but coffee. 

Anyway, my ceramic tumbler has this rubber-like plug on the bottom and the burbling noise was coming from that. I guess it's maybe normal and I just never noticed it before. Maybe a little water gets in there or something when I wash it and the heat from the freshly brewed coffee heated the tumbler causing the noise. 

Both my wife and my dog had a good laugh about this when I told them about it when they got up. ",1,1760014848.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Inspirations (or at least stuff I like) are artists like Mamman Sani, Aphex Twin, Nils Frahm, Roedlius, Chassol, Channel Beads, and John Maus.

  
I conceived each track as a way to sketch a small scene or feeling:

* 🌅 *New Sun* — indie electronica, slow emergence
* 🐈 *A Thousand Cats* — playful loops and layered synths
* 🧺 *Lunch in the Park* — sunlit textures, gentle motion
* ☕ *Afternoon Coffee* — energic pulse and detuned warmth
* 🕊️ *Ballad for 2 Birds and a Plant* — a loose jazz dialogue
* 🍝 *Old Pasta Left in the Fridge* — krautrock drift with analog grit
* 🚬 *Another Cigarette* — hazy synth nostalgia
* 🌇 *Evening Theme* — neoclassical calm
* 🚗 *Five Hundred Miles* — experimental road hypnosis

The album moves somewhere between structure and mood, trying to make everyday details sound cinematic.

Okay, I had fun thinking this one out and writing it.

I recently read another classic rant: women saying they’re exhausted with dating apps.

When it’s about dating a broke guy, the script is always the same:

I’m tired of bad dates, unplanned meetups, unattractive girls get zero attention, that “pretty privilege” is the only currency, that they’ve been on countless bad dates where guys don’t pick them up or drop them, where the effort is nonexistent, and that men today are just… useless. Dates are just too bad, planned at unattractive/unaesthetic places.  
No point in dating brokies. Apps are trash. Where are the quality guys?

We’ve all heard this a thousand times. Nothing new. This ideology gets repeated and spread around like gospel.

**But here’s the funny part… Today I saw this one.**

Now a broke girl chasing a rich guy who doesn’t give her much attention. Suddenly the tune changes. She says:

“He’s rich, I’m just a first-gen corporate worker.”

“He asked me out to a restaurant, but I told him let’s do coffee instead. I didn’t say the real reason - it’s out of my budget.”

“I feel anxious he’ll judge me for showing up in an auto.”

And then the cherry on top: “For a month he hasn’t shown interest in hooking up.”

Let’s be honest - no girl waits for a month unless he’s a rich Chad.

**And what’s the sisterhood response?**

“Oh, if he truly loves you, he should accept you for who you are.”

***Drum roll please…***

“A good date can also be at a park with 20-rupee chai and some snacks. The company is what matters.”

Accha? Suddenly it’s about “simplicity” and “connection”? When the man is broke, it’s trash. When the woman is broke, it’s romantic minimalism.  
**Joke. Of. The. Century.**

And this double standard runs deep. I’m not even mad at the surface level - people can date however they want. But don’t shove “equality” slogans down everyone’s throat while practicing selective convenience. This is not equality. This is weaponized hypocrisy, and it gets dressed up as empowerment.

**Even Chris Williamson recently pulled up a stat from Brad Wilcox on his podcast with Mark Manson:**

“When women lose their jobs, there is no impact on divorce likelihood. But when men lose their jobs, their chance of divorce goes up by 33%.”

Translation? A man’s value still hinges almost entirely on what he can provide, while a woman’s doesn’t. Yet we keep hearing lectures about equality.

In the end, there’s no balance here - just hypocrisy. And the kicker? The same people pushing this want their men to be feminist, sensitive, and supportive… while ignoring how stacked the game is against them.",27,1760014468.0,AskIndianMen,54,0.64,False

Don't ever act as if you are being interviewed, but you are interviewing them.","Know your worth friend. Know your strengths and weaknesses, what you bring to the table, and how much your time or effort is worth, and know where you want to go. Interview them and ask them hard questions that disqualify them. Don't be afraid. Ask for the pay, if they are looking and not buying, or if they seriously need to fill in a role within a timeframe. Ask what the budget for the role is. Lead the interview. They expect you to be docile and be put in the headlights and be grilled and answered and fished out for information. Don't give them your salary expectation or previous salary, ask them what they think this role and work is worth. If they lowball or try to play around, tell them straight up you don't play games.

Sometimes they don't even look to hire but to fish information or leverage information from you to use against their own employees or skew numbers to seem like they are growing or what not.

Just know yourself and go into the interview interviewing them to see if they fit your demands. If they don't, shut down the interview the very minute you realize it. I root for you friends!

1o253pv,https://i.redd.it/zmko4i0623uf1.png,Why I Think BancNet Sucks (and Why the Government Should Abolish It),"The Philippines' banking industry stands at a crossroads, with modern digital banks offering seamless, frictionless payment experiences while traditional BancNet-member banks remain trapped in an antiquated system that frustrates consumers and stifles innovation. As someone who has witnessed firsthand the stark differences between progressive non-BancNet banks and their traditional counterparts, I believe it's time for the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) to seriously consider abolishing BancNet entirely.

# The Tale of Two Banking Systems

The contrast couldn't be more striking. If you're one of those people who has cards from MariBank, UNO Digital Bank, or Tonik Bank, you know and you've experience what modern banking should feel like. These non-BancNet institutions offer their customers a smooth-as-butter payment experience as their debit cards function exactly like credit cards when it comes to point-of-sale transactions with no PIN required for dip transactions, seamless tap-to-pay functionality at virtually any merchant terminal, and none of the security theater that has become synonymous with BancNet transactions.

Meanwhile, customers of BancNet-member banks which include virtually every major traditional bank and some of the digital bank in the Philippines from BDO and BPI to GoTyme and such, are forced to endure an unnecessarily cumbersome payment process. Want to buy your morning coffee? You tap your card and it tells you to insert it, then you insert your card, enter your PIN, and hope the transaction doesn't time out. Forget about the convenience of tap-to-pay; BancNet's stranglehold on the payment ecosystem ensures that even when your card has contactless capabilities, many merchants' terminals will force you to insert the card and enter your PIN instead.

# BancNet: A Relic from 1990

Let's be clear about what BancNet actually is: a 35-year-old payment network that launched in 1990 when the Philippines' technology landscape looked vastly different. Founded as the country's second ATM consortium, BancNet was revolutionary for its time, connecting eight banks in an era when electronic payments were in their infancy. But what was cutting-edge in 1990 has become a burden to the Philippine banking innovation.

Today, BancNet operates as the country's single ATM switch operator and has achieved near-monopolistic status, serving more than 41 million ATM cardholders across 124 member institutions with over 21,000 ATMs and 304,000 point-of-sale terminals. This position isn't just problematic, it's actively harmful to consumer experience and banking innovation.

# The Credit Card Masquerade: Why Non-BancNet Cards Work Better

Here's something most consumers don't understand: when you use a non-BancNet debit card at a point-of-sale terminal, the system often processes it as a credit card transaction. This isn't a bug, it's a feature that reveals just how superior international payment networks are compared to BancNet's old infrastructure.

""Credit card"" transactions, whether actual credit cards or debit cards processed through Visa/Mastercard networks, don't require PIN entry for most purchases. The tap-to-pay functionality works seamlessly because these international networks have invested in modern, secure payment processing technology. When you tap your MariBank or Tonik Bank card, you're accessing Mastercard's globally-tested payment infrastructure, not BancNet's decades-old system that still thinks PIN entry is the pinnacle of security.

The irony is palpable: BancNet forces customers to enter PINs for small-value transactions while international networks have proven that tap-to-pay with tokenization and encryption is actually more secure than PIN-based transactions. Every tap-to-pay transaction generates a unique, one-time code that prevents fraud, while PIN entry creates multiple opportunities for shoulder surfing and skimming attacks.

# The ATM Modernization Failure

It's especially obvious how outdated BancNet is when you use their ATMs. Modern ATMs worldwide support tap-to-access features, allowing customers to initiate transactions by simply tapping their contactless cards against the machine. This technology is faster, more hygienic, and actually more secure than inserting cards into potentially compromised card readers.

Yet BancNet-operated ATMs stubbornly refuse to implement this technology at scale. Those contactless symbols you see on ATM machines? They're essentially decorative, serving no functional purpose for most BancNet member banks. This represents not just a failure of innovation but a waste of resources with banks paying for contactless-capable ATMs but can't use their full functionality because BancNet's infrastructure doesn't support it.

The health implications alone should have pushed BancNet toward contactless ATM access, especially in a post-pandemic world where minimizing surface contact has become a public health priority. Instead, customers are forced to insert potentially contaminated cards into machines, creating unnecessary health risks.

# Why International Networks Should Rule

The solution is straightforward: **eliminate BancNet's monopolistic control and allow Mastercard, Visa, and other international payment networks to set local interchange rules directly with Philippine banks.** These networks already have the infrastructure, security protocols, and operational expertise to handle inter-bank ATM transactions more efficiently than BancNet.

Under this system, when a customer from Bank A withdraws money from Bank B's ATM, Mastercard or Visa would handle the transaction routing and impose their own fees—just as they do successfully in dozens of other countries. This approach would eliminate the need for BancNet's outdated switching infrastructure while providing banks with access to truly modern payment processing capabilities.

International networks like Mastercard and Visa have spent billions developing secure, efficient payment processing systems that support contactless payments, advanced fraud detection, and seamless cross-border transactions. Their fee structures are transparent, market-based, and subject to international competition, a huge difference to BancNet's pricing power.

# The Innovation Chokehold

BancNet's continued dominance actively bars financial innovation in the Philippines. The network's 1990s-era architecture cannot support many modern payment features that consumers in other countries take for granted. Real-time payments, advanced tokenization, seamless mobile wallet integration, and sophisticated fraud prevention systems all require infrastructure that BancNet simply doesn't possess.

Meanwhile, newer entrants like digital banks are forced to work around BancNet's limitations or avoid the network entirely. This creates a two-tiered banking system where traditional banks offer inferior customer experiences while digital banks provide world-class service, but only because they've bypassed BancNet's antiquated infrastructure.

The BSP's own National Retail Payment System (NRPS) framework acknowledges the need for modern, interoperable payment systems. Yet BancNet's continued position directly contradicts these modernization goals by maintaining artificial barriers to innovation and competition.

# Security Through Obscurity is Not Security

BancNet defenders often argue that PIN-based transactions are more secure than contactless payments. This argument reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of modern payment security. PIN entry is security through obscurity. It appears secure because it requires additional user input, but it actually creates more opportunities for fraud.

Contactless payments use dynamic tokenization, where each transaction generates a unique code that becomes useless after a single use. Even if fraudsters intercept this data, they cannot use it for unauthorized transactions. PIN-based systems, by contrast, rely on static authentication that, once compromised, can be used repeatedly.

The global payment industry has recognized contactless payments as more secure than PIN-based transactions for purchases under certain thresholds typically ranging from $200-above USD equivalent. BancNet's insistence on PIN entry for even small transactions demonstrates its disconnect from international security best practices.

# Economic Arguments for Abolition

From an economic perspective, BancNet's monopoly creates artificial costs throughout the Philippine payment system. Banks must maintain dual infrastructure—supporting both BancNet's outdated systems and modern international networks which creates unnecessary operational expenses that ultimately get passed to consumers.

Competition among payment networks would drive down costs, improve service quality, and accelerate innovation. When Mastercard and Visa compete for bank partnerships, consumers benefit from better technology, lower fees, and superior customer service. BancNet's position eliminates this competitive pressure, resulting in stagnant service quality and inflated costs.

The BSP's own regulations under the Manual of Regulations for Payment Systems (MORPS) emphasize the importance of competition and innovation in payment systems. Yet BancNet's continued usage in this modern world directly contradicts these principles by maintaining artificial barriers to competition.

# The Path Forward

The Philippines doesn't need BancNet in 2025. International payment networks have proven their ability to handle complex, multi-bank payment routing efficiently and securely. The technology exists today to replace BancNet's entire infrastructure with modern, standards-based payment processing that would benefit consumers, banks, and the broader economy.

The BSP should phase out BancNet and allow banks to choose their preferred payment processing networks based on service quality, costs, and technological capabilities. This transition would unlock immediate improvements in payment security, customer experience, and innovation while reducing systemic costs throughout the banking sector.

Filipino consumers deserve payment experiences that match international standards. They deserve tap-to-pay functionality that actually works, ATMs that support contactless access, and debit cards that don't require PIN entry for everyday purchases. These aren't luxuries, they're basic features available in most developed countries.

BancNet had its moment. In 1990, it served an important purpose by connecting disparate banking systems and enabling electronic payments. But clinging to 35-year-old technology in 2025 isn't just inefficient but it's actively harmful to Philippine banking modernization.

It's time for the BSP to acknowledge that BancNet's era has ended and embrace the competitive, innovative payment ecosystem that Filipino consumers and businesses desperately need. The technology exists, the international networks are ready, and consumers are demanding change.

The only question remaining is whether Philippine regulators will have the courage to consign BancNet to the history books where it belongs.",0,1760014337.0,DigitalbanksPh,9,0.36,False

1o24vd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestVPNServices/comments/1o24vd3/does_a_vpn_keep_you_safe_from_internet_viruses/,Does a VPN Keep You Safe from Internet Viruses?,"In today’s digital era, **cybersecurity threats** are more rampant than ever. While many users turn to **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)** to protect their online activities, one question remains common: *Does a VPN keep you safe from internet viruses?* Understanding what a VPN truly does — and doesn’t do — is essential for maintaining strong digital security.

# What Does a VPN Actually Do?

A **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** encrypts your internet connection and hides your **IP address**. This makes your online activities private and secure from hackers, ISPs, or government surveillance. When you connect to a VPN, your data travels through an encrypted tunnel between your device and the VPN server, ensuring that outsiders cannot intercept your sensitive information.

However, while a VPN enhances **privacy and data security**, it is not designed as an **antivirus** or **malware removal** tool. The encryption and IP masking functions help protect your **identity and online data**, but they do not directly block or remove harmful software from your device.

# VPNs vs. Viruses: Understanding the Difference

It’s important to distinguish between **network protection** and **device protection**:

* A **VPN** protects your **data in transit**, making it unreadable to eavesdroppers.
* An **antivirus** protects your **system and files**, scanning for and removing malicious software like **viruses, trojans, ransomware, spyware, and worms**.

This means even if you are using a VPN, you can still **download infected files**, click on **malicious links**, or fall victim to **phishing attacks**. A VPN cannot prevent malware from being installed on your computer — it only protects the **path** your data travels through.

# How a VPN Improves Your Online Safety

Although a VPN cannot eliminate viruses, it does strengthen your **overall cybersecurity posture** in several key ways:

# 1. Protects Against Hackers on Public Wi-Fi

Public Wi-Fi networks, such as those in airports or coffee shops, are often **unsecured**. Hackers can intercept your data using tools like **packet sniffers**. A VPN encrypts your data, making it unreadable even if someone tries to steal it. This protects your **login credentials**, **bank details**, and **private messages**.

# 2. Shields Your IP Address

Your IP address reveals your approximate location and online behavior. Without a VPN, websites and cybercriminals can track you easily. A VPN masks your **real IP address**, replacing it with one from another country or region, effectively hiding your **digital footprint**.

# 3. Prevents ISP Tracking

Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can monitor your browsing history and sell that data to advertisers. With a VPN, all your traffic is encrypted, ensuring that your ISP cannot see which sites you visit or what data you exchange.

# 4. Reduces Exposure to Malicious Ads

Some high-end VPNs offer built-in **ad and tracker blocking** features. This helps reduce exposure to **malvertising** — ads that contain malicious code designed to infect your device when clicked or even when merely loaded.

# When a VPN Is Not Enough

Despite these benefits, **VPNs alone cannot protect you from all cyber threats**. Malware can enter your system through **email attachments, fake downloads, or compromised websites**. Here are a few scenarios where a VPN won’t help:

* **Downloading infected software:** A VPN won’t scan or block a file containing malware.
* **Phishing scams:** VPNs can’t detect fake login pages that steal your credentials.
* **Device vulnerabilities:** Outdated operating systems or apps can still be exploited even with a VPN active.
* **Physical attacks:** If someone gains access to your device, a VPN can’t protect your stored files.

To achieve full protection, you must pair your VPN with **antivirus software**, a **firewall**, and **safe browsing habits**.

# VPNs with Built-In Malware Protection

Some modern VPN services now include **malware filtering features**. These don’t act as full antivirus solutions but can add an extra layer of defense. They work by **blocking access to malicious websites** or **warning you about suspicious domains**. Examples include:

* **NordVPN’s Threat Protection:** Scans downloads and blocks trackers and malicious sites.
* **Surfshark CleanWeb:** Prevents ads, phishing attempts, and malware domains.
* **ProtonVPN’s NetShield:** Blocks malware, ads, and trackers at the DNS level.

While these are useful, they should be seen as **complementary tools**, not replacements for a dedicated antivirus program.

# Combining VPN and Antivirus for Maximum Security

The most effective cybersecurity strategy is a **layered defense approach**. This involves using both a **VPN** and an **antivirus** simultaneously. Here’s how they work together:

|Security Tool|Primary Function|Protection Level|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**VPN**|Encrypts online traffic and hides the IP address|Protects data in transit|
|**Antivirus**|Scans and removes malicious software|Protects data at rest|
|**Firewall**|Controls incoming and outgoing traffic|Prevents unauthorized access|

Using all three tools together ensures that your **identity, data, and devices** remain secure from both **external** and **internal threats**.

# Best Practices for Staying Safe Online

Even with powerful tools like VPNs and antivirus programs, **human error** remains the biggest cybersecurity risk. Follow these best practices to keep your devices safe:

1. **Avoid clicking suspicious links** in emails or messages.
2. **Download software only from official sources**.
3. **Keep your operating system and apps updated**.
4. **Use strong, unique passwords** and enable **two-factor authentication**.
5. **Backup important data regularly**.
6. **Combine VPN with trusted antivirus protection**.

By adopting these measures, you significantly reduce the risk of **virus infections, ransomware attacks, and identity theft**.

# Final Verdict: Can a VPN Protect You from Viruses?

The short answer is **no** — a VPN alone cannot keep you safe from internet viruses. It encrypts your connection, hides your identity, and defends your data from hackers, but it does not **detect, remove, or block malware** that infiltrates your device.

However, when used alongside a **reliable antivirus**, a VPN becomes part of a **powerful cybersecurity system**. This combination ensures your **privacy, data security, and protection** from malicious software and cyberattacks.

In the end, **VPNs are privacy tools, not antivirus shields** — but in today’s interconnected world, both are essential for a truly secure online experience.",1,1760013724.0,BestVPNServices,0,1.0,False

1o24v8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1o24v8p/unsure_if_i_should_shoot_my_shot/,Unsure if I should shoot my shot.,"I (33 m) and a classmate  (25 f) are in a two year degree community college program. Currently are class size is in the teens with women outnumbering men. Class is three days a week. Two days are morning to mid-afternoon, and the other is just a lecture in the morning. But we're able to stay after class or come in on off days to use the lab for practice. The program is medical, so everyone is required to physically interact with each other. My classmates and I do more than just sit around staring at a PowerPoint.

I'm introverted, and I think she is too, based on how quiet she is compared to the other girls in our class and that she almost always wears darker colors. A lot of the other girls dress in bright colors. More on that later. We do talk to our classmates and each other, of course. She's just not as talkative and doesn't engage in larger group conversations as much. I do sometimes, but that's because I'm trying to be more outgoing. Early in the semester, I would go out into the hallway and sit at one of the tables to eat and read when on lunchbreak. Now I try to hang around my classmates and maybe contribute here and there in conversations.

The last time I was interested in a girl was Spring semester 2020. We were in a biology class together and worked in the same lab group. We would chat during lab and went to the same gym. When I saw her there, I would smile and wave and she would do the same back. However, I was anxious about asking her out during the semester because I didn't want things to become awkward if she declined. So, I intended to give her my number towards the end.

But then Covid hit and classes were moved to virtual learning, and everyone had to quarantine. With that came an end to seeing her in person. I wasn't confident enough to try contacting her through student email, and eventually, the semester ended without anything happening.

So back to the present. I'm not sure how to tell if there might be some interest from her or not.

Positive signs, I think.

1. One day after class, she, another girl, and I stayed after to practice material. We were sitting around taking a break chatting about random stuff, and she asked how old I was. I said, ""Let me do some math real quick, 33"" and she kinda quickly said she's 25. Then she said I don't look 33. I do look younger than I am. A 22 year old guy in a class I had a few years ago thought we were the same age. Other girls said she was 18, and we kinda jokingly said she was a baby.

2. She laughs at my dumb jokes and will turn towards me when she does. For example, I was scrubbing green marker off my leg and said, ""I look like I dropkicked The Grinch"" when she happened to be walking by and she stopped to laugh. This has happened multiple times. I like to think I have a decent sense of humor despite being the quiet guy, but she seems to consistently laugh and smile when I say something funny even if it's simple. Like, we and another couple of classmates were talking about the online quizzes we take, and I told them I'll look at my dog and ask if she knows the answer. That also got a laugh out of her.

3. I do catch her looking at me sometimes when we're in the middle of practicing things in class. She doesn't always glance away immediately. Sometimes, we'll kinda smile at one another before one of us looks away. But I'm not sure if she's spacing out thinking about something and our eyes happened to meet or if she was looking at what I was doing.

4. She also has asked me to help her and her friend practice some material for skills tests we have. Like proper positioning of a tool we use. I know that's vague, but I don't want to give too much detail on what our program is, if that's ok.

5. On Tuesdays, we just have lectures, so everyone tends to wear something other than gym clothes like we do for lab. This is where the colors she normally wears comes into play. I'm always one of the first to arrive to class, so I tend to notice others as they arrive. This past Tuesday, she came in wearing a pink long sleeve sweatshirt or sweater. About halfway through class our instructor told us to take a break. Most of us left the classroom to stretch our legs, use the restroom, or grab a snack.

On my way back to the classroom, I was talking to another girl in our class walking beside me about upcoming exams when I noticed (haven't given girl I'm interested in a name yet. Let's go with B.) B walking behind us. I turned around and said, ""That might be the brightest color I've seen you wear."" She kinda laughed and I followed up with, ""It looks good on you."" Then she smiled as I turned back around as we were nearing the classroom.

6. Last thing. We use a Teams chat to ask questions, set up times to meet to study, etc. We had a paper due last week and around 8 pm last Wednesday a lot of us were active in Teams discussing it. One girl, N, was having issues formatting hers, so I was messaging her in the chat. I'd already kinda established myself as the computer guy because I helped connect the large monitor our instructor uses in class for PowerPoint slides and helped another classmate connect to the school's wifi.

So, I sent my suggestion in the chat on what to try to N, she said thanks. I said, ""I should start charging you guys for IT support."" Then B, who was online but hadn't engaged in the chat yet that night, sent ""(My name) you're a genius."" I just used a thumbs up emoji to reply to that because I was honestly caught off guard and more people started messaging the chat about other things.

So those are positive things I've noticed about our interactions. There are two negatives that make me hesitant to ask her out.

The first is the possibility of things being awkward if she declines. As I said earlier, we're all in a two year program together. Meaning, all of us will be seeing each other as much as or even more than our own families or other friend groups. I'm concerned that the rapport I've built with everyone could be damaged if B rejected me. If she did, I would be disappointed, of course, but I'm not one of those assholes that would bad mouth her. She gives off a nice vibe, so I doubt she would do something like say to the other girls, ""(My name) asked me out. Can you believe that? How dare he?""

The other negative is something that happened last Saturday. As participants in the program we have to engage in some volunteering. The college hosted an event last Saturday that required us to be there to help out. No big deal. It was actually a lot of fun.

The Thursday prior to the event, I messaged the Teams chat asking if anyone wanted to meet up at the lab on Friday to practice and study. Girl F said she had to work Friday, but she'd be up for staying after the event was over. I and another guy in our class responded within a couple of minutes later that would work. Then, about 40 minutes later B replied that would work for her too. She had to have seen that I said I would be staying after because no one else messaged the chat in that 40-minute time frame.

So, day of event, all of us do our volunteer thing, I interacted with B and one of the other girls she's friends with because they're in another class together. She's the same one who was with B and me when we were studying and B asked me how old I was. There was a point where I picked up a marker and asked for B's hand. She held it up for me with no hesitation and I drew an X on it, commented that I realized that marker had glitter in it, and asked her to please not smear it on me. That got a laugh out of her and her friend.

Little while later, our whole group was standing together as the event was wrapping up. B was in front of me, so I tapped her on the shoulder (she didn't jump our of her skin, thankfully) and asked her if she still wanted to stay after to study and grab food from the cafeteria. She said yeah, and that she would have to grab her stuff from her car first. Girl F brought her kid to the event, so she told everyone she was going to leave instead of studying.

Here's where I wonder if I messed up or if there was a misunderstanding. B, F, her kid, another girl in our class who rode with F, and I were talking as F and co walked to her truck. She said she had to leave because her kid was getting sleepy. Meaning the only people staying to study would be B, me, and other guy in our class who's kinda awkward. B broke off from the group to go to her car while I went towards the building our lab is in to drop off my water bottle and use the restroom. F and co left. Other guy went to the cafeteria.

I was heading towards our lab building when I noticed our instructor came up to B at her car and was talking to her. Idk what was said because I wasn't close enough to hear and continued into the building. I used the restroom, exited the building, and saw that her car was gone when I came back out. She left without saying anything and didn't message the group chat either.

I met up with other guy at the cafeteria and we still studied, so not a total waste.

So, idk if she was feeling uncomfortable about staying to study with me and other guy, or if something personal came up, or if our instructor told her the campus would close soon. I don't think it's normally opened Saturdays with hours as long as weekdays, but no one came and kicked me and other guy out after about 45 minutes of studying.

That was last Saturday. Monday through Wednesday she's acted like she normally does. I thought about asking her if something came up or if she felt uncomfortable, but the one time we were alone was yesterday morning when we were the first to arrive in the hallway before class starts. I decided not to bring it up because I didn't want to make things awkward. I was the first to arrive and when she came to our group's waiting area and I gave her a smile and little wave and she smiled back before sitting in the chair next to mine. Then I went back to reading my book and she pulled out her phone.

As for how I would ask her out, I planned on just giving her my number and saying something like, ""If you ever wanna grab coffee and talk about something other than school, feel free to text me.""
Then on this past Tuesday, F passed around a notebook for us to write our phone numbers in to start a group chat. I guess we're using that instead of Teams now for some things. Meaning I have B's number, but I'm not going to text her unless I get permission from her in person or if she texts me first.

Honestly, part of me is thinking don't ask her out and just let things be. Other part is thinking maybe there's something there and I have to be the one to initiate because we're both quiet people, even though I've definitely broken out of my shell these past few as I've become more comfortable around everyone. I still stutter or lose my voice here and there, but I've improved.

Yesterday, some of us stayed after to help another girl (C) who had missed some days catch up on material. B, F, girl who rides with F (call her E), and I helped review with her. When B and C were leaving, I asked if they would want to meet up again this week. They and B's friend from earlier are all in a prerequisite class together. They said they'd come to the lab tomorrow on Friday after that class was over. I basically said I'd join them if that's ok. C gave me the ok and I think B nodded along too.

I'm a little concerned I might be coming off as creepy by trying to be around B. I mean well. I do want to study and be more outgoing. When other classmates discuss meeting up I offer to join in. I never got the vibe she feels uncomfortable. Thing is, the only people who have consistently made attempts to stay after class is over or meet up to study are B, B's friend from earlier in the post (the one who's 18 and also in the pre-req class), E, F, me, and N, the girl who I helped with her paper issue.

I should probably also mention I don't have social media like Instagram. And as far as I can tell, B is probably single. I've never overheard her talking about a boyfriend like the other girls in our class do. If she did bring up a boyfriend at all then I wouldn't have typed all this out.

There has been some talk here and there about everyone getting together for a Halloween party, but nothing definitive yet. I'm kinda hoping someone hosts one and we're all able to meet up and have a fun time.

Hells, this is a lot. To anyone who even attempts to read this, thank you.

TL;DR

I'm interested in a girl in my class. I'm 33, she's 25. I think she might be interested as well, but not completely confident she is because I could be misinterpreting her signs. Men are dense creatures and I have a tendency to overthink things.
She laughs at my dumb jokes, but she may just be acting nice. Or maybe she's just introverted and I need to be the one to reach out.

I think to myself that if I don't ask the question, then the answer will always be ""No."" But if I do, there's a possibility of receiving a ""Yes.""

Is the age gap a problem? I also live at home with my parents still and am living off of the savings I earned these past years while I was struggling with what to choose as a career. That's probably a turn-off for some women who already have their careers established in their 20-30s.

1o24u0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldbrew/comments/1o24u0v/question_calculating_accurate_concentrate_ratios/,Question calculating accurate concentrate ratios,"Sorry I'd advance for the long intro. I have made cold brew at home on and off for the past couple years, going back and forth between regular drip, espresso and cold brew depending on how much patience I have. I have progressively gotten more exact in how I am making cold brew, particularly with the ratios and I have 3 different size containers that I make cold brew in.

Having now gotten to comfortable ratio levels, and the price of coffee getting higher and higher and  wanting to get as much out of each brew, I've gotten to a question around concentrate produced from the process, water lost in the process and water displacement.

I have a 40oz mason jar thats one of the smaller sizes I use and my ratios used to full capacity of the container. The last batch I made felt like it didn't make as much as I expected so I decided to try and calculate 2 things; Initial water displacement from the coffee, and water absorption at the end.

I was looking to do 1:5 for the 40oz with ~210g ground coffee (~2 1/4 cups). I always use steep bags for the grounds with about 1/2 cup per bag across 4 bags. What I found was that after including the bags I lost 12oz (1.5 cups) of water to displacement with only 28oz (3.5 cups) in the container.

After brewing I also found that across the 4 bags, including a light squeeze after removing them, I lost another 4oz (1/2 cup) of liquid to absorption because I ended up with 24oz (3 cups) of concentrate at the end.

Sorry for the long winded path to my questions but basically it is about what liquid volume I should be using in my ratio calculation. It now feels obvious the full container volume doesn't make sense of 40oz. But should I do my ratio off the net water after displacement (28oz)  or do I also need to account for the water lost to absorption into the grinds (28oz - 4oz)?

Also, is there a standard water absorption expected by weight of coffee that I can use when I go to my larger volume containers?",2,1760013624.0,coldbrew,2,1.0,False

* **Predictive maintenance**: It alerts you before things go wrong, no more guessing when to descale.
* **Energy efficiency**: Smart without wasting power.

I am a a SAHD to a lovely 9 month old son and have been doing so full time since he  was about 2 months old. 

However I am slowly losing my mind. We are a one car household without the ability to get another and live in a small southern town which has a gas station and civil war museum, 5 churches and.... That's it. Everything else requires a car to even hope to get to. 

I have almost the exact same routine every day. And from around 6am to 6pm I am a full time parent (as well my wife travels for work often so it's sometimes a 24h thing for a few days at a time and runs a side business on the weekends that keeps us afloat) as well as doing all of the house work, cooking, laundry, cleaning, taking care of the bathrooms and doing little projects my wife thinks of and constantly falling behind on outside work as I can't just mow the lawn for an hour while he is inside. 

When I do take him out on runs and walks (which is one of the few activities we can do) I get nothing but dirty looks from the locals but idc about that. 

So most of our time is spent attempting to learn and play inside and with winter coming I am certain I'm just gonna be trapped inside all day every day waiting on my wife to get home to help me put him to bed.

My mother comes by once a month to watch him for a day for me to sprint to get all the outside work done.

I often feel just trapped, burnout, and sad but do my best to put on an air of positivity, growth, and curiosity when I'm around my son. 

Plus at the end of the day once he finally goes down to sleep it's time to start thinking about the next day so I clean for another few hours to make sure we can save money by sending my wife with a lunch and coffee and that all our clothes are clean and folded nicel.


Then at like 9 or 10pm I either get to choose between doing a small amount of freelance work, seeing my wife for one or two hours a day of just chatting next to each other in bed or passing out to.stsrt it all over again(baring a night time wake up which my wife handles)


I can also tell she is incredibly burnt out but is doing such an amazing job caring for us financially and providing real stability for us that I can't help but work my ass off every day in support of her and our child. 


I'm finding myself dreaming of another life often. Not in any serious fashion but looking at my friends and seeing them travel, just go out at night, or buy things they enjoy and am so envious in small moments and times before I come to my senses and try and recognize the joy I have each day and in each moment with my family and son. 


Yet there is a creeping cold. I find that I am using the TV more and putting on reading rainbow, bluey, or Japanese slow TV just to get 20min to close my eyes on the couch while he plays around me. 


Any advice? I'm not in a bad mental place I'm just noticing cracks beginning to form...

Not sure what her motive would be, but it would also explain her always being at the mayors side (she gets intel on the mayors theories).

I bought an ECP34.21 machine for cheap.

The seller mentioned that he used the machine for about 4 years, making 1 or 2 coffees per day.

So I decided to dismantle the whole machine to clean it properly.. Which I did and noticed that the boiler has some issues.

The lower part of the boiler has a brass tube, i think is brass, through which water is going to the portafilter. The issue is that I am spinning this tube when I screw the shower screen. Since it is moving, it is leaking slightly.

Using a little force, I managed to remove this tube using a little force, hoping that it was screwed in place, but unfortunately I see that it was pressure fitted

Now, do you have any ideas how I can fix this?",1,1760012809.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Or just in a lonely season,"Am I the problem because after finally stepping out of codependent patterns and clearing out mismatched friendships, I’m still alone, despite years of trying to meet healthy people?

For most of my life I struggled with codependency and stayed in draining friendships because I didn’t know how to set boundaries. Over the last couple of years I’ve been doing the hard work: therapy, CoDA meetings, and learning to hold healthier limits. Part of that meant pulling back from my parents; our relationship has always been difficult, and for my own peace I now keep contact minimal.

A year ago, I stepped away from the friends I had because those relationships weren’t healthy either. I truly believed that once I created space, the right people would come in. Since then I’ve thrown myself into new things: salsa dancing, tennis lessons, scuba diving, volunteering, different Meetup groups, church communities, and fitness classes. I didn’t just sample them: I stuck with many of these for close to or more than a year. I keep showing up, but I still come home to an empty phone, with no one to call for a simple coffee or a walk.

I want connection, not just more activities. I value depth, reciprocity, and a sense of ease with people. What I want most is simple: to be a wife and a mom, to have a home filled with warmth. I’m about to turn 41 and sometimes I feel like I have nothing to show for all the effort I’ve made.

I’m willing to look at my part in this if I’m somehow sabotaging connection. But I can’t tell if I’m the problem or if I’m just in a long, lonely season despite doing the right things.

I’m sharing this from a vulnerable place, so I’d be grateful if responses could be insightful and free of criticism. ",1,1760012722.0,selfhelp,1,1.0,False
1o24hux,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1o24hux/is_it_worth_trying_strattera_unsure_about/,Is it worth trying Strattera? Unsure about Methylphenidate experience,"I’ve been taking methylphenidate XL for almost a year. It was first prescribed by my GP after my diagnosis (unusual practice), and now I’m under official titration under the private service who diagnosed me.

I take 20mg or 30mg lately. I can’t work out what’s best for me. I like to have a coffee in the morning and I can on 20mg without a problem with my blood pressure, but the focus I get from it isn’t perfect, my mind drifts in meetings and though I do tasks around the house I still have 4 things I go between when cleaning. On 30 my focus is better, but I can’t have a coffee. 

If my day is perfectly calm, I’m not having a problem with anxiety with these doses. The problem is I do have a stressful job working in mental health with children and families, so I find my stress kicks in more and I get a racing heart over things that I don’t need to be as stressed about. I also have an autoimmune disease which is worsened by stress, so I’m not sure if stimulants are right long term because of this. I also feel it’s hard for me to not be productive if I’ve taken it. On the weekend it’s hard to just relax and do nothing if I see things I could be doing, when I was never like this before. I also laugh more with my partner when I’m not medicated, and I lose a bit of my silliness on meds.

I’m nearly to the end of titration and they’ve offered to confirm the dose and medication now to have the GP take over prescribing, but I’m now curious if something like strattera could be good to try first before we choose the medication for good. What would you do in my situation? I know stimulants have the best results so if it is working pretty well, I don’t know if I should change it up. Anyone had experience switching to Strattera from methylphenidate? Thanks 😊",1,1760012662.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

- Amendoado: Aroma dos grãos lembra muito paçoca rolha. Pouca acidez também, um pouco mais encorpado que o anterior. Muito bom.

- Chocolate: não senti muito o chocolate no aroma, mas é o mais cremoso dos quatro. Bem encorpado, acidez média, sabor bem marcante. Gostei muito desse.

# 🍫 Chocolate Stout (Voss Kveik Edition — No Temp Control)

**Batch Size:** 1 Gallon (3.8 L)  
**Target OG:** 1.065  
**Expected FG:** 1.016  
**Estimated ABV:** \~6.5%  
**IBU:** \~25  
**Color (SRM):** \~40 (black with ruby highlights)  
**Boil Time:** 60 minutes  
**Mash Temp:** 67°C (153°F)  
**Fermentation Temp:** 30–35°C (ambient, fine for Kveik)

# ✅ 1. Ingredients

# Grains (Total: 1.25 kg)

|Grain|Amount|Purpose|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Weyermann Pale Ale Malt|**850 g**|Base malt|
|Weyermann Carapils|**100 g**|Adds body, head retention|
|Weyermann Caramunich Type 1|**100 g**|Light caramel sweetness|
|Joe White Chocolate Malt|**100 g**|Chocolate flavor|
|Weyermann Carafa Type 2|**100 g**|Deep color, smooth roast|

*(Reduced crystal content = better balance; still full-bodied and flavorful)*

# Hops

* **East Kent Goldings (EKG)** – total **12 g**
   * 10 g @ 60 minutes
   * 2 g @ 10 minutes

*(Gives \~25 IBU — smooth, earthy bitterness)*

# Adjuncts

* **Lactose:** 50–75 g (adds sweetness and creamy body)
* **Cacao nibs:** 20–25 g (for post-fermentation, soaked in vodka/bourbon 24 hrs)
* **Yeast Nutrient:** 1–2 g @ 10 min

# Yeast

* **Lallemand Voss Kveik** — use about **½ packet (2–3 g)** for 1 gallon. You can even sprinkle it directly into the cooled wort — no need to rehydrate.

# ✅ 2. Brew Day Process

**Mash (60 minutes):**

1. Heat **6.0 L** of water to **72°C (162°F)**.
2. Add your crushed grains in a mesh bag and stir.
3. Stabilize mash around **67°C** for **60 minutes**.
4. Lift and drain the bag — gently squeeze to recover wort.
5. You should have \~5 L pre-boil volume.

**Boil (60 minutes):**

* 60 min: Add **10 g EKG**
* 10 min: Add **2 g EKG**, **lactose (50–75 g)**, and **yeast nutrient**
* End of boil: Turn off heat, stir gently, and begin cooling.

**Cool & Ferment:**

1. Cool the wort to around **30–35°C** (Voss’s comfort zone).
   * An ice bath or cool tap water is fine — no need for full chilling.
2. Take your **OG reading** (should be around 1.065).
3. Transfer to sanitized fermenter and pitch yeast directly.
4. Ferment at **ambient temperature (30–35°C)** — ideal for the Philippines.
5. Expect fermentation to finish in **3–4 days**, maybe even faster.

**After Fermentation:**

* Once bubbling stops and gravity is stable:
   1. Soak **20–25 g cacao nibs** in **just enough vodka or bourbon** to cover them (12–24 hrs).
   2. Add nibs + soaking liquid into fermenter.
   3. Let sit **3–5 days**.

**Bottling:**

* Siphon beer into bottles, avoiding sediment.
* Add **1 Coopers carbonation drop per 330 mL** (or **2 per 500 mL**).
* Cap and store at room temp for **2–3 weeks**.
* Chill and enjoy after 4 weeks — flavor improves for another month.

# ☕ Flavor Notes (Expected)

|Character|Description|

|**Body**|Medium-full, creamy, smooth|
|**Sweetness**|Slightly sweet but balanced|
|**Bitterness**|Gentle and round|
|**Roast**|Chocolate and light coffee, no burnt taste|
|**Yeast Aroma**|Subtle orange-marmalade or stone fruit notes from Kveik|
