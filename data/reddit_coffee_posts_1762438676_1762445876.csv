Then used my raw data on other platforms: IllustrativeDNA, Sequencing and NexoGENO. 

I'm Brazilian-Uruguayan, with both colonial roots and more recent immigrant ancestry. This is my known background: of my 16 great-great-grandparents, 7 were born in the Iberian Peninsula (2 in Catalonia, 2 in Ibiza, 2 in Andalusia, and 1 in the Douro region), 5 in Italy (3 in the deep south and 2 in the north), 2 in Uruguay (of unknown origins), 1 in Germany and 1 in Brazil (the son of a white coffee plantation owner and an enslaved Black woman).

  
The pictures anexed:

  
1) Sequencing's autosomal results,

2) GENERA's autosomal results,

3) GENERA's haplogroup results,

4) Illustrative DNA's HG and Bronze age results,

(Think SEO, Paid, Content, Not Just the Hype)","Let’s get real for a second. If you scroll Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, or YouTube lately, you’d think every marketer’s built the ultimate workflow:

“I built an automation on n8n that, before I’ve even had my first coffee, pulls new keywords from my GSC, ranks them by business value, spins out hundreds of long-tails using AlsoAsked, generates a 2000-word blog post, whips up five images, publishes it, cuts three hour-long videos and seven shorts for every social channel, schedules the posts, launches LinkedIn ads, and somewhere in there, probably solves world hunger too.”

But let’s put the sarcasm aside… who here has actually implemented a real, working automation, using n8n, Make.com, Zapier, etc. at scale, in a legitimate business with $4–5 million+ in revenue?

I’m not asking about tiny experiments or demos with zero results. I want specifics:
•	Real AI-driven SEO (GEO, AEO, SGE)
•	Automated paid media and campaign live-optimization
•	Content marketing and publishing, start to finish

Sometimes I just feel overstimulated from both my baby and toddler and want to just have no weight physically or mentally on me for a moment. 

And then of course when I want to be present and baby wear when we are on a family outing, my MIL is dying to take my child from me and it's my opertunity to relax, be present with my baby and hold them close. It makes me feel guilty because I do have more opportunities with my baby than her, but it's my baby!

# Volume-Based Insights: Pinpointing Institutional Footprints

Volume analysis serves as a crucial barometer for institutional activity. Our data reveals a striking concentration of trading interest, with 240 stocks experiencing 2x+ their average volume, and 135 exceeding 3x. The highest volume ratio recorded at an exceptional 107.9x underscores intense focus on select counters.

**Key Observations from Volume Leaders:**

* **Exceptional Accumulation:**
   * **CCL Products (India) Ltd (NSE:CCL):** A staggering **107.9x** average volume, coupled with +9.38% DTD and +14.27% WTD, indicates aggressive institutional accumulation. This robust volume-price action in the Tea & Coffee sector suggests a strong positive catalyst.
   * **Redington Ltd (NSE:REDINGTON):** With **21.6x** volume and a remarkable +14.75% DTD and +9.87% WTD, this Trading & Distributors stock is seeing significant buying interest, potentially reflecting optimism in tech distribution or consumer spending trends.
   * **Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltd (NSE:PRIVISCL):** Demonstrating **15.4x** volume and impressive gains of +11.12% DTD and +13.06% WTD, this specialty chemicals player is clearly attracting substantial capital, pointing to sector-specific tailwinds or strong company fundamentals.
   * **FLAIR (NSE:FLAIR):** **30.3x** volume with +5.98% DTD and +9.45% WTD highlights strong interest in the Stationery sector, potentially indicating recovery in education/office supplies or a specific growth story.
* **Sectoral Volume Surges:**
   * **Consumer-Related:** Strong volume and price action in Tea & Coffee (CCL Products), Stationery (FLAIR), and Household Appliances (Butterfly Gandhimathi Appliances Ltd, 21.2x volume, +3.26% DTD) indicate renewed investor interest in consumer discretionary and staples segments.
   * **Chemicals:** Both Commodity Chemicals (Andhra Sugars Ltd, 26.5x volume, +6.29% DTD) and Specialty Chemicals (Privi Speciality Chemicals, Apcotex Industries Ltd - 18.9x volume, +10.40% DTD) are witnessing heightened activity, suggesting positive outlooks or strong demand.
   * **Infrastructure/Manufacturing:** Gujarat Pipavav Port Ltd (14.5x volume, +5.43% DTD) and WEBELSOLAR (Other Electrical Equipment, 15.8x volume, +10.07% DTD) are signaling capital allocation towards infrastructure and renewable energy plays.
* **Mixed Signals:**
   * **NDR Auto Components Ltd (NSE:NDRAUTO):** High volume at **16.9x** but with slight negative daily and weekly returns (-1.21% DTD, -0.63% WTD). This could indicate profit-booking, rebalancing, or a period of high-volume consolidation after a prior move. Investors should monitor for clarity.
   * **Easy Trip Planners Ltd (NSE:EASEMYTRIP):** Despite **16.2x** volume, price movement is minimal (+0.50% DTD, +0.25% WTD). This may signify rotation within the sector, high-frequency trading, or accumulation at current levels without significant upward pressure yet.

The prevalence of high-volume, positive-momentum stocks strongly suggests institutional accumulation in these specific quality names, indicating conviction in their near-term prospects.

# Sector Leadership Among Quality Stocks

Analyzing the broader quality universe reveals distinct sector leadership patterns, hinting at a rotation towards certain themes:

* **Emerging Strength in Consumer & Discretionary:** The robust performance of stocks like Redington (Trading & Distributors), Butterfly Gandhimathi Appliances (Household Appliances), and FLAIR (Stationary), all with high volume and strong positive returns, points to a resurgence in consumer confidence and spending. This suggests a potential shift from defensive to more cyclical consumer-oriented sectors.
* **Persistent Interest in Specialty Chemicals:** Building on volume insights, the continued strong performance and high volume in names like Privi Speciality Chemicals and Apcotex Industries underscore sustained investor confidence in India's specialty chemicals segment, driven by domestic demand and export opportunities.
* **Infrastructure & Manufacturing Revival:** Gujarat Pipavav Port and WEBELSOLAR's activity, along with other industrial names showing positive weekly momentum (e.g., Aarti Industries), suggest a steady, albeit selective, flow of capital into infrastructure development and manufacturing capabilities.
* **Pharmaceuticals - A Mixed Bag:** While a traditional defensive sector, the performance within pharmaceuticals is varied. Some names like Ajanta Pharma (7.60% WTD) show strength, others are consolidating or correcting. This indicates a focus on specific sub-segments or company-specific catalysts rather than a broad sector-wide rally.
* **Financials - Selective Play:** Large-cap financial players and holding companies like Bajaj Holdings And Investment (14.7x volume, +8.11% DTD) are attracting attention, suggesting targeted interest within the financial sector for stable and well-managed entities, distinct from a generalized financial upswing.

This environment reflects a discerning market, prioritizing sectors and stocks with clear growth narratives or strong tailwinds, rather than a uniform ""buy-all"" approach.

# Price Momentum Analysis: Identifying High-Conviction Moves

Momentum is a critical factor for institutional investors seeking alpha. Our analysis identifies quality stocks exhibiting compelling price performance across multiple timeframes:

* **Daily (DTD) Outperformers:**
   * Redington Ltd (NSE:REDINGTON): +14.75%
   * Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltd (NSE:PRIVISCL): +11.12%
   * Apcotex Industries Ltd (NSE:APCOTEXIND): +10.40%
   * WEBELSOLAR (NSE:WEBELSOLAR): +10.07%
   * CCL Products (India) Ltd (NSE:CCL): +9.38% These stocks are indicative of immediate, high-impact buying interest.
* **Weekly (WTD) Strongholds:**
   * CCL Products (India) Ltd (NSE:CCL): +14.27%
   * Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltd (NSE:PRIVISCL): +13.06%
   * Redington Ltd (NSE:REDINGTON): +9.87%
   * FLAIR (NSE:FLAIR): +9.45%
   * IGIL (NSE:IGIL): +8.63% The consistency of these names across daily and weekly charts suggests robust underlying conviction and sustained buying.
* **Monthly (MTD) Breakouts:**
   * A-1 Acid Ltd (BOM:542012): +69.09% (Note: High monthly gain with low daily volume, warrants deeper fundamental check)
   * ACUTAAS (NSE:ACUTAAS): +31.51%
   * ABDL (NSE:ABDL): +24.44%
   * 3M India Ltd (NSE:3MINDIA): +22.85% (A large-cap, high-quality name showing sustained momentum) These longer-term trends point to established upward trajectories, often driven by fundamental improvements or structural shifts. The strong MTD performance of a diversified conglomerate like 3M India, even with current day's consolidation, highlights underlying strength in quality large-caps over a broader timeframe.

The confluence of strong daily and weekly momentum in names like CCL Products, Redington, and Privi Speciality Chemicals suggests these are currently in strong uptrends, potentially signaling technical breakouts or significant shifts in market perception.

# Trading Opportunities: Actionable Insights for the Quality Portfolio

For institutional and serious retail investors, the intersection of strong price momentum and confirmed volume activity in quality stocks presents compelling trading opportunities. The focus remains on sustainable trends and risk-managed setups.

**High-Conviction Setups (Strong Volume & Price Momentum):**

1. **CCL Products (India) Ltd (NSE:CCL):** The exceptionally high volume ratio (107.9x) paired with significant daily (+9.38%) and weekly (+14.27%) gains makes CCL Products a standout. This could be a liquidity-driven breakout. Further fundamental review for catalysts is advised, but technically, this represents strong institutional accumulation.
2. **Redington Ltd (NSE:REDINGTON):** With a 21.6x volume ratio and impressive DTD (+14.75%) and WTD (+9.87%) returns, Redington is demonstrating a clear uptrend. Its role as a major distributor offers exposure to consumer electronics and IT, a potentially resilient segment. This looks like a continuation play or a fresh breakout.
3. **Privi Speciality Chemicals Ltd (NSE:PRIVISCL):** Exhibiting strong price action (+11.12% DTD, +13.06% WTD) on a 15.4x volume ratio, this stock signifies robust interest in the Specialty Chemicals sector. This momentum could be indicative of sector-specific tailwinds or company-specific growth drivers.
4. **FLAIR (NSE:FLAIR):** The significant volume (30.3x) and positive price momentum (+5.98% DTD, +9.45% WTD) suggest a strong underlying demand for this Stationery stock. This could be a good candidate for a medium-term position, capitalizing on sectoral recovery.
5. **Bajaj Holdings And Investment Ltd (NSE:BAJAJHLDNG):** As a large-cap holding company, its 14.7x volume ratio and +8.11% DTD gain are notable. This indicates significant capital allocation towards a quality, diversified entity, possibly for its underlying portfolio value or as a defensive play within the financial sector.

**Quality Names for Longer-Term Accumulation/Monitoring:**

* **3M India Ltd (NSE:3MINDIA):** While daily returns were slightly negative, its robust weekly (+21.20%) and monthly (+22.85%) performance, combined with a respectable volume ratio (4.99x), suggests sustained institutional interest in this diversified quality large-cap. It could be an opportunity for accumulation during minor dips.
* **Gujarat Pipavav Port Ltd (NSE:GPPL):** A consistent performer in the Ports & Port Services sector with 14.5x volume and positive DTD (+5.43%) and WTD (+7.94%). This signals a favorable outlook for infrastructure and logistics, offering a relatively stable growth opportunity.

**Risk Management:**  
For all identified opportunities, prudent risk management is paramount. Consider setting appropriate stop-loss levels based on technical analysis (e.g., below recent swing lows or key moving averages). Position sizing should be aligned with portfolio risk tolerance. While volume and price action signal conviction, further due diligence into company fundamentals and any specific news triggers is always recommended.

1oq31ou,https://www.reddit.com/r/ResumesATS/comments/1oq31ou/just_use_your_network_to_find_a_job_most_terrible/,"""Just use your network to find a job""... MOST TERRIBLE ADVICE","Everyone keeps telling me to ""just use my network"" to find a job. I spent 100+ hours this year talking to job seekers and honestly? That advice is making people worse, not better.

Let me explain what I'm seeing.

First, it's so vague it's almost useless. ""Use your network"" could mean literally anything. Message everyone on LinkedIn? Ask for a referral? Send a cold DM to someone you haven't talked to in five years? Most people interpret it as ""beg your friends for help"" and then feel ashamed when they strike out. That's not networking, that's desperation with extra steps.

Second, and this one's brutal, most people actively job hunting have already exhausted their network. They've called their parents' friends, hit up college buddies, reached out to former colleagues. There's no magic list of hidden connections that suddenly appears. If there was a fit in their network, they'd have found it already.

But here's the thing that really gets me about this advice: it's not fair. Building a strong network takes years. Sometimes generations. You know who has the best networks? People born into privilege. People who went to Ivy League schools. People whose parents knew people. It's the most inequitable piece of advice we keep pushing on job seekers like it's some universal hack.

I get why people say it though. Referrals do work. But here's the data everyone ignores: Greenhouse (one of ATS providers that own the biggest market share) found that referrals made up like 10% of hires. Sound good? That means 90% of all hires weren't referrals. Seventy percent. But we keep acting like networking is the only path to a job.

It's not.

I talked to this one guy who spent three months obsessively networking. Coffee chats, LinkedIn messages, reaching out to second and third degree connections. He got nothing. Meanwhile his friend spent two weeks applying to 30 jobs on job boards, tailored each one to the posting, and landed two interviews. Got an offer from one.

The networking advice isn't wrong. It's just incomplete and it's destroying people's confidence when it doesn't work.

Here's what actually works based on what I'm seeing: Apply to 20-30 jobs per week on the boards where real jobs actually live. Not LinkedIn. I'm talking Wellfound, Welcome to the Jungle, Indeed, those places. Tailor your resume to match what they're looking for (i've already posted about how to properly tailor your resume for each application [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ResumesATS/comments/1o92w6n/i_worked_for_two_of_the_largest_ats_providers/) & [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ResumesATS/comments/1ohie97/the_resume_that_passes_ats_and_makes_recruiters/)). Pick one to three target title and stick with it. Add a summary section at the top that shows impact in the first line.

That's it. That's the system. It's not glamorous. It's not about leveraging your connections or being some networking ninja. It's about consistent, targeted applications to real opportunities.

And yeah, always be networking. If someone reaches out, talk to them. If you meet someone cool, stay in touch. But don't treat it like your job search strategy. Treat it like what it actually is: something you do over time as a bonus, not your main engine.

The hustle culture machine wants you to believe there's some secret sauce. Some magic networking move that opens all the doors. There isn't. Referrals are great when you have them. But 90% of people find jobs without them. That's the real story nobody wants to tell you.

Keep applying. Be consistent. Pick your target. Tailor thoughtfully. That's the boring, unsexy, but actually effective way.

The networking stuff? That's a bonus, not the foundation.",1,1762445421.0,ResumesATS,0,0.67,False
1oq2yn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtoNYC/comments/1oq2yn7/moving_from_maryland_to_nyc/,Moving from Maryland to NYC,"Hey everyone!

Taking a new role with my company that requires me to move to NYC. The good news is that I don’t have to rush, my new manager would like me to be there by May-June 2026 at the latest. I’m budgeting $3400 for a 1 bedroom, and while my office is in Midtown, I would much rather live in Queens (as I had family living there for many years and I love the borough shout out Forest Hills!)  with that being said I have a couple questions:

1) I am considering Astoria, LIC as my two main areas given proximity to the city and mid town but any other Queens neighbors to check out, Jackson Heights perhaps? 

2) I’ve been using apartments.com, Streeteasy so far but I’m wondering if a broker might be helpful? Then again since I’ve got 5 months to find a place is that extra fee worth it? I’d love to hear any feedback on that front.

Big things for me at 35M is I love to eat and want to be around able to hit up good food especially good food so you know I got my eye on Flushing! I also want a good social scene to meet people, I’ll do my part to get out there as well oh and I love a cozy coffee shop!",1,1762445236.0,movingtoNYC,2,1.0,False

1oq2x6r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oq2x6r,My skin journey and results . Hope it motivates you💚,"This before pic was around 1 year back and it progressively got worse for the next 4-5 months, to the point that I had given up on my skin and stopped clicking photos. This is just my forehead but my situation was same on the whole face! It was way worse than this but my android was unable to capture it.

What I used and how I discovered everything without a dermat(I don't have good dermat around me):

My skin was never great but never this worse too. Using salicylic acid facewash 2x a day without sunscreen and moisturiser triggered this and coffee consumption made it worse. Yep my skin hates coffee🤷‍♀️.

Lets begin;

I saw hype of plum 2% niacinamide sunscreen and bought it because I had given up on my skin and was okay with anything. Miraculously my cheek bumps started to fade in a week and I was happiest. This made me realise my skin loves niacinamide. Than, I bought 5% niacinamide serum and 3% toner from plum. Toner did nothing for me but serum was a winn. This was what cleared soft bumps but my skin still had congested pores and hard bumps. Deep black marks were cherry on top.

Than I went down the rabbit hole to research and found Azelaic acid! God I lovee it. I started directly with 20% without a dermat. I researched, did patch test and used very less quantity. I eventually discovered how my skin likes it.

My current skincare:

PM ingredients: random gentle cleanser, glycerin water toner i made myself(1:5), aziderm 20%. 

I initially cleanse, spray glycerin-water toner. Once it settles, I apply aziderm, than after 20-30 minutes I again spray the same toner and dab it onto my skin.(I use minimalist 2% SA+LHA facewash 2-3x a week by mixing 3-4 drops of it with my cleanser)
MY HG right now: glycerin and azelaic acid💚


AM: Just water splashed. Since I don't go out often, I skip sunscreen at home. Sunscreen is something I am still researching on but if I have to go in the sun, I use Derma co or Rhoto(japanese brand, I don't like it). If I don't have to go out, I spray glycerin-water toner even at the morning(So cheap and good😭). I use dermaco 5% nia-ceramide moisturiser only if I cleanse in the morning or if my skin is very dry.

I do still have a few bumps here and there. Most probably because my date is near. I hope this motivated you to keep experimenting since not everything works for everybody.

I am happy to answer any questions💚

Been living in Japan for a while or learning Japanese but still don’t get many chances to actually talk with locals?

I totally get it, even if you live here, it’s not always easy to have real conversations in Japanese. Most people are busy, and language exchange apps can feel awkward or one-sided.

So I started offering casual Japanese chat sessions, no grammar drills, no pressure, no “sensei vibes.” Just relaxed, natural conversation with a native from Osaka.

You can talk about everyday life, culture, travel, work, or even Kansai-ben (Osaka dialect) if you’re curious.

I also speak English (lived in Australia for 11 years), so beginners are completely welcome.

Prep your coffee ☕, it's not a sitting in a classroom session.

If you’re looking for a chill way to practice real Japanese, this might be for you:

Hey everyone! 👋  
Welcome to the community! If you’d like to make a post introducing yourself or looking for friends, here’s a simple format you can use as a guide. Feel free to tweak it however you want!

**💬 Intro:**  
Start by saying hi and sharing how long you’ve been Faithless. You can also say what brought you here — e.g., wanting to connect, make friends, share experiences, etc.

**🎓 A bit about you:**  
Add a few fun facts or hobbies! This helps people see if you share similar interests.

**🌍 Location & Age:**  
Let others know roughly where you’re from and your age range — it helps people find nearby friends or ones in the same stage of life.

**🚫 Lifestyle stuff (optional):**  
Totally optional, but you can mention things like:

Examples:

* I don’t drink much but enjoy game nights or coffee meetups
* Not into smoking or clubbing — I prefer chill social stuff
* Into travel, fitness, or quiet hangouts over big parties

**✨ Bonus (optional but fun!):**  
Add a random fact or “starter question” to make your post more interactive.

**💡 Tip:**  
Be yourself! You don’t need to overshare — just enough for others to get a sense of who you are. This sub is for building friendships and support, so kindness and respect go a long way 💕",3,1762444872.0,AtheistMatch,0,1.0,False

1oq2rkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/1oq2rkg/any_recommendation_for_a_good_scooter_lock/,Any recommendation for a good scooter lock (without spending too much)?,"I just bought the new Segway Ninebot MAX G3, and I’m looking for advice on a decent lock setup. I don’t want to spend a ton on a super high-end U-lock, but I’d like something secure enough for short errands, easy to carry, and not too bulky.

Before this, I had an older Ninebot G30 scooter that was way cheaper and used a thin cable lock; never had any issues. But now that I’ve upgraded to a brand-new, more expensive scooter, I’m a bit more concerned about leaving it outside when I go places like the gym, coffee shop, or grocery store. Other than that, my scooter will be parked in my garage.

I must mention that I live in a pretty safe, upper-middle-class neighborhood where crime is rare. People park their scooters and bikes around all the time.  Some even leave them completely unlocked, but I’d still like to be smart about it.

What type of lock do you all recommend for this kind of situation?

I was the gifted kid all through school. Straight A's. AP classes. Honors society. Valedictorian. Full ride to a good university. Graduated magma cum laude. It was my whole identity.

Now... I don't know when it happened. Maybe two years ago? A year ago? It feels like a switch flipped. I can't do it anymore.

I'm doing the absolute bare minimum to not get fired. My boss, who used to praise me, now has that concerned tone in our 1:1s. I just nod and say ""yep, working on it"" knowing full well I haven't done anything. I'm drowning in tasks I used to be able to do in an hour.

I am so, so tired. I feel nothing. But I also feel this crushing, screaming anxiety all the time.

I keep thinking I'm just lazy. My parents worked so hard. I have all this privilege and opportunity and I'm just... wasting it. I'm not depressed, am I? I don't feel sad. I just feel... gone. Weekends are the same. I have no energy to see friends. I just lie on my couch and order food and watch TV i'm not paying attention to. I don't know what this is.

1oq2oky,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetaReaders/comments/1oq2oky/in_progress56kromance_the_love_vector/,[in progress][56k][Romance] The Love Vector,"Fish out of water boy/girl college age romance. He's attending an all girl's university for his final semester. (more on that as the plot develops) She's his campus guide and they're lab partners. Mostly looking to see if my characters are fleshed out and not just Mr. And Mrs. Perfect. Also looking to see if the plot makes sense, needs more drama, or any suggestions at all really. It's my first attempt at writing so any help at all is appreciated. Thanks in advance. 

It's my first day at Marjorie J. Drew University, and I can't help but feel like the proverbial fish out of water. Not only is this an all female university, I'm only here for my final semester in my bachelor's program. I'm likely to be the only confused looking senior on campus, but according to my welcome email I got after enrollment I'll be provided with a campus guide for a couple days. I pull my coat tighter around myself as a particularly potent gust of wind whips by. Calling it “Spring semester” in Pittsburgh, is some kind of cruel joke. The campus is blanketed in white, as can be expected in January I suppose, but I can see many trees which will make this a beautiful campus when spring does actually arrive. The admissions office is my first stop and is between the parking lots and the quad so it should be easy to find. Just as I expect, it's the most prominent building from the main entrance to campus. A beautiful brick building with massive pillars adorning the front from ground level to the roof. They look more decorative than supportive but they fit the architecture style in a building I assume has been here since before the civil war. I make sure to knock the snow off of my boots before entering. A wall of warmth greets me immediately on my entry provided by a fire crackling merrily in a large fireplace in what looks like a cozy living room setting with easy chairs, a love seat, and a coffee table complete with assorted magazines. I can already tell nothing here will be what I'm used to. Sure there was some old architecture at Penn State but this is… different, homey even. As I approach the office area one of the employees glances up from what she's doing and smiles when she sees me coming. “Hello, you must be Alex?” “Yes I'm Alex I think I'm supposed to meet…” I pull out my cheat sheet I printed last night looking for the pertinent information. “Dean Montgomery?” “Yes she's expecting you. Her office is just over there.” She motions to an office across the room and I thank her before heading that way. The walls are lined with pictures of different buildings on campus labeled with their dates of construction, and in some cases, restoration. I knock on the Dean's door and after a moment it opens revealing a middle aged woman with her brown hair in a tight bun wearing a peach pantsuit completing her look, is a no nonsense face that I've grown accustomed to seeing on university faculty. “Have a seat Mr. Brown.”",1,1762444647.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

It tasted very plain like vanilla or caramel.  I almost always just shrug stuff like that off and take what I'm given even if it's wrong but today I decided if I was gonna drink that many calories, I wanted what I ordered.

I drove all the way back to to Dutch Bros and they seemed really confused but made me a new one anyway. I could see it being made from where I was sitting outside. I saw the peppermint syrup go in, I saw the candy cane sprinkles on top. I got back to my car and it tasted exactly the same. No peppermint flavor, no chocolate flavor, heck I couldn't even taste any coffee. It was just a big cup of thick, warm (not hot) chocolate milk and cream.

Now I'm almost certain I didn't get the wrong drink the first time and I kind of feel bad about asking them to remake it but it is not what is expected when ordering something that's supposed to taste like chocolate and peppermint.

If it’s good for your heart, it’s probably good for your performance too.

That’s because both rely on the same thing — **blood flow.**  
When your blood moves smoothly, oxygen and nutrients reach your muscles and nerves better.  
That includes the ones that control arousal and stamina.

Poor blood flow, on the other hand, means weaker erections, faster fatigue, and less control.  
That’s why what you eat every day matters more than you think.

Some foods are basically natural “boosters” for your circulation:

* **Beet juice** – packed with nitrates that turn into nitric oxide, relaxing your blood vessels and improving flow.
* **Watermelon** – contains citrulline, which also helps produce nitric oxide naturally.
* **Pomegranate** – full of antioxidants that protect blood vessels and improve stamina.
* **Green leafy veggies** – spinach, kale, and arugula help your arteries stay flexible and strong.
* **Nuts and dark chocolate** – healthy fats and flavonoids that support healthy blood pressure.

There’s research to back it too.  
Studies show that foods rich in nitrates and antioxidants can **boost nitric oxide levels** — the same mechanism behind most erection meds.  
Except this comes from food, not pills.

**Try this:**

* Start your morning with beet or pomegranate juice instead of soda or coffee.
* Add greens to one meal a day.
* Snack on nuts instead of chips.

Over time, you’ll feel the difference — more energy, better recovery, stronger control.  
Healthy blood flow doesn’t just make you last longer — it makes everything feel better.",1,1762444350.0,Overcome_PE,0,1.0,False

Besides the initial intended purpose of joining le a the train buses when my local train line was being renovated, I used it to travel with regional trains or local trains when my colleagues and I have visited clients in the car (bike in the trunk). 

Had a single flat on brand new Continental Urbans - obviously the day where I look the train to a different part of the country (DK) to do a presentation. Called a taxi, drove to the venue to do my job, taxi to the nearest LBS, bought a tube, replace the tube and biked to the train station. Easy 😅. 

I received the bag this week and rolled to Copenhagen centre to do some political campaigning (municipality elections) - handing flyers out to bike riders i Copenhagen during rushhour.

Basically I was hoping to get a Hello Kitty plushie today. I asked one of the baristas, who I think is a manager? I go to this store often and they know who I am and we've built up a good rapport. Anyway they said they didn't get any holiday merch in and neither did several other stores. I guess they put in a ticket and they said to check on Thursdays, so I'll check back next week even though I know it'll be red cup day and a madhouse. Again I'm not blaming any baristas; I'm sure they're going through hell right now with these launches.

Sex: Female

Location: Rural northeast USA

Height: 5'8

Weight: 150

Medications:

* Mirena IUD for the last 15 years (I'm on number 3)
* Current supplements (I have started these in the last month as an attempt to improve liver / gut health):
   * B-Complex
   * N-Acetyl Cysteine (1,000 mg)
   * Women's Daily Care 40 Billion CFU Probiotic
   * Vitamin E (400 IU)
   * Zinc (50 mg)
   * Magnesium Glycinate, Chelated (200 mg)

Drugs / alcohol: I do not drink, smoke or use recreational drugs.

Habits: I generally drink 100-120oz water a day (mostly well water but it has tested clean). I have on average 2 mugs (12 oz each) of coffee a day. I used to drink almost daily but have not had any alcohol in 5 years. I've only been doing physicals / lab work for the last 4 years, but everything has been in normal range. I hike around 2 miles, 5 days a week. My work is seated at a desk, but I am active throughout the day doing chores, walking the dog, etc.

The issue: For at least a year, I have smelled very strongly of onions, and through intimacy have also found that I taste even worse. This has not always been an issue, although I can't pinpoint when it started because I previously spent a lot of time alone. The smell/taste has persisted since at least one year ago, likely 2-3 years. I do feel the smell/taste is specific to areas where there are apocrine glands. I can very consistently notice it in armpits, vagina / around vagina, and nipples. I know it may seem benign compared to other issues, but it is affecting my mental health, my relationship, my interest in being intimate, my interest in being around people at all, etc. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like if I am more than 30 minutes out of the shower, I can't even raise my arms or I'll be noticeably smelly. I went shopping a few weeks ago and realized I shouldn't even try on shirts because I will make them smell. All of my shirts are being ruined and I have switched to wearing mostly large, cotton t-shirts. I feel like this odor is coming from WITHIN me. I don't sweat excessively, I just smell strongly. I have an appointment with a dermatologist tomorrow, but I feel weird for even going, and like I am wasting their time because I don't know if it is even the right doctor to see. I only know they deal with apocrine sweat glands. I'm not imagining this, it isn't phantosmia - I have confirmed with multiple people. It is not from eating onions.

Things I've tried over the last 10 months (which did not help at all):

* stopped eating alliums (including garlic and onion) 10 months ago
* switched to as much cotton / breathable clothing as possible
* quit coffee for 2 weeks
* quit gluten for 1 month
* quit sugar for 1 month
* tried doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for a month, thinking it could be some bacterial thing on my skin
* regulating hormones with Drospirenone and Ethinyl Estradiol 3mg/.03mg for 2 months (reminder I also have a Mirena)
* various deodorants and soaps that have helped cover the smell, but not fix it
* recently did an elimination diet and for 20 days, I ate only plain chicken, sweet potatoes, lettuce, white rice, apples and black coffee. There was no improvement, so I concluded it is not a reaction to what I am eating and began reintroducing other foods. I realize I probably could have quit coffee as well during this time, but from what I understand, coffee may *increase* sweating but not cause an oniony odor and so I kept it to have some small joy.
* Tried Prozac to help with anxiety, and then tapered off Prozac
* Tried taking supplemental fenugreek but it just covered the smell with more smell

I shower daily and generally do not eat fast food, I try to live a healthy life. I am anxious, but could this be caused entirely by anxiety, with no ebb and flow to the smell/taste? I could understand if it was bad on a highly anxious day, but it is always bad. Sometimes my armpits smell like onions as I'm stepping out of the shower having just washed them. I'm desperate to solve this. I have read similar stories from other women on Reddit, but no doctor I've spoken with seems to have ever heard of smelling/tasting like onions.

Any advice on who to see next, what labs to do, what things to try, the cause, etc, I very very much appreciate. I will respond to any and all questions.

Thank you!!

1oq2f0p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oq2f0p,Newhaven double murder: Derek Martin jailed for life for killing Chloe and Josh Bashford,"Photo: Sussex Police

A man who murdered a young couple at their home in Newhaven has been sentenced to life imprisonment.

Derek Martin, 67, of Moulsecoomb Way, Brighton, walked into Brighton Police Station on the evening of 9 June 2023, telling officers: “I’ve killed two people.”

He admitted causing the deaths of Chloe and Josh Bashford, but denied murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility, claiming a depressive disorder.

After a three-week trial at Lewes Crown Court, sitting in Brighton, a jury found him guilty of two counts of murder on 24 October.

Martin was sentenced on 6 November 2025 to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 29 years, reduced to 26 years, seven months, and seven days for time already served.

“Driven by rage and resentment”

Sentencing him, the Honourable Justice Thornton KC said the murders were “driven by rage and resentment” and paid tribute to the Bashford families for their “dignity throughout the investigation.”

She told Martin:

“It is clear that Chloe and Josh were loving, and loved. As a result of your actions, their families will suffer for the rest of their lives.”

The day of the killings

The court heard that Martin appeared calm and went about his normal routine on the day of the killings — having coffee at Costa in Newhaven and later breakfasting with Chloe at The Stonehouse restaurant in Peacehaven.

They later returned to the Bashford family home in Lewes Road, where Chloe, 30, lived with Josh, 33, and their four children.

Martin told police he was cleaning windows when he “just flipped” during an argument about money. He struck Chloe with a hammer before stabbing her to death.

When Josh returned home, he saw Martin holding a knife and ran upstairs. Martin chased him, repeatedly stabbing and then strangling him.

Afterwards, Martin changed clothes, picked up the couple’s four children from school, and took them to Costa and McDonald’s in Newhaven — discarding Chloe’s phone in nearby bushes before returning the children to their grandmother’s house in Brighton.

He later drank beer on the Whitehawk seafront before walking into Brighton Police Station to confess.

Vital clue from prison

While on remand, Martin saw a Sussex Police appeal for Chloe’s missing phone and passed a handwritten note to a prison officer detailing where he had thrown it. The phone was recovered and provided crucial evidence in court.

Police statement

Following the sentencing, Detective Inspector Sam Legate, from the Surrey and Sussex Major Crime Team, said:

“Today marks the conclusion of a long and complex investigation into the brutal murders of Chloe and Josh Bashford at their home in Newhaven.

The loss suffered by their family and friends is difficult to comprehend, and our thoughts remain with them. They have shown amazing strength and courage throughout the investigation, and no outcome will ever make up for the heartache they continue to endure.”

He added his thanks to the public and colleagues, saying:

“While today’s sentence cannot undo the immense suffering he caused, I hope it provides reassurance that Sussex Police will continue to thoroughly investigate major crimes and seek justice for victims.”

tldr; I built a 100-card Magic: the Gathering commander deck for €7 so that if you're interested in playing with your friends, but don't want to commit a large amount of money, you can jump right in.

___

I've been a fan of the Avatar universe since it aired, and like a lot of you, grew up with the show! I'm also a huge Magic: the Gathering player and so, when the new set was announced I was super hyped. 

For a lot of you, these cards might just be from some ""nerdy card game"" that some of your friends play, or you've seen being sold at a local game store when you go and pick up a board game or play D&D. I think even *normal stores* are selling booster packs for it now, so it's pretty much unavoidable. 

Now, I'm not going to teach you how to play (there's already loads of great pieces on content on this, and I actually recommend Magic Arena for getting to grips with it), but if you already have a few friends with some decks or you want to head down to your local Friday Night Magic event, you might want to dive into, what is now Magic's most popular format, Commander. 

Commander features 100-card decks which includes a ""commander"" - a single card that, usually, signposts what the deck is all about. However, these decks can get pricey. There are pre-constructed decks you can buy, but even these are around $40/£40/€40 and for some, that's still too much to invest in something you might not really be familiar with. 

That's why, I've built a [Fire Lord Azula](https://scryfall.com/card/tla/220/fire-lord-azula) deck that costs a total of €7!! That's all! For the price of a fancy cup of coffee you can jump into a game and play. 

The deck sees you slinging spells, making Azula powerful and smashing your opponents' faces in and I hope you enjoy it! I won't go into all the details of the deck here, as this isn't an MTG subreddit, but feel free to check out the decklist or if you're really interested, the showcase video.

* Releases ghosted last-minute: *Eh, let's not risk it today.*
* **Friday night deploys** (The ultimate cry for help, why are we doing this to ourselves?).
* Rollback button is technically there... but does anyone *truly* believe it'll save your ass at 3 AM? **Spoiler:** Crickets.

It's a system and **soul debt**. We gotta design for humans, not just code.

The CI/CD that actually scales? It's boring AF, in the best way:

* Builds fire up in the **exact same environment every single time**. No more work on my machine, BS.
* Tests mirror **real user chaos**, not just lab-rat edge cases. (Pro tip: If your tests feel fake, they probably are).
* DB migrations are a **pre-deploy ritual**, not a mid-party surprise.
* Every single feature is **feature-flagged from Day Zero**. Ship fast, toggle off even faster.
* Rollback is **30 seconds of oops, fixed.** Zero war room drama.

My main goal is I do not want cavities, decay, or enamel erosion, which is why I do the whole flossing, brush, mouthwash routine each time I eat or drink.

They have only been here less than a week and I am having an issue. I work nights I come back home around 6:30 am and then go to bed. My husband is usually up so I make him a coffee/ breakfast before I turn in. 

Just something  like to do, more quality time before he heads to work. I asked my son and Emily if they would also like coffee or breakfast before they go to work. 

They said no to food but yes to coffee. That was easy and I just made two extra cups. I asked them to tell me if they want me to change how to make their coffee. I thought they would just tell me, use this cream or if they had a preference on blend.

Emily texted me last night and said she left instructions for the coffee. 

This morning I came home to very detail instructions how to make a complex coffee. It was like a Starbucks drink, she wanted foamed milk on top, different syrups, a specific coffee bean ( ground fresh…) and a difffernt brewing method ( we have a drip coffee machine) most of the stuff was one the counter.

I decided I wasn’t doing that and just made the normal coffee. Emily wasn’t happy and we got into a argument before she went to work

I basically told her I am not a Starbucks barrista and I am not going all that. She told me I shouldn’t have offered in the first place if I wouldn’t make the coffee to her liking. We left on a sour note.

I have been getting texts from my son about not being hospitable so I am having trouble sleeping at the moment

Bungalow 23 has been our most requested location and, with the cold weather coming soon, we wanted to have one more outdoor Meet. I'm going ahead and posting a few days earlier than normal since the holidays are coming up and we know many people are either making plans or already have plans. 

Bungalow 23 – Fun for All Ages (and Pups too!) They're a family-friendly, dog-friendly community beer garden with plenty of open space to relax. Surrounded by 4 great bars and restaurants, it’s the perfect spot to gather, sip, and enjoy good vibes with friends, family, and furry companions. Their current on-site places include: Chick N Beer, Chinos Mexicano (asian mexican fusion), Egg N Caphe (vietnamese coffee), and Downtime (neighborhood bar with darts game). The outdoor area has cornhole, Connect 4, giant beer pong, a pool table, a very large TV screen(likely showing the OU x Alabama game), and lots of seating. They are being super kind and offering happy hour drinks while we are there(details in pics above)! Closing time is midnight, so feel free to stay late, as many of us often do. That's also for people who may need to arrive later since I'm certain that lots of us will be around until they close. I've linked their Instagram  and Facebook pages below, as well. 

Parking is located on the northwest corner of the block near NW 24th and Shartel and another lot is directly east of Chick N Beer. These are shown in pics above. 

Again, I want to thank you all for supporting our local businesses and we are excited to show Bungalow 23 the same positive vibe that we have brought everyone and everywhere prior. 

The usual info below:

People can feel free to come and go as they please and we feel this will provide a more laid back atmosphere for everyone to mingle and move around. It's all about relaxing, having a good time, and meeting new people. Some of us will arrive early and have orange leis to make us easier to find, which we will provide for everyone. So, if you see someone wearing an orange or red lei then it should be okay to approach them and verify our location and grab a lei.

I will do my absolute best to DM as many people as possible, however, it may be a good idea to follow my posts so that no one gets left out. We are very grateful for everyone's interest and hope that as many of you can make it as possible. I'm going to edit in the link to my previous post below. Do not hesitate to reach out to me at anytime, if you need.

If you're new to town or just wanting to get out, whatever your reason, we hope that you find a way to attend. We aim to provide a fun, low-key, and family-friendly environment for everyone to just chat and chill. No pressure.

Hope to see you all there!!

Who do you call for assistance for this poor girl?

Realizing she's vulnerable and with nowhere to go, I called crimecheck to report what happened and ask for some assistance to help this girl, since I don't feel good about sending a vulnerable girl who's clearly in crisis back out into the cold.

They took the report and said someone will be responding... Great.

Meanwhile my girlfriend got her some clothes, shoes, some coffee and helped comfort her.

I started calling around to see if I could find any other help, I called Jewels helping hands, and while the were nice, they're not able to send someone out to pick her up.

I called 211 but since it wasn't ""business hours"" it hung up on me. So I went to their site and tried looking up services... there was one listed, but again it wasn't business hours. I called another shelter, but it turns out it was for teens.

6:15am I called crimecheck back to see if they were sending someone, they said the call was still ""open"".

I then called 988 for mental health crisis hotline and in the process of giving the operator the info to get this girl some help, she left. Said she was going to go to the shelter...

this is the day for bold vision and gratitude. jupiter doesn’t respond to desperation; it responds to confidence, ethics, and devotion. your energy must already believe it deserves increase. when you give thanks before the gain, the universe fills the container you’ve already built.

the ancient pulse of jupiter’s day
	•	ancient rome: thursday was dies jovis, dedicated to jupiter, the god of thunder and divine law. his priests poured wine and honey to thank him for victory and abundance. merchants made deals and signed contracts under his protection, believing his lightning struck down deceit.
	•	greece: zeus ruled oaths, prosperity, and fate. temples to zeus the bringer of rain were visited on thursdays to bless fields and ensure fruitful harvests. gold and olive oil were common offerings — symbols of both power and nourishment.
	•	norse culture: thor’s day honored thor, whose hammer safeguarded people and crops. his storms broke stagnation and revived the soil. the same energy clears blockages in money and momentum spells today.
	•	west african lineage: thursday aligns with orishas like obatala and olodumare — energies of elevation and clean fortune. acts of giving, especially to elders or the poor, were believed to open new channels of wealth.
	•	vedic astrology: brihaspati (guru), teacher of gods, rules thursday. his power expands wisdom and material blessings for those who act with integrity. fasting or wearing yellow on this day was said to strengthen prosperity and spiritual clarity together.

⸻

how to work with thursday energy
	•	light a gold or yellow candle. carve your name, business, or goal into it. anoint with cinnamon, clove, or honey. as it burns, say: “my blessings grow easily and truthfully.”
	•	feed your abundance altar. add coins, bay leaves, or nutmeg. clean it, polish metals, and leave an offering of honey or wine to thank what already sustains you.
	•	speak prosperity aloud. jupiter rules voice and belief. say what’s coming as though it’s already here — not to convince the universe, but to convince your cells.
	•	practice generosity. buy someone coffee, tip big, or donate to a cause. expansion begins when energy moves outward first.
	•	journal on growth. write about how you’ve already expanded — in wisdom, skill, or strength — not just money. jupiter rewards awareness of progress.

⸻

thursday correspondences
	•	planet: jupiter
	•	element: fire and air
	•	colors: royal blue, purple, gold
	•	herbs: basil, bay leaf, cinnamon, nutmeg, sage
	•	crystals: amethyst, citrine, tiger’s eye, lapis lazuli
	•	deities: jupiter, zeus, thor, obatala, brihaspati
	•	offerings: honey, wine, bread, coins, yellow flowers

1oq1xam,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1oq1xam/pub_brewery/,Pub & Brewery.,"So me and my husband went to visit our best friends a couple weekends ago and they wanted to show us this place that was downtown where they live. They said that it is a pub and brewery they also serve brunch, well that’s what we decided to have so we went around 11am on a Saturday and I got a Irish coffee ( btw this was my first Irish coffee) i don’t know what I expected of this drink but oof. The first couple sips were nice but as I kept drinking it kept getting stronger and stronger, like I mentioned we got there around 11am when we were sat all I noticed was families with kids and couple of strollers. 

Like a lot of them I would like to mention that this place (not the actual name)  “the name pub and brewery” so I was a bit confused when I noticed all these kids and baby’s. The Irish coffee like I mentioned was strong but anyways we have not hang out and gone out with our best friends in a while so we wanted to have a good time. But how could I have a good time ? While I am tipsy I cuss like a sailor ( I am also a Latina not all of us but me I am loud especially when drunk) i don’t know about anyone else but I don’t want to be worried about someone else’s kids hearing me cuss. 

Where we were sat there was 2 families on both side of our table top one had a stroller so I’m sure they could hear us, anyway I left them a google review letting people know that it seemed more family oriented. Like I kid you not there was about 2-3 strollers in their dining room area I mentioned In my google review ( which I left them 3 stars on atmosphere because of that ) that we went for brunch, they have dinner also but not gonna lie this place was a bit over priced. 

Well a couple days after I left my google review the “owner” replied to my review and suggested that their upstairs bar/brewery ( which only opens at 4pm ) would be more “my vibe” that comment rubbed me the wrong way because It’s not like I was asking them for anything but why have “pub and brewery” in your business name when it’s giving restaurant instead? When our best friends ( also CF ) lived closer to us we used to go to breweries quit often until we started noticing all these families and kids at the breweries. Does that not take away from the brewery experience ? People want to have drinks & listen to live music in peace without worrying about screaming/crying kids, running around or running into random people. When did breweries & pubs became so family oriented ? Why is it happening ? 

Honestly I feel like there is no “adult only” spaces unless it’s a sex shop or smoke/vape shop, a hookah lounge or a liquor store. Bars are not even safe and I am speaking from experience cause I used to bartend and I had to turn people away cause parents wanted to sit at the bar with their baby or toddler.

I am shocked.,"I've been a stay-at-home dad for the last 14 months with my two kids (6 and 3). I decided it was time to get back to work and started applying for jobs.

I went through a somewhat tough 4-stage interview process for a very promising job at a government agency. They offered me the job, and I accepted. After I had the offer in hand, I informed them that my wife is eight months pregnant.

At first, they were very good about it. The hiring manager told me, ""Congratulations, that's not a problem at all, we're a very flexible workplace."" Honestly, I was very relieved.

Then they mentioned that their HR department is notoriously slow and the paperwork would take a long time. The start date they proposed was about a week before the baby's due date.

I figured it would be best for everyone to lock in a final start date. I asked if we could push the start date back another 3 weeks, so I would start two weeks after the baby arrived. This way, there would be no uncertainty, and I wouldn't have to immediately request time off as soon as I started.

The manager seemed totally receptive when we met for coffee. He showed me the office, I met some of the team, and we agreed and shook hands on the new start date. He even told me ""family first"" and not to worry. I left feeling really happy about everything.

A week later, I got a sudden email from him. It said that ""due to my new family circumstances,"" they had decided I was no longer a good fit for the role and were rescinding the offer. Just like that.

I know the logical response is ""you wouldn't want to work for a place like that anyway."" But I'm genuinely in disbelief. This feels like blatant discrimination, right? I'm torn between letting it go and moving on, or raising hell with his manager or someone higher up. This experience is making me very anxious about how other companies will perceive a ""stay-at-home dad"" applying for a job.",3,1762442843.0,Resume,3,0.8,False

1oq1uvy,https://v.redd.it/l01hzuitlnzf1,How much would you charge for this? and similar videos,"Hey everyone,

A few days ago I shot a small montage for a local café — basically **for the price of a coffee**.  
No planning, no briefing, nothing. I just showed up, filmed for about an hour, and edited it later.

**Gear used:**

* Sony ZV-E1
* Weebill 3S gimbal
* ND filter
* Editing: roughly 3 hours (I made two versions)

The client loved it, and now I’m trying to figure out **what I should actually charge in the future** for something like this.

I started putting together some package ideas, but honestly… I have **no idea** whether these prices make sense or if I’m completely underselling myself.  
I’m based in **Germany**, for context.

Here’s what I came up with:



# Starter Package – ~690 €

* Short pre-planning & strategy call
* 1 hour on location
* 4 edited & captioned social-media videos (Reels / Shorts)
* Basic color correction & sound cleanup

# Growth Package – ~1,280 €

* Pre-planning + content strategy
* Half-day shoot
* 8 edited videos
* Color grading, sound design, social-media optimization

# Viral Package – ~2,215 €

* Full content strategy
* Full-day shoot
* 15 professionally edited videos
* Storytelling, hook optimization, advanced color grading
* Optional analytics & monthly review



These are my **first thoughts**, but again — I genuinely don’t know what the “right” price range is for my market or skill level.  
I see agencies here charging 2–4× more, but I’m still building my portfolio, so I don’t want to overshoot or undersell myself.

**What would be reasonable pricing for this kind of work in Germany?**  
Especially for quick shoots like the café montage.

It feels like they’re treating ordinary food as some novelty just because it’s in Japan, instead of actually noticing what is unique. What frustrates me is how they’ll label everything as ‘Japanese style’ as if being in Japan automatically makes it special. It comes across as lazy cultural framing — they aren’t describing real differences, just using Japan as a branding tool instead of engaging with the food authentically.

**THE SNIFFENING II:**

**BPAL Dahlia:** -much sniffing- ""This is unique. I like it. This one is really good."" _(I don't have a lot of vanilla in my collection so I love that Vanilla is unique lmao. It is really nice though.)_ 

**Sugar & Spite Black Mamba:** :((( ""Hard 5 year old bubblegum."" _(💀 Why is it so specific??)_

**Morari Seashell Vanille:** -lots of sniffing and thinking- ""Just like.... beach? Actual beach. It's definitely beach."" _(Definitely beach indeed.)_ 

**Arcana Pineapple Whip:** ""Oh! :D That is fruity! Like citrusy? No. It's Pineapple Upside Down Cake! It smells like the syrup for the cake. I like it."" _(Man knows his pineapple.)_ 

**BPAL White Honey, Lemon Peel, & Salt:** -intense sniffing- ""Orange peel? That not it. It's citrusy but specifically like the skin or the seeds. And something sweeter."" _(Weirdly accurate citrus peel call out.)_ 

**Sorce Moon Magic:** -sniffs- :| -sniffs again- ""Oooh. The first sniff was very different from the second. The first was very ~perfume~ but now it's like Cinnamon roll. It smells like Craft! :D"" _(Craft is our fav local bakery that does indeed make a chai cinnamon roll and lavender lattes lmao)_ 

**Pulp Glamour Ghoul:** ??? :((( ??? ""I don't get this. I don't like it. It reminds me of something specific from childhood. Not bleach but like...an interaction with bleach?"" _(accidentally unlocked childhood trauma????)_ 

**Cardinal Sand Castle:** -deep contemplation- ""It just.... smells like the ocean? Just beach. My job is beach."" _(Suddenly onset Barbie jokes.)_

I work from home, and as nice as it is not commuting, it’s made my world a little too small lately. Same desk, same coffee mug, same playlist… you get it.

I miss spontaneous conversations, the kind that make the day go by faster or make you smile for no reason. I’m just looking for someone to talk to, share random thoughts, vent about work and life, or make each other’s days a bit more interesting.

I’m chill, open-minded, and appreciate good humor and honest conversation. If you’re also stuck in your routine and could use a little spark in the middle of the day (or night), message me.

Modeling scams and unsafe situations do happen, so here are basic safety rules everyone should follow:

1.**You can bring someone**. If a “scout” or “photographer” says you can’t bring a parent/friend/chaperone to a first meeting or shoot, that’s a red flag. Legit people care about safety.

2.**Meet in public first**. Coffee shop, studio with a business address, or agency office > random apartment or remote location.

3.**Verify the company**. Google the agency/studio name, check their website, check their Instagram, and email the official address listed on their site to confirm the person works there. Don’t rely on just a DM.

4.**No rush / no pressure**. “You have to decide right now” or “don’t tell anyone” = walk away.

5.**Tell someone where you’re going**.Share location with a friend/family, drop the address, and turn on live location (Life360, iPhone Find My, etc.).

6.**Trust your gut**.If the vibe is off, leave. You don’t “owe” anyone a shoot.

7.**Report sketchy contacts**.If someone is pretending to be from a real agency, contact the agency through their official website and ask them to confirm.

8.If you get a message saying they’re from “X Modeling/London/Premier/etc.” and you’re not 100% sure, go to the official website and email their safety/contact address — most legit agencies will confirm if a scout is real.

If you (or anyone here) has a verified warning — meaning you’ve got emails, agency confirmation, or a platform takedown — you can add it in the comments with proof so people can judge for themselves.

If you really think a specific person is pretending to be with an agency or trying to lure people, the best path is:

1.Screenshot the message

2.Contact the real agency through their site to verify

3.Report to the platform where the contact happened

4.If it looks criminal, report locally

The highlight is collaborative journals, shared brew logs where multiple people can run experiments side by side. Want to see how a washed Ethiopian performs across V60, Origami, and Kalita? Or what happens when a few of us brew the same beans at different temps? That’s the simple idea.

It's 3 a.m. in the morning and I can't sleep. Life gets boring sometimes. I'm wondering what activities I'll do to keep myself busy and I decide to go through my phone gallery.

I come across a photo of James aka the welder, I still remember James and his taciturn nature.



Let me take you a step back, we met with James as I was having my lunch at Greenview restaurant, some fish fingers and chips. I was honestly famished and they always come in handy. I jumped on my plate immediately I was served, no frittering, I was done in a few minutes and then that's when I notice this guy seated across my table staring at me. He came closer and I noticed he wasn't that tall and his face was average, but he had a Breitling Bentley motors watch, he was amiable and he offered to clear my lunch bill. 



James unlike other men who like to chase, was direct, he asked that we meet for coffee at Pronto. The date was going well till he said, "" I wanna be with you for a weekend, I wanna suck your labia and bury my head between your thighs and tush till you climax and fall on the floor."" I was startled and I found that statement really daunting but I stayed tranquil and told him, "" I'm a modest woman and not a whore, I'm old fashioned and I like being courted."" 

 

James listened and told me that he's a businessman and he often knows that everything has a price. "" I'll give you 500k for a weekend in Diani, I'm always negotiating even for things that shouldn't be."" I felt disparaged at first but the monetary compensation made me feel worthwhile. James left and gave me 20k for my hair and nails. 



I agreed, I have never seen such a figure of course I'll take the bait. I think morality reaches where your pockets reach after that most of us can do anything.



Diani was ok. We spent time together and he left to close a few business deals, he came back with a bottle of Dom Perignon Champagne and we talked a lot, he asked for my account number and he deposited the money as 600k, he told the 100k was for my troubles. That night I learnt he was divorced. I asked him, ""Why didn't you use the long route?"" James said, "" I think the end goal of every man is to see the woman he's interested naked and bent over, whatever means you use to get there doesn't really matter."" 



James took a sip of his champagne and said, "" do you think if I'd asked you to marry me right away you would have said yes?"", of course I said  NO. ""You see"" he said.

 We slept next to each other that night and I was slightly disappointed. 



The next morning he came in after his workout, smiled and walked into the shower, I washed my face and brushed my teeth and then I followed him to the bathroom naked and held him from the back, he smiled and turned around, silent apart from the kisses and moans, you washed and massage each other first. You were both burning under the cold spray by the time you were through. Then, he pinned you against the wall, and you lifted a leg to welcome him as he slid into you. 

For the first moment, he stayed still, while you felt and stared at each other. He started to move slowly, but with the poky space, and slippery floor, it got awkward quickly. You hurtled out and bounced on the bed still wet, water and body fluids. He went down  on you, while you wrapped your legs around his head, his right hand gripping your left buttock, while his left hand circled your nipples. James was amazingly different from my ex—savvier, kinkier, unselfish. My racking orgasm was a pleasant surprise. As you pulled his hand from my clitoris because it was too intense. His beard was wet and you smiled, he looked at you and you noticed his member was so hard that it could burst, he slid into me and I wrapped my legs around his waist, his rhythm thrusts were so intense that I felt every inch of his member as it went in and came out, my orgasms came in quick successions till I squirted, something that has never happened. So, I pushed him gently off me till his back was on the bed. I knelt between his legs, pushed them apart, cupped his balls, slurped his penis till he burst in my mouth and hand.



The night after was short, I came back to Nairobi using the Jambo jet and he called his chauffeur and he made sure I reached home safely. 



It has been 3 years and the 600k is now around 2.5m. Damn, God is always making men; some are tall, others short. Some hate women, and others love them too much. Some shower three times a day, while others don't believe in soap. Some are cruel, and others are cowards. But every once in a while, you come across a proper man who makes you rethink your singlehood, and I'm lucky enough to have met one, even though he slipped away.

It’s hard to support local businesses when the customer service isn’t up to par.,"Came to this coffee shop while I was downtown getting my car fixed. Customer service (ww) was very mediocre. Very sad because the coffee and food is good (Won’t be back though). 

I’ve gotten to that stage where I’m comfortable cooking at home and I actually like my home cooking and I like improving on it,so every time I go out and get terrible service or terrible food (especially in this economy), I just stop going there. It’s been very empowering for me lately. But at the same time, do white people not like money anymore? Like why are you standoffish when I’m coming in to spend money? 

I didn’t leave because it was a 25 minute walk to get there so I figured I’ll just use the free Wi-Fi and when my car is done in three hours, I’ll just leave. Usually I would just walk out though.

I do try to support local black businesses in the area, but to be honest with you it’s mostly a lot of fried foods and it’s not really something that I eat often anymore. We do have a local BW owed bookstore (I have yet to go there though). 

I’m getting a lot angrier with this nowadays, like I recently went to Von Mauer and there was a lady literally following me around the store and I actually went there to buy something.

Instead it is loaded with a lot of glucose related stuff and bad chemicals. but somehow it eliminates my insomnia.



Ingredient of this sahlep powder is: Starch (potato,tapioca), sugar (20%), skimmed milk powder, coffee whitener (glucose syrup, fully hydrogenated vegetable oil (coconut), stabilizers (dipotassium phosphate, sodium polyphosphate), milk protein, emulsifier (mono and digliycerides of vegetable fatty acids), anti-caking agent (silicon dioxide) maltodextrine, lactose, dextrose, flavorings, anticaking agent (tricalcium phosphate), cinnamon, thickener (xanthan gum), salt, sweetener (sucralose), sahlep powder (0.01%)

each sachet of this powder is 15 gram and I add it to hot milk and mix it.

Hot milk alone has a very mild positive effect. But if I add this powder to hot milk it eliminates my insomnia.



I am 45 yo male. 72 kg and 183 cm height. gaining weight and muscle is very diffucult for me. an ultrasound report in 2021 says I have grade one fatty liver. my serum and ionized calcium levels looks a little low. (around 1.16 mmol/L (1.12-1.32)

why do you think this might be helping ? things that comes to my mind;

1. sugars in that powder  causes a big insulin spike and force some nutrients like trytophan tyrosine potassium  phosphorus etc into cells. maybe I have insulin resistance. maybe some sort of brain diabetes.

2. it could be potassium deficiency. ı tried salted watermelon last summer and it had some mild positive effect but when I tried same thing with cantaloupe nothing happened.

2. starch feeds some type bacteria or organism and they release some beneficial chemical or do not release chemicals that trigger stress hormones

  
3. calcium load might be helping but eating a big chunk of cheese does not do same thing.

4. cinnamon might be increasing insulin sensitivity. but I tried cinnamon alone and did not get same benefit.

My mom, Helen, called me last Tuesday. She’s 82.

""Michael,"" she said, her voice thin over the phone, ""I need you to help me buy a new television. A big one. A 'smart' one.""

I almost laughed. My mom still uses a boxy Magnavox from 2003. She tapes her favorite soap operas. She thinks ""streaming"" is what a leaky faucet does.

My first thought? Annoyance. Pure, unfiltered, middle-aged-son annoyance. I’ve got a project deadline that’s breathing down my neck. My daughter has a travel soccer tournament in Wisconsin this weekend. The markets are volatile. And now, I have to play tech support and fight off some fast-talking salesman at an electronics big-box store.

""Mom, just tell me what you want, I'll order it online,"" I said, already clicking my mouse. ""It'll be there in two days. Easy.""

""No,"" she said. The word was quiet, but firm. ""I... I need you to come with me. To the store.""

The sigh I let out was heavy enough to feel. ""Fine, Mom. I'll clear an hour. I'll be there around two.""

I drove the familiar 25-minute route to the suburbs of Detroit, to the little 1960s ranch house I grew up in. Faded gray vinyl siding, the big oak tree my dad planted now towering over the roof.

Dad's been gone for three years. The house has been too quiet ever since.

I walked in, and the smell hit me—that specific, trademarked scent of ""Mom's House."" Faintly of the pot roast from Sunday and... Pledge? Yes. Lemon Pledge.

She was waiting by the door, already in her good coat, slippers swapped for her ""going out"" shoes.

""Okay, Mom, let's go,"" I said, keys still in my hand. ""We've got to beat the traffic.""

""Oh, good,"" she said, but she didn't move toward the door. She shuffled into the kitchen. ""I put a pot of coffee on. Can we... can we just sit for a minute?""

I looked at my watch. 2:10 PM. My internal clock was screaming. This is inefficient. A 40-minute round trip for a 'minute' of coffee?

But I sat. At the old Formica table, the one with the chrome legs and the faint cigarette burn from my Uncle Frank back in 1985. The one where I’d scratched my initials with a protractor in ninth grade.

She poured two cups of coffee—the same instant brand she's been drinking for 40 years.

We talked. Not about anything important. Just... things. The neighbor's new roof. The fact that the squirrels are getting too fat from the bird feeder. She asked about my kids, and I gave her the usual, ""They're good. Busy.""

I was antsy. My phone buzzed on the table. An email from my boss. A text from my wife about the hotel for the tournament. I glanced at it.

""Oh, you're busy,"" she said, starting to get up. ""We can go...""

""No, Mom, it's fine.""

She sat back down. Then, she reached across the Formica and put her hand over mine. Her skin was like paper, but her grip was familiar.

""Michael,"" she said, looking at my phone, then at my eyes. ""I don't really need a television.""

I froze.

""I asked about the TV,"" she whispered, ""because I didn't know how else to get you to come over. It's the only thing I thought you'd think was 'worth the trip.' I... I just get so lonely.""

That sentence broke me. Right there at the wobbly kitchen table.

It shattered me into a million pieces.

This woman—who sat on freezing aluminum bleachers for every high school football game I ever played.

This woman—who worked extra shifts at the Hudson's department store for an entire Christmas season just so I could have a decent, safe car when I turned sixteen.

This woman—who packed casseroles and leftovers into plastic containers for me to take back to college, worried I wasn't eating enough.

She gave me her entire life. Her time, her energy, her youth.

And now, in her smaller, quieter world—a world shrunk by age and loss, a world where my dad's empty coffee mug still sits, clean, on the counter—all she needs is the one thing I treat like a scarce commodity.

An ordinary Tuesday afternoon.

She felt she had to invent a problem to get her son to visit. She had to create a ""task"" so my visit would feel ""productive.""

I realized how often I've done this. How many times I've said, ""I'll call next week,"" or ""I'll stop by when things slow down."" How I've let work, bills, meetings, and the endless, screaming noise of my own ""urgent"" life take priority.

We tell ourselves our parents ""understand"" that we're busy. We think our ""like"" on their Facebook post is ""checking in."" We send a text. We order them groceries on an app and call it ""taking care of them.""

We are fools.

A text message is not a conversation. A grocery delivery is not a hug. A ""Happy Birthday"" post on their wall is not the same as sitting in their kitchen, breathing the same air, and listening to the same story about the fat squirrels for the tenth time.

That's the currency of their world now. Not dollars. Not achievements. Not efficiency.

Just presence.

When I finally looked up, my eyes stinging, I realized the house didn't feel empty at all. It felt... full.

Because I was there.

I realized when she said she was ""lonely,"" what she really meant was: ""When you're here, I feel like I still matter.""

She felt seen. She felt loved. She felt like her life, in this quiet house, still had meaning—because I showed up.

We never went to the electronics store. I stayed for two hours. We drank that bad instant coffee and just talked. I put my phone in my coat pocket and left it there.

One day, I know I'll drive down that familiar street, and the porch light won't be on. The kitchen will be dark. The kettle won't whistle. The chair by the window—the one she waits in, watching for my car—will be empty.

And I know, with an ache that already terrifies me, I would trade every ""urgent"" meeting, every project deadline, every soccer tournament, every dollar I've ever chased... for one more ordinary Tuesday. One more cup of terrible coffee. One more hour to just... sit.

If you're reading this, and you're lucky enough to still have them, go.

Don't wait for Christmas or Thanksgiving. Don't wait for a ""reason."" And God forbid, don't wait for them to have to invent one.

Go sit at the old table. Drink the bad coffee. Listen to the story you know by heart. Put your phone away.

Because to them, your time isn't just a visit.

It’s not an ""errand.""

It’s love.

It’s life.

How it started:

In January I started a lifestyle change with flipping my diet and working out more. I was losing weight, and by February is when I had my first attack. I was up for the gym and then my stomach started just burning. I’ve never felt anything like it before and it lasted 10 minutes. Thought nothing of it and went about my day. This kept happening in the mornings right before the gym, sometimes right as I opened my eyes. 

Overtime they got more intense, lasting longer and instead of just burning it’d be burning, pain, my mouth watering from nausea. 

These happened one or twice a month. Went to my PCP in May, he suggested an ultrasound for my gallbladder. I got it but there was no inflammation, tiny stones, no sludge. Since it “wasn’t bad” I figured I could just push it off for now (girl wrong!!) So I just continued changing my diet and eating smaller meals as this seemed to help. Until it didn’t. 

Even with the small meals sometimes it would be set off for no reason. I never had consistent triggers. It would just be random. But I did notice if I wasn’t drinking enough water that would increase my chances of having an attack. 

I will note i never had the issues with stool that people talk about. I did continue to eat what I wanted, just smaller portions. Only hard no was like super fried things. 


ER Visit:

This September, on a Friday while working (WFH) I had a snack at 4pm. A taco and a literal SIP of Dr Pepper zero. As soon as I took the sip, my stomach started to burn. Paced my room until this feeling subsided enough to finish my shift. However the pain was still there, and noticeable. It was coming back hard and none of my usual remedies were working. I couldn’t get comfortable and I was crying in pain. My urine was VERY yellow which is not normal for me at all. I eventually called for my roommate at 11pm and by coincidence his partner who is a nurse was there for the evening. After looking at me they were like we’re going to the ER. 
They gave me IV fluids and pain killers and ran some tests. My AST and ALT were in the 400s and 200s. Bilirubin was high. Lipase was normal. ER had me admitted to the hospital for observation and I had an MRI done. I was there Saturday morning to Sunday afternoon.  My AST and LST peaked at 615 and 462 during observation. I was discharged because I had not blockages and my levels were trending down Sunday morning. They gave me a referral to a surgeon and strongly suggested having it out before this happened again. I agreed because that pain was too much (also the hospital bill for Saturday-Sunday???? Insane)


Surgery:

I found a surgeon through my PCP because I did not like the bedside manner of the guy I met in the hospital. My consult with him went well and he explained that choosing to do it before things truly take a turn is the way to go. Will also make for an easier recovery. Booked my surgery for Nov 3.

I’m so SO scared of hospital and surgery. I was crying my eyes out in pre-op. Thankfully my surgeon and anesthesiologist were very comforting during this. I was very worried about my blood pressure. High BP runs in my family and in pre op I was so nervous it was 150/117. My surgeon joked saying “you trying to hit the record?“ then he went further to joke some more saying “We’re not worried, we got drugs that can make it whatever we want” 

As I was taken to the OR, I was given the magic “I don’t care juice” that everyone talks about and man that stuff was GOOD. I went into the OR feeling so chill and didn’t mind anything lol. I remember them putting the mask on me and I was in recovery! I don’t even remember falling asleep. 

As soon i was out of recovery and in the area where you wait to be discharged, I got up to pee and walked myself (nurse close by just in case). 
I only got nauseous while getting dressed but didn’t puke!


Post Op:

I am now 3 days post op and mostly myself again. The first day post was the hardest in that the gas pain was tough and the anesthesia had fully worn off. I had a weird moment where everything peaked at once and I was in so much pain. That was the only time I took the big pain killer. 

The prescription grade ibuprofen is all I needed the rest of the time. I haven’t needed any today! 

I have been eating mostly home made chicken soup I prepped and the night before. And smoothies. Yesterday I ventured into eating some fun things I have: leftover pot roast and rice (small serving) and a chocolate chip cookie. 
Today I had coffee and it made me gassy, but honestly that was a thing before my gallbladder issues even started lol 


Pathology has come back: 

While imaging only showed stones. I actually had sludge and chronic inflammation. Multiple stones with max size being 0.3cm.

TLDR; The thought of surgery was so much worse than what actually happened. I’m thankful I listened to my surgeons advice to do it before things got out of hand. Imaging isn’t always a perfect picture of what’s going on inside. I know not everyone has the opportunity to do so, but if you do I highly recommend it!

### Training
I booked this race as soon as I got the opportunity, which was in January via Abbott's Age Group World Champions (AGWC) scheme, in the age category 65-69. There was extra cost, but also a few perks like a Wave 1 start and a dedicated tent in the start village, plus it sounds grand! I booked the flights and hotel; then in April ran Manchester marathon and qualified (just!) to run as an England Masters Representative in the Abingdon Marathon. That also seemed like a great opportunity, though it was just two weeks before New York. I figured I would run Abingdon in the best time I could manage, and then run New York without worrying much about the pace.

I trained therefore for Abingdon, using the Pfitzinger and Douglas 18/55 schedule from their book Advanced Marathoning. I added some extra miles where possible, on the basis that high mileage would help me with the intensive fortnight to come. Peak week over the training period was 71.5 miles. Three week taper for Abingdon in the normal way, that race went well and I got a PB of 3:25:33.

I was then into two weeks of recovery/taper for New York, punctuated by a 10 mile race in the middle weekend. Ran that with a 10 mile PB, then on the Thursday headed from the UK to New York.

On Saturday I ran the Abbott Dash to the Finish Line 5K with my wife, intending to run it as a shake-out at around 8:00/mile. This is a delightful race with around 10,000 runners, from the United Nations building through the streets of Manhattan and into Central Park, with the finish being the same as for the marathon the following day. I ran a little faster than planned and was surprised to find myself 3rd in age category, perhaps because most marathon runners in the race were more sensible and saved their legs.

Saturday afternoon though things began to fall apart. We had been in all sorts of crowds and queues, at the airport and on trains and planes, at the expo, near the Village Parade (Halloween celebration) on Friday evening, and more. I picked up some kind of mild bug; I didn't feel right, my nose was blocked and my throat was sore. With these things, you never know if it is the beginning of something worse, or something that will soon clear up. I did the best thing I could think of, which was to sleep as much as possible. So at 20:00 I was in bed with the alarm set for 4:00am. It was not an easy night as fretted about how I felt, and whether I should even run at all. Missing the race would be wretched after so much preparation and getting to New York; on the other hand, running while sick could make a mild illness much worse.

Luckily I made a good recovery overnight; and who knows, maybe there was a touch of maranoia in there too. My nose was clear, my stomach was fine, and the sore throat nearly gone. Got up, grabbed my start bag, and headed for the subway to the New York Public Library and the 5:00am bus to the start.

### Pre-race
Arriving at the library at 4:45am was confusing at first. There were buses in front of the library but no queues and it took me a while to figure out that the you had to wait at the back of the library, where I joined hundreds of other runners and began to feel a bit of race excitement. The bus, we were warned, could take up to 90 minutes. In practice though it took less than half that time, presumably because of the early hour, and we were unloaded into a cold, pitch-dark start area at at about 5:40am, three and half hours before the race started.

I had been told that the start village is not a great experience and so it proved. The first challenge was to find the AGWC tent; the signage was not brilliant but after wandering around for a bit I figured out that there are several different colour villages, and that my village was orange. A volunteer pointed me in the right direction and I found the AGWC area which actually had two tents with plastic seats, the same bagels and coffee that were on offer everywhere, and some dedicated portaloos. There were nowhere near enough seats for everyone so I sat on the grass in one of the tents, grateful that it was a bit warmer than outside, and chatted to some other runners. One told me that she had done a 100 mile race two weeks ago, and the Marine Corps Marathon (MCM) a week ago, which made my own schedule look easy. Tapering is overdone, she said, adding that she ran for the experience not the performance.

At around 8:10am we were led round to the start corral, went in an milled around for a bit, then decided I should do a bit of warming up, exited the corral and ran round in circles with some others, doing perhaps half a mile at easy pace. Then back into the corral before it closed at 8:45. I felt OK and ready to start.

As we got near to the start time of 9:10am the ribbons dividing Orange A B and C were removed and we moved up to the bridge and the start line. I consumed my first gel. Frank Sinatra sang New York New York. At last, after the most complicated race logistics I have encountered, we were running.

### Race
The marathon begins with a slow gentle climb up the bridge and everything was fine. I tried to hold about an 8:00/mile pace which would get me a 3:30. The weather was perfect and the crowd support started as soon as we arrived into Brooklyn; it was amazing. 

All went well until about half way; pace slipped a bit in miles 11 and 12 but not badly. After mile 13 though I began to slow down. It was not hitting the wall; it was just fatigue, combined with three other factors:

- I was not at my best after feeling unwell the day before
- I had run intensively over the previous two weeks including a marathon, a 10 mile race and then the Dash to the Finish Line 5K
- The time did not matter that much to me. I had planned for this to be an easier race having gone all-out at Abingdon

I do not know which of these factors was the most important. Running a race though is a mental as well as a physical effort, and whereas in my previous marathons I was highly motivated to get a target time, for this one all I wanted was something respectable, and when I found it hard to keep the pace I just let it slip.

I had some other issues. One was that the Garmin got further and further ahead of the mile markers. This is inevitable as one does not take the shortest path; but seemed worse than usual; my final Garmin distance was 26.57 miles. I looked at the Garmin less than usual, for this reason and also because I knew I would not like the pace it showed.

Another was nausea. I took a gel at the start and again at 5 miles, 10 miles and 15 miles. I stopped at the water stations when thirsty which was about 1 in 3 of them. I would normally take another at 20 miles but my body was telling me that if I did, I might vomit. Better, I thought, to keep my stomach settled rather than throw up.

Despite all the above, I loved the race. It was as if I had compartmentalised my brain; one part was thinking about race strategy, while another was just enjoying the experience of running over bridges with jaw-dropping views and through the boroughs of New York City each with their own character, while being cheered constantly by a crowd of New Yorkers.

I had paid a ridiculous $10.00 to have my name on the bib; it was a waste of money because printed so small. However I was wearing my club vest which said ""Winchester Running Club"", and heard constant shouts of encouragement for ""Winchester!"" and also had a few chats with other runners who knew the city or were curious which Winchester it was. One said, ""are you red or blue?"" I was puzzled but then realised he had read the name as ""Manchester"" and was referencing two famous football teams! So I explained.

At around mile 21 I attempted to do some sums to work out what sort of time I could manage. I knew 3:30 was well out of reach but sub-3:45 still seemed possible and I wanted to achieve that. So I put in some effort to keep my pace; most of the variation in those last miles is because of climbs or descents. Going into Central Park was a big boost and I loved the experience of running there. Then you go out onto the street briefly, then back into Central Park for the finish. Waved at my wife who had somehow bagged a great spectator position around 200m from the finish, crossed the line in 3:37:39 which was only a few seconds worse than my time at Abingdon Marathon 2024. If I am reading correctly, it is a good enough time to get me into the NYC marathon next year, should I wish to repeat the experience.

### Post-race
The finish experience was not that great, too much walking and waiting before I was done. You are moved on quickly for obvious reasons; with nearly 60,000 runners it could easily clog up. I picked up a goody bag, the lovely medal, a second finisher medal for AGWC, and a bright orange poncho. Then I was in another line for an AGWC photo, then picked up my dropped bag (very quick), found my wife and headed back to the hotel. 
 
The subway journey though was amazing, so many people sayng ""congratulations"" when they saw the poncho and medal.

The following day we headed out early; the finish area was being dismantled but there was a photo spot for showing off your medal and getting your picture taken (on your own mobile phone) by a volunteer. There was also the marathon pavilion with copies of the New York Times showing all the sub-4 hour finishers plus a few more, medal engraving, and some official finisher shirts and tops. After that we squeezed in a free trip (for medal holders) to the spectacular Top of the Rock at the Rockefeller Center before we had to go to the airport for the flight home.

### Tips and learnings
- Doing two marathons in two weeks is not for everyone. A carefully managed taper followed by the race and then a recovery plan is the right approach if you want the best time and lower injury risk. But if you find, as I do, that you recover quite quickly, then it can be done without disaster.

- The travel and stress of getting to the start line for a major marathon thousands of miles from home is substantial and does not help your health or your pace.

- Regarding the NYC marathon, for those staying in Manhattan the main options for travel to the start are the bus or the ferry. I chose the bus because it goes direct to the start, whereas with the ferry you still need a bus from the ferry terminal to the start. The snag with the bus though is that you have leave really early, before the roads close. With hindsight I wish I had taken the ferry, which would have given me a bit more time in bed and got me to the start later.

- The AGWC is extra cost but has some nice extras; having the tents at the start village was a big bonus despite the overcrowding. I do have reservations though about starting in wave 1. The problem was that many of us would normally be in a later wave, so we were overtaken by faster runners and the pace team was no use. On the plus side, earlier start means earlier finish. The water stations were plentiful but lack of trash bins meant most cups were simply dropped on the ground and became a slip hazard; I am guessing that this gets worse for later waves since the volunteers cannot easily sweep them away.

- The energy and excitement of the NYC marathon is like nothing I have experienced before; it is a great run and worth striving for.

## Why Your Dining Room is BEGGING for a Washable Rug

The dining room is a high-traffic, high-risk zone for your flooring. It's not just a place for elegant dinners; it's a daily hub for breakfasts, homework sessions, coffee spills, and craft projects.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dining%20room%20machine%20washable%20rug)

Here’s why a machine washable option is a game-changer:

*   **Peace of Mind:** This is the biggest selling point. Stop worrying about every little crumb and potential stain. Live in your space, don't just admire it from a distance.
*   **Effortless Hygiene:** Spilled food and drinks can harbor bacteria and attract pests. Being able to wash the entire rug regularly ensures a truly clean and healthy environment for your family.
*   **Budget-Friendly Style:** Traditional rugs are expensive to professionally clean. A washable rug saves you hundreds of dollars a year, allowing you to update your style more often without the guilt.
*   **Durability for Daily Life:** These rugs are built to withstand abuse. They're designed for real life with kids, pets, and clumsy adults (we've all been there).

## What to Look For: The Anatomy of a Perfect Dining Room Machine Washable Rug

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dining%20room%20machine%20washable%20rug)

Not all washable rugs are created equal. When you're shopping, keep these crucial factors in mind to ensure you get one that can handle the dinner-time rush.

### 1. Material Matters

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dining%20room%20machine%20washable%20rug)

The fabric determines the rug's feel, durability, and how well it cleans.

*   **Cotton:** Soft, absorbent, and often gets softer with each wash. A classic, breathable choice. Think of it like your favorite, most reliable t-shirt.
*   **Chenille:** Incredibly soft and plush with a velvety texture. It's surprisingly durable and traps dirt well until wash day.
*   **Polyester / Polypropylene:** This is the workhorse of washable rugs. It's stain-resistant, fade-resistant, and dries very quickly. Many of the most popular brands use a performance polyester blend.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dining%20room%20machine%20washable%20rug)

### 2. Low Pile or Flatweave is Your Friend

**Pile height** refers to the length of the rug fibers. For a dining room, you want a **low-pile** or **flatweave** rug.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dining%20room%20machine%20washable%20rug)

**Why?** Dining chairs need to slide in and out easily. A high-pile, shaggy rug will constantly catch the chair legs, leading to frustration and premature wear on both the rug and your chairs. Low-pile rugs make movement effortless.

### 3. Don't Forget the Non-Slip Backing

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dining%20room%20machine%20washable%20rug)

Safety first! A rug that bunches up under a moving chair is a trip hazard. Look for a rug with a built-in, high-quality non-slip rubber or latex backing. This keeps the rug securely in place, protecting your guests and your floors. Some brands offer a two-piece system with a separate non-slip pad, which also works excellently.

### 4. Get the Size Right

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dining%20room%20machine%20washable%20rug)

A rug that's too small looks awkward and defeats the purpose. Here’s a simple rule of thumb:

> **All legs of your dining chairs should remain on the rug, even when they are pulled out.**

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dining%20room%20machine%20washable%20rug)

To find the right size, measure your dining table and add at least 24-36 inches to each side. This ensures there's enough room for chairs to move comfortably without catching the edge of the rug.

## How to Wash Your Dining Room Rug: The Right Way

Okay, a major spill happened. It's time for a wash. Follow these steps to keep your rug in pristine condition for years to come.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dining%20room%20machine%20washable%20rug)

1.  **Check the Label:** Always start here. The manufacturer knows best. They'll specify water temperature, cycle type, and drying instructions.
2.  **Pretreat Stubborn Stains:** For tough spots like red wine or oil, apply a stain remover (or a mix of vinegar and dish soap) directly to the stain and let it sit for 15-30 minutes before tossing it in the wash.
3.  **Use Cold Water & a Gentle Cycle:** Hot water can shrink natural fibers like cotton and cause colors to fade. A gentle or delicate cycle is your best bet.
4.  **Use Mild Detergent:** Harsh chemicals and bleach are a no-go. They can break down the fibers and ruin the rug's colors.
5.  **Air Dry is Best:** The safest method is to air dry your rug. Lay it flat on a drying rack or over a couple of chairs. If the label says it's safe to tumble dry, use the lowest heat setting possible. High heat can cause shrinkage and damage the backing.

## Styling Your Washable Rug: Function Meets Fabulous

""Practical"" doesn't have to mean ""boring."" A washable rug can be the stunning centerpiece of your dining room.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dining%20room%20machine%20washable%20rug)

*   **Patterns are Your Pal:** A busy pattern (like a geometric, Persian, or abstract design) is fantastic at hiding small stains and everyday dirt between washes.
*   **Consider Darker or Warmer Tones:** While a crisp white rug looks amazing in photos, a charcoal gray, navy blue, or warm terracotta will be much more forgiving in a real-world dining setting.
*   **Layer It Up:** For a textured, high-end look, layer a smaller, more decorative (and potentially non-washable) rug on top of a larger, neutral-colored washable rug. You get the best of both worlds: style and practicality.

## The Final Verdict

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=dining%20room%20machine%20washable%20rug)

Investing in a **dining room machine washable rug** is one of the smartest decisions you can make for your home. It frees you from the anxiety of daily messes, saves you money on professional cleanings, and lets you enjoy a stylish space without compromise.

You can finally have that beautiful, Instagram-worthy dining room that you can also actually *live* in. Now, that's a win-win.

I make no apologies for being who i am, the older i get, i seem to care less about what people think or say these days. I'm more comfortable in my skin than ever before and i know what i like and what i dont like. I'm straight up honest and will say what's on my mind but at the same time, im empathic (sometimes it's a curse, and yes it's contradictory) and wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm prone to over thinking and sometimes worry about the little things in life, because the little things are actually really important. 

**Things that i like:**  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

**Things i dont like:**  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

**My strengths, in no particular order..**

My name’s Hippo, and I’m an alcoholic. Some bits and bobs have been changed to protect the anonymity of our lot.

Our fellowship hall’s currently having a bit of a nightmare with a member nobody wants about. We’re already the hall that other halls send their troublemakers to—you know the one: “There’s a meeting down the road at…” or “You might fit in better over at…” Yeah, we’re THAT hall. Tucked down an alley, next to the working girls and the dodgy bookie’s… I kidd (I make awful jokes—I’m THAT guy).

We really do try to be the best version of ourselves and carry the message to those still suffering, keeping a welcoming space for anyone with the genuine desire—only really giving the boot to the bloke who keeps trying to smoke fent in the bogs. But this one fella, bless him, is a proper handful. He turns up half-cut, constantly gets up and down mid-share, brings in a 4-litre Thermos and fills it several times a day (no idea where it all goes—if anyone necked that much AA coffee, they’d be orbiting Pluto by now). And fair play, that’s annoying but manageable. As they say, the difficult ones are often our teachers—teaching us patience and understanding.

But the real issue, and what’s got everyone’s back up, is that he’s a registered and known sex offender—for crimes against children. Yeah, he was upfront about it, never tried to deny it, and he knows full well he’s not allowed in during the day (all our meetings are open meetings and plenty of members bring their kids) or if any little ones are about.

He’s there because the court’s ordered him to attend, and he reckons he does have the desire to stop drinking. Now, World says we can’t technically bar him just for his record, but if his behaviour or presence keeps causing chaos for the group as a whole, there are things we can do. I’ve kept mostly shtum about it since he rarely turns up to the meetings I chair or the ones I attend. But this week and all of last week, it’s all anyone wants to bang on about—and it usually ends with people shouting over each other. Sadly, we haven’t got a full committee at the moment, so it’s been left to a group conscience and we cant figure out what to do.

1oq18xk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1oq18xk/vivid_dream_of_another_dimension/,Vivid dream of another dimension,"This morning I woke up from a dream that felt dangerously real. In this dream I was a different person, the locals and I did not speak the same language as anything I've ever heard before. My skin tone was different than my current, and in this world technology was more advanced, yet TVs did not exist, music did, but the songs that played spoke in a language that I didn't understand. So the first thing that happened was I woke up in a deep purple hacienda style mansion, lots of intricate designs on the pillars and walls. The interior seemed to be as if it were from the 80s, with a velvet red couch, a mahogany coffee table, I belive I was a teenager, who was taking care of a deathly-sick girl around my age. Her parents had abandoned her when they found out her situation, so she was left in my care, I believe I was a friend of hers, we spoke momentarily and at some point I had left the property to go steal some medicine. The town was small, I used dirt paths to travel, I walked into a metal shack with a basement, as I entered this basement I stumbled upon these stairs that didn't seem to belong, they were glossy-white, with a soft blue light emitting from each individual step, I climbed down through various floors, until I had realized that I broke into someone's home, he grew visibility upset and started to chase me. I had seen these white 'pads' with the same design of the stairs that ran along the walls, and I knew if I climbed those I'd be able to escape, which I did. I found myself running into another building which ended up being some sort of school (?) Being unsure, there were plenty teenagers and children gathered up watching a blue hologram, there was a bin of confiscated toys, being weapons and rifles, some that seemed like they were from this world, and others that were from 'that' world. I snuck a toy into my pants and stole it, who I assume was the teacher was a white bearded man with a muscular build, he had a flamboyant tone in his voice but again everybody spoke a language that I couldn't understand. This electronic cooler sat in the corner of the classroom, and the teacher's assistant offered me a drink which I accepted, the sodas and waters we're in packaging that I've never seen before, the soda cans were beige with blue lettering, the letters were like no language that exists here. I remember what my original goal was (to steal medicine) so after dealing with the assistant I snuck past into the hallway in which the teacher entered. The walls in every building were not drywall, they were some sort of aluminum or hard plastic. I found my way through a series of rooms until I entered what looked like a nurses office, I scoured the drawers and bins looking for a specific medicine and once I did I quickly returned to the classroom without anyone noticing, I calmly walked out and once I was back outside I sprinted home through some shortcuts found in the town. As I was running back to the purple mansion I took in the scenic view of a large city that neighbors the small town, the city was like no other which I've ever seen. Well as soon as I got back home I fed the girl and gave her whatever medication I could, throughout the entire dream she was in her undergarments so when I got back I gave her a large cloth to be covered, afterwards I put on a song and began to do a slow dance, the song was in a different language the same one we spoke, it sounded like traditional jazz, she rose from the couch to dance with me, after some time we stopped and spoke for a while, I didn't understand a word that was said, until things started to slowly grow intimate, nothing NSFW, but it was more of cuddling and kissing, before it could've escalated she told me in a stern voice something that my ears couldn't understand but my mind briefly picked up the language, she stated that she wanted to remain holy on her final days, we remained on the velvet red couch, I was admiring the many paintings, there was a hologram device which I assume was for TV, but I ignored interacting with it. I fell asleep on the couch and as I drifted off into sleep I woke up with lots of confusion. 

What gets to me is that lately for the past couple of days I've been having dreams of people, places, things, that don't exist here in our world.",2,1762441377.0,Dreams,1,1.0,False

Okay, confession time — I used to dread mornings.  
Coffee? Barely helped. Afternoon slump? Guaranteed.  
Then someone in my mom group mentioned the *Fit To Be Pregnant Plan*, and I decided, *why not?*  

Thirty days later, I’m standing here (figuratively, because I now sit less and *live* more) telling you my energy levels *tripled*. No exaggeration — just a new kind of normal where I feel... lit up.

I didn’t expect much. Another plan, another checklist. But this one?  
Let’s just say my expectations got completely replaced by *results*.

Here’s what I noticed:  

- 🌿 **Consistent energy** — No wild spikes or sugar crashes. Just steady fuel all day.  
- 🥑 **Real food that satisfies** — Finally, a plan that doesn’t taste like cardboard dreams.  
- 🧘 **Mind-body balance** — Mindfulness isn’t just a buzzword in this guide. It’s built-in self-kindness.  
- 💪 **Clarity & focus** — I actually enjoy my daily routine now (words I’ve *never* said before).  

And the layout? So easy. No endless constraints. Just a series of small steps that *stack* into real change. Like, “Oh wow, I feel amazing and I didn’t flip my whole life upside down.”  

🔗 Peek at what I used here → [Fit To Be Pregnant Plan](https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/b02053741b)  

After week two, even my partner noticed it — that “something’s different” tone during breakfast.  
By week three, I wasn’t chasing energy. It was chasing *me.*  

Here’s the best part:  
This isn’t just about pregnancies or planning for one (though it’s framed around that).  
It’s about *alignment* — conscious eating, smarter movement, and building habits that make your body say “thank you” every single day.

Bullet-style rundown of my wins:

- More stamina (hello, nesting energy even when I’m not nesting 🪶)  
- Fewer mood swings (sorry, hormones)  
- Glowing skin without filters 😄  
- No guilt when I actually *rested*  

💖 And if you’ve been shopping around for something that feels *worth it*, this one checked all my boxes.

If my story sounds even slightly familiar — drained, checked-out, foggy — this plan might be the small restart you didn’t know you could still choose. Sometimes, transformation doesn’t come with fireworks. It comes disguised as better mornings.

1oq17li,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1oq17li/too_tired_to_sleep/,Too tired to sleep,"Why is it so impossible to get good sleep? I can sometimes get halfway decent sleep (roughly 7 hours a night) for up to a month, but one off night and my sleep gets thrown off for at least a week. It's so hard to get back on track once I have one bad night. The more tired I get the worse my adhd symptoms get which means my brain prioritizes dopamine over sleep. It feels like my entire body is tense and buzzing and just will not relax to get to sleep.

I typically can't nap because I work full-time and have a 2 year old. And if I sleep too much during the day I'm longer tired at night and the cycle continues. It reaches a point my usual tricks don't work and I think like most of us in here I've tried nearly everything to get good sleep.

My usual set up that I've found works 90% of the time is a pregnancy pillow to help with hip and back pain (not currently pregnant, the pillow just works), sound machine on brown noise (fairly loud) and podcast/audiobook in one earbud. I can't get up and do something cause my husband sleeps on the couch due to injury and our 2 year old is in the bedroom with me (in his own bed primarily). I'm also too tired to do anything that's actively relaxing like reading or sudoku puzzles that typically do help with sleep and end up scrolling on my phone which I know is terrible.

I am on vyvanse and it typically wears off around 9 or 10 pm so it's 100% the adhd keeping me up and not the meds.

I just want to sleep and actually feel rested for once. I'm so tired that meds and coffee can't counteract it and the combo of ""no sleep + stimulants"" is skyrocketing my blood pressure. I know as soon as I wake up the day is a complete write off since I'm barely functional, I'm shaking, I'm nauseous, I'm starving and unable to eat at the same time. It becomes another day of just survival and putting off everything I've already been putting off with the only goal being to make it to bedtime and hope sleep will win over the lack of dopamine so I can actually fall asleep before 2am.

G'day Victorians and a Happy Thursday. This is Chris, Narrative Designer, here to tell you about some of the free features in the 1.12 Update. Narrative content will be in future Dev Diaries. In the meantime, from negotiations to exploitative production methods to amendments, it will be wise to read the fine print before using these new devices in your next playthrough. 

Also, we mentioned that modding will be in this diary last week, however Tunay went mad with power and decided to write so much we had to give him his own diary - so stay tuned next week for one on Monday and Thursday!



# Negotiations

Negotiations is a new system in which the player can offer something in exchange for an interest group to support – or at least stop stalling – the current law enactment. It functions essentially as an enactment event on demand, giving players the ability to load the dice and turn enactment in their favour.

[At last a chance to even the odds on difficult law enactments.](https://preview.redd.it/1nenfekmcnzf1.png?width=441&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcce3eee31deb5b57203d567d7a1b9135d2ed300)

To be more explicit, negotiation can do one of the following: 

* Convince a neutral Interest Group to support the law, adding to enactment chance.
   * Note: Interest Groups not in government who support the law do not contribute to enactment chance in Victoria 3. One must move them into the government first. 
* Convinced an opposing Interest Group to stop stalling the law (that is, they become neutral, reducing stall chance). 



Depending on the situation, an Interest Group may be willing to accept favors that may advance their interests, or they may only be willing to change their stance for a very high price, or they may be too skeptical to even negotiate at all. This willingness to negotiate is represented by **Amenability**, a value out of 100. 

Amenability takes into account a wide variety of factors, including modifiers from events and previous negotiations:

[Whom to speak to first is actually a tactical decision, as making lots of promises will lower Amenability until you complete them.](https://preview.redd.it/rn2hd63ucnzf1.png?width=632&format=png&auto=webp&s=dec0572c3272eff063b978f104ca8b3e7a4c0918)

[A popup tooltip on hovering over an IG.](https://preview.redd.it/6jw9dug5dnzf1.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=3737bee6e86f428a7b4a689ecb3efc6241961b4b)

Other Amenability factors include boosts for ruler's popularity, various laws (e.g. secret police gives a boost), and modifiers - especially from having existing promises still outstanding. Interest Groups are also particularly keen to negotiate if they think it will make no difference anyway.  


Based on Amenability, there are four levels of negotiation:

* <25 Amenability: The Interest Group will not negotiate at all. 
* 25-49 Amenability: Negotiations will be difficult. Expect doubled costs and requests.
* 50-74 Amenability: Negotiations will be pragmatic. Standard costs and requests.
* 75-100 Amenability: Negotiations will be collaborative. Halved costs and requests.



Pressing the negotiation button will immediately pop up an Negotiation event of the corresponding level:

[Many options are blatant quid-pro-quo favors.](https://preview.redd.it/oooclfbkenzf1.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8fc10af3cfd2ba38ca9ed7164ee2ad80abb6a7e)

[Bribery is a very strong word, but…](https://preview.redd.it/ka8tlnulenzf1.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9de133ff03e22e84ddb383182efd4e5825aab03)

Let us just say that if an IG somehow inherits a portion of the treasury in the form of non-descript subsidies, contracts and gifts, this will increase their political strength in the future. The public may be less than enthused if some do-gooder reporter were to ever publish the facts. 

Likewise if, by pure coincidence, the Interest Group finds itself suddenly in prominent positions all over the nation's bureaucracy, this will only give them opportunities to expand. Also don't expect them to actually do any bureaucratic labor. Afterall, isn't the point of these couchy government positions, where you can't even be fired, to stick your feet up and relax?

[Working too hard for the government only makes everyone else look bad. Besides, trying to really improve the country… you'd be at it all day! \(I say all this as an ex-public-serviceman myself\).](https://preview.redd.it/5y348geoenzf1.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=48458ab1b1f3c648fe1bee20f87fea5d8cadf00d)

Other than that, there are a variety of promises that can be made to the Interest Group. These will spawn a Journal Entry, with severe consequences for failure.

[Interest Groups will tend to ask for changes that benefit them specifically: For example, the Armed Forces know full well that their own political strength will increase when the nation grows its army.](https://preview.redd.it/66ddmskqenzf1.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=11584c46ed11c268654b91b21bdd87176e7d9b45)

[Always read the fine print.](https://preview.redd.it/9yttwlyrenzf1.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cf4589e9a7afaf04af980c53f92305cb605493f)

The Journal Entry includes buttons to admit the promise was a hoax all along, so we can all come to terms with the state of politics. Players can also announce delays, increasing the timeout for a slight cost to approval. 

Lastly, negotiation is almost entirely powered by script, so modders are free to add more options and tweak balance to their heart's content.



# New Production Methods

On a more serious note: While Victoria 3 has always contained slavery, we previously didn't have any model for the exploitative practices that continued after slavery was banned. Our new plantation production methods, while still by no means perfect, are a step closer to representing the relationship between colonisation and the exploitation of plantation labor post-slavery, and also the violence of slavery itself in the few places it remained. 

Plantations now have a higher mortality rate in general, and generally employ more people. There is differentiation between different plantations, with sugar in particular being the most deadly. This is particularly true to Cuban history during this era, where slaves were expected to be replaced after ten years. 

Slavery will unlock a plantation's Violent Treatment production method, which represents the most brutal practices during the colonial era. Otherwise, if a country has no liberal laws, especially labor laws, the Exploitative Practices production method also boosts production at the expense of the workers standard of living and mortality. 

See below a comparison of the sugar and coffee plantations exploitative production methods, though note, as always, that the final numbers are likely to be tweaked for balance purposes.

[Sugar was infamous as the most deadly plantation crop.](https://preview.redd.it/b7qrxqfwenzf1.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d242932b48118679b5731c5678c198916d4acd3)

[All plantations have access to the new Working Conditions group, though each has different numbers to reflect differences in the crops.](https://preview.redd.it/bvjdjosxenzf1.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=08bb4ec858284da2aedfbbb7edfebdf2bc393065)

https://preview.redd.it/f2d1ecrzenzf1.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=e25491037a153445508d4130de835f4a836ed9b6

[Depending on the area in question, coffee also had a reputation for brutal working conditions.](https://preview.redd.it/dzr8vvv0fnzf1.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=30ca02d5d391b0b2377cf5aa2f777ff601f2567d)

https://preview.redd.it/md277442fnzf1.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=03819b4c22bcbd7747e6632df286843394586711

In general too, plantations tend to employ more people and output more goods. This makes them more construction efficient and advantageous to the weaker economies with lower wages, even when not using the exploitative production methods. This is to model the reasons behind why plantations were placed in the parts in the world with the least wages or workers rights.

These changes to plantations also should shift the economic balance in a way that models the reasons the colonial powers were driven to create colonial administration to oversee the production of valuable cash crops. By putting these colonies under their own charters, instead of using the metropole's laws to the letter, a double-standard system was created where local exploitation could continue even whilst labor reform was underway in European cities. 

In terms of gameplay, this will make more profitable to release colonies as their own subject, or give them to companies to manage through a Colonization Rights charter.The nations with slavery from gamestart, such as Brazil and Cuba, will have a harder time moving away from slavery, and their landowners will feel a more destructive blow to their profits as slavery ends. All in all, this will create more historically accurate simulation. 

There are two major counterbalance points to slavery as well: First of all, the Slave Trade and Legacy Slavery Laws now come with -25%, -10% Influence penalties respectively, representing the diplomatic costs to maintaining these internationally illegal operations. 

Secondly a new Slave Revolt movement has been created. Slaves will now launch full secessions or revolutions. Having a large army will help keep such revolts in check, unless you intentionally want to side with the slave revolt and cause a Haitian style revolution.

https://preview.redd.it/k54mmdp5fnzf1.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfe379ed0d1ec402eb8e36c7faffa4d7aaf4af40

[If a nation loses their overlord's military support or doesn't keep their army up to size, the slave revolt movements can be deadly as more radical slaves join the movement over time.](https://preview.redd.it/lloodu76fnzf1.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=a28e8675e1adc86c10922413665f4f3d7f4b2bd8)

On a happier note, there are also new production methods to represent the manufacturing and technical developments that accompanied Sugar production, which assisted Cuba's eventual banning of slavery in earnest.

https://preview.redd.it/dxa1n349fnzf1.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac75ddbc6914d55a750d6d0e93cb1aa2ee4882be

Likewise, Tobacco has unique Production Methods symbolising not only its manufacture, but its unique revolutionary history. Cuban tobacco workers, rolling cigars from dawn to dusk, had the idea that it might be nice for a person to read to them while they worked. They chipped in their own wages to pay a man to stand at a lector and read to them. Stories sure, but also news. And then, inevitably, workers' news, and the writings of the Cuban Independence movement.

“Yo, Brett, what does your day look like?”

Brett is an old friend. He let me couch surf at his place in Santa Monica back in the 2010’s. The California furniture stores specialize in selling spacious six-foot long couches. Love seats are out as they can’t accommodate the turnstile of transients that California residents take pride in accommodating. If you don’t have someone living on your couch in California, you are considered a yuppie with no heart. The only ones that sleep on leather love seats are in Malibu homes and are strung out half-celebrities, itching for a fix of fame. A couple lines or a couple lines as an extra or some cameo moments in a TV show and there they are scrunching into a modern designed half-couch overlooking the ocean while wallowing in self-pity. At Brett’s apartment, I am stretched out in full form and covered in a hand crocheted blanket. The windows open, the air floats in and cools his place. The bong is only feet from my face where I load it with some fine California Kush.

Brett and I are old now and bong rips have passed us by. He asks if I want to have him roll a joint up for our meeting, but I am clear headed now, being watched by lawyers and regretfully decline. What can we do to remember the times in the shrieking daylight of Las Vegas. He meets me in the Ride Share zone of the Palazzo. He has grown old and has a trimmed salt and pepper beard. His glasses have grown thicker, but he has that same raspy voice. It looks like he has been eating good. We are far and away from scrounging cigarettes and eating cheap tacos on the beach. We used to skateboard, get high and watch Cheech and Chong movies. I am sure we could slide back into that paradigm in no time and walk away with a few more injuries after some exercise. We hit the strip and recant on memories that have been burned away as we have been focused on magnifying our lives in real time while getting ahead and making something of ourselves in today’s world. He is a designer and utilizes the computer and his natural born artistic talent to create fantastic images that are strung from the rafters in convention halls and posted on the signage at all the Las Vegas trade shows. We boast about receiving purple hearts for surviving our youth. It was a doozy to say the least. All I know is we are here now, flailing our hands wildly in our reminiscing and trucking along anonymously amongst the crowds. We poke about and are watching tourists fill two-foot-long alcoholic beverage glasses. There are want to-be show girls propositioning illegal aliens for pictures with their feathered outfits that spew cheap polyester fuzz which is floating away in the wind that carries dreams. This is the real Las Vegas, where the difference between the have and have-nots is as thin as a dime or a lucky bet.  

“Let’s go check out The Juliette inside the Venetian.” I interrupt our thought stream from yesteryear.

“Sure.” He replies.

The Venetian is a maze and after gawking at the ceilings that look like the sky and painted with clouds, we grab the scent of the Casino, the smoke from cigarettes. Plaster replicas of Italian architecture are posted everywhere, and we are meandering through, along and past the canals where gondolas full of tourists get pushed along while the light murmur of the hordes pause their yacking to point and shoot pictures. The real gondola ride in the real Venice is quiet and you can hear the drops of water drip off the oar as you glide between the tightly packed buildings. This is nothing like that place. We enter the casino and are on the far side of where I see The Juliette sign pronounced dimly through the gleam and glare.

I don’t want to spend any time here, I just want my bearings and see where I will find my babe on the stroll. I am also looking for a place where a creeping pimp could hide and watch us while we toss a couple back. I don’t want to get lost in the purposeful misdirection that casino designers revel in on my way to the trot later tonight. The last thing I need is a hooker to think I am standing her up when I need her so desperately to rub my back, kiss my neck and whisper sweet nothings in my ear. There is a thick, green velvet rope blocking off the entrance as The Juliette is now closed and bartenders are preparing for the approaching evening. I glance in and it is reminiscent of a library with lots of shelving but instead of books, backlit liquor bottles are stacked in rows that reach up to a vaulted ceiling. There is a lengthy and wide granite bar. This will be the place where I begin my encounter.

Brett and I walk back to the Ride Share zone where he is picked up and he heads home. He lives on the strip, and I receive a text within ten minutes that he has rolled a joint, sparked it and teases me that I cannot get high at this time. A great time with a great friend. My legs and groin are tired and sore from so much walking, and I question how my performance will be when the night shades are drawn within my abode. I grab another coffee from the java zone.

Text Bubble – “Sup?” A message sent to Isabella.

Isabella’s Text Bubble – “Hi, how is your day?”

What a sweet girl, asking me how my day is. Really? Just take a shower bitch.

Text Bubble – “Where do you want to meet?” I ask to see if she has a desired zone.

Isabella’s Text Bubble – “You tell me.”

Isabellas’s Text Bubble – “We can meet at AFT Patio Deck Bar in the Wynn.”

Text Bubble – “Is it outside? It is kind of cold out.”

Isabella’s Text Bubble – “It is, but I think they have heaters.”

Text Bubble- “Let’s meet at The Juliette in the Venetian Casino at six-thirty p.m.”

She affirms my choice with a thumbs up and a heart emoji.

1oq14gr,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oq14gr/filthy_love/,Filthy Love,"**St. Louis – Missouri – 1858**

Saloon Holy Colt had a busy night that day. The old sheriff, together with a chevron-mustached shoemaker and a hairless blacksmith’s boy, gambled drunk-mad at the poker table. Couples clung to each other over tables a foot too narrow, lit by flickering candles. Two rowdy cowboys fought over a seat at the back, repeatedly throwing one another off.

And Lady Evelyn sat at the bar, alone.

She had donned her finest Bouffant dress with seductive red silk, frayed only at the bottom of her skirt, cooling her face by flapping a hand fan, its illustration stained by dried coffee. Her head jerked around like a meerkat’s, unable to settle on any one thing.

Nobody had granted her company for almost an hour—only the bespeckled bartender when he had asked what drink she wanted.

The thought of just going home tempted her; a night reading Northanger Abby again sounded swell; better than stewing in the last of her cheap perfume, when the saloon doors swung open. The men at the front window singing ‘Oh! Susanna’ paused, causing a baker’s dozen of heads to perk up.

In came a snipper-snapper dressed like an English noble, his black frock coat buttoned all the way where a ruffle bush bulged out the top, his trousers straight and dust-free. He wore no hat, waves of ink falling below his chin, and his face was a canvas for shadows, seeping into the sharp lines of his cheeks.

Glowers and snickers he earned before everyone returned to their business, except for the sheriff. He had gotten a tic to wanderingly flick his gaze across the man as his skinny likeness faltered toward the bar.

Evelyn spied him, too, through corner-twisted eyes—such a strange man, moving as if any step could land on dynamite, more high-strung than a broken horse. Stranger still, he took a seat right next to her, wordlessly, climbing on with the wobbliness of a child, his neck hidden in his shoulders.

More interested was he in the moose trophy above the bottle rack or the bartender pacing back and forth cleaning a glass than the beautiful dame he had occupied.

“My, that’s quite bold of you, sir,” Evelyn said.

The man turned to her, his eyes open all the way; they were pale blue. “Excuse me?” And his voice was soft yet salient, like a sea breeze.

“You sittin’ there.”

“I’m sorry, have I committed a faux pas?”

“Don’t you know?” After Evelyn’s rise in pitch, he answered by shaking his head, so she explained to him, “When you sit next to a lonely lady, you must buy her a drink.”

“Oh, I did not know.”

“Yes, and you should keep her company for the evening. A lady must go home smiling, mustn’t she?”

She hummed a high note behind flat-pressed lips.

“Well… well…” With a sharp breath, his posture snapped straight as if the air had inflated his spine. “Let’s get on that, then, non?”

A vibrancy wholly unlike before radiated from him while he waved the bartender over. He ordered a glass of champagne for the lady, his voice pronounced, not held back, and paid with a generous tip on top. He seemed like a different man now.

“My. Flaunting, are we?” Evelyn teased.

“Cornelius,” he said as he put away his purse.

“Evelyn.”

“Nice to meet you, Madame Evelyn.”

“Madam?” she sneered. At the same time, the bartender placed a wine glass before her, to which she expressed a customary thank you. “You don’t hear that ’round these parts. What, are you French, *monsieur*?”

“No, but I studied abroad for a while. It’s just that their words are such a joy to employ.”

The social smile on Evelyn’s face, meant to look pretty but unassuming, stretched into a genuine one.

“Not for poetry, right?” she said, her cheeks stuffed with mirth.

Cornelius, in turn, chuckled while swinging his head backward like he had taken a punch to his ego. When he returned, his eyes were shy about meeting hers, darting between the drink being poured and Evelyn’s skirt.

“No. Right. It was for medicine. Medical chemistry specifically.”

“You must know a lot about what’s in my body then,” she mused as she picked up her glass, not looking at it. “Or what’s in this drink?” After toasting the air, she took a swig, her nose disappearing behind the rim of the glass.

“Nothing good, turns out, but we knew that already, didn’t we?”

When Evelyn lowered her glass, her whole face crumpled in on itself, biting back the bitter poison she had just swallowed. “What, the drink or my body?—oof, that was a nasty one.”

“Too harsh?” he asked.

“Too disgusting.” She scowled nastily at the concoction before casting her full attention on him. In the saloon’s warm, orange glow, her gaze had all the shine of a painter marveling at the next masterpiece a canvas would hold.

“If you’ve interest in better wines, I, well, I have a whole stash of them lying in my mansion,” he stuttered.

Evelyn’s brows danced a salsa across her forehead, the word, “Mansion!?” stumbling out of her with the grace of a donkey.

“Yes…” Cornelius cringed backward. “I need somewhere to live.”

“But a mansion?”

“It was up for sale,” he said, shrugging. “I’m still putting everything in place, but I was wondering… if you feel inclined…” In the meantime, his fingers nervously sparred with one another. “To share a drink there.”

Now, Evelyn recoiled, taking back the space she had leaned into. “I don’t know, stranger.” Her arms crossed as she turned to the bar again, pulling at the neckline of her dress.

“No, of course. Forget I asked.”

“So, do you travel a lot?” she asked, leaving no time for awkward silences.

Cornelius wobbled his head before replying, “From time to time, if work demands it.”

“Not one to settle down, then.”

“Maybe. Some day.” Aping her posture, Cornelius faced the bar and rested his arms on its countertop, but with a wider, more manly demeanor. “I’d need to find a woman who’d let me.”

“Let you?” Evelyn scoffed, the rich trill behind her words returned.

A corner of Cornelius’s mouth nudged against his cheek. “In my experience, women tend to avoid—”

While she was lost exploring his ghostly eyes, her hand had been nudging her glass onto its tip, but ventured too far, causing it to fall over. The champagne splashed over the counter, and Cornelius, in a loud, scrambling flurry, flew out of his seat, knocking the chair away. He buckled from a step, nearly tripping over, before he stood limbs-spread two feet from the bar.

Evelyn, barely able to follow the chaos, saw a blur of limbs and then Cornelius standing there, exposed, frozen like a frightened deer.

In a burst, she laughed, the hilarity clenching her stomach so hard that she had to bend over, the phrase, “What was that?” leaving her in skittish bounces. As she cackled like a macaw, he got a rose tint to his cheeks, which prolonged her giggle fit even more.

“I am quite a germaphobe,” he muttered, straightening himself and rejoining her with a stiff back. “I don’t like to get myself dirty.”

“So you—so you—” Evelyn couldn’t get the words out, too rocked by her own memory of the event. “So you shoot away like some—” She snorted and wheezed and peeped, becoming as red as he was. “Like some jackra—” And her sentences broke off into a cougar’s growl followed by more laughter.

Cornelius merely watched—waited for the storm of joy to take its course tickling her silly, patiently smiling back at this glowing bundle of life. Her fit dissolved in due time, leaving her face pleasantly irritated.

“You’re a real sissy, you know that?” she said after a calming sigh.

“I’ve been called worse,” he replied.

With an eyebrow cocked, Evelyn checked him up and down, his gaunt physique, his fancy attire, his scarred chutzpah, and she could only see in that a harmless lad too afraid to hurt a fly. Compared to the men thundering like lions across the saloon, he was a peaceful acacia wishing to offer her some shade. And his eyes looked so innocent, so hopeful.

“Do you know what, French boy?” she said softly, turning her body to him once more. “Tomorrow at noon, maybe I’ll visit that mansion of yours to lessen the load of wine.”

Instead of beaming with delight, Cornelius allowed his expression to rest on an ever so slight simper, and he told her candidly, “At the end of Russel Boulevard. You can’t miss it.”

“I’m holding you to your word. It better be an amazing wine.”

“The best.”

They continued to talk for a while, forgetting about the busyness of the saloon and sharing tales from each other’s young lives until the hour grew too late and Evelyn excused herself. Cornelius watched her leave through the swinging doors, seeing her offer one last smile and a wave of the fingers before she was gone. After a few minutes, he also left.

The sheriff was not watching him anymore.

—

Evelyn gasped under her umbrella at the sight of the mansion, a massive white block with enough room for a tower, a fenced porch, several chimneys, and too many windows to count, sitting splendidly atop a grassy hill. She wore a green, homely dress, puffy at the shoulders.

Coming to the front door, it opened the moment she stepped onto the porch, Cornelius poised in the opening like a soldier, wearing a white blouse and a black vest.

“Good day, madame,” he greeted her warmly.

“There is that madam again,” she replied, walking inside past him. “I’d prefer you just call me by my name.”

He closed the door. “Very well. It’s good to see you, Evelyn. The sun makes you even more beautiful.”

“Thank you.”

After taking, closing, and putting away her umbrella in a rack, he slinked into a nearby room.

“Make yourself at home. I’ll get the wine ready.”

Cornelius wasn’t lying; the mansion did indeed need further decoration. Its foyer was a barren street of wood, a carpet-less staircase leading to the second floor, and the adjacent rooms were lucky to have a chair or a couch in them.

“You don’t have to right away,” Evelyn said. Wandering with feet and eyes, she came across a strange door built into the side of the staircase.

“Nonsense, it’s what you came here for.”

“Well…” While trying the handle—and finding it locked—she whispered to herself, “Not just that.”

Through the foyer and to the right was Cornelius in the kitchen, hunched over a batch of wine bottles. He glanced over his shoulder, perked up, and said, “Go, go sit in the living room. I’ll be there in a minute.”

Answering with a nod, Evelyn spun on her heels and found, at the other side of the house, a snugly decorated living room. Like an Indian between priests, it starkly contrasted against the neighboring spaces, showing vibrant gayness in its leather skin couch, cushioned chairs, dark wood table, and luxurious drapes.

“Oh my, looks like you’ve had time to at least pretty one up,” she said.

Stepping into it felt like entering her family’s home, being inside of a familiar, warm bubble, and she was able to sit comfortably on the wing­back’s pillow.

“I couldn’t have invited you to a desert,” Cornelius shouted back from the kitchen. “Although I would’ve finished the rest if I weren’t such a yack at organizing.”

“We all have our faults.”

“Very much true.”

Amidst his words came a loud pop of the cork pried from its bottle, at which point Evelyn was scouring the wall and spotted a beautiful painting of spring meadows hanging above the hearth. Its frame had been carved to excruciating detail, swirls within crests, and vice versa.

Feeling an itch in her wrist, she discreetly scratched it under her sleeve. “Tell me, how does a medicine man earn enough to buy all this?”

“Are you asking after my job?”

“Maybe.”

Glasses clinked in the kitchen, followed by something heavy being dragged over, then rusty hinges creaking. “I used to work as a coroner.” More sounds of ticking glass rolled past, but far smaller and shier this time.

“I didn’t know that paid well.”

“Depends on how many bodies need to be examined.”

“Did you see a lot, then, and wherever were you before?” she asked.

There was a moment of pause, the kitchen having gone completely quiet. From where she sat, Evelyn could only see a closed cupboard and a chair, but nothing of Cornelius. Right when she had the thought to call out for him, his voice rounded the corner.

“Iowa, and yes.”

“Were they… horrific?”

“Could be. The coyotes there had a nasty appetite. Saw more than a couple corpses with massive chunks missing.”

“My goodness,” Evelyn gasped.

“Don’t worry, they won’t come here.”

Another moment of silence went by, and she became aware of how long ago the bottle of wine had been opened. It couldn’t take that much time to pour out two glasses.

“Do you need help?” she shouted.

“No-no-no,” Cornelius rattled off. “I’m done. I’m done. No need for you to get up for nothing.”

He said that, but it still took him about ten awkward seconds to emerge from the kitchen holding two glasses of wine, so generously filled that it would have the French arching a puzzling brow at it.

“My, you don’t intend to make me a blue blotter, do you?” she said, letting out a nervous chuckle.

“You may drink as much as you like,” he replied before placing the glass in his right hand close to her on the table. The other he held onto as he took his place on the couch. “I won’t be offended if you leave any.”

With one hand resting on her knee, Evelyn leaned over, grabbed the drink, smelled it—the scent was plum sweet—and took an explorative first sip. It was thick with sweetness, almost overpowering its acidic bite of alcohol, washing her tongue under a wave of cherry delight.

“Mmmm—” she hummed with a mouthful, then swallowed. “That’s really good.”

“Didn’t I tell you?” Cornelius was helpless against grinning.

At that moment, Evelyn noted how his expression seemed more muted than last night. In fact, his whole body was less animated, almost shrinking in on itself. He looked closer to how he was when entering the bar than when he first talked to her.

However, she barely got to think about it before he distracted her with a tale of when he worked at a monastery overseas, in a town near Lac du Salagou.

He used a lot of French words, making it hard for her to follow, but she happily watched him talk nonetheless, enchanted by the gleam in his eyes and the performance his hands played. Cornelius was so excited, almost in love, with his time there and the people he met and the things he learned. For a brief moment, he was back to the way she liked him.

Twice at every tale, Evelyn sipped from her wine, and more, and more, after each gulp feeling her eyelids grow heavier, the room become balmier, and Cornelius’s voice fade further away.

When her head rested against the chair, hearing him say a nonsensical French phrase, she had the thought of how sensitive this man was—an unhardened babe—and that the rough cowboys of St. Louis would chew him out.

Evelyn wanted to protect him from that, and upon deciding this in her head, she fell into unconsciousness.

—

The sensation of musty air was the first thing Evelyn felt when she awoke, climbing out of a viscous sludge pulling at the seams of her mind. Her throat burned, her body was numb—no perception in her arms or legs—and a sharp sting bore into the edges of her mouth.

Opening her eyes was like prying off a scab, the dull light of a stone floor akin to staring straight into the sun.

Jumbled fragments came to her—the surrounding state of things—that she was in a dark room, that she was lying on her side, that she was in pain, that this was a cellar, that a lantern cast down a sparse glow, hanging from a hook in the ceiling, that there was a large box several feet in front of her.

That, before this, she was drinking with Cornelius.

Evelyn tried to conjure her voice and let out a grunt, but not only did her throat convulse in excruciating pain, but a cloth was tied over her mouth, fastened extremely tight and digging into the corners of her lips. When she yelled ‘Help!’ with all of her power, it arrived in the form of a weak, pathetic moan.

Then a heavy weight clunked behind her before a door creaked open, followed by footsteps descending a wooden staircase. Evelyn remained still, tracking the person’s sounds until it passed her by, and she could see what it was.

A pair of brogue shoes made their way across the cellar. They didn’t slow when going around her, heading straight for the box, and as they widened the distance, they revealed clean pants, a white blouse, and a head of wavy black hair.

Her heart sank when she realized it was Cornelius, a sense of determination in him she hadn’t seen before, indifferent to her lying there helplessly on the ground.

Standing before the box, he leaned over to do something, making clicks happen as if clasps were undone. Then he grabbed the edge of its top and slid the large plank off, gently laying it down. Dust danced in the air as if celebrating being free. Going onto his knees, Cornelius whispered things and swayed his head as if he were talking to another person inside.

Dread collapsed in on her, and Evelyn tried to push herself up, tried to crawl away to her own freedom, but her body didn’t listen. Nothing apart from her eyes and a few muscles in her neck could move, and the despair and anguish from knowing this, grasping that she was utterly helpless, caused her to let out a grunt.

Cornelius snapped his head around. He looked at her with shock stretching his face, frozen for a horrified second.

“No-no-no,” he rambled as he hurried over, collapsing next to her head before peeling her eyelids further open. “Oh, I thought I had it wrong. God damn it! I’m so sorry.”

He rose, glancing across the cellar in a mad hurry. “I’m sorry. This is my fault, I’m so sorry.” On the other side of the room, he found a table and rushed to it, continuing to apologize even if she hadn’t replied at all.

A strange weight was pushing on her mind, eating away at the thoughts she needed in order to understand this situation, a haze hiding away the world.

“This shouldn’t have happened. It should’ve been peaceful for you.”

But she didn’t need clarity to feel the fear when, over by the box, she saw a figure start to emerge from it. Red and long, bony claws crawled over the edge, scratching the oak surface. Blood drenched their keratin forms, trickling off and leaving a vibrant trail. However that set of appendages was connected, it managed to brace against the box’s side, making it groan as more of the figure emerged. A slender, inhumanly stretched arm rose into the open, arched in a spike upward, beginning to drag out a grotesque red thing.

The smell of iron overwhelmed the air.

“Don’t look,” Cornelius called out before he flung himself in front of Evelyn, blocking her view of the *thing*. She was trying to writhe away, scream for help, but all she actually did was cry into the gag, her eyes wildly shifting. “I… I’m so sorry. This is my fault.” To his side, she noticed that he was holding a knife, and when he realized she had seen it, Cornelius hid it behind his back and said, “I swear, this is not the way it’s supposed to go.”

During a brief lapse in composure, he twisted toward the far end of the room, where the box and that *thing* were. It turned his chest so that Evelyn could see a sliver as well.

The figure had crawled halfway out, its overgrown arms splayed forward to steady itself, massive, clawed hands scratching at the ground. As if baptized by the devil, blood cascaded down its sunken torso in endless droves, coating its burned, glowing skin, making it look sickeningly red. The head was a glossy, bald globe, keeping whatever kind of face such a monstrosity could have tucked away.

Evelyn’s heart drummed so hard against her ribcage she felt the pressure squeeze her skull, and finally, she let out a sound she had meant to make, a desperate, frightened wail.

“I said, don’t look. You don’t have to look.” Cornelius quickly put himself between them again, casting Evelyn in shadow. He stared down at her with a pained expression, cringing at the words he failed to give her. “I… I’m sorry.”

While tears cascaded from her eyes, he set the knife down and grabbed her by the shoulders.

“Here,” he said before turning her over, her lower body not following all the way due to the paralysis. “Close your eyes, it’ll be over soon.”

Next, he picked up the knife, making that slick noise, and Evelyn knew what it meant. With every ounce of strength she could muster, she tried to flail and fight back, but even after willing beyond any perceivable limit, she only managed to twitch her head in place as if she had a shiver.

“I’m truly sorry,” Cornelius whispered to her ear. Finally, he wrapped his hand around her mouth, turned her head up, and drew the knife across her neck in one smooth slice.

Instantly, a wave of cold washed over Evelyn, cutting her off from the sensations in her own body, feeling only the icy prick of needles gradually melt into a numbing heat. Her lungs couldn’t breathe, the muscles in her neck convulsed on their own, but for her, it was like she was drowning in cotton pillows, an ignorant bliss.

It masked Cornelius’ words as the murmurs of an angel. “Close your eyes. It’ll be over soon. Just sleep. Just sleep.”

He was cradling Evelyn’s head, gently brushing her hair as he watched for the life to leave her eyes, blood pouring from the cut in her neck. It pooled on the stone floor, expanding outward, and when it almost touched his pants, Cornelius moved his leg out of the way.

“You’ve done great. You’re a kind person, and the gates will open for you, I can guarantee that,” he whispered, stroking her head one more time. “None of this is your fault; it’s entirely mine.”

Evelyn heard none of it. The bells were calling to her, on their way to usher her spirit through the garden of jasmines, and she had accepted it would happen. But before the world faded completely into white, she caught a glimpse of the wicked *thing* as it crawled around them.

Its eyes were gold dots amidst a mire of black, evil incarnate according to everything known, yet they stared at her with—if Evelyn’s waning mind wasn’t deceiving her—pity.

Then she went slack, and Evelyn was no more.

Cornelius gently placed the body’s head down and muttered, “I’m sorry” one last time in a defeated tone. Motionless, he sat there beside the corpse on his knees, lost in his own remorse. The knife lay on the floor, unbloodied.

Like a cautious spider, the red *thing* crept closer to the fresh mound of flesh, still full of succulent skin and supple muscle. It grazed one of its distended hands along the face, running sharp claws over the cheek, but careful not to puncture yet. An eager hum rumbled in its arched throat, and the *thing* turned to Cornelius, rocking in anticipation.

He finally looked over at it.

But… it? No, that’s not how he saw her. This was his beloved, she who waited on him while her maw of adorable needle teeth watered, hunched on her slender limbs, savoring the meaty scent through her nose slits. He felt awful for his error, but he shouldn’t let that wound her.

“Go ahead… eat,” he said.

His crimson darling puffed, expelling the thrill that flooded her, before she opened her lipless mouth, unhinging it as far apart as an anglerfish could, and snapped its rows of spear teeth into the carcass’ side. She tore out a large chunk, ripping cloth and flesh like lettuce, and snapped a piece of bone off with a loud crack. Blood ran down its jaws, neck, then torso as she tilted her head up to jerk her meal down without chewing.

In her eagerness, she caused a scrap of the dress to catch in her throat, making her gag and knocking Cornelius out of his sulk. He crawled over to her on hands and knees to start stroking her bony back.

“Don’t eat so fast, chew it first,” he said. “Here, wait.”

When he raised his hand to her mouth, she opened it all the way, far beyond humanly possible, and let him reach in to pull out the obstructing piece. He had to feel around, prod, and nudge along the inside of her slick throat, and it made her twitch, the needle teeth shivering around his shoulder. Yet, not for a single second did he think himself in danger. Not with her.

His arm reemerged covered in blood and viscous slobber, holding a clump of slimy cloth.

“You’re unbelievable,” he muttered as she returned to gulping her food down.

Over the next half hour, Cornelius sat with his beloved, caressing her beautifully slender arm, rubbing the hard protrusions in her skin, and ogling her with pure adoration as she bit off chunk after chunk. When he lectured her to chew properly for the third time, she finally listened and slowed her devouring frenzy, and when she purred in delight at the taste of the young woman’s thigh, he called her adorable and hugged her.

At some point, Cornelius becoming somewhat touch-starved, he wrapped his arms around her contorted torso and pressed his entire body against her blood-drenched skin. She let it happen, not bothered in the slightest, even if his hug made it harder for her to hunch over and tear a rib out.

After the last bite, having shredded Evelyn’s body into unrecognizable scraps, she curled up and huddled into Cornelius’s embrace, a satisfied song rumbling in her belly.

“I love you,” he said before he placed a kiss upon her hairless temple.

In turn, she hummed like a dove, scratching a button of his filthy blouse using her long, bloodied claw.",2,1762441096.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

We even vacationed together a couple of times. Four years ago Sarah and her husband moved 4 hours away to be closer to her mother who was having some medical issues. Since that time we have offered to visit, to sit with her mother (who we knew) so they could gave some free time, to meet halfway for dinner, etc. We’ve even offered for them to come stay (mom included) at our house for a long holiday weekend. We do text and have the occasional phone chat once every week or two. Sometimes they initiate the conversation, sometimes we do. They are never able to meet up however, even when we have offered to make the 4 hour trip to go them. Every time I think maybe they no longer want to continue the friendship, my sister or I will get a phone call about how much they miss us  and they wish they had time to meet up with us. BTW, we’ve also offered to bring dinner or cook dinner at their house. Sarah had a favorite store when she lived near us. Imagine my surprise yesterday when I walked into that store (15 minutes from my house) and she was there. I was so happy to see her. We chatted for a while and I asked her if she wanted to get a coffee or come back to my house. She came over and stayed about 2 hours. I was so happy. Later that night I was suddenly sad that she came 4 hours to her favorite store and didn’t even tell any of us that she was coming.

I am hosting a friend at my house in a very popular city. My friend used to live here and so still has many other friends in the area.

They are staying for 9 days (which, to be blunt, saves them a ton of money as hotels are expensive). But they are constantly gone, first for an overnight trip, then returning late every night, and apparently tomorrow they will be staying overnight in a nearby town and coming back the night of the following day. 

My friend did bring some little treats as a thank you(think coffee and sweets), but we have probably spent a grand total of 40 minutes or so together. Just earlier they say at the table scrolling through their phone, without trying to chat or anything. 

I am not someone who insists on company constantly (as a giant introvert), but am feeling used.

I was also gone for a couple nights due to my job, but communicated everything clearly. 

If I stay somewhere, I would offer to buy (or make) my hosts dinner as a thank you, and that seems extremely unlikely in the current situation.

1oq11t4,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1oq11t4/hr_filthy_love/,[HR] Filthy Love,"**St. Louis – Missouri – 1858**

Saloon Holy Colt had a busy night that day. The old sheriff, together with a chevron-mustached shoemaker and a hairless blacksmith’s boy, gambled drunk-mad at the poker table. Couples clung to each other over tables a foot too narrow, lit by flickering candles. Two rowdy cowboys fought over a seat at the back, repeatedly throwing one another off.

And Lady Evelyn sat at the bar, alone.

She had donned her finest Bouffant dress with seductive red silk, frayed only at the bottom of her skirt, cooling her face by flapping a hand fan, its illustration stained by dried coffee. Her head jerked around like a meerkat’s, unable to settle on any one thing.

Nobody had granted her company for almost an hour—only the bespeckled bartender when he had asked what drink she wanted.

The thought of just going home tempted her; a night reading Northanger Abby again sounded swell; better than stewing in the last of her cheap perfume, when the saloon doors swung open. The men at the front window singing ‘Oh! Susanna’ paused, causing a baker’s dozen of heads to perk up.

In came a snipper-snapper dressed like an English noble, his black frock coat buttoned all the way where a ruffle bush bulged out the top, his trousers straight and dust-free. He wore no hat, waves of ink falling below his chin, and his face was a canvas for shadows, seeping into the sharp lines of his cheeks.

Glowers and snickers he earned before everyone returned to their business, except for the sheriff. He had gotten a tic to wanderingly flick his gaze across the man as his skinny likeness faltered toward the bar.

Evelyn spied him, too, through corner-twisted eyes—such a strange man, moving as if any step could land on dynamite, more high-strung than a broken horse. Stranger still, he took a seat right next to her, wordlessly, climbing on with the wobbliness of a child, his neck hidden in his shoulders.

More interested was he in the moose trophy above the bottle rack or the bartender pacing back and forth cleaning a glass than the beautiful dame he had occupied.

“My, that’s quite bold of you, sir,” Evelyn said.

The man turned to her, his eyes open all the way; they were pale blue. “Excuse me?” And his voice was soft yet salient, like a sea breeze.

“You sittin’ there.”

“I’m sorry, have I committed a faux pas?”

“Don’t you know?” After Evelyn’s rise in pitch, he answered by shaking his head, so she explained to him, “When you sit next to a lonely lady, you must buy her a drink.”

“Oh, I did not know.”

“Yes, and you should keep her company for the evening. A lady must go home smiling, mustn’t she?”

She hummed a high note behind flat-pressed lips.

“Well… well…” With a sharp breath, his posture snapped straight as if the air had inflated his spine. “Let’s get on that, then, non?”

A vibrancy wholly unlike before radiated from him while he waved the bartender over. He ordered a glass of champagne for the lady, his voice pronounced, not held back, and paid with a generous tip on top. He seemed like a different man now.

“My. Flaunting, are we?” Evelyn teased.

“Cornelius,” he said as he put away his purse.

“Evelyn.”

“Nice to meet you, Madame Evelyn.”

“Madam?” she sneered. At the same time, the bartender placed a wine glass before her, to which she expressed a customary thank you. “You don’t hear that ’round these parts. What, are you French, *monsieur*?”

“No, but I studied abroad for a while. It’s just that their words are such a joy to employ.”

The social smile on Evelyn’s face, meant to look pretty but unassuming, stretched into a genuine one.

“Not for poetry, right?” she said, her cheeks stuffed with mirth.

Cornelius, in turn, chuckled while swinging his head backward like he had taken a punch to his ego. When he returned, his eyes were shy about meeting hers, darting between the drink being poured and Evelyn’s skirt.

“No. Right. It was for medicine. Medical chemistry specifically.”

“You must know a lot about what’s in my body then,” she mused as she picked up her glass, not looking at it. “Or what’s in this drink?” After toasting the air, she took a swig, her nose disappearing behind the rim of the glass.

“Nothing good, turns out, but we knew that already, didn’t we?”

When Evelyn lowered her glass, her whole face crumpled in on itself, biting back the bitter poison she had just swallowed. “What, the drink or my body?—oof, that was a nasty one.”

“Too harsh?” he asked.

“Too disgusting.” She scowled nastily at the concoction before casting her full attention on him. In the saloon’s warm, orange glow, her gaze had all the shine of a painter marveling at the next masterpiece a canvas would hold.

“If you’ve interest in better wines, I, well, I have a whole stash of them lying in my mansion,” he stuttered.

Evelyn’s brows danced a salsa across her forehead, the word, “Mansion!?” stumbling out of her with the grace of a donkey.

“Yes…” Cornelius cringed backward. “I need somewhere to live.”

“But a mansion?”

“It was up for sale,” he said, shrugging. “I’m still putting everything in place, but I was wondering… if you feel inclined…” In the meantime, his fingers nervously sparred with one another. “To share a drink there.”

Now, Evelyn recoiled, taking back the space she had leaned into. “I don’t know, stranger.” Her arms crossed as she turned to the bar again, pulling at the neckline of her dress.

“No, of course. Forget I asked.”

“So, do you travel a lot?” she asked, leaving no time for awkward silences.

Cornelius wobbled his head before replying, “From time to time, if work demands it.”

“Not one to settle down, then.”

“Maybe. Some day.” Aping her posture, Cornelius faced the bar and rested his arms on its countertop, but with a wider, more manly demeanor. “I’d need to find a woman who’d let me.”

“Let you?” Evelyn scoffed, the rich trill behind her words returned.

A corner of Cornelius’s mouth nudged against his cheek. “In my experience, women tend to avoid—”

While she was lost exploring his ghostly eyes, her hand had been nudging her glass onto its tip, but ventured too far, causing it to fall over. The champagne splashed over the counter, and Cornelius, in a loud, scrambling flurry, flew out of his seat, knocking the chair away. He buckled from a step, nearly tripping over, before he stood limbs-spread two feet from the bar.

Evelyn, barely able to follow the chaos, saw a blur of limbs and then Cornelius standing there, exposed, frozen like a frightened deer.

In a burst, she laughed, the hilarity clenching her stomach so hard that she had to bend over, the phrase, “What was that?” leaving her in skittish bounces. As she cackled like a macaw, he got a rose tint to his cheeks, which prolonged her giggle fit even more.

“I am quite a germaphobe,” he muttered, straightening himself and rejoining her with a stiff back. “I don’t like to get myself dirty.”

“So you—so you—” Evelyn couldn’t get the words out, too rocked by her own memory of the event. “So you shoot away like some—” She snorted and wheezed and peeped, becoming as red as he was. “Like some jackra—” And her sentences broke off into a cougar’s growl followed by more laughter.

Cornelius merely watched—waited for the storm of joy to take its course tickling her silly, patiently smiling back at this glowing bundle of life. Her fit dissolved in due time, leaving her face pleasantly irritated.

“You’re a real sissy, you know that?” she said after a calming sigh.

“I’ve been called worse,” he replied.

With an eyebrow cocked, Evelyn checked him up and down, his gaunt physique, his fancy attire, his scarred chutzpah, and she could only see in that a harmless lad too afraid to hurt a fly. Compared to the men thundering like lions across the saloon, he was a peaceful acacia wishing to offer her some shade. And his eyes looked so innocent, so hopeful.

“Do you know what, French boy?” she said softly, turning her body to him once more. “Tomorrow at noon, maybe I’ll visit that mansion of yours to lessen the load of wine.”

Instead of beaming with delight, Cornelius allowed his expression to rest on an ever so slight simper, and he told her candidly, “At the end of Russel Boulevard. You can’t miss it.”

“I’m holding you to your word. It better be an amazing wine.”

“The best.”

They continued to talk for a while, forgetting about the busyness of the saloon and sharing tales from each other’s young lives until the hour grew too late and Evelyn excused herself. Cornelius watched her leave through the swinging doors, seeing her offer one last smile and a wave of the fingers before she was gone. After a few minutes, he also left.

The sheriff was not watching him anymore.

—

Evelyn gasped under her umbrella at the sight of the mansion, a massive white block with enough room for a tower, a fenced porch, several chimneys, and too many windows to count, sitting splendidly atop a grassy hill. She wore a green, homely dress, puffy at the shoulders.

Coming to the front door, it opened the moment she stepped onto the porch, Cornelius poised in the opening like a soldier, wearing a white blouse and a black vest.

“Good day, madame,” he greeted her warmly.

“There is that madam again,” she replied, walking inside past him. “I’d prefer you just call me by my name.”

He closed the door. “Very well. It’s good to see you, Evelyn. The sun makes you even more beautiful.”

“Thank you.”

After taking, closing, and putting away her umbrella in a rack, he slinked into a nearby room.

“Make yourself at home. I’ll get the wine ready.”

Cornelius wasn’t lying; the mansion did indeed need further decoration. Its foyer was a barren street of wood, a carpet-less staircase leading to the second floor, and the adjacent rooms were lucky to have a chair or a couch in them.

“You don’t have to right away,” Evelyn said. Wandering with feet and eyes, she came across a strange door built into the side of the staircase.

“Nonsense, it’s what you came here for.”

“Well…” While trying the handle—and finding it locked—she whispered to herself, “Not just that.”

Through the foyer and to the right was Cornelius in the kitchen, hunched over a batch of wine bottles. He glanced over his shoulder, perked up, and said, “Go, go sit in the living room. I’ll be there in a minute.”

Answering with a nod, Evelyn spun on her heels and found, at the other side of the house, a snugly decorated living room. Like an Indian between priests, it starkly contrasted against the neighboring spaces, showing vibrant gayness in its leather skin couch, cushioned chairs, dark wood table, and luxurious drapes.

“Oh my, looks like you’ve had time to at least pretty one up,” she said.

Stepping into it felt like entering her family’s home, being inside of a familiar, warm bubble, and she was able to sit comfortably on the wing­back’s pillow.

“I couldn’t have invited you to a desert,” Cornelius shouted back from the kitchen. “Although I would’ve finished the rest if I weren’t such a yack at organizing.”

“We all have our faults.”

“Very much true.”

Amidst his words came a loud pop of the cork pried from its bottle, at which point Evelyn was scouring the wall and spotted a beautiful painting of spring meadows hanging above the hearth. Its frame had been carved to excruciating detail, swirls within crests, and vice versa.

Feeling an itch in her wrist, she discreetly scratched it under her sleeve. “Tell me, how does a medicine man earn enough to buy all this?”

“Are you asking after my job?”

“Maybe.”

Glasses clinked in the kitchen, followed by something heavy being dragged over, then rusty hinges creaking. “I used to work as a coroner.” More sounds of ticking glass rolled past, but far smaller and shier this time.

“I didn’t know that paid well.”

“Depends on how many bodies need to be examined.”

“Did you see a lot, then, and wherever were you before?” she asked.

There was a moment of pause, the kitchen having gone completely quiet. From where she sat, Evelyn could only see a closed cupboard and a chair, but nothing of Cornelius. Right when she had the thought to call out for him, his voice rounded the corner.

“Iowa, and yes.”

“Were they… horrific?”

“Could be. The coyotes there had a nasty appetite. Saw more than a couple corpses with massive chunks missing.”

“My goodness,” Evelyn gasped.

“Don’t worry, they won’t come here.”

Another moment of silence went by, and she became aware of how long ago the bottle of wine had been opened. It couldn’t take that much time to pour out two glasses.

“Do you need help?” she shouted.

“No-no-no,” Cornelius rattled off. “I’m done. I’m done. No need for you to get up for nothing.”

He said that, but it still took him about ten awkward seconds to emerge from the kitchen holding two glasses of wine, so generously filled that it would have the French arching a puzzling brow at it.

“My, you don’t intend to make me a blue blotter, do you?” she said, letting out a nervous chuckle.

“You may drink as much as you like,” he replied before placing the glass in his right hand close to her on the table. The other he held onto as he took his place on the couch. “I won’t be offended if you leave any.”

With one hand resting on her knee, Evelyn leaned over, grabbed the drink, smelled it—the scent was plum sweet—and took an explorative first sip. It was thick with sweetness, almost overpowering its acidic bite of alcohol, washing her tongue under a wave of cherry delight.

“Mmmm—” she hummed with a mouthful, then swallowed. “That’s really good.”

“Didn’t I tell you?” Cornelius was helpless against grinning.

At that moment, Evelyn noted how his expression seemed more muted than last night. In fact, his whole body was less animated, almost shrinking in on itself. He looked closer to how he was when entering the bar than when he first talked to her.

However, she barely got to think about it before he distracted her with a tale of when he worked at a monastery overseas, in a town near Lac du Salagou.

He used a lot of French words, making it hard for her to follow, but she happily watched him talk nonetheless, enchanted by the gleam in his eyes and the performance his hands played. Cornelius was so excited, almost in love, with his time there and the people he met and the things he learned. For a brief moment, he was back to the way she liked him.

Twice at every tale, Evelyn sipped from her wine, and more, and more, after each gulp feeling her eyelids grow heavier, the room become balmier, and Cornelius’s voice fade further away.

When her head rested against the chair, hearing him say a nonsensical French phrase, she had the thought of how sensitive this man was—an unhardened babe—and that the rough cowboys of St. Louis would chew him out.

Evelyn wanted to protect him from that, and upon deciding this in her head, she fell into unconsciousness.

—

The sensation of musty air was the first thing Evelyn felt when she awoke, climbing out of a viscous sludge pulling at the seams of her mind. Her throat burned, her body was numb—no perception in her arms or legs—and a sharp sting bore into the edges of her mouth.

Opening her eyes was like prying off a scab, the dull light of a stone floor akin to staring straight into the sun.

Jumbled fragments came to her—the surrounding state of things—that she was in a dark room, that she was lying on her side, that she was in pain, that this was a cellar, that a lantern cast down a sparse glow, hanging from a hook in the ceiling, that there was a large box several feet in front of her.

That, before this, she was drinking with Cornelius.

Evelyn tried to conjure her voice and let out a grunt, but not only did her throat convulse in excruciating pain, but a cloth was tied over her mouth, fastened extremely tight and digging into the corners of her lips. When she yelled ‘Help!’ with all of her power, it arrived in the form of a weak, pathetic moan.

Then a heavy weight clunked behind her before a door creaked open, followed by footsteps descending a wooden staircase. Evelyn remained still, tracking the person’s sounds until it passed her by, and she could see what it was.

A pair of brogue shoes made their way across the cellar. They didn’t slow when going around her, heading straight for the box, and as they widened the distance, they revealed clean pants, a white blouse, and a head of wavy black hair.

Her heart sank when she realized it was Cornelius, a sense of determination in him she hadn’t seen before, indifferent to her lying there helplessly on the ground.

Standing before the box, he leaned over to do something, making clicks happen as if clasps were undone. Then he grabbed the edge of its top and slid the large plank off, gently laying it down. Dust danced in the air as if celebrating being free. Going onto his knees, Cornelius whispered things and swayed his head as if he were talking to another person inside.

Dread collapsed in on her, and Evelyn tried to push herself up, tried to crawl away to her own freedom, but her body didn’t listen. Nothing apart from her eyes and a few muscles in her neck could move, and the despair and anguish from knowing this, grasping that she was utterly helpless, caused her to let out a grunt.

Cornelius snapped his head around. He looked at her with shock stretching his face, frozen for a horrified second.

“No-no-no,” he rambled as he hurried over, collapsing next to her head before peeling her eyelids further open. “Oh, I thought I had it wrong. God damn it! I’m so sorry.”

He rose, glancing across the cellar in a mad hurry. “I’m sorry. This is my fault, I’m so sorry.” On the other side of the room, he found a table and rushed to it, continuing to apologize even if she hadn’t replied at all.

A strange weight was pushing on her mind, eating away at the thoughts she needed in order to understand this situation, a haze hiding away the world.

“This shouldn’t have happened. It should’ve been peaceful for you.”

But she didn’t need clarity to feel the fear when, over by the box, she saw a figure start to emerge from it. Red and long, bony claws crawled over the edge, scratching the oak surface. Blood drenched their keratin forms, trickling off and leaving a vibrant trail. However that set of appendages was connected, it managed to brace against the box’s side, making it groan as more of the figure emerged. A slender, inhumanly stretched arm rose into the open, arched in a spike upward, beginning to drag out a grotesque red thing.

The smell of iron overwhelmed the air.

“Don’t look,” Cornelius called out before he flung himself in front of Evelyn, blocking her view of the *thing*. She was trying to writhe away, scream for help, but all she actually did was cry into the gag, her eyes wildly shifting. “I… I’m so sorry. This is my fault.” To his side, she noticed that he was holding a knife, and when he realized she had seen it, Cornelius hid it behind his back and said, “I swear, this is not the way it’s supposed to go.”

During a brief lapse in composure, he twisted toward the far end of the room, where the box and that *thing* were. It turned his chest so that Evelyn could see a sliver as well.

The figure had crawled halfway out, its overgrown arms splayed forward to steady itself, massive, clawed hands scratching at the ground. As if baptized by the devil, blood cascaded down its sunken torso in endless droves, coating its burned, glowing skin, making it look sickeningly red. The head was a glossy, bald globe, keeping whatever kind of face such a monstrosity could have tucked away.

Evelyn’s heart drummed so hard against her ribcage she felt the pressure squeeze her skull, and finally, she let out a sound she had meant to make, a desperate, frightened wail.

“I said, don’t look. You don’t have to look.” Cornelius quickly put himself between them again, casting Evelyn in shadow. He stared down at her with a pained expression, cringing at the words he failed to give her. “I… I’m sorry.”

While tears cascaded from her eyes, he set the knife down and grabbed her by the shoulders.

“Here,” he said before turning her over, her lower body not following all the way due to the paralysis. “Close your eyes, it’ll be over soon.”

Next, he picked up the knife, making that slick noise, and Evelyn knew what it meant. With every ounce of strength she could muster, she tried to flail and fight back, but even after willing beyond any perceivable limit, she only managed to twitch her head in place as if she had a shiver.

“I’m truly sorry,” Cornelius whispered to her ear. Finally, he wrapped his hand around her mouth, turned her head up, and drew the knife across her neck in one smooth slice.

Instantly, a wave of cold washed over Evelyn, cutting her off from the sensations in her own body, feeling only the icy prick of needles gradually melt into a numbing heat. Her lungs couldn’t breathe, the muscles in her neck convulsed on their own, but for her, it was like she was drowning in cotton pillows, an ignorant bliss.

It masked Cornelius’ words as the murmurs of an angel. “Close your eyes. It’ll be over soon. Just sleep. Just sleep.”

He was cradling Evelyn’s head, gently brushing her hair as he watched for the life to leave her eyes, blood pouring from the cut in her neck. It pooled on the stone floor, expanding outward, and when it almost touched his pants, Cornelius moved his leg out of the way.

“You’ve done great. You’re a kind person, and the gates will open for you, I can guarantee that,” he whispered, stroking her head one more time. “None of this is your fault; it’s entirely mine.”

Evelyn heard none of it. The bells were calling to her, on their way to usher her spirit through the garden of jasmines, and she had accepted it would happen. But before the world faded completely into white, she caught a glimpse of the wicked *thing* as it crawled around them.

Its eyes were gold dots amidst a mire of black, evil incarnate according to everything known, yet they stared at her with—if Evelyn’s waning mind wasn’t deceiving her—pity.

Then she went slack, and Evelyn was no more.

Cornelius gently placed the body’s head down and muttered, “I’m sorry” one last time in a defeated tone. Motionless, he sat there beside the corpse on his knees, lost in his own remorse. The knife lay on the floor, unbloodied.

Like a cautious spider, the red *thing* crept closer to the fresh mound of flesh, still full of succulent skin and supple muscle. It grazed one of its distended hands along the face, running sharp claws over the cheek, but careful not to puncture yet. An eager hum rumbled in its arched throat, and the *thing* turned to Cornelius, rocking in anticipation.

He finally looked over at it.

But… it? No, that’s not how he saw her. This was his beloved, she who waited on him while her maw of adorable needle teeth watered, hunched on her slender limbs, savoring the meaty scent through her nose slits. He felt awful for his error, but he shouldn’t let that wound her.

“Go ahead… eat,” he said.

His crimson darling puffed, expelling the thrill that flooded her, before she opened her lipless mouth, unhinging it as far apart as an anglerfish could, and snapped its rows of spear teeth into the carcass’ side. She tore out a large chunk, ripping cloth and flesh like lettuce, and snapped a piece of bone off with a loud crack. Blood ran down its jaws, neck, then torso as she tilted her head up to jerk her meal down without chewing.

In her eagerness, she caused a scrap of the dress to catch in her throat, making her gag and knocking Cornelius out of his sulk. He crawled over to her on hands and knees to start stroking her bony back.

“Don’t eat so fast, chew it first,” he said. “Here, wait.”

When he raised his hand to her mouth, she opened it all the way, far beyond humanly possible, and let him reach in to pull out the obstructing piece. He had to feel around, prod, and nudge along the inside of her slick throat, and it made her twitch, the needle teeth shivering around his shoulder. Yet, not for a single second did he think himself in danger. Not with her.

His arm reemerged covered in blood and viscous slobber, holding a clump of slimy cloth.

“You’re unbelievable,” he muttered as she returned to gulping her food down.

Over the next half hour, Cornelius sat with his beloved, caressing her beautifully slender arm, rubbing the hard protrusions in her skin, and ogling her with pure adoration as she bit off chunk after chunk. When he lectured her to chew properly for the third time, she finally listened and slowed her devouring frenzy, and when she purred in delight at the taste of the young woman’s thigh, he called her adorable and hugged her.

At some point, Cornelius becoming somewhat touch-starved, he wrapped his arms around her contorted torso and pressed his entire body against her blood-drenched skin. She let it happen, not bothered in the slightest, even if his hug made it harder for her to hunch over and tear a rib out.

After the last bite, having shredded Evelyn’s body into unrecognizable scraps, she curled up and huddled into Cornelius’s embrace, a satisfied song rumbling in her belly.

“I love you,” he said before he placed a kiss upon her hairless temple.

In turn, she hummed like a dove, scratching a button of his filthy blouse using her long, bloodied claw.",1,1762440922.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1oq11j0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandalsResorts/comments/1oq11j0/sandals_grenada_food_review_from_a_nondrinking/,Sandals Grenada Food Review from a Non-Drinking Vegan,"Hi Friends! Thought I would give a quick food review of my stay at Sandals Grenada as a Vegan who doesn't drink. Hoping this might be helpful for anyone that's in the same boat.  For context, my husband and I are strict vegans, haven't drank in a very long time, booked a butler sweet, and it was our first time at Sandals. I sent over notice to Sandals beforehand letting them know of our dietary restrictions. 

Food & Alcohol - the big deal.   
One of the big reasons that we decided to get Butler service was to help navigate our food. Since it was our first time and we did last minute booking, the rate was reasonable for the Butler Suite. The butlers were aware upon our arrival and had stocked our room with NA drinks (Diet Sodas, Juices, Coffee, Tea, & NA champayne). The made special trips to get my husband NA beer and Ginger Beer for myself.  Mocktails from the bar aplenty. The bartenders were very kind and often made super fun drinks. We did receive drinks with alcohol in them twice, but I thought that wasn't too bad. You could smell the rum in them before tasting. There was hiccups with food nearly daily. We hated the waste that this caused. We had sushi delivered with fish in it, pizza with cheese, vegan wraps with mayo, dairy instead of non-dairy coffee creamer, etc. So just be mindful of checking your food, especially if it's delivered to you.

Breakfast Buffet - Oatmeal, Toast, Potatoes, Beans, Juice, Fruit. Everyday. 

All resturants have at least one vegan option on the menu, which is great! But that doesn't mean that it's the same standard as the other meals. The first night we ate at Spices and the meal was delicious, but so small we got room service after. The next day we had our Butler guide us on how to use the culinary desk to request custom Vegan meals for each resturant. Don't think that you're being extra doing this. The great thing about this option is that you get the custom 3 course meal AND you can order any other vegan items off the menu. The only resturant that messed up the Vegan custom order was Soy. They put a mayo based sauce in everything. We just left there and went to the Tipsy Turtle for a plant based burger. Soy had the most issues, which was surprising bc we were ordering literally the Veggie roll that's on the menu. Neptunes blew everyone out of the water. We ate there quite a few times. The Chef made us Surf & Turf, Farro, Pasta, Vegetable Pie, insanely delicious food. Kimonos was also delicious. The Chef cooked our food before he started the other hibachi and they had tofu! Most resturants were decent and if you wanted to do the same custom meal experience for lunch you could. The little cafe also had vegan sweet treats, you just need to request them. Are they amazing? No. Do they hit the spot? Sometimes. 

To close, below is a list of each resturant, what we ate, and how we would rate it.   
Neptunes: 10/10 - Vegetable Pie, Surf & Turf, Italian Pasta, Falafal, Farro  
Kimonos: 7/10 - Fried Rice, Tofu & Noodles, Miso Soup, & Hibachi Veggies  
Tipsy Turtle: 6/10 - Burgers & Fries, Corn Chowder  
Butch's - 4/10 - Meatloafish Patty in tomato sauce, Portabello Mushrooms (additional request), Simple Salad, Banana Foster  
Spices - 5/10 - Curry, Breakfast Buffet   
Cucina Romana - 8/10 - Meaty Pasta, Beet Polenta, Best Dessert, Breakfast Buffet  
Dino's Pizzeria - 7/10 - Cheeseless Veggie Pizzas drizzled with a variety of infused oils  
Le Jardinier - 4/10 - French Lentil Pie, Potato Wedges, Roasted Pears  
Soy - 2/10 - Veggie Sushi Roll, Edameme  


Would I book again? Already have. Best advice is to get friendly with the culinary desk. They were so helpful. I feel like we wouldn't have gotten half of the lunch meals without our butlers helping us. We enjoyed ourselves. ",5,1762440904.0,SandalsResorts,7,0.73,False

Full story:

Our standard coffeemaker finally bit the dust. Since it had been on its last legs for some time, I already knew that I wanted to get a Moccamaster as a replacement, in the hopes that I would never need to get another coffeemaker.

We used a Zojirushi carafe (primed with hot water from the kettle) with our old coffeemaker, so I opted for the thermal carafe version.

Prior to brewing our first pot, I primed the thermal carafe with hot water for about 30 minutes.
While the first cup was great, every subsequent cup was significantly cooler. 

When my husband commented that the coffee didn’t stay hot enough, I decided to check it. I filled the thermal carafe with water from the kettle, then took the temperature with my digital thermometer. I then checked it several times. Over the course of an hour and 45 minutes, the temperature dropped from 199.9F to 170F.

I reached out to Moccamaster directly, and they told me to run a water-only cycle and see if the outside got hot. Result: a bit warm, but not hot. 

I teated the thermal carafe again, as well as our trusty Zojirushi. The Moccamaster thermal carafe again dropped by nearly 30 degrees, while the Zojirushi only dropped by 16.5 degrees.

I followed up with Moccamaster with my receipt and a request for a replacement carafe. Moccamaster’s response was to check that the bottom was tight (it was), and per the Repair Technician,  those temperature readings are as expected. 


Did all of the glowing reviews on r/Moccamster, r/BIFL, and r/coffee give me unrealistic expectations? I’m seriously disappointed in a purchase that I made with the understanding that the high price was justified by the quality of the product. 

So, r/Moccamaster, convince me to keep it. What would you do in this situation?

Edit to add: yes, the lid was swapped out. 

Also, when I was testing the temperatures, it was with the boiling water that I added from the kettle. The coffeemaker doesn’t make coffee at 200F to start, so the 30 degree drop is from an initial comfortable-to-drink temperature in less than 2 hours.",0,1762440700.0,Moccamaster,7,0.5,False

Day to day, I work as an attorney and am even running for office. I am a normal person. A good person even. I am hoping that someone here can help me figure out where the music is coming from.

I woke up precisely at 7:55 like I have every morning I can remember. I haven’t needed it since I turned 13, but I always set an alarm just in case. Reaching for my phone to turn it off, I remembered the dream I was having. A green park in a small town square out of a picture book. Surrounded by an old crimson brick wall that somehow looked as new as if it had been built yesterday. And a polite white bench.

I know I have never been to this park. I doubt anyone has been to a park like that since the 1950s. But I’ve had recurring dreams of it—first when I started my senior year of high school and now again since Bree started my campaign. But it still feels deeply familiar. Like a park that I might have visited when I was a young boy.

This time, though, something was subtly different. More the impression of the dream than the experience. The trees in the park were still tall, but they were ominous—not lofty. The brick wall was still solid, but it was impenetrable—not sturdy. And remembering the dream now, I think it ended differently this time. I can’t remember how, but there was something new. A presence that woke me up with a sense of overwhelm instead of peace.

When I picked up my phone, I had already missed several texts from Bree. One a perfunctory good morning, “Hey, little brother! Big day today! Proud of you!” Then a handful laying out my schedule for the day. Work at the office from 9 to 5. Then at the campaign headquarters from 5 to 9. I know that my days will grow longer as the election approaches. For now, working the schedule of a normal lawyer seems easy.

I put my feet down on his apartment’s cold wooden floor and walked to the television hanging opposite my bed. I turned it on just as the theme song for the local morning news started.

Somehow, Dotty is still hosting. She may look like a Great Value Miss America anymore, but she is still holding on. Even if her permed blonde hair seems to be permanently strangling her gray roots.

“Good morning, Mason County!,” she rasped in an effortful echo of her younger voice. “It’s another sunny day! Even if the clouds disagree.” I let some air out of my nose. Dotty’s jokes have not gotten better with age. “Today’s top story: the race for Mason County’s seat in the state legislature. Young hometown attorney Mikey is running to unseat 12-term incumbent Senator Pruce whose office was recently the subject of an ethics investigation that has since been closed at the governor’s order.”

Bree’s publicist has done a good job. I barely recognize myself in the photograph. When I look in the mirror, I see a too tired and too skinny nerd whose hair is too black to be brown and too brown to be black. On the TV, the glasses I am always anxious about keeping clean actually make me look smart. Especially next to my wrinkly plum of an opponent. I don’t hate Pruce, but he was certainly made for the world before Instagram.

“The latest polling shows Pruce with a substantial lead thanks largely to the district’s heavy partisan tilt. Mikey’s campaign, led admirably by his sister Bree, is under-resourced but earnest. And his themes of bipartisanship, town-and-gown partnership, and clean government along with the campaign’s mastery of social media seem to be appealing to younger voters.” I can’t disagree with the narrative there. With only a fraction of our parents’ promised funds having come through, Bree has done a lot with a little.

Still listening to Dotty’s monologue about the job losses threatened by federal cuts to Mason County Community College’s budget, I showered and shaved. I put on my Monday coat and tie while the frumpled weatherman tried to make a week of clouds sound pleasant. When I grabbed the remote to turn off the TV, Dotty teased, “Remember to join us this Friday night for the first and only debate between Mikey and Senator Pruce. The world–or at least our studio–will be watching.” At exactly 8:50 am, I grabbed my coffee and opened the door.

Walking out to find my door being watched impatiently by Rosa the cleaner, I paused for just a moment. I reminded myself that I am happy. I graduated from an Ivy League school. I opened my own law office. I am running for office. And my parents, according to their Facebook posts, are proud of me.

Using the mindfulness techniques that my therapists have taught me, I brought myself back to the present. I turned to Rosa and gave her a pleasant smile. “Buenos días, Rosa!,” I recited in perfect Spanish. “Gracias por limpiar mi lugar y todos tu arduo trabajo.” Every person is a potential voter.

Looking into the mop water on Rosa’s cart, I found myself thrust back into memory of this morning’s dream. I remembered that I was stirred by the strange feeling of drowning in something other than water. Something thin and gauzy. Then I remembered the sight that I saw right before opening my eyes. The material I was drowning in was bright, almost neon pink—somewhere between Pepto-Bismol and that hard bubblegum I used to get at church. I know the park dream happens when I am stressed, but this hot pink funeral shroud was something new.

I caught myself. It was time to work. Once I got to the office, I worked on pleasantly mundane tasks: drafting a complaint, reviewing a deposition transcript, checking the mail. I even found something to like about billing hours. I am fortunate. Unlike most of my law school classmates, I actually like being a lawyer.

Or I did. As I brought in more and more work, my family had started to help me. My mother emails to make sure I am keeping at a healthy weight. My father has Bree check in to make sure I am making enough money. When Bree started to plan the campaign, she started to advise me on which clients and cases I should take. Of course, none of these suggestions are optional.

With 4:00 pm approaching, I prepared for a meeting with a potential client. Since I am one of the very few attorneys in town—perhaps the only one without a drinking problem—I never know what kind of client or case these meetings are going to bring. At precisely 4:00 pm, I opened the door to see a round man with a look like he was meeting an old friend.

I welcomed him in and listened to his story. The man explained that he had just been released from the Mason County Correctional Facility. Apparently, this was supposed to be a civil rights case. The man described the conditions in the prison. I wished I could be surprised at the routine violations of basic laws and human rights. I can’t be. I grew up hearing the same stories from some of my extended family—third cousins and the like. This was the kind of case I had become a lawyer to take. But I knew I couldn’t take this one. I can’t look anti-cop with the election just two weeks away.

“So that’s my story,” the man concluded.

“I understand,” I lied kindly. “Thank you for sharing with me.” I meant that part.

“Do you think you can help me, Mr. Mikey?”

“I’m not sure. Let me step out and call my associate.”

I left the cramped conference room that used to be a kitchen. Pulling up my recents to call Bree, I realized I have been using a creative definition of “associate” over the past few months.

Bree answered efficiently. “Hey! Are you on the way?”

“Not quite. I’m wrapping up a meeting with a potential client.”

“Is this another soft-on-crime case?”

“It’s not soft on crime. It’s…,” I began to protest.

“No. Absolutely not.” The law had spoken. “You know we can’t take those cases this close to the election. You’re running to make the change that will keep those cases from happening in the first place. You can’t let your feelings make you sacrifice your future.” I wondered why Bree said that “we” couldn’t take the case.

“Yeah. You’re right. I’ll see you soon.”

As I opened the door to tell the man the news, the man’s phone rang. I knew I remembered that song. Slow. Sweet. I knew it was a lullaby, but I couldn’t place it.

*If you’re not feeling happy today,*

*Just put on a smiling face.*

*It will make the pain go away*

*Before you forget to say…*

Remembering those lyrics, I felt seen. And watched.

“So, what’s the verdict?,” the man hoped out loud.

“I’m sorry, sir. The firm just can’t take on a case like yours at the moment. If you’d like, I can refer you to some other attorneys.”

“No thanks. I’ll take this as my answer.”

I flinched at that then continued the script.

“Well, thank you for coming in. It’s always a pleasure to meet someone from our town.”

Waiting for me to open the door, the man mumbled genuinely, “Sure. Thanks for your time. I’m still going to vote for you.”

I went to close the door behind the man but couldn’t stop myself from asking. “Excuse me. Sir?” The man turned around halfway down the brick walkway. “I love your ringtone. What song is that? I know I heard it when I was a kid, but I can’t remember the name.”

The man looked at me like I had just asked if his prison cell had been on Jupiter. “I think it’s called Marimba or something. It’s just the default.”

I gave the man a kind nod. Closing the door behind him, I tried to shake off the feeling that came over me when I heard that song. It made me feel uncomfortably aware of the man’s eyes on me when I braced to deliver the bad news. It was like the man was suddenly joined by an invisible audience that waited for me to say the lines I had rehearsed so many times. The song reminded me of something always waiting just out of sight—waiting to swallow me whole if I ever failed to act my part.

I walked back to my desk, shut my laptop, and grabbed my blazer on the way out the door. In the past, I might have stayed late to work on cases. Not this year.

Driving through town, I passed the old bookstore where I spent hours on afternoons when my parents were working and Bree was building her resume with one extracurricular or another. The owner, Mrs. Brown, had always made me feel at home. I’m not sure if it was because of her failing memory or because she saw just what I needed, but Mrs. Brown always left me alone. I cherished that time alone with Mrs. Brown where I could breathe without someone’s eyes waiting for me to do something wrong. Something that the kids at school would make fun of and my family would try to fix. In Mrs. Brown’s store, I could just *be*.

By the time memory had taken me to junior year when Mrs. Brown’s store was run out of the market by internet sales, I had arrived at my campaign office. That is probably not the right word. It is more the building that my campaign office is in. The building that was the town civic center some decades ago. Now it’s been converted into a rarely-used venue for weddings and receptions and overflow offices for some of the mayor’s staff. One of these town employees is the daughter of one of Bree’s favorite professors, and he convinced her to let Bree borrow it after city work hours.

Walking from the car to the double dark-paneled wooden doors, I appreciated that the mayor who had ordered the renovation had at least thought to preserve the building’s frame. It has been there longer than anyone still alive in the aging county.

Bree was waiting just inside the dust-odored lobby when I opened the doors. Before either of us said anything, Bree gave me a flash of a smile. We always have this moment. Before we start talking about the campaign or our careers or what we can do better, Bree looks at me like a proud big sister happy to see her little brother. I remember this smile from our childhood, but it became fainter and rarer as Bree aged and took on more responsibilities. Ever since our father informed us that Bree would be running my campaign, the smile has only come in these flashes.

“Hey. Good day at work?” Bree asked perfunctorily. I love her for trying.

“Normal,” I said, following Bree down the side hallway to the cramped office. “So I can’t complain.”

“I’m glad,” Bree answered. I wasn’t sure if she was glad I had a good day or glad I was not complaining. Probably both.

We sat down in the professor’s daughter’s town-issued pleather chairs, and Bree commenced.

“Thank you for coming this evening.” She runs these meetings like she is reading a profit and loss statement in a Fortune 500 conference room. Sometimes I wonder if she rather would be. “The polling is still not optimal. We’re trailing 45 to 50 with 8 percent undecided. The latest social campaign went well. The A-B testing found that the voters prefer you in a red tie so we’ll stick with that going forward.”

Tired of fighting it, Bree pushed her a runaway wisp of black hair out of her face with a red headband. I smiled to myself thinking about Bree doing that as a girl. She has always been too serious to bother with her hair.

“Anti-corruption is still your strongest issue. People seem to like that coming from someone young and idealistic. The question is whether it will be enough to get people to the polls when Pruce has the culture war on his side.”

I nodded at the right time. I wanted to pay attention. Bree worked hard to prepare this report, but it is hard to focus when I know my opinions don’t matter. Bree makes the decisions for the campaign, and the polls make the decisions for Bree. I hate myself for being so cynical, but I am a politician now. I am just the smiling face on the well-oiled machine.

When Bree started to explain the campaign schedule up through Friday’s debate, I heard something familiar. It sounded like a woman humming in the room next door. Except, in the office at the end of the narrow hallway, there was no room next door. I decided I wasn’t hearing anything.

Bree dictated, “Tomorrow, we have a meeting with Scarnes and Blumph, your publicists.”

*If you’re not feeling happy today…*

The wordless music continued, now coming from both the room that wasn’t next door and behind the professor’s daughter’s desk.

My decision failed me. I was definitely hearing something. I told myself maybe it was an old toy in one of the cardboard boxes that towered in the corner opposite me. I looked up at Bree to see if she heard anything. She reported on without a moment’s hesitation.

“Then on Wednesday we have the meet and greet at the nature center.”

Moving my head as little as possible, I began to dart my eyes around the room. The music was coming from above me now. I thought there might have been an attic there before the renovation.

*Just put on a smiling face…*

I tried my best to look focused. I am always trying my best.

“On Thursday, we have your appearance for seniors at the YMCA.”

I fought to keep breathing, but the air was leaving me. The music, now all around me and getting louder, was almost suffocating. I was drowning in it.

*It’ll make the pain go away…*

My nerves began to demand my body move. First my fingers began to tap the chair’s worn arm. The music grew louder. Then my feet joined in. The music was nearly deafening.

At that, Bree looked up from her papers. For another fleeting moment, she looked at me like a sibling instead of a campaign manager. But this time it was a look of concern instead of affection.

“You good?” Bree’s question was almost drowned out by the song.

“Yeah, yeah. I’m fine. Probably just too much coffee.” I felt like I was shouting, but I know I was using my inside voice.

Almost as scared of Bree’s disappointment as the music from the void, I asked, “Do you hear something?”

The music stopped except for the faint hum from the woman in the room that wasn’t next door.

*Before you forget to say…*

“No.” Bree’s face looked just as I had feared. Worried but not willing to show it.

Silence kindly returned.

With an earnest attempt at earnestness, I pivoted. “And the debate’s Friday?”

“Right…” Bree said as if she were asking herself for permission to continue. “But I’ll do the walkthrough of the venue on Thursday.”

Bree haltingly continued to the financial section of her report, and I remembered. She used to sing the song to me before bed. It is called “Put on a Smiling Face,” and it is from *Sunnyside Square*. I think it was my favorite show as a kid.

I couldn't ask Bree about it. Not with the way she looked at me. But, after I left her office, I texted a few friends. No one remembers it. Does anyone here? The show aired in Mason County in the 90s, and the lullaby was its theme song. I don’t remember anything else right now.

by ForeverPi

The air outside the *Federation Officer Training Center* had that crisp tang of early morning fog, thick and wet as it rolled in from the Bay. Recruits were already up and moving—jogging in synchronized lines, the rhythmic thud of boots mixing with the echoing cadence calls. San Francisco shimmered in the distance, a rare break in the clouds letting sunlight touch the tops of the Golden Gate’s twin spires.

Ensign Recruit Dunnigan jogged past the parade grounds, caught halfway between exhaustion and focus. The call had come over the barracks intercom just after sunrise:

>“Recruit Dunnigan. Report to the front office immediately.”

No one ever wanted that call.

When he stepped into the office, the smell of burnt coffee hit first—then the sight of *Drill Sergeant Rink*, hunched over his desk like a stone carved from the word “disapproval.” His uniform was sharp enough to slice through hull plating, every line of fabric in perfect military alignment. Rink didn’t look up. He rarely did.

Dunnigan stood at attention. He didn’t blink. Didn’t swallow. Didn’t breathe too loud.

Minutes passed.

Finally, Rink’s eyes flicked up from the screen.  
“At ease. Congratulations. Sign here.”

Dunnigan’s muscles relaxed on command, though confusion prickled under his skin. He took the padd and read the document displayed on it.

>**V Department Memo (Black Ops).**  
You have been accepted into the ranks of the few and the deaths of the many.  
This is a ten-year contract.  
If you sign this, your life will be forfeit until year 2398.  
No public records will be kept.  
Your Starfleet service record will be sealed under the Classified Directive Act.  
Termination of this contract before completion is punishable under Article 47B of the Starfleet Code.  
Welcome to the dark side of the Federation.

He looked up, expecting to see the corner of Rink’s mouth twitch—maybe the faintest ghost of humor. But Rink’s face was a blank command console.

“Sir,” Dunnigan said cautiously, “is this… a joke?”

Rink didn’t answer. He just tapped the stylus twice against the desk.

Dunnigan’s pulse quickened. He signed.

When the digital signature sealed, the padd beeped softly. Rink’s back straightened like an automaton powering on. He raised a hand in salute. “Congratulations, *sir*.”

It took Dunnigan a few seconds to realize the word was directed at him. He hesitated before returning the salute.

That was the moment his life in Starfleet ended—and his service in the shadows began.

**The First Years: Gone Without a Trace**

They called it “The Vanish.” Recruits who disappeared into the V Department weren’t mentioned again. Their dorms were cleared overnight, their names erased from rosters. Fellow cadets would whisper theories—most thought it was some kind of Section 31 myth come to life.

Dunnigan didn’t correct them. He couldn’t.

His first assignment took him beneath the *Academy itself*—a sub-level even the engineering cadets didn’t know existed. The walls were dark, reinforced with something that didn’t reflect light properly. He was stripped of insignia, uniform replaced with matte black fatigues. The only emblem was a small, silver *V* on the collar—barely visible except under ultraviolet scan.

He trained there for months. Sleep was a privilege. Meals were nutrient packs labeled “Standard 5.” They were taught silence, resistance, deception, and infiltration—not against enemies, but against *everyone*, including Starfleet Command.

On day 91, he was brought into a room lit by a single overhead lamp.

A man in an unmarked uniform slid a padd across the table.  
“You’re going to forget everything you were before today.”

“I don’t understand.”

“You don’t need to. You’re Dunnigan now. That’s all that matters. Mission begins in forty-eight hours.”

He never saw the man again.

**Missions in the Dark**

Most of their work never reached reports. When the *USS Armstrong* went missing near the Badlands, Black Ops wasn’t dispatched to find survivors—they were sent to *retrieve data cores* and destroy what was left.

When a Klingon listening post detected an illegal Federation experiment near the Neutral Zone, Dunnigan’s team was already there, wiping out evidence before the Klingons could send a single transmission.

They didn’t wear uniforms. They didn’t use names. Even the ships they used were ghosts—no registry, no transponder, no log entries. They moved in the spaces between official reports, ghosts of the Federation’s conscience.

Once, on a covert mission in the Beta Quadrant, they intercepted a Romulan cell experimenting with neural subspace links—technology that could control thought remotely. The mission log, if it existed, would have read something like this:

>**Objective:** Neutralize Romulan research and destroy data.  
**Casualties:** 3 friendly, 27 hostile.  
**Outcome:** Success.

But what the log wouldn’t say was what Dunnigan saw when he entered the laboratory—a room filled with rows of connected minds, Romulan and human both, their consciousnesses merged into a hive of pure terror. He ended it with a single phaser sweep.

That night, he didn’t sleep.

**The Long Silence**

After years, missions began to blur together. He stopped counting days. Black Ops didn’t have shore leave or promotions; you either completed your decade or you didn’t.

There were rumors among his team. Some said the contract wasn’t ten years—it was *forever*. That the people who “retired” were sent to colonies under new identities, memory wiped clean.

Dunnigan didn’t believe that. At least, he didn’t want to.

By year eight, he led a small strike group called *Specter Unit 3.* They operated deep in the Gamma Quadrant, dismantling old Dominion strongholds before the Founders could rearm.

One mission went wrong—fatally wrong.

They had been tasked with recovering a data core from an abandoned Dominion facility orbiting a dying star. When the team breached the core chamber, they triggered a security countermeasure. Dunnigan saw it too late—the room filled with a green energy pulse that turned two of his men into light before they hit the ground.

He barely made it out alive.

In the aftermath, the V Department commander contacted him via encrypted subspace.

“Mission complete. Casualties acknowledged. Data recovered. Report for debrief.”

Dunnigan asked what was on the core.

The reply:

>“Classified above your clearance, Captain.”

That was the moment he knew he would never understand who he truly worked for.

**The Tenth Year**

His final mission was supposed to be simple: monitor a rogue Starfleet scientist attempting to defect to the Romulans. Dunnigan shadowed him through half the quadrant, across freighters and border stations, until finally confronting him in a decaying orbital habitat near Nimbus III.

The man begged for asylum, claiming he had uncovered a secret about the V Department itself—something about sleeper agents inside Starfleet Command. Dunnigan was ordered to “resolve” the situation.

He didn’t ask questions. He never did anymore.

He set his phaser to vaporize.

**Aftermath: The Fisherman**

On the morning of his “retirement,” Dunnigan reported to a quiet office in Geneva. A single official waited behind a desk with a padd and a smile that didn’t reach his eyes.

“Your contract is complete,” the man said. “Your records have been restored to civilian status. We thank you for your service.”

A few signatures later, Dunnigan ceased to exist in every classified file. His service number, erased. His face, untagged from every database.

He moved to a small fishing cabin north of Anchorage—just water, mountains, and silence. He never spoke about his service. When neighbors asked, he’d just say, “I used to work for the government. Paperwork mostly.”

Every morning, he’d rise before dawn, take his old wooden boat out into the mist, and cast a line. The sound of the reel and the call of distant gulls became his meditation.

He aged quietly. Peacefully. Forgotten.

Sometimes, when the wind shifted across the lake, he’d catch faint echoes—static, barely audible words from a world he’d left behind.

>“Specter Unit… report in.”

He’d close his eyes, take a slow breath, and reel in the line. The signal always faded, leaving only the gentle slap of water against the hull.

**Epilogue**

In the Federation archives, there is no record of Ensign Dunnigan after 2388.  
His service file ends with:

>“Status: Discharged. Cause: Retirement.”

No commendations. No demerits. Just blank space.

But somewhere out there—in classified vaults beneath Starfleet Command—one sealed file remains.

>**V DEPARTMENT / BLACK OPS — OPERATOR DUNNIGAN**  
**Status:** Complete.  
**Survivor:** 1.  
**Remarks:** Mission ongoing.

And at dawn, on a quiet lake on Earth, an old man casts his line, watching the sunrise burn gold over the horizon—never realizing the satellite above him still watches, and still calls him by the name he tried to forget.

1oq0u61,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1oq0u61/the_lullaby_wont_go_away_but_no_one_remembers_it/,"The lullaby won't go away, but no one remembers it.","Before I begin, please know that I have not had any psychological issues for years. Day to day, I work as an attorney and am even running for office. I am a normal person. A good person even. I am hoping that someone here can help me figure out where the music is coming from.

I woke up precisely at 7:55 like I have every morning I can remember. I haven’t needed it since I turned 13, but I always set an alarm just in case. Reaching for my phone to turn it off, I remembered the dream I was having. A green park in a small town square out of a picture book. Surrounded by an old crimson brick wall that somehow looked as new as if it had been built yesterday. And a polite white bench.

I know I have never been to this park. I doubt anyone has been to a park like that since the 1950s. But I’ve had recurring dreams of it—first when I started my senior year of high school and now again since Bree started my campaign. But it still feels deeply familiar. Like a park that I might have visited when I was a young boy.

This time, though, something was subtly different. More the impression of the dream than the experience. The trees in the park were still tall, but they were ominous—not lofty. The brick wall was still solid, but it was impenetrable—not sturdy. And remembering the dream now, I think it ended differently this time. I can’t remember how, but there was something new. A presence that woke me up with a sense of overwhelm instead of peace.

When I picked up my phone, I had already missed several texts from Bree. One a perfunctory good morning, “Hey, little brother! Big day today! Proud of you!” Then a handful laying out my schedule for the day. Work at the office from 9 to 5. Then at the campaign headquarters from 5 to 9. I know that my days will grow longer as the election approaches. For now, working the schedule of a normal lawyer seems easy.

I put my feet down on his apartment’s cold wooden floor and walked to the television hanging opposite my bed. I turned it on just as the theme song for the local morning news started.

Somehow, Dotty is still hosting. She may look like a Great Value Miss America anymore, but she is still holding on. Even if her permed blonde hair seems to be permanently strangling her gray roots.

“Good morning, Mason County!,” she rasped in an effortful echo of her younger voice. “It’s another sunny day! Even if the clouds disagree.” I let some air out of my nose. Dotty’s jokes have not gotten better with age. “Today’s top story: the race for Mason County’s seat in the state legislature. Young hometown attorney Mikey is running to unseat 12-term incumbent Senator Pruce whose office was recently the subject of an ethics investigation that has since been closed at the governor’s order.”

Bree’s publicist has done a good job. I barely recognize myself in the photograph. When I look in the mirror, I see a too tired and too skinny nerd whose hair is too black to be brown and too brown to be black. On the TV, the glasses I am always anxious about keeping clean actually make me look smart. Especially next to my wrinkly plum of an opponent. I don’t hate Pruce, but he was certainly made for the world before Instagram.

“The latest polling shows Pruce with a substantial lead thanks largely to the district’s heavy partisan tilt. Mikey’s campaign, led admirably by his sister Bree, is under-resourced but earnest. And his themes of bipartisanship, town-and-gown partnership, and clean government along with the campaign’s mastery of social media seem to be appealing to younger voters.” I can’t disagree with the narrative there. With only a fraction of our parents’ promised funds having come through, Bree has done a lot with a little.

Still listening to Dotty’s monologue about the job losses threatened by federal cuts to Mason County Community College’s budget, I showered and shaved. I put on my Monday coat and tie while the frumpled weatherman tried to make a week of clouds sound pleasant. When I grabbed the remote to turn off the TV, Dotty teased, “Remember to join us this Friday night for the first and only debate between Mikey and Senator Pruce. The world–or at least our studio–will be watching.” At exactly 8:50 am, I grabbed my coffee and opened the door.

Walking out to find my door being watched impatiently by Rosa the cleaner, I paused for just a moment. I reminded myself that I am happy. I graduated from an Ivy League school. I opened my own law office. I am running for office. And my parents, according to their Facebook posts, are proud of me.

Using the mindfulness techniques that my therapists have taught me, I brought myself back to the present. I turned to Rosa and gave her a pleasant smile. “Buenos días, Rosa!,” I recited in perfect Spanish. “Gracias por limpiar mi lugar y todos tu arduo trabajo.” Every person is a potential voter.

Looking into the mop water on Rosa’s cart, I found myself thrust back into memory of this morning’s dream. I remembered that I was stirred by the strange feeling of drowning in something other than water. Something thin and gauzy. Then I remembered the sight that I saw right before opening my eyes. The material I was drowning in was bright, almost neon pink—somewhere between Pepto-Bismol and that hard bubblegum I used to get at church. I know the park dream happens when I am stressed, but this hot pink funeral shroud was something new.

I caught myself. It was time to work. Once I got to the office, I worked on pleasantly mundane tasks: drafting a complaint, reviewing a deposition transcript, checking the mail. I even found something to like about billing hours. I am fortunate. Unlike most of my law school classmates, I actually like being a lawyer.

Or I did. As I brought in more and more work, my family had started to help me. My mother emails to make sure I am keeping at a healthy weight. My father has Bree check in to make sure I am making enough money. When Bree started to plan the campaign, she started to advise me on which clients and cases I should take. Of course, none of these suggestions are optional.

With 4:00 pm approaching, I prepared for a meeting with a potential client. Since I am one of the very few attorneys in town—perhaps the only one without a drinking problem—I never know what kind of client or case these meetings are going to bring. At precisely 4:00 pm, I opened the door to see a round man with a look like he was meeting an old friend.

I welcomed him in and listened to his story. The man explained that he had just been released from the Mason County Correctional Facility. Apparently, this was supposed to be a civil rights case. The man described the conditions in the prison. I wished I could be surprised at the routine violations of basic laws and human rights. I can’t be. I grew up hearing the same stories from some of my extended family—third cousins and the like. This was the kind of case I had become a lawyer to take. But I knew I couldn’t take this one. I can’t look anti-cop with the election just two weeks away.

“So that’s my story,” the man concluded.

“I understand,” I lied kindly. “Thank you for sharing with me.” I meant that part.

“Do you think you can help me, Mr. Mikey?”

“I’m not sure. Let me step out and call my associate.”

I left the cramped conference room that used to be a kitchen. Pulling up my recents to call Bree, I realized I have been using a creative definition of “associate” over the past few months.

Bree answered efficiently. “Hey! Are you on the way?”

“Not quite. I’m wrapping up a meeting with a potential client.”

“Is this another soft-on-crime case?”

“It’s not soft on crime. It’s…,” I began to protest.

“No. Absolutely not.” The law had spoken. “You know we can’t take those cases this close to the election. You’re running to make the change that will keep those cases from happening in the first place. You can’t let your feelings make you sacrifice your future.” I wondered why Bree said that “we” couldn’t take the case.

“Yeah. You’re right. I’ll see you soon.”

As I opened the door to tell the man the news, the man’s phone rang. I knew I remembered that song. Slow. Sweet. I knew it was a lullaby, but I couldn’t place it.

*If you’re not feeling happy today,*

*Just put on a smiling face.*

*It will make the pain go away*

*Before you forget to say…*

Remembering those lyrics, I felt seen. And watched.

“So, what’s the verdict?,” the man hoped out loud.

“I’m sorry, sir. The firm just can’t take on a case like yours at the moment. If you’d like, I can refer you to some other attorneys.”

“No thanks. I’ll take this as my answer.”

I flinched at that then continued the script.

“Well, thank you for coming in. It’s always a pleasure to meet someone from our town.”

Waiting for me to open the door, the man mumbled genuinely, “Sure. Thanks for your time. I’m still going to vote for you.”

I went to close the door behind the man but couldn’t stop myself from asking. “Excuse me. Sir?” The man turned around halfway down the brick walkway. “I love your ringtone. What song is that? I know I heard it when I was a kid, but I can’t remember the name.”

The man looked at me like I had just asked if his prison cell had been on Jupiter. “I think it’s called Marimba or something. It’s just the default.”

I gave the man a kind nod. Closing the door behind him, I tried to shake off the feeling that came over me when I heard that song. It made me feel uncomfortably aware of the man’s eyes on me when I braced to deliver the bad news. It was like the man was suddenly joined by an invisible audience that waited for me to say the lines I had rehearsed so many times. The song reminded me of something always waiting just out of sight—waiting to swallow me whole if I ever failed to act my part.

I walked back to my desk, shut my laptop, and grabbed my blazer on the way out the door. In the past, I might have stayed late to work on cases. Not this year.

Driving through town, I passed the old bookstore where I spent hours on afternoons when my parents were working and Bree was building her resume with one extracurricular or another. The owner, Mrs. Brown, had always made me feel at home. I’m not sure if it was because of her failing memory or because she saw just what I needed, but Mrs. Brown always left me alone.

Walking from the car to the double dark-paneled wooden doors, I appreciated that the mayor who had ordered the renovation had at least thought to preserve the building’s frame. It has been there longer than anyone still alive in the aging county.

Tired of fighting it, Bree pushed her a runaway wisp of black hair out of her face with a red headband. I smiled to myself thinking about Bree doing that as a girl. She has always been too serious to bother with her hair.

“Anti-corruption is still your strongest issue. People seem to like that coming from someone young and idealistic. The question is whether it will be enough to get people to the polls when Pruce has the culture war on his side.”

I nodded at the right time. I wanted to pay attention. Bree worked hard to prepare this report, but it is hard to focus when I know my opinions don’t matter. Bree makes the decisions for the campaign, and the polls make the decisions for Bree. I hate myself for being so cynical, but I am a politician now. I am just the smiling face on the well-oiled machine.

When Bree started to explain the campaign schedule up through Friday’s debate, I heard something familiar. It sounded like a woman humming in the room next door. Except, in the office at the end of the narrow hallway, there was no room next door. I decided I wasn’t hearing anything.

Bree dictated, “Tomorrow, we have a meeting with Scarnes and Blumph, your publicists.”

*If you’re not feeling happy today…*

The wordless music continued, now coming from both the room that wasn’t next door and behind the professor’s daughter’s desk.

My decision failed me. I was definitely hearing something. I told myself maybe it was an old toy in one of the cardboard boxes that towered in the corner opposite me. I looked up at Bree to see if she heard anything. She reported on without a moment’s hesitation.

“Then on Wednesday we have the meet and greet at the nature center.”

Moving my head as little as possible, I began to dart my eyes around the room. The music was coming from above me now. I thought there might have been an attic there before the renovation.

*Just put on a smiling face…*

I tried my best to look focused. I am always trying my best.

“On Thursday, we have your appearance for seniors at the YMCA.”

I fought to keep breathing, but the air was leaving me. The music, now all around me and getting louder, was almost suffocating. I was drowning in it.

*It’ll make the pain go away…*

My nerves began to demand my body move. First my fingers began to tap the chair’s worn arm. The music grew louder. Then my feet joined in. The music was nearly deafening.

At that, Bree looked up from her papers. For another fleeting moment, she looked at me like a sibling instead of a campaign manager. But this time it was a look of concern instead of affection.

“You good?” Bree’s question was almost drowned out by the song.

“Yeah, yeah. I’m fine. Probably just too much coffee.” I felt like I was shouting, but I know I was using my inside voice.

Almost as scared of Bree’s disappointment as the music from the void, I asked, “Do you hear something?”

The music stopped except for the faint hum from the woman in the room that wasn’t next door.

*Before you forget to say…*

“No.” Bree’s face looked just as I had feared. Worried but not willing to show it.

Silence kindly returned.

With an earnest attempt at earnestness, I pivoted. “And the debate’s Friday?”

“Right…” Bree said as if she were asking herself for permission to continue. “But I’ll do the walkthrough of the venue on Thursday.”

Bree haltingly continued to the financial section of her report, and I remembered. She used to sing the song to me before bed. It is called “Put on a Smiling Face,” and it is from *Sunnyside Square*. I think it was my favorite show as a kid.

I couldn't ask Bree about it. Not with the way she looked at me. But, after I left her office, I texted a few friends. No one remembers it. Does anyone here? The show aired in Mason County in the 90s, and the lullaby was its theme song. I don’t remember anything else right now.

Day to day, I work as an attorney and am even running for office. I am a normal person. A good person even. I am hoping that someone here can help me figure out where the music is coming from.

I woke up precisely at 7:55 like I have every morning I can remember. I haven’t needed it since I turned 13, but I always set an alarm just in case. Reaching for my phone to turn it off, I remembered the dream I was having. A green park in a small town square out of a picture book. Surrounded by an old crimson brick wall that somehow looked as new as if it had been built yesterday. And a polite white bench.

I know I have never been to this park. I doubt anyone has been to a park like that since the 1950s. But I’ve had recurring dreams of it—first when I started my senior year of high school and now again since Bree started my campaign. But it still feels deeply familiar. Like a park that I might have visited when I was a young boy.

This time, though, something was subtly different. More the impression of the dream than the experience. The trees in the park were still tall, but they were ominous—not lofty. The brick wall was still solid, but it was impenetrable—not sturdy. And remembering the dream now, I think it ended differently this time. I can’t remember how, but there was something new. A presence that woke me up with a sense of overwhelm instead of peace.

When I picked up my phone, I had already missed several texts from Bree. One a perfunctory good morning, “Hey, little brother! Big day today! Proud of you!” Then a handful laying out my schedule for the day. Work at the office from 9 to 5. Then at the campaign headquarters from 5 to 9. I know that my days will grow longer as the election approaches. For now, working the schedule of a normal lawyer seems easy.

I put my feet down on his apartment’s cold wooden floor and walked to the television hanging opposite my bed. I turned it on just as the theme song for the local morning news started.

Somehow, Dotty is still hosting. She may look like a Great Value Miss America anymore, but she is still holding on. Even if her permed blonde hair seems to be permanently strangling her gray roots.

“Good morning, Mason County!,” she rasped in an effortful echo of her younger voice. “It’s another sunny day! Even if the clouds disagree.” I let some air out of my nose. Dotty’s jokes have not gotten better with age. “Today’s top story: the race for Mason County’s seat in the state legislature. Young hometown attorney Mikey is running to unseat 12-term incumbent Senator Pruce whose office was recently the subject of an ethics investigation that has since been closed at the governor’s order.”

Bree’s publicist has done a good job. I barely recognize myself in the photograph. When I look in the mirror, I see a too tired and too skinny nerd whose hair is too black to be brown and too brown to be black. On the TV, the glasses I am always anxious about keeping clean actually make me look smart. Especially next to my wrinkly plum of an opponent. I don’t hate Pruce, but he was certainly made for the world before Instagram.

“The latest polling shows Pruce with a substantial lead thanks largely to the district’s heavy partisan tilt. Mikey’s campaign, led admirably by his sister Bree, is under-resourced but earnest. And his themes of bipartisanship, town-and-gown partnership, and clean government along with the campaign’s mastery of social media seem to be appealing to younger voters.” I can’t disagree with the narrative there. With only a fraction of our parents’ promised funds having come through, Bree has done a lot with a little.

Still listening to Dotty’s monologue about the job losses threatened by federal cuts to Mason County Community College’s budget, I showered and shaved. I put on my Monday coat and tie while the frumpled weatherman tried to make a week of clouds sound pleasant. When I grabbed the remote to turn off the TV, Dotty teased, “Remember to join us this Friday night for the first and only debate between Mikey and Senator Pruce. The world–or at least our studio–will be watching.” At exactly 8:50 am, I grabbed my coffee and opened the door.

Walking out to find my door being watched impatiently by Rosa the cleaner, I paused for just a moment. I reminded myself that I am happy. I graduated from an Ivy League school. I opened my own law office. I am running for office. And my parents, according to their Facebook posts, are proud of me.

Using the mindfulness techniques that my therapists have taught me, I brought myself back to the present. I turned to Rosa and gave her a pleasant smile. “Buenos días, Rosa!,” I recited in perfect Spanish. “Gracias por limpiar mi lugar y todos tu arduo trabajo.” Every person is a potential voter.

Looking into the mop water on Rosa’s cart, I found myself thrust back into memory of this morning’s dream. I remembered that I was stirred by the strange feeling of drowning in something other than water. Something thin and gauzy. Then I remembered the sight that I saw right before opening my eyes. The material I was drowning in was bright, almost neon pink—somewhere between Pepto-Bismol and that hard bubblegum I used to get at church. I know the park dream happens when I am stressed, but this hot pink funeral shroud was something new.

I caught myself. It was time to work. Once I got to the office, I worked on pleasantly mundane tasks: drafting a complaint, reviewing a deposition transcript, checking the mail. I even found something to like about billing hours. I am fortunate. Unlike most of my law school classmates, I actually like being a lawyer.

Or I did. As I brought in more and more work, my family had started to help me. My mother emails to make sure I am keeping at a healthy weight. My father has Bree check in to make sure I am making enough money. When Bree started to plan the campaign, she started to advise me on which clients and cases I should take. Of course, none of these suggestions are optional.

With 4:00 pm approaching, I prepared for a meeting with a potential client. Since I am one of the very few attorneys in town—perhaps the only one without a drinking problem—I never know what kind of client or case these meetings are going to bring. At precisely 4:00 pm, I opened the door to see a round man with a look like he was meeting an old friend.

I welcomed him in and listened to his story. The man explained that he had just been released from the Mason County Correctional Facility. Apparently, this was supposed to be a civil rights case. The man described the conditions in the prison. I wished I could be surprised at the routine violations of basic laws and human rights. I can’t be. I grew up hearing the same stories from some of my extended family—third cousins and the like. This was the kind of case I had become a lawyer to take. But I knew I couldn’t take this one. I can’t look anti-cop with the election just two weeks away.

“So that’s my story,” the man concluded.

“I understand,” I lied kindly. “Thank you for sharing with me.” I meant that part.

“Do you think you can help me, Mr. Mikey?”

“I’m not sure. Let me step out and call my associate.”

I left the cramped conference room that used to be a kitchen. Pulling up my recents to call Bree, I realized I have been using a creative definition of “associate” over the past few months.

Bree answered efficiently. “Hey! Are you on the way?”

“Not quite. I’m wrapping up a meeting with a potential client.”

“Is this another soft-on-crime case?”

“It’s not soft on crime. It’s…,” I began to protest.

“No. Absolutely not.” The law had spoken. “You know we can’t take those cases this close to the election. You’re running to make the change that will keep those cases from happening in the first place. You can’t let your feelings make you sacrifice your future.” I wondered why Bree said that “we” couldn’t take the case.

“Yeah. You’re right. I’ll see you soon.”

As I opened the door to tell the man the news, the man’s phone rang. I knew I remembered that song. Slow. Sweet. I knew it was a lullaby, but I couldn’t place it.

*If you’re not feeling happy today,*

*Just put on a smiling face.*

*It will make the pain go away*

*Before you forget to say…*

Remembering those lyrics, I felt seen. And watched.

“So, what’s the verdict?,” the man hoped out loud.

“I’m sorry, sir. The firm just can’t take on a case like yours at the moment. If you’d like, I can refer you to some other attorneys.”

“No thanks. I’ll take this as my answer.”

I flinched at that then continued the script.

“Well, thank you for coming in. It’s always a pleasure to meet someone from our town.”

Waiting for me to open the door, the man mumbled genuinely, “Sure. Thanks for your time. I’m still going to vote for you.”

I went to close the door behind the man but couldn’t stop myself from asking. “Excuse me. Sir?” The man turned around halfway down the brick walkway. “I love your ringtone. What song is that? I know I heard it when I was a kid, but I can’t remember the name.”

The man looked at me like I had just asked if his prison cell had been on Jupiter. “I think it’s called Marimba or something. It’s just the default.”

I gave the man a kind nod. Closing the door behind him, I tried to shake off the feeling that came over me when I heard that song. It made me feel uncomfortably aware of the man’s eyes on me when I braced to deliver the bad news. It was like the man was suddenly joined by an invisible audience that waited for me to say the lines I had rehearsed so many times. The song reminded me of something always waiting just out of sight—waiting to swallow me whole if I ever failed to act my part.

I walked back to my desk, shut my laptop, and grabbed my blazer on the way out the door. In the past, I might have stayed late to work on cases. Not this year.

Driving through town, I passed the old bookstore where I spent hours on afternoons when my parents were working and Bree was building her resume with one extracurricular or another. The owner, Mrs. Brown, had always made me feel at home. I’m not sure if it was because of her failing memory or because she saw just what I needed, but Mrs. Brown always left me alone. I cherished that time alone with Mrs. Brown where I could breathe without someone’s eyes waiting for me to do something wrong. Something that the kids at school would make fun of and my family would try to fix. In Mrs. Brown’s store, I could just *be*.

By the time memory had taken me to junior year when Mrs. Brown’s store was run out of the market by internet sales, I had arrived at my campaign office. That is probably not the right word. It is more the building that my campaign office is in. The building that was the town civic center some decades ago. Now it’s been converted into a rarely-used venue for weddings and receptions and overflow offices for some of the mayor’s staff. One of these town employees is the daughter of one of Bree’s favorite professors, and he convinced her to let Bree borrow it after city work hours.

Walking from the car to the double dark-paneled wooden doors, I appreciated that the mayor who had ordered the renovation had at least thought to preserve the building’s frame. It has been there longer than anyone still alive in the aging county.

Bree was waiting just inside the dust-odored lobby when I opened the doors. Before either of us said anything, Bree gave me a flash of a smile. We always have this moment. Before we start talking about the campaign or our careers or what we can do better, Bree looks at me like a proud big sister happy to see her little brother. I remember this smile from our childhood, but it became fainter and rarer as Bree aged and took on more responsibilities. Ever since our father informed us that Bree would be running my campaign, the smile has only come in these flashes.

“Hey. Good day at work?” Bree asked perfunctorily. I love her for trying.

“Normal,” I said, following Bree down the side hallway to the cramped office. “So I can’t complain.”

“I’m glad,” Bree answered. I wasn’t sure if she was glad I had a good day or glad I was not complaining. Probably both.

We sat down in the professor’s daughter’s town-issued pleather chairs, and Bree commenced.

“Thank you for coming this evening.” She runs these meetings like she is reading a profit and loss statement in a Fortune 500 conference room. Sometimes I wonder if she rather would be. “The polling is still not optimal. We’re trailing 45 to 50 with 8 percent undecided. The latest social campaign went well. The A-B testing found that the voters prefer you in a red tie so we’ll stick with that going forward.”

Tired of fighting it, Bree pushed her a runaway wisp of black hair out of her face with a red headband. I smiled to myself thinking about Bree doing that as a girl. She has always been too serious to bother with her hair.

“Anti-corruption is still your strongest issue. People seem to like that coming from someone young and idealistic. The question is whether it will be enough to get people to the polls when Pruce has the culture war on his side.”

Moving my head as little as possible, I began to dart my eyes around the room. The music was coming from above me now. I thought there might have been an attic there before the renovation.

“Hey. Good day at work?” Bree asked perfunctorily. I love her for trying.

“Normal,” I said, following Bree down the side hallway to the cramped office. “So I can’t complain.”

“I’m glad,” Bree answered. I wasn’t sure if she was glad I had a good day or glad I was not complaining. Probably both.

We sat down in the professor’s daughter’s town-issued pleather chairs, and Bree commenced.

“Thank you for coming this evening.” She runs these meetings like she is reading a profit and loss statement in a Fortune 500 conference room. Sometimes I wonder if she rather would be. “The polling is still not optimal. We’re trailing 45 to 50 with 8 percent undecided. The latest social campaign went well. The A-B testing found that the voters prefer you in a red tie so we’ll stick with that going forward.”

Tired of fighting it, Bree pushed her a runaway wisp of black hair out of her face with a red headband. I smiled to myself thinking about Bree doing that as a girl. She has always been too serious to bother with her hair.

“Anti-corruption is still your strongest issue. People seem to like that coming from someone young and idealistic. The question is whether it will be enough to get people to the polls when Pruce has the culture war on his side.”

I nodded at the right time. I wanted to pay attention. Bree worked hard to prepare this report, but it is hard to focus when I know my opinions don’t matter. Bree makes the decisions for the campaign, and the polls make the decisions for Bree. I hate myself for being so cynical, but I am a politician now. I am just the smiling face on the well-oiled machine.

When Bree started to explain the campaign schedule up through Friday’s debate, I heard something familiar. It sounded like a woman humming in the room next door. Except, in the office at the end of the narrow hallway, there was no room next door. I decided I wasn’t hearing anything.

Bree dictated, “Tomorrow, we have a meeting with Scarnes and Blumph, your publicists.”

*If you’re not feeling happy today…*

The wordless music continued, now coming from both the room that wasn’t next door and behind the professor’s daughter’s desk.

My decision failed me. I was definitely hearing something. I told myself maybe it was an old toy in one of the cardboard boxes that towered in the corner opposite me. I looked up at Bree to see if she heard anything. She reported on without a moment’s hesitation.

“Then on Wednesday we have the meet and greet at the nature center.”

Moving my head as little as possible, I began to dart my eyes around the room. The music was coming from above me now. I thought there might have been an attic there before the renovation.

*Just put on a smiling face…*

I tried my best to look focused. I am always trying my best.

“On Thursday, we have your appearance for seniors at the YMCA.”

I fought to keep breathing, but the air was leaving me. The music, now all around me and getting louder, was almost suffocating. I was drowning in it.

*It’ll make the pain go away…*

My nerves began to demand my body move. First my fingers began to tap the chair’s worn arm. The music grew louder. Then my feet joined in. The music was nearly deafening.

At that, Bree looked up from her papers. For another fleeting moment, she looked at me like a sibling instead of a campaign manager. But this time it was a look of concern instead of affection.

“You good?” Bree’s question was almost drowned out by the song.

“Yeah, yeah. I’m fine. Probably just too much coffee.” I felt like I was shouting, but I know I was using my inside voice.

Almost as scared of Bree’s disappointment as the music from the void, I asked, “Do you hear something?”

The music stopped except for the faint hum from the woman in the room that wasn’t next door.

*Before you forget to say…*

“No.” Bree’s face looked just as I had feared. Worried but not willing to show it.

Silence kindly returned.

With an earnest attempt at earnestness, I pivoted. “And the debate’s Friday?”

“Right…” Bree said as if she were asking herself for permission to continue. “But I’ll do the walkthrough of the venue on Thursday.”

Bree haltingly continued to the financial section of her report, and I remembered. She used to sing the song to me before bed. It is called “Put on a Smiling Face,” and it is from *Sunnyside Square*. I think it was my favorite show as a kid.

I couldn't ask Bree about it. Not with the way she looked at me. But, after I left her office, I texted a few friends. No one remembers it. Does anyone here? The show aired in Mason County in the 90s, and the lullaby was its theme song. I don’t remember anything else right now.

1oq0tpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1oq0tpm/the_lullaby_wont_go_away_but_no_one_remembers_it/,"The lullaby won't go away, but no one remembers it.","Before I begin, please know that I have not had any psychological issues for years. Day to day, I work as an attorney and am even running for office. I am a normal person. A good person even. I am hoping that someone here can help me figure out where the music is coming from.

I woke up precisely at 7:55 like I have every morning I can remember. I haven’t needed it since I turned 13, but I always set an alarm just in case. Reaching for my phone to turn it off, I remembered the dream I was having. A green park in a small town square out of a picture book. Surrounded by an old crimson brick wall that somehow looked as new as if it had been built yesterday. And a polite white bench.

I know I have never been to this park. I doubt anyone has been to a park like that since the 1950s. But I’ve had recurring dreams of it—first when I started my senior year of high school and now again since Bree started my campaign. But it still feels deeply familiar. Like a park that I might have visited when I was a young boy.

This time, though, something was subtly different. More the impression of the dream than the experience. The trees in the park were still tall, but they were ominous—not lofty. The brick wall was still solid, but it was impenetrable—not sturdy. And remembering the dream now, I think it ended differently this time. I can’t remember how, but there was something new. A presence that woke me up with a sense of overwhelm instead of peace.

When I picked up my phone, I had already missed several texts from Bree. One a perfunctory good morning, “Hey, little brother! Big day today! Proud of you!” Then a handful laying out my schedule for the day. Work at the office from 9 to 5. Then at the campaign headquarters from 5 to 9. I know that my days will grow longer as the election approaches. For now, working the schedule of a normal lawyer seems easy.

I put my feet down on his apartment’s cold wooden floor and walked to the television hanging opposite my bed. I turned it on just as the theme song for the local morning news started.

Somehow, Dotty is still hosting. She may look like a Great Value Miss America anymore, but she is still holding on. Even if her permed blonde hair seems to be permanently strangling her gray roots.

“Good morning, Mason County!,” she rasped in an effortful echo of her younger voice. “It’s another sunny day! Even if the clouds disagree.” I let some air out of my nose. Dotty’s jokes have not gotten better with age. “Today’s top story: the race for Mason County’s seat in the state legislature. Young hometown attorney Mikey is running to unseat 12-term incumbent Senator Pruce whose office was recently the subject of an ethics investigation that has since been closed at the governor’s order.”

Bree’s publicist has done a good job. I barely recognize myself in the photograph. When I look in the mirror, I see a too tired and too skinny nerd whose hair is too black to be brown and too brown to be black. On the TV, the glasses I am always anxious about keeping clean actually make me look smart. Especially next to my wrinkly plum of an opponent. I don’t hate Pruce, but he was certainly made for the world before Instagram.

“The latest polling shows Pruce with a substantial lead thanks largely to the district’s heavy partisan tilt. Mikey’s campaign, led admirably by his sister Bree, is under-resourced but earnest. And his themes of bipartisanship, town-and-gown partnership, and clean government along with the campaign’s mastery of social media seem to be appealing to younger voters.” I can’t disagree with the narrative there. With only a fraction of our parents’ promised funds having come through, Bree has done a lot with a little.

Still listening to Dotty’s monologue about the job losses threatened by federal cuts to Mason County Community College’s budget, I showered and shaved. I put on my Monday coat and tie while the frumpled weatherman tried to make a week of clouds sound pleasant. When I grabbed the remote to turn off the TV, Dotty teased, “Remember to join us this Friday night for the first and only debate between Mikey and Senator Pruce. The world–or at least our studio–will be watching.” At exactly 8:50 am, I grabbed my coffee and opened the door.

Walking out to find my door being watched impatiently by Rosa the cleaner, I paused for just a moment. I reminded myself that I am happy. I graduated from an Ivy League school. I opened my own law office. I am running for office. And my parents, according to their Facebook posts, are proud of me.

Using the mindfulness techniques that my therapists have taught me, I brought myself back to the present. I turned to Rosa and gave her a pleasant smile. “Buenos días, Rosa!,” I recited in perfect Spanish. “Gracias por limpiar mi lugar y todos tu arduo trabajo.” Every person is a potential voter.

Looking into the mop water on Rosa’s cart, I found myself thrust back into memory of this morning’s dream. I remembered that I was stirred by the strange feeling of drowning in something other than water. Something thin and gauzy. Then I remembered the sight that I saw right before opening my eyes. The material I was drowning in was bright, almost neon pink—somewhere between Pepto-Bismol and that hard bubblegum I used to get at church. I know the park dream happens when I am stressed, but this hot pink funeral shroud was something new.

I caught myself. It was time to work. Once I got to the office, I worked on pleasantly mundane tasks: drafting a complaint, reviewing a deposition transcript, checking the mail. I even found something to like about billing hours. I am fortunate. Unlike most of my law school classmates, I actually like being a lawyer.

Or I did. As I brought in more and more work, my family had started to help me. My mother emails to make sure I am keeping at a healthy weight. My father has Bree check in to make sure I am making enough money. When Bree started to plan the campaign, she started to advise me on which clients and cases I should take. Of course, none of these suggestions are optional.

With 4:00 pm approaching, I prepared for a meeting with a potential client. Since I am one of the very few attorneys in town—perhaps the only one without a drinking problem—I never know what kind of client or case these meetings are going to bring. At precisely 4:00 pm, I opened the door to see a round man with a look like he was meeting an old friend.

I welcomed him in and listened to his story. The man explained that he had just been released from the Mason County Correctional Facility. Apparently, this was supposed to be a civil rights case. The man described the conditions in the prison. I wished I could be surprised at the routine violations of basic laws and human rights. I can’t be. I grew up hearing the same stories from some of my extended family—third cousins and the like. This was the kind of case I had become a lawyer to take. But I knew I couldn’t take this one. I can’t look anti-cop with the election just two weeks away.

“So that’s my story,” the man concluded.

“I understand,” I lied kindly. “Thank you for sharing with me.” I meant that part.

“Do you think you can help me, Mr. Mikey?”

“I’m not sure. Let me step out and call my associate.”

I left the cramped conference room that used to be a kitchen. Pulling up my recents to call Bree, I realized I have been using a creative definition of “associate” over the past few months.

Bree answered efficiently. “Hey! Are you on the way?”

“Not quite. I’m wrapping up a meeting with a potential client.”

“Is this another soft-on-crime case?”

“It’s not soft on crime. It’s…,” I began to protest.

“No. Absolutely not.” The law had spoken. “You know we can’t take those cases this close to the election. You’re running to make the change that will keep those cases from happening in the first place. You can’t let your feelings make you sacrifice your future.” I wondered why Bree said that “we” couldn’t take the case.

“Yeah. You’re right. I’ll see you soon.”

As I opened the door to tell the man the news, the man’s phone rang. I knew I remembered that song. Slow. Sweet. I knew it was a lullaby, but I couldn’t place it.

*If you’re not feeling happy today,*

*Just put on a smiling face.*

*It will make the pain go away*

*Before you forget to say…*

Remembering those lyrics, I felt seen. And watched.

“So, what’s the verdict?,” the man hoped out loud.

“I’m sorry, sir. The firm just can’t take on a case like yours at the moment. If you’d like, I can refer you to some other attorneys.”

“No thanks. I’ll take this as my answer.”

I flinched at that then continued the script.

“Well, thank you for coming in. It’s always a pleasure to meet someone from our town.”

Waiting for me to open the door, the man mumbled genuinely, “Sure. Thanks for your time. I’m still going to vote for you.”

I went to close the door behind the man but couldn’t stop myself from asking. “Excuse me. Sir?” The man turned around halfway down the brick walkway. “I love your ringtone. What song is that? I know I heard it when I was a kid, but I can’t remember the name.”

The man looked at me like I had just asked if his prison cell had been on Jupiter. “I think it’s called Marimba or something. It’s just the default.”

I gave the man a kind nod. Closing the door behind him, I tried to shake off the feeling that came over me when I heard that song. It made me feel uncomfortably aware of the man’s eyes on me when I braced to deliver the bad news. It was like the man was suddenly joined by an invisible audience that waited for me to say the lines I had rehearsed so many times. The song reminded me of something always waiting just out of sight—waiting to swallow me whole if I ever failed to act my part.

I walked back to my desk, shut my laptop, and grabbed my blazer on the way out the door. In the past, I might have stayed late to work on cases. Not this year.

Driving through town, I passed the old bookstore where I spent hours on afternoons when my parents were working and Bree was building her resume with one extracurricular or another. The owner, Mrs. Brown, had always made me feel at home. I’m not sure if it was because of her failing memory or because she saw just what I needed, but Mrs. Brown always left me alone. I cherished that time alone with Mrs. Brown where I could breathe without someone’s eyes waiting for me to do something wrong. Something that the kids at school would make fun of and my family would try to fix. In Mrs. Brown’s store, I could just *be*.

By the time memory had taken me to junior year when Mrs. Brown’s store was run out of the market by internet sales, I had arrived at my campaign office. That is probably not the right word. It is more the building that my campaign office is in. The building that was the town civic center some decades ago. Now it’s been converted into a rarely-used venue for weddings and receptions and overflow offices for some of the mayor’s staff. One of these town employees is the daughter of one of Bree’s favorite professors, and he convinced her to let Bree borrow it after city work hours.

Walking from the car to the double dark-paneled wooden doors, I appreciated that the mayor who had ordered the renovation had at least thought to preserve the building’s frame. It has been there longer than anyone still alive in the aging county.

Bree was waiting just inside the dust-odored lobby when I opened the doors. Before either of us said anything, Bree gave me a flash of a smile. We always have this moment. Before we start talking about the campaign or our careers or what we can do better, Bree looks at me like a proud big sister happy to see her little brother. I remember this smile from our childhood, but it became fainter and rarer as Bree aged and took on more responsibilities. Ever since our father informed us that Bree would be running my campaign, the smile has only come in these flashes.

“Hey. Good day at work?” Bree asked perfunctorily. I love her for trying.

“Normal,” I said, following Bree down the side hallway to the cramped office. “So I can’t complain.”

“I’m glad,” Bree answered. I wasn’t sure if she was glad I had a good day or glad I was not complaining. Probably both.

Since I am one of the very few attorneys in town—perhaps the only one without a drinking problem—I never know what kind of client or case these meetings are going to bring. At precisely 4:00 pm, I opened the door to see a round man with a look like he was meeting an old friend.

I welcomed him in and listened to his story. The man explained that he had just been released from the Mason County Correctional Facility. Apparently, this was supposed to be a civil rights case. The man described the conditions in the prison. I wished I could be surprised at the routine violations of basic laws and human rights. I can’t be. I grew up hearing the same stories from some of my extended family—third cousins and the like. This was the kind of case I had become a lawyer to take. But I knew I couldn’t take this one. I can’t look anti-cop with the election just two weeks away.

“So that’s my story,” the man concluded.

“I understand,” I lied kindly. “Thank you for sharing with me.” I meant that part.

“Do you think you can help me, Mr. Mikey?”

“I’m not sure. Let me step out and call my associate.”

I left the cramped conference room that used to be a kitchen. Pulling up my recents to call Bree, I realized I have been using a creative definition of “associate” over the past few months.

Bree answered efficiently. “Hey! Are you on the way?”

“Not quite. I’m wrapping up a meeting with a potential client.”

“Is this another soft-on-crime case?”

“It’s not soft on crime. It’s…,” I began to protest.

“No. Absolutely not.” The law had spoken. “You know we can’t take those cases this close to the election. You’re running to make the change that will keep those cases from happening in the first place. You can’t let your feelings make you sacrifice your future.” I wondered why Bree said that “we” couldn’t take the case.

“Yeah. You’re right. I’ll see you soon.”

As I opened the door to tell the man the news, the man’s phone rang. I knew I remembered that song. Slow. Sweet. I knew it was a lullaby, but I couldn’t place it.

*If you’re not feeling happy today,*

*Just put on a smiling face.*

*It will make the pain go away*

*Before you forget to say…*

Remembering those lyrics, I felt seen. And watched.

“So, what’s the verdict?,” the man hoped out loud.

“I’m sorry, sir. The firm just can’t take on a case like yours at the moment. If you’d like, I can refer you to some other attorneys.”

“No thanks. I’ll take this as my answer.”

I flinched at that then continued the script.

“Well, thank you for coming in. It’s always a pleasure to meet someone from our town.”

Waiting for me to open the door, the man mumbled genuinely, “Sure. Thanks for your time. I’m still going to vote for you.”

I went to close the door behind the man but couldn’t stop myself from asking. “Excuse me. Sir?” The man turned around halfway down the brick walkway. “I love your ringtone. What song is that? I know I heard it when I was a kid, but I can’t remember the name.”

The man looked at me like I had just asked if his prison cell had been on Jupiter. “I think it’s called Marimba or something. It’s just the default.”

I gave the man a kind nod. Closing the door behind him, I tried to shake off the feeling that came over me when I heard that song. It made me feel uncomfortably aware of the man’s eyes on me when I braced to deliver the bad news. It was like the man was suddenly joined by an invisible audience that waited for me to say the lines I had rehearsed so many times. The song reminded me of something always waiting just out of sight—waiting to swallow me whole if I ever failed to act my part.

I walked back to my desk, shut my laptop, and grabbed my blazer on the way out the door. In the past, I might have stayed late to work on cases. Not this year.

Driving through town, I passed the old bookstore where I spent hours on afternoons when my parents were working and Bree was building her resume with one extracurricular or another. The owner, Mrs. Brown, had always made me feel at home. I’m not sure if it was because of her failing memory or because she saw just what I needed, but Mrs. Brown always left me alone. I cherished that time alone with Mrs. Brown where I could breathe without someone’s eyes waiting for me to do something wrong. Something that the kids at school would make fun of and my family would try to fix. In Mrs. Brown’s store, I could just *be*.

By the time memory had taken me to junior year when Mrs. Brown’s store was run out of the market by internet sales, I had arrived at my campaign office. That is probably not the right word. It is more the building that my campaign office is in. The building that was the town civic center some decades ago. Now it’s been converted into a rarely-used venue for weddings and receptions and overflow offices for some of the mayor’s staff. One of these town employees is the daughter of one of Bree’s favorite professors, and he convinced her to let Bree borrow it after city work hours.

Walking from the car to the double dark-paneled wooden doors, I appreciated that the mayor who had ordered the renovation had at least thought to preserve the building’s frame. It has been there longer than anyone still alive in the aging county.

Bree was waiting just inside the dust-odored lobby when I opened the doors. Before either of us said anything, Bree gave me a flash of a smile. We always have this moment. Before we start talking about the campaign or our careers or what we can do better, Bree looks at me like a proud big sister happy to see her little brother. I remember this smile from our childhood, but it became fainter and rarer as Bree aged and took on more responsibilities. Ever since our father informed us that Bree would be running my campaign, the smile has only come in these flashes.

“Hey. Good day at work?” Bree asked perfunctorily. I love her for trying.

“Normal,” I said, following Bree down the side hallway to the cramped office. “So I can’t complain.”

“I’m glad,” Bree answered. I wasn’t sure if she was glad I had a good day or glad I was not complaining. Probably both.

We sat down in the professor’s daughter’s town-issued pleather chairs, and Bree commenced.

“Thank you for coming this evening.” She runs these meetings like she is reading a profit and loss statement in a Fortune 500 conference room. Sometimes I wonder if she rather would be. “The polling is still not optimal. We’re trailing 45 to 50 with 8 percent undecided. The latest social campaign went well. The A-B testing found that the voters prefer you in a red tie so we’ll stick with that going forward.”

Tired of fighting it, Bree pushed her a runaway wisp of black hair out of her face with a red headband. I smiled to myself thinking about Bree doing that as a girl. She has always been too serious to bother with her hair.

“Anti-corruption is still your strongest issue. People seem to like that coming from someone young and idealistic. The question is whether it will be enough to get people to the polls when Pruce has the culture war on his side.”

I nodded at the right time. I wanted to pay attention. Bree worked hard to prepare this report, but it is hard to focus when I know my opinions don’t matter. Bree makes the decisions for the campaign, and the polls make the decisions for Bree. I hate myself for being so cynical, but I am a politician now. I am just the smiling face on the well-oiled machine.

When Bree started to explain the campaign schedule up through Friday’s debate, I heard something familiar. It sounded like a woman humming in the room next door. Except, in the office at the end of the narrow hallway, there was no room next door. I decided I wasn’t hearing anything.

Bree dictated, “Tomorrow, we have a meeting with Scarnes and Blumph, your publicists.”

*If you’re not feeling happy today…*

The wordless music continued, now coming from both the room that wasn’t next door and behind the professor’s daughter’s desk.

My decision failed me. I was definitely hearing something. I told myself maybe it was an old toy in one of the cardboard boxes that towered in the corner opposite me. I looked up at Bree to see if she heard anything. She reported on without a moment’s hesitation.

“Then on Wednesday we have the meet and greet at the nature center.”

Moving my head as little as possible, I began to dart my eyes around the room. The music was coming from above me now. I thought there might have been an attic there before the renovation.

*Just put on a smiling face…*

I tried my best to look focused. I am always trying my best.

“On Thursday, we have your appearance for seniors at the YMCA.”

I fought to keep breathing, but the air was leaving me. The music, now all around me and getting louder, was almost suffocating. I was drowning in it.

*It’ll make the pain go away…*

My nerves began to demand my body move. First my fingers began to tap the chair’s worn arm. The music grew louder. Then my feet joined in. The music was nearly deafening.

At that, Bree looked up from her papers. For another fleeting moment, she looked at me like a sibling instead of a campaign manager. But this time it was a look of concern instead of affection.

“You good?” Bree’s question was almost drowned out by the song.

“Yeah, yeah. I’m fine. Probably just too much coffee.” I felt like I was shouting, but I know I was using my inside voice.

Almost as scared of Bree’s disappointment as the music from the void, I asked, “Do you hear something?”

The music stopped except for the faint hum from the woman in the room that wasn’t next door.

*Before you forget to say…*

“No.” Bree’s face looked just as I had feared. Worried but not willing to show it.

Silence kindly returned.

With an earnest attempt at earnestness, I pivoted. “And the debate’s Friday?”

“Right…” Bree said as if she were asking herself for permission to continue. “But I’ll do the walkthrough of the venue on Thursday.”

Bree haltingly continued to the financial section of her report, and I remembered. She used to sing the song to me before bed. It is called “Put on a Smiling Face,” and it is from *Sunnyside Square*. I think it was my favorite show as a kid.

I couldn't ask Bree about it. Not with the way she looked at me. But, after I left her office, I texted a few friends. No one remembers it. Does anyone here? The show aired in Mason County in the 90s, and the lullaby was its theme song. I don’t remember anything else right now.

Writing this, I hear the melody starting up from the apartment behind me. I live at the end of the hall.",5,1762440263.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

i'm almost 30 now, diagnosed autistic many years ago. i kinda got a big realization that i'm not getting any younger, my parents aren't getting any younger. and this is the only time i can have with people i love.

i have been avoiding doing anything risky, anything too out of my comfortzone, because well, i get very very upset when things don't go my way, or there's a little change happen in my schedule, so that means i also have been avoiding spending quality time with loved ones.  
  
*and I KNOW ''spending time with loved ones'' doesn't have to be anything that i Don't Want to do. that my loved ones can do my autistic things instead of me having to do their allistic things. but i'm saying like, things that i Do want to do, just too disgusted by the fact that it takes me OFF of my schedule. (annnywway)* 

and it's like on one hand, i get it, being autistic has its awesomeness and positive side, on the other hand, i fucking hate it. i just let pretty much half of my life just slip away because aaahhh change scary!!!! 

these past couple of months, i have been working on just letting things be, everything will fall into its place without me forcing it there. i have less disappointment and rage when things don't go according to plan because i try not to have an expectations on any outcome. or even plan at all. i try to say yes to every invitations (though failed to go to a wedding last week), and it can be very tiring and i get overwhelmed and crazy headaches due to sensory overload. but hmm. i feel satisfied anyway knowing that i have lived that, those big little experiences. even when it was just to get a coffee with mom at the cafe (i usually just order a delivery service)

  
**and this post isn't me saying that every autistics have to do what i do**. i guess i just wanted to share something positive. change IS scary, maybe i no longer see it as ''everything is ruined'' scary and more of a ''roller coaster'' scary. 

  
i hate having anxiety, i hate being depressed as shit my whole life. i hate wanting to control my life so much. autism is both a curse and a superpower to me. i want to ''fuck it, we ball'', i want to ''chill'' and ''let it go''. and i'm working on that now! it may take me nearly 30 years to finally work on that (haha no therapy gang).

it will hurt, it will be exhausting, but i want to go to sleep in the future knowing that i have done something new that day.

literally nothing else about my autism that i hate other than RIGIDITY. 

yeah, i want to spend my entire life taking care of my isopods and watching springtails. but i ALSO want to follow my loved ones to their favourite places before one of us dies. and traveling fucking hurts nothing is worth it, but i now want to be there anyway. (i think they called it YOLO.)

  
*i want to do naughty things like ignore my schedule sometimes (holy shit!!!!!!!!!!!!!)* 

i still do have pangs of anxiety when my rigidity is challenged. but idk, we'll see where this goes ?

my what to do's : 

\-remove ''outcomes'' from brain   
\-fuck it and ball  
\-remind self that things will fall where they're supposed to without me forcing it  
\-find the good in things always  
\-say good morning to people 

  
the difference between ''is this it?'' (disappointment) and ''is this it?!'' (excitement) when watching shit happens. 

  
anyway, live life. smile. keep going, let go. love u all. ",1,1762440168.0,autism,1,1.0,False

1oq0owe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1oq0owe/what_great_parents_and_great_nannies_understand/,What great parents and great nannies understand about each other,"As someone who’s been both a parent and a nanny, I’ve seen things from both sides. Honestly, it’s changed how I see everything about this work.

I know this kind of mutual understanding isn’t always the norm. We’ve all heard the stories… the burnout, the crossed boundaries, the mismatched expectations. But this post is for the *great families and the great nannies* who get it right. The ones who communicate, respect each other, and share the same quiet goal: to raise kind, secure, loved little humans.

What’s something you’ve learned from the other side. The moment that made you think, “Oh… they’re trying their best too”?

Here are a few I believe are true, even when it’s hard to remember in the moment:


——


**What good parents understand about their nanny:**

• **This is a profession, not “babysitting.”** They recognize the training, intuition, and emotional regulation it takes to guide small humans through their day, and treat it with the same respect they’d give any skilled career.

• **Nannies need time to recharge too.** They understand that caring for kids is physically and emotionally demanding, and that small breaks (even five quiet minutes with coffee or a text to their own family) help us show up better for their child.

• **We need space to create our own rhythm with their kids.** The best parents step back and let us find our groove… our inside jokes, our routines, our way of handling tantrums… because they know that’s what builds a secure bond.

• **We carry part of their mental load.** They notice that we’re not just following directions. We’re anticipating needs, prepping snacks, managing moods, and keeping the day moving so their home runs smoother.

• **We’re tuned in to their child’s emotional world.** They value that we pick up on tiny cues… the pre-nap crankiness, the post-separation cling, the moment their baby tries a new skill… and that we respond thoughtfully.

• **We need professional trust.** They know hovering or micromanaging makes it harder to do our best work, and that mutual trust turns childcare into a partnership instead of supervision.

• **We’re not replaceable, even if we’re temporary.** They understand that nannies often love deeply and leave quietly, and that goodbyes can be just as emotional for us as for the children.

• **We give parts of ourselves that can’t be seen.** The patience, self-control, humor, and empathy we use all day don’t always show on paper, but good parents notice.

• **We thrive on appreciation and respect, not gifts or bonuses (though those help too!).** A simple “we’re so grateful for you” or an effort to include us in the family’s rhythm goes a long way.

• **We show up, even when it’s hard.** They know we have our own lives, families, and bad days, but we still show up calm, ready, and steady because consistency matters.


——


**What good nannies understand about their parent employers:**

• **They’re carrying a mental load we can’t always see.** Between work deadlines, meals, pediatrician appointments, and emotional guilt about being away, their minds never fully rest. The exhaustion we see on their faces is layered.

• **That couch moment isn’t laziness. It’s survival.** When they finally sit while we’re on the floor playing, it’s not because they’re “off.” It’s the first quiet breath they’ve had all day.

• **They love their children so fiercely it hurts.** Every instruction, check-in, and overexplained detail usually comes from fear, not control, because these little humans are their entire world.

• **They’re learning to share their most sacred space.** Inviting another adult into your home, to care for your child and witness your routines and imperfections, is deeply vulnerable. It takes trust and courage to do that well.

• **They feel guilt no matter what they choose.** If they work, they feel they’re missing out. If they stay home, they feel unfulfilled or financially strained. Nannies often see that quiet tug-of-war behind the smiles.

• **They crave reassurance too.** Just like we want to know we’re appreciated, parents want to know their kids are safe, loved, and thriving in our care. It helps them breathe easier through their workday.

• **They need consistency as much as their kids do.** A nanny who respects their house rules, follows through, and communicates clearly gives parents the sense of stability they’re desperate for in the chaos of parenting.

• **They’re human before they’re parents.** They make mistakes, lose patience, forget things… just like us. When we offer them the same grace we hope to receive, the whole relationship softens.

• **They’re trying.** Even when they fumble, even when they’re overwhelmed, the parents who show up, reflect, and keep working at it are doing the best they can.


——


**What both sides know deep down:**

• **We’re both trying to build a safe, happy world for the same little human.** Everything else (the routines, the differences) comes second to that shared goal.

• **We both have days where we doubt ourselves.** Parents wonder if they’re doing enough. Nannies wonder if they’re doing it right. The love underneath is the same.

• **We both give pieces of ourselves that go unnoticed.** The patience, the quiet emotional labor, the staying gentle even when we’re tired. We see it in each other more than we realize.

• **We both want to feel trusted and appreciated.** Whether it’s a “thank you” text or a kind word at the door, acknowledgment fuels both roles.

• **We both need boundaries to stay healthy.** Respecting each other’s space - emotional, physical, and professional - keeps the relationship strong.

• **We both experience moments of guilt.** Parents for leaving; nannies for going home. But guilt doesn’t mean we’re doing it wrong. It means we care deeply.

• **We both celebrate the same milestones.** First words, first steps, first big laughs. We all feel that rush of pride.

• **We both grieve when the chapter ends.** Even when it ends kindly, saying goodbye to a shared child feels like closing a sacred book.

• **We both know love isn’t divided… it’s multiplied.** A child who’s deeply loved by both grows stronger because of it. We both love the same little human, just from different angles.

**TL;DR:** Parents and nannies have more in common than they realize. The best of both sides see each other with empathy. We’re all trying to raise kind, secure, loved little humans, and that’s what matters most.",5,1762440071.0,Nanny,3,1.0,False
1oq0o7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1oq0o7t/my_roommates_gourmet_coffee_is_actually_instant/,My Roommate’s ‘Gourmet’ Coffee Is Actually Instant,"**I’ve been secretly replacing my roommate’s fancy coffee with instant coffee for months**

Okay, so this feels weird to admit, but here we go.

My roommate is really, *really* into coffee. Like, pour-over method, freshly ground beans, temperature-controlled kettle kind of into coffee. Meanwhile, I can barely taste the difference between a latte and a cup of instant stuff as long as caffeine exists somewhere inside it.

A few months ago, we ran out of his expensive coffee beans, and he was out of town for a weekend. I panicked because I’d already invited a friend over and promised “artisan coffee.” So I grabbed my jar of instant coffee, put it in a fancy container, and… it worked. My friend loved it. No questions asked.

The thing is, I never stopped.

Every time the fancy jar gets low, I top it up with my instant coffee. My roommate keeps talking about how he “can’t believe how smooth this new blend is” and how the “notes of caramel really come through.” He even recommended it to his friends.

He just ordered a coffee grinder upgrade last week.

And now I feel kind of awful every morning when he sips it with his eyes closed like he’s tasting the sunset on an Italian hillside.

I know I need to tell him eventually… or at least buy actual coffee beans. But every time I try, he starts talking about how his appreciation for specialty coffee has *deepened*, and I just can’t do it.

So yeah. I’ve basically been running a caffeine-based placebo experiment on my best friend, and I don’t know how to stop.",0,1762440021.0,confessions,10,0.24,False

To be fair i’m only on episode 10

Spoilers ahead!!!!

I just think to carry on this lie of pretending to be a boy for the sake of love and for the sake of not being able to admit that you’ve been lying this whole time is messed up. I feel so sorry for Han Kyul he’s having to go through this crisis of realisation that he might be gay for it to all be spun on him to know that he isn’t gay because he’s actually fallen in love with a woman but he seems to think it’s a man. It’s just gonna be so confusing and I feel like that is such a traumatic thing to put someone through. How could she get away with this? How can Eun Chan feel okay with the fact that she’s leading this guy on and realising they’re both got feelings for each other and still playing into the act of pretending to be a boy without confronting the fact that she is not a boy that’s messed up, however you watch I think it’s messed up. You’ve lied to get it to me. I just don’t know how anybody can come back from there. I really don’t because I think it’s so messed up that she’s basically let him on made him have a midlife crisis and thinking all his life we thought it was straight and now he’s coming to realisation that he might be gay and then he’s gonna come to the realisation that he’s not actually straight because the guy that he fought he was falling in love with his actually a girl. I’m sorry if I’m coming across maybe homophobic or dense and not realising that yeah okay this show is fictional show I just honestly think because I love the characters and I think the whole story is cute I still feel sad and that the whole underlying storyline is still messed up and I feel bad for Han Kyul.

She said yes, but the date never happened, and after that, her whole demeanor changed. She went from being talkative and social to becoming quieter, avoiding conversations with most men except for two married coworkers. Before I asked her out, she used to stand in front of me at the train station, often turning around to look at me for five to seven seconds at a time, sometimes even multiple times in one morning. There were stretches where she would walk slightly ahead of me, or even rush to get in front, almost as if she wanted to be noticed.

After I asked her out, though, that changed. She stopped standing in front of me and started positioning herself near where her train car stops. Even so, she continues to look at me sometimes—steady eye contact from across the platform or quick glances when we pass each other. When we make eye contact, her expression softens noticeably, almost as if she drops whatever mask she’s wearing in that moment. There have also been smaller signs—her matching my walking pace, subtly mirroring how I move, or glancing over when I shift direction.

At one point, she seemed to be deliberately lowering her social energy, possibly to match mine since I’m more introverted. It also feels like she might be holding herself back—like she wants to come forward but doesn’t know how. I’ve noticed that she still rides the same train on her usual workdays (Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday). Recently, I’ve chosen to create emotional distance for my own peace of mind. I still acknowledge her presence, but I’ve stopped trying to initiate or read too far into things.

Given everything—her saying yes but never following through, her pulling back socially, the lingering looks, mirroring, and subtle warmth when she’s near me—does this seem more like nervousness or emotional conflict, or is it disinterest masked by politeness? Should I continue to keep that emotional wall up and move on, or leave room for her to possibly reconnect in her own time?",2,1762439628.0,bodylanguage,7,1.0,False
1oq0h48,https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbedroom/comments/1oq0h48/wife_keeps_shifting_goal_posts_for_what_gets_her/,Wife keeps shifting goal posts for what gets her in the mood,"35M and 31F

Not had regular sex for about 4 years. We're currently down to maybe 2 or 3 times a year. We have regular conversations about what we need to do get a bit more intimacy back and everytime she says ""i just want romance""

Which at first, is completely fair, we've been together 8 years, you get comfortable and romance does fade. She tells me her idea of romance is cuddling, kissing, complements, just random acts of affection

So I start making a real conscious effort of doing all of this, bear in mind its only me making that effort, she will rarely initiate anything. On top of all of this, I never stopped doing things for her, I make her coffee every morning, I take her to lunch or dinner at least once a week, I cook for her every night, if she wants anything, clothes, food, various bits for her hobbies, I get them. I don't do these things hoping I'll get laid, I do them because I love her

But when it comes to try and initiate sex ""im not in the mood"" everytime

So eventually I ask again ""what needs to change?"" ""I told you, romance"" i say but I've been trying harder, the other week when I said this she just replied ""well, when was the last time you bought me flowers?"" Despite me spending about £150 on new clothes for her just that morning

But fine, flowers, its true I used to buy her flowers randomly quite a lot. So I buy the flowers, go back to the acts affection. A week later I try to initiate sex ""oh so you only bought me the flowers and gave me affection so you could get sex""

How am I supposed to answer that? Thats not the reason why I did it but I was told by her if I did all these things she would be in the mood for intimacy.

So we have the conversation again ""sometimes I dont want to be asked for sex, I just want you to be a man and take it"" ok fine. Couple days later, I come up behind her, I start kissing her neck, im caressing her. I get a stern ""what are you doing?"" ""What we spoke about..."" then she replies ""you could just cuddle me you know, that would be nice for a change""

Its not like I try for sex every minute of everyday. I actuallt don't bother very much now because there's a 99% chance im going get rejected 

Honestly my gut feeling is she doesn't actually want romance, shes using the romance thing as an excuse to put the lack of sex on me. Its my fault we're not having sex because im not romantic enough.

Maybe im wrong but I just feel like I shouldn't have to jump through so many hoops to have sex with my wife. Im not saying im owed sex or anything like that but shouldn't she **want** to have sex with me at least?

Its really just effected me, i think about sex consistently, I am always horny but at the same time i can't watch porn because as sad and as lame as it sounds, watching people have sex makes me feel insanely jealous, Its getting to the point I can't stand watching TV shows or films where the characters even talk about having sex!",4,1762439553.0,deadbedroom,18,0.67,False

soon after, proposed we try ENM.  I had mixed feelings about it, and I generally need time to process big decisions like that. Unfortunately, she was off and running by the time I decided I didn’t want us to open our marriage.  She would not stop.  She had 2 boyfriends in a month.  She had sex with people, breaking the marriage contract,  when I was still protesting to not be ENM.
It was a very dark time for me those first few months in 2018.  I actually came close to committing suicide once.  My wife went way too fast into ENM and seemed to lack empathy for me.  I even filed for divorce, temporarily.  

And then miraculously we found a great therapist and I also started dating to distract myself from what my wife was doing.  I do love sex. And I was able to get dates and start having sex. I was more into FWB arrangements.  My wife was more into actual romantic relationships.  I had a lot of fun and learned to manage my feelings of jealousy or possessiveness. 

We practiced DADT, which I insisted on.  I’d never want to meet or know about any of her other partners.  She respected it. We both knew what we were doing when we had “plans” on a given night, but we didn’t need to talk about it.  It worked for us.  A year after our tumultuous start into ENM, we had a groove going. 

By the time Covid came around, my wife was disillusioned with ENM.  She found managing extra relationships to be too draining.  She’d neglected platonic friendships or some other aspects of our life.  She and I both had jobs and we had kids, and friends, and hobbies.  Like most people. She found ENM required her to give up some of those things.   

For me however, FWB worked easily.  Low maintenance.  I continued to have fun.  Now here is where DADT was a problem.  She assumed we went back to Monogamy after Covid.   We didn’t formally discuss it.  And yes, I kind of suspected that she thought we were monogamous again.  So I was a shithead badge wearer then, because I kept having sex outside the marriage. But given the cold, rushed way she handled things originally, I felt entitled to my fun. I justified my behavior.  I still don’t feel guilty about it. 

A year ago she found out I was having sex with others. She was upset, but not furious. She said she’d start dating others again. And she did /does. We are right back to the way things were before Covid.   

She sometimes complains of being exhausted after working all day and spending time with her partners afterwards 1-2 times a week.   She neglects her platonic friendships again, also. But she also must be getting something out of her relationships.  But she does sometimes say to me “Dating others sure makes me appreciate you more.”  Meaning the options out there must not be too great. 

For me, I can sometimes have a nooner with a lady that takes an hour and it’s over. It’s pretty easy.  I have different mutual expectation levels with my different partners. With some, I do spend more time with talking and “dating.” And others, we basically meet up and have sex and that’s all. But I do have more time for my platonic friends. 

Would I prefer monogamy now? I think I would. If she came to me and asked to be mono again and commit to it, I would do it.  Mainly so we could see our couple friends more for double dates, etc.  And as we age, I do value my time with my wife more. 

Does this history / account of ENM all sound ideal? I’m sure it doesn’t to many.  My wife and I are close otherwise and I believe in commitment. Marriage can be a battle sometimes.  It isn’t all cakes and unicorns. 
I am proud our marriage has lasted and we enjoy traveling and dancing and working out together. We have a coffee date every morning before work to talk and stay connected. Sex every weekend.  I do adore her.

We lived together for one and even talked about moving away together and planned for marriage. This fall, things just… started falling apart. She got busier, I felt more and more like I was the only one trying.

Back in September, I told her I felt neglected and like it was one-sided. She said she was working seven days a week, completely burnt out, and thought I was just taking space. We met for coffee, talked a bit, but nothing really changed.

On October 2nd, I sent a long message basically saying, “I love you, but I’m unhappy and tired of feeling alone in this.” She replied saying she was “trying baby, I really am, but I feel stretched thin and burnt out… it breaks my heart you feel like you’re in this alone, but I don’t know what else I can do right now.” That ended up being the last message she ever sent me.

I didn’t respond for a week because I didn’t know what to say. Then I texted saying I’d taken some time to think and would like to meet up and talk. The next day was her birthday, so I sent a simple “Wishing you a happy birthday.” She never replied to either. Just left on delivered.

A day later I took down our posts and removed our shared locations. By Oct 20th, she unfollowed me and removed me as a follower, but a few hours later opened that last text from me again, as it said “read”.

In late October my grandma passed away — I didn’t tell her. Now it’s early November and she’s still watching my siblings’ stories from her ig account, even though she unfollowed me on her main. I made my own Instagram public and noticed what might be views from her. My highlights are sayings I’m getting views from a non-follower.

We never actually broke up in person or even said “it’s over.” She just went ghost... After four years together, it’s weird to have no closure and still see traces of her quietly checking in. I haven’t reached out since, chased or anything. I’ve been trying to detach and move on, but part of me keeps wondering what her silence and those story views really mean.

Can anyone with experience in the field provide some insight into this careers work life balance?,"Hey everyone.  Currently, I am a student looking at taking some basic business classes.  Currently, I am done with my gen eds and seriously considering getting my bachelors in accounting.  It's career that I believe would (mostly) be a good fit for me.

While I do enjoy what working in accounting entails, I am worried about the work life balance.  There are endless horror stories on here of people working 70+ hour weeks.  From what I can gather, public accounting will chew you up and spit you out.....especially auditing for one of the big four.  It's making me reconsider my choice to pursue accounting.

Is there a way I can work in the field without selling my soul?  I'd gladly take a 15k-20k pay cut for a standard 40 hour work week.  I do understand that there will be busy times and I'm fine with doing occasional overtime.  I do know myself and working 70+ hours weekly would not be feasible for me in the long term.  Family, friends and my sanity always comes before my career.

I live in a very big city.  From what I've seen on job boards there are plenty of opportunities here for a recent grad.  Has anyone graduated and gone directly into private accounting?  Would it be a better move to start as a book keeper who is paid hourly?

Again, work life balance is one of my top priorities....I'd be ok with not rocketing up the career ladder.  I'm currently working at a coffee shop while going to school.  I make a (surprisingly) comfortable amount of money but am looking for a job that involves actually using my brain.

Any input would be appreciated.  Thank you in advance.",2,1762439174.0,Accounting,10,1.0,False

**What happens:**

* **You get bored. Really bored.** This is the main thing. You'll be standing in line, sitting on the bus, waiting for something to compile, and there's just... nothing.
* **Tasks suddenly seem more appealing.** Daily chores, your task list, old project ideas... When your alternative is staring at a wall, they start looking pretty interesting. You'll find yourself doing things ""for fun"" that you previously considered work.
* **You become more social by default.** When you can't retreat into your phone, you end up talking to people more. Reaching out to old friends, conversations at coffee shops, actually engaging in group settings, random chats with strangers. It just happens because there's nothing else to do.
* **Time moves differently.** Tasks that dragged on for weeks get done in days. Not because you're working harder, but because you're not fragmenting your attention constantly.
* **Your tolerance for boredom increases.** Eventually you get used to just existing without constant input. It's uncomfortable at first, then becomes normal.

**What to fill the time with:**

* **Books.** Obvious, but actually works. Physical books especially - they fill the ""holding something"" habit.
* **Notebooks.** Carry one. Sketch, write thoughts, make lists, whatever. Gives your hands something to do.
* **Podcasts/audiobooks.** For times when you need some input but want to stay present (walking, commuting, chores).
* **Those projects you've been postponing.** Seriously, boredom is a powerful motivator. Clean that closet, organize those files, finally set up that thing.
* **Nothing.** Sometimes just let yourself be bored. Stare out the window. Let your mind wander. It's uncomfortable but valuable.
* **Hobbies that require focus.** Drawing, learning an instrument, cooking, woodworking - things that demand enough attention that you can't think about your phone.
* **Exercise.** Long walks, running, gym time. Fills time and gives you something to do with restless energy.

**The pattern:** You'll be bored → look for literally anything else to do → realize productive/social things are more interesting than nothing → actually do them → repeat.

The boredom is the point. It's not a bug, it's the feature that makes everything else happen.

1oq0ahm,https://tipstor.com/jazz-fueled-adventure-in-new-orleans-usa/,"Jazz-Fueled Adventure in New Orleans, USA","New Orleans doesn’t just play music. It bleeds it. The city hums like a brass horn at midnight, soaked in jazz, sweat, and something electric that never sleeps. The French Quarter glows under flickering gas lamps as the sound of trumpets spills from shadowed doorways, mingling with the scent of fried oysters and powdered sugar. Every corner feels alive, vibrating with rhythm and grease-stained joy.

The real adventure begins when the sun goes down. Bourbon Street might grab the spotlight, but the soul of the city hides in dim-lit jazz clubs where local legends play as if the night itself were on fire. Between sets, the city feeds you like it’s been waiting for you all your life. Po’boy sandwiches stuffed with shrimp or roast beef arrive wrapped in paper, dripping flavor and unapologetic attitude. Gumbo bubbles in cast-iron pots, thick with okra, sausage, and history. A slow-cooked manifesto of Creole pride. And when the clock strikes an hour that most cities reserve for sleep, beignets dusted in snowdrifts of sugar arrive beside chicory coffee that bites back with purpose.

Those who crave more than food find plenty of adventure to burn it off. Kayak tours through the bayou cut through a tangle of moss-draped cypress trees where alligators slide silently beneath the surface. History buffs wander through ghost tours that blur the line between legend and truth. The food tours, though, are their own kind of odyssey. Rolling parades of flavor and friendship where solo travelers become fast allies over bowls of jambalaya and laughter that spills onto the cobblestones.

Spring and fall are the city’s sweet spot. Warm enough for street parades and cool enough to dance through them without melting. Mardi Gras season turns everything into a technicolor fever dream, but even in the quieter months, New Orleans never loses its spark. The place breathes indulgence, resilience, and music that won’t quit.

In this city, food is never just food. It’s the rhythm section of a jazz band, the melody of the streets, the heartbeat of a people who refuse to play anything by the book. New Orleans is not simply visited. It’s consumed, one bite, one riff, one midnight bite of powdered-sugar rebellion at a time.
