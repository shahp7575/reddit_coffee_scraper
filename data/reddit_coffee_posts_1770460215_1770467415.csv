Okay, I need to admit something: I'm a 21-year-old adult who just gasped out loud at *lipstick packaging*. My roommate thought I was watching kitten videos.

Behold: [Flower Knows Cake Lip Cream.](https://benable.com/enchantglow/flowerknow/details?detail_id=19503936)

This thing looks like someone shrunk a Parisian pastry and dipped it in pastel dreams. The ""cake"" base is this soft matte ceramic-feel pot, the ""frosting"" lid has this subtle shimmer finish, and inside? The creamiest, cloud-soft lip tint that smells faintly of vanilla and *happiness*.

I got shade **""Rose Mousse""** — this perfect dusty rose that somehow makes me look like I drink eight glasses of water and journal daily. (I do neither.) It goes on like lip balm, builds like a tint, and leaves this dreamy velvet-matte finish that doesn't crack or settle into lines.

The real magic? **I actually want to reapply it.** Not because I need to — it lasts through my morning coffee and a sad desk lunch — but because pulling this little cake out of my bag sparks *genuine joy*. The barista at my regular spot now asks to see it. My coworkers have started a collection spreadsheet.

Other shades I'm now mildly obsessed with:

* **""Caramel Soufflé""** — warm nude that flatters literally everyone
* **""Berry Parfait""** — deep plum for when you need main character energy
* **""Peach Tart""** — the perfect coral for spring delusion

Fair warning: The packaging is *not* travel-friendly if you're rough with your bags. This is a ""treat it like a tiny ceramic dessert"" situation. But for desk use, photos, and pure aesthetic serotonin? Unmatched.

Flower Knows is a Chinese brand (famous for their whole *dessert meets fairytale* vibe), but they ship globally through authorized retailers. I grabbed mine from [AMAZON](https://benable.com/enchantglow/flowerknow/details?detail_id=19503936) during a sale — think it was around $18-22 USD.

If you're someone who buys books for their covers, collects mugs you'll never use, or believes makeup should spark happiness — this little cake belongs in your collection.

1qycgba,https://www.reddit.com/r/Felts/comments/1qycgba/what_a_beautiful_face_ive_found_in_this_place/,What a Beautiful face I've found in this place,"The door hadn't even clicked shut before the metallic clink echoed from the far corner of the room. A small, olive-drab canister rolled lazily across the warped floorboards, hissing like an angry cat as pale yellow vapor began curling out from its perforated sides.

""Shit—"" Coix reacted first. Years of bad decisions and worse company had drilled certain instincts into him. He kicked the chair backward, snatched the coffee pot off the table mid-pour, and hurled the entire scalding contents at the canister in one fluid, furious motion.

Steam exploded upward as liquid met metal and gas. Bella was already moving too, faster than someone who'd supposedly been dead for two years had any right to be. He yanked a dusty wool blanket from the back of his chair and flung it over the canister like he was smothering a grease fire.

""Window!"" She barked, voice suddenly stripped of its earlier playfulness.

Coix didn't argue. He lunged for the single grimy pane overlooking desert, drove his elbow through the glass, once, twice, then kicked the remaining shards out. Dry desert wind rushed in, thin and hot, pulling some of the vapor with it instead of letting it settle.

The Duo pressed low, shoulders almost touching, breathing through sleeves. The gas wasn't the classic blistering sulfur nightmare; this was something newer, meaner, a bastard Chemist cooked up in some warlord's garage lab. It stung like tear gas on steroids, burned the eyes and throat immediately, but didn't cling or blister right away. More incapacitating than lethal in small doses—designed to scatter rather than slaughter.

Still plenty capable of killing if you sat in it long enough.

Bella coughed once, hard, then muttered through her sleeve, ""Told you this place had character.""

""You absolute lunatic,"" Coix wheezed back. His eyes streamed, the room swam in yellow haze. ""If this is your idea of special–""

""Shut up and help me."" Bella was already dragging a rusted metal cabinet across the floor to block the door. Someone outside rattled the handle, then kicked it once. Wood splintered but held.

Coix joined him, shoving with his shoulder. ""Who the hell did you piss off this badly?""

""Nobody, maybe you're blind but that bastard Grelt wanted to invade here."" Bella flashed that same infuriating grin, even with tears cutting tracks through the dust on his face. ""Figured if I was going to drag my old friend out here better have some entertainment""

The kicking outside stopped. Footsteps retreated—probably to fetch something heavier, or maybe just to wait for the gas to do its work.

Coix glared at his friend. ""You called me here to use me as bait?""

""Collateral damage,"" Bella said cheerfully. ""But look on the bright side: you're still breathing. And now you know I'm alive. That's progress.""

A low, wet cough escaped Coix. The gas was starting to settle in his lungs like hot gravel. ""I'm going to kill you myself when we get out of this.""

""Promises, promises."" Bella fished a small auto-injector from inside her jacket—military-grade, probably stolen—and jabbed it into her own thigh without hesitation, then tossed a second one to Coix. ""Stims the respiratory system, counters the worst of it. Won't feel great, but you'll walk.""

Coix caught it, stared at the label, then drove the needle home anyway. A cold burn raced up his leg, followed by a rush that made his heart slam against his ribs. The burning in his throat eased a fraction.

They crouched by the broken window, listening. 

They slipped through the shattered window one after the other, dropping into desert. Bella paused only long enough to flip the bird at the empty doorway behind them.

""Next reunion,"" Coix growled as they started jogging, ""we're doing it somewhere with actual security. And real coffee.""

Bella laughed—short, hoarse, alive. ""Deal. But only if you admit you missed me.""

Coix didn't answer. He just kept running.",1,1770466946.0,Felts,1,1.0,False

1qycei9,https://i.redd.it/mtmx4z9qe2ig1.jpeg,"Málaga says goodbye to a breakfast institution, El Diamante closes after 77 years","Bar El Diamante has stopped serving breakfasts. Just like that. No noise, no drama, just the quiet clink of packing boxes where there used to be cups of coffee, toasted pitufos and the low murmur of regulars who never needed to look at a menu.

After 77 years in the historic centre of Málaga, one of the city’s most recognisable traditional bars has closed its doors. Francis Cerezo, known to everyone simply as Francis, and his wife Mariví Castillo said goodbye to their customers last Friday. The reason is not a lack of clients, nor rising rents, nor changing fashions, but something much more human, retirement and health.

Francis joined the bar in 1994 at just 22 years old, fresh out of vocational training in electricity. Three years later, following the retirement of the remaining owners, he took over the business. Since then, he has been behind the bar for more than three decades, shaping the final chapter of a story that began in 1949.

Originally opened under the name El Brillante near the Parador de San Rafael, the bar moved to Pozos Dulces after a dispute over rent and was reborn as El Diamante. Time passed, fashions changed, but inside the bar almost nothing did. The marble counter, the shelves of bottles, the original soda machine, even the furniture from the old lechería, all remained. As Mariví likes to say, “Everything is the same. Only the floor outside and the bathrooms were ever changed.”

What made El Diamante special was not nostalgia alone, but consistency. Breakfasts were honest, filling and affordable. A full breakfast with a large café con leche came in at around 3.50 euros. The most expensive pitufo barely reached 2.20. The undisputed star was the strawberry milk, made with milk and strawberry syrup from Bodega Quitapenas, a simple drink that generations of Malagueños grew up with.

Then there was the pitufo de salchichón de Málaga, a breakfast so local it almost feels like a statement of identity. No avocado experiments, no reinterpretations, just bread, product and routine.

The bar survived everything, economic crises, the arrival of franchises, nearby competitors, even the pandemic. When they were forced to close temporarily due to illness or restrictions, a simple WhatsApp status saying “Tomorrow we’re open” was enough to bring the regulars straight back through the door.

That loyalty is now turning into sadness. Customers have cried, complained half-jokingly that they will be “orphaned”, and wondered where they will go next. Social media has filled with messages of thanks and affection. For many, El Diamante was not just a place to eat, but part of their daily rhythm.

There is still a small hope. A possible generational handover, perhaps within the family, perhaps reopening later this month. But nothing is guaranteed, and even if the bar returns, the prices, the breakfasts and the spirit may not.

For now, Málaga loses another of its quiet, unpretentious landmarks. Not a trendy spot, not an Instagram favourite, but something far rarer, a place that simply did its job well, every morning, for nearly eight decades.

At oldtownmalaga.com, we believe stories like this matter. Because understanding Málaga is not only about monuments and museums, but about bars where time stood still, and where a simple breakfast could feel like home.",1,1770466784.0,VisitMalaga,0,1.0,False
1qyce9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1qyce9k/what_should_i_do_about_my_extremely_noisy/,What should I do about my extremely noisy neighbors?,"So I (27F) have been living in a rental appartement for over 5y now. The house next door is owned by an elder couple (+\\-55yo) and their kitchen is next to my bedroom.

Over the last few years I’ve tried to talk to them for over 5 times about the noise coming from a coffee machine which is placed directly beside my bed. They tend to drink a lot of coffee, starting at 6:30 in the morning, and it wakes me up almost everyday. 

They’re also really really noisy with slamming kitchen cabinets etc, but I get that it’s not possible to change the whole kitchen lay out just because I’m annoyed by the slamming cabinets. 

However, the first time I tried to talk to them I went by their house and kindly asked if we could maybe talk about their coffee machine, they said no and closed the door.

The second and third time they just didn’t open the door, and the fourth time they said “that’s a pitty” and slammed the door in my face.

After that I wrote them a letter explaining that since I’m chronically ill I spend a lot of time at home and that it would really help me if they would just move the coffee machine just a tiny bit. No reply.

A few months ago I’ve send another letter. They were doing some construction work starting at 6 in the morning (which is not allowed in my city) and they kept on drilling the entire day which made it impossible for me to follow my classes online. 

I went to google and discovered that there their is a mediator in my neighborhood if it’s not possible to talk directly to your neighbor and that if they keep annoying you you’re allowed to call the neighborhood police to mediate as well. 

I decided that I would give them one last change to talk to me about it in a civil way and if they keep ignoring me I would find a mediator.

So I’ve send them a letter explaining that I really want to talk to them and that if they don’t reply to me I will find a mediator or call the neighborhood police to mediate. 

A few weeks later I got a call from my elderly landlord, he live beneath me, and he said that the neighbors came to him to say that I was harassing them and complained about me asking for a conversation.

I found this really disturbing since I’m an adult and I’ve been asking to talk as adults and their reaction to that is to go to my landlord and complain about me asking to talk. 

I don’t know what to do now. My landlord said to leave it alone and not cause a big fight over something so small. But I’m so disturbed by the noise their making especially in the morning or late at night and I’m 100% it’s too loud of decibel to be considered mild disturbing. 

Obviously the neighbors don’t see me as an adult who they can have a conversation with and rather complain about me to my landlord who has nothing to do with this. 

But I’m afraid if I continue the plan by looking for a mediator they will go to my landlord again and I end up in a fight with my landlord.

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",2,1770466591.0,AwesomeReps,2,1.0,False

The Christmas market stall that sell coffees flavoured with Bailey’s or Mint Choc Chip for example, though have different processes in their production end up with the same product of adulterated coffee. 

And then people who put syrups in their coffees, could they be more purists of coffee enjoyment than even those who brew a co-ferment strawberry anoxic natural thermal shock that tastes far further removed from the taste of “coffee” than you’d get from the cindering remains of a Starbucks?

1qyc3w5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qyc3w5/every_time_you_get_paid_do_this_kevin_olearys/,"Every Time You Get Paid, Do THIS: Kevin O'Leary's Science-Backed Wealth Trick ($0 Required)","I used to think building wealth meant grinding harder. Working overtime, side hustles, sacrificing sleep. Then I stumbled across Kevin O'Leary's payment day strategy while researching wealth psychology from investors, behavioral economists, and personal finance experts. It completely flipped how I approach money. The wild part? Most people never learn this because our education system teaches us jack shit about financial literacy. We're conditioned to earn and spend, not earn and multiply. But here's the thing: you can change that pattern with one simple habit the moment your paycheck hits.

# 1. Pay yourself first (but not how you think)

The second money hits your account, move 10-20% into a separate savings or investment account. Not at the end of the month. Not after bills. Immediately.

O'Leary calls this ""paying Mr. Wonderful"" and honestly, it's the most unglamorous wealth building hack that actually works. Most people pay everyone else first (landlord, Netflix, student loans) then ""save what's left."" Spoiler: there's never anything left.

The psychology behind this is simple. When money disappears before you can mentally spend it, you adjust your lifestyle around what remains. Your brain doesn't miss what it never ""had.""

Set up automatic transfers for the same day as payday. Treat it like a non-negotiable bill. Within 6 months you'll have built a financial cushion without feeling the pinch. Within 5 years? You've got serious capital.

**Book rec**: *The Wealthy Barber* by David Chilton. This book sold over 2 million copies and basically broke down exactly how ordinary people build extraordinary wealth through this one principle. Chilton makes finance feel like you're chatting with a smart friend over coffee, not sitting through an economics lecture. The ""pay yourself first"" framework he presents will genuinely rewire how you see money. Best personal finance book I've read, hands down.

# 2. Make your money work harder than you do

O'Leary is obsessed with cash flow. Every dollar should generate more dollars. Once you've saved a decent amount, start investing it. Index funds, dividend stocks, REITs, whatever matches your risk tolerance.

The goal isn't to become a day trader. It's to create passive income streams that compound over time. Even $100/month invested with 8% average returns becomes $150k in 30 years. That's the power of compound interest that Einstein supposedly called the eighth wonder of the world.

Start small. Most investing apps now have zero minimums. Wealthfront, Betterment, or even Robinhood for beginners. Just start. The biggest mistake isn't picking the wrong investment, it's never investing at all.

**App rec**: Acorns. This app rounds up your purchases to the nearest dollar and invests the spare change automatically. Sounds gimmicky but it's insanely effective for people who struggle with investing discipline. You're essentially investing without thinking about it. Before you know it, you've got a few thousand dollars working for you.

# 3. Track every single dollar (yes, every one)

O'Leary tracks his spending obsessively. Not because he's cheap, but because awareness creates control. Most people have zero clue where their money actually goes. They just know they're always broke.

Spend one month tracking everything. Coffee, subscriptions, impulse Amazon purchases, everything. You'll be shocked at how much leaks out on stuff you don't even value.

Then cut the fat. Not the things you genuinely love, but the mindless spending that adds zero happiness to your life. Redirect that money into investments or debt payoff.

**App rec**: YNAB (You Need A Budget). This isn't just expense tracking, it's a whole philosophy around giving every dollar a job. The interface takes a minute to learn but once you do, it's genuinely life changing. Users report saving an average of $600 in their first two months. The app costs money but pays for itself immediately.

# 4. Build multiple income streams early

O'Leary didn't get wealthy from one source. He had businesses, investments, royalties, and TV income. The average millionaire has 7 income streams.

You don't need to start 7 businesses tomorrow, but think beyond your day job. Freelance skills, rental income, dividend stocks, online courses, whatever. The goal is to create redundancy so you're never dependent on a single income source.

This also gives you negotiation power at work. When you're not desperate for the paycheck, you can make career moves from a position of strength not fear.

Start with one additional stream. Even an extra $500/month completely changes your financial trajectory over a decade.

**Resource rec**: *The Millionaire Fastlane* by MJ DeMarco. DeMarco tears apart the ""get rich slow"" mentality and argues for building scalable businesses and income streams. It's controversial, kinda aggressive, but insanely good if you're tired of the traditional financial advice that keeps you mediocre. The book won't tell you to clip coupons. It'll tell you to think bigger and build assets that actually scale.

# 5. Eliminate bad debt aggressively

O'Leary hates bad debt (credit cards, car loans, anything that doesn't generate income). Good debt builds wealth (mortgages, business loans). Bad debt destroys it.

If you're carrying credit card balances, attack them with everything you've got. The interest rates are predatory, often 18-25%. No investment will reliably beat that, so paying off high interest debt IS your best investment.

Use the avalanche method: pay minimums on everything except the highest interest debt, then demolish that one. Once it's gone, roll that payment into the next highest. Momentum builds fast.

The mental freedom from being debt free is worth more than the math suggests. You sleep better. You stress less. You make better decisions.

# 6. Invest in skills that pay forever

O'Leary constantly emphasizes that your earning ability is your greatest asset. The more valuable your skills, the more you can charge.

Invest in courses, certifications, coaching, books, anything that increases your market value. A $2,000 course that helps you negotiate a $10,000 raise is a 5x return in year one alone.

Focus on high income skills: sales, copywriting, coding, project management, data analysis. Skills the market actually rewards, not just stuff that sounds interesting.

Your income potential isn't fixed. It's a skill you can develop like any other. Treat your career like a business and yourself as the product.

**Platform rec**: Coursera or Udemy for affordable skill building. Coursera partners with actual universities (Stanford, Yale, Google) so you're getting legit education for a fraction of the cost. Courses on financial modeling and negotiation can directly increase income. Udemy is hit or miss quality wise but during sales you can grab courses for like $15 that are genuinely valuable.

Another tool worth checking out is BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app developed by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers. Type in any skill or goal, like becoming better at negotiation or understanding investment psychology, and it generates personalized audio podcasts pulled from books, research papers, and expert interviews. You control the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. What makes it different is the adaptive learning plan it builds around your specific goals and struggles, kind of like having a structured roadmap that evolves as you progress. There's also a virtual coach you can chat with for recommendations or clarifications while listening. Makes fitting learning into commutes or workouts way easier.

The system isn't designed to make you wealthy. It's designed to keep you comfortable enough to keep working but never comfortable enough to stop. O'Leary's approach isn't revolutionary, it's just disciplined. Pay yourself first, invest consistently, track ruthlessly, diversify income, kill bad debt, and never stop learning. These aren't secrets, they're just actions most people refuse to take because they require short term sacrifice for long term gain. But if you implement even half of these strategies, you'll be in the top 10% financially within a decade. Not because you worked harder, but because you worked smarter with what you already have.",1,1770465831.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770465603.0,AcBuy,2,1.0,False

I offer when I want to do something for someone. My offer means, I'm going to feel joy by doing this. I have offered in the past before, under duress. Trust me, it's going to feel very different to the person receiving the offer who is probably someone who guilted or somehow obligated me to make the offer. 

My husband just saw I was awake and said 'do you want coffee?' I said yes. He then proceeded to do a million other things before starting the pot to brew. I'm not upset. This isn't about that. It was nice of him to offer and he is making it. 

But I don't understand why people offer things they don't want to do. I didn't signal I wanted coffee so he's not making it out of feeling obligated. I wouldn't have asked him to make it, if I wanted it that bad I'd make it myself.

1qybzfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qybzfh/the_wishing_well/,The Wishing Well,"The Wishing Well appears when you’ve stopped pretending. When the excuses have run out. When even self-pity feels pathetic. When it appears, it does only for you, somewhere inconspicuous like a park, an old road, or at the basement of your home. Someone could walk past it a dozen times and they wouldn’t notice. But to you, in that instant, the air thickens. It presses against your skin, seeps into your lungs. You might hear the faintest hum or a whistle coming from the well. It'll never tell you to approach. It waits. Always waits. After all, it's the only place left for you to go.

The rules are not that complicated, but I've seen far too many cases where a person messes it all up by breaking them. So here they are.

**1. Approach alone.** Others cannot perceive it. Their eyes will slide past it as if it were invisible. And please, don't try to force someone to see it. I remember the case of a particularly depressed teenager who'd noticed the well and thought he was hallucinating. He had been diagnosed with schizophrenia but he was on his meds. He tried to verify it with his sister because he thought his meds weren't working, and that didn't go well. The well is meant for you, and if you have someone else forcefully perceive it they might get irreparable mental damage.

**2. Offer a tribute.** Not money, not anything material, not the things you wish you could throw away. Something precious. Something that leaves a hollow in your chest when it is gone. Memories, objects, mementoes of someone long past.  Nothing that you wanna discard. Negative emotion is like poison to the well.

Human sacrifices have been noted to work exceptionally well, but the rule about negative emotions is even stronger in this. The recoil will be bad. At best, you'll never see the well again. At worst, the well dweller might get angry. You don't wanna see that.

**3. Speak only your wish**. If you try to be too precise, the well will grant the wish—but sometimes not as you imagined. It'll try to fight back. Vagueness is just as bad. The well twists outcomes into cruel distortions. Just try to hit that sweet spot, or be so precise that the well can't find a loophole. Another way to prevent a distorted result is the quality of tribute. It always appreciates good offerings, and it'll show its gratitude in this step.

**4. It may wait.** Minutes, hours, days. Be patient. If you go outside a certain radius, it'll disappear. It's testing your desperation. I think it gets some kind of sadistic pleasure out of that.

**5. Six months.** Once the wish is granted, the tribute is only a down payment. You have six months to deliver the rest. Time stretches. It bends. Each day becomes heavier than the last. The price is never low. Try to pay it back.

**6. Nothing else matters.** Precision is survival. Timing is living. You may think my instructions are reliable. Perhaps. But try to think on your own head. It'll try to trick you every step of the way. Be wary of that and be cleverer than it.

I have a few cases for you, so you know even better what not to do. The first is Aaron Paulson, who found it behind a shuttered strip mall. Bankruptcy had hollowed him out. The office smelled of stale coffee, burnt paper, and wet carpet. His fingers trembled as he sorted letters and notices, the edges of each sheet sharp against his skin. He'd offered a tribute carefully chosen: the guilt of abandoning a mentor, the man who had guided him, trusted him, taught him everything. He'd drawn him there and pushed him down.

The well accepted it slowly, savoring every ounce of regret. Within a week, his debts vanished. Errors corrected themselves. Partners and benefactors appeared in plenty. Aaron thrived. Like I said, the well always appreciates good tribute.

Then the countdown began. Days stretched. Each sunrise felt duller. Every step, every breath, reminded him that six months had begun. And when the time was up, he could not bring himself to pay. The well left—and Aaron’s world collapsed in ways the well had anticipated: contracts vanished, employees resigned, investments turned to dust. That was just the beginning, though. The well-dweller hates unpayed debts more than anything else. It came for him. They say he was attacked by a vicious bear while trying to run from it in the forest. We know better.

Anna found it outside a fertility clinic. She gave a memory: her mother’s voice, soft and protective, the lullaby that had steadied her heart for decades. The well drank it slowly. It cherished the tribute, and she forgot everything about her mother.

She asked for a child. She got one.

Then the six-month countdown began. The well demanded that she leave the child. Not kill it, not give it back. She had to abandon her family. She could not release the attachment. When the six months ended, the well left—and Anna’s world collapsed. They say it was a fire. Her house was consumed by it, burning her family away before help could arrive.

The game is not simple. Every wish is layered. Everythings a trap. You may believe what I write here. But perhaps the rules will bend for you. Perhaps they won't. Perhaps the very act of reading this, is the first move in a game of chess you will never winy.

I have watched them all. Aaron. Anna. Daryl. Glenn. Rick. Others whose names I have long since forgotten. I have catalogued their choices, their failures. I type this now from the the well. Stones press beneath my fingertips, cold and damp. The reception down here is so terrible. It took me *hours* to fucking post this.

Oh, look! A new visitor approaches. Her heartbeat is ragged, breath even shallower. I just can't wait to devour all that juicy tribute. I want her hope, her guilt. All for me.

Good luck with the Wishing Well. You can play the game with me, or you can hear more of this story if you want. Perhaps next time I'll tell you how I got stuck down here. Until then, goodbye, reader.",3,1770465443.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I always thought it was just a layer of foam on top of espresso, something that looked nice but did not really matter. Then I started noticing how much people talk about it and I realized I had no idea what it actually meant.
Once I began reading more, crema started to feel like a small window into the whole espresso process. Bean freshness, grind size, pressure and even the machine itself all seem to affect it. Sometimes I get a thick, golden layer aand for other time it is barely there. even when I think I did everything the same. That it made me curious rather than frustrated.
What ! surprised me most is how easily crema can be misunderstood. Some people treat it like a quality guarantee, while others say it does not mean much at all. I went through forums, watched slow detailed videos, and even ended up browsing Alibaba out of curiosity to see how espresso machines and grinders are described at the manufacturing level. It made me realize how many variables exist behind a single cup.
Now I wonder how many coffee drinkers notice crema but never really question it. Does ? it actually change how the coffee tastes for you.  And when you pull a shot without much crema  do you see it as a failure or just part of the process?

Bringing commercial grinders into a home isn’t about efficiency.

It’s about mass, rotational stability, and motor headroom — all of it ending up in the grind.

The R-750’s slow, steady rotation produces clean, low-fines particles.

The CN-2’s conical burrs create density and viscosity in the cup.

Neither of these machines is about speed. They grind with margin.

When I talk about this in Japan, no one really gets it.

People say it’s overkill.

That home grinders are “good enough.”

1qybvbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_weakherorin/comments/1qybvbr/am_i_unable_to_love/,am i unable to love?,"hello. 

i have no idea how to even begin to describe what i’m going through right now and i feel so strange turning to reddit but i am at an all time low i think. 

for as long as i can remember i have ‘fallen in love’ with people and its so so obsessive when it happens. 

i want them to be mine. truly mine. 

i go through their followers, their likes, spotify playlists and get in my head about them wanting someone else, lusting for other women. i would have panic attacks about previous partners flirting with coworkers out of boredom and even read through their journals at times and upset myself over their PAST relationships despite having my own past. i am unwell to say the least. 

anyways, despite all of this, im not sure ive ever actually been in love with any of these people. i think im just obsessed. it kills me to think about them. 

when i’m with them everything is fine but when we’re apart my brain just self destructs. 

at the time i think im in love but slowly i become bored and pissed off at the sight of them and grow resentful at them wanting to be with me even though that’s what i wanted before. 

it is a pattern for me. fall for them, want them to need me and then hate them for it. 

in between the growing restful towards them process, i am occupying myself with a new interest. something else to focus on and put all my attention to. 

i move on before i leave the relationship. 

in my previous relationship, i was so into this girl and very unhealthily obsessed and attached. 

i needed her all the time. wanted her around all the time. 

i hated when she would be busy with friends or family and would spiral (i have bipolar disorder so i would be triggered often during a relationship and have awful episodes)

i met this boy and immediately we became friends but i expected no more than that. we spoke for a couple of weeks and i’ll admit we were definitely flirty at times but i thought it was just friendly or being funny. 

when we hung out for the first time in person he wrapped his arm around me while we shared a bench and he traced his thumb against my hand. 

i understood then that i had the opportunity to be romantic with him and after that point the flirting became a lot more intense and intentional. 

we are great friends and i am his best friend, but we also have a sexual relationship. 

at first we would have sleepovers and kiss a little and just lay naked together. 

he finds intimacy difficult and until me had not participated in sexual activity for a number of years. 

the more we got to know each other, the more comfortable he became etc. 

so, we have a sexual relationship now. 

sexting, nudes, videos, oral stuff and actual sex. 

since we became friends six month ago, we have had a sort of ‘friends with benefits’ relationship but are actual friends that care about each other and are totally happy just being friendly and catching up for coffee and stuff, the sexual aspect is not needed and is just a bonus! yippie!

i am attracted to him as a person, he is good looking and very smart and his personality and the way he carries himself is just hot. he is so so lovely too. so sweet. 

i accidentally in the heat of an emotional moment, told him i liked him and made things a bit messy. 

now he doesn’t think it’s a good idea to have a sexual relationship and should just be strictly friends that talk here and there and hangout because up until this point we have been definitely closer than the standard friends with benefits relationship. 

talking everyday, exchanging gifts over christmas (he got me something and i didn’t so then i made him a gift)

cuddling in bed, cuddling naked, showering my face and body in gentle kisses, kissing my forehead and tracing along my shoulders and back gently. sleeping with his arms wrapped around me, his head resting on mine. 

holding hands in bed, holding my hands or resting his hands on my shoulders while we go down the escalator.

holding me tight when we’re on a busy tram because i can’t reach the monkey bar-like things to keep myself stable while it moves. 

our conversations until late where he tells me i’m his best friend and that he wishes i was at his house rn so we could cuddle to sleep or watch tv, that he likes holding my hand and that he misses me. 

we’re too close. 

still, i told him i liked him and he said he does not feel the same and that we should just be friends. 

i broke down about it and we have been taking a bit of a break from talking. 

he’s all i can think about. my every waking thought. 

literally, the second i open my eyes in the morning im thinking about him. replaying our good days and how it ended. wishing i could’ve kept my mouth shut. 

wanting things to go back to how they were. 

thinking of ways i can get him to want me. 

i’ve even taken up praying to god to give him back to me and have read into tarot cards and looked at the stars and what they mean right now, the moon and witchcraft. 

his star sign and what he needs, how he loves and his compatibility with me. 

i am insane. i have no idea what’s going on. 

i’ve never gotten to this point before but have definitely never been normal about a person of interest before. 

yet despite all of this i have no idea if im in love with him or not. if ive ever been in love with anybody. 

i hate the idea of him seeing anybody else, hate thinking about his past relationships with girls (he’s had one girlfriend, lost his virginity to her at 19 and they dated for 2 months so it’s not like it was a big deal but it is to me) he’s slept with 4 people in total and it just crushes me. 

i know something so wrong with me, many things infact and im not asking anybody to solve these issues i just want someone to tell me if they’ve ever related maybe? 

what happened, how did you recover? what helped you get through it or over them? did you ever find out if it was love? have you loved since? how are they different?

i know this is poorly written but im so overwhelmed and just want this off of my chest so badly that ive written it as quickly as i can and with whatever comes to mind so please bear with me. 

if this gets any response i am happy to provide further information and answer any questions.

1qybuog,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qybuog,I need help,"Hi everyone,

I am a complete beginner with espresso and I am struggling a lot to get a decent result. I would really appreciate some advice, because at this point I am not sure what I am doing wrong or what my main limiting factor is.

My setup:

	•	La Pavoni Professional lever machine (early 2000s)

	•	CLOER 7520 grinder (conical burr grinder)

What is happening:

No matter what I try, my espresso comes out very watery and thin. Even visually it looks weak. The crema is very light and disappears quickly.

I have tried:

	•	Using less coffee

	•	Using more coffee

	•	Adjusting my tamping

	•	Slower lever movement

	•	Longer preinfusion

None of this really fixed the problem.

Grinder issue:

I have now reached the finest possible setting on my grinder. It is already at the maximum fineness, and I cannot make a clearly noticeable adjustment anymore. Even at this finest setting, the water still flows through quite easily and the shot is watery. Reducing the dose made it even worse.

Puck observation:

After the shot, the puck looks rather dry on top and not fully soaked. It does not look evenly saturated to me. I am not sure how a puck should ideally look, but mine definitely does not appear fully extracted.

Lever feel:

The lever does not feel especially hard to push. It feels relatively easy, which makes me think there is not enough resistance in the puck.

Temperature and technique:

I preheat the machine and do a blank shot. Then I pull the lever up, let it preinfuse for several seconds, and press down slowly. Still, the result is very watery.

My suspicion:

At this point I am wondering if my grinder is simply not capable of grinding fine enough for espresso, especially for a lever machine like the La Pavoni. I am not sure if there is still something I can improve technique wise, or if I have reached the limit of my equipment.

I would be very grateful for any feedback on:

	•	How the puck should ideally look after extraction

	•	Whether a dry puck points clearly to under extraction

	•	Whether my grinder could realistically be the main problem

	•	Any beginner mistakes I might be overlooking with a La Pavoni

Thanks a lot for your help. I am feeling quite frustrated, but I really want to learn and improve.",2,1770464997.0,LaPavoniLovers,3,1.0,False
1qybujf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qybujf,[Haul] 3 weeks of real wear: 8 pieces that actually lived with me,"After subway commutes, spilled coffee, and one rainy Tuesday that tested everything—I’m sharing exactly how these held up. Zero brand ties. Just honest notes.

Off-White x Nike Air Jordan 1 Low
Heel arrow catches platform light just right. Lost the zip-tie lace lock by day five—minor hassle, but wearing the remaining one loose feels more me now.

Nike Air Jordan 1 Low ""Pine Green""
Velvet upper shrugged off a cold brew splash. Wiped clean with a napkin. Swapped to red laces for weekend hangs—quiet refresh.

Balenciaga Logo Spray Hoodie
Fabric softened nicely after washes. Hood depth saves bad hair days. Red stripe under logo? Barely visible unless someone’s close—intentional subtlety.

Off-White Industrial Zip Hoodie
Drawstrings faded slightly, looks naturally broken-in. Silver arrow on back caught store light during a late-night errand. Clerk nodded. Felt good.

AMIRI Distressed Hoodie
Held up through a packed show. Checked the tears afterward—stitching intact. Distressing feels earned, not fragile.

Chrome Hearts Cross Hoodie
Heavyweight cotton = zero chill waiting for the train. Embroidered crosses have subtle texture. Ran my thumb over them while waiting—oddly grounding.

Balenciaga Flame Print Jeans
Wide leg hides lazy days. Print softened noticeably after two washes (I prefer the muted look now, but heads up if you want bold graphics). Do not bike in these—fabric doesn’t give where it counts.

Hellstar Track Pants
""30"" on the side glows faintly in dark hallways. Found my keys faster last night. For the price? Thoughtful detail that lands.

I’m working on a coffee startup called **SNIP**, and I wanted to get the community's thoughts before we pull the trigger on our first production run.

**The Problem:** Most coffee in India is either instant powder (full of sugar/fillers) or liquid decoctions that come in messy tear-away plastic sachets. Plus, that ""caffeine crash"" is real.

**The Solution:** We are launching liquid coffee concentrates in **Snap Packs** (one-handed, fold-and-squeeze tech). No mess, fits in your wallet, and takes 2 seconds to mix.

**The ""Healthy"" Edge:** We’re not just selling caffeine. Our first blend is infused with **EGCG** (for that calm, focused energy without the jitters) and a **Nootropic blend** to help with deep work and focus.

**Why I’m here:** I want to validate if this is something you’d actually use.

* Would you switch your morning brew for a nootropic-infused liquid snap?
* What’s one ""functional"" benefit you wish your coffee had? (Focus? Anxiety relief? Metabolism?)

I'm currently finalizing a build for a 2026 RAV4 Hybrid XLE Premium and I'm stuck on whether to add the Advanced Technology Package (approx. $650). Since it forces me to bundle it with the Weather Package and requires the Moonroof, I want to know if the tech itself is actually useful or just annoying.

I have a few specific questions for those who have these features on the 26 models:

1. The ""Ghost"" Feature (Safe Exit Alert?)

I noticed a discrepancy between the spec sheet and the online builder. The specs list 4 functions, but the builder shows 5.

I suspect Safe Exit Alert might have been moved to a standard safety feature for 2026?

Has anyone confirmed if Safe Exit Alert is now standard on the XLE Premium without this package?

2. Traffic Jam Assist (TJA) - The Subscription Trap?

TJA seems cool for stop-and-go traffic, but does it require an active Drive Connect (5G) subscription to work?

I don't want to pay $650 for a feature that becomes a ""brick"" if I stop paying the monthly subscription fee after the trial period.

3. Driver Monitor Camera - Helpful or Annoying?

This is my biggest hesitation. Does the Driver Monitor just add noise?

Will it beep at me every time I check my side mirrors, look at the GPS, or take a sip of coffee? If it's too sensitive, I'd rather not pay extra to be nagged.

4. Real-world Utility (FCTA & LCA)

Front Cross Traffic Alert (FCTA): This actually seems useful for pulling out of blind driveways.

Lane Change Assist (LCA): Seems nice for long highway road trips.

The Verdict?

For those who have it: Is it worth the extra $650? Or should I just stick with the standard TSS 4.0 and save the cash?

To solve this statistical imbalance, I propose a highly scientific social experiment:

No pressure, no awkwardness — just arrive with an open mind, good vibes, and the willingness to prevent future February 14th complaints about “all the good ones being taken.”

Think of it as pre-Valentine’s Day preventive maintenance.

I don’t have a smart home yet but I do have a 4K Apple TV with Ethernet that can function as a hub.  I also own an iPhone 16, iPad 11 and Apple Watch 9, if that’s relevant. I have some experience with shortcuts and automations.

My goal is to create a smart home that helps manage my ADHD.  Specifically, I want:

1) My lights to turn on and my dumb coffee machine and dumb radio (has Bluetooth and WiFi) to start when I turn off my alarm in the morning. I think this is achievable.

2)  More importantly, I want Siri or Apple Intelligence to SPEAK to me at specific times or triggers, like at 6 a.m., when I arrive at home or when a focus mode activates. I don’t want to have to manually activate Siri. This is crucial.

When it speaks to me, I’d like it to:

\- In the morning, provide an overview of my day: Give me a sleep summary from my watch, weather information, scheduled events from my calendar and any reminders due today.

\- When Work Focus turns on, it should tell me my work reminders.

\- When Fitness Focus activates, after confirmation, it should start my scheduled Fitness+ session on my Apple TV.

\- (these are just some examples)

Bonus points if it were interactive / if I would be able to respond and trigger further actions.

\- For example, if Siri said, “You’ve planned to vacuum the living room at 5 p.m. today,” I could say, “I don’t have time for this. Please postpone it to tomorrow.” And then it would do it.

\- Siri could ask me every hour or so what I’m doing and log my verbal response in a note. At the end of the day, it could tell me how I spent my time.

\- This would be the ultimate feature: If Siri could detect patterns and suggest actions based on them. For example, “You had three household reminders due today but only managed to complete one. Perhaps you didn’t have enough energy today since you only slept three hours. I suggest you go to bed earlier and start with the highest priority task X tomorrow. I can break it down into smaller steps if you prefer.”

Is this technically achievable? I know I’ll likely need shortcuts and automations but I’m curious about the feasibility from a technical standpoint. ",2,1770464356.0,HomeKit,0,0.75,False

Off-White x Nike Air Jordan 1 Low
Heel arrow catches platform light just right. Lost the zip-tie lace lock by day five—minor hassle, but wearing the remaining one loose feels more me now.

Nike Air Jordan 1 Low ""Pine Green""
Velvet upper shrugged off a cold brew splash. Wiped clean with a napkin. Swapped to red laces for weekend hangs—quiet refresh.

Balenciaga Logo Spray Hoodie
Fabric softened nicely after washes. Hood depth saves bad hair days. Red stripe under logo? Barely visible unless someone’s close—intentional subtlety.

Off-White Industrial Zip Hoodie
Drawstrings faded slightly, looks naturally broken-in. Silver arrow on back caught store light during a late-night errand. Clerk nodded. Felt good.

AMIRI Distressed Hoodie
Held up through a packed show. Checked the tears afterward—stitching intact. Distressing feels earned, not fragile.

Chrome Hearts Cross Hoodie
Heavyweight cotton = zero chill waiting for the train. Embroidered crosses have subtle texture. Ran my thumb over them while waiting—oddly grounding.

Balenciaga Flame Print Jeans
Wide leg hides lazy days. Print softened noticeably after two washes (I prefer the muted look now, but heads up if you want bold graphics). Do not bike in these—fabric doesn’t give where it counts.

Hellstar Track Pants
""30"" on the side glows faintly in dark hallways. Found my keys faster last night. For the price? Thoughtful detail that lands.

I’m working on a coffee startup called **SNIP**, and I wanted to get the community's thoughts before we pull the trigger on our first production run.

**The Problem:** Most coffee in India is either instant powder (full of sugar/fillers) or liquid decoctions that come in messy tear-away plastic sachets. Plus, that ""caffeine crash"" is real.

**The Solution:** We are launching liquid coffee concentrates in **Snap Packs** (one-handed, fold-and-squeeze tech). No mess, fits in your wallet, and takes 2 seconds to mix.

**The ""Healthy"" Edge:** We’re not just selling caffeine. Our first blend is infused with **EGCG** (for that calm, focused energy without the jitters) and a **Nootropic blend** to help with deep work and focus.

**Why I’m here:** I want to validate if this is something you’d actually use.

* Would you switch your morning brew for a nootropic-infused liquid snap?
* What’s one ""functional"" benefit you wish your coffee had? (Focus? Anxiety relief? Metabolism?)

1qybli8,https://v.redd.it/40uz3f6u62ig1,How Benares dynasty commissioned North India’s greatest Ramayana paintings,"The popularity of Ram, the ideal god-king, rises in times of political churn in India. The 1700s were no exception. Though Benares was most holy to Shiva, the ruling Narayan dynasty were great devotees of Ram. The Ramcharitmanas was, to them, the ideal text: it depicted Shiva as a devotee of Ram, and Ram as a devotee of Shiva reconciling Benares’ two most powerful religious strands. Patronising the Ramcharitmanas was guaranteed to bring popular acclaim.

When the Ramcharitmanas was first composed in the 1500s, the idea of telling Ram’s story in the vernacular was not popular at all. Tulsidas, its creator, was snubbed by the city’s conservative Shaivite Brahmins. In her introduction to Book of Gold: The Kanchana Chitra Ramayana of Banaras, the late art historian Kavita Singh quotes one of his verses: “Some call me a fool, some call me a sage, some call me a [high-caste] Rajput, some a [low-caste] weaver… I don’t need to ruin anyone’s status by associating with them. Everyone knows I am the slave of Ram… if I need to, I’ll beg for my food and sleep in a mosque.” The booming Benares of the 1700s, home to many Vaishnavite ascetics, instead welcomed the Ramcharitmanas with open arms. Unlike Valmiki’s Ramayana, its Awadhi language made it instantly accessible to all the city’s castes and people.

And so, the Narayan court hosted Ramcharitmanas scholars and developed a lavish Ramlila performance that lasted for weeks at a time. (It continues in Benares to this day). Completely sidelined by the British, the Narayans reached out to all their contemporaries, inviting artists to create the first-ever fully illustrated Ramcharitmanas. Artists came from Delhi, which, in its imperial twilight, had become home to coffee houses, provocative Urdu literature, and Mughal-obsessed British White sahibs. They came from Lucknow, where the Nawabs of Awadh presided over a court of music and dance and European fashions. They came from Kota and Jaipur in Rajasthan, dazzling with colourful textiles and avant-garde artists. Some were drawn by family and professional networks. Others, as Singh notes, may have been sent by nawabs and rajas in a show of diplomatic solidarity.The last bloom of North Indian art

The Kanchana Chitra Ramayana was to have nearly 1,100 pages, of which 548 were illustrated. Each illustration took months to finish. It needed the attention of master sketchers and outliners, apprentice painters, and expert illuminators to create its gilded borders and golden palaces. It needed a constant supply of precious materials to turn into paint and pigment. Its workers needed food, residences, and cash. Most importantly, it needed project managers to assign pages to specific workshops, to put artists in touch with religious teachers who could explain complex philosophical ideas, and to manage calligraphers and illuminators for each page.

The pages of the Kanchana Chitra Ramayana are startling to look at, because of the sheer variety of regional and individual styles on display. The delicate, exquisite empathy of the Mughal courtly artist; the heavy-lidded eyes of the Jaipuri; the architecture-focused composition of the Awadhi.

1qybl3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qybl3n/the_attention_span_crisis_nobodys_talking_about/,The Attention Span Crisis Nobody's Talking About (and the Science-Based Fix),"# Your brain isn't broken. But it's probably been hijacked.

I spent months researching this after realizing I couldn't finish a single chapter without checking my phone. Turns out, this isn't just a ""me"" problem. The average attention span has dropped from 12 seconds in 2000 to 8 seconds today. Goldfish officially beat us at 9 seconds. But here's what I found digging through neuroscience research, podcasts with cognitive scientists, and books from people who've actually studied this stuff, our brains are incredibly adaptable. We can rebuild what's been eroded.

The issue isn't willpower. It's that we're fighting billion dollar algorithms designed to fragment our focus. Social media platforms literally employ behavioral psychologists to make their apps more addictive. Your biology is being weaponized against you. But once you understand the mechanics, you can reverse the damage.

Start with dopamine detoxing, but make it actually sustainable. [Dr. Anna Lembke's](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/anna-lembke) book Dopamine Nation completely changed how I think about this. She's a psychiatrist and addiction expert at Stanford, and the book hit the NYT bestseller list for good reason. She explains how our brains are wired for a delicate pleasure/pain balance, but constant stimulation from phones, social media, and streaming has thrown everything off. We're essentially in a state of chronic dopamine overload. Her solution isn't some extreme monk mode BS. It's about creating ""dopamine fasting"" windows where you deliberately avoid high stimulation activities. I started with just 1 hour in the morning, no phone, no music, no podcasts. Just existing. Sounds unbearable at first, but your brain recalibrates faster than you'd think. Within two weeks I could actually sit with my thoughts without losing my mind.

**Train your brain like a muscle with deliberate focus sessions.** Cal Newport talks about this extensively in Deep Work, which is basically the bible for anyone trying to unfuck their attention span. Newport's a computer science professor at Georgetown who's written multiple bestsellers on productivity. The core concept is treating focused work as a skill you deliberately practice. Start absurdly small. Set a timer for 20 minutes and work on ONE thing. No email. No Slack. No ""just quickly checking"" anything. When your brain screams for distraction (and it will), notice the urge but don't act on it. Write it down if you need to. This is literally rewiring your neural pathways. The Pomodoro technique works here too, 25 minutes of focus, 5 minute break. But the key is genuine single tasking during those 25 minutes. Most people think they're focused when they're really just rapidly task switching.

**Rebuild your reading stamina through incremental exposure.** This one's personal because I used to inhale books as a kid, then suddenly couldn't get past page 10 without my mind wandering. Neuroscientist Maryanne Wolf (she literally wrote the book on reading and the brain called Reader, Come Home) explains that deep reading creates unique neural circuits. But these circuits atrophy when we only engage in skimming and scrolling. Her advice is counterintuitive, start with short form content you actually enjoy, but read it on paper. Physical books or printed articles. The lack of hyperlinks and notifications makes a massive difference. I started with 10 pages a day of anything, fiction, nonfiction, whatever held my interest. No pressure to retain or analyze. Just the act of sustained reading. After a month I was back to finishing books.

If sitting down with physical books feels like too much friction right now, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), a personalized learning app that turns books, research papers, and expert insights into custom audio podcasts. Built by former Google engineers and Columbia grads, it pulls from sources like the ones mentioned here (Dopamine Nation, Deep Work, neuroscience research) and tailors them to your exact goals, like ""rebuild my attention span as someone who can't focus for 5 minutes."" You control the depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives when something clicks. The voice options are genuinely addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic style that makes learning feel less like work. It creates a structured learning plan that evolves with you, and you can ask questions mid-episode or customize what you want to focus on next. Perfect for commutes or gym time when you want to grow but doom-scrolling feels easier.

The app Readwise can help here too, it resurfaces highlights from stuff you've read, which reinforces the neural pathways and makes reading feel more rewarding.

**Protect your sleep like your attention depends on it, because it does.** [Dr. Matthew Walker's](https://psychology.berkeley.edu/people/matthew-p-walker) Why We Sleep is legitimately one of the most important books I've read. He's a neuroscience professor at UC Berkeley and his research on sleep's impact on cognitive function is pretty alarming. Even one night of poor sleep significantly impairs your prefrontal cortex, which is exactly the part of your brain responsible for focus and impulse control. Basically, when you're sleep deprived, you have zero chance of maintaining attention. His recommendation is non negotiable 7-9 hours, consistent sleep schedule, cool dark room, no screens an hour before bed. I use the Insight Timer app for guided sleep meditations when my brain won't shut up. It's free and has thousands of options, way better than paying for Calm or Headspace.

**Reclaim your morning before the chaos starts.** This isn't some rise and grind hustle culture thing, it's about giving your brain a fighting chance. The first hour after waking up is when your prefrontal cortex is most capable of focused work. But most of us immediately drown it in emails, news, and social media. That's like running a marathon before breakfast and wondering why you're exhausted. Try this for one week, phone stays in another room overnight, airplane mode until you've done at least one meaningful task in the morning. For me that's writing or reading. Sometimes it's just sitting with coffee and planning my day. But it's MY time before the world makes demands. The difference in mental clarity is insane.

**Create friction for distractions, make focus the path of least resistance.** Delete social media apps from your phone. You can still access them via browser, but that extra step matters. Use website blockers like Freedom or Cold Turkey during work sessions. Put your phone in another room. Sounds dramatic but physical distance actually works. The goal isn't perfection, it's making distraction slightly harder than staying focused. Your brain will naturally follow the easiest path.

The uncomfortable truth is that rebuilding your attention span requires consistently choosing short term discomfort for long term gain. But neuroplasticity is real. Your brain will adapt. You just have to give it the conditions to do so.",2,1770464108.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770463994.0,CNfans,1,1.0,False

1qybjc6,https://i.redd.it/rwsg3l7d12ig1.png,Alan Wake novelization review,"Only took me 16 years to pick up and read this. Alan Wake novelization by Rick Burroughs (who may or may not be a pseudonym) was released in May of 2010, around the same time the game was released on Xbox.

The novel is around 300 pages long, and follows the story piece by piece in order of the events. All major characters are in it, all major plot points, and several pieces of dialogue are word for word.

There are some changes made, mostly for space saving reasons to my belief which I will list. The book also sometimes describes certain things relatively briefly, and it makes it a lot easier to read and follow along if you played the game - preferably several times - before reading the book.

It was very easy for me to visualize what Alan, Barry, Breaker and the others were doing as I was reading the book since I had seen this play out so many times, both in the original game and the 2021 remaster.

The book itself was very easy to read, and I finished the last 100 pages in a morning's sitting. It is well written for what it is, and much better to plow through than I had expected from a novel adapted from a video game.

I get the feeling that the author ran out of time, and there's a lot more nuance in the earlier half of the book than the latter.

It's not exactly Wake's manuscript, even if some of his pages - as well as pages from the Alan Wake Files - are included in between chapters. These pages are almost random and felt kind of off at times. They almost felt like padding out the book, or blatant fan service and was mostly no that necessary, especially since most of the pages that were necessary were directly quoted in text of the chapters.

They even included some of Pat Maine's radio segments which was nice!

Reading the book made me feel like watching a let's play (in my head) and there were no real problems I had with the novelization. It's not a master piece in the way that it presents deeper analysis of events, it stays very true to the story and plays it somewhat safe in that regard.

I've tried to read other game novels and they've been terrible, and that is most definitely a testament to that this novel does an exemplary job in conveying the story of the first Alan Wake game.

DIFFERENCES \*SPOILERS\*

>!\- In the beginning of the story Alan and Alice find a car in the woods seemingly dropped from the sky - very similar to the boat in the trailer park in the game.!<

>!\- Wake leaves his gun at Stucky's gas station and goes with Barry to retrieve it before going to the Elderwood National Park!<

>!\- Barry, not Sarah, takes Alan to Cauldron lake to see that the cabin is gone.!<

>!\- Alan has a lot of thoughts concerning what is going on, and how this new situation makes him feel. This is mostly present in the beginning. He thinks a lot more about the people he ""kill"" like Stucky, and very much so Rusty - even crying at the fact that he met the guy and knew of his affection to Rose. Alan is a lot more sensitive, at least in the beginning, than the in game Alan.!<

>!\- There's waaaay less fighting Taken in the book. The ""bosses"" if that's a word for it are encountered for, but most of the ""normal"" taken are very few and far in between that he actually fights.!<

>!\- A funny thing is that Alan tries to get Barry out of Rose trailer by putting him on a wheelbarrow (no joke) and he is about to get him to their car when Nightingale shows up and he has to go.!<

>!\- He had a plan to contact Sheriff Breaker after Rose's trailer to team up and surprise the kidnapper. Nightingale's apperance prevents this.!<

>!\- Alan has an image of Weaver appearing before him in the cell in Bright Falls.!<

>!\- Nightingale briefly mentions Finn (referenced a lot more in Alan Wake Files).!<

>!\- Barry, Wake and Wheeler all go to Weaver together at the dam and Breaker tells Weaver that Alan is a friend. This obviously mean that they all simply go through the water pipe together to the dam, and the in game segment is totally skipped.!<

>!\- Alan doesn't threaten Breaker with a gun (I liked this change a lot, she just ""understood"" which I think was a valid change)!<

>!\- Breaker meets and help Alice when she comes out of the lake, even gives her a blanket and coffee.!<

>!\- A neat thing is that Alan himself reflects on ""whether Thomas Zane was a handy creation of Alan Wake... or whether Wake was a creation of Thomas Zane""!<

>!\- Tons of parts are skipped, especially in Episode 6 where Alan simply gets in a car from the power station and drives to Cauldron Lake and jumps in after shooting a single flare into a tornado just kind of sitting there on the lake. Everything else - even the Majestic motel - has been cut. Tons of action heavy segments are simply gone.!<

>!Another obvious scene cut was Wake meeting Pat Maine at the radio station.!<

>!Night Springs TV show is mentioned, but we never actually get to see a proper description of an episode.!<

IS IT RECOMMENDED?

So do I recommend the book? Well of course! For all of us wishing there was a ""Departure the novel"", well this is it! It's still in print so it is easy to get a hold of and for us super fans (or Roses) it is a must have collector's item, and a must read.

I had a lot of fun reading this, just seeing every scene in my head, hearing Barry's and Alan's and the other's voices in my head. It's more condensed, but makes the story somewhat simpler to follow and reflect on.

It's not exactly a replacement of the video game since the video game is longer, and has more scenes to it, as well as descriptions like visuals. Like said, I do recommend playing the game first, and read the book after - usually I'd say it's the other way around, but I think a casual reader might be confused by the book if one hasn't played the game.

I will actually play Alan Wake 2 after this since I feel it was almost a complete playthrough in book form. I feel that the characters were true to themselves and I had a lot of fun reading it.",27,1770463940.0,AlanWake,1,1.0,False

1qybels,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qybels,Happy Yashoda Jayanti,"Wishing all an Auspicious Yashoda Jayanti    
  
In Kali Sadhana, Yashoda Jayanti is not a narrative remembrance; it is a **subtle revelation of the inner spiritual process of the jiva itself**. Yashoda is the spiritual mother   the form of the Mother who grooms, protects, disciplines, and nurtures. She is the maternal face of Maa Kali. Krsna represents the sadhaka , the jiva moving through the world under divine supervision, carrying within himself both playfulness and cosmic responsibility.

Yashoda is Maa Kali (636th name), and Krsna too is Kali herself (36th and 362nd names). This non-duality is fundamental. Kali is both the Mother and the Child, both the nurturer and the one being nurtured. Therefore, the sadhaka does not merely worship externally. **He lives the Yashoda–Krsna relationship internally**, moment by moment, through surrender and remembrance.

  
Krsna (sadhaka) is born through Devaki, the physical mother. Devaki births the sadhaka  into the body and the bloodline.  She gives the body, and without the body there can be no sadhana and for that Devaki is deeply respected .

Yet Krsna does not remain there. He is carried across darkness, danger, fear, and uncertainty to Gokula and finally to the lap of Yashoda.

This is the journey of the sadhaka in short from physcial mother to Spiritual mother. Both Being Kaali 

Born into obligation and survival, the sadhaka initially lives within prakruti and its maya. Over time, through experience and inner awakening, he sees the limitations of this world and chases MahaMaya and paraprakruti :).  
Recognizing that nourishment cannot come from matter alone, he **returns inward to the spiritual mother Yashoda**, who is Kali only  , where true grooming of consciousness begins.



Krishna was born with a purpose to destroy evil, to teach the Gita, to establish dharma. Similarly, the sadhaka is born in this loka for a **specific daiva karya** (divine work): to establish righteousness in their sphere, to offer the light of liberation to their bloodline, to teach and guide the ""Arjunas"" of their age. This duty is performed not through personal will, but under the direct supervision and will of Maa AdyaKali. The sadhaka turns inward, clinging to japa, discipline of sadhana, and complete surrender, resting in the lap of this spiritual awareness of Maa AdyaKali .

Yashoda, like all mothers, faces a familiar concern  
“Arre mera lallaa mitti kha raha hai , kyun khata hai mitti?”

From the world’s perspective, it is a small problem. From the mother’s perspective, it is an opportunity for revelation.

When Yashoda cleans Krsna’s mouth, she sees the Brahmanda.

Likewise, the sadhaka encounters countless small problems, confusion, mistakes, distractions, emotional turbulence. Yet when these moments are met with AWARENESS and surrender, **the universe itself reveals the kala gyana and the teaching which was meant to absorb from that particular small problem**. Maa Kali does not punish the sadhaka for “eating mud.” She cleanses, corrects, and nurtures.

In small problems, Kali is fully present teaching the sadhaka and helping him navigate this ocean of Maya. 

We see Yashoda always busy churning butter, managing the home, serving the family. Yet, the moment Krishna cried or called, she dropped everything and ran to him. This is the precise nature of Maa Kali in a sadhaka's life. Even as She expands the universe at 74 kilometers per second, even as She spins galaxies like grains of sand, she is eternally bound by love to respond to Her child's call.

Whenever the sadhaka ""eats mud"" (stumbles into confusion or despair) She comes to cleanse and nurture. Her response is instant for one who is sincerely devoted. The apparent chaos of the universe does not mean the mother is unavailable. She is simultaneously creating a coffee galaxy in one breath and wiping the mud from Her child's mouth in the next. 



When the sadhaka installs Maa Kaalika at the top priority in life , when sadhaka installs her in his heart and clings only to Her, life begins to arrange itself. The Yoginis of Maa Kali ,the  Shaktis that govern every atom and event, take care of everything else. There is no need for anxious ASKING or Managaing .  
  
 As Yashoda’s household ran by the grace of her love, the sadhaka’s life begins to flow (*sahaja*) in the natural current of the Divine Mother's will. Duties are fulfilled, protection is given, and wisdom dawns not by personal effort alone, but by the power of surrender to the One who is both the Chaser and the Child, the Binder and the Bound, Yashoda and Krishna: **Maa Kali, the Supreme Reality Herself.**

Thus, Yashoda Jayanti reminds the sadhaka: Your life is this divine lila. You are the child being raised in this mrityuloka , and you are the motherly awareness doing the raising. Both are Kali. Perform your daiva karya in the world, but never forget you are always under the watchful, loving, and liberating gaze of the Divine Mother.

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",2,1770463293.0,cnfans_reps,1,1.0,False

I’m working on a coffee startup called **SNIP**, and I wanted to get the community's thoughts before we pull the trigger on our first production run.

**The Problem:** Most coffee in India is either instant powder (full of sugar/fillers) or liquid decoctions that come in messy tear-away plastic sachets. Plus, that ""caffeine crash"" is real.

**The Solution:** We are launching liquid coffee concentrates in **Snap Packs** (one-handed, fold-and-squeeze tech). No mess, fits in your wallet, and takes 2 seconds to mix.

**The ""Healthy"" Edge:** We’re not just selling caffeine. Our first blend is infused with **EGCG** (for that calm, focused energy without the jitters) and a **Nootropic blend** to help with deep work and focus.

**Why I’m here:** I want to validate if this is something you’d actually use.

* Would you switch your morning brew for a nootropic-infused liquid snap?
* What’s one ""functional"" benefit you wish your coffee had? (Focus? Anxiety relief? Metabolism?)

In its [annual mineral commodities summary](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2026/mcs2026.pdf) published on Friday, the USGS found that the country was 100% import reliant last year for 16 out of the 90 non-fuel commodities that it tracked. In addition, the US relied more than one-half of its apparent consumption for 54 of the minerals, the report showed.

As highlighted in the report, the United States is totally reliant on its imports of arsenic (all forms), asbestos, cesium, fluorspar, gallium, graphite (natural), indium, manganese, mica (natural), niobium (columbium), rubidium, scandium, strontium, tantalum, titanium (sponge metal) and yttrium. Most of these are on the USGS critical minerals list, with asbestos, mica and strontium being the only absentees.

An additional 20 critical minerals had a net import reliance of greater than 50%, down from 28 in 2024, USGS noted.

# China’s chokehold

For many of the USGS critical minerals, China features prominently as a key supply source, accounting for nearly half of its arsenic and graphite imports, 55% of its antimony, and 70% of rare earths.

“This report underscores just how hard it is to put a dent in China’s decades-long strategy to dominate the world’s minerals markets,” said Rich Nolan, president and CEO of the National Mining Association (NMA), in a press release.

Another leading source of critical minerals is Canada, which supplies the aluminum, gallium, potash and zinc to the US. For copper and silver, which were recently added to the USGS list, Chile and Mexico were the leading import sources respectively.

The USGS report comes at a time when the US government is intensifying efforts to establish a critical minerals supply chain that is independent of China. Earlier this week, the Trump administration unveiled plans for a [$12 billion stockpile of critical minerals](https://www.mining.com/trump-plans-12b-minerals-vault-to-cut-china-reliance/). Vice President JD Vance followed that up by announcing plans to marshal allies into a preferential trade bloc for critical minerals.

“We have an administration and Congress that have united around the need to de-risk our supply chains and reshore minerals production and processing, but it still takes an average of 29 years to bring a mine online in the US,” Nolan said.

“That’s far too long. Quick action by the administration has been key in jumpstarting domestic mining efforts but we need Congress to act on permitting reform to create the kind of lasting certainty that mining companies need in order to make long-term investments in US projects.”

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

[Top-10 USGS critical minerals like Niobium, Dysprosium, and Terbium, plus Scandium, Titanium\/TiCl₄, and magnet REEs \(Nd\/Pr\).

**🔥 The USGS 2026 CONFIRMS IT: America’s Critical Minerals Problem Isn’t Mining — It’s CHINA… and Elk Creek is the U.S. Reset Button**

The **2026 USGS Mineral Commodity Summary** just dropped and it basically screams what we’ve all been saying for years: **the U.S. is still dangerously exposed to China across the critical mineral supply chain** — not just in mining, but in **processing, refining, magnet-grade separation, and downstream control.** The chokehold is real, it’s decades deep, and the report makes it crystal clear that the “cheap and fast” era is over. The U.S. now has one job: **secure domestic + allied supply chains or lose industrial sovereignty.**

Now here’s the part retail is missing while NioCorp trades at $6 like it’s a penny stock: **Elk Creek is literally positioned in the dead center of this entire national strategy.** Not one mineral. Not two. **Seven.** And not fringe ones either — we’re talking **Top-10 USGS critical minerals** like **Niobium, Dysprosium, and Terbium**, plus **Scandium, Titanium/TiCl₄, and magnet REEs (Nd/Pr).** That’s a full-spectrum industrial basket tied directly to **defense, aerospace, EVs, SMRs, drones, missiles, and AI-era manufacturing.**

**This is why the timing matters: Project Vault + FORGE + EXIM** weren’t launched for fun. They were launched because Washington finally realized the market cannot solve this alone. **Vault is the stockpile mechanism. FORGE is the allied pricing + trade-zone mechanism. EXIM is the financing weapon. And Elk Creek fits ALL of it:** **DFARS-compliant, domestic, secure, generational**, and designed for **vertical integration — mining → processing → metals → alloys → (future) recycling.** That’s exactly what Rubio and Vance were talking about when they said it’s not enough to mine — **you have to process.**

And this is where the “Saudi Arabia of Scandium” line stops being hype and starts being policy reality. Scandium is listed. Scandium is high priority. And Sc-Al alloy isn’t a science project anymore — it’s a **DoD + Prime-level requirement** if the U.S. is serious about next-gen airframes, range extension, weight reduction, and high-performance systems. **If scandium gets swept into price floors or stockpile logic like the 2025 Rio/DLA-style deal level, Elk Creek becomes bankable overnight. That’s not retail excitement — that’s literally how EXIM underwriting works.**

**Bottom line:** **The USGS 2026 report is a public admission that the U.S. is still stuck in the danger zone —** and the Trump admin response is the most aggressive supply chain repositioning since the Cold War. **Project Vault is the warehouse. FORGE is the alliance engine. EXIM is the funding cannon.** And Elk Creek is the kind of domestic “strategic basket” project that gets plugged into all three.

[NioCorp is Engaged & Rolling.. \\""The Elk Creek story is about to hit the catalyst stack like a freight train...All Aboard!!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1qyb8bo/video/yigxpbdj22ig1/player)

And here’s the part Wall Street is STILL sleeping on: **the Elk Creek story is about to hit the catalyst stack like a freight train** — **Scandium-Aluminum alloy reveal is imminent**, **March DFS is the hard-reset moment**, and once the numbers are stamped, **offtakes don’t “maybe” happen… they HAVE to happen** because Vault/FORGE/EXIM just turned critical minerals into a national security procurement lane, not a commodity gamble. Add in what Smith already confirmed — **NioCorp was in D.C., met with EXIM, and has mid-2026 FID telegraphed** — and you’re looking at the exact setup where a $6 stock can reprice violently when the market finally realizes this isn’t a junior miner anymore… it’s a U.S. industrial base buildout. **Because in Mark Smith’s words: “Elk Creek is a National Strategic Asset.” Period!**

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770462424.0,1to1reps,2,1.0,False

Off-White x Nike Air Jordan 1 Low
Heel arrow catches platform light just right. Lost the zip-tie lace lock by day five—minor hassle, but wearing the remaining one loose feels more me now.

Nike Air Jordan 1 Low ""Pine Green""
Velvet upper shrugged off a cold brew splash. Wiped clean with a napkin. Swapped to red laces for weekend hangs—quiet refresh.

Balenciaga Logo Spray Hoodie
Fabric softened nicely after washes. Hood depth saves bad hair days. Red stripe under logo? Barely visible unless someone’s close—intentional subtlety.

Off-White Industrial Zip Hoodie
Drawstrings faded slightly, looks naturally broken-in. Silver arrow on back caught store light during a late-night errand. Clerk nodded. Felt good.

AMIRI Distressed Hoodie
Held up through a packed show. Checked the tears afterward—stitching intact. Distressing feels earned, not fragile.

Chrome Hearts Cross Hoodie
Heavyweight cotton = zero chill waiting for the train. Embroidered crosses have subtle texture. Ran my thumb over them while waiting—oddly grounding.

Balenciaga Flame Print Jeans
Wide leg hides lazy days. Print softened noticeably after two washes (I prefer the muted look now, but heads up if you want bold graphics). Do not bike in these—fabric doesn’t give where it counts.

Hellstar Track Pants
""30"" on the side glows faintly in dark hallways. Found my keys faster last night. For the price? Thoughtful detail that lands.

1qyb0bv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidMen/comments/1qyb0bv/the_psychology_of_attraction_why_being_present/,The Psychology of Attraction: Why Being Present Makes You 10x More Desirable,"

You know what's wild? We've been fed this idea that attraction is about looks, money, or being some alpha chad. But after going down a rabbit hole of psychology research, behavioral studies, and honestly way too many podcasts, I realized most of us are sabotaging ourselves with one thing: we never learned how to be genuinely present with people.

I'm talking about real presence. Not the fake nodding while mentally rehearsing what you'll say next. Not the constant phone checking. Not the anxious energy of trying to impress. Just being fully there, like the person in front of you is the only thing that matters in that moment. Sounds simple but it's insanely rare.

Here's the thing, our brains aren't wired for this anymore. Between notifications, dopamine loops from social media, and the constant mental chatter about our own insecurities, we're never actually here. And people can feel that. They might not consciously know it, but they sense when you're distracted, when you're performing, when you're somewhere else mentally. That registers as low interest or worse, low value.

Active listening is the cheat code nobody talks about. [Dr. John Gottman](https://youtube.com/@thegottmaninstitute?si=gRo-FbEM-JI8lhck), the relationship researcher who can predict divorce with scary accuracy, found that the quality of attention we give people is one of the strongest predictors of relationship success. But it goes way beyond romantic stuff. When you actually listen, people feel seen. And feeling seen is basically emotional crack for humans.

This means eye contact without staring them down like a psychopath. It means noticing their energy shifts. When they light up talking about something, lean into that. When they seem hesitant, give them space. It's not about interrogating or fake enthusiasm. It's about curiosity without agenda. People remember how you made them feel way more than anything clever you said.

The body language thing is underrated too. Amy Cuddy's work at Harvard on power poses gets memed a lot, but the underlying science is solid. Your posture literally changes your brain chemistry. Stand like you matter and your cortisol drops while testosterone increases. You feel more confident, which makes others perceive you as more confident. But here's what she doesn't emphasize enough: open body language toward others matters just as much. Uncross your arms. Face them fully. Mirror their energy without being weird about it. These tiny adjustments signal safety and openness, which is what attraction actually builds on.

Most people think confidence is loud. It's not. Real confidence is quiet and grounded. It's being okay with silence. It's not filling every gap with nervous chatter or trying to prove anything. Matthew Hussey talks about this in his relationship content, how desperate energy repels people faster than anything. The moment you stop needing validation from every interaction, you become magnetic. Because suddenly you're not taking, you're just existing comfortably in your own skin. That's rare as hell.

If you want to dive deeper into these psychology patterns but don't have energy for dense research papers, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is worth checking out. It's an AI learning app that pulls from relationship psychology books, dating research, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. You can tell it something specific like ""I'm an introvert who wants to be more magnetic in social situations"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan around that, with episodes ranging from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives packed with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's even a smooth, conversational style that makes complex psychology feel like a friend explaining things over coffee.

There's a neuroscience angle that blew my mind. Our brains have mirror neurons that literally mimic the emotional states of people around us. When you're calm and present, people unconsciously match that. When you're anxious and scattered, same thing. So your internal state isn't just about you, it's contagious. [Andrew Huberman's](https://youtube.com/@hubermanlab?si=ryYlGPaf_P7u723k) podcast has episodes on this, how managing your nervous system through breathing or just slowing down physically can shift entire social dynamics. If you walk into situations slightly calmer than everyone else, you automatically become a stabilizing presence people gravitate toward.

Social media destroyed our attention spans but it also gave us this weird performance anxiety where we're always auditioning. Every conversation becomes a chance to seem interesting rather than actually connecting. But genuine curiosity beats interesting every time. Ask questions you actually want answers to. Not interview questions, but the kind that spark real conversation. ""What's been keeping you busy lately?"" is boring. ""What's the best part of your week so far?"" opens actual dialogue.

Validation without neediness is the sweet spot. Compliment specifics, not generics. ""You have great style"" is whatever. ""That jacket color is perfect on you"" shows you actually looked. But don't make it transactional, like you're depositing coins hoping for something back. People can smell that from miles away. Give compliments because you noticed something, then move on. No lingering for a response. That's confident.

The vulnerability piece matters too but not how people think. You don't trauma dump or overshare. You just don't pretend to be perfect. Brené Brown researches this stuff at University of Houston and her finding is pretty clear: people connect over imperfection, not polish. When you admit you don't know something or you made a mistake, you become human. Relatable. Safe to be around. Most people are so terrified of seeming flawed they never let anyone in.

Here's what changed things for me. I started treating every person like they had something interesting to teach me. Barista, Uber driver, whoever. Not in a condescending way but genuine interest. You'd be shocked what people open up about when they feel seen. And practicing this with strangers made it second nature with people I actually wanted to connect with. It's like reps at the gym but for social skills.

You don't need to become someone else. You just need to get out of your own head long enough to actually show up. Stop the mental highlight reel of your own performance. Stop scanning the room for something better. Stop filtering everything through ""what do they think of me?"" Just be there, interested, calm, real.

That's the whole trick. Presence. It costs nothing, requires no special skills, and makes you instantly more magnetic than 90% of people who are too busy performing to actually connect. Wild how something so simple is so rare.",1,1770462092.0,SolidMen,0,1.0,False

1qyax6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenInModernDating/comments/1qyax6t/who_actually_pays_on_the_first_date_the/,Who Actually Pays on the First Date? The Psychology Behind the Check (and Why It Matters More Than You Think),"Studied dating dynamics for years and noticed something wild: we're all still weirdly anxious about splitting the check in 2025. I've watched friends spiral over Venmo requests, seen Reddit threads with 500+ comments debating who should pay, and honestly? We've overcomplicated something that reveals SO much about compatibility if you just know what to look for.

Here's what I learned after diving into relationship psychology research, Matthew Hussey's work, and way too many dating podcasts. This isn't about who has more money or performative chivalry. It's about emotional generosity, reciprocity patterns, and how early interactions predict long term relationship health.

# 1. The payment moment is actually a generosity test, not a gender role thing

Matthew Hussey (relationship coach who's advised millions and written multiple bestsellers) breaks this down perfectly: whoever asks should OFFER to pay. Not because of outdated gender scripts, but because invitation implies hosting energy. When you invite someone to dinner, you're creating an experience. That's hosting. Hosts cover costs.

BUT, and this is crucial, the other person's response matters more than the actual payment. Do they offer to split? Do they say thank you with genuine warmth? Do they suggest ""I'll get the next one"" (indicating they want a next time)? These micro moments reveal their generosity baseline.

Research from social psychology shows reciprocity patterns established early predict relationship satisfaction years later. If someone never offers, never acknowledges the gesture, never reciprocates in ANY way? That's data. Use it.

**Book rec**: [*Get The Guy*](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Get_the_Guy.html?id=wQAFm57ecF0C&redir_esc=y) by Matthew Hussey. Insanely good read that completely changed how I think about dating dynamics. Hussey's not some pickup artist, he's got a degree in psychology and has coached people for 15+ years. The book won multiple awards and became an international bestseller for good reason. He breaks down the psychology behind attraction without the manipulative BS you see everywhere else. The chapter on ""value"" and generosity literally made me rethink every failed relationship I've had. This is the best modern dating psychology book I've read, period.

# 2. Traditional expectations exist in a vacuum, your actual dynamic doesn't

Yeah, some people still expect men to pay always. Some women feel uncomfortable if they don't split. Some people want to alternate. All valid. The problem isn't WHAT you prefer, it's forcing your preference onto someone without discussing it.

Dating expert [Logan Ury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Ury) (director of relationship science at Hinge, has a behavioral science background from Harvard) emphasizes this in her work: unspoken expectations kill relationships before they start. You're not a mind reader. Neither are they.

If you're the person who asked and paid for date one, see what they do on date two. Do they plan something and cover it? Do they suggest splitting going forward? Do they ghost? Their behavior tells you if they value mutual investment.

Honestly the worst case scenario isn't someone who wants to split, it's someone who takes repeatedly without acknowledging it. That pattern doesn't stay confined to restaurant bills, it bleeds into emotional labor, household tasks, everything.

# 3. Your discomfort with receiving reveals as much as their discomfort with giving

Here's something nobody talks about: if someone offers to pay and you feel SUPER uncomfortable accepting, that might be your shit to work on, not theirs. A lot of us (especially women conditioned to never ""owe"" anyone) struggle to receive generosity gracefully.

Brené Brown's research on vulnerability shows that difficulty receiving is often tied to worthiness issues. We don't feel deserving of generosity, so we reject it defensively. But healthy relationships require both giving AND receiving. If you can't accept a dinner without spiraling about ""owing"" someone, you'll struggle with emotional intimacy too.

Obviously trust your gut if something feels manipulative. But if someone's genuinely being kind and you're panicking? That's worth examining.

**App rec**: Paired is lowkey one of the best relationship apps I've found. It's designed for couples but honestly the psychology content applies to dating too. Daily questions about communication patterns, attachment styles, conflict resolution. Takes like 5 minutes a day but completely shifts how you think about relationship dynamics.

For a more structured approach to understanding your dating patterns, there's also [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), a personalized learning app that pulls from relationship psychology books, research papers, and expert insights to create custom audio content based on what you're struggling with. You can literally type in something like ""why do I attract emotionally unavailable people"" or ""how to build healthy reciprocity as someone with anxious attachment,"" and it generates a learning plan just for you. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 15-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. It's built by folks from Columbia and Google, so the content quality is solid. Worth checking out if you want to go deeper on any of this relationship psychology stuff without reading ten books.

# 4. The ""I'll get next time"" line is a compatibility filter disguised as politeness

When someone says ""thanks for dinner, I'll get the next one"" they're doing three things: acknowledging your generosity, indicating they want to see you again, and establishing reciprocity. That's basically the holy trinity of healthy relationship behavior in one sentence.

If you paid for date one and they say nothing, don't offer to split or reciprocate, and then expect you to pay again? You're not in the early stages of a relationship, you're auditioning for the role of ATM with occasional sex.

Psychologist Eli Finkel (relationships researcher at Northwestern, wrote [*The All Or Nothing Marriage*](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/The_All_or_nothing_Marriage.html?id=AtkxDwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y)) found that modern relationships require much more intentional investment than previous generations. We expect partners to be everything: best friend, therapist, adventure buddy, financial partner. If someone won't invest $40 into getting to know you, they're definitely not gonna invest the emotional energy required for modern partnership.

# 5. Generosity is a pattern, not a transaction

This whole debate gets weird because we're obsessed with the FIRST date. But honestly? One date proves nothing. What matters is the pattern over time.

Does generosity flow both directions eventually? Do they plan dates and experiences? Do they bring you coffee unprompted? Do they offer their time, attention, and emotional energy freely? THAT'S what matters.

I know people who always split checks perfectly but are wildly generous in other ways. I also know people who perform generosity financially but are emotionally stingy as hell. The medium matters less than the pattern.

**Podcast rec**: *The Psychology of Your 20s* by Jemma Sbeg. Australian host with psychology background who breaks down relationship dynamics, attachment theory, modern dating patterns in such a digestible way. The episode on ""generosity imbalances"" genuinely helped me identify patterns I'd been ignoring. Episodes are like 30-40 minutes, perfect for commutes.

# 6. If you're genuinely struggling financially, communicate that instead of keeping score

Real talk: if you're broke and dating, that's tough but manageable if you're upfront. Suggesting free/cheap dates (hiking, museum free days, cooking together) shows investment without financial strain.

What kills things is when someone's silently keeping score. ""I paid for three dinners and they only paid for one"" okay but did they cook for you twice? Did they drive an hour to see you? Did they plan a whole day trip?

Different people show generosity differently based on their resources. Economic compatibility matters longterm, but early on, flexibility and creativity matter more than dollar amounts.

The key question: does this person WANT to contribute equally, even if their contribution looks different? Or are they just taking?

# Look, here's the thing

The payment debate persists because we're all trying to decode ""does this person value me?"" from a single transaction. But generosity, reciprocity, and investment are patterns you assess over multiple interactions.

Offer to pay if you invited. Graciously accept OR offer to split based on your values. Observe their response without judgment. See what they do on date two and three. Notice if generosity flows both ways over time.

And please, PLEASE stop dating people who repeatedly take without acknowledging or reciprocating. That's not about gender roles or modern dating confusion. That's just someone showing you exactly who they are.

Your time and energy are worth someone who matches your investment. The check is just the preview.",1,1770461789.0,MenInModernDating,0,1.0,False

It made me realize I haven’t been clear enough: SitesBuddy is not a ""Widget Subscription."" It’s a Code Generator.

Most big corporate platforms ""rent"" you code for a monthly fee. If you stop paying, your client’s site breaks. I think that’s a terrible way to do business.

We built SitesBuddy with a different philosophy:

**YOUR PRIVACY & SECURITY MATTERS**  
We built SitesBuddy with privacy at the core, not as an afterthought. SitesBuddy generates clean HTML/CSS/JS code that you add directly to your site. No tracking. No dependencies. No hidden scripts.

**🔒 NO DATA COLLECTION**  
SitesBuddy widgets do **not** collect, track, transmit, or store any visitor data. What happens on your site stays on your site.

**🚀 NO USAGE LIMITS - NO HIDDEN FEES**  
Big corporate platforms charge based on views or traffic. Basically they rent-you-the-code for monthly fee. SitesBuddy does not. You can use our widgets on 1 site or 1,000 sites. No surprise bills if your site or your client’s site goes viral.

**🌐 NO DEPENDENCY RISK**  
Everything you create is embedded directly into your site.  
No external hosting. No third-party scripts that can break. No external servers required to keep your widgets running.

Once a widget is added to your site, it is yours. Even if you uninstall the SitesBuddy or stop using extension, your existing widgets continue working forever.

SitesBuddy generates clean, human-readable code. Want to add a custom animation or an AI-generated twist? Just copy the code and tweak it. No 'black box' scripts, no restrictions.""

*Unlike most widget platforms, you truly own what you build.*

**BTW: Test it yourself**

If you want to test our widgets, just click **“Go Pro”** inside the extension. We offer a **free 3-day trial**.

* Even if you cancel within those 3 days, any widgets you created and added to your site will **continue working forever**.
* Yes, you could technically subscribe, grab every widget you need, and cancel immediately.

We are that confident you will stay because we keep shipping new widgets and features you will actually want to use for your next project.

Many of our users stay and support us because, although we originally designed this for Google Sites, people also use our tools on WordPress, Squarespace, Wix, and Shopify. It costs about as much as **one coffee a month**, but it saves you hours and even days of manual work.

1qyavxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1qyavxn/slowly_being_my_parents_retirement_plan/,Slowly being my parents’ retirement plan,"I’m so drained sa laging pagpaparinig ng parents ko, to the point na nagkasagutan na kami. I didn’t expect this to happen. I’m an only child, and we came from a middle-class family. Hindi ako spoiled, pero lahat talaga ng needs ko nabigay sakin. Though yung wants hindi masyado especially travel or other material things, since mas priority ng parents ko yung papasukan kong school, at I’m thankful for that kasi kahit hindi naman kami mayaman, they were able to send me to private schools since kinder.

But now that I’m already working (fyi, new hire lang ako, hindi pa regular since I just graduated last year), everything changed. I’m working in a corpo at mkt, and I’ll admit, hindi pa malaki ang salary ko kasi kaka-start pa lang ng career ko, and mahal ang living expenses since nagre-rent pa ako.

Every time na uuwi ako sa amin, grabe yung pagpaparinig nila. Sila pa may sabi dati na kaya nila ko pinag-aral sa magagandang school ay para sa sarili ko, since only child nga ako, but I think, para sa kanila rin. Sabi rin nila nung nag-aapply pa lang ako, wag daw sila alalahanin kasi okay lang kahit hindi pa mataas ang sahod (yes, alam nila kung magkano) ko kasi “sarili ko lang naman ang iintindihin ko.” Hindi rin nila ako inoobliga magbigay ng pangbayad sa expenses nung una, since alam nila mababa pa sahod ko, and tbh, yung natitira after expenses ko is pang gastos ko lang for the whole month in mkt. Wala din naman akong ibang binibili, I don’t even go to coffee shops.

I am grateful for them, yes, I truly am. Pero nakaka-drain din pala kasi ngayon, todo parinig nanay ko, “Ako nung dalaga ganito ganyan, bigay ko lahat sa pamilya ko,” “Gusto ko ng ganito, ganyan,” tapos pag mainit ulo, sasabihan ako ng “Wala ka na ngang binibigay,” “Yung anak ni ano, siya nagbabayad ng kuryente nila,” “Buti pa si ano, pinamili nanay niya ng ganito.”

I am so drained. Ano bang ibibigay ko kung sakto pa lang para sa sarili ko yung sahod ko? Sinabi ko naman, wait lang ng ilang years, pero ngayon, parang nakikita ko na in the future, sa akin talaga sila sasandal financially. I mean, gets ko naman sila, they’re my parents, pero I just feel na parang hindi ako makakaipon para sa sarili ko kasi ako yung magiging retirement plan nila. My father is the only one working, and I think iniintay lang din nila na maging stable ang career ko financially, but soon, titigil na rin siya.

I get that okay lang sakin magbigay ng pambayad nila sa monthly expenses, kuryente, internet, groceries, but sabi ko wait lang ng mga ilang years kasi ang liit pa ng sahod ko at kulang pa sakin. At the same time, napapaisip na rin ako for the future, kasi wala rin naman sila ipapamana maliban sa bahay namin ngayon. We don’t have business, lot, or savings.

Ang ayoko lang kasi, hindi nila ako inoobliga magbigay, pero grabe naman sila magparinig. They are always included in my plans, at sabi ko nga sa future, talagang nasa wish list ko maipag-travel sila, pero mas gusto ko kasi yung ako ang magbibigay kasi hindi nila hinihingi, hindi yung namemressure. I know baka sabihin ng iba na wala akong utang na loob kasi magulang ko pa rin iyon, but valid naman, diba, yung nararamdaman ko? I just want to vent out.

I love them, I truly do, pero I think my relationship with my parents now is getting unhealthy compared to when I was still a student. Akala ko hindi ako mapapabilang sa mga ganitong nababasa tungkol sa ginagawang retirement plan ng magulang sa anak, pero I think I am now slowly being part of them.",16,1770461657.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770461630.0,pandabuyfinds,1,1.0,False

Off-White x Nike Air Jordan 1 Low
Heel arrow catches platform light just right. Lost the zip-tie lace lock by day five—minor hassle, but wearing the remaining one loose feels more me now.

Nike Air Jordan 1 Low ""Pine Green""
Velvet upper shrugged off a cold brew splash. Wiped clean with a napkin. Swapped to red laces for weekend hangs—quiet refresh.

Balenciaga Logo Spray Hoodie
Fabric softened nicely after washes. Hood depth saves bad hair days. Red stripe under logo? Barely visible unless someone’s close—intentional subtlety.

Off-White Industrial Zip Hoodie
Drawstrings faded slightly, looks naturally broken-in. Silver arrow on back caught store light during a late-night errand. Clerk nodded. Felt good.

AMIRI Distressed Hoodie
Held up through a packed show. Checked the tears afterward—stitching intact. Distressing feels earned, not fragile.

Chrome Hearts Cross Hoodie
Heavyweight cotton = zero chill waiting for the train. Embroidered crosses have subtle texture. Ran my thumb over them while waiting—oddly grounding.

Balenciaga Flame Print Jeans
Wide leg hides lazy days. Print softened noticeably after two washes (I prefer the muted look now, but heads up if you want bold graphics). Do not bike in these—fabric doesn’t give where it counts.

Hellstar Track Pants
""30"" on the side glows faintly in dark hallways. Found my keys faster last night. For the price? Thoughtful detail that lands.

In January 2023, I lost my baby through miscarriage. I was utterly devastated and turned to my then best friend for support. At first, she seemed genuinely kind, she invited us round for coffee, a cry, and a bit of comfort. It felt like she really wanted to be there for us.

A few days later, she invited us over again. They were revamping their back garden, and we offered to help, the hands-on distraction felt like it might actually do us some good. Around this time, I’d also been back in hospital myself due to complications from the miscarriage.

When we saw her, she asked how we were. I told her we’d been struggling but doing our best. Her response, roughly, was:

*“Well, I’ve been in hospital too. Remember I told you I was having pains? I’ve got an ectopic pregnancy… but don’t tell anyone. It must be from the cool-down period of (husband’s) vasectomy.”*

My immediate reaction was concern. Ectopic pregnancies are serious and can be life-threatening. A colleague of mine was going through one at the time and was having an awful experience. It’s not something to be taken lightly.

But something didn’t sit right.

Her husband’s vasectomy had been two years earlier. I knew that for a fact because she’d announced it to us all at a New Year’s Eve party in 2020, not exactly subtle. They already had two beautiful children and had made a clear decision together not to have any more.

The unease grew.  
Could an ectopic pregnancy go unnoticed for two years and suddenly cause symptoms? No.  
Could one be detected years later? Extremely unlikely, unless there were fertility investigations, and there weren’t.

For context, we’d been friends for seven or eight years by then. We’d met through our husbands, who worked together. We clicked immediately, similar interests, music taste, humour. She was confident and outspoken and I’ve always been quieter and more reserved. We became close enough to see each other without the husbands.

Looking back, there were warning signs I ignored. They made friends easily through her husband’s workplace (he isn’t from this country, so most of his friendships came from work), but there was a pattern, intense closeness, followed by fallouts. I’d heard stories of petty arguments, one-upping, and exaggeration. If someone went bowling, she’d gone bowling and achieved the highest score the alley had ever seen. Eventually, people drifted away.

My husband and another friend were among her husband’s longest-standing friends. I didn’t want to rock the boat. I didn’t know what would happen if I said something, but the worst-case scenario was damaging a marriage, a family, or long friendships. So I stayed quiet and slowly distanced myself.

I didn’t even tell my husband straight away. When he eventually asked why I was avoiding her, I explained the timing and the science. He agreed it didn’t add up, but again, without certainty, I couldn’t accuse someone of something so serious.

A few months later, my husband casually asked her how things were regarding the ectopic pregnancy. She brushed it off and said:

*“Oh, that was two years ago.”*

If that were true and it was two years ago, why would you bring it up to your supposed best friend two weeks after she’d just lost her baby less  than two weeks ago,  knowing how badly we’d been trying, and knowing you didn’t want more children?

She never once asked why I’d become distant, or reach out to us. Eventually, she blocked me on all social media. That alone told me a lot.

Fast-forward three years. She and her husband have since split. My husband, finally feeling able to ask, spoke to him directly about the ectopic pregnancy. His answer was clear: it never happened. They’ve never experienced any pregnancy loss at all.

Now comes the most toxic part.

She’s publicly portraying herself as the victim, claiming her ex-husband is a narcissist who was verbally abusive to her and the children. And while I know you can’t always see what goes on behind closed doors, after nearly ten years of knowing someone, you usually see the mask slip.

With her, we did.

Recently, she passed my husband in town. He didn’t engage and just turned away. That very night, she sent a long, emotional message to another mutual friend about how abusive her ex had been, how hard she’s had it, and how much she loves and respects this friend.

That friend, in the kindest way, is a soft touch, endlessly giving, endlessly empathetic. And she knows that.

If her claims were genuine, I believe she would have reached out to my husband after seeing him, wanting to explain, to set the record straight. But she didn’t. Because she knows she can’t manipulate us.

What hurts most is that she’s made this entire situation harder for the ex-husband and the children, and she’s getting away with it. It makes me wish I’d spoken up sooner, because people should know the kind of things she’s capable of lying about.

How do you lie about losing a baby to your supposed best friend who has just lost a baby?

The way I see it, she disrespected my baby. She tried to one-up my trauma. And now she gets to rewrite history while I carry the pain, because if I say anything now, she’ll deny it, twist it, or claim I’m being manipulated because I’m “on his side”.

And maybe worst of all, I think she’d enjoy knowing how much this has hurt me all these years.

I know I need to let it go.  
That’s why I’ve written it down.  
That’s why I’m putting it out into the universe.

KZ AJ4

Leather softened nicely by day three. Midsole’s firm though; hit 12k steps downtown and felt it by evening. Infrared panel catches low light beautifully. A stranger asked if they were the ’19 retro. Not bad for a daily driver.

Nike Crew Socks

Disappointing. Pilling started after two washes near the heel. Elastic lost tension fast—slid down to my arch halfway through a grocery run. Cheap price is the only argument. Honestly, skip these. Spend slightly more elsewhere.

RL Quarter-Zip Hoodie

Fleece lining = instant comfort on chilly mornings. Cuffs run tight (annoying when checking phone). Minor loose threads at the hem. Solid for quick errands where you want to look put-together without trying.

Burberry Knight Logo Hoodie

Silhouette is clean—relaxed but not sloppy. Got a ""nice vintage Burberry"" comment at brunch. Up close? ""PRORSUM"" lettering under the knight sits slightly wider than OG spec. Won’t bother casual wearers, but detail-oriented folks will notice. Still pulls the vibe.

CDG Heart Hoodie

Embroidery survived three cold washes untouched. Heavy cotton holds shape well. Sizing note: I’m 5’10”, 160 lbs—sized down to S for a clean fit. Pairs effortlessly with dark denim or track pants. Low-key head-turner.

Stussy x Nike Track Pants

Side tag stitching is precise. Zipper pull feels cheap and catches occasionally. Hidden drawcord at waistband = lifesaver after a big meal. Tapered ankle hits right. Versatile for casual days.

LV Monogram Pants

Arrived with a faint smudge near the knee and a strong chemical odor. Washed twice—odor lingers. Pattern alignment is decent, but the experience feels rushed. Not worth the mental friction. Link intentionally omitted.

VT SB Dunk Low

Suede repels light spills (coffee wiped clean with a damp cloth). Cushioning held up during a full IKEA trip—zero foot fatigue. Only flaw: laces are too smooth, constantly needing re-tying. Still, top-tier wear for the price.

RL Cable Knit Sweater

Texture reads premium layered over a button-down. 100% cotton wrinkles fast—sleeves looked tired after a few hours at the desk. Best for short outings where presentation matters. Great value under $ 50.

VT Dunks and CDG hoodie earned permanent spots in rotation. Burberry piece delivers aesthetic despite minor detailing gaps. Socks and LV pants? Tuition paid. Buy for your life, not the hype.",1,1770460924.0,RepFreight,1,1.0,False

It’s embarrassing to be so inexperienced for my age. On every date, my stomach flips like a coin as I rizz-lessly sputter nervous teenager C.W. dialogue. Maggie is kind about it. She solemnly suppresses her sly smirks and snorts with a *church-pew-whisper* hand. I’m grateful.

She’s a tireless flaneur, and now, so am I. She has spiked my insipid routine with novelty-seeking urban wanderlust. I’ve had more *firsts* in the 3 weeks since we met, than the monotonous 20 years previous. 

A street mural I pass everyday, Maggie stops to appreciate. An odd old musty store makes her light up like Christmas. When I assume it’s full of worn dusty junk. Maggie finds tranquil comfort in the hum of streetlamps, the undisturbed water in a pothole, smells of recent rain. Maggie’s fastidious curiosity has infected me, I am hopelessly sick with it, and the night has never felt so kinetic.

The problem is, I worry this novelty has breached something in my simplistic stick-in-mud sanity. I am fractured against myself. My own neurology disagrees with me that these feelings are too strong, too fast. Double-take impossibilities slink beyond my peripheral vision, and they are too numerous to ignore. I hear the twisted marching murmur of her skeleton when my back is turned, or the lights go out. Daily, I dismiss the voice that insists, Maggie is covertly a mass writing legion of centipedes, crickets, beetles, roaches, wasps, ants, moths, pupa, aphids and larva, stuffed into a woman shaped skin suit… 

A very pretty skin suit that insists I watch *The Rehearsal* on HBO.

Either, I have discovered my burgeoning schizophrenia, or…

Can anyone tell me if this kind of thing is normal for girls?

Maybe? Possibly? Hopefully? 



She just text me a picture of a rotten grapefruit…



My world was built from warm clay bricks of stoic masculine solitude. My brothers and I never fought the way movie siblings do. We primarily operated through telepathic looks and gestures like a military unit. My father was a 10 foot tall stack of cinder-block. immovable, imposing, and not particularly fun to talk to or hug. However he was not without his own brand of heedful warmth. If my problem was genuine, the answer would appear in his hands as if by magic. He communicated in caveman-ish dismissive grunts but he never once let me down.

We were 4 Lenneys (no Georges), in a blue double wide that drifted on an ocean of whispering alfalfa. Serenaded nightly by Nebraska wind, cicada song and low volume John Wayne movies. The cramped house was a shrine to a woman I never met, but loved as desperately as any of its inhabitants. My father attached every photo to the living room wall. Even blurry smile snapshots and fleeting foolish moments were arranged into the carefully calculated collage. So that I would know her, and so they would not forget. The last gift my mother surrendered, was the acknowledgement of her death anniversary, because no one ever called it anything other than *my birthday.*

I only had daily interaction with one woman. Our education was supervised by the Larson's. 1 mile down the dirt road. Clint taught us about horses, because the school of Clint Larson asserted everything under the sun was basically horses. 

“Son, Life is like a horse…”, 

“Y’now. Love is like a horse…”, 

“When you think bou’it, the sun is kinda like a horse…”.

Elanor Larson taught us English and mathematics. When she was mad, she spoke German and wielded a minacious wooden spoon. When she was anything else, it was only soft. Elanor was a living, breathing Norman Rockwell painting of builders' generation, window-sill pie, Americana.

But she was also kind of like a horse.

My middle brother might one day inherit Larson's stable. My oldest brother fled for Denver to study law. When I was old enough, I followed the eldest, so that I could live with him and study aimlessness.

The big city (or big to me) buzzed with vibrating electric clamor. Every sensation is exciting and abrasive. My senses were calibrated for hayloft napping, and now they were bombarded by car horns, vibrant neon, screaming wayward winos, and thrumming nightclub walls. My brother and I live in a foggy miasma smell of yeast and sugar, that wafts into our apartment from the bakery below. All of it was so very unlike a horse.

I met Margot (Maggie) Colany in a chalky bookstore. My weekly pilgrimage to meet the grumpy owner and the two sleepy cats that guard his secondhand merchandise. The clumsy orange tabby batted at sleek black Persian as the bell clang announced her entrance. 

Whenever I looked up, her eyes darted down into a botanist primer. She wore a feathery dress the lively green of ficus leaves. Her hair was the glossy black of the darkling beetle carapace. It draped at her collarbone, burying resin butterfly earrings like a forest timberline. When I approached, her eyes softened behind thick tortoise shell glasses, and she pushed a dimpled cheek against one sun speckled shoulder. 

Luckily, the gesture shut my brain down like a power outage, saving me from any insecurity that would have argued to pass her by. I floated back to my body as she finished typing her number into my phone. Locomotive steam came off my head as I stomped home like an idiot. The book I’d gone for, completely forgotten.

To my brother's annoyance, I spent the next two days pacing the apartment. Second guessing what to say, when to say it, and why to when it say that which what why it was when said. My brother was offensively surprised I got a date. Even more so when on that date, I got another. Each felt like looking forward to being struck by lightning.

On the first one we walked down 16th street mall. She said she wanted to show me something. My first date became 20 miniature adventures stacked together. We investigated quirky tourist shops. I played the painted piano they leave out on the street. I bought her a hand-helicopter that immediately spun into the sky and out of existence. We stopped for coffee, ice cream and a guy doing street magic. She scared my half to death when she grabbed a jamba juice door and her arm bent backwards. Exclaiming that it was broken as it flopped lazily from her elbow. When I picked up her hand she did the same to the other arm. Then explained she was double jointed. That didn’t save me from another 10 seconds of horrified panic while her arms flopped and she laughed at my confusion.

We walked until we found the Mcguffin of our expedition. She hopped up and down like a kid and pointed at the tower sized structure. A white oblong vertical statue that designated 16th street's end. Like an airplane with no wings stuck into the ground by the nose. She explained that she had no idea what it was actually called, but that it was colloquially referred to as “God’s Joint.” When I got home, I found my legs hurt from walking and my face hurt from smiling. 

My brother only looked up at the ceiling, a gesture that I knew ment “Shut the fuck up.” Even though I hadn’t said anything.

The second date was the first time I tried Thai food. Also the first time I learned about the existence of Thailand. Geography was not at all like a horse, and therefore had not been covered by the Larson's. My understanding of the world is currently regulated to the movies I’ve seen. If you told me “Middle earth is actually in the Balkans."" I would have to agree with you. I did not make that known at the time. She already laughed at me hard enough. She held her sides when the first bite made me start panting like a tropical beach trapped huskie. 

I suppressed a growing undercurrent of anxiety. I imagined saying the wrong thing and being exposed as a hick. Then stuffed in a box next to Larry the Cable guy, never to be reexamined again. To my relief, she was delighted to entertain, and I luxuriated in the role of audience.

I was fascinated by her extensive knowledge of saps and syrups, plants and nectar. Moon cycles, Jungian analysis, weaving wary dream silk. I learned that the full moon in March is called *the Worm Moon*. This year, April Fools Day will have a full *Pink Moon.* White Yarrow can be used to stop bleeding. 90% of the planet's syrup comes from Quebec. Which is in Canada. I know because it was in *Blades of Glory*.

The information she rattled off was alien to me. Sitting across from someone so excited and chatty was equally as foreign. Maybe my favorite new thing so far.

When I asked her about family, she just said “no outside relatives. I keep them close to my heart.” I had no idea what that meant but it sounded like lamentation, so I dropped it. I hadn’t brought up my mother either. 

I made a point to notice and file away all of her peculiar habits. I wanted to remember the way she liked things. Begin a translation catalog of speaking fluent *Maggie*, the way I know what my brothers are thinking. The noticing was easy, the decryption was not. I added to my list of firsts and discoveries: girls are *really* weird.

I reminded myself *I* was the fish out of water.

She orders water at room temperature, and stirred in sugar packets from her purse. She tilts her head at a sharp 45 degree angle when she’s scrutinizing. She is rigid straight when she is unsure. She prefers fruit overripe because it’s discounted. I think the savings give her some kind of dopamine hit. She blinks methodically and slowly. She dissects her food into tiny bites and doesn’t like to chew. She keeps her hands in her lap and crochets aggressively when waiting. She likes looking at her reflection in puddles. She doesn’t get too hot or cold. She’s hopelessly near-sighted but has incredible vision in the dark. Sometimes she feels for my face to pull me to the most visible distance. These moments where it feels like she’s looking down into me, they’re too much for me to take. All these things and a hundred other minor eccentricities of her Irish heritage. 

I walked her home. In front of her building, in a breath, we stood motionless under purring streetlamps. Maggie was holding my face in long fragile fingers, as we pulled away from my first kiss. I felt the veins in her palms writhe on my neck, or maybe that was my own nerves. This close she smelled like almond and lemon. My own heartbeat trying to climb up my brain stem.

“Do you… want to see my apartment?” Maggie said. She looked at me  with big, expectant, glossy green eyes. Like lily pad lidded ponds.

Unable to speak, I nodded like a marionette.

The greatest moment of my life was quickly followed by the most concerning. In retrospect, I had another *first* I hadn’t noticed at the time. As I stepped into her building, it was the first time I ignored the little voice in the back of my head. The one that argued maybe, possibly, I was following my boner over the edge of a fresh grave.

Lucidity took its time to return. As if an office worker named *Rationality* walked room to room turning the lights on in my consciousness, with slow Monday morning efficiency. The pipes running across her ceiling were loosely covered with a kaleidoscope tapestry. One thin window near the ceiling let in the only light. The window just big enough to show the ankles of a passerby. Everything else in the room was dim shapes. Somewhere in the Polaroid memory tangle of lips, skin and dark, I remembered when she bit my neck. I felt the sting, saliva and sweat on my body exposed to the air of her humid basement apartment. My still drumming heart mercifully began to slow. It felt resplendent but also like too much. Too raw, too exposing.

My thoughts were a traffic jam. I didn’t feel her get out of bed but I saw her outline, standing near the corner post on her side. She hugged herself and undulated slowly. I opened my mouth to say something but the words backed up in my throat like a cat in an open kennel.

Orange streetlight spilled in through the small rectangular window and washed over her bare shoulder blades. I heard no rain, but passing headlights rippled down her body like downpour. She slowly, with effort, began to twist, strain and bend with a series of clicks, increasing in speed and tone, like the sound of snapping progressively larger carrots. Something popped with a noise like de-boning chicken. She crumpled out of the light in two sharp movements like a twice snapped scarecrow.

Just beyond the dim beam of the window, I watched her bizarre feminine cleaning ritual. Afraid to blink, afraid to see. Disgust piled into my stomach and cozied up between the petite mort and post-nut-clarity. I fought back as the emotion attempted to work into my facial features. As appalled as I felt, I was still more terrified of rejection. Afraid that she might turn around and interpret my expression as an insult. Disgust at the intimacy she had just shared with me. I could only assume her vulnerability mirrored my own. I would not be a square peg seen passing judgment. I denied those feelings and witnessed her inconspicuous self imposed mangling, with as much composure as I could gather.

As she bent, her hands shot to her chest like the charades character of a T-Rex. From my vantage, it looked like she licked her bent back hands like a cat, her saliva spreading out over the limbs like shimmering black porridge. I automatically clutched where she bit me. Her double jointed limbs crackled as her position became more strained and impossible. She rubbed the lumpy oil slick into her hair and over her anatomy. It writhed like marching charcoal oatmeal over her body before it returned to her mouth, leaving trails of sweatless perfect skin in its wake. 

A counsel of little voices in my head argued vehemently against the singular one that screamed to run. Girls are weird. Don’t ruin this idiot. This is normal. Don’t be misogynist. They just don’t show this part in porn, that’s all.

She wrinkled into a human standing position, her extremities facing imprecise directions. With the climbing scratch of a wind-up toy, they all snapped into the correct place. She turned to me then, beaming. She was a satisfied smile cloaked in hair and shadow. 

She curled up against me then. Her whole body purring like a cat. In spite of everything I just saw, my neurology switch flipped from terrified to gallant. I am no longer just infected by Maggie, I am infected with her. My own body fights against the little voice that keeps insisting, and in moments like this, I am no longer on the side of my own self preservation.

“When you were a kid, did you ever think something was under the bed?” Maggie said.

“Ha, yeah. I’m pretty sure everybody with a bed did.”

Even in the dark, I could sense her smile as she pulled at the sheets. “Then you know the rule. Monsters can’t get you if you’re under the covers. So make sure you’re under the covers with me.”

We tangled impossibly, wrapping the sheets and duvet around us. Creating the spiritually impenetrable thread count barrier.

“Are you saying you *do* have monsters under your bed?” I scoffed.

“I'm saying…” She looked up at me for a moment, “I’m saying, what's outside the cocoon can’t get to us.”

She kissed me again and nuzzled her head against my chest. As if by pheromone spell I started to drift into sleep. A new anxiety began to breathe within. The idea that the world would come to take Maggie away from me, not the other way around. I held her closer, her hair was soft as silk. She smelled both sweat and acrid. Like a rotten candy apple. Even with the nightmares, I’ve never slept better.

That was 2 weeks ago. As time passes I become more alarmed at her behavior, and simultaneously more comfortable with that alarm. Then I’m watching her stand in the dark, drooling liquid marshmallows into the sink and my comfortability with it freaks me out too.

Every time I wake up without her, my hands phase through the ghost of her cooling indent in the mattress. Have I always been such an oblivious symbiote? What was it like for my father to lose this? On second thought, maybe he didn’t. Maybe nobody loses firsts. Would I rather my monster, or would I rather a ghost?

We made a compromise. She is gonna stop eating rotten fruit, and I am gonna stop living off old rye bread from the bakery downstairs.

Hypothetically, let's say she *is* some kind of unknowable lovecraftian 8th plague insect monster, would that mean we have to break up?

1qyajho,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1qyajho/endometriosis_adenomyosis_pregnant_but_unable_to/,"Endometriosis & Adenomyosis: Pregnant, but Unable to Carry a Baby","Hello dear community,
Today I am reaching out to you with a very emotional request — at the wish of my sister.
My sister and her husband dearly wish to have a child. Both are around 40 and, sadly, have already experienced several miscarriages. This has been incredibly difficult and emotionally exhausting for them.

After the first miscarriage, my sister was diagnosed with endometriosis as well as adenomyosis. She then underwent an endoscopic surgery during which lesions were removed. Since then, she has been receiving treatment at a fertility clinic, but even there, they are increasingly reaching their limits.

Her thyroid levels are checked regularly. A “too strong” immune system that might reject the embryo does not seem to be the cause either. Both the fertility clinic and her gynecologist are sometimes surprised, as she becomes pregnant with every attempt — but is never able to carry the pregnancy. The miscarriages always occurred between the 7th and 9th week of pregnancy. The heartbeat was present, everything seemed fine — and then suddenly, nothing.

For over two years now, she has further and consistently adapted her already healthy lifestyle: she completely avoids coffee and alcohol, eats very consciously, educates herself extensively, and follows everything with great discipline.
She is now increasingly worried that the cause may be her uterus itself — particularly in connection with adenomyosis.

Ultimately, what we are hoping for is a miracle. 

Therefore, my question to you: Are there women here who have endometriosis combined with adenomyosis, who have also experienced miscarriages — and who, in the end, still had a happy ending?
Do you have any experiences you would like to share?
Thank you very much for reading 🤍

1qyain6,https://v.redd.it/p04yx38fv1ig1,—Update—,"Tried again today, only difference is that I made sure to not have too much and too tightly packed coffee in the basket. Yesterday I recall tapping the basket after having filled it to even it out, but then it sunk down a bit too much I felt like, so filled up with a bit more coffee. The poor has always been slow and ”favored” one opening over the other. I pre-boil water and use two aero-press filters. The coffee was a gift, classic ground coffee by Bialetti for the mocapot. Usually grind beans before each brew so might be that I’m just a bit unfamiliar with the drier stuff",11,1770460303.0,mokapot,2,1.0,False
1qyailu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qyailu,[Haul] 3 weeks of real wear: 8 pieces that actually lived with me,"After subway commutes, spilled coffee, and one rainy Tuesday that tested everything—I’m sharing exactly how these held up. Zero brand ties. Just honest notes.

Off-White x Nike Air Jordan 1 Low
Heel arrow catches platform light just right. Lost the zip-tie lace lock by day five—minor hassle, but wearing the remaining one loose feels more me now.

Nike Air Jordan 1 Low ""Pine Green""
Velvet upper shrugged off a cold brew splash. Wiped clean with a napkin. Swapped to red laces for weekend hangs—quiet refresh.

Balenciaga Logo Spray Hoodie
Fabric softened nicely after washes. Hood depth saves bad hair days. Red stripe under logo? Barely visible unless someone’s close—intentional subtlety.

Off-White Industrial Zip Hoodie
Drawstrings faded slightly, looks naturally broken-in. Silver arrow on back caught store light during a late-night errand. Clerk nodded. Felt good.

AMIRI Distressed Hoodie
Held up through a packed show. Checked the tears afterward—stitching intact. Distressing feels earned, not fragile.

Chrome Hearts Cross Hoodie
Heavyweight cotton = zero chill waiting for the train. Embroidered crosses have subtle texture. Ran my thumb over them while waiting—oddly grounding.

Balenciaga Flame Print Jeans
Wide leg hides lazy days. Print softened noticeably after two washes (I prefer the muted look now, but heads up if you want bold graphics). Do not bike in these—fabric doesn’t give where it counts.

Hellstar Track Pants
""30"" on the side glows faintly in dark hallways. Found my keys faster last night. For the price? Thoughtful detail that lands.

Clothes don’t need to be perfect. Just need one reason you reach for them again.
What’s your current quiet MVP? Or a piece that looked fire online but fell flat IRL?
