1m73l88,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentTexts/comments/1m73l88/the_echoes_that_stay/,The Echoes That Stay.,"It’s been two weeks.

I’ve deleted Instagram. I’ve distanced myself from everything that used to pull me back in. And still, somehow, I find myself checking WhatsApp. Just to see if there’s a message waiting. Just to see if maybe, for once, the silence ends with your name lighting up on my screen.

I know how ridiculous that sounds.

But the truth is, I think about you every day. Not in the same sharp, aching way I used to… but in quiet flashes. In songs I can’t skip. In late-night thoughts I don’t know how to silence. In coffee cups and empty seats and passing laughter that sounds a little too familiar.

It’s strange — how some people stay in your system long after they’ve left your life.

I’ve tried to move forward. Tried to let it all drift into the background like some half-remembered dream. But some memories? They don’t fade. They haunt gently. They linger. And I think the hardest part isn’t even missing you.

It’s missing the version of me that existed when you were around.

I was softer. More open. Hopeful, even. And now? Now I’m learning how to build a version of myself without waiting for you to be part of it.

This isn’t a plea. This isn’t a hope that you’ll suddenly appear with answers or apologies. I’m not writing this for you anymore.

I’m writing this for me — for the boy who loved with everything he had, even if it went unnoticed. For the boy who still checks his phone, even knowing better.

Maybe someday I’ll stop doing that too.

But not today.

They’re not that expensive, super sustainable, gorgeous interiors, take out cups are mad good quality, and the coffee is just so flavourful. I often struggle to really taste the notes coffee shops claim, but they have really bold and distinct flavours. And their patisserie?? Next level. In looks and flavour.

I unfortunately have to choose between the man I want to spend my life with and my parents. Maybe if I set boundaries it would be all right but every time I try I always give up .my father doesn't work...he haven't had a job in 10 years, I am 23 and since I remembered it was like that and the worst is that my father is a manchild .I remember my family to function depending on my father's feelings and mood and for a little girl that ment in my subconscious thet he is more important. We never had a lot of money my mother is a janitor in a supermarket and we had the help of my grandparents whose I lost 4 years ago .since then I am like the father of the family emotionally to my other 3 younger siblings and financially. I work since 17 and never kept a dime and I was stupid for that .The thing is that my father smokes and drink coffee, his addiction is really bad ,if he doesn't do those for more than 2 days he is irritated he curses and says we are ungrateful if we don't give him money for that . After I usually step back then everything is ok in his eyes even if i don't trust him anymore even if the bubble of the perfect funny father has burst even if I don't have 20 euros until 15 days for the next paycheck. My boyfriend doesn't like any of these and is normal ...I would feel the same if I was him . He says that he wants a life to build together to do whatever we like ...and I would like that too, but in the end I lie to him about the money I give to my family I lie about my feelings if something happened at home and I am tired of telling him that . I feel like I hold him back cause I know that the situation with my family is not going to change ...I cannot find the courage to change it .
*Some details: my father is a manchild for those reason->he always asks for help for anything like getting him a plate of food or make him coffee , he is the father but he doesn't understand he doesn't act like one ...fun and games are good but I cannot trur him anymore .besides being poor I would say that's not our problem ,the problem is that my mom's salary is 800euros mine as well and renting a house for 400 , electric bill etc are not enough and my father can't hold back on cigarettes and coffee..we give like 300 euros for that . When I Firstly started dating my boyfriend he wouldn't understand our boundaries in personal time , he would call like 5 times in 2 hours, I would sleep in my boyfriend's and he would call at 7 in the morning to tell me he needs money for cigarettes .he curses if something doesn't go his way and lastly he haven't find a job in 3 years .now that he is 57 he remembered to apply for a job he didn't get and only cause I told him that I need to have my own life ...he ""tried "" now ...why not the other 10 years that he was younger ? 
About mom ->she does whatever she can that's all I can tell but her big mistake is that she unintentionally supported all that behavior ..if I was her I would divorce him for the sake of the children. 
About 2 younger siblings-> they are 13 and 16 so they cannot help in the situation financially
About my 20 year old brother->he tries to do his own life and in that way I am the one that has everything to do . He gives like 200euros while I give almost 400 every month even if I don't live with my family I live with my boyfriend . I talked to him many times and he seem to doesn't care that I have all that burden in the meantime I cannot blame him either. 
About me-> I am a people's pleaser I cannot say no and it's eating the life out of me . I am a flight attendant my boyfriend helped me get that degree he helped me put some basic boundaries to my family .
Back to the story 
The rest of my family understand my boundaries and that I want to build a life ,I don't have a problem to give an amount of money to help but my father doesn't stop with coffee and cigarettes...those money are a lot for us .If I was able to say no I would do it but then hw calls me crying for money or he makes me feel guilty and in the end I cannot say no .It hurts me that my own father cannon put his needs aside for his child ,I hold him I am tired I take medication for stress I have 2 small tumors in my neck made from stress.
Why my own father ...and I keep saying yes cause I think that things will get better but I don't know what I am waiting anymore .
My boyfriend wants to take a new job in another city he asked me if anything is going to change from now on ...I don't know. Should I break up with him and stop trying and accept that my family is never going to change or should I set some boundaries with my family and live with my boyfriend to try and make my own life ?",1,1753258522.0,u_ThinSignificance444,0,1.0,False
1m73ju1,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1m73ju1/i_fell_for_the_one_woman_i_shouldnt_have_and_she/,I fell for the one woman I shouldn’t have and she let me. (26M / 42F),"I live in New York. And recently, I crossed a line I never thought I’d even approach, with someone I’ve known most of my life.

She’s not my mom. Not blood. She used to be married to my dad.
Her name is Leila. And she’s… a lot.

Leila is 42. Blonde hair like an old movie star, the kind that falls perfectly around her shoulders without ever trying too hard. She has a body that turns heads even in oversized coats. Classic hourglass figure. Full hips, long legs, and this ridiculous, beautiful ass that makes you forget whatever sentence you were about to say. She never showed off, but she didn’t need to. It was just part of her, like gravity.

When I was a teenager, of course I noticed. I wasn’t blind. But I kept my distance, emotionally and mentally. She was married to my dad at the time, and I had boundaries, even if my imagination didn’t.

After their divorce, she stayed in the city. I left. Traveled, grew up, chased jobs and dreams. We didn’t talk for years.

A few weeks ago, I moved back to New York. I texted her.
“Coffee?”
She replied, “Come by. I make a mean espresso.”

She opened the door in a soft knit sweater and leggings, barefoot, no makeup. And still the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.

The second I stepped in, I could feel the air was different. Not awkward, just heavy, like we were both standing on the edge of something we weren’t naming.

We talked for a while. About life, the city, people who disappeared and people who stuck around. She poured wine. She asked why I really wanted to see her.

I told her the truth.
“I wanted to see if you were real, or just a memory I made too perfect.”

She smiled at me, that slow kind of smile that makes your chest tighten. Then she said,
“I’m very real, Kai. The question is, do you still want me, now that you know?”

That was it. That was the moment everything shifted.

I told her I used to watch her. Not in some creepy, teenage way, just with fascination. She had this quiet magnetism. The way she walked through a room. The way she leaned against the kitchen counter and listened when you talked. It wasn’t about lust back then, not entirely. It was just this pull I didn’t know how to name.

She looked at me and said,
“You think I didn’t notice the way you looked at me? You were a boy. But now…”

She didn’t finish the sentence. She didn’t need to.

I kissed her first, slow and uncertain, like I was asking a question. She answered by leaning in and gripping my shirt, and from that moment on, we stopped pretending.

We didn’t tear each other’s clothes off. We took our time. Her skin was warm and smooth, her body soft in all the right ways. Her curves felt unreal under my hands. That ass I used to steal glances at? I got to trace every inch of it with my lips. It wasn’t fast or frantic. It was slow, deliberate, like we had waited long enough.

She gave herself to me completely. And I gave her every part of myself I didn’t even know I had been saving.

We woke up just before sunrise. Her bedroom faced the skyline, and the light hit her hair like gold. She looked at me, her voice still sleepy, and said,
“You’re still here.”
I nodded and said,
“I told you I would be.”

We haven’t labeled it. Maybe we never will. But I know this.

I’ve been with women my age. They’re fun. But Leila? She knows who she is. She knows what she wants. She doesn’t guess, she chooses. And being chosen by her? That changes you.

So yeah, that’s my confession. Make of it what you want.

1m73ji0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1m73ji0/i_work_night_shifts_alone_but_something_else/,"I work night shifts alone, but something else clocks in with me","You know that feeling when you're the only one in a building? That hum of silence, the echo of your own footsteps? It's weirdly peaceful. That's what I thought, anyway. I took a night shift job as a courier facility supervisor. Nothing glamorous. I sit at a desk, monitor some security feeds, make rounds every two hours. The pay's not bad, and I liked the idea of being alone for a while. No coworkers, no noise. Just me, and the hum.

That was a mistake.

I started two months ago. First few nights, nothing strange. I even brought books to read. The warehouse has four main areas: the loading dock, storage, main hallway, and admin office. Security feeds cycle through them. The cameras are old—grainy black and white, with a bit of lag—but they did the job.

On my ninth night, something changed. It was subtle. Something I wouldn't have noticed if I wasn’t already tired and zoning out. At 2:34 AM, the hallway camera glitched. It only lasted a second. A little blur. But when the feed came back, there was something on the floor. Just a dark smear. I went to check it out.

The hallway smelled wrong. Like burnt copper. And the smear? It looked like something had been dragged**.** But the floor was dry, and no one else was supposed to be here. I checked the entire building. All the doors were still locked. Motion sensors inactive. I wrote it off as a glitch. Maybe a leak. Maybe the night just plays tricks on tired eyes.

But the next night, it happened again. Same time. 2:34 AM. Same blur. This time the smear was longer. Reaching the edge of the hallway, like something was being pulled further each time. I reported it to my supervisor. He looked at the footage, scratched his chin, and said, ""That's been happening for years. Just ignore it."" 

Years. I asked if there was any history to the building. He shrugged. ""All I know is, don't follow it. That's what the last guy did."" I wanted to press him, but he clammed up. I should’ve left then. I should’ve never come back. I did some digging. The last night guard? His name was Jason. Disappeared in 2017. No official word. They said he quit without notice, left all his things behind. Even his lunch was still in the fridge.

I found his locker. Still had his badge inside. And a little notebook. Most of the entries were mundane. ""2:00 AM - Checked loading dock. All clear."" ""2:15 AM - Drank vending machine coffee. Bitter."" But the last few pages? They changed. ""2:34 AM. There it is again."" ""It moved closer. I think it knows I see it."" ""Last night it was at the corner. Tonight, it was at the door. I didn’t open it. I didn’t open it. I won’t."" ""If someone finds this, DON’T LET IT IN.""

The writing got shaky by the end. I took the notebook with me. Showed it to my boss. He told me to destroy it. I didn’t. I don’t think I can. A week later, everything changed. It didn’t wait for 2:34 anymore. The cameras started flickering at random. I'd be watching the loading dock, then static, and suddenly—eyes**.** Right up to the lens. Black, reflective, wet. Gone in a blink. Sometimes I hear breathing in the main hallway. Loud, slow, wet breathing. But when I check the mic feed, there’s nothing.

I started locking the office door. I bring a crowbar now. I don’t feel alone anymore. Two nights ago, I fell asleep on the desk. Only for a minute. When I woke up, someone had written on the monitor in black marker: ""YOU SEE ME."" I checked the cameras. The hallway feed showed a figure—blurry, almost like the lens couldn’t focus on it. Like static had a body.

It was just standing there. Not moving, not blinking. Facing the camera. I watched it for four hours. It didn’t move. At the end of my shift, it was gone. Last night, I found footprints. Black, heavy ones. Leading from the storage area to the office door. My office door. But the cameras showed nothing.

I stayed inside and didn’t breathe. Something brushed the door, slow and deliberate. Like the caress of a hand. Then it stopped. When I opened the door at sunrise, there was another message on the wall. ""TOMORROW."" That’s tonight. I don’t know what to do. I’m sitting in the chair now. It’s almost 2:34 AM. The hallway feed is fine. But my reflection in the screen? It’s smiling. I’m not.

I don’t know what it wants, but I know it’s coming. And I think when it gets here, I won’t be allowed to leave either. Please. If you find this post, don’t take the job. Don’t reply to the listing. Don’t be curious. Don’t come looking. Just let me stay here. Let it end with me. Because something else clocks in with me every night.

It’s a cousin, or a family friends basement. 

It’s the early 2000’s, no later than 2009. (I would’ve been 8 or younger, which is weird that I can remember it so vividly.)

The stairs into the basement descend and turn right to make it to the main basement room.

The walls weren’t wood paneled, but they were painted a dark color, maybe red or brown or something? Or even one wall *was* wood paneled, and the rest were painted? 

The carpet is a very light color, maybe white or beige, near the running boards at the bottom there are slight drips from where the paint was applied poorly. 

There is a massive (likely a 40-50”) flat screen TV with a gaming console hooked up, could’ve been an Xbox 360, but I think it was PS2 or PS3, because Jax and Daxter or Ratchet and Clank was/is loaded up, one of those buddy character platformer  adventure games that was really popular.

the overhead light is bright LED white when on, but almost always turned off. The entire basement is lit by a couple of table lamps by the couch and the TV.

There is a home entertainment system that houses the TV and Console. Surround sound speakers are in the corners of the basement, as well as next to the TV. 

The couch is one of those ultra plush red velvety feeling couches, and to either side an end table. Directly in front is a cheap coffee table.

The coffee table was one of those ones that had a glass top, and the inner section had a couple TV/entertainment system remote control baskets and console controllers. 

There is a *bunch* of shelves along the home entertainment system, and the walls, housing hundreds of DVD’s, VHS’s, and video games.

There is a cheap wooden door separating the basement from a bedroom, and just beyond that is a bathroom. I don’t remember because I was never allowed in that part of the basement.

it’s an almost perfect memory that I cannot explain why it suddenly started appearing It’s not so much nostalgia, but it’s like something I want to recreate.

I know this is a bit of a weird thing to share, but alcohol and sleepiness has fused together in the perfect level of confidence(?) or conviction(?) that would vibe well with people here who also have memories of a similar room that just calls to their subconscious.

Hey everyone,
I'm (45F) a bit new to sharing here, but navigating perimenopause has truly been a rollercoaster, especially feeling a bit isolated despite having a supportive family. It's made me realize how much I miss having a core group of like-minded friends who just get it.

This personal experience has sparked an an idea, and I'd love to hear your honest thoughts on it.

If there was an online community designed specifically for women navigating perimenopause, focused on:
 - Finding genuine friends and a true ""circle"" of support (beyond just online acquaintances)
 - A safe space to share stories and realize ""it's not just me""
 - Getting answers to your struggles (through shared experiences and expert insights)
...and this community also offered the option for local meetups (e.g., coffee, walks, casual get-togethers) in your area to build those deeper, in-person connections:
1. Would you value something like this?
2. What aspects would be most appealing or necessary for you?
3. What are your biggest hesitations or concerns about a community like this?
I'm really trying to understand if this is a shared need, and your input would be incredibly valuable as I explore this concept further.

Thanks so much for your time and honesty!

Here’s the breakdown based on in-hand feel, fit, and first impressions. Most tees are TTS, but always check seller measurements just in case.

Godspeed New York Short Sleeves
Wasn’t sure at first, but this hits. Slight street-prep blend with the Godspeed NYC graphic — fabric’s soft with nice weight. Clean neck and sleeve stitching.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7503015281

Ami Shirt
Crisp button-up feel, slightly relaxed cut. Embroidered logo feels premium, not a glued patch. Great summer shirt — doesn’t scream “designer,” but gives quiet flex.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7494176359

Balenciaga Short Sleeves
Boxy and bold. Fabric’s heavy with a dry-touch texture, and the print is clean — nothing sloppy. It’s oversized by design, so size down if you don’t want the drop-shoulder look.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7502531665

Stüssy White Short Sleeves
Classic surfer-skater Stüssy vibe. Clean logo hit on white, comfy tee with a nice drape. This one’s easy to throw on with cargos or denim.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7501706350

Sleek and understated. Black tee with sharp font logo — feels like an elevated basic. TTS but the length runs slightly longer than standard.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7510958053

Drew House Short Sleeves
Fun, cartoon-vibe tee with nice softness. Fits boxy but still flattering. The smiley logo’s clean — not oversized or peeling. Definitely a chill-day fit.

W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7504057042

Chrome Hearts Plaid Shorts
Super cozy with a subtle CH flex. Fabric feels more flannel than mesh — good for cooler evenings. Waistband has enough stretch, fit is slightly roomy.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7500632577

Gallery Dept Yellow T-shirt
Definitely loud. Dye job looks intentional, print holds up after first wash. Fit is boxy, sleeves drop low. Very streetwear, not for minimalist days.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7499835647

Ape White T-shirt
Thick and durable tee with classic BAPE logo. Fit is a little cropped and sleeves are wide — great with cargos or double-knee pants.

Acne Studios Short Sleeves
Minimalism done right. Logo is tiny and clean, fabric’s light but smooth. This is one of those wear-anywhere pieces — coffee shop or night out.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7490790932

Ape Short Sleeves
Bold camo styling and classic Ape graphics. Print pops, and material is breathable. Slightly tight at the shoulders, so size up if you lift or want comfort.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7508850578

Gucci Short Sleeves
Logomania vibes but not too overdone. The fabric feels silky-soft, stitching looks decent. This one toes the line between streetwear and luxury well.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7513921290

Red Short Sleeves
This one’s simple but hits. Solid red with small logo text — gives Uniqlo x streetwear energy. Easy daily tee. Not the softest, but no complaints.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7504530328

Godspeed New York Short Sleeves (Repost)
Wanted to try a second colorway — same notes as above. Steezy cut, clean logo, comfy tee. Pairs well with baggy shorts or carpenter pants.
W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7503015281

Burberry Beach Shorts

He was the Alpha I’d loved all my life—the one I thought would mark me, marry me, make me his Luna. Instead, he held another she-wolf in his arms and called her his future. Then he looked at me, the girl he destroyed, and sneered, “How much do you want? I’ll pay. One billion?” I smiled through the ache. “One dollar. That’s all I ask.” And with that, I walked away—forever. He thought I was cheap. But he just lost everything. “I’ve made up my mind, Edmund. I’m leaving the pack. I’m moving to Europe.”

On the other end of the line, Edmund—Rachel’s longtime mentor and a rogue elder—chuckled warmly. “Took you long enough! With your talent, you should’ve crossed the sea years ago. You’d be an internationally renowned lens-witch by now.”

Rachel offered a strained smile. “That’s kind of you to say. Thank you, Edmund.”

“So, when can I expect you here? I’ve met a few fashion magazine editors in Milan recently—they’ve seen your portfolio and are dying to meet the wolf behind the lens.”

She paused. “Give me two weeks. There are still things I need to settle within the territory.”

“Fair enough,” he said. “Your brother’s always been overly protective. I can’t imagine Alpha Aaron will be thrilled about his sister leaving pack lands alone. You’d better sit him down and say it with bite.”

After hanging up, Rachel’s gaze drifted to the pair across the boutique.

A woman was twirling in front of the mirror, wrapped in lace and silk—yet somehow, it was her scent that made Rachel’s stomach twist. The woman glowed, laughing, radiant in the giddy haze of a future Luna. And beside her stood a man—tall, commanding, his dark gaze soft as he watched her.

Aaron.

Rachel let out a bitter breath of laughter.

He had always been that way with her, once. Always present. Always near.

Even Luna Emily, their mother and the revered matriarch of their bloodline, used to tease, “What kind of Alpha clings to his sister’s scent like that? Wolves are going to start thinking you’re bonded.”

Aaron had just raised an eyebrow, his voice mild, but his eyes—gods, his eyes—had never wavered from Rachel. “Let them think what they want.”

She’d been stunned, back then. Flushed. Her heart had howled with something it couldn’t name. And when she looked up and met his gaze—steady, unwavering, impossibly tender—something inside her cracked open like a howl against the moon.

Wolves lived for fleeting moments like that.

And that moment became the sweetest—and cruelest—memory of Rachel’s life.

She waited for him to cross the line. Just one step. Just one growled word to claim her.

If he had, she would have said yes.

But that moment never came.

Instead, he turned his eyes—and his scent—toward someone else.

Sierra. His beta. A female beta.

She still remembered the day he handed her that stack of files.

“Rachel, help me pick one.”

She’d blinked. “Didn’t you already have a beta?”

“I need a female beta,” he said evenly. “Someone who can look after you. Adam’s great, but... he’s a male. It wouldn’t be proper.”

Something about it felt off. Her instincts twitched beneath her skin.

“I don’t really know how to choose a beta,” she said. “Ask Adam. He knows the ranks better than I do.”

But Aaron was firm. “You’ll be seeing her a lot. Might as well choose someone whose energy suits yours.”

So she chose Sierra.

She thought she was choosing a guard. A protector.

She didn’t realize she was choosing Aaron’s future mate.

“Rachel!”

Sierra’s voice carried across the boutique—light, sweet, and laced with triumph.

“Come help me decide! What do you think of this one? Your brother’s useless—he says they all look good. So not helpful.”

Rachel managed a breath. “It’s your mating gown. If you like it, that’s what matters.”

Sierra pouted. “You know I didn’t grow up surrounded by designer silks or Luna elegance. I just don’t want to wear something that makes Aaron look bad. But you—you have the Luna’s eye. You literally make beauty happen for a living.”

“I know how to frame a shot,” Rachel said stiffly. “Not a Luna ceremony.”

Sierra’s expression faltered, just for a beat. “Rachel… you still haven’t accepted me, have you?”

Rachel opened her mouth—but no words came out.

It wasn’t about Sierra.

It was about the man who used to hold Rachel like she was the only scent in the world worth chasing… now standing at another’s side.

“Aaron,” Sierra said softly, her tone carefully measured, “go check on Rachel. I think she’s still hurt about what happened last time.”

“She’s not,” Aaron replied, voice cool.

“It was my fault,” Sierra insisted. “I misread the moment. Maybe we should postpone the mating ceremony. Just until she’s ready to bless our union.”

Aaron frowned. “We can’t postpone a Luna binding because Rachel’s upset.”

“But she’s your blood. Her blessing… it matters to me.”

Aaron was silent. Then he turned, expression unreadable, and walked toward Rachel.

His voice, when it came, was colder than frost. “Still sulking over last time?”

Rachel turned away. “I’m not.”

“You threw your arms around me in front of Sierra. She misunderstood—and who wouldn’t? What kind of grown she-wolf launches herself at her Alpha like that? You should know better.”

The quiet sting of disapproval was worse than a claw to the chest.

Once upon a time, Aaron had clung to her scent like it was his anchor. If she took even a step away, he’d pull her back to his side. No one questioned it—not even Rachel.

When she trekked north to photograph snow-capped mountains, he followed.

When she flew to the savannahs of Africa for a wolf-conservation project, he was right there, walking the perimeter at night, guarding her tent.

He used to say, “Wherever you go, I’ll always be behind you. Just turn around.”

That day, her photo series won gold. Overwhelmed, she’d embraced him—because how could she not? He was her pack, her spine, her shadow.

And Sierra had walked in.

Since that moment, Aaron had changed.

Distant. Guarded. Cold.

Rachel drew a shaky breath. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make things awkward. If it upset her, I’ll be more careful next time.”

Aaron nodded once. “Good. As long as you understand.”

“I do,” she whispered. “You two keep looking at gowns. I’m not feeling well—I’ll head out.”

She turned on her heel and left the boutique.

Tears blurred her vision.

She wiped them away, furious with herself. With her weakness. With her wolf’s stupid ache.

Then she pulled out her phone.

And booked a plane ticket.

Two weeks from now, she’d be gone.

Gone from this pack.

Gone from her brother.

Gone from the only man she ever dared to love.

Rachel didn’t get back to home until nearly dawn.

Deciding to leave had only taken a second. But walking away from over twenty years of memories? That wasn’t something she could just flip off like a switch.

She wasn’t that strong—not yet.

Which is why, in the two weeks before her flight, she planned to avoid Aaron as much as possible. Just to make sure she wouldn’t change her mind.

When she stepped into the house, the place was pitch black.

She didn’t bother turning on the lights. Her body ached with exhaustion as she quietly made her way toward the stairs.

But before she could reach her room, a voice stopped her from the living room.

“Rachel.”

She turned and spotted a figure lounging on the couch.

Sierra.

“Need something?” Rachel asked flatly.

Sierra was draped across the arm of the sofa in a black lace camisole, her posture deliberately relaxed, seductive even. Her lips curled into a soft smile. “Aaron picked this one out for me. Do you like it?”

As she slowly sat up, the dim light caught the red marks scattered across her collarbone and waist—faint but unmistakable, made more striking against the sheer black fabric.

She touched one of the marks on her neck and let out a syrupy little wince. “Ow… your brother has terrible taste in wedding gowns, but he sure knows how to pick out lingerie. He said seeing me in this nearly drove him insane.”

Rachel stood at the foot of the stairs, unmoving. Her eyes narrowed. She looked down at Sierra with cool detachment, then gave her a cold, amused smile.

“Sierra,” she said dryly, “dial it back. You’re starting to reek.”

Sierra blinked innocently. “Reek of what?”

Rachel tilted her head. “Desperation. And something else. Starts with an S.”

Sierra let out a delighted little laugh. “S1utty, you mean? Can’t help it—your brother loves it when I’m like this. The second he got home, he all but begged me to change into this. And then…”

“I don’t need the play-by-play,” Rachel jumped in. “Spare me.”

“Whether you want to hear it or not, it’s still the truth,” Sierra said, voice coated in sugar. “He’s obsessed with my body, Rachel. Whatever history you two have? Doesn't matter. At the end of the day, men always choose what turns them on.”

Rachel turned to leave. “You’ve had your moment. I’m not sticking around for the encore.”

But Sierra wasn’t done. She jumped up, lifting the hem of her lace slip as she followed after her. “Oh come on, don’t walk away yet. You didn’t get a good look, did you? The marks he left? They’re all over—”

She reached for Rachel’s arm.

Rachel yanked away instinctively, nausea crawling up her throat. “Don’t touch me.”

At that exact moment, Aaron stepped out of the bedroom, a glass of milk still in hand.

His brows lifted. “What’s going on out here?”

Rachel opened her mouth to speak—but Sierra was faster.

She spun toward him, flashing Rachel one last look.

A smirk.

And then—scream.

Rachel barely processed it before Sierra stumbled backward and fell straight down the stairs.

“Sierra!” Aaron dropped the glass and rushed over, catching her just as she hit the last step.

He pulled her into his arms, cradling her like something fragile.

“Are you okay?”

Sierra looked up at him, breath shaky, lips trembling. “I’m fine. Just… don’t blame Rachel. It wasn’t on purpose.”

Aaron’s head snapped toward Rachel, eyes blazing with something between disbelief and anger.

“Rachel. I don’t care how much you hate her—pushing someone down the stairs? Are you out of your mind? Do you have any idea how dangerous that was?!”

His voice softened the second he looked back at Sierra, his expression laced with worry.

“Let’s get you back to the room,” he murmured. “I need to check you for injuries.”

Sierra flushed and buried her face against his chest. “Maybe we shouldn’t be so affectionate in front of Rachel from now on. It’s only natural for a sister to feel possessive… You were hers for so long, and now there’s me. I can’t imagine how hard that must be for her.”

Aaron’s jaw tightened. “She’ll have to get used to it.”

He stood, lifting Sierra easily into his arms.

As he carried her back to their room, Sierra peeked over his shoulder—and flashed Rachel a smug little V for victory.

Rachel stood frozen in place, her chest hollow.

This house didn’t feel like home anymore.

It felt like a place where she no longer belonged.

Sierra hadn’t just taken Aaron.

She’d torn her world apart and danced on the ruins.

Rachel couldn’t understand it.

How could Aaron fall for someone like her? Did Sierra hit the point?

Was it really just about lust? About who made his blood boil?

Rachel didn’t know. And at this point, she didn’t want to.

The next morning, Rachel headed to the magazine office.

She’d worked here for three years as a featured photographer, and over time, the place had become a second home. The people, her teammates—they were more than just coworkers.

When Gwen, the editor-in-chief, received her resignation letter, she looked genuinely caught off guard. “Is this about your salary? Because if that’s the issue, just say the word—I’ll talk to the executive director myself.”

Rachel shook her head with a faint smile. “Thanks, Gwen. It’s not about the money.”

“Then what is it?”

“I’ve just… got other plans. A different direction I need to follow.”

Gwen paused, and then her lips curled into a knowing grin. “Ah. You’re finally marrying Aaron and stepping into your Luna era, huh? Well, I can’t say I’m surprised. Alpha’s been picking you up from work every day, rain or shine. You’ve always been the center of his world. If anyone deserves to be his Luna, it’s you. I won’t try to talk you out of it.”

Rachel froze for a moment.

She’d intended to clarify. Aaron was holding a mating ceremony soon—just not with her.

But the moment Gwen finished talking, the urge to explain simply vanished.

What was the point?

There was no neat way to untangle the mess between her, Aaron, and Sierra. No quick summary that wouldn’t make her look foolish—or worse, pathetic.

Right now, she just wanted to tie up loose ends and disappear. Quietly. Cleanly. Two weeks, and she’d be gone.

“Oh! One more thing,” Gwen added, cheerful as ever. “What date’s the ceremony? Make sure I get an invite—I want to raise a glass to my favorite couple!”

Rachel gave a polite, awkward smile and said nothing.

Luckily, at that moment, the front desk receptionist, Meg, poked her head through the door, beaming.

“Rachel! Your mate’s here again—and he brought a surprise!”

Rachel stepped outside the office building and immediately spotted Aaron leaning against his black Cullinan, head tilted down like he was deep in thought.

She walked closer, and then she saw it.

The “surprise” Meg had mentioned.

The entire backseat and trunk of his SUV—every inch of it—was overflowing with roses. Bright crimson. Dozens, maybe hundreds, so tightly packed that the scent practically spilled into the street.

Only the passenger seat had been left empty.

Behind her, she heard whispers and stifled giggles. A few of her coworkers were pressed up against the lobby windows, half-hiding behind the blinds as they peeked out at the scene, nudging each other like giddy teenagers.

Aaron had done things like this before.

Sometimes he brought her cupcakes. Sometimes a favorite latte or random snacks she liked. The little gestures had become routine over the years.

Her coworkers had come to expect it—and more than once, they’d tease her with mock envy.

“Rachel’s Alpha strikes again,” they’d whisper.

“It’s like Uber Eats, but free.”

Rachel had never denied it. She’d laugh along and share whatever he brought, letting them believe what they wanted.

But today was different.

She could already imagine them waiting to split the flowers—fighting over who got to take home the prettiest bouquet.

She stepped forward. “Aaron.”

He looked up, but his face was unreadable—cold, even. His tone matched it.

“Don’t call me that anymore. Use ‘Alpha.’”

Rachel blinked, caught off guard. Then, after a pause, she nodded slowly. “Got it. Alpha.”

Aaron’s expression softened just slightly. “About last night… I was too harsh. Don’t take it personally.”

“Sure,” she said.

Aaron pressed, “But seriously, Rachel—what were you thinking? Someone could’ve gotten really hurt.”

Rachel’s head snapped up, eyes widened with disbelief—then she let out a short, breathy laugh, one that held no humor at all.

“So this is why you came? To judge me?”

Aaron’s jaw tightened. “You still don’t think you were out of line?”

She stared at him. Disbelief turning into anger, sharp and sudden. “You’ve known me for over twenty years. And you really think I’d push her—in our own house—like I’m that stupid?”

Rachel snapped.

The words came out sharper than she meant, fueled by frustration she could barely contain.

And the moment they did, regret settled in.

What was the point?

She was leaving. Nothing she said now would change anything.

She exhaled slowly. “Forget it. Just go. I’ve got work to do.”

As she headed back toward the office doors, the laughter and teasing from moments earlier had died down. Her coworkers, who’d just been giggling behind the glass, were suddenly quiet. Their expressions had shifted—curious, concerned.

“Rachel, everything okay? Did you guys get into a fight?”

“Yeah, don’t be mad,” one of them said. “A car full of roses? The man’s basically waving a white flag. Just... hear him out?”

Rachel kept her face unreadable and murmured, “You all should get back to work.”

Her voice wasn’t harsh, but it was firm.

And they listened.

Rachel wasn’t just some coworker. She was the photographer around here—sharp, professional, respected. The younger girls admired her. Respected her.

So, with a few awkward glances and murmured “sorry”s, the group quietly slipped back inside.

All except Meg.

Meg, who’d been closest to Rachel since the day she joined, tugged at her sleeve and whispered, “Hey… can I grab one of those roses? I saw the whole trunk full. I even brought vases.”

Rachel sighed. “I’ll buy you some. I’m not letting your vase sit empty, promise.”

Back at her desk, her focus was shot.

She forced herself to edit a few photos from last week’s shoot, but her mind wasn’t in it.

Then her phone buzzed—messages form Sierra.

Sierra: [Which one do you like best?]

Three photos. Three different sets of lingerie—or rather, barely there sleepwear. Lacy, sheer, suggestive.

More skin than fabric. And none of it subtle.

Seconds later, the messages disappeared.

Sierra: [Oops, sorry! Wrong person]

Rachel stared at the screen.

Turned it off.

Tossed it into her drawer and slammed it shut.

They both knew well it wasn’t a mistake.

Sierra had meant for her to see it.

The hours dragged by. She didn’t check her phone again until the office lights started dimming and people began leaving for the night.

She turned it back on.

No missed calls.

No texts.

Nothing.

Not long ago, if she didn’t reply to Aaron within thirty minutes, he’d call, text, or show up in person. No matter what time it was.

Now? Radio silence.

Her social feed had a few notifications.

She opened it—and the first post that popped up stopped her cold.

A photo.

Aaron’s Cullinan, same black SUV as always, trunk still overflowing with roses. And Sierra, standing in front of it, cradling a bouquet, beaming like she owned the world.

The caption read: “Thanks, my babe. Best birthday gift ever.”

So today was Sierra’s birthday.

Those flowers weren’t meant for Rachel.

Not the roses. Not the passenger seat. Not anymore.

After work, Rachel didn’t want to go back to the packhouse.

But then Luna Emily called.

“Sweetheart,” the Luna said warmly, “you’ve been working so late lately. I worry about you out there alone. I’ll send Aaron to come pick you up, okay?”

“No, it’s fine,” Rachel replied quickly. “I’ll just take a cab home.”

There was no way she was getting into that SUV again.

Not when the seat beside him and the backseat full of flowers belonged to someone else.

Emily hesitated, then softened. “Alright, just… be careful, okay?”

“Always.”

When Rachel arrived home, both Aaron and Sierra were already there.

Sierra stood in the hallway with a giant suitcase, just stepping out of Rachel’s room.

“Hey, you’re back!” she chirped.

Rachel’s heart slammed into her ribs.

“You went in my room?”

Sierra blinked in surprise, but before she could answer, Aaron’s voice cut through the space like a blade.

“I told her to.”

He walked out from the kitchen, setting his glass down a little too hard on the table.

Rachel turned toward him, stunned. “You had no right.”

“She’s going to be Luna,” Aaron said calmly. “That means she has access to any room she wants.”

And just like that, Rachel felt like someone had poured a bucket of ice water down her spine.

Sierra stepped closer, voice all honey and softness. “Aaron, don’t say it like that. You’ll hurt Rachel’s feelings.”

Then she turned to Rachel, all sweetness and fake concern.

“I didn’t mean to upset you. I just heard from one of the housekeepers that Aaron’s clothes were still in your closet, and I figured… that’s not fair to you. You barely had space for your own things. So I thought I’d help and move his stuff to our room.”

There was a time when Aaron wouldn’t leave her alone.

Rachel never got a single love letter growing up—not one. And that was entirely Aaron’s doing.

At some point, he started leaving his clothes in her room. Then more. And more. Until one day, half her closet was his.

He always joked that it was practical—easier to get dressed in the mornings when she was the one picking his shirts and ties.

She’d memorized his entire wardrobe without even trying. She knew which suit went with which tie, which fabric he liked against his skin, which color made his eyes stand out.

It used to be second nature.

Now, as she ran up the stairs and shoved her door open, all she could feel was the sting—like someone had hit her on the face.

The room was a disaster zone.

Her clothes were scattered across the floor. Shoes tossed like trash. Makeup spilled, broken, ruined. It looked like someone had broken in and torn the place apart.

Rachel spun toward the hallway and shouted, “This is how you ‘grabbed a few clothes,’ Sierra?!”

Sierra flinched, her eyes instantly welling with tears. “I—I’m sorry, Rachel. I didn’t mean to… I just got a little careless…”

“Careless?” Rachel laughed, incredulous. “This isn’t careless. This is what a hurricane looks like!”

Aaron’s voice came from behind them, clipped and cold. “Rachel. Watch your tone.”

She turned, eyes narrowing. “So now I’m the one out of line? Again?”

“Sierra’s going to be your sister-in-law. Show her some respect.”

Rachel stared at him. “Respect? You should come see this for yourself.”

Aaron walked in.

He paused at the doorway—just for a second—as his eyes swept across the chaos.

Just one second.

Then he smiled, not at the mess, but at her. “Yeah… maybe let the housekeepers handle things from now on, hmm?”

“But I hate when strangers touch my stuff,” Sierra pouted, twirling a strand of hair. “Especially... my sleepwear.”

She lingered on the last word, eyes dropping shyly, her cheeks flushing.

Aaron gave a helpless little chuckle and nodded. “Alright, Alright. No strangers. I’ll do it myself, princess. You just lounge around and look pretty.”

Sierra giggled, sticking her tongue out playfully. “I’m totally useless, huh?”

“Yeah,” he said fondly. “But lucky for you, I’m completely okay with that.”

Rachel closed her eyes for a moment.

She had never hated a notice period this much in her life. If not for the stupid two-week handoff, she’d already be on a plane across the ocean—anywhere but here, watching this twisted circus unfold.

Then Aaron turned back to her, tone neutral. “Rachel. Just tell me how much stuff Sierra damaged. I’ll cover it.”

That made her laugh. Cold. Bitter.

So now he was throwing money at her?

Aaron. Paying her off.

Sierra leaned in, nudging Rachel with a conspiratorial grin. “Come on, pad the number a little. He’ll pay whatever you say. Trust me—I’ll make sure of it.”

Aaron gave Sierra a playful glare. “Wow. Already scheming with the enemy?”

“Excuse me,” Sierra gasped dramatically, then laughed. “I’m practically family now. Obviously, I’ve got Rachel’s back.”

Rachel gave a dry laugh.

Family. Scheming. Enemy?

Funny, how easily those words got thrown around.

She wasn’t the girl he used to protect. Not the one he used to follow across continents, just to be near.

She was just a foster wolf. An orphan. A charity case taken in by the Whitemoon Pack.

Nothing more.

Her phone rang. It was Edmund.

She steadied her voice and picked up. “Edmund?”

“Hey, Rachel. Remember that bird series you took a few years ago? One of the editors here asked to see it. You think you could send me the original film scans?”

“Sure,” she said. “Give me a second.”

She walked into her room, trying to focus, trying to push everything else out of her head.

Rachel still used film cameras for most of her personal work. She kept all her negatives in a locked drawer.

She reached for the key—but froze.

The entire cabinet was wet.

Before she could even process that, Sierra’s voice chimed from the doorway.

“Oops—Rachel, I’m really sorry. I spilled coffee earlier and it splashed onto your cabinet. I didn’t want it to stain, so I just… washed the whole thing with water. Hope that’s okay.”

Rachel’s heart dropped.

She didn’t say a word. Just unlocked the drawer.

The second she pulled it open, her stomach caved in.

Rows of negatives—years of work—were soaked.

Some were unraveling. Some had already lost their color. Others were knotted together like seaweed, floating in water turned a deep, dirty brown.

Three years.

Three years of her life—ruined. Gone.

All of it.

Everything was ruined.

Rachel stood frozen, shaking from head to toe, too furious to speak.

Aaron had shown up at some point. He stood at the doorway now, glancing at the open drawer, at the soaked, tangled mess inside. His tone was maddeningly casual.

“Figure out how much it’s worth,” he said. “I’ll pay for it—Sierra and I both will.”

That was it. Rachel snapped.

“Can she afford what she destroyed?” Her voice cracked. “Do you even understand what those negatives meant to me? Do you?”

Aaron frowned slightly. “What I understand is that they’re already ruined. Yelling won’t change that. Sierra was just trying to help organize my clothes. Spilling the coffee was an accident.”

“Oh, so it’s fine because it was accidental? Someone crashes their car and kills a person—do they just get to say ‘oops, my bad’ and walk away?”

“Rachel.” His voice went cold. “Don’t be ridiculous. Film rolls aren’t a life. You can take new photos. It’s not the end of the world.”

From her phone, Edmund’s voice came through, concerned. “Rachel? Is everything okay? Something happen at home?”

Rachel inhaled deeply and forced herself to steady her voice. “Edmund… the negatives might be… unrecoverable. I’ll try to reshoot the set and send you something new soon.”

“That’s alright. No pressure. It’ll take at least two weeks to get the visa processed anyway.”

“Got it.”

That’s when Aaron’s head snapped up. “Visa? Are you leaving the country?”

Rachel ended the call.

She didn’t answer him right away. Just lowered her phone, took a breath, and bent down to gather the mess on the floor.

“Edmund can’t travel much anymore. His visa expired, and he asked me to help him sort it out.”

Aaron narrowed his eyes. “Doesn’t his daughter still live here? Why isn’t she helping?”

Rachel didn’t even look at him. “Feel free to call her and ask.”

“I’m not that bored.”

“Then maybe don’t ask so many questions.”

Rachel spent the entire night cleaning her room.

Everything Sierra had touched—clothes, shoes, shelves—felt tainted. She didn’t even bother trying to save it all. The ruined things went into a pile in the back of her closet.

She managed to salvage a few of the negatives, but the damage had been done. The images were warped beyond recognition. Useless.

Her makeup was no better. The liquid ones had spilled out. The powders were soaked. Everything was destroyed.

Then came a text.

Sierra: [Just a warning.]

Two minutes later, the message disappeared.

Deleted.

It was calculated—just long enough for Rachel to see, but not long enough to leave proof.

Too bad Sierra was playing with the wrong girl.

Rachel had already taken a screenshot the moment the notification popped up.

She sent it right back, along with a single reply: [Nothing much. Just returning the favor.]

Sierra didn’t respond.

For once, she had no snarky comeback, no follow-up emoji pretending it was all a joke.

Ten minutes passed.

Then finally—

I recently moved to a new area and, suddenly, don’t know how to make friends as an adult. If you’re interested in a mildly (?) amusing faceless acquaintance across the sea or just a state over, please read on :)

I’ll try to keep this genuine just so we both know what we’re in for. I’m an introverted young adult with fluctuating social skills living in north america. I moved away from the only place I’ve ever lived and also abandoned the only religion I’ve ever known just recently, so there are a lot of things I’m exploring right now! I’d say I’m prime for indoctrination, but I’ve already been through that, and it’s safe to say it’s not for me XD

If you were to ask me to describe myself, I’d have nothing immodest to say, but if you asked me what my friends would say about me, it would be that I’m overly kind, overly sensitive, overly shy and occasionally passionate. I’m most known for being a people pleaser, but hey, I’m growing out of that if that’s okay… 

Cats fascinate me. I have two little creatures that keep me company when they feel like it. I love nature, and where I’m living right now has so many beautiful places for me to hike. Maybe more like a somewhat inclined walk… I’m not a coffee person, but I love tea - send what kinds are your favorite :D I’m a dental assistant by day, writer by night. By writer, I mean opening my draft that I haven’t touched in a week to scroll through it and then get distracted. I’m not a huge fan of sweets, but I like to bake anyway. I’m proudly not a picky eater, so please share your culinary culture with me ^_^

Speaking of culture, I love history! I love experiencing different perspectives from new places that I would’ve never known otherwise. I’m currently thinking about learning a new language since I failed my last two attempts, but only thinking about it. What can I say, I’m a typical American :,) 

And, since we’re on the topic of America, I should disclose that I’m a leftist, but not a liberal. So, friends who are interested in having political conversations are absolutely welcome, specifically if you’re discussing socialism.

I love reading. As a child, I’d stay up late reading without regrets, took a high school hiatus to hate reading, and as an adult, I’m back to staying up late reading, just with some regrets as I look at the time :x my favorite book from my childhood is The Tale of Desperaux, and my current favorite read is No Longer Human. I’m also getting into manga, I’ve been working through Tokyo Ghoul for a bit now. I have a long TBR list between a few different genres, but I’m always open to adding onto it :D so please send me book, anime or manga recommendations ! 

Honestly, there’s not much that I don’t find interesting. If you’re older than me, younger than me, across the world, sharing in my cultural experience, have kids, don’t even want to think about having kids, a teacher or unemployed - I would like to hear from you. I’ve realized that I’m incredibly sheltered and know nothing about the world. But I’d like to change that, and hopefully make some friendships, whether they’re for a season or for a much longer time. The point of this for me, really, is to share in different life experiences and perspectives with people who I might have nothing or everything in common with. I can be awkward and weird, I try to be funny but fail often, I only speak this formally when I’m trying to be interesting and fail often at that too… but what I’m trying to sum up is that I’m very, very human. I think that’s the best way to describe me.

And this took me way too long to type out because I think I have a firm grasp on who I am until I am burdened with the task of explaining her. So, I guess there’s a lot about me for both of us to find out. If you read this far, thank you. I look forward to hearing from you :3

Oh and yes, I like piña coladas

He was the Alpha I’d loved all my life—the one I thought would mark me, marry me, make me his Luna.
Instead, he held another she-wolf in his arms and called her his future.
Then he looked at me, the girl he destroyed, and sneered, “How much do you want? I’ll pay. One billion?”
I smiled through the ache. “One dollar. That’s all I ask.”
And with that, I walked away—forever.
He thought I was cheap.
But he just lost everything.
“I’ve made up my mind, Edmund. I’m leaving the pack. I’m moving to Europe.”

On the other end of the line, Edmund—Rachel’s longtime mentor and a rogue elder—chuckled warmly. “Took you long enough! With your talent, you should’ve crossed the sea years ago. You’d be an internationally renowned lens-witch by now.”

Rachel offered a strained smile. “That’s kind of you to say. Thank you, Edmund.”

“So, when can I expect you here? I’ve met a few fashion magazine editors in Milan recently—they’ve seen your portfolio and are dying to meet the wolf behind the lens.”

She paused. “Give me two weeks. There are still things I need to settle within the territory.”

“Fair enough,” he said. “Your brother’s always been overly protective. I can’t imagine Alpha Aaron will be thrilled about his sister leaving pack lands alone. You’d better sit him down and say it with bite.”

After hanging up, Rachel’s gaze drifted to the pair across the boutique.

A woman was twirling in front of the mirror, wrapped in lace and silk—yet somehow, it was her scent that made Rachel’s stomach twist. The woman glowed, laughing, radiant in the giddy haze of a future Luna. And beside her stood a man—tall, commanding, his dark gaze soft as he watched her.

Aaron.

Rachel let out a bitter breath of laughter.

He had always been that way with her, once. Always present. Always near.

Even Luna Emily, their mother and the revered matriarch of their bloodline, used to tease, “What kind of Alpha clings to his sister’s scent like that? Wolves are going to start thinking you’re bonded.”

Aaron had just raised an eyebrow, his voice mild, but his eyes—gods, his eyes—had never wavered from Rachel. “Let them think what they want.”

She’d been stunned, back then. Flushed. Her heart had howled with something it couldn’t name. And when she looked up and met his gaze—steady, unwavering, impossibly tender—something inside her cracked open like a howl against the moon.

Wolves lived for fleeting moments like that.

And that moment became the sweetest—and cruelest—memory of Rachel’s life.

She waited for him to cross the line. Just one step. Just one growled word to claim her.

If he had, she would have said yes.

But that moment never came.

Instead, he turned his eyes—and his scent—toward someone else.

Sierra. His beta. A female beta.

She still remembered the day he handed her that stack of files.

“Rachel, help me pick one.”

She’d blinked. “Didn’t you already have a beta?”

“I need a female beta,” he said evenly. “Someone who can look after you. Adam’s great, but... he’s a male. It wouldn’t be proper.”

Something about it felt off. Her instincts twitched beneath her skin.

“I don’t really know how to choose a beta,” she said. “Ask Adam. He knows the ranks better than I do.”

But Aaron was firm. “You’ll be seeing her a lot. Might as well choose someone whose energy suits yours.”

So she chose Sierra.

She thought she was choosing a guard. A protector.

She didn’t realize she was choosing Aaron’s future mate.

“Rachel!”

Sierra’s voice carried across the boutique—light, sweet, and laced with triumph.

“Come help me decide! What do you think of this one? Your brother’s useless—he says they all look good. So not helpful.”

Rachel managed a breath. “It’s your mating gown. If you like it, that’s what matters.”

Sierra pouted. “You know I didn’t grow up surrounded by designer silks or Luna elegance. I just don’t want to wear something that makes Aaron look bad. But you—you have the Luna’s eye. You literally make beauty happen for a living.”

“I know how to frame a shot,” Rachel said stiffly. “Not a Luna ceremony.”

Sierra’s expression faltered, just for a beat. “Rachel… you still haven’t accepted me, have you?”

Rachel opened her mouth—but no words came out.

It wasn’t about Sierra.

It was about the man who used to hold Rachel like she was the only scent in the world worth chasing… now standing at another’s side.

“Aaron,” Sierra said softly, her tone carefully measured, “go check on Rachel. I think she’s still hurt about what happened last time.”

“She’s not,” Aaron replied, voice cool.

“It was my fault,” Sierra insisted. “I misread the moment. Maybe we should postpone the mating ceremony. Just until she’s ready to bless our union.”

Aaron frowned. “We can’t postpone a Luna binding because Rachel’s upset.”

“But she’s your blood. Her blessing… it matters to me.”

Aaron was silent. Then he turned, expression unreadable, and walked toward Rachel.

His voice, when it came, was colder than frost. “Still sulking over last time?”

Rachel turned away. “I’m not.”

“You threw your arms around me in front of Sierra. She misunderstood—and who wouldn’t? What kind of grown she-wolf launches herself at her Alpha like that? You should know better.”

The quiet sting of disapproval was worse than a claw to the chest.

Once upon a time, Aaron had clung to her scent like it was his anchor. If she took even a step away, he’d pull her back to his side. No one questioned it—not even Rachel.

When she trekked north to photograph snow-capped mountains, he followed.

When she flew to the savannahs of Africa for a wolf-conservation project, he was right there, walking the perimeter at night, guarding her tent.

He used to say, “Wherever you go, I’ll always be behind you. Just turn around.”

That day, her photo series won gold. Overwhelmed, she’d embraced him—because how could she not? He was her pack, her spine, her shadow.

And Sierra had walked in.

Since that moment, Aaron had changed.

Distant. Guarded. Cold.

Rachel drew a shaky breath. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make things awkward. If it upset her, I’ll be more careful next time.”

Aaron nodded once. “Good. As long as you understand.”

“I do,” she whispered. “You two keep looking at gowns. I’m not feeling well—I’ll head out.”

She turned on her heel and left the boutique.

Tears blurred her vision.

She wiped them away, furious with herself. With her weakness. With her wolf’s stupid ache.

Then she pulled out her phone.

And booked a plane ticket.

Two weeks from now, she’d be gone.

Gone from this pack.

Gone from her brother.

Gone from the only man she ever dared to love.

Rachel didn’t get back to home until nearly dawn.

Deciding to leave had only taken a second. But walking away from over twenty years of memories? That wasn’t something she could just flip off like a switch.

She wasn’t that strong—not yet.

Which is why, in the two weeks before her flight, she planned to avoid Aaron as much as possible. Just to make sure she wouldn’t change her mind.

When she stepped into the house, the place was pitch black.

She didn’t bother turning on the lights. Her body ached with exhaustion as she quietly made her way toward the stairs.

But before she could reach her room, a voice stopped her from the living room.

“Rachel.”

She turned and spotted a figure lounging on the couch.

Sierra.

“Need something?” Rachel asked flatly.

Sierra was draped across the arm of the sofa in a black lace camisole, her posture deliberately relaxed, seductive even. Her lips curled into a soft smile. “Aaron picked this one out for me. Do you like it?”

As she slowly sat up, the dim light caught the red marks scattered across her collarbone and waist—faint but unmistakable, made more striking against the sheer black fabric.

She touched one of the marks on her neck and let out a syrupy little wince. “Ow… your brother has terrible taste in wedding gowns, but he sure knows how to pick out lingerie. He said seeing me in this nearly drove him insane.”

Rachel stood at the foot of the stairs, unmoving. Her eyes narrowed. She looked down at Sierra with cool detachment, then gave her a cold, amused smile.

“Sierra,” she said dryly, “dial it back. You’re starting to reek.”

Sierra blinked innocently. “Reek of what?”

Rachel tilted her head. “Desperation. And something else. Starts with an S.”

Sierra let out a delighted little laugh. “S1utty, you mean? Can’t help it—your brother loves it when I’m like this. The second he got home, he all but begged me to change into this. And then…”

“I don’t need the play-by-play,” Rachel jumped in. “Spare me.”

“Whether you want to hear it or not, it’s still the truth,” Sierra said, voice coated in sugar. “He’s obsessed with my body, Rachel. Whatever history you two have? Doesn't matter. At the end of the day, men always choose what turns them on.”

Rachel turned to leave. “You’ve had your moment. I’m not sticking around for the encore.”

But Sierra wasn’t done. She jumped up, lifting the hem of her lace slip as she followed after her. “Oh come on, don’t walk away yet. You didn’t get a good look, did you? The marks he left? They’re all over—”

She reached for Rachel’s arm.

Rachel yanked away instinctively, nausea crawling up her throat. “Don’t touch me.”

At that exact moment, Aaron stepped out of the bedroom, a glass of milk still in hand.

His brows lifted. “What’s going on out here?”

Rachel opened her mouth to speak—but Sierra was faster.

She spun toward him, flashing Rachel one last look.

A smirk.

And then—scream.

Rachel barely processed it before Sierra stumbled backward and fell straight down the stairs.

“Sierra!” Aaron dropped the glass and rushed over, catching her just as she hit the last step.

He pulled her into his arms, cradling her like something fragile.

“Are you okay?”

Sierra looked up at him, breath shaky, lips trembling. “I’m fine. Just… don’t blame Rachel. It wasn’t on purpose.”

Aaron’s head snapped toward Rachel, eyes blazing with something between disbelief and anger.

“Rachel. I don’t care how much you hate her—pushing someone down the stairs? Are you out of your mind? Do you have any idea how dangerous that was?!”

His voice softened the second he looked back at Sierra, his expression laced with worry.

“Let’s get you back to the room,” he murmured. “I need to check you for injuries.”

Sierra flushed and buried her face against his chest. “Maybe we shouldn’t be so affectionate in front of Rachel from now on. It’s only natural for a sister to feel possessive… You were hers for so long, and now there’s me. I can’t imagine how hard that must be for her.”

Aaron’s jaw tightened. “She’ll have to get used to it.”

He stood, lifting Sierra easily into his arms.

As he carried her back to their room, Sierra peeked over his shoulder—and flashed Rachel a smug little V for victory.

Rachel stood frozen in place, her chest hollow.

This house didn’t feel like home anymore.

It felt like a place where she no longer belonged.

Sierra hadn’t just taken Aaron.

She’d torn her world apart and danced on the ruins.

Rachel couldn’t understand it.

How could Aaron fall for someone like her? Did Sierra hit the point?

Was it really just about lust? About who made his blood boil?

Rachel didn’t know. And at this point, she didn’t want to.

The next morning, Rachel headed to the magazine office.

She’d worked here for three years as a featured photographer, and over time, the place had become a second home. The people, her teammates—they were more than just coworkers.

When Gwen, the editor-in-chief, received her resignation letter, she looked genuinely caught off guard. “Is this about your salary? Because if that’s the issue, just say the word—I’ll talk to the executive director myself.”

Rachel shook her head with a faint smile. “Thanks, Gwen. It’s not about the money.”

“Then what is it?”

“I’ve just… got other plans. A different direction I need to follow.”

Gwen paused, and then her lips curled into a knowing grin. “Ah. You’re finally marrying Aaron and stepping into your Luna era, huh? Well, I can’t say I’m surprised. Alpha’s been picking you up from work every day, rain or shine. You’ve always been the center of his world. If anyone deserves to be his Luna, it’s you. I won’t try to talk you out of it.”

Rachel froze for a moment.

She’d intended to clarify. Aaron was holding a mating ceremony soon—just not with her.

But the moment Gwen finished talking, the urge to explain simply vanished.

What was the point?

There was no neat way to untangle the mess between her, Aaron, and Sierra. No quick summary that wouldn’t make her look foolish—or worse, pathetic.

Right now, she just wanted to tie up loose ends and disappear. Quietly. Cleanly. Two weeks, and she’d be gone.

“Oh! One more thing,” Gwen added, cheerful as ever. “What date’s the ceremony? Make sure I get an invite—I want to raise a glass to my favorite couple!”

Rachel gave a polite, awkward smile and said nothing.

Luckily, at that moment, the front desk receptionist, Meg, poked her head through the door, beaming.

“Rachel! Your mate’s here again—and he brought a surprise!”

Rachel stepped outside the office building and immediately spotted Aaron leaning against his black Cullinan, head tilted down like he was deep in thought.

She walked closer, and then she saw it.

The “surprise” Meg had mentioned.

The entire backseat and trunk of his SUV—every inch of it—was overflowing with roses. Bright crimson. Dozens, maybe hundreds, so tightly packed that the scent practically spilled into the street.

Only the passenger seat had been left empty.

Behind her, she heard whispers and stifled giggles. A few of her coworkers were pressed up against the lobby windows, half-hiding behind the blinds as they peeked out at the scene, nudging each other like giddy teenagers.

Aaron had done things like this before.

Sometimes he brought her cupcakes. Sometimes a favorite latte or random snacks she liked. The little gestures had become routine over the years.

Her coworkers had come to expect it—and more than once, they’d tease her with mock envy.

“Rachel’s Alpha strikes again,” they’d whisper.

“It’s like Uber Eats, but free.”

Rachel had never denied it. She’d laugh along and share whatever he brought, letting them believe what they wanted.

But today was different.

She could already imagine them waiting to split the flowers—fighting over who got to take home the prettiest bouquet.

She stepped forward. “Aaron.”

He looked up, but his face was unreadable—cold, even. His tone matched it.

“Don’t call me that anymore. Use ‘Alpha.’”

Rachel blinked, caught off guard. Then, after a pause, she nodded slowly. “Got it. Alpha.”

Aaron’s expression softened just slightly. “About last night… I was too harsh. Don’t take it personally.”

“Sure,” she said.

Aaron pressed, “But seriously, Rachel—what were you thinking? Someone could’ve gotten really hurt.”

Rachel’s head snapped up, eyes widened with disbelief—then she let out a short, breathy laugh, one that held no humor at all.

“So this is why you came? To judge me?”

Aaron’s jaw tightened. “You still don’t think you were out of line?”

She stared at him. Disbelief turning into anger, sharp and sudden. “You’ve known me for over twenty years. And you really think I’d push her—in our own house—like I’m that stupid?”

Rachel snapped.

The words came out sharper than she meant, fueled by frustration she could barely contain.

And the moment they did, regret settled in.

What was the point?

She was leaving. Nothing she said now would change anything.

She exhaled slowly. “Forget it. Just go. I’ve got work to do.”

As she headed back toward the office doors, the laughter and teasing from moments earlier had died down. Her coworkers, who’d just been giggling behind the glass, were suddenly quiet. Their expressions had shifted—curious, concerned.

“Rachel, everything okay? Did you guys get into a fight?”

“Yeah, don’t be mad,” one of them said. “A car full of roses? The man’s basically waving a white flag. Just... hear him out?”

Rachel kept her face unreadable and murmured, “You all should get back to work.”

Her voice wasn’t harsh, but it was firm.

And they listened.

Rachel wasn’t just some coworker. She was the photographer around here—sharp, professional, respected. The younger girls admired her. Respected her.

So, with a few awkward glances and murmured “sorry”s, the group quietly slipped back inside.

All except Meg.

Meg, who’d been closest to Rachel since the day she joined, tugged at her sleeve and whispered, “Hey… can I grab one of those roses? I saw the whole trunk full. I even brought vases.”

Rachel sighed. “I’ll buy you some. I’m not letting your vase sit empty, promise.”

Back at her desk, her focus was shot.

She forced herself to edit a few photos from last week’s shoot, but her mind wasn’t in it.

Then her phone buzzed—messages form Sierra.

Sierra: [Which one do you like best?]

Three photos. Three different sets of lingerie—or rather, barely there sleepwear. Lacy, sheer, suggestive.

More skin than fabric. And none of it subtle.

Seconds later, the messages disappeared.

Sierra: [Oops, sorry! Wrong person]

Rachel stared at the screen.

Turned it off.

Tossed it into her drawer and slammed it shut.

They both knew well it wasn’t a mistake.

Sierra had meant for her to see it.

The hours dragged by. She didn’t check her phone again until the office lights started dimming and people began leaving for the night.

She turned it back on.

No missed calls.

No texts.

Nothing.

Not long ago, if she didn’t reply to Aaron within thirty minutes, he’d call, text, or show up in person. No matter what time it was.

Now? Radio silence.

Her social feed had a few notifications.

She opened it—and the first post that popped up stopped her cold.

A photo.

Aaron’s Cullinan, same black SUV as always, trunk still overflowing with roses. And Sierra, standing in front of it, cradling a bouquet, beaming like she owned the world.

The caption read: “Thanks, my babe. Best birthday gift ever.”

So today was Sierra’s birthday.

Those flowers weren’t meant for Rachel.

Not the roses. Not the passenger seat. Not anymore.

After work, Rachel didn’t want to go back to the packhouse.

But then Luna Emily called.

“Sweetheart,” the Luna said warmly, “you’ve been working so late lately. I worry about you out there alone. I’ll send Aaron to come pick you up, okay?”

“No, it’s fine,” Rachel replied quickly. “I’ll just take a cab home.”

There was no way she was getting into that SUV again.

Not when the seat beside him and the backseat full of flowers belonged to someone else.

Emily hesitated, then softened. “Alright, just… be careful, okay?”

“Always.”

When Rachel arrived home, both Aaron and Sierra were already there.

Sierra stood in the hallway with a giant suitcase, just stepping out of Rachel’s room.

“Hey, you’re back!” she chirped.

Rachel’s heart slammed into her ribs.

“You went in my room?”

Sierra blinked in surprise, but before she could answer, Aaron’s voice cut through the space like a blade.

“I told her to.”

He walked out from the kitchen, setting his glass down a little too hard on the table.

Rachel turned toward him, stunned. “You had no right.”

“She’s going to be Luna,” Aaron said calmly. “That means she has access to any room she wants.”

And just like that, Rachel felt like someone had poured a bucket of ice water down her spine.

Sierra stepped closer, voice all honey and softness. “Aaron, don’t say it like that. You’ll hurt Rachel’s feelings.”

Then she turned to Rachel, all sweetness and fake concern.

“I didn’t mean to upset you. I just heard from one of the housekeepers that Aaron’s clothes were still in your closet, and I figured… that’s not fair to you. You barely had space for your own things. So I thought I’d help and move his stuff to our room.”

There was a time when Aaron wouldn’t leave her alone.

Rachel never got a single love letter growing up—not one. And that was entirely Aaron’s doing.

At some point, he started leaving his clothes in her room. Then more. And more. Until one day, half her closet was his.

He always joked that it was practical—easier to get dressed in the mornings when she was the one picking his shirts and ties.

She’d memorized his entire wardrobe without even trying. She knew which suit went with which tie, which fabric he liked against his skin, which color made his eyes stand out.

It used to be second nature.

Now, as she ran up the stairs and shoved her door open, all she could feel was the sting—like someone had hit her on the face.

The room was a disaster zone.

Her clothes were scattered across the floor. Shoes tossed like trash. Makeup spilled, broken, ruined. It looked like someone had broken in and torn the place apart.

Rachel spun toward the hallway and shouted, “This is how you ‘grabbed a few clothes,’ Sierra?!”

Sierra flinched, her eyes instantly welling with tears. “I—I’m sorry, Rachel. I didn’t mean to… I just got a little careless…”

“Careless?” Rachel laughed, incredulous. “This isn’t careless. This is what a hurricane looks like!”

Aaron’s voice came from behind them, clipped and cold. “Rachel. Watch your tone.”

She turned, eyes narrowing. “So now I’m the one out of line? Again?”

“Sierra’s going to be your sister-in-law. Show her some respect.”

Rachel stared at him. “Respect? You should come see this for yourself.”

Aaron walked in.

He paused at the doorway—just for a second—as his eyes swept across the chaos.

Just one second.

Then he smiled, not at the mess, but at her. “Yeah… maybe let the housekeepers handle things from now on, hmm?”

“But I hate when strangers touch my stuff,” Sierra pouted, twirling a strand of hair. “Especially... my sleepwear.”

She lingered on the last word, eyes dropping shyly, her cheeks flushing.

Aaron gave a helpless little chuckle and nodded. “Alright, Alright. No strangers. I’ll do it myself, princess. You just lounge around and look pretty.”

Sierra giggled, sticking her tongue out playfully. “I’m totally useless, huh?”

“Yeah,” he said fondly. “But lucky for you, I’m completely okay with that.”

Rachel closed her eyes for a moment.

She had never hated a notice period this much in her life. If not for the stupid two-week handoff, she’d already be on a plane across the ocean—anywhere but here, watching this twisted circus unfold.

Then Aaron turned back to her, tone neutral. “Rachel. Just tell me how much stuff Sierra damaged. I’ll cover it.”

That made her laugh. Cold. Bitter.

So now he was throwing money at her?

Aaron. Paying her off.

Sierra leaned in, nudging Rachel with a conspiratorial grin. “Come on, pad the number a little. He’ll pay whatever you say. Trust me—I’ll make sure of it.”

Aaron gave Sierra a playful glare. “Wow. Already scheming with the enemy?”

“Excuse me,” Sierra gasped dramatically, then laughed. “I’m practically family now. Obviously, I’ve got Rachel’s back.”

Rachel gave a dry laugh.

Family. Scheming. Enemy?

Funny, how easily those words got thrown around.

She wasn’t the girl he used to protect. Not the one he used to follow across continents, just to be near.

She was just a foster wolf. An orphan. A charity case taken in by the Whitemoon Pack.

Nothing more.

Her phone rang. It was Edmund.

She steadied her voice and picked up. “Edmund?”

“Hey, Rachel. Remember that bird series you took a few years ago? One of the editors here asked to see it. You think you could send me the original film scans?”

“Sure,” she said. “Give me a second.”

She walked into her room, trying to focus, trying to push everything else out of her head.

Rachel still used film cameras for most of her personal work. She kept all her negatives in a locked drawer.

She reached for the key—but froze.

The entire cabinet was wet.

Before she could even process that, Sierra’s voice chimed from the doorway.

“Oops—Rachel, I’m really sorry. I spilled coffee earlier and it splashed onto your cabinet. I didn’t want it to stain, so I just… washed the whole thing with water. Hope that’s okay.”

Rachel’s heart dropped.

She didn’t say a word. Just unlocked the drawer.

The second she pulled it open, her stomach caved in.

Rows of negatives—years of work—were soaked.

Some were unraveling. Some had already lost their color. Others were knotted together like seaweed, floating in water turned a deep, dirty brown.

Three years.

Three years of her life—ruined. Gone.

All of it.

Everything was ruined.

Rachel stood frozen, shaking from head to toe, too furious to speak.

Aaron had shown up at some point. He stood at the doorway now, glancing at the open drawer, at the soaked, tangled mess inside. His tone was maddeningly casual.

“Figure out how much it’s worth,” he said. “I’ll pay for it—Sierra and I both will.”

That was it. Rachel snapped.

“Can she afford what she destroyed?” Her voice cracked. “Do you even understand what those negatives meant to me? Do you?”

Aaron frowned slightly. “What I understand is that they’re already ruined. Yelling won’t change that. Sierra was just trying to help organize my clothes. Spilling the coffee was an accident.”

“Oh, so it’s fine because it was accidental? Someone crashes their car and kills a person—do they just get to say ‘oops, my bad’ and walk away?”

“Rachel.” His voice went cold. “Don’t be ridiculous. Film rolls aren’t a life. You can take new photos. It’s not the end of the world.”

From her phone, Edmund’s voice came through, concerned. “Rachel? Is everything okay? Something happen at home?”

Rachel inhaled deeply and forced herself to steady her voice. “Edmund… the negatives might be… unrecoverable. I’ll try to reshoot the set and send you something new soon.”

“That’s alright. No pressure. It’ll take at least two weeks to get the visa processed anyway.”

“Got it.”

That’s when Aaron’s head snapped up. “Visa? Are you leaving the country?”

Rachel ended the call.

She didn’t answer him right away. Just lowered her phone, took a breath, and bent down to gather the mess on the floor.

“Edmund can’t travel much anymore. His visa expired, and he asked me to help him sort it out.”

Aaron narrowed his eyes. “Doesn’t his daughter still live here? Why isn’t she helping?”

Rachel didn’t even look at him. “Feel free to call her and ask.”

“I’m not that bored.”

“Then maybe don’t ask so many questions.”

Rachel spent the entire night cleaning her room.

Everything Sierra had touched—clothes, shoes, shelves—felt tainted. She didn’t even bother trying to save it all. The ruined things went into a pile in the back of her closet.

She managed to salvage a few of the negatives, but the damage had been done. The images were warped beyond recognition. Useless.

Her makeup was no better. The liquid ones had spilled out. The powders were soaked. Everything was destroyed.

Then came a text.

Sierra: [Just a warning.]

Two minutes later, the message disappeared.

Deleted.

It was calculated—just long enough for Rachel to see, but not long enough to leave proof.

Too bad Sierra was playing with the wrong girl.

Rachel had already taken a screenshot the moment the notification popped up.

She sent it right back, along with a single reply: [Nothing much. Just returning the favor.]

Sierra didn’t respond.

For once, she had no snarky comeback, no follow-up emoji pretending it was all a joke.

Ten minutes passed.

Then finally—

1m73aly,https://i.redd.it/iwrzb9znykef1.jpeg,looking for this novel,"He was the Alpha I’d loved all my life—the one I thought would mark me, marry me, make me his Luna.
Instead, he held another she-wolf in his arms and called her his future.
Then he looked at me, the girl he destroyed, and sneered, “How much do you want? I’ll pay. One billion?”
I smiled through the ache. “One dollar. That’s all I ask.”
And with that, I walked away—forever.
He thought I was cheap.
But he just lost everything.
“I’ve made up my mind, Edmund. I’m leaving the pack. I’m moving to Europe.”

On the other end of the line, Edmund—Rachel’s longtime mentor and a rogue elder—chuckled warmly. “Took you long enough! With your talent, you should’ve crossed the sea years ago. You’d be an internationally renowned lens-witch by now.”

Rachel offered a strained smile. “That’s kind of you to say. Thank you, Edmund.”

“So, when can I expect you here? I’ve met a few fashion magazine editors in Milan recently—they’ve seen your portfolio and are dying to meet the wolf behind the lens.”

She paused. “Give me two weeks. There are still things I need to settle within the territory.”

“Fair enough,” he said. “Your brother’s always been overly protective. I can’t imagine Alpha Aaron will be thrilled about his sister leaving pack lands alone. You’d better sit him down and say it with bite.”

After hanging up, Rachel’s gaze drifted to the pair across the boutique.

A woman was twirling in front of the mirror, wrapped in lace and silk—yet somehow, it was her scent that made Rachel’s stomach twist. The woman glowed, laughing, radiant in the giddy haze of a future Luna. And beside her stood a man—tall, commanding, his dark gaze soft as he watched her.

Aaron.

Rachel let out a bitter breath of laughter.

He had always been that way with her, once. Always present. Always near.

Even Luna Emily, their mother and the revered matriarch of their bloodline, used to tease, “What kind of Alpha clings to his sister’s scent like that? Wolves are going to start thinking you’re bonded.”

Aaron had just raised an eyebrow, his voice mild, but his eyes—gods, his eyes—had never wavered from Rachel. “Let them think what they want.”

She’d been stunned, back then. Flushed. Her heart had howled with something it couldn’t name. And when she looked up and met his gaze—steady, unwavering, impossibly tender—something inside her cracked open like a howl against the moon.

Wolves lived for fleeting moments like that.

And that moment became the sweetest—and cruelest—memory of Rachel’s life.

She waited for him to cross the line. Just one step. Just one growled word to claim her.

If he had, she would have said yes.

But that moment never came.

Instead, he turned his eyes—and his scent—toward someone else.

Sierra. His beta. A female beta.

She still remembered the day he handed her that stack of files.

“Rachel, help me pick one.”

She’d blinked. “Didn’t you already have a beta?”

“I need a female beta,” he said evenly. “Someone who can look after you. Adam’s great, but... he’s a male. It wouldn’t be proper.”

Something about it felt off. Her instincts twitched beneath her skin.

“I don’t really know how to choose a beta,” she said. “Ask Adam. He knows the ranks better than I do.”

But Aaron was firm. “You’ll be seeing her a lot. Might as well choose someone whose energy suits yours.”

So she chose Sierra.

She thought she was choosing a guard. A protector.

She didn’t realize she was choosing Aaron’s future mate.

“Rachel!”

Sierra’s voice carried across the boutique—light, sweet, and laced with triumph.

“Come help me decide! What do you think of this one? Your brother’s useless—he says they all look good. So not helpful.”

Rachel managed a breath. “It’s your mating gown. If you like it, that’s what matters.”

Sierra pouted. “You know I didn’t grow up surrounded by designer silks or Luna elegance. I just don’t want to wear something that makes Aaron look bad. But you—you have the Luna’s eye. You literally make beauty happen for a living.”

“I know how to frame a shot,” Rachel said stiffly. “Not a Luna ceremony.”

Sierra’s expression faltered, just for a beat. “Rachel… you still haven’t accepted me, have you?”

Rachel opened her mouth—but no words came out.

It wasn’t about Sierra.

It was about the man who used to hold Rachel like she was the only scent in the world worth chasing… now standing at another’s side.

“Aaron,” Sierra said softly, her tone carefully measured, “go check on Rachel. I think she’s still hurt about what happened last time.”

“She’s not,” Aaron replied, voice cool.

“It was my fault,” Sierra insisted. “I misread the moment. Maybe we should postpone the mating ceremony. Just until she’s ready to bless our union.”

Aaron frowned. “We can’t postpone a Luna binding because Rachel’s upset.”

“But she’s your blood. Her blessing… it matters to me.”

Aaron was silent. Then he turned, expression unreadable, and walked toward Rachel.

His voice, when it came, was colder than frost. “Still sulking over last time?”

Rachel turned away. “I’m not.”

“You threw your arms around me in front of Sierra. She misunderstood—and who wouldn’t? What kind of grown she-wolf launches herself at her Alpha like that? You should know better.”

The quiet sting of disapproval was worse than a claw to the chest.

Once upon a time, Aaron had clung to her scent like it was his anchor. If she took even a step away, he’d pull her back to his side. No one questioned it—not even Rachel.

When she trekked north to photograph snow-capped mountains, he followed.

When she flew to the savannahs of Africa for a wolf-conservation project, he was right there, walking the perimeter at night, guarding her tent.

He used to say, “Wherever you go, I’ll always be behind you. Just turn around.”

That day, her photo series won gold. Overwhelmed, she’d embraced him—because how could she not? He was her pack, her spine, her shadow.

And Sierra had walked in.

Since that moment, Aaron had changed.

Distant. Guarded. Cold.

Rachel drew a shaky breath. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make things awkward. If it upset her, I’ll be more careful next time.”

Aaron nodded once. “Good. As long as you understand.”

“I do,” she whispered. “You two keep looking at gowns. I’m not feeling well—I’ll head out.”

She turned on her heel and left the boutique.

Tears blurred her vision.

She wiped them away, furious with herself. With her weakness. With her wolf’s stupid ache.

Then she pulled out her phone.

And booked a plane ticket.

Two weeks from now, she’d be gone.

Gone from this pack.

Gone from her brother.

Gone from the only man she ever dared to love.

Rachel didn’t get back to home until nearly dawn.

Deciding to leave had only taken a second. But walking away from over twenty years of memories? That wasn’t something she could just flip off like a switch.

She wasn’t that strong—not yet.

Which is why, in the two weeks before her flight, she planned to avoid Aaron as much as possible. Just to make sure she wouldn’t change her mind.

When she stepped into the house, the place was pitch black.

She didn’t bother turning on the lights. Her body ached with exhaustion as she quietly made her way toward the stairs.

But before she could reach her room, a voice stopped her from the living room.

“Rachel.”

She turned and spotted a figure lounging on the couch.

Sierra.

“Need something?” Rachel asked flatly.

Sierra was draped across the arm of the sofa in a black lace camisole, her posture deliberately relaxed, seductive even. Her lips curled into a soft smile. “Aaron picked this one out for me. Do you like it?”

As she slowly sat up, the dim light caught the red marks scattered across her collarbone and waist—faint but unmistakable, made more striking against the sheer black fabric.

She touched one of the marks on her neck and let out a syrupy little wince. “Ow… your brother has terrible taste in wedding gowns, but he sure knows how to pick out lingerie. He said seeing me in this nearly drove him insane.”

Rachel stood at the foot of the stairs, unmoving. Her eyes narrowed. She looked down at Sierra with cool detachment, then gave her a cold, amused smile.

“Sierra,” she said dryly, “dial it back. You’re starting to reek.”

Sierra blinked innocently. “Reek of what?”

Rachel tilted her head. “Desperation. And something else. Starts with an S.”

Sierra let out a delighted little laugh. “S1utty, you mean? Can’t help it—your brother loves it when I’m like this. The second he got home, he all but begged me to change into this. And then…”

“I don’t need the play-by-play,” Rachel jumped in. “Spare me.”

“Whether you want to hear it or not, it’s still the truth,” Sierra said, voice coated in sugar. “He’s obsessed with my body, Rachel. Whatever history you two have? Doesn't matter. At the end of the day, men always choose what turns them on.”

Rachel turned to leave. “You’ve had your moment. I’m not sticking around for the encore.”

But Sierra wasn’t done. She jumped up, lifting the hem of her lace slip as she followed after her. “Oh come on, don’t walk away yet. You didn’t get a good look, did you? The marks he left? They’re all over—”

She reached for Rachel’s arm.

Rachel yanked away instinctively, nausea crawling up her throat. “Don’t touch me.”

At that exact moment, Aaron stepped out of the bedroom, a glass of milk still in hand.

His brows lifted. “What’s going on out here?”

Rachel opened her mouth to speak—but Sierra was faster.

She spun toward him, flashing Rachel one last look.

A smirk.

And then—scream.

Rachel barely processed it before Sierra stumbled backward and fell straight down the stairs.

“Sierra!” Aaron dropped the glass and rushed over, catching her just as she hit the last step.

He pulled her into his arms, cradling her like something fragile.

“Are you okay?”

Sierra looked up at him, breath shaky, lips trembling. “I’m fine. Just… don’t blame Rachel. It wasn’t on purpose.”

Aaron’s head snapped toward Rachel, eyes blazing with something between disbelief and anger.

“Rachel. I don’t care how much you hate her—pushing someone down the stairs? Are you out of your mind? Do you have any idea how dangerous that was?!”

His voice softened the second he looked back at Sierra, his expression laced with worry.

“Let’s get you back to the room,” he murmured. “I need to check you for injuries.”

Sierra flushed and buried her face against his chest. “Maybe we shouldn’t be so affectionate in front of Rachel from now on. It’s only natural for a sister to feel possessive… You were hers for so long, and now there’s me. I can’t imagine how hard that must be for her.”

Aaron’s jaw tightened. “She’ll have to get used to it.”

He stood, lifting Sierra easily into his arms.

As he carried her back to their room, Sierra peeked over his shoulder—and flashed Rachel a smug little V for victory.

Rachel stood frozen in place, her chest hollow.

This house didn’t feel like home anymore.

It felt like a place where she no longer belonged.

Sierra hadn’t just taken Aaron.

She’d torn her world apart and danced on the ruins.

Rachel couldn’t understand it.

How could Aaron fall for someone like her? Did Sierra hit the point?

Was it really just about lust? About who made his blood boil?

Rachel didn’t know. And at this point, she didn’t want to.

The next morning, Rachel headed to the magazine office.

She’d worked here for three years as a featured photographer, and over time, the place had become a second home. The people, her teammates—they were more than just coworkers.

When Gwen, the editor-in-chief, received her resignation letter, she looked genuinely caught off guard. “Is this about your salary? Because if that’s the issue, just say the word—I’ll talk to the executive director myself.”

Rachel shook her head with a faint smile. “Thanks, Gwen. It’s not about the money.”

“Then what is it?”

“I’ve just… got other plans. A different direction I need to follow.”

Gwen paused, and then her lips curled into a knowing grin. “Ah. You’re finally marrying Aaron and stepping into your Luna era, huh? Well, I can’t say I’m surprised. Alpha’s been picking you up from work every day, rain or shine. You’ve always been the center of his world. If anyone deserves to be his Luna, it’s you. I won’t try to talk you out of it.”

Rachel froze for a moment.

She’d intended to clarify. Aaron was holding a mating ceremony soon—just not with her.

But the moment Gwen finished talking, the urge to explain simply vanished.

What was the point?

There was no neat way to untangle the mess between her, Aaron, and Sierra. No quick summary that wouldn’t make her look foolish—or worse, pathetic.

Right now, she just wanted to tie up loose ends and disappear. Quietly. Cleanly. Two weeks, and she’d be gone.

“Oh! One more thing,” Gwen added, cheerful as ever. “What date’s the ceremony? Make sure I get an invite—I want to raise a glass to my favorite couple!”

Rachel gave a polite, awkward smile and said nothing.

Luckily, at that moment, the front desk receptionist, Meg, poked her head through the door, beaming.

“Rachel! Your mate’s here again—and he brought a surprise!”

Rachel stepped outside the office building and immediately spotted Aaron leaning against his black Cullinan, head tilted down like he was deep in thought.

She walked closer, and then she saw it.

The “surprise” Meg had mentioned.

The entire backseat and trunk of his SUV—every inch of it—was overflowing with roses. Bright crimson. Dozens, maybe hundreds, so tightly packed that the scent practically spilled into the street.

Only the passenger seat had been left empty.

Behind her, she heard whispers and stifled giggles. A few of her coworkers were pressed up against the lobby windows, half-hiding behind the blinds as they peeked out at the scene, nudging each other like giddy teenagers.

Aaron had done things like this before.

Sometimes he brought her cupcakes. Sometimes a favorite latte or random snacks she liked. The little gestures had become routine over the years.

Her coworkers had come to expect it—and more than once, they’d tease her with mock envy.

“Rachel’s Alpha strikes again,” they’d whisper.

“It’s like Uber Eats, but free.”

Rachel had never denied it. She’d laugh along and share whatever he brought, letting them believe what they wanted.

But today was different.

She could already imagine them waiting to split the flowers—fighting over who got to take home the prettiest bouquet.

She stepped forward. “Aaron.”

He looked up, but his face was unreadable—cold, even. His tone matched it.

“Don’t call me that anymore. Use ‘Alpha.’”

Rachel blinked, caught off guard. Then, after a pause, she nodded slowly. “Got it. Alpha.”

Aaron’s expression softened just slightly. “About last night… I was too harsh. Don’t take it personally.”

“Sure,” she said.

Aaron pressed, “But seriously, Rachel—what were you thinking? Someone could’ve gotten really hurt.”

Rachel’s head snapped up, eyes widened with disbelief—then she let out a short, breathy laugh, one that held no humor at all.

“So this is why you came? To judge me?”

Aaron’s jaw tightened. “You still don’t think you were out of line?”

She stared at him. Disbelief turning into anger, sharp and sudden. “You’ve known me for over twenty years. And you really think I’d push her—in our own house—like I’m that stupid?”

Rachel snapped.

The words came out sharper than she meant, fueled by frustration she could barely contain.

And the moment they did, regret settled in.

What was the point?

She was leaving. Nothing she said now would change anything.

She exhaled slowly. “Forget it. Just go. I’ve got work to do.”

As she headed back toward the office doors, the laughter and teasing from moments earlier had died down. Her coworkers, who’d just been giggling behind the glass, were suddenly quiet. Their expressions had shifted—curious, concerned.

“Rachel, everything okay? Did you guys get into a fight?”

“Yeah, don’t be mad,” one of them said. “A car full of roses? The man’s basically waving a white flag. Just... hear him out?”

Rachel kept her face unreadable and murmured, “You all should get back to work.”

Her voice wasn’t harsh, but it was firm.

And they listened.

Rachel wasn’t just some coworker. She was the photographer around here—sharp, professional, respected. The younger girls admired her. Respected her.

So, with a few awkward glances and murmured “sorry”s, the group quietly slipped back inside.

All except Meg.

Meg, who’d been closest to Rachel since the day she joined, tugged at her sleeve and whispered, “Hey… can I grab one of those roses? I saw the whole trunk full. I even brought vases.”

Rachel sighed. “I’ll buy you some. I’m not letting your vase sit empty, promise.”

Back at her desk, her focus was shot.

She forced herself to edit a few photos from last week’s shoot, but her mind wasn’t in it.

Then her phone buzzed—messages form Sierra.

Sierra: [Which one do you like best?]

Three photos. Three different sets of lingerie—or rather, barely there sleepwear. Lacy, sheer, suggestive.

More skin than fabric. And none of it subtle.

Seconds later, the messages disappeared.

Sierra: [Oops, sorry! Wrong person]

Rachel stared at the screen.

Turned it off.

Tossed it into her drawer and slammed it shut.

They both knew well it wasn’t a mistake.

Sierra had meant for her to see it.

The hours dragged by. She didn’t check her phone again until the office lights started dimming and people began leaving for the night.

She turned it back on.

No missed calls.

No texts.

Nothing.

Not long ago, if she didn’t reply to Aaron within thirty minutes, he’d call, text, or show up in person. No matter what time it was.

Now? Radio silence.

Her social feed had a few notifications.

She opened it—and the first post that popped up stopped her cold.

A photo.

Aaron’s Cullinan, same black SUV as always, trunk still overflowing with roses. And Sierra, standing in front of it, cradling a bouquet, beaming like she owned the world.

The caption read: “Thanks, my babe. Best birthday gift ever.”

So today was Sierra’s birthday.

Those flowers weren’t meant for Rachel.

Not the roses. Not the passenger seat. Not anymore.

After work, Rachel didn’t want to go back to the packhouse.

But then Luna Emily called.

“Sweetheart,” the Luna said warmly, “you’ve been working so late lately. I worry about you out there alone. I’ll send Aaron to come pick you up, okay?”

“No, it’s fine,” Rachel replied quickly. “I’ll just take a cab home.”

There was no way she was getting into that SUV again.

Not when the seat beside him and the backseat full of flowers belonged to someone else.

Emily hesitated, then softened. “Alright, just… be careful, okay?”

“Always.”

When Rachel arrived home, both Aaron and Sierra were already there.

Sierra stood in the hallway with a giant suitcase, just stepping out of Rachel’s room.

“Hey, you’re back!” she chirped.

Rachel’s heart slammed into her ribs.

“You went in my room?”

Sierra blinked in surprise, but before she could answer, Aaron’s voice cut through the space like a blade.

“I told her to.”

He walked out from the kitchen, setting his glass down a little too hard on the table.

Rachel turned toward him, stunned. “You had no right.”

“She’s going to be Luna,” Aaron said calmly. “That means she has access to any room she wants.”

And just like that, Rachel felt like someone had poured a bucket of ice water down her spine.

Sierra stepped closer, voice all honey and softness. “Aaron, don’t say it like that. You’ll hurt Rachel’s feelings.”

Then she turned to Rachel, all sweetness and fake concern.

“I didn’t mean to upset you. I just heard from one of the housekeepers that Aaron’s clothes were still in your closet, and I figured… that’s not fair to you. You barely had space for your own things. So I thought I’d help and move his stuff to our room.”

There was a time when Aaron wouldn’t leave her alone.

Rachel never got a single love letter growing up—not one. And that was entirely Aaron’s doing.

At some point, he started leaving his clothes in her room. Then more. And more. Until one day, half her closet was his.

He always joked that it was practical—easier to get dressed in the mornings when she was the one picking his shirts and ties.

She’d memorized his entire wardrobe without even trying. She knew which suit went with which tie, which fabric he liked against his skin, which color made his eyes stand out.

It used to be second nature.

Now, as she ran up the stairs and shoved her door open, all she could feel was the sting—like someone had hit her on the face.

The room was a disaster zone.

Her clothes were scattered across the floor. Shoes tossed like trash. Makeup spilled, broken, ruined. It looked like someone had broken in and torn the place apart.

Rachel spun toward the hallway and shouted, “This is how you ‘grabbed a few clothes,’ Sierra?!”

Sierra flinched, her eyes instantly welling with tears. “I—I’m sorry, Rachel. I didn’t mean to… I just got a little careless…”

“Careless?” Rachel laughed, incredulous. “This isn’t careless. This is what a hurricane looks like!”

Aaron’s voice came from behind them, clipped and cold. “Rachel. Watch your tone.”

She turned, eyes narrowing. “So now I’m the one out of line? Again?”

“Sierra’s going to be your sister-in-law. Show her some respect.”

Rachel stared at him. “Respect? You should come see this for yourself.”

Aaron walked in.

He paused at the doorway—just for a second—as his eyes swept across the chaos.

Just one second.

Then he smiled, not at the mess, but at her. “Yeah… maybe let the housekeepers handle things from now on, hmm?”

“But I hate when strangers touch my stuff,” Sierra pouted, twirling a strand of hair. “Especially... my sleepwear.”

She lingered on the last word, eyes dropping shyly, her cheeks flushing.

Aaron gave a helpless little chuckle and nodded. “Alright, Alright. No strangers. I’ll do it myself, princess. You just lounge around and look pretty.”

Sierra giggled, sticking her tongue out playfully. “I’m totally useless, huh?”

“Yeah,” he said fondly. “But lucky for you, I’m completely okay with that.”

Rachel closed her eyes for a moment.

She had never hated a notice period this much in her life. If not for the stupid two-week handoff, she’d already be on a plane across the ocean—anywhere but here, watching this twisted circus unfold.

Then Aaron turned back to her, tone neutral. “Rachel. Just tell me how much stuff Sierra damaged. I’ll cover it.”

That made her laugh. Cold. Bitter.

So now he was throwing money at her?

Aaron. Paying her off.

Sierra leaned in, nudging Rachel with a conspiratorial grin. “Come on, pad the number a little. He’ll pay whatever you say. Trust me—I’ll make sure of it.”

Aaron gave Sierra a playful glare. “Wow. Already scheming with the enemy?”

“Excuse me,” Sierra gasped dramatically, then laughed. “I’m practically family now. Obviously, I’ve got Rachel’s back.”

Rachel gave a dry laugh.

Family. Scheming. Enemy?

Funny, how easily those words got thrown around.

She wasn’t the girl he used to protect. Not the one he used to follow across continents, just to be near.

She was just a foster wolf. An orphan. A charity case taken in by the Whitemoon Pack.

Nothing more.

Her phone rang. It was Edmund.

She steadied her voice and picked up. “Edmund?”

“Hey, Rachel. Remember that bird series you took a few years ago? One of the editors here asked to see it. You think you could send me the original film scans?”

“Sure,” she said. “Give me a second.”

She walked into her room, trying to focus, trying to push everything else out of her head.

Rachel still used film cameras for most of her personal work. She kept all her negatives in a locked drawer.

She reached for the key—but froze.

The entire cabinet was wet.

Before she could even process that, Sierra’s voice chimed from the doorway.

“Oops—Rachel, I’m really sorry. I spilled coffee earlier and it splashed onto your cabinet. I didn’t want it to stain, so I just… washed the whole thing with water. Hope that’s okay.”

Rachel’s heart dropped.

She didn’t say a word. Just unlocked the drawer.

The second she pulled it open, her stomach caved in.

Rows of negatives—years of work—were soaked.

Some were unraveling. Some had already lost their color. Others were knotted together like seaweed, floating in water turned a deep, dirty brown.

Three years.

Three years of her life—ruined. Gone.

All of it.

Everything was ruined.

Rachel stood frozen, shaking from head to toe, too furious to speak.

Aaron had shown up at some point. He stood at the doorway now, glancing at the open drawer, at the soaked, tangled mess inside. His tone was maddeningly casual.

“Figure out how much it’s worth,” he said. “I’ll pay for it—Sierra and I both will.”

That was it. Rachel snapped.

“Can she afford what she destroyed?” Her voice cracked. “Do you even understand what those negatives meant to me? Do you?”

Aaron frowned slightly. “What I understand is that they’re already ruined. Yelling won’t change that. Sierra was just trying to help organize my clothes. Spilling the coffee was an accident.”

“Oh, so it’s fine because it was accidental? Someone crashes their car and kills a person—do they just get to say ‘oops, my bad’ and walk away?”

“Rachel.” His voice went cold. “Don’t be ridiculous. Film rolls aren’t a life. You can take new photos. It’s not the end of the world.”

From her phone, Edmund’s voice came through, concerned. “Rachel? Is everything okay? Something happen at home?”

Rachel inhaled deeply and forced herself to steady her voice. “Edmund… the negatives might be… unrecoverable. I’ll try to reshoot the set and send you something new soon.”

“That’s alright. No pressure. It’ll take at least two weeks to get the visa processed anyway.”

“Got it.”

That’s when Aaron’s head snapped up. “Visa? Are you leaving the country?”

Rachel ended the call.

She didn’t answer him right away. Just lowered her phone, took a breath, and bent down to gather the mess on the floor.

“Edmund can’t travel much anymore. His visa expired, and he asked me to help him sort it out.”

Aaron narrowed his eyes. “Doesn’t his daughter still live here? Why isn’t she helping?”

Rachel didn’t even look at him. “Feel free to call her and ask.”

“I’m not that bored.”

“Then maybe don’t ask so many questions.”

Rachel spent the entire night cleaning her room.

Everything Sierra had touched—clothes, shoes, shelves—felt tainted. She didn’t even bother trying to save it all. The ruined things went into a pile in the back of her closet.

She managed to salvage a few of the negatives, but the damage had been done. The images were warped beyond recognition. Useless.

Her makeup was no better. The liquid ones had spilled out. The powders were soaked. Everything was destroyed.

Then came a text.

Sierra: [Just a warning.]

Two minutes later, the message disappeared.

Deleted.

It was calculated—just long enough for Rachel to see, but not long enough to leave proof.

1m738et,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Robot_News/comments/1m738et/ai_driven_erp_systems_future_of_nusaker_a_quiet/,AI Driven ERP Systems Future of Nusaker – A Quiet Revolution Few Are Noticing,"In the middle of 2025's tech hype—between the AI image generators and robotics arms that make coffee—there’s a quieter, more foundational transformation happening: the evolution of **AI Driven ERP Systems**, and one name is starting to surface more frequently among early adopters and startup founders — **Nusaker**.

If you haven’t heard of it yet, you will.

# Why ERP Is Getting an AI Overhaul

ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) has historically been the most rigid, complicated, and—let’s be honest—unloved software in a company’s stack. It’s where data goes to die, hidden behind outdated UX, manual workflows, and layers of human dependencies.

That’s exactly why **AI Driven ERP Systems Future of Nusaker** is such a game changer.

By embedding intelligent automation, predictive analytics, and adaptive systems into ERP workflows, Nusaker doesn't just optimize—it **restructures how your business thinks**. AI is not an add-on. It’s the brain.

# What Makes Nusaker Different?

Most legacy ERP platforms are just now awkwardly bolting on AI features. Nusaker started with AI at the core.

We're talking about:

* Autonomous inventory management
* Predictive financial modeling
* AI-powered CRM workflows
* Machine-learning-driven human resource allocation
* Natural language interfaces for operational control

That’s where Nusaker separates itself in the **AI Driven ERP Systems Future**. It’s not just reactive, it's **context-aware**. Your team doesn’t need to dig for reports — they’re surfaced, interpreted, and prioritized by the system.

# Real-World Connections: AI Robots in the Enterprise

What caught my attention is how Nusaker’s ERP framework echoes the rise of **AI robotics** in other domains — especially personal and domestic spheres.

For example, while ERP handles business intelligence, [desktop robot assistants](https://didiar.com/desktop-robot-assistants/) are quietly transforming how individuals work at their desks. Tools like [Miko](https://didiar.com/ai-robot-reviews/miko-ai-robot-review-2025/) or [Eilik](https://didiar.com/ai-robot-reviews/eilik-interactive-ai-robot-review/) mirror the same logic Nusaker applies to business operations: observe, adapt, automate.

Even in emotional contexts, [interactive AI companions](https://didiar.com/interactive-ai-companions-for-adults/) are helping users navigate loneliness and mental health. Imagine a future where your ERP isn’t just smart—it’s emotionally intuitive. Sound far-fetched? Not if you’ve seen what [emotional AI robots](https://didiar.com/emotional-ai-robots/) are capable of now.

# Automation Isn’t Just for Corporates

If you want a glimpse into the **AI Driven ERP Systems Future of Nusaker**, you don’t need to be a CEO of a mid-market company. Just look at what’s happening at home:

* [AI Robots for Kids](https://didiar.com/ai-robots-for-kids/) are teaching emotional intelligence and STEM logic
* [AI Robots for Seniors](https://didiar.com/ai-robots-for-seniors/) are assisting with health monitoring and companionship
* [Smart home robots](https://didiar.com/ai-robots-for-home/) are tracking energy usage, performing security checks, and even cleaning

These are all modular, AI-enhanced systems built for predictability, responsiveness, and autonomy — just like Nusaker’s enterprise model.

You can even explore detailed comparisons of the [best smart home AI robots](https://didiar.com/ai-robot-reviews/best-ai-robots-for-smart-homes-2025/) to see how close consumer robotics and ERP automation have become in functionality and design.

# Where It Gets Wild: Predictive Learning in Business Systems

One of the most underappreciated capabilities in AI ERP systems like Nusaker is **predictive modeling**.

In the same way [AI robots for kids](https://didiar.com/ai-robots-for-kids/ai-robots-for-kids-learning-emotional-intelligence-2025/) adapt to a child’s emotional and cognitive development, Nusaker’s ERP learns and evolves with your business operations.

What does this look like?

* It flags rising supplier costs before they affect your margins
* It suggests alternate production schedules based on weather forecasts (yes, really)
* It can shift marketing budget in real-time based on customer engagement data

Much like how [top educational AI robots for kids](https://didiar.com/ai-robots-for-kids/top-educational-ai-robots-for-kids/) adjust to individual learning styles, AI ERP systems will learn how *your* business uniquely flows.

# Is This Just Hype?

Not if you follow the deeper robotics and AI spaces. Platforms like Nusaker are following the same trajectory we saw with personal robots:

* Early clunky systems →
* More modular AI modules →
* Adaptive learning via cloud models →
* Seamless consumer/enterprise adoption

Look at how far [emotional AI robots for seniors](https://didiar.com/emotional-ai-robots/5-emotional-ai-robots-for-seniors/) have come. Now imagine applying that tech to a corporate budget forecasting engine. That’s the leap Nusaker is building toward.

And with the AI investment pouring in across categories—from [romantic AI gifts](https://didiar.com/romantic-ai-robots-for-couples-gifts/) to [affordable desktop assistants](https://didiar.com/desktop-robot-assistants/affordable-desktop-robots-assistants/)—there’s no doubt enterprise systems will soon be the next frontier.

# Will Your Business Be Left Behind?

If you're running a startup or mid-size enterprise and your ERP is still a glorified spreadsheet, you’re behind. Tools like Nusaker are the new standard.

Just like how homes are being reimagined with [AI voice-controlled robots](https://didiar.com/en/ai-robots-for-home/best-voice-controlled-ai-robots-for-smart-homes-in-2025/), businesses will evolve into **adaptive, AI-led entities**.

The future isn’t about scale. It’s about **learning systems**.

# Final Thought: The Ecosystem Is Already Here

Whether you’re exploring [AI robots for home](https://didiar.com/ai-robots-for-home/the-benefits-of-customizable-ai-robots-for-home/), gifting smart bots to loved ones with our [AI robot gift guide](https://didiar.com/smart-robot-gift-guide/), or building the next unicorn startup — the pattern is clear.

Modular AI systems, real-time learning, autonomous workflow.

That’s the DNA of the **AI Driven ERP Systems Future of Nusaker**.

And if your backend isn’t keeping up with your AI-powered front-end... it’s time to rethink what “smart business” really means.",1,1753257250.0,AI_Robot_News,0,1.0,False
1m738e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrimeDiscussion/comments/1m738e2/the_story_of_mark_defriest_the_houdini_of_florida/,The Story of Mark DeFriest: the Houdini of Florida,"**Mark DeFriest** (born August 18, 1960), known as the **Houdini of Florida**, is an American man known for his repeated escapes from prison, having successfully done so 7 times. Born in rural Florida, he was arrested for the first time in 1978, serving for a year. In 1980, DeFriest was sentenced to four years in prison for violating probation via illegal firearms possession, having initially been arrested for retrieving work tools that his recently deceased father had willed him before the [will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_and_testament) had completed [probate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probate). His sentence has since been repeatedly extended for having attempted to escape 13 times (including one count of armed robbery during one attempt), as well as collecting hundreds of disciplinary reports for minor infractions, leading to a cumulative stay of 34 years in prison.

https://preview.redd.it/ank0npajxkef1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e9f0b137b5e9049653ee50970bba9b1528c9714

DeFriest has cumulatively spent 27 years in [solitary confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement). Following publicity, DeFriest was granted parole and released on 5 February 2019. Ten days later, he was rearrested as he checked into a mental health facility.

# Early life

DeFriest grew up in rural [Gadsden County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsden_County), near [Tallahassee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallahassee), Florida, where he worked with his father. He was a known [savant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savant_syndrome)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_DeFriest#cite_note-WaPo-4) who could not quite understand people, but was able to build or fix just about anything. At six years old, he was disassembling and reassembling watches and engines. He often devised and conducted elaborate science experiments in his family's basement, saying he blew himself up a few times. While his mechanical knowledge was rapidly increasing, his psychological wellbeing continued to worsen.

DeFriest was close with his father, who encouraged his mechanical abilities, and the two had what filmmaker Gabriel London called ""a mechanical connection.""His father had served in [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) with the [OSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services), a predecessor to the [CIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA). This experience likely prompted Mark's father to teach his son the avoidance tactics, survival, and defense techniques that Mark describes as [guerilla warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerilla_warfare). DeFriest's father died suddenly in 1979. In his will, the elder DeFriest left his tools to his son, Mark.

# Initial arrest

DeFriest, who was struggling with mental health issues at the time, collected the tools. However, the will had not completed [probate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probate), which meant that, in the eyes of the law, the tools had been stolen. DeFriest's stepmother called the police and he was arrested. When the police came for DeFriest, he ran from them out of panic. He took a gun with him, but never used it or even brandished it before the officers. For the theft, DeFriest was sentenced to four years in prison. Subsequent escapes led to a life sentence as well as years of emotional and physical abuse within the prison system.

# Mental state and legal competence

DeFriest had always behaved erratically. Highly intelligent but lacking in social skills, he stood out in prison. This outsider mentality may have fueled his decision to attempt escape from every facility that ever housed him.

Five out of six psychiatrists deemed DeFriest incompetent and mentally ill. At the time, the dissenting psychiatrist, Dr. Robert Berland, believed DeFriest's behavior (which included assumption of false identities as well as his compulsive escape attempts) was [intentional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malingering). Based on Berland's assessment, the court allowed DeFriest to stand trial and he accepted a life sentence. Berland reversed his assessment decades later.

Today, professionals think DeFriest's behavioral problems are likely associated with [autism spectrum disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum_disorder), which may impair the development of social skills and cause an inability to judge the emotions of others.

# Prison escapes

DeFriest made his first escape after a month at [Florida State Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Hospital) in [Chattahoochee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattahoochee,_Florida). He put [LSD-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD-25) from the hospital's pharmacy into the staff's coffee, in a plan to slip out while the staff was under the drug's influence. The plan fell apart when security arrived and the ward was locked down. He and a few other prisoners attempted to scale the facility's boundary wall. DeFriest got over the fence, [hot-wired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot-wiring) a car, and made a successful escape before being recaptured and sent to Bay County Jail. He has made use of various creative inventions and methods throughout his various escape attempts, such as replicating keys from any available material after memorising their patterns and fashioning a zip gun out of a toothpaste tube. During one of these escapes, DeFriest stole a car using a gun, for which he would later be charged with armed robbery.

# Treatment in prison

DeFriest was subject to abuse by prison guards throughout his time in prison. He cumulatively spent 27 years in [solitary confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement).

He experienced the bulk of the abuse at the [Florida State Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Prison) (FSP), having been transferred there in 1982. Ron McAndrew, who served as warden from 1996 to 1998, described the northern Florida prison as ""ungovernable"", describing situations where squads ""composed of correctional officers roamed the cell blocks, beating and degrading prisoners with impunity"", with these officers additionally turning a blind eye to violence between inmates. He was a target of abuse due to his character: according to Bill Cornwell, DeFriest was a ""walk alone"", refusing to align with any gangs in the prison and mostly keeping to himself: ""Anyone familiar with the inner workings of a penal institution will tell you that an inmate who stands out, who is a loner, who is troubled and vulnerable, is imperiled.""

[Florida State Prison's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_State_Prison) solitary confinement served as an ""escape-proof"" cell, one that The [*Miami Herald*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald) reported held the only nonviolent inmate in the solitary confinement ward—one floor above the [electric chair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_chair). There, prison officials deprived DeFriest of books, magazines, radio, TV, windows, sunlight, water and toiletries for 11 days.

Although 209 disciplinary reports have been filed against DeFriest, McAndrew doubted the veracity of many of them: although he was aware of DeFriest engaging in less flagrant displays of rule breaking, he asserted in an interview with Cornwell that many of them were false accusations designed to prolong his time in prison.

DeFriest's attorney John Middleton told the *Miami Herald* that ""He's not [shanking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shank_(weapon)) or stabbing anyone. The reports are for possessing [contraband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraband). He's made his own alcohol. He's had weapons, usually defensive. He has not hurt people.

In 1999, DeFriest witnessed the fatal beating of [Frank Valdes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Frank_Valdes) who had been convicted of murdering a correctional officer. DeFriest was a few cells away and confirmed the medical examiner's conclusion that Valdes was beaten to death. For his protection, DeFriest was transferred to a prison in California.

# Documentary film

2014 saw the release, both in theaters and on [Showtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_network)), of director Gabriel London's documentary [*The Mind of Mark DeFriest*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mind_of_Mark_DeFriest). In his review of the film, [*The Washington Post*'s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post) Michael O’Sullivan wrote, ""London turns the portrait of an escape artist into a powerful indictment of the American prison system, which many reformers, London included, argue merely warehouses the mentally ill.

In the *Miami Herald* in November 2014, DeFriest's attorney John Middleton was quoted as having said ""we’re punishing him for being mentally ill. That's what's happening here.

# Parole hearings, release, and prisoner status

In the last 15 years, efforts to persuade the Florida government and [parole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parole) board to release DeFriest have included petitions started by his wife Bonnie DeFriest (whom he met through a pen-pal list), legal representation by John Middleton, psychiatrist Dr. Robert Berland's recanting of his assessment of DeFriest in the 1980s and outspoken positive reports from former warden of Florida State Prison Ron McAndrew.

DeFriest's parole hearing on November 19, 2014, in Tallahassee saw the unprecedented reduction of his potential release date from 2085 to March 2015. This would have made a possible release date of March 2015, but additional outstanding sentences for cocaine, [marijuana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijuana), contraband possession, and armed robbery were not first considered.

DeFriest was finally granted parole on February 5, 2019 with one of the conditions being that he spend 12 months in a mental health and substance abuse treatment facility. Community Outreach, Inc. in [Corvallis, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvallis,_Oregon) was agreed upon due to its proximity to his wife Bonnie's home. DeFriest entered the facility on February 7, 2019.

By February 13, Community Outreach revoked DeFriest's residence due to unspecified behavioral violations. This raised the question of whether the Oregon facility was appropriately informed, prepared or capable of providing DeFriest with the treatment, structure, and care he needed for a successful transition into public life, as did the revelation that DeFriest tested positive for [methamphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) at the facility. The director of the facility described DeFriest as exhibiting ""[bipolar mania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder)"".

As the behavioral issues and drug use were violations of DeFriest's parole, Oregon began his transfer back to the Florida state prison system only 10 days after his release. Although advocates were initially optimistic for a quick re-release and second try, as of 2022, DeFriest remained incarcerated in Florida.

# Best Sink Drain 2025: Top Picks, Reviews & Guide

The humble sink drain is often overlooked, but it is a crucial component of any functional kitchen or bathroom.A well-designed sink drain prevents clogs, ensures efficient water drainage, and contributes to a hygienic environment.Selecting the right sink drain can save you from costly plumbing repairs, unpleasant odors, and frustrating water backups. This guide provides a extensive overview of the best sink drains available in 2025, offering detailed reviews, comparisons, and essential buying recommendations.

[[Explore Top Rated sink drain on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=sink drain)

## Key Features analysis

The modern sink drain boasts several key features designed to enhance performance, durability, and ease of use. The sink drains in this review have been selected and compared based on these criteria.

**material Quality**

A sink drain's durability is largely determined by the material used in its construction. High-quality stainless steel is a popular choice due to its resistance to corrosion, rust, and staining. Brass is another excellent option, offering similar durability and a more premium aesthetic. Less expensive options may use plastic components, which can be more susceptible to damage and degradation over time. The thickness and finish of the material also play a crucial role in its longevity. A thicker gauge stainless steel, for example, will be more resistant to dents and deformation.

**Drainage Efficiency**

The primary function of a sink drain is to efficiently remove water without causing clogs or backups. The design of the drain basket,the P-trap configuration,and the overall diameter of the drainpipe all contribute to drainage efficiency. A well-designed drain basket will effectively trap food particles and debris, preventing them from entering the drainpipe and causing blockages. The P-trap should be properly installed to create a water seal that prevents sewer gases from entering the building. A larger diameter drainpipe will allow for faster water flow.

**Ease of Installation**

Installing a sink drain can be a straightforward DIY project, but some models are easier to install than others. look for drains that come with clear and concise instructions, as well as all the necesary hardware and tools. Quick-connect mechanisms, adjustable components, and standardized fittings can simplify the installation process. Online video tutorials can also be a valuable resource for DIYers. Some drains may require professional installation, especially if modifications to the existing plumbing are necessary.

**Clog Resistance**

Clogs are a common nuisance in sink drains, often caused by food particles, hair, and other debris. A clog-resistant sink drain incorporates features that minimize the likelihood of blockages. Removable drain baskets, multiple drainage holes, and internal baffles can definitely help prevent clogs from forming. Some drains also feature inline filters that trap debris before it enters the drainpipe. Regular cleaning and maintenance are essential for maintaining clog resistance.**Odor Prevention**

Sewer gases can seep into a building through a poorly sealed or improperly installed sink drain, resulting in unpleasant odors. A properly functioning P-trap is crucial for preventing sewer gases from escaping. The P-trap creates a water seal that acts as a barrier between the drainpipe and the indoor environment. Some sink drains also incorporate additional odor-blocking features, such as airtight seals and activated carbon filters. Regular cleaning of the drain can also help prevent the buildup of odor-causing bacteria and debris.

## Core Benefits

A high-quality sink drain offers several core benefits that enhance the functionality, hygiene, and longevity of your sink. Choosing the right drain can protect your plumbing and reduce maintenance.

**Improved Drainage Performance:** The efficient design of advanced sink drains significantly improves water drainage, preventing water buildup and potential overflows. Many users report that switching to a premium sink drain has eliminated slow draining issues, ensuring that their sink empties quickly and fully, even when dealing with large volumes of water.

**Reduced Clogging:** Superior sink drains feature enhanced debris-filtering capabilities that minimize clogs and blockages. The improved design of the basket strainer and integrated filters efficiently trap food particles, hair, and other debris before they can enter the drainpipe. This reduces the frequency of drain cleaning and minimizes the risk of costly plumbing repairs.

**Enhanced Hygiene:** By preventing clogs and promoting efficient drainage, modern sink drains contribute to a more hygienic environment.

1m733hd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m733hd,[UPDATED] Whole Body Whitening Routine,"[CROSSPOSTED]

DISCLAIMER: Camera and lighting may have altered the actual color. In reality, my skin is almost as bright as the initial pic. Mosquito bites and other dark spots faded but are still relatively noticeable. What works for me may not work for you. DYOR!

Posted a review last June and I wanted to share an updated version a month later with new products and different routines! For reference, I stopped using the products 2x a day because of how busy and hectic my sched got. In my new routine, I incorporated more body-caring products focusing on hydration. Alada really dried me out 🥲 

I found that Vit C works well with my body! I use this for pigmented areas. In around 2 weeks, significant changes were noticed. However, I also found that not all products containing Vitamin C work well.

I’m not sure if this is a universal experience, but I believe constant usage of the whitening products made me skin “immune” or used to it, making it ineffective. Giving your skin a break or switching to gentler alternatives are a must! 

TL;DR: The updated routine didn’t help me achieve my dream even skin tone but drastically improved the appearance of my problem areas (especially my UA). I found that using Vit C worked best. Also, determining how bright/white my skin truly is was difficult—it changes depending on the lighting (warm light = tan, sunlight & cool toned lights = white). Regardless, people have commented on how “puti” and bright I was 🤍",7,1753256699.0,beautyph,0,1.0,False

# Organic Coffee Options

If you’re concerned about the use of pesticides in your coffee, you’re not alone. Many coffee lovers are switching to organic options to enjoy their daily brew without the worry of chemicals. But how do you know which coffee truly has no pesticides? [Let’s dive into some organic coffee options that can ease your mind and satisfy your taste buds.](https://gomehedi.com/best-organic-coffee/)

# Certified Organic Labels

When searching for organic coffee, look for certified labels. These labels are your assurance that the coffee beans were grown without synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. The USDA Organic label is one of the most recognized certifications. Another certification to consider is the Rainforest Alliance. Though not purely organic, it ensures environmentally-friendly practices and some pesticide restrictions. Reading labels can help you make informed choices about what you’re sipping.

# Benefits Of Organic Coffee

Choosing organic coffee comes with several perks. Firstly, it’s better for your health. Without synthetic chemicals, you’re reducing your exposure to potentially harmful substances. Organic farming methods also support the environment. They encourage biodiversity and healthier soil, which is a win for the planet. Additionally, many find that organic coffee has a richer, more authentic taste. Have you ever noticed a difference in flavor between organic and non-organic coffee? Many enthusiasts claim a more vibrant taste profile in organic brews. This could be the result of natural growing methods that allow the beans to fully develop their flavors. When you choose organic, you’re supporting sustainable practices. It’s not just about what you consume, but how it impacts the world.

# Fair Trade Coffee

When you reach for your morning cup of coffee, do you ever wonder about the journey it took to get to your mug? Fair Trade Coffee is an option that not only elevates your coffee experience but also positively impacts the lives of farmers. By choosing Fair Trade, you support ethical sourcing and sustainable farming practices. This choice ensures that your coffee is free from harmful pesticides while promoting a more just and equitable coffee industry.

# Ethical Sourcing

Fair Trade Coffee is all about ethical sourcing. It guarantees that farmers receive a fair price for their beans, improving their quality of life. This ethical approach goes beyond fair wages; it also means investing in community development and environmental sustainability.

Imagine enjoying your favorite brew knowing that the farmer who grew it can afford healthcare and education for their family. By supporting Fair Trade, you contribute to a more equitable global economy. This ethical choice empowers farmers to invest in eco-friendly practices, ultimately benefiting everyone involved.

Have you ever considered how your coffee choice impacts someone else’s life across the globe? By choosing Fair Trade, you are making a conscious decision to support better working conditions and sustainable practices. Every sip is a step towards a more ethical world.

# Impact On Pesticide Use

Fair Trade Coffee has a significant impact on pesticide use. Fair Trade certifications often include stringent environmental standards that limit or completely eliminate the use of harmful pesticides. This ensures that the coffee you drink is not only delicious but also safer for both you and the planet.

Think about the health of the farmers and their families. Reduced pesticide use means fewer health risks for those tending the coffee plants. By choosing Fair Trade, you are advocating for safer agricultural practices.

Are you concerned about the environmental footprint of your coffee? Fair Trade’s focus on sustainable farming helps protect biodiversity and the natural ecosystem. Your choice can lead to healthier soil, cleaner water, and a better environment for future generations.

Making small, informed choices like opting for Fair Trade Coffee can create a ripple effect of positive change. So, the next time you brew a cup, consider the journey of your coffee and the impact of your purchase. Your morning routine can be a force for good.

# Shade-grown Coffee

Shade-grown coffee is a sustainable choice that protects the environment. Coffee plants thrive under the canopy of trees, mimicking their natural habitat. This method reduces the need for chemicals and supports biodiversity. For those seeking a pesticide-free coffee, shade-grown options stand out as a natural choice.

# Environmental Advantages

Shade-grown coffee supports diverse ecosystems. The trees provide a home for various wildlife. Birds, insects, and mammals flourish in these environments. The natural shade regulates the temperature for coffee plants. This reduces the stress on the plants and improves their health. Healthy plants mean better-quality coffee beans.

Forests play a crucial role in carbon absorption. The trees in shade-grown coffee farms contribute to this process. They help fight climate change by storing carbon. This method also conserves water. The tree canopy reduces evaporation, keeping the soil moist. Sustainable practices like these make shade-grown coffee eco-friendly.

# Pesticide-free Cultivation

Shade-grown coffee often requires fewer pesticides. The natural habitat supports pest control through biodiversity. Predatory insects and birds manage pests naturally. Farmers rely less on chemicals, ensuring cleaner coffee beans. This approach benefits the environment and the consumer.

Organic methods are common in shade-grown coffee. Farmers use natural fertilizers and compost. This enriches the soil and nourishes the coffee plants. Consumers get a healthier product with no pesticide residue. Choosing shade-grown means supporting sustainable and clean cultivation.

# Single-origin Brews

Imagine sipping a cup of coffee where every sip tells a story of its origin. Single-origin brews offer just that—a unique coffee experience with beans sourced from a specific region or farm. This specificity often translates to a cleaner, more transparent product, free from pesticides and chemical residues.

# Traceability And Purity

Traceability is key in single-origin coffee. Knowing exactly where your coffee comes from ensures purity. You can track the journey of your beans from farm to cup, verifying practices that prioritize environmental health.

Have you ever thought about what happens to coffee before it reaches your cup? Single-origin brews answer that question with clarity. These coffees often come from farms committed to sustainable practices, minimizing or eliminating pesticide use.

Next time you choose coffee, consider how traceability can guarantee purity. Buying single-origin means supporting transparency and clean farming methods.

# Regions Known For Clean Coffee

Several regions are renowned for producing clean, pesticide-free coffee. Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee, is famous for its organic farming practices, offering beans rich in flavor and free of chemicals.

Another top contender is Colombia. Many Colombian coffee farms embrace natural methods, promoting biodiversity and reducing chemical reliance. You can taste the difference in each sip—fresh and untainted.

What about Costa Rica? This small nation takes pride in sustainable coffee production, ensuring purity through eco-friendly farming techniques. The dedication to clean coffee is evident in every aromatic cup.

Next time you brew your coffee, think about the region it comes from. The choice of origin can be your first step toward a pesticide-free coffee experience.

# Decaf Alternatives

Are you a coffee lover who wants to avoid pesticides in your morning brew? Decaf alternatives can offer you a clean choice. Many decaffeinated coffees use methods that are both chemical-free and environmentally friendly. [Let’s dive into the options available for those who prefer their coffee without the caffeine kick but still want to keep it pure.](https://gomehedi.com/best-organic-coffee/)

# Chemical-free Decaffeination

Choosing a decaf coffee doesn’t mean compromising on quality or safety. Some processes remove caffeine without harsh chemicals. The Swiss Water Process is one such method. It uses only water to extract caffeine from coffee beans. It’s both safe and effective, maintaining the coffee’s taste profile.

An unexpected find? My favorite local coffee shop uses this method. Their decaf brew tastes just like regular coffee, minus the jitters. You might ask yourself, why haven’t more brands adopted this process?

# Popular Brands And Methods

Several brands offer chemical-free decaf coffee. Look for labels that mention the Swiss Water Process or CO2 method. These processes are natural and keep your coffee pesticide-free. Brands like Peet’s Coffee and Kicking Horse Coffee are known for their commitment to clean decaf.

Next time you shop, check the packaging. Does it mention pesticide-free or chemical-free? If not, it might be time to switch brands. Your coffee habit doesn’t have to compromise your health or the planet.

So, when you’re sipping your morning brew, ask yourself: Is my coffee as clean as it could be? The choice is yours, and the options are plentiful.

1m732k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TripWanderers/comments/1m732k2/what_is_the_most_visited_place_in_venice/,What is the most visited place in Venice?,"Venice's St. Mark's Square (Piazza San Marco) is undoubtedly the city's most visited spot, and I recently discovered why during my trip there last month. After exploring Venice extensively, I can confidently say this historic plaza deserves its reputation.

I spent several days wandering through Venice's maze-like streets, and St. Mark's Square kept drawing me back. The square is home to St. Mark's Basilica, with its stunning Byzantine architecture and golden mosaics. The Campanile (bell tower) offers breathtaking views of Venice's red rooftops and countless canals.

What really struck me was how the square transforms throughout the day. In the early morning, it's peaceful and perfect for photos. By midday, it buzzes with tourists and locals alike. At sunset, the atmosphere becomes magical as the light hits the basilica's facade.

During my exploration, I found that the best way to appreciate Venice's grandeur is from the water. I took a gondola ride that gave me a unique perspective of the city, including views of St. Mark's Square from the Grand Canal. If you're interested in experiencing this yourself, I booked through this reliable service: https://athometouch.com/Venice

The gondola route took me past other notable landmarks near the square, including:
- Doge's Palace (connected to St. Mark's by the Bridge of Sighs)
- The Clock Tower (Torre dell'Orologio)
- Procuratie buildings with their elegant arcades
- Countless historic palazzos along the waterways

One tip I learned: visit St. Mark's Square early in the morning or later in the evening to avoid the largest crowds. The square floods occasionally during high tide (acqua alta), so check tide schedules if you're visiting during winter months.

The cafes around the square are expensive, but I found the experience of sipping coffee while listening to live orchestra music at Caffè Florian worth it at least once. It's been serving customers since 1720!

Beyond the square itself, the surrounding area is packed with significant sites. The Rialto Bridge is just a short walk away, and you'll find countless artisan shops selling authentic Murano glass and traditional Venetian masks.

I particularly enjoyed watching the sunset from the square, as the fading light created beautiful reflections on the basilica's mosaics. The atmosphere becomes almost mystical as evening approaches and the crowds thin out.

For the best experience of both St. Mark's Square and Venice's waterways, I highly recommend combining a visit to the square with a gondola ride. It really helps you understand why Venice has captivated visitors for centuries.

If you're planning to visit, definitely consider booking that gondola tour I mentioned earlier - it includes views of the square from the water and other historic landmarks. The perspective from the water adds another dimension to understanding Venice's unique beauty.

Remember to bring a good camera - the photo opportunities are endless, especially when the light hits the water just right. And don't forget to look up - some of the most intricate architectural details are above eye level.",1,1753256598.0,TripWanderers,0,1.0,False

# Can You Use iPad as Second Monitor? The 2025 In-Depth Guide

Do you dream of expanding your workspace beyond the confines of your laptop screen? ⁣ Are you looking for a portable and versatile solution to boost‍ your productivity?  In recent years, the iPad has evolved from a mere tablet for⁣ entertainment to a⁢ powerful tool for work and creativity.  One increasingly popular use ⁣case is⁣ leveraging the iPad as a ⁢second monitor.

This adaptability ⁣promotes seamless ⁢productivity nonetheless ‌of your ​physical ‌location.

Improved ergonomics is frequently enough⁤ cited as a reason to use a second monitor. By positioning the iPad appropriately beside your main display, you can reduce eye strain and neck fatigue. The extra‌ screen can allow for a more natural posture, which can be ‌beneficial during long working ‌sessions.

**Connectivity Methods: Wired ‌vs. Wireless⁤ Options**

There are two primary⁢ ways to‌ connect ⁢your iPad to your computer‌ as a second monitor: wired and wireless. Each ⁤has its own advantages⁤ and drawbacks ‌in terms of speed, reliability, ‌and ⁤ease of ‌setup.

Wired connections generally offer the most stable and⁣ reliable performance. Typically, this ⁣involves connecting your iPad to your computer using a USB-C or Lightning cable. The advantage ‌of a wired connection is minimal latency and a consistent connection, making it ideal for tasks that require⁤ real-time responsiveness. Though, wired connections can sometimes be limited by cable length ⁣and ‌require the appropriate ports on ⁤both​ devices.

Wireless connections ​provide‍ flexibility and convenience. These methods typically rely on Wi-fi or Bluetooth to ⁤establish a connection between your iPad and your computer.⁢ While wireless connections offer greater ⁢freedom of movement, they can be susceptible to lag and interference, especially on congested networks. The performance of wireless connections also depends on the strength and stability⁣ of your⁤ Wi-Fi ⁤signal.

**software Solutions⁢ for Transforming Your iPad into ⁢a Second Monitor**

Several software solutions facilitate ‌using your iPad as a⁣ second monitor, each​ offering unique features and functionality.​ Selecting the right software is crucial for optimal performance and seamless integration into your workflow.

Apple’s Sidecar is a native macOS feature ⁤that⁢ allows you to use an iPad⁢ as a second display ‌with minimal setup. Sidecar supports both ​wired and wireless ⁢connections and offers features like Apple ⁤Pencil support and touch‌ input on the iPad, which can be mirrored to‌ your macOS device. Its seamless integration with the macOS ecosystem makes ‍it a preferred ‍option for​ Mac users.

Duet Display is a third-party application ⁣that works with both macOS and Windows. It ⁤offers a range of features, including adjustable resolution​ and frame rates, and supports both wired and wireless​ connections.‍ Duet Display is known for its compatibility with a wide range of devices and ⁤operating systems,making it a versatile‌ option for cross-platform users.

Luna Display is⁢ a hardware-based solution that ⁢uses a small dongle plugged ⁣into your computer to create a ​low-latency wireless connection with your iPad.  Luna Display is designed ⁤for professional creative workflows and offers exceptional performance ​with minimal lag. It is indeed⁢ generally considered the most responsive wireless solution available.

SpaceDesk ⁣is another application that lets you use an‍ iPad as a second monitor, focusing ​on providing a ⁢free and flexible solution with both wired and wireless connectivity.  While it might not offer all the bells and ⁢whistles of ​paid alternatives, SpaceDesk is a‌ solid choice for users‍ on a tight budget.

**Understanding Hardware requirements and Compatibility**

Before attempting to use your iPad as a second monitor,​ it's essential to understand the ⁢hardware requirements and compatibility considerations.  Ensuring that both your​ iPad and computer meet the necessary specifications⁤ will‌ help ensure a smooth ‍and trouble-free experience.

iPad compatibility is primarily resolute by the software you intend to use. Sidecar, ​such as, requires specific iPad models running iPadOS 13 or ⁤later, and a ⁣compatible ​Mac running ⁤macOS Catalina or later. Third-party applications like Duet Display ⁣and Luna Display frequently enough support a wider⁣ range of ​iPad ‌models, including older versions, ‍but performance ​may vary depending on the device's processing power.computer compatibility depends on ​the operating‌ system. Sidecar is exclusive to ⁢macOS, while Duet⁣ Display and SpaceDesk support both macOS and Windows.  It's crucial to check the minimum system requirements for each ​software solution to ensure compatibility with ‍your ​computer's operating system and hardware specifications.

Cable requirements depend on whether you opt for a wired or wireless connection. For wired connections, you'll need a​ compatible USB-C or⁣ Lightning cable to connect your iPad to your⁤ computer.  If using a USB-C port on your computer, you might need ⁢a USB-C ⁣to USB-C ⁢cable.  For Lightning ports on older iPads, a Lightning to USB-A‌ cable is needed.

**Optimizing Performance:⁤ Configuration Tips and ⁤Tricks**

To maximize​ the performance of your iPad as a second monitor, consider the following configuration tips and tricks:

Adjust screen resolution and scaling settings to match your primary⁤ display.‌ Mismatched resolutions can lead to blurry or distorted images. Experiment with different resolutions until you find the optimal balance between clarity and performance.

Reduce latency by‌ using a wired connection​ whenever possible, especially for tasks that require real-time responsiveness. Wireless connections⁤ are convenient ⁢but can ​introduce lag, particularly on congested ​networks.

Close unnecessary applications‌ on both your iPad and computer to free up‍ resources and improve performance. background processes can consume valuable processing power and memory, ⁤which can impact the‌ responsiveness​ of your⁣ dual-screen setup.

Keep ⁢your iPad ⁢and computer software up ​to date. Software updates often include performance ​improvements and‍ bug fixes ​that ‌can enhance the overall experience.

Use a dedicated ⁣stand or mount to⁤ position your iPad at an optimal viewing angle. This is not only more ergonomic, but keeps the iPad secure near the main monitor.

**Addressing Potential ⁤Limitations and Challenges**

While using‌ an iPad as a second monitor offers numerous benefits,it's essential to be aware of potential limitations and challenges:

Battery drain can ⁣be​ a concern,especially when using wireless connections. Keep your iPad plugged‌ in to⁢ a‍ power ‍source during ⁤extended use to ⁤prevent battery depletion.

Software compatibility issues can arise with certain ‍applications.​ some⁢ applications may not be optimized for dual-screen setups or‍ may exhibit compatibility issues with specific software solutions. It's essential⁢ to test your⁣ workflow thoroughly to identify any potential ‌compatibility problems.

Overhead resources consumed with multiple monitors can impact the performance⁢ of older‌ hardware. Older computers⁢ or iPads may‍ struggle to handle the‌ processing demands‍ of running two displays concurrently. Consider upgrading​ your hardware if ‍you experience ‍significant performance issues.

The lack of true multi-touch support for Windows users can ⁣be a limitation for‌ some. interactions on the iPad ⁣screen might​ not translate perfectly to the Windows habitat when using specific​ software⁤ solutions.

**The Future of iPad and Dual-Screen Workflows**

the⁢ integration of iPads into dual-screen workflows is highly likely⁣ to continue evolving in the coming years.  We can expect to ⁣see further improvements in software, hardware, and connectivity options, making the ‍experience even more seamless and productive.

Enhanced⁢ software integration will continue to be a driving force.  Apple is‌ likely to further refine Sidecar⁤ and introduce​ new features that leverage the unique capabilities of the iPad.  third-party developers will also continue ‍to innovate, creating new software solutions that address specific ‍needs and⁢ workflows.

Improvements in wireless technology, ⁣such as ⁢Wi-fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7, will likely reduce latency and improve the ‍stability ​of wireless connections, making them ⁣increasingly viable alternatives to wired connections.

Foldable displays and⁣ larger⁤ iPads may blur the lines ‍between ‍tablets and laptops, possibly leading to new form factors and use cases for dual-screen⁢ workflows.

**Conclusion: Is Using an iPad as a Second Monitor Right for You?**

The answer to whether you should use an iPad as‍ a second monitor⁢ depends on⁢ your specific needs and priorities. If you value portability, convenience, and seamless integration with the ⁣Apple ecosystem,​ Sidecar is an excellent option. For cross-platform compatibility and a wider range of features, Duet Display ​or⁢ SpaceDesk may be more suitable. Luna Display ⁣offers the best performance for demanding creative workflows.

Consider the potential ⁣limitations, such as battery drain‌ and software compatibility issues, before making a ‌decision.⁣ assess your hardware⁣ requirements and⁣ ensure that your ​iPad and computer meet the minimum specifications. Experiment with different ⁤software solutions⁤ and⁣ configuration options to find the setup that works best⁢ for your workflow. Ultimately, using an iPad​ as a second monitor can be a transformative way to ⁣enhance your productivity and‍ creativity, but it​ requires careful planning⁤ and execution.

The full-day tour takes about 8 hours, but honestly, the time flies by because there's so much to see and do.

Our tour started around 7 AM with a pickup from Waikiki. I initially worried that 8 hours might be too long, but it turned out to be the perfect amount of time to see the whole island without feeling rushed. The air-conditioned bus made the journey comfortable, and our guide paced everything just right.

What really made the time worthwhile was how much ground we covered. We started at Diamond Head, made our way to the stunning Halona Blowhole, and continued around the island hitting all the major spots. The North Shore was a highlight - we had enough time to grab some famous garlic shrimp for lunch and check out the beautiful beaches.

One of my favorite stops was the Waimea Valley and Waterfall. We spent about an hour here, which gave everyone enough time to either swim in the waterfall or explore the botanical gardens. The whole valley is breathtaking, and it's a nice break in the middle of the day.

Other stops included:
- Nu'uanu Pali Lookout (the views are insane)
- Tropical Farms for coffee and macadamia nut sampling
- Kualoa Regional Park (where they filmed Jurassic Park!)
- Dole Plantation (don't skip the Dole Whip - trust me)

Quick tip: The tour I took was through Go Tours Hawaii, and I'd highly recommend booking through their official partner [here](https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island). They're really well-organized, and the guides are super knowledgeable about Hawaiian history and culture.

The 8-hour duration might sound long, but it's actually perfect for seeing everything without feeling exhausted. Plus, you get all the entry fees included, and they handle the driving so you can just relax and enjoy the views.

Something worth mentioning - bring a swimsuit if you want to swim at Waimea Falls, and definitely bring your camera. Some of the views, especially at Pali Lookout, are absolutely incredible. Also, while lunch isn't included, the stops for food are well-timed and there are great local options.

For anyone on the fence about whether this tour is worth a full day of your vacation - it absolutely is. It's the most efficient way to see the whole island, and you'll get insights from local guides that you wouldn't get exploring on your own. The price point (around $154) is really reasonable considering everything that's included and how much ground you cover.

If you're planning to book, I'd recommend doing it early in your trip. It helps you get oriented to the island and often helps people decide which spots they want to return to later for a longer visit.",1,1753255909.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

## Core Benefits

The revamped popularity of beads curtains in⁣ 2025 stems ⁢from their diverse array ‍of practical​ and aesthetic benefits.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** Beads curtains add ⁢a unique layer of texture, ‌depth, and visual interest to ‍any space.‍ Whether you're‍ aiming for⁢ a bohemian ‍vibe, a touch of elegance, or a ‌modern minimalist look, there's a‌ beads curtain style‌ to complement your design aesthetic. Different ⁤materials and colors can dramatically alter the mood and ambience of ⁤the room.

**Space Division and Privacy:** Beads curtains offer a stylish⁤ and​ non-intrusive way to divide spaces without completely blocking light or airflow. They can be ⁢used to create visual separation between living areas, bedrooms, or even to delineate a home office. ​While not providing complete privacy, beads curtains⁣ offer a degree of visual screening,⁣ making them ideal for​ areas where you want to create a sense ⁢of⁤ separation without feeling closed⁤ off.**light filtering ⁢and‍ Ventilation:** Unlike solid doors or heavy curtains, beads curtains allow natural light to filter through while ‍also promoting⁤ ventilation. This creates a ⁤luminous ‌and airy atmosphere while still offering some degree of privacy. The amount of light filtering and ventilation will depend on the density and arrangement of the beads.

**sound Dampening:** ⁢While not ‍a primary function, certain types‍ of beads curtains, especially those made from denser materials like glass or metal, can offer‌ some degree of sound dampening. They can ⁤help to absorb sound waves, reducing echo and ‌creating a⁣ more ‍peaceful environment. This effect is⁣ more pronounced in curtains with closely spaced ⁤strands.

## FAQs Section

Navigating the selection of beads curtains often ‌involves addressing a few common questions among prospective buyers.

**What is the best way ⁢to clean a ​beads curtain?**
The cleaning⁢ method depends​ on the material of the beads. For plastic or acrylic beads, a mild soap and water solution with a soft cloth or⁤ sponge is ⁤generally sufficient. For⁣ glass or crystal beads, a ​specialized glass cleaner can be used. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as ⁢these can damage the beads or the finish. Always test the ‌cleaner on a small,inconspicuous area first.

**How do I ensure the beads curtain hangs straight and evenly?**
Prior to installation,​ carefully measure and mark the desired location ⁣for the hanging⁣ hardware. Use a level to ensure‌ the hardware is perfectly straight.Distribute the weight of the curtain​ evenly along the rod or header.If the strands are uneven⁣ in length, you can carefully trim them with scissors or use small pliers to adjust the bead placement.

**Can ‍beads curtains be used outdoors?**
Some beads curtains​ are specifically​ designed ​for outdoor use, typically made from weather-resistant materials like treated bamboo or UV-protected plastic. Check ‌the product specifications to⁣ ensure the curtain is suitable⁢ for outdoor conditions. Exposure to sunlight,‌ rain, and‍ wind can damage certain materials, so proper maintenance is essential.

*  Final round price: 10x higher
* BONK hit $4.5B, MELANIA $8B
* DALPY’s starting market cap? \~$24M. You do the math.



Backed by actual utility: DeFi staking, AI integration, NFT rewards. Built on Solana, but not just another meme.



On-chain activity hints at a major US-based exchange being involved. Similar wallet patterns showed up right before listings in the past.



US/EU traffic is surging. Community’s buzzing.

I’m putting $2K in. Worst case? I catch the early hype wave. Best case? BONK 2.0.

I hope this helps some of you as it's really hard, especially in the beginning.

First of all I didn't cut cold turkey. You can try, but i always failed. I went gradually over two weeks to really give time to adjust and not die in the first 5 days.

Second I chose a big reward of getting past my previous quit record (17 days lol) to keep myself motivated. I used [pouchless.app](https://pouchless.app/) to track it and it made quitting feel like a quest or a journey, so it was 100% easier.

Third I picked something to do when the cravings hit. For me this was coffee/energy drink/snacks/good food, some chewing gum, and a walk/training session. This kept me not relapsing when the cravings hit hard.

Fourth sounds like a cliche, but I it helped me the most. I really visualized and reminded myself why I was quitting. My life revolved around Zyn and I wasn't a good man to my gf with my mood swings. I was mean and didn't want to be anymore.

I still do crave them and it isn't easy even now, but it's definitely not as hard as the first month.

Please share your best tip as it would help me move forward and others as well! Be strong.",1,1753255230.0,QuittingZyn,0,0.99,False

I am doing the same suggestion again but this time I am also adding my experience with the coffee roasters I have tried so far. I am keeping it simple and rating them as **Highly Recommended, Recommended, Not Recommended and Hell No**. The judging is based purely on my own tastebuds and most of the coffee is brewed on V60, followed by Aeropress and a little of Espresso Machine and Mocha Pot.

My recommendation is based mostly on the taste of the coffee followed by packaging, delivery experience and cost.

Keep in mind this is a personal rating and the coffee quality may have changed from the time I have experienced it. Your experience will differ and that is fine. Please feel free to counter me in the comments. 

So here it goes:

1. Blue Tokai - **Recommended**
2. Flying Squirrel - **Not Recommended**
3. Kapi Kottai -  **Recommended**
4. Naivo - **Highly Recommended**
5. Coffee Mechanics - **Hell No**
6. Savourworks - **Recommended**
7. Quick Brown Fox - **Highly Recommended**
8. KC Roasters - **Not Recommended**
9. Araku - **Not Recommended**
10. Curious Life - **Highly Recommended**
11. Cauvery Peak - **Hell No**
12. Corridor Seven - **Highly Recommended**
13. Bloom Coffee - **Recommended**
14. Lavazza - **Hell No**
15. Rhine Valley - **Hell No**
16. GreySoul - **Highly Recommended**
17. FiveFarms - **Recommended**
18. Marc’s Coffee - **Highly Recommended**

1m72nis,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m72nis/i_asked_my_girlfriend_for_an_open_relationship/,"I asked my girlfriend for an open relationship, and I think she killed me.","When I asked her for an open relationship, I was hoping for a discussion. I wanted to talk about setting rules and boundaries. What I wanted most though, was for us to stay together. I loved her. I didn't need the open relationship, I just thought it was something we could both find fun. She had said she'd do anything for me, and we were both pretty adventurous. To be honest, she was more adventurous than me.

I didn't get a discussion. Rules and boundaries were thrown out of the window the second I stopped talking. What I instead got was a deep and cold stare. As I watched her face for some other reaction, I noticed her pupils were dialated. They began expanding until her eyes were completely black. Except, they weren't completely black, there were flecks of light continuing endlessly into the darkness.

I was so entranced I didn't notice she had risen from her seat and now loomed over me from across the table. She looked tall. Taller than she had ever been. A cold knot of fear twisted in my gut.

It didn't last long though, before I could run or scream or even sheild myself she LUNGED across the table and gripped my head between her hands. Her thumbs began pressing onto my eyes and I squeezed my eyelids shut as hard as I could. I heard myself screaming, and my only thoughts were on keeping my eyes shut as tight as possible. I could feel the immense pressure as her thumbs weaseled their way between my eyelids. There was nothing I could do. Her nails pierced my eyes and I saw a bright flash and felt intense heat as my eyes melted from their sockets.

The screaming grew distant, sounding more and more like it was coming from a far away place and not from me. Then, there was silence. The blinding white that had flooded my vision materialized into what felt more like a vast white space. My pain was gone, and I realized I could look around. Off to my left, I saw her. She was simply standing in the emptiness, watching me. I moved toward her, apparently I didn't need to walk in this place.

""Hi"" she said.

The only thing I could think to say was ""What the hell is going on!?""

I gestured around angrily and realized I had arms again. My hands instinctively shot up to my eyes. All they felt were deep sockets.

""What have you done to me?"" I said

""What have I done for us? Would be a better question."" she replied. ""You wanted an open relationship. I'm giving you an open EVERYTHING. No more rules, no more boundaries. Just endless possibilities."" She moved closer to me, gently placing her hands on my cheeks. Somehow, I didn't feel the need to recoil. ""BUT"" She added ""my power is now your power, and yours is mine. We are now inextricable."" Her thumbs again slid into my eye sockets ""We can be whoever we want, do anything we want to do, but now our relationship will last forever."" I felt my mind slipping as the dark, cold, ink of the void spilled from her cuticles. I felt it's infinite depth pooling deep in my skull, penetrating even deeper into my mind. ""It's the most open relationship you could ever dream of, because now we are both ONE"" Her thumbs slipped out of my head and rested gently again on my face. In her deep black eyes I saw the fierce dance of light that filled the past, and the infinite cool swirl of every possible future. In her eyes I saw it all. And she said

""Now we are both EVERYTHING.""

She let go of my head and my vision faded to black. What I once was no longer existed, but it was a part of what I was now. Time had lost all meaning, but at some point, I opened my eyes.

There she was, sitting across the table from me. She was looking at me with a knowing and sly smile. Her head was tilted, resting in one hand as her other absently spun a stirring stick in her coffee.

Her starry eyes danced as they looked into my own and she said ""so, anything you want to do?""",1,1753254954.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

From local comfort meals to unique dishes you won’t find anywhere else, Calgary’s got flavors that reflect its prairie roots and multicultural spirit.

Whether you’re just visiting, new to town, or a lifelong Calgarian looking to try something different, this list will show you the must-eat dishes that locals love. We’re talking about hearty classics, tasty takeout, and one-of-a-kind bites that truly represent what it means to eat like a Calgarian.

# Alberta Beef: The Star of the Prairie Table

If you had to crown one dish that truly represents Calgary, it would be Alberta beef in all its glory. Raised on nearby ranches and revered for its tenderness and depth of flavor, Alberta beef is more than just a steak—it’s a legacy. Restaurants across the city pay homage to it with everything from ribeye's to short ribs to gourmet burgers.

At **Vintage Chophouse**, the steaks are dry-aged to perfection, while **Charcut Roast House** elevates beef cuts with bold seasonings and rustic plating. Even casual joints like **Boogie's Burgers** make their patties from local beef, giving fast food an artisanal edge. What makes Alberta beef unique is the terroir—the clean prairie air, grass-fed upbringing, and tight quality controls.

No Calgary food journey is complete without trying at least one beef dish. Whether grilled, braised, or smoked, you’ll instantly understand why locals brag about their beef—it’s just different here.

# Ginger Beef: Calgary’s Greatest Culinary Invention

Ask any local what dish originated in Calgary, and you'll likely hear ""ginger beef."" This deep-fried, sweet-and-spicy creation was born in the 1970s at the **Silver Inn Restaurant**, where Chinese-Canadian chefs adapted traditional flavors to Western palates. The result? A crispy, tangy, addictive dish that’s become a staple on Chinese menus across North America.

The beauty of ginger beef lies in its balance—crunchy strips of battered beef tossed in a glossy sauce made of soy, vinegar, sugar, and fresh ginger. Served over steamed rice with sautéed vegetables, it's comfort food with a twist. While Silver Inn still serves the original recipe, many local spots have added their own flair, like adding chili oil, sesame seeds, or Szechuan heat.

Forget sweet-and-sour pork—this is Calgary’s contribution to global Chinese cuisine. If you haven’t tried ginger beef in its hometown, you haven’t really tasted it at all.

# The History Behind Ginger Beef’s Invention

Ginger beef didn’t come from China — it was born right in Calgary. Chef George Wong at the Silver Inn Restaurant first introduced this dish in the 1970s, transforming a simple beef stir-fry into a deep-fried, sticky-sweet, spicy sensation. It quickly caught on and became a Calgary legend. What sets it apart is the crunch, the bold soy-ginger-garlic glaze, and that addictive sweet-heat combo.

·         Spice level can usually be customized

# Perogies and Prairie Comforts

While not exclusive to Calgary, perogies have long been adopted into the local food culture thanks to strong Ukrainian, Polish, and Russian communities across the Prairies. These doughy dumplings—stuffed with potatoes, cheese, or sauerkraut—are the ultimate comfort dish during Calgary’s long winters.

You’ll find homemade-style perogies at local diners like **Heritage Bakery & Deli** or **The Prairie Emporium**, where they’re often served with caramelized onions, sour cream, and smoky bacon. Even upscale restaurants like **The Nash** occasionally feature perogies with elevated fillings like truffle mash or duck confit.

Beyond perogies, other prairie staples like cabbage rolls, borscht, and bannock also make appearances across the city’s diverse menus. These dishes remind Calgary of its roots—hearty, humble, and meant to be shared. It’s a warm plate on a cold day, and a taste of tradition passed down through generations.

# Why Perogies Are a Prairie Staple

Perogies — stuffed dumplings from Eastern Europe — have become a beloved comfort food across Calgary and the Prairies. With fillings like potato and cheddar, sauerkraut, or bacon, they’re boiled or pan-fried and served with sour cream and onions. They're hearty, nostalgic, and often handmade by grandmas or community halls. In Calgary, they symbolize cozy winter dinners, potlucks, and multicultural pride.

# Vietnamese Subs and Chinatown Classics

Walk down Centre Street in Calgary’s Chinatown and the smell of freshly baked baguettes, grilled meats, and pickled vegetables will draw you into one of the city’s most beloved food rituals: the banh mi. Vietnamese subs have earned cult status in Calgary, combining French and Southeast Asian flavors into a handheld masterpiece.

# What Makes Calgary’s Bánh Mì So Special

Calgary’s Vietnamese community has perfected the bánh mì — a Vietnamese sub that blends French baguettes with pickled veggies, savory meats, and fresh herbs. What makes Calgary’s bánh mì special is the use of Alberta beef or lemongrass chicken, spicy aioli, and always-crisp bread. They’re cheap, fast, and exploding with flavor, making them a top lunch pick.

“Father, I’m ready now. Please arrange my marriage. I’m going to divorce my husband Xander. If you still want me as your daughter, if you still want me as your family, then pick me up. Erase my identity. Help me disappear. So I can be free.”

I hung up before I could hear the disappointment slide into his voice.

Three days ago, I watched my half-sister and my husband’s mistress push me off a yacht while Xander laughed as I nearly drowned.

What’s worse is that I heard him say, “Just go ahead and kill the baby. I never wanted an heir that comes from her. I’ve regretted marrying her since day one. If it weren’t for Nadia leaving me for her career, none of this would’ve happened. She seduced me, so I had a night with her. Our parents forced us to marry, but it doesn’t matter now.”

So I lost the baby that night. And he never once cared.

That was the last straw.

I filed for divorce, packed my bags, and decided to marry the man I once swore I’d never choose because it was better than believing his lies.

But that wasn’t the end. I decided to fake my death, just to make sure he’d spend the rest of his life regretting he ever lost me.

\--

“Father, I’m ready now. Please arrange my marriage. I’m going to divorce my husband Xander.”

My voice cracked, but I kept my tone steady as I gripped the phone like it was the only thing tethering me to what little was left of me.

“What do you mean?” he asked, his tone sharp, biting like ice through the line. “You’re agreeing now to the marriage you rejected so stubbornly before? And divorcing Xander?”

I shut my eyes, pushing down the burn in my throat. “I changed my mind. I’m going to leave him. If you still want me as your daughter, if you still want me as your family, then pick me up. Erase my identity. Help me disappear. So I can be free.”

I hung up before I could hear the disappointment slide into his voice.

My hands trembled so badly I nearly dropped the phone. The hospital room was too bright, too white, the scent of antiseptic too clean to match the rot in my chest. I stared at the IV line snaking into my arm and felt the memory rise up like bile.

Three days ago, I was standing on a yacht off the coast of San Amaro. It was my husband Xander’s birthday party.

Nadia was also there. My half-sister. My husband’s mistress.

She sidled up next to me near the railing, “Why are you even here, Lauren?” she’d asked, twirling her glass lazily. “You’re always so out of place. You should’ve just stayed at home.”

I ignored her, but the words dug under my skin like glass splinters.

The yacht rocked gently beneath us. The party roared behind us — laughter, music, clinking glasses. Nadia leaned closer, her eyes glittering with something too dark to name. “Do us all a favor, sister. Leave. He doesn’t need you.”

I turned to shove past her and felt her hand on my arm. A single, deliberate push. My scream vanished under the splash as I hit the freezing black water.

“Oh no!” I heard her giggle. “She fell!”

I came up struggling for air, salt burning my eyes. I flailed in the darkness, each stroke more desperate than the last. I could see them above me — Nadia, giggling behind her hand, and Xander, my husband, glass in hand, head thrown back in laughter.

They didn’t move. They didn’t help. They watched me struggle as if I was an inconvenience, a stain on their perfect evening.

If it weren’t for the old fisherman who found me clinging to driftwood, I’d be at the bottom of that sea. But maybe that would’ve been kinder.

In the hospital, I begged the doctors not to take my baby. But the impact had been too much, my body was too battered. When they wheeled me in, I heard a voice cut through my sobbing.

“Just go ahead and kill the baby,” Xander told the doctor. “I don’t really care. Let both of them die for all I care.”

The doctor hesitated. “Sir, are you sure about this? It’s your heir—”

Xander scoffed, that cruel laugh I used to mistake for warmth. “I never wanted an heir that comes from her. I’ve regretted marrying her since day one. If it weren’t for Nadia leaving me for her career, none of this would’ve happened. She seduced me so I had a night with her, our parents forced us to marry, but it doesn’t matter now.”

Nadia’s voice drifted in, sweet and false. “Are you sure, Xander? It’s your baby… what do you think she would feel?”

He barely looked at her. “It’s better this way. I was already planning to slip something in her drink to get rid of the baby and her. Now I don’t have to. You know, you’re the only one I want, Nadia.”

Nadia whimpered, a pathetic, guilty laugh. “I’m sorry… for leaving you. For everything.”

Xander’s tone turned gentle. “It’s okay. As long as you promise you’ll never leave me again.”

“I promise,” she breathed.

And the last thing I heard was the steady beep of the monitor, mocking me as the life I carried inside me was scraped away while they planned the rest of their perfect life without me.

I snapped out of the memory when the door swung open. Xander stood there, a plastic smile on his perfect lips, carrying flowers and a tray of food like he was the devoted husband the world still believed him to be.

“Baby,” he said, voice dripping sweet poison. “I’m sorry I couldn’t come sooner, you know how the company is, so much to do. But I’m here now.”

Liar. In my mind, I could see him in Nadia’s bed, her red nails raking his back while my body lay here, stitched and empty.

“I made you shrimp,” he said, placing the tray on my lap. “Your favorite.”

I stared at the plate. Nadia loved shrimp. I was allergic.

“I don’t want it.”

He stiffened, eyes flashing. “Don’t be dramatic. Isn’t it enough that our daughter died because of you? Shouldn’t you apologize to me?”

Before I could speak, his phone buzzed. He didn’t even hide the name. Nadia.

“I’m going to answer this. Eat. Don’t make this harder than it already is,” he hissed. “I’ll be back.”

I heard his voice through the crack in the door. “It’s me, baby. Oh, okay. I’m coming. Don’t cry.”

And he never came back to me.

I let him be. I was done.

I finally called my lawyer.

“It’s me. Lauren Valeria. I want to file for divorce.”

Chapter 2

The lawyer’s voice on the other end of the line was steady but hesitant. “Mrs. Valeria, I just need to ask again, are you absolutely sure you want to proceed with filing for divorce? You do remember the prenup you signed with Mr. Valeria. It says you can’t legally divorce unless… well… unless one of you is dead.”

I pressed the phone harder to my ear, staring at the cold hospital floor. “Don’t worry,” I whispered. “I’ll be dead in a few days anyway. So just… finalize it.”

Before he could argue, I hung up. The silence that followed buzzed like static in my ears.

I started pulling the tape off the IV in my arm when my phone lit up on the side table. Another message. I didn’t even have to look to know what it was — it always came at the same time, like clockwork.

When I finally opened it, there it was: a video. Nadia’s giggle. Xander’s low laugh. The shaky image of them tangled together in his hotel suite. Again. The fiftieth video she’d sent me — always labeled Oops, sorry, wrong send. Always just enough to remind me who I really was in their eyes.

I didn’t cry. I didn’t break the phone. I didn’t even bother to watch it all the way through. I just tossed it into my bag, finished taping gauze over the IV mark, and zipped up my small suitcase.

I was done.

As I waited for the nurse to finish the discharge papers, my mind drifted to the first time everything really started to fall apart — long before Xander, long before the yacht.

I was fifteen when my mother shattered my world. She’d been cheating on my father with Nadia’s father for years — I’d always heard the late-night calls, the slammed doors, the crying. When the divorce papers came, I thought I’d stay with Dad. But Mom forced me to come with her. “A daughter belongs with her mother,” she said.

That was the first time I felt truly unwanted.

At first, living with Nadia didn’t feel so bad. She was sweet — bright, giggly, the daughter everyone adored. We shared secrets, clothes, and whispered about our dreams at night. But it didn’t take long for the cracks to show. When she didn’t get her way, she’d cry to our parents. And somehow, the blame always landed on me.

When we were older, I saw her drape herself over Xander at family parties. They’d been closer than siblings, even though they weren’t by blood. She told me they were together. But then she left him for her acting dreams abroad. He was drunk the night I found him alone on the balcony, eyes red, whiskey in hand.

I was stupid. I thought comforting him meant I mattered. That night was a mistake for him — for me, it was the start of my ruin.

When the tabloids leaked photos of us, the scandal nearly destroyed both families. A quick wedding was the only fix. I convinced myself it was fate. And for two short years, it almost felt real. Until she came back. Until she stood in my kitchen, sipping my coffee, saying I’d seduced her man.

Xander defended me, or so I thought — until I found them in my bed. It never really ended. It only grew more blatant.

And now they didn’t even bother to hide it.

My mind snapped back to the hallway when I heard footsteps. Voices. Laughter.

“…are you sure you’re okay to be here?” Nadia asked, her voice a low, sweet drawl.

“Of course,” Xander replied, so casual. “It’s not like she died.”

My breath caught behind the corner. I pressed my back to the cold wall.

Nadia giggled. “But what if she finds out about our baby?”

“So what?” he scoffed. “It doesn’t matter. You’re the one I want to have my child, not her. We’ll surely get married soon. I promise you.”

The words stung worse than any wound on my body. They disappeared into his room, shutting the door. Three months pregnant, I heard Nadia say. Their baby. And yet they’d stolen mine from me like it was nothing.

When I got home, I opened the closet and started packing. Everything Xander had ever given me — the clothes, the jewelry, the perfume he said made me smell expensive. All of it went into a black trash bag. He didn’t deserve to see me draped in anything he’d bought to cover the truth.

I was shoving shoes into the bag when the front door slammed. I froze as my mother’s perfume hit me before she did.

She slapped me so hard my ear rang. “What on earth did you do with our money, Lauren?”

I stared at her, blinking back the stars in my vision. “What are you talking about?”

She shoved a folder of bank statements into my chest. “Gambling? All those debts under your name? We lost everything! Do you know how embarrassing this is for me?”

I shook my head, my voice a whisper. “No… I didn’t— I never—”

“It’s your name!” she screamed. “You filthy, useless—”

Nadia’s voice floated in behind her like a snake’s hiss. “Mom, what’s wrong?”

My mother whirled around. “Your sister’s a gambler! She ruined us!”

Nadia winced — wide-eyed, all innocent sweetness. “Mom, I wanted to tell you. I found out weeks ago but… I didn’t want Lauren to get mad at me for telling. I’m so sorry, Mom. I should have told you.”

My mouth dropped open. “That’s a lie! You used my name—”

The second slap split my lip. “Liar! After everything I did for you!” My mother grabbed a handful of my hair and yanked until I screamed.

Nadia just stood behind her, eyes wide and fake-sorry.

That night, my mother hit me until I couldn’t feel my arms, my ribs, my legs — fifty strikes that burned like acid on my skin. Xander didn’t stop her. Nadia didn’t flinch. They just watched. Smirking. Whispering. Mocking.

But as I lay on the floor, curled around my bruises, I promised myself one thing: Just a few more days. Just hold on a little longer.

And then I’d be gone.

Chapter 3

I woke up on the cold concrete floor of the storage room, my body curled awkwardly under a scratchy blanket that smelled of mold and stale oil. Every inch of me ached — ribs, hips, the side of my face still raw where my mother’s ring had cut into my cheek.

I shifted, trying to sit up, and bit back a scream when pain shot through my shoulder. That was when the door creaked open and Nadia stepped in.

“Oh, look who’s finally awake,” she cooed, voice dripping with fake sweetness. She turned to Xander standing just behind her. “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of her.”

Xander’s eyes flicked over me like I was a stain on his floor. “Just let her rot. She’s nothing to us now.”

Nadia turned back, her smile sharpening like a blade. She shut the door and knelt next to me, pulling a first aid kit from behind her back.

“Let’s get you cleaned up, hmm? Poor thing.”

She pressed a cloth to the cut on my lip — too hard, too long, like she enjoyed the way I flinched. I hissed in pain, but she only laughed.

“You know,” she said, pressing down even harder, “you’ll never be enough for this family. Got it? Never. Not when you’re nothing but a little seductress stealing what was mine.”

My voice cracked. “I never stole him. You left—”

She slapped a hand over my mouth, nails digging into my cheek. “Shut up. I went for my dreams. You think you’re special because you were the perfect replacement? Look where that got you.”

She pulled out a battered lunchbox, flipping it open so the stale smell hit my nose immediately. “Eat,” she said, voice too bright. “I made it myself. Don’t be ungrateful.”

She shoved a spoon toward my lips, and I realized it was shrimp. My throat closed up on instinct — I was allergic. I turned my head away, but Nadia’s grip on my jaw was iron.

“Eat it, Lauren! Don’t be dramatic now. Eat it!” she hissed, jabbing the spoon against my lips. My stomach turned, bile rising up so fast I nearly choked.

In that moment, something in my mind flickered — a memory from when we were kids. Nadia and I giggling under blankets, sharing secrets. Back when we were sisters in the truest sense — until I won that school contest, until they put my face on the cover of the community paper. She’d been so furious. She’d told everyone I cheated. One by one, my friends turned their backs. The teachers glared. The principal called me a liar.

And Nadia just stood there, pretty and innocent, saying, “I’m sorry. I tried to stop her. She loves attention too much.”

The taste of the shrimp snapped me back. I gagged, vomiting onto the floor. Nadia moved back, shrieking in disgust. “You freak! You did that on purpose—”

The door flew open. Xander stepped in, annoyance already etched into his features. “What the heck is going on now?”

Nadia turned to him, her eyes wide, voice trembling. “I was trying to help her, Xander! I made her food and she threw it up! She hates me—”

Xander’s face twisted with disgust as he looked at me, weak and trembling on the floor. “You ungrateful woman. She’s trying to feed you and you can’t even be thankful?”

They mocked me then. Both of them. Their voices mixed together — little jabs, half-laughs, like I wasn’t even there. But I didn’t hear it for long. The edges of my vision went fuzzy, my head spun, and the world finally went dark.

When I woke up again, I was in a hospital bed. The walls were clean. The sheets smelled like bleach. A nurse hovered over me, frowning as she checked the bruises blooming across my arms.

“You’re lucky,” she said quietly. “You went into shock from the allergy and the injuries. You need rest.”

I stared at the ceiling, tears pooling but never falling. “Do you need me to call your family?” the nurse asked gently.

Family. The word scraped against my ribs like broken glass. I turned my head away and whispered, “No. There is no family anymore. I’m all alone.”

The nurse squeezed my shoulder, pity in her eyes. She left me with my thoughts. The steady beep of the monitor filled the room. My phone vibrated in my pocket. For a moment I thought it was my father — maybe he’d finally come for me. But when I answered, the voice on the other end wasn’t his.

“Lauren.”

My breath caught. Noah. His voice was the same as always — smooth, sharp, a warmth I hadn’t felt in years. “I heard from your father,” he said. “So you’re finally divorcing him, huh?”

I swallowed, my throat raw. “Yes. I’m done with him. I… I want out. Noah… do you still want me?”

He laughed — low, easy, like he already knew my answer. “Of course I do. You’re mine, Lauren. You always have been. I’ll pick you up myself — give me a few days. I can’t wait to make you mine for real this time.”

I shut my eyes, a strange heat blooming in my chest. “Yes. I’ll be waiting for you.”

When the call ended, I let myself hope for a breath — just a small taste of freedom. But then a shadow fell over my bed. I looked up — and there he was.

Xander. His eyes narrowed, lips curled into that cold half-smirk.

“Who were you talking to?” he asked, his voice low. “Are you cheating on me now, Lauren?”

Before I could reach for my phone, his hand shot out and snatched it from my fingers.

Chapter 4

“Open it now,” Xander demanded, his hand gripping my phone like it was his property — like I was his property rather than wife.

I forced my voice to stay calm, even as my skin crawled. “The password is my birthday.”

He snorted, thumbs tapping the screen. “Easy. December 5.”

A bitter laugh slipped out before I could stop it. “That’s not my birthday. That’s Nadia’s.”

His fingers froze mid-tap. He looked up, confusion flashing across his face before it twisted into irritation. “So what? Why are you being dramatic again, Lauren? It’s not that important.”

Not that important. Three years of marriage, one lost child, and he didn’t even know the day I was born. But deep down, I knew — he could recite every detail about Nadia without missing a beat. Her birthday. Her favorite food. The exact shade of lipstick she wore to bed.

Me? I was just… here.

I looked away, voice strained. “It never mattered, did it?”

He didn’t answer. He just tossed the phone back onto the side table, already bored. “Never mind that. Get up. You’re being discharged today.”

I blinked. “What? I’m not ready — I can’t even walk properly yet.”

“So what?” His tone turned sharp. “You’re needed at home. Your mother’s birthday party needs arranging. You know how she is, and Nadia and I don’t have time to handle it.”

My mouth dropped open. “Xander, I can barely stand! And I’m not apologizing to Nadia. She gave me shrimp on purpose, she knew I was allergic—”

He rolled his eyes so dramatically it made my blood boil. “There you go again, always blaming someone else. You’re so stubborn, Lauren. This is exactly why you’ve never been at her level. She’s everything you’re not — useful, graceful, wanted. You? You should’ve died instead of our child.”

His words punched the air out of my lungs. But before I could find something — anything — to throw back at him, the door swung open.

Nadia drifted in, her soft fake smile plastered onto her perfect lips. She carried a bouquet of lilies, my least favorite flower, and cooed, “How are you feeling, sister? Do you need anything? We were so worried.”

I stared right through her, the rage in my chest a furnace. I was done pretending.

Xander’s hand pressed down hard on my shoulder. “Apologize to her, Lauren. Right now.”

“No.”

His grip tightened, nails digging into my skin. “Apologize.”

Nadia tilted her head, pouting. “Don’t make this harder than it needs to be. Just say sorry, Lauren. I forgive you.”

Forgive me. For what? For surviving? For watching my baby die while they planned their perfect life?

I bit down the scream building in my throat and said nothing. No tears this time. Just cold silence. That seemed to annoy them more than any begging would have.

“Fine,” Xander snapped. “Be that way. But you’re still coming home to plan Mother’s party. You owe us that much.”

They dragged me out of the hospital before the nurse could even check my bandages properly. Back at the house, they left me in the guest room to recover — but I knew better. I was nothing more than a maid with a ruined body and a name they could blame for their messes.

I forced myself out of bed that night. I found every piece of our so-called life together — the wedding album we never finished, the love notes he used to scribble when he still needed to convince me he cared, the designer dresses he gifted me after every scandal. All of it.

I dragged the box to the garden, the cold air biting at my bruised skin. One by one, I dropped the memories onto a pile. When the match flared, I didn’t flinch. I watched the flames eat the lace, the letters, the lies. Sparks rose into the sky like tiny ghosts, each one carrying a piece of the girl who once thought she was loved.

I whispered to the fire, “Few more days. Just a few more.”

Back inside, I lay on the cold sheets, heart pounding as my phone buzzed on the table. The screen lit up with a single message from my father: Everything is ready. Noah will pick you up soon. It’s time to disappear.

I read it twice, my chest tightening in a strange, sharp way — part fear, part hope. Free. It didn’t feel real yet, but it was coming.

I pressed the phone to my chest and let out a shaky breath. I pictured Noah’s steady eyes, his warm voice telling me I was his. I pictured the way I’d walk out of this prison with nothing but a suitcase and my name finally wiped clean.

No more wife. No more daughter. Just Lauren — whoever that might be.

The next morning, they forced me to stand at the dining table, drawing up guest lists, talking about catering like nothing had happened. Nadia stood at Xander’s side, her hand resting on his arm like she’d never left it.

When our eyes met, she smirked — that little tilt of her lips that said, You’re still here. And you’re still nothing.

But inside, I felt it like a heartbeat under my ribs: Not for long.

Tomorrow, I'll be gone.

Chapter 5

The morning of my mother’s birthday dawned clear and cold. I sat in my vanity, pretending to fuss with my hair. I could hear Nadia’s high laugh echoing down the hallway

One more hour, I told myself. Just let them leave.

The door slammed open behind me. Nadia stood there in her silk robe. Her eyes flicked to my chest and then she lunged. I didn’t even have time to flinch before her fingers closed around the thin silver chain my father had given me when I turned sixteen.

“Give that back!” I shouted, grabbing at her wrist, but her other hand was already fisted in my hair, yanking me backward until I cried out.

“This? This cheap little thing?” she sneered, her breath hot against my ear. “You don’t deserve it. Daddy’s favorite, huh? How’s that working out for you now?”

I grabbed her wrist, yanking the necklace back so hard it cut into my palm. “It’s mine, give it back!”

She laughed in my face. “You think he cares about you now? You think anyone does?”

Something inside me snapped. My palm came up before I could stop it, I slapped him.

Nadia froze for a split second, shock flashing in her eyes, before she recoiled, pressing her fingers dramatically to the red mark blooming on her skin.

The door slammed open. Xander’s voice sliced through the air. “What is going on?”

Nadia let out a shaky little sob, eyes wide and brimming with tears that weren’t real. “She hit me, Xander! I just wanted to borrow the necklace for the party, it would’ve matched my dress, but she went crazy! I was only trying to help her get ready—”

“That’s a lie!” I hissed. “She took my necklace—”

But before I could finish, my mother appeared behind him, hair perfect, eyes glittering with the kind of disgust she never bothered to hide. “Lauren, you ungrateful child. You can’t behave for one day?”

My fingers tightened around the tiny chain, my father’s last promise digging into my palm. “She stole it, she—”

“Enough!” Xander snapped. “You’re not going. I won’t have you embarrassing us in front of important people. You stay here.”

“You can’t—”

My mother’s cold hand came down on my shoulder. “You’ve been nothing but a shame since into this family. You stay here and think about what you cost us.”

Before I could blink, the door slammed shut. The lock clicked.

I pressed my back to the door, my shoulders trembling as I sank to the floor.

Through the door, I could hear Nadia’s giggle, soft and smug. “It’s better this way, don’t you think? We can’t let her ruin today.”

Their footsteps faded down the hall, their voices trailing off with the sound of the cars pulling away one by one. And then finally, the house fell still.

I grabbed my phone, my hands shaking as I pulled up Noah’s number. I pressed call, praying he’d answer. He did before the first ring even finished.

“Lauren?”

His voice was so warm I almost broke. “They locked me in,” I whispered. “They left for the party, but they locked me in. I’m ready to go, please, Noah. I can’t stay here.”

A low growl rumbled through the line, that same protective anger that made me believe him when he said he’d save me. “Stay right where you are. I’ll be there soon, baby. You hear me? You’re not going to spend one more night in that place.”

A tear slipped down my cheek. I didn’t bother to wipe it away. “I’m ready to leave.”

Third person’s pov

Back at the grand ballroom, the celebration that was supposed to showcase perfection was already teetering on chaos.

Guests milled around awkwardly beneath the glittering chandeliers. The tables were half-empty, no servers in sight, and the main buffet remained sealed shut in the catering trucks that never arrived. No music drifted through the hall.

Lauren’s mother was the first to snap. Her sharp voice cut through the crowd like a whip as she rounded on Xander, who was standing near the bar, checking his phone for the third time in five minutes.

“Where is she?!” her mother hissed. “Where is that useless girl? She’s the one who was supposed to handle all this, the catering, the band! I want her here now.”

Xander’s jaw twitched. He hit call again. Voicemail. He tried again. Voicemail. A few of the guests had started whispering and pointing at the tense knot of family near the stage. Someone coughed to hide a laugh when the music still didn’t start.

“She’s not picking up,” Xander muttered, teeth grinding together. “You! Go check if she’s at home. Now.”

A hush rippled through the room as a butler stepped forward, carrying a small, elegant box with a white ribbon tied perfectly on top.

“Sir?” the butler said, clearing his throat nervously. “This just arrived for you. Delivered directly at the gate. It’s… from Mrs. Lauren.”

Xander ripped the lid off then froze. Inside, nestled on crisp white paper, were two things: Lauren’s wedding ring and a single, crisp set of divorce papers. Her signature sat at the bottom in steady, deliberate strokes.

The blood drained from Xander’s face. Nadia peered over his shoulder, her painted lips curling into a sneer. “Oh. She’s divorcing you finally?” she said.

Lauren’s mother let out a furious screech, drawing startled bursts from the guests. “Find her! Now! She’s not going to humiliate this family, not like this. Bring her back here this instant!”

But before they could move, the butler stepped forward again, sweat beading on his brow. “Sir, there’s more. The… the house, it’s—”

“What?” Xander barked. “What about the house?”

The butler swallowed hard. “There’s a fire, sir. It’s spreading through the kitchen, the storage, the staff are saying it’s bad. The whole back wing is gone.”

“And Lauren? Is she there? Where is she?” Xander asked.

The butler hesitated. Everyone fell silent, watching his lips move, waiting for the words that would break the last fragile thread holding them all together.

“I’m afraid,” the butler said with a raspy voice, “she was still inside. She… she burned with the fire… and it seems like Mrs. Lauren is dead.",1,1753254457.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Thinking of something super chill – no pressure to code at the first meet, just come hang out and see if there’s vibe. If people are into it, maybe we can make it a weekly or fortnightly thing.

**Where:** Foyles café, 5th floor (Charing Cross Road, nearest tube is Tottenham Court Road) – seen other hacker/meetup groups there before, decent spot with plenty of space and coffee.  
**When:** Thursday 25th July or Tuesday 29th July, around 6PM–8PM (open to whichever works better generally for folks).

Let me know if you're interested and which date works better – I’ll confirm based on responses and post an update. Bring yourself, your ideas, and maybe a laptop if you feel like it.

I have a 2.5-year-old and a 9-month-old who is currently teething hard (and possibly fighting off a bug he passed on to my husband). Oh, and I’m pregnant too.

So here’s my list of things that have traumatised me since becoming a mom. No particular order, just vibes.

• Hand, foot, and mouth disease. Enough said
• Projectile vomiting
• High fevers
• Crying that just won't stop
• Carrying a baby around for hours because sitting down is illegal 
• Hair pulling, more triggering than anything else 
• Getting smacked in the eye for no reason
• When they dig their toes into my thighs so they can push away
• Diaper changes with a baby who WILL NOT SIT STILL
  • Bonus: pooping 7 times a day with the worst diaper rash
• Postpartum depression, especially the neglect that can come with it

I can probably think of a few more, but my brain is mashed potatoes at the moment and I need another coffee just to feel alive. ",1,1753254386.0,u_Busy_Tangerine1630,0,1.0,False
1m72huc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m72huc/dear_husband_we_were_never_married_summary_review/,"Dear Husband, We were never Married: Summary, Review and Reading Link","**Hit like, leave a comment — I’ll arrange it fast!**

“I’m sorry, Miss Nadine Smith, but we can’t issue a copy of this marriage certificate because you were never legally married to Mr. Scott Jones.”

That’s impossible. Scott said he registered our marriage three years ago.

“Miss Smith, Mr. Jones is married but not to you. He’s been married for three years to a woman named Jasmine Rivera. Does that name mean anything to you?”

Jasmine. My best friend. Three years ago, Jasmine had been pushed from a rooftop by one of Scott’s enemies who’d wanted to hurt him and they thought she was the woman he truly loved.

She went into a coma. Scott forced me to take care of her because he said we owed my life to her. Then, I overheard.

“Nadine? She doesn’t even know our marriage is fake. You know she followed me for twenty years? Like a lost puppy. I pitied her — that’s why I decided to use her.”

What’s worse? Jasmine finally woke up, and he chose her over me when his enemies tried to kill me, making me lose our child.

That was the last straw. I called my mother to arrange a new marriage, packed my bags, and walked away…, only for him to beg on my wedding day, but he was already too late to love me.

\--

“I’m sorry, Miss Nadine Smith, but we can’t issue a copy of this marriage certificate because you were never legally married to Mr. Scott Jones.”

I blinked at the woman behind the counter. I clutched my hands together until my nails dug into my palms.

“That’s… that’s not possible. I’m Mrs. Nadine Jones. I just need a reprint. I accidentally spilled coffee all over the old copy when I was cleaning my husband Scott's office.”

The clerk’s polite smile never faltered. She pushed her glasses up her nose, tapped a few keys, and turned the screen slightly my way — a blur of lines and legal text I couldn’t focus on. “Miss Smith. ”

I felt my breath catch. My lips felt too big for my mouth. “No. You don’t understand. He told me he registered it after the church ceremony was postponed. He showed me the certificate. I’ve been living with him for three years. We’re married.”

Her voice softened, like she was explaining something to a child who couldn’t grasp their numbers yet. “Miss Smith, I can’t change what the records say. Mr. Jones is married but not to you. He’s been legally married for three years to a woman named Jasmine Rivera. Does that name mean anything to you?”

My knees nearly buckled. Jasmine. Of course I knew her. How could I not? She was my best friend. So, how come?

I stumbled away from the counter, mumbling something that probably sounded like thank you but tasted like acid in my mouth.

I don’t even remember how I got home. One moment I was standing there with my world split open like rotten fruit, the next I was climbing the marble stairs of Scott’s estate on autopilot, my palms still sticky from gripping the steering wheel too hard.

Three years ago, I was supposed to marry Scott in that white church on the hill. My mother had picked the flowers. Jasmine had helped me choose the dress. And then the news came: Jasmine had been pushed from a rooftop by one of Scott’s enemies who’d wanted to hurt him and they thought she was me. They thought she was the woman he truly loved. But she wasn’t supposed to be there. It was supposed to be me.

She survived, if you can even call it that. I still see her lying on those silk sheets, eyes half-open but never seeing. Her brother Condor moved into the estate too because he was also sick. Scott said we owed it to her. I believed him. I believed everything he told me.

I spent three years nursing my best friend, scrubbing her skin with warm cloths, combing out the tangles in her hair. Feeding her, talking to her, praying she’d come back to me. I cooked for Scott, smiled when he kissed my forehead, accepted that he couldn’t touch me more because he was stressed. I believed I was his wife. I let him show me that piece of paper and never questioned it again.

Stupid. So stupid.

I was halfway down the hallway when I heard their voices — Scott’s low, calm baritone and Condor’s quieter hum. The door to the study was cracked open. I should’ve walked away. Instead I froze.

“…I really want to thank you for everything, Scott. For Jasmine. For me,” Condor was saying.

“Come on, Condor,” Scott said, that warm laugh I used to believe in. “You know how much I love your sister. Not a day goes by I don’t regret what happened. It wasn’t supposed to be her who got pushed. It was supposed to be Nadine. That’s why I married her — to fool them into thinking she was the one I loved. To keep the enemy away from Jasmine.”

My breath snagged in my throat. I pressed my back to the cold wall. My ears rang so loudly I almost didn’t hear Condor’s next question.

“What if Nadine finds out? What if she leaves?”

Scott scoffed. “Nadine? She’ll never find out. She doesn’t even know our marriage is fake. And even if she did… she loves me too much to ever leave. You know she followed me for twenty years? Like a lost puppy. I pitied her. That’s why I decided to use her. So I married her.”

I don’t know how long I stood there. Long enough to feel my face go numb, my legs go weak. I stumbled down the hallway like a ghost in my own house. Not mine, I corrected myself. Nothing here was mine. Not even him.

When I reached my room, I didn’t cry. I didn’t scream. I picked up my phone, fingers shaking so hard I almost dropped it twice. I scrolled to the only number that mattered now.

My mother’s voice answered on the second ring. “Nadine? Sweetheart? What is it?”

“Mom,” I said, my voice so calm it scared me. “About the marriage you were arranging for me before… the one I turned down because I said I loved Scott?”

“Yes…?”

“Arrange it again,” I whispered, my throat raw, my heart breaking wide open for the last time. “I’m coming home. Please. I’m done here.”

Chapter 2

“Please… arrange it. I want it now. And I’m coming home, too.”

On the other end of the line, my mother went quiet. I could hear the faint clink of her bracelet, the rustle of her silk robe — it all felt so far away, like another world.

“What do you mean, Nadine? You chased Scott Jones for ten years,” she hissed, disbelief cracking through her calm tone. “You begged me to stop that arrangement back then because you said you loved him. And now what? You want me to fix this marriage you rejected so stubbornly?”

“I was mistaken,” I said, my throat raw. I sank onto the edge of my bed, knees shaking. “I want to leave, Mom. Please. Have that man you wanted me to marry come pick me up. One week. That’s all I’m asking for.”

“That’s so fast, darling.” Her voice softened, like I was fifteen again, crying into her lap after Scott ignored me at prom. “What happened? Did you two fight? What about the divorce? Did he sign the papers?”

I laughed, a dry, empty sound. “No need for that. I was never married.”

Before she could say anything else, I hung up. I didn’t want to hear her pity or her scolding. I just wanted it to be done.

When I turned around, my blood froze in my veins. Scott stood at the door, his arms crossed, eyes dark and narrowed.

His shadow fell across the carpet like a stormcloud. “What on earth was that, Jasmine?”

My stomach twisted. Jasmine. He couldn’t even get my name right sometimes. “Who were you talking to? What do you mean you were never married? Huh?” He took a step forward, voice rising. “What’s this now? Are you being dramatic again? Is this because I didn’t agree to that stupid anniversary trip you kept begging about?”

I opened my mouth but nothing came out. He stalked closer, his tone softening just enough to make my skin crawl. “Didn’t I say we can’t go right now? Your best friend is in a coma. Her brother is still paralyzed. You have to take care of them, we have to. Once Jasmine wakes up, we’ll go. I promise, baby. We’ll go see the aurora borealis together. Wouldn’t you love that?”

His words slithered around me like a snake I’d let coil around my neck for years. I saw it all now — how Jasmine was always there between us. Always. Even before the coma. Even before the rooftop. In high school, I thought she was helping me get closer to him. Writing my letters. Handing him my gifts. But she was the one he’d call at night. The one he’d smile at when he thought I wasn’t looking. My best friend — my betrayal wrapped in a ribbon.

I must’ve been staring too long because Scott’s voice snapped like a whip. “What? Who are you talking to in that head of yours? Are you insulting me now? Say something!”

My eyes burned as tears finally spilled over. I didn’t even try to wipe them away. He paused, his anger shifting into that pathetic, boyish panic he always used to reel me back in. “Oh God, baby, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to shout. I hate seeing you cry. You know that, right? You’re hurting me when you cry like this…”

He pulled me into his arms, his hand sliding behind my neck like it always did when he kissed me. His lips brushed mine but I felt nothing. Nothing but disgust. Once, I would’ve melted. Once, I would’ve forgiven everything with just this. But now?

Now I knew what that kiss really cost me.

I pulled back, my voice flat. “I have a stomachache.”

He frowned, brushing a tear from my cheek with his thumb. “A stomachache? That’s all? Why didn’t you say so? I’ll call the driver. We’ll get you to the hospital right now.”

He pressed his phone to his ear, barking orders like he always did. I stood there like a ghost, watching him fuss, trying to remember when I ever felt safe in his care.

We drove in silence for a while. He held my hand, tracing circles on my skin that made my stomach twist. For a second, I almost believed it — this little lie that he cared. But then his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, and just like that, I vanished from his mind.

“What? Jasmine’s awake?” His eyes lit up in a way I’d never seen before — not for me. “Turn the car around. We need to go back. I have to be there. She’ll want to see me.”

I stared at him. “What about me? I’m sick, Scott.”

He looked at me like I was an insect crawling across his precious floor. “It’s just a stomachache, Nadine. Don’t be dramatic. Driver, pull over.”

The car slowed to the side of the road. Scott opened the door and practically shoved me out. The rain started in slow, icy drops that slid down my neck.

“Take this,” he said, tossing his black credit card at my feet like a bone for a starving dog. “Get a taxi to the hospital. You’ll be fine.”

“Scott—”

“Stay here,” he snapped at me, and then he was gone. The door slammed. The car sped away into the night — back to Jasmine. Back to the woman he always loved.

I stood there on the side of the road, my hair plastered to my face, my hands clutched to my chest. The rain soaked through my coat in seconds. I could feel the cold all the way to my bones.

I closed my eyes and whispered to the darkness, “Just one more week. One more week… and I’ll be free.”

Chapter 3

I remembered riding the taxi that night, the cold seat sticking to my soaked clothes. I didn’t even have the energy to cry anymore. I just wanted to get to the hospital, check my stomach, and try to feel like a human being again.

But halfway through the ride, the driver glanced back at me with a strange smile, and before I could ask anything, I heard a hiss.

A sharp, chemical smell flooded my nose.

I coughed. “What are you—”

And then everything went dark.

When I woke up, my head was spinning and my body felt like it was made of lead. My wrists were bruised and tied behind me. My legs ached. My back was cold against concrete.

Where am I? The room was dim and smelled like rust and old oil — a warehouse. Somewhere abandoned. Somewhere no one would find me.

Footsteps echoed.

“W-What’s happening?” I croaked, my throat dry, voice barely audible.

One of the men walked up to me, face partially masked. “Shut up. You’re awake. Good. Call Scott.”

“Why?” I rasped, trembling.

“Because your dear husband owes us money. He used us, promised deals, deals he never fulfilled. He’s a liar. Now he has to pay.”

“I—I don’t understand,” I whispered. “I didn’t do anything. I’m not part of this—”

“Yeah?” The man snarled. “Then why did he send his own wife instead of meeting us? Huh?”

I froze. Wife. I wasn’t even legally married to him.

“But I’m not—” I stopped myself. They wouldn’t believe me anyway.

“No, I won’t believe you now,” the other guy muttered. “We got the wrong girl three years ago that is why you live but we won’t let you now…”

I blinked. So it was Scott’s fault. Everything. Jasmine being pushed. Me being kidnapped. All tied to the lies he fed these people. And now I was the collateral damage.

“Call him,” they barked. “Now.”

My fingers were shaking as I dialed.

He answered on the second ring.

“Scott,” I cried. “Help me—please. I’ve been kidnapped, I’m hurt—”

“Oh my god,” he sighed. “Seriously? Nadine? This again?”

“What—what are you talking about?” I whispered, heart plummeting.

“I’m taking care of Jasmine right now,” he snapped. “Don’t start with your attention-seeking stuff. Just get back here. She needs food. You should be helping instead of playing games.”

Then the line cut.

I stared at my phone in disbelief.

The men heard it. “Tch. Worthless,” one said, before slapping me across the face. “It seems it was truly Jasmine, so what are you?”

I felt my lip split.

Me? I guess… nothing.

Still, they didn’t let me go. They started torturing me and I heard they would kill me so that Scott would know his place. I could only cry for help… but none came.

The next thing I remembered was being dumped in front of the hospital like trash.

When I woke again, I was in a bed. The air smelled sterile. The fluorescent lights stung my eyes.

“Don’t move too much,” a nurse said gently. “You lost a lot of blood.”

I blinked slowly, my voice raspy. “What… happened?”

“You were found unconscious and bruised. Someone called it in anonymously. But…” she hesitated.

“But what?” I asked.

“I’m sorry to inform you… you lost the baby.”

“…What?”

I stared at her, unmoving.

“You were three months pregnant.”

I swallowed hard. “I didn’t even know,” I whispered. “I didn’t know because I’m… I’m always irregular.”

“I’m sorry,” she said softly. “Do you want me to call someone for you?”

“My phone,” I muttered.

She handed it over.

It was still working. I stared at the screen. Still no messages. No calls.

I tried calling Scott again. Voicemail.

I stared at the ceiling for what felt like hours.

Then, hungry and weak, I pushed myself up and wandered the halls in my hospital gown. I passed a nurses’ station, then a quiet corridor.

Then I heard a voice I hadn’t heard in three years.

Jasmine.

“…didn’t I tell you to kill her? Why is she still alive?” she hissed.

My heart dropped.

“I’m awake now. So she should be dead. Why is she even in this hospital?” she snapped.

“She was saved,” the man replied. “Some guys showed up. We didn’t expect it. We had to run.”

I stumbled back a step.

Saved? Someone saved me?

But who?

“Do it properly next time,” Jasmine ordered coldly. “And never show your face to me again unless I call you and never tell anyone about this! Got it?”

Footsteps. I backed up quickly, hiding behind a corner as the man exited. I was shaking.

Then—

“There you are!”

I spun around.

Scott.

Smiling.

“Great, you’re here already!” he said, like we were just bumping into each other in a mall. “Jasmine’s so excited to see you. She wants her usual milk tea from that café you love. Could you go get it for her?”

I blinked at him.

Did he not see my bandages?

Did he not care?

“No,” I said quietly.

“What?” His smile faded. “What do you mean no?”

“I don’t want to.”

His brow furrowed. “Are you disobeying me now? What’s this all about?”

Chapter 4

“You’re disobeying me now?” he repeated.

Scott’s voice snapped at my ear like a whip. His eyes were wide with disbelief, the kind that made me want to laugh if I wasn’t so exhausted.

“No,” I said, my throat raw. “I’m just tired. I got hurt, Scott. Didn’t I call you?”

His expression flickered — the mask slipping back into place, the apologetic husband, the sweet savior he liked to play for everyone else’s benefit.

“Oh, baby, I thought you were joking,” he crooned, stepping forward, brushing a hand down my cheek as if that would wipe away the bruises I still felt on my ribs.

“Why didn’t you tell me again? Where are you hurt? We’ll find who did this to you, huh? They’ll pay. You should lie down. I’ll take care of you—”

A sharp scream cut through the corridor.

“Help! Scott!” Jasmine’s voice — sharp, desperate.

I didn’t even get to feel what betrayal tasted like because Scott didn’t spare me another glance. He spun on his heel like I wasn’t even there. “Jasmine! I’m here! I’m coming!” I heard him shout as he disappeared into her room.

All I could do was stand there, staring at the empty space where he’d just been. Then I laughed. A bitter sound, more air than humor. I didn’t know whether I was laughing at him or myself anymore.

From the room, I could hear him: “It’s okay, Jasmine, I’m here. I’ll call the doctor, don’t worry.” Then, loud enough for the whole hallway to hear: “Nadine! Call the doctor!”

Like I was a maid. Like I wasn’t the woman who’d wasted years pretending to be his wife. I turned to walk away but Jasmine’s weak, syrupy voice called out, “Nadine! Wait, please come here!”

Before I knew it, I was at her bedside, staring down at her delicate, porcelain-doll face, the one that had always won people over so easily.

“Oh, my best friend,” she sighed dramatically. “I missed you so much. Scott told me everything, about how you’ve been taking care of me, and my brother, the house… thank you. Thank you for everything you’ve done while I was gone… and now I’m here.”

The words tasted rotten.

My hand moved before my brain could stop it. I pushed her shoulder — not hard, but enough for her to stumble back against the pillows.

She drew in sharp breath. “Sister… what did I do? Why did you push me?” She looked at Scott, wide-eyed.

“What the heck is wrong with you?” Scott rounded on me, fury making his neck flush red. “Didn’t you see she’s still weak? She could’ve fallen! She’s hurt!”

I laughed dryly. “I’m hurt too, remember? Or did you forget? I didn’t push her. She pressed against me. It hurts.”

Scott’s eyes narrowed. “You can’t even say sorry nicely? Jasmine’s always been good to you—”

“Scott, don’t say that to my best friend,” Jasmine cut in with her soft, trembling voice, tears brimming like an actress on cue. “I didn’t know she was hurt. Nadine, I’m so sorry. Please, forgive me.”

Scott folded his arms, the decision made. “Apologize to her, Nadine.”

“No,” I whispered.

His eyes darkened. “Then you’re leaving me no choice. I’ll lock you up in our house until you learn how to respect your own family.”

I felt the laugh bubbling up but it came out as a scoff instead. I could see it so clearly now — how he had shown me his true face the moment Jasmine opened her eyes. I was nothing again. Less than nothing.

“Lock me up then,” I muttered. I looked him straight in the eye. “You never even cared that I lost our child.”

His face twisted, not understanding the last words I said. “What did you say?”

But I was already walking away. He never cared to follow because Jasmine told him to let me go… I was just mad and would be okay in a while.

Well, I would never be okay.

When I got home, I went straight to the little altar I’d built for my father — and now, my baby. I lit a candle for the child I’d never get to meet, my hand steady even as the tears blurred my vision.

The ping of my phone startled me. It was my mother: Everything will be prepared in three days. The helicopter will be waiting with your fiance. Come home.

I clutched the phone to my chest and nodded to no one but myself. Three more days. That was all I had to survive.

Hours later, Scott came back. He didn’t even glance at the candle burning for our child. Of course he didn’t. He just looked at me with that fake, exhausted smile, and said, “I’m sorry, baby. I overreacted earlier. Jasmine wants a banquet tomorrow. You’ll handle it, right?”

I laughed but it came out cracked and raw. “Tomorrow? That’s impossible.”

His smile vanished. “I’m not asking if you can do it. I’m telling you to do it.”

Jasmine appeared behind him, wrapping her frail arms around his body. “Scott, it’s okay… we can do it next week—”

“No. It has to be now,” Scott said. “Everyone must know you’re alive. They won’t dare touch you again.” His eyes cut to me. “Nadine will handle it.”

And that was that. They left me there — like a servant — to make call after call, pulling favors, arranging everything for the woman who’d ordered me dead.

I didn’t sleep that night. I didn’t dare. I worked until my fingers were raw, the candle at my father’s altar burning down to a stub.

Hours before dawn, I passed their bedroom. The door was ajar and the soft sound of wincing voices spilled into the hallway.

I stood there for a moment. I didn’t cry. There were no tears left for them.

I went to my room, pulled out the wedding gown I never wore. The ring he gave me and the copy of their marriage certificate. I dropped them in a box, along with a note about the baby he’d never cared to meet.

I scheduled the delivery for our wedding anniversary, no, their wedding anniversary — the same day I’d disappear forever.

When I finally drifted off, I barely heard Scott come in. He went straight for the vase my father made before he died — the last piece I had left.

“What are you doing?”

“I’ll have this. Jasmine wants it.”

“No,” I whispered. “Please, Scott, not that. That’s all I have left of my father. You know that! Why are you giving it to Jasmine?”

He didn’t even look at me. “Because she said she wants it and she'll give it to the doctor who had operated on her as a thank you because she was great now. It’s just a vase, Nadine. You have plenty.”

When I reached for it, he shoved me aside. I hit the floor, biting back a cry.

He never even looked back.

\--

The day of the banquet was almost beautiful, if you ignored the fact that I was nothing more than their well-dressed maid.

Jasmine lay on her chaise like a delicate queen, smiling sweetly at the guests who flocked to see the miracle — the perfect woman, alive after three years in a coma. Scott hovered by her side, his every gesture dripping devotion like poison I once used to drink willingly.

I moved through the ballroom with a tray in my hands, nodding, bowing, smiling as if none of it tore me apart inside.

When I brought Jasmine her wine, she clasped my wrist with her too-soft fingers. “Nadine, this is lovely. Truly, thank you for all this.” She tilted her head, her syrupy tone slipping like a knife under my ribs. “You know, your husband really loves me. Don’t you think?”

I said nothing.

She laughed lightly, as if it were the funniest thing in the world. “He did this for me — all of this. He’d do anything for me, you know. So, tell me… what are your plans for your wedding anniversary?” Her smile widened, crocodile-like. “I mean, is it really your anniversary?""

Of course, she knew. They had been fooling me since.

I stared right through her. “Don’t worry, I’m leaving so you can have fun with him during our anniversary,” I whispered.

She blinked, caught off guard for a second. But then her grin returned, wider than ever. “Good,” she said, her eyes cold. “Run away, then.”

I turned away before she could see the tremble in my hands. I stood behind the crowd for hours, watching them bask in the glow of my work.

Guests laughed, music flowed, Jasmine twirled around Scott like a silk ribbon and I wondered when I’d ever felt that wanted. Maybe never.

I have a 2.5-year-old and a 9-month-old who is currently teething hard (and possibly fighting off a bug he passed on to my husband). Oh, and I’m pregnant too.

So here’s my list of things that have traumatised me since becoming a mom. No particular order, just vibes.

• Hand, foot, and mouth disease. Enough said
• Projectile vomiting
• High fevers
• Crying that just won't stop
• Carrying a baby around for hours because sitting down is illegal 
• Hair pulling, more triggering than anything else 
• Getting smacked in the eye for no reason
• When they dig their toes into my thighs so they can push away
• Diaper changes with a baby who WILL NOT SIT STILL
  • Bonus: pooping 7 times a day with the worst diaper rash
• Postpartum depression, especially the neglect that can come with it

I can probably think of a few more, but my brain is mashed potatoes at the moment and I need another coffee just to feel alive. ",1,1753254307.0,Mommit,5,1.0,False

I talked with her for 2 months online (long distance) every day before I asked her to meet up.

I am usually socially anxious when meeting new people and trying new things, that’s why I never really wanted to try dating. And this girl is an absolute 10 in looks, outgoing, friendly, extroverted, so I went from level 1 to taking on level 100.

It started off ok, we hugged and found seats at the coffee bar, but after a little bit, since we talked so much online, I ran out of things to talk about. My mind was completely blank. Also she had random family members around us in the coffee bar which added even more pressure.

I couldn’t fill gaps with small talk since I already knew everything about her from talking online, I couldn’t really flirt since she had family members around (I’m also am not experienced with it), she’s extremely outgoing and extroverted but she wasn’t asking me any questions (she’s said she’s bad at asking questions in the past), and like 60% of the time we were just sitting there staring. We were at the coffee bar for almost damn 3 hours. I asked her if we can go on a walk hoping that would make things a little less boring and she says “Nah that’s not my thing”. At the end, when we were leaving I tried to do a hug but since everyone was watching I messed it up and did a weird awkward side hug.

Now I’m so embarrassed about myself and I don’t want to go on another date again because I’m just so awkward.

1m722ei,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m722ei,I took my newly overhauled X61s to coffee - with the ultra rare 8 cell FLAT bottom Reserve Edition battery (42T5260)!,"It's me back with another battery rebuild - this time the very rare 42T5260 ThinkPad Reserve Edition battery, 8 cell with a flat bottom! I saw a post a few years ago from a Reserve Edition owner asking for battery replacements! I don't have a Reserve Edition, but I acquired a regular X61s and overhauled it for testing purposes. Like the 4 cell flat bottom, this battery only fits on the X6xs, it's wider than a regular 8 cell battery! And as the few Reserve Edition owners found out, only this battery is a perfect fit on those machines due to the latching of the leather casing!

As for the X61s, I got rid of its crappy aluminium coldplate heatsink for a copper variant to facilitate the FSB overclocking!

The battery is very difficult to get hands on, but I stumbled across a seller in China was selling both this and the 4 cell flat version.

The construction of this battery is very similar to the X6xT and X20xT batteries, 4 cell 18650, 4 cell prismatic 103450. Dealing with the BQ8030 stuff and the attachment of the cells are also very similar to the 12++ X200T battery I dealt with last time.

This time I used Molicel ICP103450CA, brand new stock dated in 2023, and turns out the chemistry for these much closer matched the original Sanyos, and hence worked a LOT better than the Panasonic NCA103450, despite being cheaper! Right now this battery lasts slightly more than its design caapcity, at 68Wh/66Wh design!

Even though the X61s can use a lot of other batteries, many much easier to find, only this battery managed to show the true slimness of the X61s, managing to sit flush without propping the laptop up, all while still carrying a nicely usable capacity!",28,1753252725.0,thinkpad,1,1.0,False
1m7228v,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity_help/comments/1m7228v/messages_sent_from_friend_that_she_swears_she/,Messages sent from friend that she swears she never sent,"I have an odd situation that I'd really like to get some outside perspective on, because I'm at a loss. Here's the story:

Over the past eight months, I (adult male) have developed a close, but platonic, relationship with a woman (adult female) at work. We are both married to other partners. We get along really well and chat pretty frequently, nearly every day. We chat primarily on Discord, and this is where it starts getting weird.

We hung out one night with our other friends and ended up dancing at a bar and everyone got home pretty late. I DM'd her at the end of the night saying ""hey, thank you for coming out tonight, that was fun!"". The next morning, I receive a DM back from her saying ""kiss me"". The message was clear as day on my phone notification pop-up. So I go into Discord and I see the message for a second and then it disappears, as if it was deleted. It was a weird for multiple reasons.

1. We were not close in that way, and we were both clear in our intentions to keep it that way.
2. It didn't sound like anything she'd ever say or even do (very out of character).
3. The message came through a bit earlier on weekend than when she normally would message.

I leave it since I was in middle of a project, but then she starts texting back closer to her ""normal"" time in the morning. When I confront her about it, she is mortified and swears up and down that she would never do such a thing. Which I of course believe, because it didn't make any sense. I tried to gently ask her if anyone else has access to her machines, but she said no one that would ever do such a thing.

I then recommend to her that she log out of all devices in the app, change her password, and turn on two-factor authentication, which she does. I also tell her to uninstall any browser plugins on her desktop,  in case something was scraping login tokens or whatnot (I was reaching for an explanation at this point). I actually went ahead and did the same, seeing that I didn't yet have 2FA myself.

So all goes well for a while (a month or so), and I end up going through a lot of stressful happenings in my life, so when she reaches out one afternoon I am more quiet than normal and let her know I just need some space for a bit. She graciously understands, and the day progresses. Suddenly I get a message that says ""wtf"" late into the evening and then it promptly deletes itself. I ask her about that and she is understandably upset as am I, since this now feels like a clear violation of privacy going on (also I never seen her ever use the expression 'wtf' before in any of our chats). Of course, we both have 2FA enabled and there were no suspicious devices in our logged in machines, so there was no smoking gun there. She also said she hadn't been on Discord at all. 

A half hour later, a new message comes in from her in my notifications that says ""i just want to be with you and I cant. Im sorry"". Again, it shows up for a second when I open the client and disappears a second later. The writing style doesn’t match hers so I already know it's not her. Also, I have noticed that on phones, the first letter is usually auto-capitalized, but not on the PC, and primarily uses mobile, but who knows. So I share this with her and we are even both more understandably upset and feeling like our privacy has been violated yet again. Following this, she once again changes her password, and formats the desktop PC she was using that had the Discord client. She has since not installed Discord on any PC since then, and uses mobile exclusively. 

We haven't seen any of these messages in the last month, but being shaken, we honestly haven't talked much or as openly about things, since we don't know how or why these messages appeared like they have. 

Another interesting note is that last week, I went to send a message to a friend in Instagram and noticed that in my message history, her profile picture was suddenly all black, instead of a normal profile picture. I clicked on it and it said the account was private, or something of that nature, there was little information. I thought that was odd and asked her if she blocked me in DM. She was, of course, incredulous and said that she had not done that and that she was going to change her Instagram password right then and there. From what I could see, this blocking had only happened to me, and no other friends.

That's the story so far, and hopefully I've included enough detail for you to draw a theory from. What do you think was happening here? 

Do you think it was a rogue hacker that swiped an access token while she was surfing on coffee shop WiFi and being creepy? If so, how did the same person retain access after the changed password and addition of 2FA? Potentially had access through another vector on her PC and so it didn't matter what she did if she logged in on the machine? There is some sense to that, especially given the odd spelling and punctuation usage. But why did the messages delete right after? Did the attacker do that, or does Discord validate messages and was throwing out ""invalid"" messages when it detected it was not genuine? (I'm reaching here, I know). Of course, why is our chat the only chat this person is engaged with? I tried to search the internet for anyone else who had experienced something like this, but I came up empty-handed. 

Or do you think the answer is simpler, and it was more likely someone who has physical access to her devices? Based on my limited understanding (I have not pressed this issue with her), the only person in the vicinity to her devices was her husband, and she vehemently swears he would never do anything remotely like that.  It would also be relatively easy to manipulate Instagram and block people with direct access to a logged in device. I unfortunately don't check Instagram often, so I had no idea when that happened, so I can't pinpoint timing. 

Is there an angle I haven't considered? The odd happenings have strained our friendship, and if was someone's intent to distance us, it's making an impact.

  
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

\- I should add that she has confided in me that her husband has expressed some level jealously with her regarding how close we are.

1m720kk,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1m720kk/revenge_too_long_i_have_suffered/,Revenge... too long I have suffered,"My upstairs neighbor moved in last November and it's been an ordeal since day one. Noise of footsteps echoing on my ceiling, cannabis smoker making a stink (I live in France it's illegal in our country) the building when the mood strikes, drags furniture every day since moving in 9 months ago and since I asked the rental agency to reframe it there must be noise at night. She is deceitful so she manages to make noise once every 30 minutes to 1 hour so that I cannot have it noticed by the police. That night I was woken up 3 times and from 3am the noise stopped but my night was ruined. 

She also does nasty things to me like throwing coffee on my kitchen shutter, her boyfriend insulted me 15 days ago behind the door of their apartment when I was leaving my house, and I suffered water damage this Monday at 5 a.m. because she didn't close her window during the storm. She didn't bother to open the door when I knocked at her house to be sure that it really came from the rain that came into her house and not from another water leak like a pipe or something else. As a result I have a 5-6 centimeter crack in the ceiling in the place affected by the water, she could have destroyed my TV which is right there if I hadn't had the Basin reflex and above all she does not take responsibility for her acts of negligence and lies to the agency by saying that she was sleeping when I came to knock while I heard the sound of her footsteps 5 minutes before going up to her house.

In short, she clearly doesn't care about me and there is no way I can remain patient any longer with a crazy person like that who is ruining my life. Give me ideas for revenge without being blameworthy of course, I want to be as deceitful as her and still send her a message while waiting to have accumulated enough evidence against her to file a complaint.

\*\*\*

Six months ago, I was cooked. And not in the “sun-kissed by the beach” way. More like overcaffeinated, under-rested, and emotionally toasted. My brain felt like a tangled pile of extension cords and my body was constantly asking, “Why are we doing this again?” I needed a reset, but didn’t want to do another juice cleanse or meditate in a corner while my to-do list laughed at me.



Then I came across Sun Home Saunas. At first, I was like, “A sauna? In my house? Who do I think I am?” But then I saw the setup: clean lines, smart features, infrared tech, actual health benefits. Suddenly, my inner wellness goddess was screaming YES! I clicked around, read the science, watched a video, and decided to go for it. If I was going to keep grinding, I needed a serious reboot button.



Now? It’s my holy space. My heat box of sanity. My daily detox and escape. I step in stressed and step out feeling like I just got hugged by a thousand eucalyptus-scented clouds. The muscle soreness melts. The mental clutter clears. I sweat out all the nonsense and somehow, everything feels a little more possible.



What’s wild is how quietly it changed everything. I didn’t have to overhaul my life. I just carved out 20 minutes a day to sit in a beautiful wooden box and breathe. My skin’s clearer, my sleep’s deeper, my energy isn’t just coming from coffee anymore, and my nervous system is no longer screaming into the void. I’m not saying I’ve transcended stress, but we definitely don’t hang out as much anymore.

(UK NHS),"Hi, hopefully I am in the right place I'm in my 30's and been fighting for a hysto since I suspected Endo it was finally confirmed this year with an MRI. My bmi is 56? I am 5'2 and weigh around 22 stone and have lost 3 stone on my own which the Gyno's refuse to acknowledge. I keep desperately trying to explain I am trying to loose weight but even if I have coffee instead of eating certain meals I only stay weight, the gyno's don't listen I feel like my hormones are preventing me from losing weight. 



I am afab trans and the gyno's have been more concerned with my transness and my CPTSD and trying to blame my trauma on my periods then actually treating me which is why I changed to Oxford who said I had to ""exhaust all forms of treatment"" to get a hysto because there is no funding. They even tried to push me to have a coil AGAIN even though I have already had one at 17 and it was the worst experience I had and it rejected and I bled so bad I couldn't go to college or work at the time. I legit said how many coils do you want me to try until you will be happy?   


I also have PCOS which I don't want either so want ovaries removed she said because of my weight they can't do keyhole. I explained my friends surgeon said for over weight people they can go through the ""bottom"" i.e the entrance and get everything out. She said they can't do that with the ovaries like I want and then said they can't do that if I haven't had a baby? I am so confused would having a baby make me wider down there I google searched all this and it said this was incorrect but if I fact check I get told I am wrong. I understand the internet is not always correct though.  
  
After an hour of arguing and pushing I felt defeated suicidal and agreed to menopause injection which in the end she admitted would mess me up before giving me oestrogen which she then offered. So it would be like a hysto at which point why not give me one? I guess because I would be at risk due to my weight? I have been under for wisdom teeth and yes I know the surgery is very different but I mean if they are concerned with general anaesthetic I was fine with that which I have pointed out. 

  
If my weight is relevant that is fine and I will quit I will take the horrible menopause drugs they want and give in. But my friend wants me to fight this and get in touch with an organisation to help fight my case. I am so tired so ill and so very sick of this. Oh and to top of this she wants me to go to a pain clinic and I saw on the letter she wrote ""some aspects of my pain are psychological"" I hate to be rude but wtf. 

Also one gyno told me to get the weight loss injection (I guess he didn't even know the names of them and put in a letter to go to my gp) I did that and I am not even entitled to it I been told by my GP I have to have the bmi I have and have like four of the medical conditions... so I just feel like crap.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Friends and fellow travellers,

How is that self love thing going? Many of us accumulated quite some self loathing or just general misery during our drinking days, and many of us are still stuck in behaviour and thoughts and patterns that tear us down, rather than build us up. So, showing some self love, showing that you’re actually worthy of good, is important.

It’s early morning here (considering it’s mid staycation), I just brewed a fresh pot of coffee and now I’m going to take a walkabout in the garden. Just to breathe. That’s self love right here, right now. Baths. Timeouts. Letting go of grievances. Oh and we’re going to see the new Marvel movie tonight - I introduced my son to Star Wars and Marvel through the years, and now he’s taking me! I love that. Grown ass man allowing himself being treated by his student kid.
