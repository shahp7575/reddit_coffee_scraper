**Preface**

Dreams weave an intricate tapestry in the fabric of our lives, embracing a spectrum of experiences. From blissful reveries to Deja Vu, unsettling nightmares, and terrifying visions, these night terrors unfold during a specific nocturnal phase, dissipating with the first light of dawn. The term ""nightmare"" finds its roots in Old English, where ""mare"" signifies a mythic demon or goblin inflicting terror through haunting dreams. These unsettling occurrences are commonly known as nightmares or night terrors. They emerge during REM sleep, characterized by heightened brain activity, accelerated breathing, increased heart rate, and rapid eye movement beneath closed lids. The limbs experience temporary immobility.

Nightmares are believed to exert a more profound impact on infants and children, their souls still untainted and capable of tethering to the spirit world during slumber. These delicate connections persist in their nascent state, opening pathways for encounters with demons, malevolent spirits, or goblins seeking ingress from the underworld through these disquieting dreams. Myriad tales recount human interactions with ghosts, spirits, demons, and bogeys.

These supernatural entities have traversed the eons, and numerous unexplained phenomena have been attributed to their paranormal presence. Religions across the globe afford them a reverent status, aligning them with deities. In every religious doctrine, spirits—be they sacred or profane—hold a pivotal role. Some religions even assign specific deities to preside over the spirit realm. This ethereal domain is commonly referred to as the Underworld.

 **\*\*Chapter 1: The Terror Nights\*\***

A harrowing journey of Shilpa, a pregnant woman, as she grapples with nightly terrors and the perils of her day-to-day life.

**Chapter-1 The Terrors Nights**

 On a lonely night, a narrow, tedious and desolate road had stretched amidst towering trees, their branches casting eerie shadows below. A celestial blue moon hung prominently in the sky, illuminating the surroundings with its radiant glow, casting a silvery sheen on the path below. The distant howls of dogs from a nearby cemetery, accentuated an eerie atmosphere. Along this isolated road, a pregnant woman, clad in a vivid red Jegging paired with a yellow top and flat slip-ons, hurriedly ran down the eerie path. With swift pace combined with her glances over her shoulder looking behind her trying her best to escape from the unseen pursuer, an ominous presence that was looming in the shadows.

Racing through the sinister path, her legs straining against the pursuiter which sought to engulf her. Her every step echoed the palpable tension in the air. Beads of sweat glistened on her forehead ran down her cheeks, and the rhythm of her breath matched the urgency the escape. Fighting against her fatigue, she pressed on, with one hand cradling her burgeoning belly—a vivid symbol of impending motherhood. The demanding run and the weight of her pregnancy became an intricate challenge of her decision to escape the menace. Frantically yearning to escape, she continued to sprint away from the imperceptible malevolence tailing her. The sinisterly shadowy bluish ethereal hands, devoid of any tangible form crafted from smoke and light, emerging from a murky wisp of cloud from surrounding shadows, that was suspended in the air, these eerie hands possessed a translucent essence that cast an otherworldly glow under the moonlight. They reached out from every direction in an attempt to ensnare her. It relentlessly pursued her, and swiftly and steadily it was closing the distance on her.

But she sprinted onward, undauntedly she pressed on, skilfully evading the spectral hands through agile jumps and nimble escapes. Yet, the relentless pursuit exacted its toll. Fatigue set in, exacerbated by her nearing proximity to the cemetery. Her breaths became desperate, and an unquenchable thirst gripped her.

Fatigue set in as she approached the cemetery. Her breaths becoming laboured. Thirst set in, and panting heavily, she struggled to fill her lungs with air. Despite her best efforts, her body resisted, her heart racing and blood pressure rising. The relentless pursuit had become an exhausting ordeal, with the haunting hands an ever-present menace an unsettling presence in the dimly lit night.

Struggling for breath, she opened her mouth wide in a desperate attempt to gasp for air just before her body succumbed. As her eyes closed, a dark wisp of cloud pounced and enveloped her. She could not breathe anymore, the oppressive weight on her chest was unbearable, and she blacked out. 

With a sudden gasp of breath, Shilpa was violently pulled from the clutches of her terrifying dream. She sat upright on the bed, her chest rising and falling rapidly as she desperately gasped for air. At five months of pregnancy, she gripped her belly. The weight of the nightmare lingered in the dimly lit room. Beads of sweat glistened on her forehead as she tried to shake off the residual fear. Shilpa's sister, who shared the room with her, woke up startled by the incessant panting and gasping of her sibling. Shilpa wore a terrified expression on her face, and soon after, tears streamed down her cheeks.

""Calm down, sis... it's just one of your nightmares!"" Namrata said, attempting to comfort Shilpa.

Shilpa, happily married to Jacob, exuded a timeless beauty. She fell in love with Jacob who was working with her in a software firm. Her moderate height, fair complexion, and long, graceful face embodied elegance. A slender figure and long fingers added to her poise. With shoulder-length hair framing her face, brown eyes, and a slender nose, she possessed remarkable beauty, outshining even her college-going sister. Having experienced a normal life with a pleasant childhood and teenage years, Shilpa was kind in nature.

Shilpa embarked on her professional journey right after completing her graduation. She crossed paths with Jacob during an office trip. Jacob, a tall and slender man in his late 20s, radiated charm and handsomeness. Shilpa's fearless and adventurous spirit created a strong bond with the like-minded Jacob. They shared many adventurous excursions such as hiking, trekking, and kayaking. Their connection deepened during one particular office trip to a place renowned for its forests, coffee estates, and scenic landscapes.

Jacob first met Shilpa during an adventurous office trip. He intercepted her fall, grasping her as she momentarily lost her footing while dismounting from the zip line and saved her. Their initial connection grew into a deep bond, yet they kept their romantic feelings hidden for the next six months. While enjoying regular coffee outings and adventurous trips together, they maintained the pretence of being just friends. It was only when a near accident jolted Jacob's emotions that he recognized the depth of his feelings for Shilpa. In that crucial moment, his thoughts turned immediately to her, prompting him to confront the love that had silently developed between them.

Jacob wasted no time in professing his love, proposing to Shilpa the very next day after the incident. Shilpa who was also equally smitten by Jacob’s charm, found his thoughts consuming her every time she closed her eyes. Without a moment's hesitation, she accepted his proposal. At the age of 28, they tied the knot, with Shilpa being 25 at the time. The couple enjoyed a blissful marriage, and a year into their journey together, they joyfully decided to expand their family. Shilpa, now pregnant with their child, followed the tradition of delivering her firstborn at her mother's house. However, the journey of this pregnancy presented various challenges, beginning with her declining health.

In the early stages, the complications were attributed to pregnancy-related issues. Shilpa grappled with agonizing headaches and, at times, alarming episodes of excessive bleeding. There were moments when she feared the loss of her child, but thankfully, such fears remained unfounded. An eerie feeling of being watched persisted. Uncertain whether it was the watchful gaze of a divine entity or a spectral presence, Shilpa chose to seek comfort in the company of her mother during these trying times. From the onset of her pregnancy, an uncanny feeling of being observed and followed had unnerved her. Every shadow and flicker of light made her jumpy, easily spooked by the slightest hint of the supernatural. Shilpa guarded these haunting experiences in her shroud of silence!

As the clock struck 5 AM, a tranquil calm enveloped Shilpa, allowing her to reclaim composure and drift back into the solace of much-needed sleep. Namrata, too, embraced the tapestry of slumber, casting aside the lingering remnants of the unsettling night. The sunlit rays heralded their awakening at 7 AM, ushering in a new day that seemed untouched by the spectral events of the past hours. These haunting nightmares had woven themselves into the fabric of Shilpa's nightly routine, casting an enduring shadow over her rest. With a contemplative mind, Shilpa approached her bed late at night, seeking refuge in weariness, hoping it would pave the way for a tranquil slumber. Before long, the soothing embrace of sleep cocooned her, offering a fleeting escape from the ethereal tapestry that unfurled within the realms of her dreams.

Thud… Thud...''—a rhythmic sound of someone banging on the wall filled the room. In her drowsy state, Shilpa struggled to open her eyes. With great difficulty she opened her eyes and managed to focus on the source of the banging sound. Through her hazy vision, she could a make out a blurry image of a male standing by the wall near the bedroom door, repeatedly banging his head against it. Rubbing her eyes to clear the blur, what she saw next shocked her, it was Jacob engaging in this unsettling behaviour.

“Jacob…” she screamed, bolting out of bed and rushing towards him. “What happened, Jacob?” she asked, pulling him away from the wall. He remained unresponsive, persistently banging his head. Shilpa tried to hold him back. “Jake, stop it! What’s wrong with you? Why are you doing this?” Shilpa questioned, exerting all her strength to prevent him from harming himself. Still unresponsive, she forcefully brought him down to the floor.

Jacob and Shilpa tumbled to the floor, and Shilpa maintained her tight grip on him. Jacob's demeanour seemed possessed; his eyes emitted an eerie blue glow, and his complexion had turned ghostly pale. Despite fear creeping through Shilpa, her determination compelled her to clutch onto him. Closing her eyes firmly, she fervently prayed for intervention. Suddenly, a creaking noise emanated from the room. Slowly reopening her eyes to investigate, Shilpa noticed the door slightly ajar, revealing the corridor bathed in a mysterious dim blue light. Puzzled, she wondered who had opened the door.

“How did it open?!... Did her sister or mom open the door? Or was it the wind?” she thought to herself without realizing that Jacob was no longer struggling to break free. She could see a shadow in the corridor approaching her room, but she couldn't make out whose it was.

“Mom…” she called out. “Namrata!” she shouted, waiting for any response, but none came. She could see the shadow coming closer to the door, and it was moving fast. Scared, she thought, ‘Was it burglars?!’ She was sweating, but she kept holding down Jacob. Out of fear, she tried to hide behind him and didn't let him go. The shadow came near the door and stopped. Shilpa kept staring at the door, fearing what might happen next. Her fears came true; something did come inside.

It was not burglars, but a black figure with long slender hands and legs that walked like a spider. It had no face. The figure entered the room swiftly and pounced on her. Shilpa wanted to cover and escape from it but could not. She felt a heavy weight on her chest and was unable to breathe; she screamed for help. Screaming loudly, Shilpa woke up from her sleep, sweating and panting as if she had run a marathon. She lay on the floor panting with her eyes wide open, slowly turning towards the door where she remembered seeing Jacob but found no one was there.

It took Shilpa a moment to comprehend that she had experienced another one of her night terrors, and that she was on the floor. It was 4 in the morning. The sound of Shilpa falling off the bed stirred her sister from her sleep. Namrata swiftly got out of bed and aided Shilpa in getting up. Shilpa, still trembling, ascended from the floor. As she sat on the bed, she reached for water, and with a single breath, drained the entire glass.

“Again you had one of your nightmares, isn't it?’ Enquired Namrata.

""Yes,"" Shilpa uttered, lying back on her bed and returning to sleep. Namrata, accustomed to Shilpa's nightmares, also settled back into sleep beside her sister. Shilpa had been experiencing nightmares since her college days, although they hadn't been as severe back then.

Despite Shilpa having nightmares in the past, it hadn't significantly impacted her health. However, lately, the situation was worsening, and its toll on her well-being was becoming apparent. The eerie sensation that something was trailing her intensified in Shilpa. What were once rare occurrences had become more frequent, a constant presence that haunted her daily life. Despite her efforts to ignore it, the strange feeling grew stronger with each passing day. A week had elapsed, and the nightmares persisted, casting a shadow over her every night.

That night, Shilpa awoke startled, frightened by a recurring nightmare where the same eerie creature had pounced on her. Thirsty and uneasy, she rose to fetch water, only to realize there was no bottle beside her bed. Wondering why she had forgotten, she left her room, heading toward the kitchen. Passing the drawing-room, a fleeting impression of someone sitting on the sofa caught her eye, but she dismissed it as a figment of her imagination. In the kitchen, she opened the fridge, grabbed a cold-water bottle, and took a few refreshing sips in the hot summer night. The refrigerator door remained ajar, casting a soft light into the room.

Shilpa had gulped couple of sips when she noticed a figure standing next to the fridge. The figure remained partially obscured, as the other side of the refrigerator was shrouded in darkness. Startled, Shilpa choked on the water, coughing it out in surprise. As she regained her composure, she glanced back at the spot where she had seen the figure, but it had vanished.

A cold shiver ran down Shilpa's spine, her body hair stood on end, and despite the hot weather, an unusual chill enveloped her. Perplexed, she questioned herself, ""Did I imagine that to this extent?"" The incident lingered in her mind, preventing her from a restful night's sleep. Doubts and fears swirled in her thoughts – was there something wrong with her, or was it the new house they recently moved into? Could she be possessed or experiencing a chemical imbalance in her head? Did someone cast black magic upon her? Countless questions haunted her mind, but answers remained elusive.

Sleep eluded her until 3 AM, and when she finally awoke the next day, it was late. Concerned for her well-being, her family allowed her the rest she seemingly needed, unaware of the unsettling experiences she faced. The sightings of mysterious figures persisted, occurring at any time of day or night, making her uneasy and jumpy. Only her sister noticed the change and decided to confront Shilpa about it.

""Sis! What's going on? Lately, you seem very restless, spooked, jumpy at every little movement around you!"" Shilpa didn't respond; she was unsure how to express herself. After persistent persuasions, she finally opened up about the strange occurrences. Her sister drew parallels with a past experience from college, suggesting they consult a priest like in the past. However, Shilpa hesitated, feeling this was different from witchcraft, perhaps related to pregnancy stress. The matter was deferred for a few more weeks. With no relief from the recurring dreams and sightings, Shilpa took a different route and confided not in her mom but in her doctor.

Shilpa sought counsel from her gynecologist, who, unsurprisingly, was not taken aback by her account. Such experiences were relatively common among first-time pregnant women, often attributed to a combination of anxiety, fear of childbirth, and hormonal fluctuations.

The doctor prescribed medication for anxiety, advising Shilpa to return if there was no improvement in three days. Trying the medication for two days, it initially seemed effective, but from the second evening onward, Shilpa's unease returned. She continued to experience the same jumpiness and sightings of strange figures for two more months, with each dream growing more intense and the appearance of inexplicable phenomena increasing.",1,1755857396.0,WritingHub,0,1.0,False

It’s basically a **digital version of the old paper stamp cards** (like “buy 5 coffees, get 1 free”). Nothing complicated — no cashback, no hidden reward points, no confusing balances.

👉 Just a **visible stamp card on your phone**:

* Each time you buy, the shop stamps your card with a QR scan.
* When it’s full, you get the free item or reward.
* You can see your progress at all times, just like a paper card.

On top of that:

* You can **discover nearby cafés, restaurants, salons, etc.** in the app.
* Some shops might promote their offers on a map view.
* Optional notifications if you’re near a deal.

The idea is to make it super **simple and familiar** for both customers and small businesses — no special machines or complicated systems, just phones.

💬 Curious what you all think:

* Would you actually use this instead of carrying paper loyalty cards?
* Do you think local cafés/shops would sign up?
* What would make you download and keep using an app like this?",1,1755857334.0,loyaltymarketing,0,1.0,False

By Amy Lv and Ernest Scheyder

BEIJING/HOUSTON (Reuters) -The sharp jump in China’s imports of rare earth ore from the United States in July was probably the final customs accounting of shipments from U.S. supplier MP Materials.

Data on Wednesday from the General Administration of Customs showed imports of rare earths ore from the U.S. surged to 4,719 metric tons in July after falling to zero in June, sparking market speculation over the source of the shipments.

MP Materials, which owns the only U.S. rare earth mine has long sent ore to China for its minority shareholder Shenghe Resources to process.

But MP said in April that it had stopped shipping the critical minerals to China as the U.S. and China clashed over import tariffs before ceasing them altogether in July after announcing the U.S. Department of Defence had invested in the company to effectively become the biggest shareholder.

MP told Reuters on Thursday that its final exports were sent in the second quarter and “shipments over water, warehousing and other factors can contribute to reporting delays.”

The jump coincided with a recovery in China’s exports of rare earth magnets, key to electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence sectors.

China’s rare earth magnet exports to the U.S. jumped by 75.5% from the month before to 619 tons, 4.8% higher than the same month in 2024, the customs data showed.

https://reddit.com/link/1mx2gpm/video/u2005e47ljkf1/player

BEIJING, Aug 22 (Reuters) - China, the world's dominant rare earth supplier, issued on Friday measures to regulate the mining, smelting and separation of the critical minerals key to energy transition, further tightening its grip over supply.Beijing already regulates and manages rare earth mining, smelting and separation via a quota system. The new rules will include imported raw materials in that quota system, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said in a statement, following a [public consultation](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-proposes-new-rules-tighten-control-over-rare-earth-sector-2025-02-19/) process that began in February.

China is increasingly sensitive about rare earths and its [control](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-china-tightened-its-grip-over-its-rare-earth-sector-2025-07-07/) over supply, adding several rare earth items and magnets to its [export restriction](https://www.reuters.com/world/china-hits-back-us-tariffs-with-rare-earth-export-controls-2025-04-04/) list in April in retaliation for U.S. tariff hikes.

Aug 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. is seeking to procure cobalt worth up to $500 million for defense stockpiles amid the country's move to boost its critical mineral supplies. Companies have been scrambling to source rare earths after China imposed restrictions, leading to a 75% drop in rare earth magnet exports from the country in June and causing some auto companies to suspend production.

U.S. President Donald Trump in March invoked emergency powers to boost domestic production of critical minerals as part of a broad effort to offset China's near-total control of the sector.

In July, [Reuters reported](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-taps-mining-expert-head-national-security-office-sources-say-2025-07-23/) that the White House tapped a former mining executive, David Copley, to head an office at the National Security Council focused on strengthening supply chains. According to the tender document published by the U.S. Department of Defense and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) on Wednesday, they are looking for offers for alloy-grade cobalt of about 7,480 tonnes over the next five years. Cobalt, mostly imported by the U.S., is used in batteries, a component in nickel superalloys for high temperature sections of jet engines and industrial gas turbines, among others. However, the defense department was seeking offers from only three companies - units of Vale SA in Canada, Japan's Sumitomo Metal Mining and Norway's Glencore Nikkelverk.

**The document also said the purchase amount can range from between $2 million and $500 million in the five-year period.**

Picture this: a material that zips protons and electrons around at 200–500 °C as smoothly as cars on a freeway, chopping both cost and complexity for next-gen **hydrogen fuel cells** and membranes. Sounds like sci-fi, right? But researchers at [**Tohoku University**](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/press/new_material_may_enable_nextgen_hydrogen_energy_devices.html) have made it real with a **niobium-doped TiO2** mixed conductor—a breakthrough that could give **sustainable energy** and **fuel cell technology** a serious boost.

Assistant Professor **Tomoyuki Yamasaki** and Professor **Takahisa Omata** from the Institute of Multidisciplinary Research for Advanced Materials (IMRAM) proved that you can dope titanium dioxide with niobium and end up with a superstar mixed conductor. Basically, by introducing niobium as an electron donor inside the TiO2 lattice, the material pulls off double duty—transporting protons and electrons side by side at those cozy intermediate temperatures (200–500 °C). Believe it or not, this is the first time anyone’s shown that a simple oxide can carry both charge carriers via electron-donor doping.

Their findings, published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, reveal that Nb-doped TiO2 delivers proton conductivity rivaling specialized electrolytes while packing sturdy electronic conductivity. They even used a clever proton-conducting, electron-blocking glass electrolyte to confirm the magic.

This hub stringing together universities, startups, and industry is a key player in Japan’s Basic Hydrogen Strategy, driving forward **industrial decarbonization** across power, transport, and manufacturing.

# Technical aspects

Here’s the geeky bit: niobium donors crank up the electron count in the TiO2 matrix, which in turn stabilizes protons, loosens their grip, and speeds up diffusion. That dual-conduction trick means you can ditch separate electrodes and electrolytes, streamline device design, and get better heat control—huge wins for **hydrogen storage** and separation systems.

# Key Takeaways

* First-ever use of electron-donor doping to achieve mixed proton-electron conduction
* Smooth operation at 200–500 °C eases thermal stress
* Plays nice with established ceramic manufacturing methods
* Peer-reviewed and validated in the Journal of the American Chemical Society

# Business & Strategic Angle

Running at lower temps means lighter insulation and a smaller balance-of-plant, which slashes total system costs. Plus, Nb-doped TiO2 leans on abundant, low-cost raw materials—no pricey palladium or niche ceramics required. Talk is already swirling about licensing deals with membrane makers and slotting this tech into pilot-scale fuel cell stacks, all in step with the global rush toward zero-emission solutions.

Until now, you needed north of 500 °C to get the conductivity you want, locking these setups into massive industrial plants. This innovation closes that gap, opening doors for tough-as-nails, mid-temp fuel cells and hydrogen separation membranes in everything from off-grid micro-grids to backup generators.

Traditional silica or palladium-based membranes either demand oven-like heat or cost an arm and a leg (we’re talking thousands of dollars per square meter). Nb-doped TiO2 hits the sweet spot: solid performance in a manageable temperature range, all without exotic feedstocks.

# Perspective & Analysis

We might be staring down a true game-changer. Short term, demo units using Nb-doped TiO2 in membrane separators could deliver cleaner hydrogen production. Looking further out, slipping this material into fuel cells could spawn fresh business models—think portable generators, home combined heat and power, or even hydrogen-fueled drones.

From the lab’s corner, this proof-of-concept sparks big questions: what other oxides could we tune for mixed conduction? And how will they hold up after thousands of cycles? You can bet the next wave of materials research will riff on this dual-doping approach, building out versatile components across the hydrogen value chain.

Nb-doped TiO2 mixed conductors aren’t poised to knock out every incumbent overnight, but they’ve definitely narrowed the gap between the lab bench and the real world. As teams race to scale up and tackle real-world testing, this innovation could become a cornerstone of cost-efficient, intermediate-temperature **fuel cell technology**. **Keep your eyes peeled for pilot projects soon.**

# What’s Happening with the CHIPS Act Funding?

* On **August 21, 2025**, Reuters reported that the Trump administration is **considering reallocating at least $2 billion** from the CHIPS and Science Act—originally intended for semiconductor research and chip manufacturing—to support **critical minerals projects**.
* The plan aims to **centralize decision-making under Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick**, especially after confusion surrounding a previous Pentagon investment in rare-earths firm MP Materials.
* **These funds could be deployed via grants or equity stakes, though the specifics remain undecided.**

# Why This Matters for NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project

NioCorp’s vision positions it as a **strategic multi-mineral supplier**—not just of rare earths for magnets but also **scandium, niobium, and titanium**—all critical for defense, aerospace, and clean energy.

**Here’s how the potential CHIPS Act fund shift could support NioCorp:**

|Aspect|Relevance to NioCorp|
|:-|:-|
|**Grant/EQ Funding**|NioCorp may be eligible for federal backing via grants or equity investments, particularly under a push to shore up domestic critical minerals.|
|**Strategic National Significance**|As a vertically integrated, DFARS-compliant, U.S.-owned project, NioCorp aligns strongly with national security and supply chain resilience goals.|
|**Mature Permitting & Near-Term Output**|With infill drilling completed August 2025 and a Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) expected in Q4 2025, NioCorp’s timeline dovetails neatly with government funding flows.|
|**Competitive Positioning**|Amid growing competition in domestic critical minerals, access to CHIPS-derived funding could accelerate Elk Creek’s progress toward 2028 production goals.|

# ~NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project: At the Center of a Multi-Layered Strategic Convergence~

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project is now advancing through a powerful convergence of **project execution**, **national policy alignment**, and **capital market readiness** — positioning it as one of the most consequential U.S. critical minerals developments in decades.

With **Phase 1 infill drilling completed** and a **resource update imminent**, NioCorp enters a decisive stretch ahead of its **Q4 2025 Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS)**. The recent appointment of **Ernest Cleave** as CFO — a veteran in business development and strategic financing — underscores the company’s intent to capitalize on its near-term milestones.

# Now, geopolitical and policy catalysts are compounding:

* The Trump administration is reportedly weighing a **$2 billion reallocation** from the **CHIPS and Science Act** to fund **U.S. critical mineral projects** — an unprecedented move that could directly benefit projects like Elk Creek. The plan would prioritize **domestic production of defense- and energy-relevant metals**, aligning perfectly with NioCorp’s output of **Scandium, Niobium, Titanium, and Rare Earth Elements (REEs)**.
* NioCorp is already one of the **most policy-aligned mineral projects in the U.S.**, having secured:
   * A **$10 million DoD Title III award**
   * Active **EXIM Bank engagement for project financing**
   * Embedded roles in national lab qualification programs and defense-linked supply chain initiatives (e.g. **Project Pivot**)
* These federal alignments are strengthened by broader macro trends — including **reshoring mandates**, **tariff realignments**, and growing concern over **Chinese dominance** in global critical mineral supply chains.

Meanwhile, the current “quiet period” between drill completion and results has created a **catalyst vacuum** — an opportunity for institutional positioning ahead of value-unlocking announcements. With NioCorp’s tight float and scarcity value, such lulls are often **used by high-conviction investors to accumulate ahead of inflection points**.

Importantly, while an **anchor strategic or institutional investor** has not yet been publicly named, all indicators suggest interest from major players — especially given Elk Creek’s potential to supply **four critical inputs** across aerospace, defense, EVs, and clean tech. Post-DFS, the door opens for potential investment or offtake from:

* **Defense OEMs** like Boeing, Lockheed, or Northrop Grumman
* **Auto majors** like Stellantis or Ford (interested in scandium-aluminum alloys)
* **U.S. government agencies** (DoD, DOE, EXIM), especially under the proposed $2B CHIPS realignment

**Should any of these groups step in with anchor capital, it would validate the project's valuation and rapidly unlock further institutional and sovereign backing.**

With global demand intensifying for the exact materials Elk Creek is designed to produce — and a U.S. administration eager to deploy capital to strategic domestic projects — NioCorp is on the cusp of a re-rating. The next **4–6 months** could prove transformational, with milestones that include:

* **Resource model update/Drill Results**
* **Q4 DFS release**
* **Potential anchor investment**
* **Federal funding decisions tied to CHIPS reallocation**

# Bottom Line

***NioCorp is no longer simply a ""magnet metals"" story. It’s a multi-metal national security asset that sits at the intersection of resource security, policy urgency, and industrial innovation.***

***If execution matches trajectory, NioCorp could become a linchpin in U.S. material independence — and a potential beneficiary of billions in redirected federal funding aimed at reshaping America’s strategic supply chains.***

# — A game-changer for American Resource Independence by 2028 and beyond.

[Does Chime Really Help You Save Money Automatically?](https://preview.redd.it/ed70xojpojkf1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da9d151bec3201a80800f35fefc963368acb2203)

The short answer is yes—but how it works and whether it’s effective depends on your habits and goals. Chime, a popular online banking platform, has positioned itself as a money-saving tool designed for everyday people who want a hands-off approach to building financial security.

# How Chime’s Automatic Savings Features Work

Chime offers two main ways to help users save automatically:

1. **Round-Up Savings** – Every time you make a purchase with your Chime debit card, the transaction is rounded up to the nearest dollar. The difference is then transferred directly into your Chime savings account. For example, if you spend $4.40 on coffee, Chime will round it up to $5.00 and move the extra $0.60 into your savings.
2. **Automatic Transfers from Direct Deposit** – You can choose to have a percentage of your paycheck automatically transferred into your savings account. This “set it and forget it” method ensures that you save consistently every time you get paid.

These features might sound small, but they add up over time—especially for people who have trouble saving on their own.

# Does It Actually Work for Most People?

So, does Chime really help you save money automatically in a meaningful way? The answer depends on your spending and income.

* **For Everyday Spenders** – If you use your debit card frequently, the round-up feature alone can build a surprising cushion over time.
* **For Regular Employees** – If you get paid through direct deposit, setting aside even 5–10% of your paycheck automatically helps grow your savings without you noticing the difference.
* **For Side Hustlers or Freelancers** – Chime can still work, but consistent direct deposits matter for predictable savings.

The key benefit is consistency. Even small amounts saved automatically can lead to long-term results.

# The Psychology Behind Automatic Saving

One reason Chime is effective is because it removes the decision-making process. Many people struggle to save because they feel the pinch when transferring money manually. Chime makes saving painless by moving small amounts behind the scenes. Over weeks and months, these savings build up without creating financial stress.

# Limitations You Should Know About

Of course, no system is perfect. While asking *“does Chime really help you save money automatically?”* it’s also important to note the drawbacks:

* **Small Savings if You Don’t Spend Much** – If you rarely use your debit card, round-ups won’t add much.
* **Not a Substitute for Bigger Financial Goals** – Chime helps you start saving, but it’s not a replacement for structured investments or retirement planning.
* **Requires Discipline to Leave the Money Alone** – Some users are tempted to move savings back into checking for spending, which cancels out the progress.

# Who Benefits the Most from Chime’s Savings Tools?

Chime is especially useful for:

* **Young adults and students** learning how to save.
* **People living paycheck to paycheck** who struggle to build an emergency fund.
* **Anyone who prefers automation** instead of manual budgeting.

It’s not a magic fix, but it can be a strong starting point for developing better saving habits.

# Final Thoughts

So, does Chime really help you save money automatically? The answer is yes—it’s effective for building small, consistent savings without extra effort. With features like round-ups and paycheck transfers, Chime makes saving simple, painless, and reliable. While it won’t replace long-term investment strategies, it’s a great tool for creating financial breathing room and forming solid saving habits.

If you’re looking for a way to grow your savings little by little without thinking too hard about it, Chime can be a game-changer.",1,1755857148.0,u_globalpvashop45,0,1.0,False

* **Chobani (Hamdi Ulukaya)**, built on loans, not VC. Hamdi maxed debt to scale a dairy plant because “Turkish yogurt” did not look like a billion-dollar market. it is now one of the most successful consumer goods stories of the last two decades.
* **Truebill -> Rocket Money (Mokhtarzada brothers)**, laughed off as “just another budgeting app.” It took years before serious capital came in, then a $1.2B sale. anyone writing a $100k check in the first couple rounds made life-changing returns.

* **Databricks (Ali Ghodsi)**, foundational AI and data infrastructure valued at $100B. Early rounds were mainstream Silicon Valley guys. no meaningful Muslim or community capital at inception, even though the founder is one of ours.

[Small note: I help write Dhow Dispatch, a free weekly on Muslim founders and operators.](https://preview.redd.it/8h5624ueojkf1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=66cd350595001520e8ba1e2e70f98022c7f3133e)



What ties these together: is at seed, none of them looked obvious. “**Too niche**,” “**too risky**,” or “**too cultural**.” The market mispriced them, and Muslim founders had to climb uphill to prove value.

**Meanwhile, at the grassroots:** Yemeni coffee went from a handful of shops to hundreds across the country in a few years, now in 20+ major cities with multiple brands expanding in parallel. Qahwah House alone grew from a single shop in 2017 (Dearborn, MI) to \~25 U.S. locations by mid-2025: an implied **\~50% compound annual growth rate** in store count over eight years.

**Halal fast food** isn’t one-off anymore. You’re seeing concepts go from 1 to 3 to 10 locations in about 12–18 months, several newer brands sitting in the 25–50 unit range, and category leaders like The Halal Guys spreading country-wide. They scaled from their first franchise in 2015 to its 100th restaurant by March 2022, operating in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., South Korea, and Indonesia, with 85 U.S. locations across 18 states.

**Modest fashion** moved from niche to mainstream ecommerce. Muslim spend on apparel and footwear is forecast to hit about **$428B** by 2027 (\~6.1% growth). On the operator side, Modanisa did roughly $75–86M in online sales in 2024, and in the U.S. Haute Hijab is estimated around $8M a year in revenue; pulling the category further mainstream.

*The common thread: each jumped from niche to widespread, with strong growth ahead.*

**Why now matters:**

* The ceiling just moved. Databricks at roughly 100B, Applied at 15B, Replit’s ARR surge, Rocket Money’s billion-plus exit, and Chobani’s expansion reset what “normal” looks like for Muslim-led companies.
* The founder bench is deeper than it has ever been. Alumni from these wins are spinning out and hiring. That is how new waves start.
* The proof is visible earlier. A wise man once said ""invest in what you see everyday"". If you wait for headlines, you are late. In Replit's case, the explosive growth of vibe coding was very evident.
* **Our capital is still arriving last. That gap has not closed. That is the part we control.**

**Questions for the sub:**

* What stopped you from backing or even championing a Muslim-owned brand earlier: comfort with real estate, not knowing who was raising, or needing more proof first?
* Founders and operators, what single thing would have moved you from 1 to 2 locations or from side-project to real launch: a landlord willing to take a chance, an intro to an investor, your first 200 preorders, or something else?
* If you were to set aside a small slice for private deals this year, where does your first dollar go and why (dev tools, defense, consumer, fintech)?
* Have you *personally* backed or helped a Muslim founder? What happened after?

Feels like we are sitting on a severely overlooked corner of the market that everyone else will eventually catch up to, so **why not us, and why not now**?

Would love to hear what you all are seeing on the ground in your city, and which one Muslim-owned brand/startup/shop deserves more attention right now.

1mx2cya,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthandlifetips/comments/1mx2cya/what_are_signs_of_bladder_problems/,What are signs of bladder problems?,"# You know what’s wild?

Most people can spot a headache, fever, or stomach ache without a second thought—but when it comes to bladder problems, they just brush it off like it’s nothing. That little urge to pee every few minutes? The slight burning you keep ignoring? Or that embarrassing moment when you leak while laughing? Yeah, those aren’t just “small issues.” They could be early signs your bladder is waving a big red flag.

And here’s the thing—bladder problems are **way more common than you think**. Millions of people across all age groups face them, but only a handful talk about it because, let’s be honest, it feels awkward. Nobody likes chatting about frequent bathroom trips over coffee. But keeping quiet can make it worse.

Now, when it comes to bladder health in Pune, one name that constantly comes up is [Dr. Sachin Patil](https://g.co/kgs/nHZr6sE), a leading [Urologist in Pune](https://g.co/kgs/nHZr6sE) at **AIMS Urology Hospital**. Day after day, he sees patients walking in with the same story: “Doctor, I thought it was nothing… but now it’s affecting my work, sleep, and even social life.” That’s where the conversation about recognizing signs early becomes super important.

**1. Common Signs of Bladder Problems You Should Watch For**

That bladder problems don’t just “happen overnight.” Your body keeps dropping hints—you just need to catch them. Here are some tell-tale signs:

* **Frequent urination** – If you’re running to the bathroom more than 8 times a day or waking up multiple times at night, something’s off.
* **Urgency and leaks** – That sudden, uncontrollable urge to pee that sometimes leads to accidents? Classic bladder issue.
* **Pain or burning** – A burning sensation while urinating is often linked to infections.
* **Blood in urine** – Even a small trace of blood is a warning sign and should *never* be ignored.
* **Difficulty starting or weak flow** – This could point to issues in the bladder muscles or even the prostate in men.
* **Incomplete emptying** – Ever feel like your bladder is still full even after peeing? That’s another red flag.

These signs might sound simple, but when ignored, they can lead to infections, kidney damage, or serious conditions like bladder dysfunction.

**2. Dr. Sachin Patil Breaks It Down-**

“Bladder problems are tricky, at first, patients think it’s just ‘too much water’ or ‘stress.’ But the reality is, if these symptoms persist for more than a week, you need a check-up. The earlier we catch it, the easier it is to manage.”

According to him, **causes vary from person to person**—ranging from urinary tract infections (UTIs), overactive bladder, lifestyle factors, prostate issues in men, to even neurological conditions. And here’s where it gets deeper: a lot of young people are now facing bladder troubles because of poor hydration habits, holding urine for long hours, and excessive caffeine or alcohol intake.

He also points out another factor—**sedentary lifestyle**. Sitting at desks all day without proper water breaks? It’s slowly harming bladder health.

**3. Why People Ignore the Signs-**

One of the biggest reasons bladder issues get overlooked is embarrassment. Nobody wants to admit they peed a little during a workout or that they can’t sit through a 2-hour movie without rushing to the washroom. Add to that the myth that bladder problems “only happen to old people,” and you’ve got a recipe for silence.

Dr. Patil stresses, “Young adults come to me surprised, saying ‘I never thought this could happen to me.’ The truth is, it’s not about age. It’s about how you treat your body daily.”

**4. How to Keep Your Bladder Healthy-**

Dr. Patil suggests a few lifestyle hacks to keep things in check:

1. **Stay hydrated smartly** – Drink enough water, but avoid overdoing caffeinated or carbonated drinks.
2. **Don’t hold it in** – Train your bladder, yes, but never torture it by holding urine for long hours.
3. **Pelvic floor exercises** – Especially useful for women, these strengthen muscles that support the bladder.
4. **Maintain a healthy weight** – Extra weight adds pressure on the bladder.
5. **Eat right** – Cut down on spicy food, alcohol, and artificial sweeteners if you notice they trigger symptoms.
6. **Get regular check-ups** – Especially if you’ve had bladder issues before.

**5. Awareness-**

Here’s the bigger picture—bladder problems don’t just affect your health; they affect confidence, relationships, and overall quality of life. Imagine avoiding road trips with friends just because you’re worried about finding toilets along the way. Or not giving your 100% at work because you’re too distracted by bathroom breaks.

That’s why specialists like Dr. Sachin Patil are pushing for more awareness. By talking openly, people can recognize the signs, seek help early, and avoid complications.

**6. Where to Get Help in Pune-**

For anyone dealing with such issues, Dr. Patil and his team at AIMS Urology Hospital in Pune provide advanced diagnostics and treatments—from medications and lifestyle management to minimally invasive procedures when necessary. His approach is simple: listen, guide, and treat without making patients feel judged or uncomfortable.

So, the next time your bladder acts up, don’t just brush it off as “nothing.” Your body is smarter than you think—it’s trying to tell you something.

# Final Takeaway

Bladder problems are not rare, and they’re definitely not something to hide. If you notice signs like frequent urination, urgency, pain, or blood, it’s your body’s way of asking for help. And the sooner you act, the smoother the treatment journey is.

Or as Dr. Patil sums it up perfectly: *“Ignoring bladder problems is like ignoring a fire alarm. It won’t stop ringing until you fix the source.”*",2,1755856949.0,Healthandlifetips,1,1.0,False

**Modest fashion** moved from niche to mainstream ecommerce. Muslim spend on apparel and footwear is forecast to hit about **$428B** by 2027 (\~6.1% growth). On the operator side, Modanisa did roughly $75–86M in online sales in 2024, and in the U.S. Haute Hijab is estimated around $8M a year in revenue; pulling the category further mainstream.

*The common thread: each jumped from niche to widespread, with strong growth ahead.*

**Why now matters:** 

* The ceiling just moved. Databricks at roughly 100B, Applied at 15B, Replit’s ARR surge, Rocket Money’s billion-plus exit, and Chobani’s expansion reset what “normal” looks like for Muslim-led companies.
* The founder bench is deeper than it has ever been. Alumni from these wins are spinning out and hiring. That is how new waves start.
* The proof is visible earlier. A wise man once said ""invest in what you see everyday"". If you wait for headlines, you are late. In Replit's case, the explosive growth of vibe coding was very evident.
* **Our capital is still arriving last. That gap has not closed. That is the part we control.**



**Questions for the sub:**

* What stopped you from backing or even championing a Muslim-owned brand earlier: comfort with real estate, not knowing who was raising, or needing more proof first?
* Founders and operators, what single thing would have moved you from 1 to 2 locations or from side-project to real launch: a landlord willing to take a chance, an intro to an investor, your first 200 preorders, or something else?
* If you were to set aside a small slice for private deals this year, where does your first dollar go and why (dev tools, defense, consumer, fintech)? 
* Have you *personally* backed or helped a Muslim founder? What happened after?

Feels like we are sitting on a severely overlooked corner of the market that everyone else will eventually catch up to, so **why not us, and why not now**?

Would love to hear what you all are seeing on the ground in your city, and which one Muslim-owned brand/startup/shop deserves more attention right now.

Effective Meal Plan Strategies for 500 Calories a Day
-----------------------------------------------------

If you're considering a 500-calorie meal plan, it's essential to approach this with care and knowledge. This type of meal plan can be drastically different from standard calorie intakes, so it needs to be well-structured to ensure you meet your nutritional needs while losing weight efficiently. Below are some effective strategies to help you craft your meal plan.

### Understanding 500 Calories

First, let's clarify what a 500-calorie meal plan entails. Consuming only 500 calories per day is considered a very low-calorie diet (VLCD). This extreme limitation should only be followed under medical supervision, particularly for those with specific health conditions or weight loss goals. Your body requires energy not only from calories but also nutrients. Thus, careful planning is crucial.

### Prioritize Nutrient-Dense Foods

When you’re limited to 500 calories, every calorie counts. Focus on choosing foods that offer the highest nutritional value per calorie. Some examples include:

- Vegetables: Leafy greens, broccoli, and cucumbers are low-calorie but packed with vitamins and minerals.
- Lean proteins: Chicken breast, fish, or legumes provide essential protein without excessive calories.
- Healthy fats: Use modest amounts of olive oil or avocado to enhance flavor while keeping calories in check.
- Fruits: Berries, apples, and oranges deliver fiber and vitamins, making them excellent snack options.

### Plan Balanced Meals

Your meal plan should incorporate a balance of macronutrients: proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Each meal can consist of approximately:

- 150-200 calories from protein sources.
- 100-150 calories from healthy fats.
- 100-200 calories from fruits or vegetables.

This balance helps maintain steady energy levels and satiates your hunger throughout the day.

### Sample Meal Ideas

Here’s a simple sample meal plan for a day consuming 500 calories:

- \*\*Breakfast\*\*: 1 boiled egg (70 calories) + 1 small apple (80 calories) = 150 calories
- \*\*Lunch\*\*: 3 oz. grilled chicken (140 calories) + 1 cup steamed broccoli (55 calories) = 195 calories
- \*\*Dinner\*\*: 2 cups mixed greens (10 calories) + 1 tbsp olive oil (120 calories) = 130 calories

This example totals 475 calories, leaving a little room for any low-calorie snacks or adjustments you might need to make during the day.

### Stay Hydrated

Never underestimate the power of hydration when strictly limiting caloric intake. Drinking plenty of water can help control your appetite. You can also try herbal teas or black coffee, as they are low in calories yet can add variety to your daily fluids.

### Listen to Your Body

As you follow a 500-calorie meal plan, it's important to remain aware of how your body feels. If you experience excessive hunger, fatigue, or other health issues, it’s vital to reassess your approach. Adjust your meal plan by adding more nutrient-dense food options or consult with a healthcare professional.

### Meal Prep and Planning

Engaging in meal prep can alleviate stress and ensure that you stick to your plan. Set aside time each week to prepare your meals to avoid reaching for unhealthy options when hunger strikes. When meals are ready, you’re less likely to deviate from your caloric goals.

### Seek Professional Guidance

Because a 500-calorie meal plan is not suitable for everyone, it’s advisable to seek help from a healthcare provider or nutritionist. They can help tailor your plan to ensure you achieve your weight loss goals while safeguarding your overall health.

Remember, the goal is not only to lose weight but also to maintain long-term health. A 500-calorie meal plan can be a short-term solution, but establishing lasting healthy habits will yield the best results for your well-being.

Health Risks and Benefits of Extreme Caloric Restriction
--------------------------------------------------------

Extreme caloric restriction often garners attention because of its potential to lead to rapid weight loss. However, embarking on such a restrictive path can pose serious health risks and bring about both short-term and long-term effects on the body. Understanding these risks and benefits is crucial for anyone considering a significantly low-calorie diet, such as one consisting of a mere 500 calories a day.

### Short-term Benefits

Many individuals may initially experience noteworthy benefits from extreme caloric restriction:

- **Rapid Weight Loss:** One of the most obvious benefits is quick weight loss. For some, this can be a strong motivator that encourages adherence to the diet.
- **Improved Blood Sugar Control:** Extreme caloric restriction may lead to lower blood sugar levels, which can be beneficial for those managing insulin resistance or diabetes.
- **Enhanced Mental Clarity:** Some people report feeling mentally sharper during periods of caloric restriction, possibly due to ketogenesis, where the body starts using fat for fuel.

### Health Risks of Extreme Caloric Restriction

While the allure of rapid weight loss is tempting, the potential health risks are significant. Below are some common risks associated with extreme caloric restriction:

- **Nutrient Deficiencies:** Reducing caloric intake drastically often means lower consumption of essential nutrients. Many vitamins and minerals become hard to obtain, leading to deficiencies that can cause various health issues.
- **Muscle Loss:** The body may start breaking down muscle tissue for energy when it is not receiving adequate calories. Muscle loss can result in decreased strength and a slower metabolism, making weight management even harder in the long run.
- **Gallstones:** Rapid weight loss can increase the risk of developing gallstones. These painful conditions develop when the balance of substances in the bile is disrupted.
- **Heart Health Risks:** Extreme diets may lead to irregular heartbeats, electrolyte imbalances, or increased heart rate, putting additional strain on the heart.
- **Hormonal Imbalance:** Caloric restriction can disrupt hormone levels, leading to issues such as menstrual irregularities in women and reduced testosterone levels in men.

### Psychological Effects

The psychological impact of extreme caloric restriction can be substantial. Some individuals may experience:

- **Increased Anxiety and Depression:** Caloric restriction tends to alter mood and can lead to feelings of sadness or anxiety regarding food and body image.
- **Eating Disorders:** Over time, strict dieting can trigger unhealthy relationships with food, potentially leading to eating disorders, including anorexia or binge-eating.
- **Obsessive Thoughts About Food:** When food intake is heavily restricted, thoughts about food can become overwhelming, making it difficult to maintain a healthy social life or enjoy meals.

### Long-term Consequences

Extreme caloric restriction can result in more severe long-term health issues, making it vital to consider the sustainability of such diets:

- **Metabolic Slowdown:** Prolonged restriction may cause the body to adapt by slowing down metabolism, which can reverse weight loss efforts once normal eating resumes.
- **Weakened Immune System:** Insufficient nutrition can lead to a compromised immune system, increasing susceptibility to illness and infections.
- **Long-term Organ Damage:** Sustained nutrient deficiencies and metabolic disruptions can eventually harm vital organs, potentially leading to severe health conditions.

For those considering an extremely low-calorie diet, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional. They can provide personalized guidance based on your health status and ensure that any weight loss strategy is safe and effective. Responsible weight management should focus on sustainable habits that promote overall health and wellbeing, rather than the allure of rapid results.

### Conclusion

Creating a meal plan for 500 calories a day requires careful thought and planning. It's essential to implement effective strategies that prioritize nutritional balance while ensuring you feel satisfied throughout the day. By focusing on high-nutrient foods, incorporating plenty of vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats, you can maximize your meal plan's effectiveness. Remember to keep hydration in mind and consider healthy snacks to help curb hunger without exceeding your calorie limit.

While there can be benefits to following a low-calorie meal plan, such as rapid weight loss and potential improvements in certain health markers, it's crucial to acknowledge the potential risks. Extended extreme caloric restriction can lead to fatigue, nutrient deficiencies, and even metabolic slowdowns. Your body needs adequate energy to function at its best. Always listen to your body and consult healthcare professionals when considering such significant dietary changes.

Stay informed about the implications of a 500-calorie plan and assess whether it aligns with your personal health goals. Ultimately, the best meal plan is one that supports your long-term health and fits your lifestyle. Prioritize balance, listen to your needs, and remember that sustainable weight management involves more than just calorie counting. Embrace a holistic approach to your health for the best outcomes, nurturing both your body and mind.

1mx28bu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugInWellness/comments/1mx28bu/should_you_trust_rosmar_sanidry_cleaning_wipes/,Should You Trust Rosmar SANIDRY Cleaning Wipes for Daily Use,"Having spent the last two months using the Rosmar 1099-WPS-300E sanitizing wipes, I can safely say they've become an essential part of my cleaning routine. These wipes promise to kill 99.9% of viruses and bacteria, including notorious ones like SARS-CoV2 and influenza, and they've certainly lived up to their claims in my experience. As someone who often juggles work, personal commitments, and a home full of high-touch surfaces, I need a reliable disinfectant that doesn't leave behind residue or odors. These wipes deliver on those fronts while being surprisingly gentle on surfaces. Here's how they held up under my day-to-day testing.

**Convenience and Packaging**  
The moment I pulled out the first wipe, I could tell this product was designed with convenience in mind. The tub includes 300 generously-sized wipes that are easy to grab. They come pre-moistened in just the right way—not overly wet, which can lead to dripping, and not dry, which would render them useless. The packaging claims these wipes won't dry out over time, and so far, I’ve found that to be totally accurate. Even though I’ve reopened the tub several times throughout the week, the wipes at the bottom are just as moist as the ones on top. Their packaging is also environmentally responsible, using recyclable materials to reduce waste—a small, but significant, detail I appreciate.

**Versatility in Everyday Use**  
These unscented wipes shine in a wide variety of scenarios. From disinfecting doorknobs and countertops to cleaning the dog's paws after a stroll, they’re reliable. I even tried them on more delicate surfaces, like laptops and phones, and found no streaking, no residue, and no abrasive scratching. My partner recently spilled coffee on the work desk, and we reached for one of these wipes without hesitation—it cleaned up the mess in no time. Given their efficiency, I’ve cut down on using separate cleaners, which saves both time and energy.

**Strong Points**  
- Kills 99.9% of viruses and bacteria efficiently.  
- Large wipes that absorb well and clean wide areas quickly.  
- Non-abrasive material leaves no residue or scratches on sensitive surfaces.  

[Check Rosmar 1099-WPS-300E price on Amazon.](https://sanue.com/p/b08drttrhw/)

Another positive is how pet- and human-safe these are. Unlike other disinfectant wipes with overpowering chemical scents, these leave zero unpleasant odors. Once, I used them on the living room coffee table right before we had guests over, and no one noticed any smell—just a spotless table. The wipes also feel more robust compared to generic brands, even with heavy use. 

**Areas for Improvement**  
Admittedly, no product hits the mark perfectly for everyone, and these wipes come with a few small issues.  
- The container’s lid sometimes doesn’t snap back on tightly, which might concern those worried about long-term moisture retention.  
- Although being unscented is a plus for many, some might miss having a light, refreshing aroma after cleaning.  

**Effectiveness vs. Competitors**  
I’ve previously used other household disinfectant wipes, including those from big-name brands. Most of them either dry out too quickly or leave an overpowering chemical smell. Some even left streaks on glass surfaces. Compared to those, the Rosmar wipes stand out for their non-abrasive quality and uniform level of moisture. However, the slightly higher price point may put some people off if they’re on a budget, particularly when comparing them to store-brand alternatives. That being said, the efficiency and effectiveness of these wipes make the investment worthwhile for me. For tasks requiring a robust clean without the annoying residue, these outpace their competitors.

**Affordable Quality**  
Pricewise, this product finds itself in a sweet spot between premium and budget brands. It offers premium features like recyclable packaging and multi-surface usability without being excessively priced. Keeping in mind the 300-count packaging, each wipe feels like value well spent. Given how much ground a single wipe can cover, anyone using these will likely find they last longer than smaller, thinner alternatives. Many generic brands fall short in terms of durability—tearing halfway through cleaning—but I haven’t encountered such issues here.

I am dreading this being my first post, but who better so solve all my dilemma than the potato queen and her army. This is a bit long, hopefully not confusing and MESSY. Some context,

So my (27F) best friend, lets call her Lulu (35F) go way back to when i was in a not so great relationship, i was young (21) and dumb but the only good thing i got out of those two years was a restraining order and a best friend. She used to be in a bad marriage also, she got out too. Me and Lulu always kept up and grew closer over the years, she's kind and smart and would literally give the clothes off her back to help me. She's my best friend. Many years later my now Fiancé, lets call him Pie(27M), and I rekindled after he started working at the same new job I had gotten, I've been inlove with Pie since I was 14 and to my joy he felt the same, his aunt, Nina (45F), she's very relevant to the story i promise, also works here. Its was the best thing that's ever happened to me, things moved fast, we've been together a bit over the year and i'm engaged and getting married to my best friend next year May. Lulu immediately jumped into wedding mode when we got engaged this February, I'm talking she got me a binder, i asked her to be my maid of honour, as I couldn't see anyone else doing this. Especially as she's done this wedding thing twice, yes she's married now again for 4 ish years to her 2nd husband, lets call him Peeter (58M). it seemed like a good marriage, she loved him and I supported her even though i've never met this man (they live 10 hours away and he works allot). Well turns out he's not great, but the receptionist they hired at their hotel seemed to think he is. Long story short she caught them, by placing a video camera in their truck when he took her for ""driving lessons"". This happened recently, he still doesn't know she knows, Lulu drove down to my town and she's opening her own business, buying a house and he will find out she knows only the day she goes to get her dogs and final things to move here. #movingintheshadows. I am SO PROUD of her, my heart breaks for what she's going through and i wish i could make the pain go away. She has also offered to host our wedding for FREE in her new business as a gift, it'll be perfect.

Jump to today, where the mango hit the fan. I'm sitting outside with about 7 colleagues having a breather and one colleague says he needs to tell me something about Lulu but i can never tell her, i Immediately say no thanks, i already know everything about her and if its personal i don't want to know till she tells me herself, also we're around like 7 other colleagues, I'm not gossiping about my best friend, he blabs it out over me anyways, my jaw, and aunt Nina's drops, this isn't happening to me. She is now dating Nina's ex, lets call him Pita (46M). Now him and Nina, only way to describe it was a dumpster fire. He was controlling, had major substance issues, lied and when they broke up finally, he stalked her, fully here at work, at her home, she lived close to me and my fiancé so he would step in, he loves his aunt so much we both do, she's precious and tiny and the cutest thing, anyhoo he is a very large scary man. As im repeating no no no cant be, he reaffirms it, hes very close with Pita and swears he's changed, but Nina showed us his latest text from last night that reads "" I don't need you anymore, you should block me on texts too, please block me, you psyco"" pot calling the kettle and all of that, 

And then I remember a conversation i had with her when we were chatting wedding a few weeks ago, she mentioned meeting him and me and my fiancé explain EVERTHING to her. She just casually says oh ok i met him, and played it off like she keeps him in line and he has a good side to him, i think its weird but hey i brushed it off as he's in her friend circle, cant avoid him right? 

For weeks now she's been avoiding me, I've been keeping up via text about her new business and what's going on with us, she told me she's been terribly sick, and doesn't want to come near us as my fiancé is currently recovering from illness and barely has an immune system, fine right she is just being caring as always. I get back to my desk and i text her immediately asking for her to come over for coffee as my fiancé is in hospital getting treatment this week, i need to talk to her and at the least warn her rumours are spreading and the secrete is out right? She says she's still too sick but will try tomorrow to see me, I then overhear everyone talking about a festival tonight and Nina says she cant go cause her ex Pita will be there, leading me to believe she's been lying to see him behind my back.

This is so messy i don't even know what to tell her, i insisted i see her tomorrow and now im panicking, do i just tell her i know? do i let her tell me when she feels comfortable? She knows me and my fiancé wont ever support this man, nor want him near us and his family and ultimately our wedding. The thing is i would be disappointed if she told me but i wouldn't judge her, she has been neglected for so long and she's looking for love and acceptance in a love bombers arms. I also cant tell her who to date and not date and also i think im angry or hurt by her lying? she's never done this to me, we've had a zero lying policy. The wedding is next year May. She is planning it and hosting it.

Has anyone navigated something similar where your best friend’s new partner isn’t welcome, especially when they’re heavily involved in the wedding? I desperately need advice before tomorrow on how to navigate this without blowing up the friendship and ultimately loosing her. Help me please.",1,1755856411.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

1mx25al,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1mx25al/investigate_if_clorox_bathroom_ultra_foamer/,Investigate if Clorox Bathroom Ultra Foamer really cleans everything,"**Powerful Bathroom Cleaning Made Easy**  

Testing the Clorox Bathroom Ultra Foamer TU_2560725 was like giving my bathroom a spa treatment while I sipped coffee. From the first spray, I could tell this product meant business. The promise of just ""spray, rinse, and walk away"" isn't some marketing gimmick—it actually works! I expected to spend extra time scrubbing stubborn soap scum, but this cleaner removed it entirely in one application. My tub looked as if it had gotten a professional polish and my sink shined in a way that reminded me why I picked white fixtures—spotless and radiant!  

**Ease of Use with an Innovative Design**  

One feature that impressed me was the aerosol-free trigger mechanism. I’ve always hated the guilt of tossing out aerosol cans, so discovering this eco-friendly option felt good. Switching the trigger to the refill bottle was incredibly straightforward, and it clicked perfectly, making the whole process breeze by without spills or frustration. This reusable design means less environmental waste, which I absolutely appreciate in a world of excessive single-use plastic.  

[Check Clorox Bathroom Ultra Foamer TU_2560725 price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b0brt5r217/)  

**Impressive Versatility Across Surfaces**  

Throughout the week, I decided to test this cleaner on nearly every bathroom surface imaginable. Starting with the glazed tiles, I could see the foaming action creeping into grout lines, lifting grime I didn’t even know was there. My sinks looked fresh and disinfected after a quick spray and rinse, with no elbow grease needed. Even the exterior of the toilet bowl—usually an ignored spot—looked as close to brand new as possible. While its fresh clean scent could have been slightly stronger (I like bursts of freshness!), it was still crisp enough not to overpower the space.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Removed stubborn soap scum without effort.  
- Simple spray-and-rinse process saves time.  
- Eco-friendly reusable trigger reduces plastic waste.  

**A Few Things to Watch Out For**  

As much as I appreciated using this cleaning marvel, not everything was perfect. There are some hurdles potential users might want to consider:  
- The foamer's trigger requires patience when adjusting for refills; it’s not complicated, but it does need a firm hand.  
- It's primarily suited for light-to-moderate build-up; heavily neglected surfaces might need a second round.  
- While the scent is clean and pleasant, it doesn’t linger as long as other cleaners I’ve tried.  

**Effective Soap Scum Removal**  

The claim that this cleaner removes 100% of soap scum isn’t an exaggeration. When I used it on my glass shower doors, I was amazed by the difference. Those annoying water streaks and white, powdery deposits disappeared entirely after a single rinse. It saves both physical effort and emotional stress—especially when cleaning is often low on the “fun things to do” list.  

**Competing Products**  

Compared to other bathroom cleaners like Scrubbing Bubbles and Lysol Power Bathroom Cleaner, Clorox Bathroom Ultra Foamer pulls ahead in a few ways. What sets this product apart is its eco-friendly trigger mechanism and its focus on easy application without harsh scrubbing. The competitors often rely on traditional aerosol cans and tend to require a bit more manual effort for really tough grime. That said, Clorox foamer’s scent falls a bit short compared to the fresh and bold aromas of others in the category. However, for anyone prioritizing efficiency and reducing plastic waste, this is an obvious win.  

**Smart Spending**  

Considering all its features, the Clorox Bathroom Ultra Foamer TU_2560725 offers excellent value for money. Its refill option not only lowers the environmental impact but also helps with budget management in the long run. Cheaper cleaning products might tempt you initially, but they often lack the reliability and heavy-duty performance this product guarantees. You save time, energy, and resources when you don’t have to constantly repeat a cleaning session.

Full Review,"Testing the Persil 2584760 and its Free & Sensitive Liquid Laundry Detergent has been an experience worth sharing, not only for its cleaning prowess but also for its skin-friendly formula. Being someone who juggles between laundry runs and sensitive skin issues in my household, I brought this liquid detergent into our routine expecting something above the average chore soap. It did not disappoint but naturally has its quirks.

**Gentle Formula, Tough Performance**  
The foremost aspect that drew me toward this detergent was its unscented and dye-free composition. Calling it hypoallergenic isn't just clever marketing; my family members with fragile skin noticed fewer irritations after switching. It’s a game-changer when you’ve been avoiding “fresh-smelling” detergents that leave your skin rebelling. On the downside, if you enjoy bold fragrances from your clothes post-wash, this might feel too subdued. However, I prefer that over unnecessary synthetic scents being rubbed into our clothes.

**Efficient in Stain Removal**  
I make a big deal about stain-fighting abilities – kids and I are outright pros at creating the worst laundry scenarios. To my delight, this detergent faced off against tomato sauce, ink splatters, and even coffee spills. The concentrated formula truly surprised me. It seemed like a smaller dose did the magic compared to other products I’ve used. The deep-clean properties don’t only shine but also seem to gently prolong fabric life. Clothes felt less worn-out when fresh out of the dryer.

**Designed for All Machines**  
This product doesn’t play favorites between High-Efficiency (HE) washers and standard machines. I appreciated that flexibility because my mother-in-law tested it on her more traditional washer and raved about the evenly clean results. A universal detergent like this saves the hassle of buying separate products for different machine types.

**Why My Closet Says Thank You**  
One of the other quirks of this detergent? It's adept at preserving those vivid colors. My vibrant reds and royal blues are still popping weeks down the line. Usually, laundry detergent leans too harsh; your favorite tops fade by round five. This one lives up to claims of keeping clothes feeling and looking “newer.” Suddenly, replacing your wardrobe becomes less urgent. Convenience is the word here.

**Positives**  
- Hypoallergenic, safe for sensitive skin.  
- Highly concentrated formula, requiring less detergent per load.  
- Compatible with both HE and standard washers.  
- Effective stain removal and fabric longevity.  

**Limitations**  
- Unscented profile lacks the freshness some people love.  
- May require pre-treatment for extremely tough, set-in stains.  

**Versus the Competition**  
As a borderline obsessive comparison shopper, I had to check this detergent against names like Tide Free & Gentle or Seventh Generation Free & Clear. While competitors sometimes feel diluted or require hefty doses for supposed effectiveness, this one packs the cleaning power in a smaller volume. Seventh Generation holds its own when it comes to environmental consciousness, though, for folks chasing sustainability primarily. But for maintaining fabric integrity and no sneaky triggers for eczema-prone skin, I’d give Persil the edge.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Admittedly, liquid detergents in this premium category rarely qualify as “cheap,” but when you stretch its concentrated power, the cost per load becomes reasonable. It feels like the product truly complements the “you get what you pay for” principle. For me and my peace of mind, it earns a spot on the must-buy list.

1mx23q5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mx23q5/explore_the_ninja_dualbrew_coffee_maker_review/,Explore the Ninja DualBrew Coffee Maker review and its iced coffee features!,"The Ninja CFP101 DualBrew Hot & Iced Coffee Maker has been an essential part of my mornings for a few weeks now, and I truly feel as though I’ve uncovered all its quirks and benefits. Whether crafting a quick cup of iced coffee for an afternoon pick-me-up or brewing a full pot to fuel a busy day, this coffee maker has been through the paces with me. Admittedly, I’ve developed quite a fondness for its versatility, but there are certainly aspects that could be refined.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This machine doesn't shy away from taking up space on the counter, but I appreciate its sleek black design, which effortlessly blends into my kitchen. Measuring 11.03 inches deep, 9.9 inches wide, and 15.22 inches tall, it’s not petite by any means—but the size is justified given its functionality. I love how the foldable single-serve platform minimizes splash when brewing directly into a smaller mug, while the carafe is built with a sturdy glass that feels quite durable. The 60-ounce removable water reservoir is a blessing, as it’s easy to carry to the sink and refill without awkward spills.

**Performance and Brewing Versatility**  
The performance is where this coffee maker shines. With the ability to brew both ground coffee and pods, it caters to just about anyone’s preference. I mostly stick to ground coffee, but my sister, who visits frequently, swears by the convenience of pods. The machine’s 9 brewing sizes for grounds and 4 sizes for pods ensure you can always get just the right amount. Whether I’m brewing a single cup or a full carafe, the coffee comes out consistently hot and flavorful, thanks to its thermal flavor extraction duo. I find the precision temperature control particularly impressive—it’s a game-changer for brewing rich-tasting coffee.  

[Check Ninja CFP100 Series price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0cmvd6jb1/)

**Special Features and Settings**  
This coffee maker offers three brewing styles: classic, rich, and over ice, which is perfect for someone like me who switches between hot coffee on cool mornings and iced coffee later in the day. The “over ice” feature ensures my iced coffee isn’t diluted, and that’s life-changing for anyone who’s ever endured watered-down java. Another standout feature is the adjustable warming plate, which keeps my coffee hot for up to four hours. It’s saved me on mornings when I’ve brewed a carafe and spent hours distracted by work tasks or my kids.  

**Highlights**  
- Extremely versatile with options for both grounds and pods.  
- Built-in warming plate keeps coffee at an ideal temperature for hours.  
- No watered-down iced coffee with the dedicated “over ice” brew setting.  

**Limitations**  
- Cleaning the Ninja pod adapter can be fiddly, especially after frequent use.  
- Despite being “programmable,” there’s no option for scheduled brewing.  
- It’s bulky, so if you’re tight on counter space, it might feel intrusive.  

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Cleaning is relatively simple overall, but there’s a small caveat. The dishwasher-safe parts and the clean function make routine cleaning straightforward. However, the pod adapter needs more frequent attention, especially if you alternate between pods and ground coffee as much as I do. It’s not a dealbreaker for me, but it’s hard to ignore. The paper filter kit included is a nice touch, although I eventually switched to a reusable metal filter for convenience.

**Rival Brands**  
Before settling on this coffee maker, I considered a few others, such as the Keurig K-Elite and the Breville precision brewer. While Keurig excels at pod-based coffee and has a more compact design, it lacks the same flexibility in brewing grounds. On the other hand, Breville is a hit for its temperature precision and customization, but it’s significantly pricier and doesn’t offer any pod compatibility. The Ninja CFP101 strikes a commendable balance, offering the best of both worlds while staying relatively affordable.

**Value for Money**  
Considering its dual brewing capability, multiple size options, and specialty brew settings, this product delivers strong cost efficiency. It’s obviously more expensive than a basic drip coffee maker, but when factoring in its versatility and extra features, I’d say it provides excellent value. Similar products often sacrifice either pod compatibility or brewing flexibility, so this feels like a smart buy for those who want it all.

1mx1zn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttachmentParenting/comments/1mx1zn5/contacts_naps/,Contacts naps,"Hi, I'd really appreciate some words of support or practical tips. I have an EBF 5.5 month boy who only contact naps (he wakes up as soon as I transfer him to his cot). At night he sleeps in his cot in our room without any problems and only wakes up once or twice. 

Whilst I love supporting him during his naps, the issue I'm facing is that he also hates the car seat / pram / pushchair (I have not tried the upright position as he is not ready for it). He enjoys the carrier (provided I'm walking), but he is almost 9kg and my back hurts after less than an hour (plus we have had a very warm summer here in London which also limited opportunities for carrying him).

As a result, my mental health is deteriorating a bit as I have no me time when he is napping, and when he is awake we can barely make it to the local park. When awake, he constantly needs my attention (with the exception of the first 10 minutes after a nap when he is happy with his toys) and he does not like the carrier inside home.

I tried meeting up with other local mums for coffee but even that it's very difficult - I'd take him out of the carrier and hold him once at the coffee shop, but he is an energetic and observant boy who wriggles a lot / wants to observe / wants to mouth everything (including my drink!) and is not happy staying in the same spot for long. When is not happy, he has a very loud cry, which easily escalates to hysterical crying.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

Ear mite treatment is crucial for pet owners, especially for cats and dogs, as these pesky parasites can lead to discomfort and serious health issues. Ear mites, scientifically known as Otodectes cynotis, thrive in the ear canal and feed on the wax and oils present in the ears. Identifying the presence of ear mites early on can significantly aid in the effectiveness of the treatment.

The first step in ear mite treatment is to consult a veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis. Signs of infestation may include excessive scratching, head shaking, and dark, crumbly debris in the ears resembling coffee grounds. A professional evaluation is essential as it ensures that the method chosen is suitable for your pet's specific condition.

Once diagnosed, ear mite treatment typically includes:

Topical medications: Vet-prescribed topical solutions can effectively eliminate ear mites and soothe inflammation. Ear cleaning: Cleaning the ears thoroughly before applying medication enhances its effectiveness. This can be done at home with vet-approved ear cleansers. Oral medications: In severe cases, oral medications or injectable treatments may be necessary to eradicate the infestation.

Completing the full course of ear mite treatment is essential to prevent re-infestation. After treatment, regular ear inspections and cleanings can help keep your pet’s ears healthy. Additionally, maintaining a clean environment can minimize the chances of future infestations.

Preventative care is always the best approach; thus, regular veterinary visits and proper hygiene should be part of your pet’s routine. Staying proactive can help avoid the discomfort of ear mites and ensure your furry friend remains happy and healthy.

1mx1vn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mx1vn7/feed/,Feed,"Yet another freezing morning.



Well, I assume it is. In here it’s a perfect 21 degrees Celsius. Out there it’s around -10 degrees at the most, always.



I make my way down to the canteen. There are already some people there. I’m always the last one. I don’t know why, I wasn’t like this at the beginning, but these days there is zero motivation left in me.

The same terrible coffee every morning, the same terrible Daniel every morning. I put up with it all for nothing. 



Without much excitement I walk to my post to start my day. Eve and Raul are already there. I can already hear Raul in my head: 'working only half a day, huh'



''Working only half a day, huh?'' Raul greets me. Ugh, if I could hop in a car I’d drive home right now. 



But I can’t. When they sent the six of us here it was pretty exciting. Something about a secret discovery, very hush hush. We were sent to Antarctica to investigate a discovery made by one of the satellites. Well, supposedly made by one of the satellites. 7 months have passed and we’ve found jack shit. You can already tell I’m done with this whole 'investigation'.







“Hi Raul, good morning to you too’’, I greet him back. ‘’Afternoon, you mean!’’ he replies. Will it ever stop?



I take a seat at my place and start staring. Staring like I have been for these past 7 months. Staring and thinking about where I wish I’d be right now. Staring at the screen that shows the view of our deepwater camera. I see the same kind of fish all the time. I’ve even secretly started to name them. If my coworkers found out they might throw me off the project. Maybe that’s what I want after all…



I keep staring. It’s all the same, only the names will change. Every day, it seems we’re wasting away.

I shake my head and realize I have lapsed into song lyrics again. My mind can’t keep tethered to this mind numbing experience.



 

Luckily Eve snaps me out of it. ''Ready for another day of spying on fish?'' Sometimes it feels like she is the only other normal person on this compound. I say jokingly that that’s what I’m here for. Sadly she turns back to her work and l go back to staring at this screen in front of me.



Hours go by, or is it minutes? I can never tell. When I’m sitting at my desk I lose all concept of time, all I know is water and fish. All the sudden I’m shaken awake. The camera starts moving at a high speed downwards diagonally. ''Raul what the hell man!” I look up from my screen and see Raul sweating, pulling on the joystick. ''I’m not doing that'' he says. Eve rushes over and so do I. This is the most exciting work has been since the second day.





We rush to Raul and see he’s trying to pull the observation sub in the opposite direction its going. Raul’s the first one to suggest: ''It must be stuck on something''. I lose interest immediately. Oh well, maybe hopefully the camera will break and we will get to go home. It is after all the only one we had available.





''that’s it folks, time to wrap the show up!'' I proclaim. Raul shatters my hopes and dreams: ''It’s stopped! No wait, it’s moving slowly now!''. I walk over to my screen and the others follow. By this time the others in the canteen down the hall have heard the commotion and have rushed over. All six of us are standing around my desk watching. “What happened?’’ asked Dave. Eve shushed him. I love it when she does that. Dave is our leading scientist and what he says goes, unless Eve is around. She always knew how to put him in place.





''Can you hear that?'' she turns the volume knob all the way to the maximum. It’s no use. There is never a sound down there. I mockingly and silently laughed at the engineers many, many times since we came here. I couldn’t help but crack a smile again. It was the single most usele…. BEEP BEEP BEEEEP BEEP. There’s a sound!



We all lean in instinctively trying to hear better. I have no idea what it is, what could this beeping be and WHAT is making that sound? Daniel shouts out: ''Its morse code!''. Ugh, of course DANIEL knows what it is.



''What is it then?’’ I ask him. He listens for a little while. And then another and another.





I take my eyes off the screen and realise the others have done the same. Daniel looks like he’s seen a ghost. ''feed’’ he whimpers. I stare at him blankly. ''feed what?’’ I ask. Daniel replies: ''I don’t know, it just says feed.’’ 



We are all baffled. We stand around for a couple of hours, listening, watching but nothing happens. Nobody lost interest but it was no good to all stand around and do nothing. Everyone goes back to their place. Except Eve, she’s still at my desk watching and listening. I don’t mind that she stays.





We both stare in silence and yet again my mind goes elsewhere. But this time it isn’t a sunny beach or a nice warm cozy place with a cold drink in my hand. It is to the mission briefing seven months ago. An unidentified flying object crashed into the Southern Ocean. Yes, yes, hold your horses, I am indeed talking about a UFO. We have been sent her in search of a UFO and it was made out to be something very important and classified. 





As I have already made clear, for seven whole months we hadn’t found anything. We were very close on giving up hope, I already had. Today was the most excitement we had during work since I could remember.





''Go grab some rest’’, Eve says to me. ''we’ve been here for hours.'' I take a look at the clock and realize she is right. We are way past midnight. Time has never gone faster here before.  Normally I would have said something like ‘Oh Eve no, you please go ahead, I’ll stay’ or ‘I don’t need rest, I can do this all day’ but today has really drained me. I thank her and quickly make my way to the sleeping quarters. 





I crash on my bed and all the questions fade away. At least the bed is nice, I think, as I have thought every night since I’ve arrived in this place. I close my eyes. Darkness. Darkness like the ocean we have been watching for months. Darkness like the place the camera was brought. Beep beep beeeep beep. It still rings through my head. Feed. What do we need to feed? What do we need to feed it with? So many questions we have. Questions we can find the answer to tomorrow.



Today is not like just some other freezing morning. I make my way to the canteen and find nobody there. I can already guess where everyone is. I quickly ate breakfast and I notice its my first breakfast without Daniel sharing his random fact of the day. With a cup of coffee in my hand I make my way to the observation room. Again, people have gathered around my desk. ‘’What is happening’’, I ask, but nobody cares to look up from my screen.





By that time I notice the beeping has changed. I still don’t understand anything. I take a look at Daniel and he says to me: ‘’feed, come.’’ OK, that’s creepy. Dave claps in his hands, demanding everyone’s attention and tells us to go to the conference room. 

We each take a seat around the table and Robert is the first to break the silence: ‘’ So, everybody, any thoughts?’’. As the oldest of the group Robert liked to think he was in charge. Dave knew he wasn’t, Eve knew even better. Everyone turns their heads to me. ‘’ Neil, you have been in charge of observation. Have you ever noticed anything strange?’’ Dave asks. I scrape my throat before I speak. ‘’No, never. I’ve stared at the screen and I have not once in our time here seen anything like these past two days.’’ He turns his head to Raul: ‘’Any idea where the observation sub is now?’’ ‘’Well, what we saw last is that the sub seemed to pass through the opening of the mouth of a dead blue whale, but it hasn’t come out. It’s safe to say it’s still in there’’.





‘’Also, what up with that creepy Morse code?’’, Eve sadly addresses. I didn’t want to give that part any thought. It creeped me out. I think it creeped everybody out, because nobody said a word.

Unfortunately no important questions were answered during that meeting. We all return to our stations and another day passes. 

In my bed at night I can’t help but feel a sense of dread come over me. ‘feed, come’. Those two words are scaring me. Will there be another word tomorrow? I really don’t want to find out, yet I drift away to sleep and tomorrow comes.

 

Another perfect temperature morning where I assume the outside is freezing like Hell. Only this time it isn’t perfect. Its cold inside. That is impossible. I get up and look at the little digital clock that is sitting on my desk. 02:43. Why am I awake? My alarm doesn’t go off for hours. Suddenly the cold hits me hard, was it the cold that has woken me up? I grab my parka from my closet and make my way down. I see everyone is gathered around in the canteen. “Hey, has the door been opened or something?’’ I call out in the open. People look at me with a bewildered look on their face. Nobody speaks a word. I notice Dave and Robert are gearing up for what seems like an outdoor expedition.





Suddenly I don’t feel so good. There is something wrong. I notice stains on the wall. What the hell happened? As I get closer I realise it is words that are on the wall, not just stains. I read the words and tears of pure fear and shock come out of my eyes. “Who the hell wrote this!’’ I shout. Again I’m ignored. I get frustrated. I cannot believe this is happening. That damn Daniel pulling one of his stupid pranks again. I’ve had it. I’ve reached my limit. I am going to punch him and get sent home for fighting. I do not care anymore. I just want to go home. 

Then I suddenly realise it is just the five of us there. Daniel is nowhere to be seen.

‘’OK everybody, Robert and I will be back in two hours!’’ Dave shouts and they go through the first safety door. I don’t want to be here. I also want to go out, but I want to go out and go home, the office, anywhere but here. I realise Eve is crying. I need to comfort her. But as I’m walking towards her I get close to the stains on the wall. It smells bad. As a doctor and scientist I know that smell. It’s the smell of blood. My body seems to be unable to move once I realise what it is. 



I need to be strong. I cannot panic now, not now. Leave that for later. I approach the stains and see the kitchen knife is on the floor next to the wall, completely covered in blood. I am getting sick. Why? Who did this? Was it really Daniel? Why would he do such a thing? My mind was racing. I’m getting dizzy and I need to sit down. After a small moment of recollecting myself I realise Eve is still sobbing. She needs to get out of here. With all my strength I stand up and I walk towards her.



''Eve, please. Come with me.’’ I hold her by the arms and shoulders and I guide her to the bedrooms. As we are both walking away, completely in shock I can feel the words written on the wall staring at us. It is like I have eyes in the back of my head; I can still read them. There is no questions left to ask or answer. There is no research left to be done. All that’s left is to call the people back home and arrange immediate transportation. We are almost there. I can’t help but look back one more time at the large letters written in blood on our wall.

Here’s a simple breakdown of what happens inside the bean during roasting:

Drying Phase (Evaporation, Endothermic) → Beans lose moisture until ~100°C (boiling point).

Yellowing (130–140°C) → Beans turn yellow, grassy smell fades.

Maillard Reaction (~154°C) → Sugars + amino acids react, creating complex flavors + aromas.

Caramelization (160–200°C) → Sweetness and body develop, darker notes appear.

First Crack (~194°C, Exothermic) → Beans release energy, expansion happens = light roast stage.

Development Phase → The roast profile is decided here (light, medium, dark) depending on how long you continue after first crack.


⚡Endothermic = beans absorb heat.
🔥 Exothermic = beans release heat (cracking).

This curve shows how time + temperature directly shape flavor in your cup. 🌸☕

""Target behaviors?"" you might ask. ""What does that even mean?""

Think of it this way: Marketing focuses on a **target market**. Branding, on the other hand, should focus on a **target behavior**.

The core principle is that your audience needs a specific trigger, a clear moment when they know it's time to buy and use your product. Your goal is to find a place in their daily routine, from the moment they wake up until they go to sleep, where your product can solve a specific problem tied to a specific action.

For example, let's say someone needs their morning coffee, but for some reason, their usual option isn't available right when they need it. If your brand can step in and solve that immediate problem, the likelihood of a purchase skyrockets.

That right there? That's what I call a **""Brand High Call to Action.""**

1mx1kvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1mx1kvi/uncover_if_bogda_5stage_water_filter_replacement/,Uncover if BOGDA 5-Stage Water Filter Replacement Lives Up to Reviews,"Testing water filters might sound mundane, but the BOGDA 6 Pack Water Filter Replacement Zero (model B0D5M35N5L) proved to be more interesting than I expected. I've been actively using these filters in a household of five, and given the importance of clean drinking water, these have seen some heavy-duty testing. While the overall performance left me impressed, there are a few aspects worth pointing out.

**DESIGN AND BUILD QUALITY**  
The build quality of these filter replacements caught my attention right out of the box. Each filter felt sturdy, and the polypropylene material seemed built to withstand some abuse. Installing the filters into my Zero dispenser was smoother than I expected—just twist it into the bottom reservoir, and you're good to go. I appreciated the eco-forward approach in using food-grade plastic since I prefer products considerate of health and the environment. The 5-stage filtration system adds a layer of confidence, knowing my family is drinking water that's been filtered more thoroughly than standard options.

**FILTRATION EFFECTIVENESS**  
As someone who monitors water quality obsessively, I immediately tested this with a TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) meter. The claim of reaching a 0 TDS value didn’t quite hold up consistently, but depending on the quality of tap water in our region, it hovered near zero for the most part. I was pleasantly surprised that it managed to filter out nearly 99% of dissolved solids, chlorine, and metals. My kids found the water noticeably tastier—something they actually commented on, which says a lot. However, filtration performance did drop slightly closer to the end of a filter's life, which was expected but still worth noting.

**INSTALLATION AND USABILITY**  
Replacing these filters couldn't be easier. A simple twist-and-click mechanism saves you from any unnecessary struggles, which is a blessing in a busy household. In terms of usage, these filters boast impressive speed, processing a gallon of water in approximately ten minutes. This pace was a game-changer for my family, especially during summer when everyone's rushing for chilled water. The filters claim to desalinate up to 60 liters before needing a swap, and based on my experience, they lived up to that mark, averaging around 58-60 liters.

[Check BOGDA B0D5M35N5L price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0d5m35n5l/)

**PERFORMANCE IN A LARGE HOUSEHOLD**  
In my household, filtered water is used for everything—from drinking to cooking, even brewing coffee. These filters consistently handled our water needs without ""slowing down."" The fast filtration setup is super-efficient, particularly when you're donning the role of the house bartender during family dinners. However, if your main water source has extreme impurities, you might need to replace the filters slightly earlier than the advertised lifespan. Repetition of this expense might not be everyone's cup of tea.

**HIGHLIGHTS**  
- Straightforward installation; functional twist-and-click mechanism.  
- Effectively removes nearly 99% of dissolved solids and impurities.  
- Provides a fast water filtration process, saving time.  
- Made using eco-conscious, food-grade material for added safety.  

**CAVEATS**  
- Filtration output declines towards the end of a filter’s lifespan.  
- Performance may vary based on the quality of your water source.  
- Some users might find the need for replacements frequent depending on usage.  

**ALTERNATIVE OFFERINGS**  
While BOGDA filters offer robust performance, the competition in this space isn’t far behind. The Brita Longlast filters, for instance, come close in terms of TDS reduction, but they don’t quite match the consistency BOGDA provides on removing dissolved solids. On the other hand, ZeroWater’s own replacement filters are nearly identical in function but lack some of the user-friendly design features BOGDA has employed. Brita units may offer a more cost-effective solution for smaller households, but for families like mine, BOGDA’s faster filtration and larger filtration capacity keeps them ahead.

**WORTH EVERY PENNY**  
Though not the cheapest filters out there, the extra investment in these replacements delivers when clean water becomes a non-negotiable facet of everyday life. The nearly-zero TDS performance, coupled with eco-conscious design and ease of use, makes this product a strong contender in its niche. However, potential buyers should factor in recurring costs, as filters may need replacement sooner in areas with less-than-ideal tap water conditions. That said, the value proposition remains solid for households looking for pure water free from impurities.

So after my last post here, I've had 4 dates with this guy now. First date lasted all day, adventure golf, coffee and dinner. Second date a week later was cinema and dinner, and we had our first kiss. I won't go into detail about how much time I needed to process that afterwards lol! 

He ended up coming to mine again the day after because he was in the area. We just had a cup of tea and cuddled, he didn't go home til almost midnight. It was really nice. We did make out and I stopped before things got too far. 

I invited him for dinner last night which we both enjoyed. Had a really nice cuddling and movie session again afterwards. There was another makeout session that got steamy (this is embarrassing for me to admit lol). Again I stopped before things got too far, because I don't want to end up doing something I regret. 

We have a nice ""day out"" date planned for this weekend, but we both have the next day off work, so he's gonna stay at mine for the night and we can spend the next day together chilling.

1mx18f9,https://i.redd.it/7xbl3q29bjkf1.jpeg,ASUS ROG Strix 1200W Platinum (Fully Modular Power Supply) – Worth It?,"If you’ve ever built a gaming PC, you know the struggle: flashy GPUs, RGB everything, water cooling setups that make your room look like a spaceship… and then the power supply. The humble PSU usually gets ignored until your system suddenly reboots mid-game and you’re staring at a black screen thinking, “Why now?!” That’s why I wanted to talk about the **ASUS ROG Strix 1200W Platinum Fully Modular Power Supply**.

This beast isn’t just another brick with cables. It’s marketed as one of the most reliable, high-performance PSUs you can buy right now. But is it really worth dropping your hard-earned cash on? Let’s break it down together, casually, like we’re sitting at a desk with a coffee, swapping PC build stories.

# First Impressions – A Monster PSU with Style

When you unbox the **ASUS ROG Strix 1200W Platinum PSU**, the first thing you notice is the build quality. It feels solid. ASUS didn’t cut corners on design—there’s brushed aluminum, customizable decals, and even RGB (because of course there is). And honestly, if you’re building a rig with an RTX 4090, a power supply this beefy just looks right at home.

What caught my eye? The fully modular design. No one likes wrestling with extra spaghetti cables hanging around your case. With this PSU, you only plug in what you need. That means **cleaner cable management**, better airflow, and more space for those chunky GPUs that take up half your case.

[Check the ASUS ROG Strix 1200W Platinum on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3HOqi7j)

# Why 1200W? Do You Really Need That Much Power?

Let’s be honest. Not everyone needs 1200 watts. If you’re running a modest mid-range setup, this is like bringing a bazooka to a water balloon fight. But if you’re the type who wants:

* A high-end CPU (Ryzen 9, Intel i9, you name it)
* An RTX 4090 or RX 7900 XTX
* Multiple NVMe drives and a stack of fans
* Maybe even a custom water loop

Then yeah, you’ll thank yourself later for having that **extra headroom**.

Ever tried running a system at 90% PSU load all the time? Not fun. Heat, noise, and the constant fear of crashing during a ranked match. With 1200W, you’ve got **future-proofing**. Even if you upgrade your GPU again in two years, you’re covered.

# Platinum Certification – Why It Matters

So, the “Platinum” in **ASUS ROG Strix 1200W Platinum** isn’t just marketing fluff. It’s an **80 Plus Platinum certification**, which basically means the PSU is ridiculously efficient.

To translate the jargon:

* At 50% load, it’s about **92% efficient**.
* Less power wasted = less heat.
* Less heat = quieter operation and longer lifespan.

Sure, you could buy a cheaper Gold-certified unit, but if you’re sinking money into a high-end build, shaving off those wasted watts adds up over time (and keeps your room from turning into a sauna).

# Cooling and Noise – Surprisingly Quiet

One of my biggest pet peeves is a PSU fan that sounds like a jet engine. Luckily, the **ROG Strix 1200W** comes with **ROG Axial-tech fan design** and a 0dB mode. Translation: the fan doesn’t even spin until you hit a certain load.

When it does spin, it’s whisper quiet. I ran a stress test with a 4090 + Ryzen 9 combo, and the PSU fan barely made a peep. Honestly, the GPU fans were way louder, so the PSU kind of disappeared into the background—exactly how it should be.

# Fully Modular = Builder’s Dream

If you’ve built PCs before, you know cable clutter is the enemy. The fully modular design here means you plug in only the cables you need. No extra mess. No stuffing unused cables behind the case panel like you’re hiding dirty laundry.

Plus, ASUS actually includes **high-quality sleeved cables**, which look way better than the flat, ugly ones many PSUs ship with. If you’re into aesthetics (and let’s be real, most of us RGB addicts are), this makes a difference.

[Grab the ASUS ROG Strix 1200W Platinum here](https://amzn.to/3HOqi7j)

# Key Features at a Glance

Here’s a quick list for the skimmers who hate walls of text:

* **1200W power output** – Handles top-tier GPUs and CPUs with ease.
* **80 Plus Platinum efficiency** – Saves energy and reduces heat.
* **Fully modular cables** – Cleaner builds and better airflow.
* **ROG Axial-tech fan with 0dB mode** – Silent under low loads.
* **10-year warranty** – ASUS actually backs this thing long-term.
* **Premium Japanese capacitors** – Reliability you can trust.

# Gaming & Performance – Does It Actually Deliver?

Okay, specs are nice, but how does it hold up under real-world gaming loads? I tested it with Cyberpunk 2077 (maxed settings, because why not). My system pulled heavy wattage, but the PSU handled it without breaking a sweat. No coil whine, no weird voltage drops, nothing.

It’s the kind of stability you don’t notice—which is exactly what you want from a PSU. Ever had random system crashes and thought your GPU was cursed, only to later find out your cheap PSU was the culprit? Yeah, not fun. This one just works.

# Comparisons – How It Stacks Up

So how does the **ASUS ROG Strix 1200W Platinum** compare to other premium PSUs?

* **Corsair AX1200i** – Also great, but pricier and sometimes harder to find.
* **EVGA SuperNOVA 1200 P2** – Solid option, but noisier under load.
* **Seasonic PRIME TX-1200** – Legendary quality, though ASUS edges it out with better aesthetics.

IMO, the ASUS wins if you care about a mix of performance **and** style. If you’re building in a tempered glass case, that ROG branding and RGB edge lighting will look killer.

# The Downsides (Because Nothing’s Perfect)

Alright, here’s the honest part. There are a couple of things I don’t love:

* **Pricey.** This PSU isn’t cheap, and you’re paying extra for the ROG branding.
* **Overkill for casual builds.** If you’re not running high-end hardware, it’s like putting premium fuel in a scooter.
* **Size.** It’s big. Make sure your case actually fits it before hitting “buy.”

That said, the pros outweigh the cons if you’re serious about high-performance builds.

# Who Should Buy It?

You’ll get the most out of this PSU if you’re:

* A **hardcore gamer** with a high-end rig.
* An **enthusiast overclocker** who pushes hardware to the limit.
* A **content creator** running multiple GPUs for rendering.
* Someone who just wants the peace of mind that comes with a **10-year warranty** and platinum efficiency.

If you’re rocking a mid-tier GPU and don’t plan on upgrading anytime soon, you could save some money with a lower wattage Gold-certified PSU. But if you want **future-proofing**, this is the one.

# Final Verdict

The **ASUS ROG Strix 1200W Platinum Fully Modular Power Supply** is one of those components you buy once and don’t think about again for years. It’s **powerful, efficient, quiet, and future-proof**. Sure, it’s a bit pricey, but you’re paying for rock-solid reliability and ASUS ROG flair.

If you’re building a monster rig and don’t want your PSU to be the weak link, this is absolutely worth considering. In short: it’s the kind of PSU you buy, forget about, and then smile every time your PC runs buttery smooth under load.

[Resurrected (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15340206) summary:

>In a dystopian future, the Vatican knows how to resurrect people. A priest discovers a conspiracy behind the resurrections and their possible link to a series of murders.

The Catholic Church discovers the secret of bringing people back from the dead. What is that secret? We never find out. No hints at all. None. No, not even at the end of the movie.

They offer this service to all... as long as you're a Christian and their complete investigation of your digital footprint, both public and private, shows that you're ""righteous"" enough for them. Otherwise they'll refuse to bring you back and you stay dead. It's the Christian way. As one would expect from the religion of the God of love.

Most of the protests are flaccid ""right to die"" protests rather than demands to make the church cough up the secret, and there is seemingly NO plot here about any government taking any interest at all in how any of this works… but... anyway...

So the whole planet opts into this service. Over a billion people (literally) get resurrected. Catholicism dominates the planet.

Amazing premise right? Too bad all of that is completely beside the point.

So there's this family. Insufferable mom, alcoholic dad, rascally kid. Kid dies in a car accident, and he's the first one back from the dead. No, he doesn't come back evil, he's fine. Mom blames dad for the accident, they split, dad becomes a priest. He spends most days counselling people who've come back from the dead. And then two people he's counselling commit acts of mass murder.

So there's probably a supernatural explanation right? Or some secret agenda from the church? Or even a grand plan made from otherworldly powers? Or maybe there's a flaw in the way this ""back from the dead"" stuff works! Oh wow I can't wait to find out what it is!

Think of the weakest answer. It's that.

**Should you watch it?** This movie has an incredible premise and does not deliver on it. ""It's a movie about the Catholic Church bringing people back from the dead!"" ""Oh wow so how does that affect the main plot?"" ""It doesn't! What happens is irrelevant to how they return people from the dead, or the fact that it happened to be the Catholic Church doing it, and could have happened under any one of a dozen other scenarios.""

Wut.

But despite that I mean... there's blood, there's violence, there's mania, there's mass murder and a half-decent fight scene. The acting's fine, there's plotty-wotty mystery, and a (kind of irrelevant) conspiracy, and another conspiracy, and twists and turns. It's a lot of drama.

Oh and also you get to go to a coffee shop with your friend afterwards be all intellectual and philosophical about privacy, and ""sin"", and the role of religion in our lives and who has the right to determine the fate of all mankind... but that discussion would be a lot more interesting if there was any hint at all as to how people were being brought back in the first place.

Just don't think too hard about it and it's pretty great. I mean this is a movie where people hold their cameras up in perfect selfie pose while desperately running for their lives.

But if you insist on things adding up, or for the chain of events to seem inevitable rather than random, then you're gonna have a bad time.

(WJAR) — A reported romantic relationship between Cranston City Council President Jessica Marino and the council’s attorney, Stephen Angell, is raising questions after the council voted this week to amend Angell’s contract.

Marino abstained from voting during Wednesday night’s meeting, but the amendment still passed.

The decision set off criticism from Republicans on the council, as well as from the city’s GOP leadership, who say the situation creates a conflict of interest.

NBC 10 has not confirmed when the relationship began, or if one currently exists.

Council Minority Leader Richard Campopiano said Marino pushed for changes without fully informing council members or the public.

Cranston Republican Party Chairman John Colasante said the process was rushed and undermined transparency.

“There’s a clear conflict of interest between the council president and the attorney to the city council,” Colasante told NBC 10. “How can the council attorney represent the entire council impartially while having an existing romantic relationship with the council president?”

Colasante also raised concerns about the way the meetings were scheduled and conducted.

“With the timing of this special meeting, why so soon? Why not wait for the next scheduled meeting? What was the rush here?” he asked.

He added that residents only saw copies of the contract amendments minutes before the vote.

“It felt like a game show. How quickly can you review a legal document of this nature? So it just felt like the Cranston residents were slighted by this,"" Colasante said.

NBC 10 spoke with two legal experts who said the reported relationship raises serious ethical questions.

NBC 10 legal analyst Austin Dana explained the role of the council’s attorney.

“The attorney for the city council is there to give legal advice to the council, handle any litigation matters that may arise, and advise them about any legal things that may come up,” Dana said.

But Dana said a personal relationship complicates that role.

“The American Bar Association encourages attorneys never to get into a romantic relationship with their client because it can cloud your legal judgment. When you’re in a romantic relationship with somebody on the council — in this case the president — that could cloud your judgment. And that can be a problem,” he said.

Dana also said both Marino and Angell share responsibility.

“The president of the council wants to avoid the appearance of impropriety. And from an attorney’s standpoint, you have a duty to your client — the entire council, not just the president — to give sound legal advice that’s not clouded by any romantic relationship. They both hold equal responsibility in my eyes.”

Roger Williams School of Law Professor Peter Margulies agreed.

“It’s very important to be neutral and not to set up a conflict between the lawyer’s professional obligations and the lawyer’s personal relationships,” he said.

Margulies stressed that the issue goes beyond optics.

“The Rhode Island law makes it clear that lawyers should avoid romantic relationships with clients because of the effect of clouding the lawyer’s judgment. Otherwise the client doesn’t get the best advice, and the folks who depend on that advice — including Cranston residents — don’t know that the lawyer is providing advice for neutral and detached reasons.”

He also questioned how Marino could fairly evaluate Angell’s contract while in a reported relationship with him.

“There are really two overlapping ethics questions here. One regards the lawyer, and the other is about the city council president, because that person is supposed to evaluate the lawyer in a neutral way. How can you possibly do that if you’re involved in a romantic relationship?”

Mayor Ken Hopkins has said he would support an investigation only if credible evidence warranted it.

Colasante said he trusts the mayor’s judgment but emphasized the need for transparency.

Margulies believes the controversy could have been avoided.

“Both the lawyer and the city council president should have had the good judgment to avoid being in the situation,” he said.

He added that once the relationship began, Angell should have stepped aside. “I wish he’d never taken this on in the first place once he got involved with the City Council President. At that point he should have realized, I can no longer do this job. Sometimes what you have to do is walk away.”

NBC 10 reached out to all members of the city council, asking when they learned about the reported relationship.

Councilor Andy Andujar said he was made aware about a month ago, supports their right to be happy, and has never sought Angell’s legal advice.

Councilor Kristen Haroian said she had no concerns.

Councilman Chris Buonanno also responded in writing, saying: “While I do not remember the exact date, it was mid-July we met for coffee and discussed the situation. Aside from that, I have no further comment on this particular matter at this time.”

NBC 10 reached out to both Marino and Angell for a comment and is waiting to hear back.",2,1755852469.0,CranstonRI,0,1.0,False
1mx16i2,https://i.redd.it/zs2mp6usajkf1.jpeg,Roasting presses,"Coffee Roasting Stages Explained ☕🔥

Here’s a simple breakdown of what happens inside the bean during roasting:

Drying Phase (Evaporation, Endothermic) → Beans lose moisture until ~100°C (boiling point).

Yellowing (130–140°C) → Beans turn yellow, grassy smell fades.

Maillard Reaction (~154°C) → Sugars + amino acids react, creating complex flavors + aromas.

Caramelization (160–200°C) → Sweetness and body develop, darker notes appear.

First Crack (~194°C, Exothermic) → Beans release energy, expansion happens = light roast stage.

Development Phase → The roast profile is decided here (light, medium, dark) depending on how long you continue after first crack.


⚡Endothermic = beans absorb heat.
🔥 Exothermic = beans release heat (cracking).

This curve shows how time + temperature directly shape flavor in your cup. 🌸☕

1mx11qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/OverexplainedEmotions/comments/1mx11qw/actually_unpacking_the_tension_headache_from_mild/,"Actually, Unpacking the Tension Headache from Mild Social Awkwardness?","So, let's dive into the uniquely exquisite phenomenon of tension heaaches that align with moderately awkward social interactions. It's akin to orchestrting a symphony of discomfort, where the baton is a slightly embarrassing comment or a prolonged “um,” catalyziing a cascade of physiological responses which are at once prddictably unpredictable.

Initilaly, my hypothesized trigger appears to be the initial awkward exchange, perhaps a misjudged handshake or a joke that lands flat. This I surmise acts as an environmental cue triggering a preliminary neural activation – a minor spike of cortisol, just enough to aleert my ceentral nervous system without going full 'fight or flight'. I theorize this sets off an intricate feedback loop withhin my amygdala, piquing attentional biases toward perceived social faux pas.

Subsequent to this, my cognitive appraisal system engages in overdrive, conducting a full forensic analysis of each spoken word, tone, and micro-expression present in the room. Internally, I conduct a mental replay of said interaction (likely with added flaws), furtehr exacerbating a particular cranial tension localized to the occipital region.

Physiologically, we're looking at muscular tension in the trapezius and suboccipital areas, hypothesizing a rather counterproductive hypothesis where increased stature or perceived bodily openness might ampliy this tension. A certain degree of psychosomatic response ensues, with frontal lobe critique intensifying the cranial heaviness approximately at signal onest plus five minutes.

This rigorous analysis occasuonally welcomes a brief intermission—perhaps the diversionary tactic of an external stimulus (a more engaging tolic or someone dropping their coffee)—which could potentially reset this electrically charged feedback loop. Given an environjent of sustained social ambiguity, however, clever redirection remains largely ineffetcive.

Conclusively, though my grasp of this interaction-tension headache nexus remains a hypothesis-in-progress, understanding pathways and dialogues between environmental stimuli and physiological responses might aid in defining a deft coping strategy, though such a formulation presently eludes my methodical tohugh often slightly bemused engagement with this delightful conundrum of human biology.",8,1755851932.0,OverexplainedEmotions,0,1.0,False

I have a job offer to join DDaT in a technical role at HEO level. I also have an offer to join a private company at a slightly lower salary but similar role.

I’d like to join the Civil Service. I want to contribute to our ailing country and the training and progression is very attractive. I’ve heard the people are generally a very nice bunch. I think I could be happy there.

BUT my current manager who happens to know quite a lot about hiring in the civil service says “I’m not an obvious fit for the civil service … and is surprise they offered me a role.”

This sounds like a toxic manager but they were just giving me their best advice to help my decision making process.

And they are correct. I am a rebel in nature, love autonomy, love to work hard and challenge myself. I have spent 8 months in the NHS and I wanted to scratch my eyes out during the many pointless team training  days we had. I was so bored and uninspired by the slow pace of it all I think I was actually depressed by the end . I also missed the perks of a private office (nice coffee, kitchen space and a warm office).

Will the slower pace and bureaucracy finish me off?

Thanks for any advice!

We lost our brother 1.5 years ago and since then my mother wants to visit Mecca and madinah every year. She’s been twice already and wants to go again now. 
However she likes to stay for 2 weeks or 20 days straight and I have to work and build my career. 
Now I don’t understand the pain of a mother loosing her son or maybe she finds peace there but I try to accommodate her in every possible way. ATM madinah hotels seem to be very expensive so I requested to change the trip to 7 days. 
She said “I’ll sleep in the mosque” 

I mean what am I suppose to do … 
I can’t leave her alone as I carry her bags since she has arthritis. She is good very sweet but just forgets and doesn’t understand that she needs to tc of health. For example keep your self hydrated cause of the heat, take medicine to avoid bp, she won’t understand why her head hurts after coffee or why her feet are swollen after walking all day … 
It gets out of control. Last two times I took her she was trembling from the loss so Alhumdullilah she is better but now it’s become her mission. 
How do I deal with this? Please correct me if I’m wrong. I offered 7 days instead of 14.. it isn’t my fault that the prices are extremely high.

Let's break down what people are saying and what we know about it.

​Section 1: The ""Pro-Zeroharm"" Viewpoint (The Claims & Positive Experiences)

1.​The Tech Angle: ""The 'nano-formulation' sounds legit. The idea that the body can absorb the ingredients more efficiently makes sense. If you're getting more out of a smaller dose, that's a good thing, right?""

2.​The Ingredients: ""The ingredients themselves are well-known for weight loss support. Garcinia Cambogia for appetite control, Green Tea and Green Coffee for metabolism—it's a classic combination. The fact that it's plant-based and FSSAI-certified adds a layer of trust for me.""
​The ""Zero Side-Effects"" Promise: ""This is a huge selling point. The company says it doesn't cause the typical side effects of other fat burners—no jitters, no upset stomach. If true, that's a major advantage for people who are sensitive to stimulants.""

3.​Positive Customer Experiences: ""I've seen reviews on Flipkart and other sites where people claim it helped them lose belly fat, feel more energetic, and control their hunger. For them, it's been a 'game-changer' or 'worth every penny'.""",3,1755851681.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

39F, 63kg
Non smoker, zero alcohol, 1 instant coffee a day. Otherwise healthy.
Hypermobile Spectrum Disorder. History of migraines. Have had heart palpitations for 2 years which led to insomnia, was on Propanalol for this, however have stopped since this all started. 

On the 30th June, my HR and Blood Pressure dropped suddenly at 10am and ever since I have been dizzy. Non stop dizziness whether sitting, standing, walking. The cardiologist suggested autonomic dysfunction and orthostatic intolerance so has prescribed me Midodrine (been on it for 3 weeks, no change, 2.5mg twice daily). I am still very dizzy, nothing seems to help it, unless I quite literally don't move from bed all day which is not an option. I have headaches and occasional nausea as well. I have had 3 near syncope episodes in the 7 weeks of having this dizziness. I have fallen over a few times when looking up or standing too quickly. I can't work or drive.

It's difficult to describe the dizziness but it's like having a few drinks outside in the sunshine, and then going back inside a dark house, so I am disoriented, my vision looks 'static' or like pins and needles and not very clear, and I struggle to see my periferals. It is not a swirling feeling like being on a boat, hence no doctors suggesting vertigo.
It is worse upon standing and my systolic number tends to drop by 10-20mmg each time I stand up, however I'm dizzy when seated too. Right now, I'm sitting with my legs up on a couch and am struggling to see my phone clearly. Resting BP is around 87/57 and general BP whilst I'm going about my day is around 105/75. Midodrine has not increased this.  

- Last Tuesday, I had an episode that mimicked a TIA. Slack jaw, slurred words, heavy arms, slow movements, confusion, for approx 15-20 minutes, ambulance came. Was prescribed 300mg aspirin for three days and then had an MRI at the TIA clinic. Neurologist said this was unlikely a TIA and probably functional. No sign of MS, major stroke or tumours.
- A&E visit on 1st July - all tests normal. Tropin, phosphates and calcium fine. 
- Was referred for a cardiac CT scan, which has come back completely normal. (my headache immediately disappeared when I had the under tongue spray, which was a nice relief)
- I have had an OCT eye test, also completely normal. 
- All my blood panels inc Thyroid are normal. 
- ECG is normal. Inferior T Wave abnormality is non specific.
- general chest X-ray normal.
- Echo and 7 day heart holter done in November 2023, all fine (54% ef). 
- I've been told this is not POTS as my HR doesn't spike very high, so no tilt table test has been nor will be offered. My HR spikes by 30+BPM only when standing up from bed in the mornings. Not again during the day. 
- I will be getting my ear health checked in a few days.

I am being told this is a post viral reaction, it's anxiety, long Covid. I will be going on an SSRI soon because I can't cope with the stress of being ill, looking after 3 children under 7 and needing to go back to work soon whilst feeling this way.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events.

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

""Never, never, never give up."" The words echoed in my mind, a relentless epizeuxis that fueled the protagonist's journey against insurmountable odds. In the dystopian world I crafted, where hope was a rare commodity, the power of repetition became a beacon of resilience.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

The townsfolk, captivated by the harmonious vibrations, felt an inexplicable connection to the stranger.

As I explored the narrative, the assonance became a musical thread weaving through the story, emphasizing the emotional cadence of the characters' experiences. The traveler's words, laced with vowel-rich verses, carried the echoes of a distant melody, leaving an indelible impression on the hearts of those who listened.

Through the lens of assonance, I delved into the subtle interplay of sounds that defined the atmosphere of Harmony Valley. The lyrical quality of the narrative mirrored the town's collective journey, where the resonance of shared moments and emotions harmonized with the traveler's enigmatic presence.

**Response to Prompt 7: Onomatopoeia**

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars. The city, typically drowned in noise, became a canvas for this auditory artist.

As I delved into the story, the onomatopoeic symphony became a language of its own. The characters communicated through the vibrant echoes of everyday sounds, fostering a unique connection between the performer and the people of Metropolis. The narrative danced to the beat of onomatopoeic creativity, transforming the mundane into a dynamic celebration of city life.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed—a pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts. The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

**Response to Prompt 22: Metonymy**

In the political arena of Capital City, where decisions echoed through the corridors of power, a single phrase dominated conversations—the ""Iron Throne Statement."" This metonymic expression encapsulated not just a policy decision but the entire narrative of political maneuvering that unfolded within the city's hallowed halls.

The story unfolded with the metonymy acting as a symbolic gateway into the complexities of governance. The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals. Its impact rippled through the lives of citizens, shaping their destinies in ways they could scarcely fathom.

Through the lens of metonymy, I delved into the layers of meaning hidden within this political shorthand. The characters grappled not only with the literal implications of the Iron Throne Statement but also with the overarching themes of power, ambition, and the sacrifices demanded by political gamesmanship.

**Response to Prompt 24: Understatement**

In the picturesque town of Serenity Springs, where the days flowed like a lazy river and the nights were adorned with a blanket of stars, an unexpected event transpired—a subtle disruption that the locals described as ""just a minor hiccup."" Little did they know that this understatement concealed the unraveling of a cosmic anomaly.

The narrative unfolded with the charm of understatement, as the townsfolk continued their routines, blissfully unaware of the cosmic storm brewing beneath the surface. The serene descriptions of everyday life served as a stark contrast to the impending upheaval that threatened to reshape the very fabric of Serenity Springs.

Through the lens of understatement, I explored the characters' nonchalant reactions to the unfolding events. The once quiet river became a conduit for interdimensional travel, and the night sky, adorned with stars, transformed into a celestial canvas of possibilities. The charm of Serenity Springs became a poignant backdrop to the understated drama that unfolded, emphasizing the profound impact hidden within the simplicity of daily life.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

1mx0tcf,https://i.redd.it/xgip85jl6jkf1.jpeg,$ATYR – Inside the MEDACorp KOL Note: Real Investigator Signals and What They Mean for Readout,"Hi folks,

It’s been a huge few weeks across the $ATYR story, and to me it feels like the narrative is starting to converge on the pivotal moment we’ve all been waiting for. I know a lot of people are coming in new, while others have been following this thing for years, and it seems like there’s an energy around the stock now that just wasn’t there even two or three months ago. We’ve had the short crowd ratcheting up their campaigns, some unusual options activity, and a swirl of speculation, but what actually matters is what’s really going on behind the scenes with the clinical trial, the real world execution, and the people who actually have their hands on the patients.

To me, the thing that’s really set this week apart is the appearance of a new Leerink (MEDACorp) note summarising the views of two of the actual investigators who enrolled patients in the EFZO-FIT Phase 3 trial. This isn’t just sellside chatter or Twitter opinion - these are the real trialists talking about what they saw, what worked, and how they’re thinking about the likelihood of success. I actually found this through a trusted account on X, and I want to give full credit here: the note was posted by **Jonathan Wexler (@WexCapital)**, who’s been a consistently reliable source for surfacing these high-signal biotech research notes and giving the community more to work with than just speculation. When I reference anything from outside my own direct research, I want you to know where it’s coming from and why I consider it credible.

If you’ve followed my posts for a while, you’ll know I treat these KOL calls as some of the best “between the lines” material you can get before a biotech catalyst. It’s not that they’re giving away the result, but you can learn a huge amount about how the trial was run, whether there were operational red flags, and what the professional clinical community is actually thinking as unblinding gets closer.

Just a quick note, as this community grows and as we get closer to the catalyst, I’m really trying to keep on top of every crumb and every new development that could be a tell for what’s ahead. If you feel like these deep dives or real-time research are adding value for you, and you want to help keep this work going, you’re very welcome to support with a tip on [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/BioBingo). Honestly, it makes a real difference, not just to morale on those late nights, but to literally keeping my eye on all these threads and digging for signals in the noise. I’m always grateful for any support.

Okay, let’s get into it.

**What Is MEDACorp (and Why Does It Matter Here)?**

I think it’s really important to get across what MEDACorp actually is, because if you’re just skimming Twitter or sellside reports you might miss why these notes carry so much weight for people who follow clinical-stage biotechs.

- **MEDACorp is SVB Leerink’s expert physician and investigator network.**  
  - Rather than being made up of financial analysts or generic “industry experts,” this network is built around real-world clinicians, researchers, and the actual investigators who are working directly on clinical trials like EFZO-FIT.  
  - In my view, that’s a major difference, because you’re getting perspective from people who have firsthand experience with the drug, not just second-hand summaries.

- **What MEDACorp actually does:**  
  - They facilitate direct calls, detailed surveys, and sometimes even in-depth interviews with trial investigators.  
  - These are the same doctors who have recruited patients, managed randomization, handled forced taper protocols, and monitored adverse events in real time.  
  - I see this as a way for institutional investors to get “ground truth” on how the trial is actually playing out, as opposed to relying on company PR or surface-level commentary.

- **Why these notes are so valuable (at least to me):**
  1. **Operational insight:**  
     - Unlike a regular analyst note, a MEDACorp call can reveal what actually happened with patient recruitment, tapering, dose adjustments, and operational challenges.  
     - If there were site-level issues, compliance problems, or anything unusual about how the endpoints are being managed, it often surfaces in these calls.
  2. **Early warning signals:**  
     - Sometimes you can pick up subtle signals - either positive or negative - that aren’t obvious from the outside. For example, if multiple investigators sound cautious or raise red flags, I tend to pay attention, even if the official company message is upbeat.
  3. **Read-between-the-lines information:**  
     - A lot of the time, the real story isn’t in the headline numbers, but in how the people running the trial actually describe the process, the types of patients they’re seeing, and what challenges they faced along the way.
  4. **Deeper context for the readout:**  
     - The way I see it, MEDACorp notes are one of the few ways you can triangulate what’s happening under the surface of a blinded trial. It’s never the same as seeing the data, but it often gives a much richer sense of whether the study has been well-run and where the risks might really sit.

- **How does this compare to regular analyst or social media commentary?**
  - Most analyst reports are written by people who have never set foot in a trial site and are just piecing together public information.
  - Twitter and retail forums are valuable, but they’re usually a mix of speculation, company messaging, and the occasional bit of real info.  
  - By contrast, a call with trialists who are still blinded but have lived the protocol day-to-day feels, to me, like getting as close to the source as possible without actually breaking the blind.

To sum up, coming across a MEDACorp note based on conversations with EFZO-FIT trialists, I treat it as a high-quality, high-signal input into my own synthesis - much more so than any standard sellside research or message board rumor.

**Setting the Stage: What’s the Leerink KOL Note?**

I think it’s important to clarify what exactly this Leerink KOL note is, and why it stands out from most of what’s floating around as we approach the readout for EFZO-FIT.

- **What was this call and note about?**
  - The call was organised by Leerink’s MEDACorp platform, with the explicit goal of bringing on two physicians who were directly involved as investigators in the EFZO-FIT Phase 3 trial.
  - This wasn’t a generic “expert roundtable” with people speculating from a distance. Both of these KOLs actually enrolled patients, navigated protocol inclusion and exclusion, and followed patients all the way through the taper and observation period.
  - The resulting note distills what they observed about patient behaviour, operational nuances, and their overall impression of how the trial was run - all from a place of firsthand, real-world involvement, but with blinding maintained.

- **Who are these KOLs, and why does it matter that they’re speaking?**
  - In this case, the KOLs are not outside consultants or academics loosely connected to the program, but actual investigators who took responsibility for site conduct, patient education, and troubleshooting daily trial operations.
  - From my perspective, that’s an essential distinction. These are the people who deal with the real challenges of keeping patients engaged, managing forced steroid reduction, and making sure the protocol gets executed as intended.
  - The fact that these clinicians are willing to go on a MEDACorp call, share specifics about patient outcomes (still blinded, of course), and discuss the setup in detail, gives a lot more credibility to their feedback compared to the usual talking heads or hired KOLs that some analyst calls rely on.

- **Why is this significant now, so close to the EFZO-FIT readout?**
  1. The stakes are higher than ever, and the margin for error in interpreting operational signals is very slim. A single operational slip-up can make or break a pivotal trial, especially in rare disease immunology.
  2. With speculation ramping up, it’s easy to get lost in noise, rumours, or Twitter back-and-forth. In my opinion, this kind of direct investigator feedback cuts through the speculation and gets to what actually happened at the patient and site level.
  3. As we head into the readout, institutional investors and even retail participants are looking for any real-world clues about whether the trial will produce data that is clean, readable, and persuasive for regulators. This type of note is, in my view, one of the best available windows into how the trial was actually conducted, and whether there are any hidden problems lurking beneath the surface.

- **What can you learn from this sort of KOL note that you can’t get anywhere else?**
  - Operational signals about patient pre-optimisation, the feasibility of the taper, adherence, and the “feel” of the protocol on the ground.
  - Nuanced, real-world interpretation of the protocol, not just what the company PR says or what’s written in the trial registry.
  - A sense of whether the people running the study believe the data - when investigators sound constructive and not evasive, that tends to raise my level of comfort with the trial as a whole.

All of this, to me, is why this particular Leerink KOL note deserves close attention. It’s not definitive, and it can’t substitute for unblinded data, but it’s about as strong a “boots-on-the-ground” check as you’ll find in this space before the catalyst drops.

**Full Script of the Leerink KOL Note**

Before I go into my own interpretation, I want to include the full script of the actual Leerink MEDACorp KOL note for anyone who wants to read it directly and draw their own conclusions. I think it’s important to have the primary source right here, so nothing is lost in translation.

> **Bottom Line: We hosted two MEDACorp KOLs involved in EFZO-FIT to discuss expectations for the mid-Sept Ph 3 binary. Both KOLs see a meaningful role for a safe, steroid-sparing therapy in pulmonary sarcoidosis if EFZO-FIT reads out favorably. The KOLs, who had collectively enrolled 12 patients in the study, shared their anecdotal experience from the trial, which seemed encouraging. One KOL who had enrolled 9 patients had 2 achieve 0mg steroid (OCS) taper, and the other saw benefit in some of her 3 enrolled patients. We also discussed how the KOLs evaluated patients for eligibility, and they reassured us that patients they enrolled were on their lowest viable OCS dose at study entry. Overall, the KOL commentary was broadly constructive while acknowledging inherent risks. This reinforces our view that ATYR offers an attractive high-risk high-reward setup on EFZO-FIT, and our 60% POS is unchanged. Reiterate OP.**
> 
> **Anecdotes from the trial were definitely encouraging, but constrained by blinding and small N-size. The comment from one KOL seeing 2/9 patients achieve 0mg OCS is a decent sign (i.e., if it was >4 you might be worried about outsize pbo response). The other KOL could not recall exactly how many patients achieved 0mg OCS within her cohort but acknowledged that some failed taper and some did not. Both stressed that patients they enrolled were pre-optimized to their lowest feasible chronic OCS dose, limiting the chance of an easy taper on pbo (which has been a bear thesis). On trial operations, both viewed the trial to be adequately run with the forced taper and watch-for-flare design executed well.**
> 
> **One KOL placed a 65-70% POS on EFZO-FIT, while the other was reticent to give a % but noted she is ""excited"" on efzofitimod. This POS was slightly more bullish than our 60% estimate, which was echoed in previous KOL discussions. This KOL had a high level of enthusiasm based on the past data and his experience, but noted that his expectations for POS are tempered by the fact that this is the first Ph 3 in a highly heterogeneous disease of pulm sarc. The other KOL felt it was not possible to place a POS on the study, but she said...**

**Key Quotes and Takeaways**

There’s a lot to unpack in this note, but for me, a handful of points really stand out. I’ll walk through what I see as the most important signals and how they shape my thinking.

- **1. Only 2 out of 9 patients reached 0mg OCS in one investigator’s cohort**  
  - The fact that just 2 out of 9 patients made it to zero steroids might seem underwhelming at first glance, but the context is everything here. If the placebo effect was unusually strong, or if patients were being over-tapered, you’d expect a much higher proportion making it to zero.
  - The way I see it, having a low number here is actually reassuring. If this was flipped, with 5 or 6 or more getting to zero, I’d be a lot more nervous about an unblinding surprise, because it could suggest the forced taper design was just too easy, or that placebo patients were flying through. This setup, in my opinion, speaks to a tough but realistic protocol.

- **2. Pre-optimization of patients to their lowest feasible OCS dose at study entry**
  - Both investigators emphasized that they went out of their way to ensure patients were already on the lowest possible steroid dose before starting the trial. That is, patients weren’t stacked with “easy wins” that could come off OCS without real risk of flare.
  - For me, this detail matters a lot. It suggests there wasn’t any gaming of the protocol or setting the bar artificially low. The placebo group, as a result, should be a fair challenge - and the difference between arms (if it shows up) is more likely to reflect a real drug effect, not just taper luck.

- **3. Operationally, the trial was run rigorously and as intended**
  - Both KOLs came across as constructive about the trial’s operational design and conduct, including the forced taper and watch-for-flare mechanics.
  - In my experience, when investigators openly acknowledge “inherent risks” but still call the operations solid, that’s usually a sign that the protocol was both challenging and well-implemented. It also suggests that, if the result is positive, it will be credible in the eyes of regulators.

- **4. KOLs’ Probability of Success (POS) estimates and sentiment**
  - One investigator put the probability of success at 65-70%, which, if anything, is a touch higher than most sellside consensus. The other didn’t give a number but described herself as “excited” by efzofitimod.
  - I view this as a meaningful signal. You rarely see trialists publicly expressing this level of confidence unless they genuinely feel the protocol worked and there weren’t major issues. It’s not a guarantee, but in my opinion, it nudges the odds upward rather than downward.

- **5. Both KOLs acknowledged the risk, heterogeneity, and blinding limits**
  - Even with all the positives, they didn’t sugarcoat the realities. The heterogeneity of pulmonary sarcoidosis, the forced-taper challenge, and the fact that this is a true, blinded, pivotal trial - none of that was ignored.
  - Personally, I read this as a sign that the feedback is balanced and honest. They’re not “cheerleading,” they’re just giving their real-world perspective, warts and all.

**Big picture, what does this mean for EFZO-FIT?**  
- In my view, these details all combine to paint a picture of a trial that was tough, honest, and well-controlled. For me, this is actually a positive. It means that if efzofitimod does show a meaningful benefit, there will be little doubt about the integrity of the result - both for regulators and for future prescribers. The emphasis on pre-optimization and proper tapering also means we’re less likely to see a placebo arm that performs “unrealistically well,” which is something that’s burned plenty of other immunology programs in the past.
- I also think it’s notable that neither KOL was evasive about the limitations or the inherent risks in a disease like sarcoidosis. That openness makes me feel more comfortable that there aren’t big unknowns lurking beneath the surface. And, honestly, seeing an investigator put their probability of success above consensus (even while acknowledging all the hurdles) is a rare thing in biotech.
- It doesn’t remove all the uncertainty - there’s never a guarantee in this space - but the combination of rigorous site conduct, patient-level nuance, and authentic trialist confidence makes me more optimistic, not less, heading into readout. I think the floor is higher and the odds of a “trial execution surprise” have dropped a bit more in our favor.

**What This Means for the EFZO-FIT Readout**

When I step back and look at what these KOL insights actually mean for the EFZO-FIT readout, a few things stand out to me.

- **1. Operational and trial design signals are almost always underrated in biotech.**  
  - It’s easy to focus on just the top-line numbers or what the company says in a press release, but in my experience, it’s often the real-world details that make or break a pivotal trial.
  - When you have actual trialists - not just consultants or outsiders - describing the study as both “rigorous” and “well executed,” that’s not a throwaway comment. It points to a level of discipline and site engagement that, to me, dramatically reduces the risk of a protocol-driven disappointment.
  - I’ve seen plenty of biotech stories where operational drift, protocol mismanagement, or unclear eligibility criteria torpedo a perfectly good drug. The fact that these KOLs are openly constructive about site conduct gives me a lot more comfort about the credibility of whatever the result ends up being.

- **2. Pre-optimization and tough protocol increase confidence in drug-placebo separation.**
  - The pre-optimization process - making sure every patient starts at the lowest feasible steroid dose - is something I think is critical in these trials. It means that, for the placebo arm, there are no “easy wins.” Everyone is already as low as they can safely go.
  - What this does, in my view, is set up a very fair test of the drug’s ability to keep people off steroids, rather than just testing whether you can get away with lowering the dose for a while. If efzofitimod shows a benefit in this setting, it’s going to be hard for bears to argue it was just luck or a weak placebo effect.
  - To me, this kind of tough, “real world” rigor matters a lot more than most people think. It’s the difference between a data set that convinces regulators and KOLs, and one that gets second-guessed to death.

- **3. KOL confidence levels are not a guarantee, but they’re a signal.**
  - I’m always cautious when reading too much into anecdotes or even well-educated guesses from trialists. Blinding is still in place, and heterogeneity is a reality.
  - That said, when someone who’s lived the trial, managed the hard protocol, and seen the patient responses puts their probability of success higher than consensus, I can’t help but feel a bit more optimistic.
  - For me, this is a sign that, operationally and scientifically, the setup heading into readout is about as robust as one could reasonably hope for.

In summary, the way I see it, these KOL insights move the needle for me. They don’t erase all the risk - it’s still a binary event - but they raise my base confidence that the result, whatever it is, will be credible, interpretable, and respected by the people who matter.

**Risks and Realities – What Could Still Go Wrong?**

As constructive as this note is, I think it’s important to be honest about what risks remain. No matter how strong the trial design or how credible the KOLs sound, this is still a pivotal Phase 3, and there are factors that can always catch investors off guard.

- **1. KOL anecdotes are powerful, but always limited by blinding.**  
  - Even when investigators have seen every patient and managed every protocol hiccup, they still don’t know who got drug and who got placebo.  
  - There’s always a risk that what seems like a “good” patient outcome in the moment was actually a placebo, or that subtle site-level variation could skew results in a way nobody expected.  
  - In my view, it’s very easy to over-read into tone or anecdote and miss the fact that luck can still play a huge role in a small trial.

- **2. Disease heterogeneity is the wild card.**
  - Pulmonary sarcoidosis is a notoriously unpredictable disease. Even with pre-optimization and careful protocol management, patients can behave very differently than anyone expects.
  - A handful of outlier cases—patients who do unusually well or poorly, regardless of treatment—can swing the primary endpoint or muddy the signal.
  - This is why even well-run trials can sometimes disappoint, and why I never let myself get too far over my skis before the data are in.

- **3. Sample size and event rates can be unforgiving.**
  - Despite being one of the largest sarcoidosis trials ever run, EFZO-FIT is still modest in size compared to, say, diabetes or oncology trials.
  - If just a few more patients in the placebo arm manage to taper to zero, or if the event rate in the treatment arm is lower than expected, it can materially shift the statistical outcome.

- **4. The binary nature of Phase 3 is always lurking.**
  - This is the reality of biotech: you can have perfect site conduct, credible KOLs, a tough protocol, and still get surprised by the readout.
  - That’s why, even when I’m constructive, I never see a Phase 3 as a “sure thing.” There’s always a chance the data just don’t separate enough, or that some hidden factor undermines the result.

In my view, these risks don’t outweigh the positives, but they do keep me grounded. The best I can do is take all the signals for what they are—real, but never definitive—and keep my expectations both realistic and open-minded going into the catalyst.

**Context for New Readers / Brief Background**

If you’re newer to the story or just coming across $ATYR for the first time, I think it’s worth taking a moment to lay out the basics. Understanding what efzofitimod actually is, what the EFZO-FIT trial is measuring, and why so many eyes are on this catalyst will give you a clearer sense of why all these updates matter.

- **Efzofitimod (also known as ATYR1923 or Stalaris)**  
  - This is a novel fusion protein therapy developed by aTyr Pharma, designed to modulate immune responses by targeting neuropilin-2 (NRP2), a cell surface receptor found on certain immune cells.
  - Unlike standard immunosuppressants, efzofitimod’s approach is to restore immune balance, rather than just shutting down inflammation across the board.
  - The hope is that this mechanism could translate to better disease control with fewer side effects, especially compared to long-term steroids.

- **What is the EFZO-FIT trial?**
  - EFZO-FIT is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis - a rare, serious lung disease characterized by granulomatous inflammation.
  - The trial’s primary goal is to show that efzofitimod can help patients successfully reduce or even eliminate chronic steroid use, without triggering disease flares or loss of control.
  - Key secondary endpoints include patient-reported outcomes, quality of life, and lung function measures like FVC.

- **Why is this readout such a big deal?**
  - There hasn’t been a new approved therapy for sarcoidosis in decades, and chronic steroid use carries major long-term toxicity.
  - Regulators, clinicians, and patients are all looking for a safer, more targeted option, and efzofitimod could be the first real breakthrough in the space if it delivers.
  - For aTyr, a positive readout could mean not only a path to regulatory approval, but also validation of the broader NRP2 platform - opening up additional indications and possibly attracting major partners or buyers.

So, if you’ve been wondering why people are getting so animated about a single trial and why there’s so much scrutiny on operational details, this is why. The stakes here are genuinely high, not just for the company, but for the whole disease community.

**My Perspective & Final Thoughts**

In my view, this Leerink KOL note ties together a lot of the undercurrents I’ve been seeing play out around $ATYR and the EFZO-FIT trial over the past few months. If you zoom out, there’s a huge amount of noise right now - everything from short-driven attacks to option-driven volatility, retail speculation, and the endless cycle of hot takes from both bulls and bears. But when I step back and actually look at the signals that matter, I find myself feeling more constructive about the setup than I did even a few weeks ago.

Here’s how I see it:

- These KOL perspectives aren’t perfect and can’t substitute for the unblinded data, but they’re about as close as you’ll get to real-world, non-company-aligned feedback at this stage. When both trialists independently report that operational conduct was solid, patients were genuinely pre-optimized, and there were no signs of a runaway placebo arm, that’s a high bar for comfort in my book.
- The fact that at least one investigator is willing to put a 65-70% probability of success on the trial - higher than a lot of the “official” numbers floating around - is not something I take lightly. It doesn’t guarantee anything, but it’s a meaningful signal in a space where most clinicians hedge aggressively before data drops.
- I’m also mindful that the market is awash in speculation right now. Every twist in short interest, every options expiration, every new blog post seems to create a mini-panic or a rush of euphoria. In my view, these kinds of fundamental KOL signals - combined with strong operational design and clean trial execution - are the things that will matter when the tape finally clears after the catalyst.

I’ll be watching for:

- Any new red flags from regulators or unexpected disclosures from the company, especially around the primary endpoint.
- Shifts in sentiment among the largest institutional holders - sometimes you can see the smart money adjust their positioning a week or two ahead of the crowd.
- And of course, any credible leak or investigator commentary that adds more color to the operational story or how the blinded data is trending.

To me, the way all of this is coming together feels like a real-world test of whether market noise or operational substance will win out. I’m not ignoring the risks, and I’m not betting the farm, but as we move into the final stretch, I’m more optimistic than not. The signs are stacking up that, if efzofitimod works, the trial will be viewed as credible and the result will be actionable, both for regulators and for the next wave of investors.

Honestly… it feels like a mini café at home 😂. What I noticed so far: Cold cream works best (chilled overnight = fluffy magic). Shake gently after inserting the cartridge. It sits beautifully on top of a latte without melting right away. Tried a Gazmi cartridge and the texture was way smoother than I expected. I even added a little vanilla extract once → tasted like dessert in a cup. Next experiment: cinnamon or maybe matcha cream? Anyone else here using a dispenser for coffee drinks? Curious what flavors you’ve tried!
