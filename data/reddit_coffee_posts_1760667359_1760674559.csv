I‚Äôm 37 years old with no kids (I can‚Äôt have any) and I‚Äôll start by saying I‚Äôm in a relationship, but it feels like I‚Äôm completely alone mentally, emotionally, even physically. I‚Äôve been there relationship for almost 7.5 years, and I would love to get married someday, but I don‚Äôt think my partner is planning on that, not even a little bit. I live in Colorado on the front range working remotely in a career that I love, but has been rocky for the last 3 years to say the least. I‚Äôm not really proud of myself for coming here for companionship while being in a relationship, let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs complicated and I‚Äôm kind of at my wits end. I want to believe that I‚Äôm a good person with a good heart, but my partner makes me feel otherwise. I am in therapy, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping much for as much as it is costing me. I‚Äôm going to be upfront and say I have a lot going on for me, financially, career wise, relationship wise‚Ä¶..sorry. I really am trying my best to get to a good place in my life, but I honestly do feel very alone. 

I just want to feel fully loved, truly loved. Like, truly for better or for worse loved. I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs possible anymore. I‚Äôm not very hard to please, at least I don‚Äôt think I am. I like simple things like rainy days, even the sound of rain, coffee runs, audiobooks and a good Netflix series. I‚Äôm definitely an introvert so I‚Äôm not really into doing things outdoors, even though I‚Äôm in Colorado. I know, it‚Äôs surprising. 
 
I‚Äôm just looking to get to know someone as a deep friendship, a lot of people on here seem to go pretty easily and I would love it if I could find someone who doesn‚Äôt. So if you‚Äôre truly, wholeheartedly interested feel free to message me and I‚Äôd love to see if I can help you in your struggles too.

nowadays, i'm keeping things grounded (mostly). i use a mix of zapier and notion to keep the chaos at bay. tried hypeCaster.ai too, which became a nifty sidekick for creating quick clip content when i needed to ditch the face cam. it's been quite the ride, but funnily enough, the simpler my systems, the less they explode.

Made an orange air one time. 100ml orange juice and 1% liquid soy lecithin. Made the bubbles with an unused (haha) aquarium filter contraption thing.

And an orange foam the other. Just the the way I made the bubbles was different in this case. I used a coffee frother. And the foam was tighter (for lack of a better word) bubbles.

In both cases. Beautiful.

I'm really confused about it all though. 

I'm on 10 mg XR and the first two days felt fantastic but since then (it's been almost 2 weeks) I've been utterly fatigued. And it's not from a crash, because the fatigue is all day.  I've had an increase in executive dysfunction. That didn't happen last time I was on Adderall.

Today was the worst, I felt so horrible like my soul was getting sucked out of me I couldn't function at all. I had so many tasks to do today that i just sat in front of for over an hour before I could do it, and I struggled to be present with my kid at all, to the point of tears and anger for both of us. 
I took my Adderall first thing in the morning and felt like I could sleep for 12 hours straight. Only after I made myself two cups of coffee in the afternoon did my energy pick up and I could do anything at all. 

I'm not eating or drinking anything acidic and I'm pretty good on sleep. I do take it the Adderall on an empty stomach sometimes because I rush my mornings so maybe that's the problem? I'm very confused about what's going on and wondering if I should push through, see if my body adjusts, or if I need to do other things to make it work better?

My old provider didn't throttle well on public nets, stuttering without adaptive quality and forcing me to switch to data plans mid-break. I was limiting to audio-only as a workaround until I tested IPTV Providers( [https://www.reddit.com/r/AuroraIPTV/wiki/index/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AuroraIPTV/wiki/index/)  ), and switching to their low-bandwidth live mode plus refreshing the WiFi connection smoothed the streams‚Äîno choppiness, and feeds play steady now.

I‚Äôve already done gift cards to local caf√©s, so I‚Äôm hoping to find something that feels a bit more personal or unique this time. Maybe something that helps them enjoy their coffee ritual even more, or a fun surprise they wouldn‚Äôt think to get themselves.

1o8r8bg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o8r8bg,Get Superlost,"This post is long overdue. I‚Äôve touted Superlost Coffee tons of times across various ‚Äúwhat subscription should I get?‚Äù posts. Now, I‚Äôm finally giving them, their beans, and their subscription the dedicated post they deserve.

My love for Superlost goes back to Christmas 2024 and their Coffee of the Moment (COTM) number 11. 

I‚Äôve been doing pour overs for years now, but I‚Äôd never really taken the beans that serious until I asked for a bag of Superlost on a whim, and got COTM 11. 

I missed out on COTM 12-15 before getting myself a birthday subscription in March. I‚Äôve now enjoyed a pound of Superlost beans every month since April (for an easy ~$22, total steal!!!) 

I‚Äôve been brewing a ton of coffee the past 5-6 months. It‚Äôs such a treat having Superlost to fall back on‚Ä¶if not blown away everything else in my drawer (looking at you YCA Community blend!) 

I bought from them on top of my subscription for the first time last week. I got a special bag of their Sebastian Ramirez carbonic maceration caturra. It‚Äôs a well-balanced red fruit brew so far. I‚Äôm excited to come back to it. And they have gnarly Edwin Norena purple honey stocked now as COTM 24. I‚Äôm hoping it lasts for the Nov subscribers!

In addition to phenomenal beans, they‚Äôre also incredibly delightful individuals. Somewhere around COTM 16-18, my bag busted open during shipping. I told them, and they had a replacement to me  two days later. 

They also recently reached out after noticing me touring them on our sub. As thanks for my support, they gave me a gift, hence the amazing mug in the first photo.

Anyway, these are the reasons why I‚Äôm screaming Superlost every time someone asks about subscriptions.",0,1760673234.0,pourover,0,0.5,False

* ‚Ä¢ Obsessed with morbid facts, philosophy, true crime, mysteries, Type O Negative, and dark history.
* ‚Ä¢ While I rely more on logic, I hold personal values I stand by. I can come across as intense.
* ‚Ä¢ In groups, I usually take on a leadership role. I crave structure and competence, and I get frustrated when those goals aren‚Äôt met. I‚Äôm very direct and judgmental, even when I see people trying their best. Still, I want my select group of people to improve. I have internal ideas about how I see people and how they could be, and I judge based on those.
* ‚Ä¢ I judge people quickly, categorize them, which is why I love typology. I tend to trust people only after they prove themselves, but I present a facade to get a real sense of their personalities. I know that sounds manipulative or pretentious, but I‚Äôve done it since childhood.
* ‚Ä¢ I set intense goals that might seem unrealistic to many.
* ‚Ä¢ I choose challenging fields to study or master (STEM, biomedical engineering, AI, neuroscience/neuroengineering, computer science, data analytics, etc.) because they align with mastery and making an impact.
* ‚Ä¢ My life plan is to build momentum toward freedom, knowledge, and impact (not just money).
* ‚Ä¢ If an authority figure or system shares my values and proves to be competent, I follow it for order and structure. But if I see incompetence, corruption, or irrationality, I will choose my autonomy over authority. I see myself as a cynical conformist‚Äîoutwardly following societal expectations to get ahead, while secretly distrustful of human motives and behaviors.
* ‚Ä¢ I crave external validation for my academic achievements, even if I don't like to admit it.
* ‚Ä¢ I'm a Slytherclaw.
* ‚Ä¢ I truly care about my boundaries, future, and safety, but I can be brutally honest and challenging during arguments. 
* When I‚Äôm in public, I‚Äôm very direct, critical, and fast to think and move, so much so that I might bump into someone or something. I like to get in and out of public places. The library is my favorite place to socialize. Now, when it comes to being around the people I‚Äôm close to, I ***LOVE*** to strike up intellectual or creative conversations, talking about plans, I have very witty and dark humor, and interests. I also talk to myself (because I‚Äôm my best company). I laugh at things that might seem ‚Äútoo much‚Äù. 
* I am actually not a stoic,  laugh and enjoy some parts of life, but I am not likely to try to fit in or go off track on my main goals. I don't like parties, I don't maintain friends well (I ghost / go ia for months), and I can be mean and distant to my family. 
* I have been attending online school for the last five years, I am an asynchronous worker, I understand topics quickly, and I'm ALWAYS working to improve my study methods or my routine. ",1,1760673084.0,MbtiTypeMe,2,1.0,False

Every time you flip a switch, charge your phone, or brew a cup of coffee, electricity is working silently in the background. It powers comfort, convenience, and connection ‚Äî but few of us really understand how it flows through our homes. That‚Äôs why having a reliable¬†[**Nassau County electrician**](https://allwayselectriccorp.com/)¬†isn‚Äôt just helpful ‚Äî it‚Äôs essential for safety, efficiency, and peace of mind.

If you‚Äôve ever wondered how electricity travels from the grid to your light fixtures, or why circuit breakers trip, this guide will walk you through the basics of how it all works ‚Äî and why professional electrical expertise matters.

**How Electricity Travels Through Your Home**

Electricity begins its journey at a power plant, where it‚Äôs generated and transmitted through high-voltage lines. Once it reaches your neighborhood, a transformer reduces the voltage to a safer level for residential use.

From there, electricity flows into your home‚Äôs service panel (breaker box) ‚Äî the command center of your electrical system. It distributes power to various circuits throughout your house, ensuring every outlet, switch, and appliance gets the energy it needs.

Each circuit is protected by a breaker, which automatically shuts off when it detects too much current ‚Äî preventing overheating and potential fires.

A¬†[**Nassau County electrician**](https://allwayselectriccorp.com/elevating-electrical-solutions-always-electric-corp-s-electrical-services-for-nassau-county/)¬†can inspect your service panel to ensure it‚Äôs in good condition and capable of handling your household‚Äôs growing energy demands.

**Common Electrical Components You Should Know**

1. **Circuit Breaker Panel:**¬†Protects your home from electrical overloads.
2. **Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs):**¬†Found in kitchens and bathrooms; they prevent electric shocks near water sources.
3. **Outlets and Switches:**¬†Control the flow of power to your devices and lighting.
4. **Wiring:**¬†The hidden network that connects your entire electrical system.

Understanding these basic elements helps you spot early signs of trouble ‚Äî flickering lights, buzzing outlets, or frequently tripped breakers ‚Äî and call a licensed electrician before small issues become costly repairs.

**A Real-Life Story: When Power Met Peace of Mind**

When Michael and Sara moved into their Nassau County home, they loved the vintage charm ‚Äî but not the outdated wiring. Their lights flickered whenever the microwave ran, and their breaker panel was decades old.

After reaching out to¬†[**All Ways Electric Corp.**](https://allwayselectriccorp.com/residential/), the team quickly diagnosed the issue and upgraded the entire system. The result? No more flickering, no more worry ‚Äî just reliable, modern electricity that made their home feel safe and sound again.

‚ÄúIt was like getting a new heart for our house,‚Äù Sara said. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt realize how much peace of mind came from knowing our wiring was up to code.‚Äù

**Why Hiring a Professional Electrician Matters**

* **Safety First:**¬†Handling wiring without expertise can be dangerous.
* **Code Compliance:**¬†Electricians ensure your home meets Nassau County‚Äôs strict electrical standards.
* **Energy Efficiency:**¬†Proper installation and upgrades can lower energy bills.
* **Future-Proofing:**¬†Professionals plan ahead for new appliances, smart home devices, or EV chargers.

**Brighten Up Your Understanding**

Electricity may be invisible, but its impact on your daily life is undeniable. From lighting your favorite spaces to powering your essential devices, it deserves the care and attention of professionals who truly understand it.

If you‚Äôre curious about your home‚Äôs electrical health or considering an upgrade, reach out to your trusted experts ‚Äî because when it comes to safety and comfort, there‚Äôs no substitute for professional insight.

Married for 14 years, together for 17. I love my wife more everyday; she's my best friend, the funniest and smartest person I know, and the only person I trust. But, we are struggling paycheck to paycheck (hcol, debt, aging parent, no e funds, income too high for benefits).

My wife is disabled and we can't seem to get the disability application processed, completed or approved for years. We've had a series of events that has made it so we've either been without transportation or not enough cash for copays, or both, so my wife has been in need of diagnostics so we can next find a treatment plan. It's been 5 years like this. 

We finally had our chance to see her good doctor today to catch her up and get the much needed referrals. We've been mentally prepping for it for a week. First thing in the morning (after coffee), I mentioned that I had asked a friend for gas money so we could get to the appointment, but hadn't gotten a response. That was characterized as sabotage. I ruined the day and all the medical trauma resurfaced. She cancelled the appointment. I didn't secure the cash, so I am accountable for her welfare neglect, again. Even after discussing it dozens of times before, her health was not prioritized, again. 

She hates me. I hate this position we've been in and know my responsibilities. I work full time, I do most of the housework, I make the calls, I sign the forms, I do the pickups, I try to plan so many appointments just to have it end up like this at least half the time. I've disappointed her possibly for the last time. 

I can't make to one up to her so easily. I'm broke from the 10th on until the next month, every month. This was already a rescheduled appointment right after payday that didn't work out because of my kid's school event. So even if I could reschedule, again, she sees me differently now.

Is this financial neglect something deeper? Am I ruining my relationship because I am blaming problems on being poor? Or by simply being poor? How do can I promise to do better if I don't have a plan for things to change? I'm not looking for absolution. We've made it this far by always communicating, but now I can't seem to breakthrough with a true honest apology, taking responsibility and a promise or demonstration of change... Partly because I am refusing complete blame I think. 

But also partly because I can't do this for much longer either without something changing... So are we doomed? ",1,1760671847.0,Marriage,3,1.0,False

I ordered never ending soup salad and breadsticks as did he. The soup we like was sold out so they brought us another soup it was gross and mushy (something like chicken and dumplings) it had bits of hard carrots in it. My partner is a very picky eater so he obviously did not like it either. The waitress brought us another soup that taste like cheap vegetable soup my partner took maybe two bites I probably ate half the bowl but I was far from impressed it tasted like something I could've made it home with canned ingredients. We ended up just eating breadsticks I was really defeated so we ordered a dessert to share my partner was raving about the tiramisu. I hate coffee and it tasted like soggy cake that had been sitting it black coffee. By that point, we just paid the check 65$ and left. When we finally got to the car I cried not uncontrollably but I was really sad and defeated because not only was I still hungry I spent 65$ basically on breadsticks and a Coke but also because we never get to go out together and eat I was really looking forward to eating something because we don't have a lot of money... most of the food we eat it cheap and not impressive just whatever is on sale. I know it'll be a long time before we get to go out again. He looked at me and said are you really crying over food? .... it hurt my feelings because I was crying over so much more than that I felt like absolutely nothing went right I was still hungry. Even dessert was bad. Since we spent money on this we won't have money for other things now I know I sound stupid especially now that I'm writing this out I just wish he could've tried to understand it instead of making me feel bad about it",10,1760671846.0,pregnant,12,0.86,False

Here‚Äôs the simple urban composting method I‚Äôve been teaching. would love your thoughts, if they are kind ; )","I‚Äôve been running small compost projects in the Bay Area, helping neighbors turn waste into soil, etc. This is my go-to urban method that actually gets that good stuff going.  
I‚Äôd love to help un-gatekeep compost ‚Äî DM me if you want the full Notion doc (free, of course).

  
Composting‚Äôs been way more kind and forgiving than gardening (to me!) and great for my mental health. Please be kind here too.

Urban composters usually face three hurdles:

* Hard to find/gather bulk carbon without a farm or yard
* Rodents if you add kitchen scraps to open pile
* Little space

This approach helps ‚Äî and the real game-changer for me has been **rescue-bunny bedding**.  
Most mid- to large-size cities have bunny rescues (because, well, bunnies do what they do). Their used bedding is a waste byproduct and perfect free **bulk carbon** with bonus manure (garden gold). Absorbent, abundant, and better in soil than landfill.

Add free **bulk coffee grounds** from a local caf√© for nitrogen ‚Äî the similar particle size of bedding and grounds means they break down fast together.

# üê∞ The Method (Simple 1‚Äì2‚Äì3)

**1. Tumble first:** Pre-break down food scraps in a tumbler or sealed bin. Add a scoop of bunny bedding to control odor and speed things up.  
**2. Build your pile:** Roughly **1 bag bedding : ¬Ω bag coffee grounds.** Stir, moisten, and cover with cardboard or burlap. Any bin or corner works.  
**3. Feed ongoing:** Once tumbler scraps aren‚Äôt recognizable, bury them in the middle. Stir when you can. Keep it damp, not soggy.

\*note that I also used the bedding + coffee in just tumbler too and it works great, heats up, no problem, if you don't want a big pile. 

# Compost is forgiving

It‚Äôs art and science ‚Äî mostly observation.  
Dry ‚Üí add water  
Dense ‚Üí add air  
Cold ‚Üí add nitrogen (coffee grounds)  
Wet ‚Üí add carbon (bunny bedding) 

Perfection isn‚Äôt the goal ‚Äî decay always wins. You‚Äôre just helping it along.

Would love to hear how others compost in cities or small spaces. Happy to answer questions or hear what free urban found ingredients worked for you.

And instead of me thinking about all the ways I don't I thought instead. ""Yes I do."" It got me up and I tilted my head. ""Yes I do have CPTSD."" I said out loud.

I had a very abusive cold father who honestly has no intuition or even sensitivity to the world around him. I believe he has a form of ASD. Then I have a mother who is most definitely a narcissist with BPD. I have older siblings who don't have sensitivity or intuition and are also very implosive. I had to grow up around them and rely on them for everything. You know what? You want to know what makes that more soul crushing to a child then anything else then what I just told you? Let me whisper in your ear...

""It's soul crushing to a child to have no one to rely on.""

""I don't have time to teach you."" Was my mother's go to quip when I was just starting to want to learn. Or the moments she'd purposefully make it seem okay to tease me and get my siblings in on it. One moment people were happy to answer your questions. But then others they were just as happy to make you suffer. Flip, flop, flip, flop, flip, flop. Trust or not to trust?

I got to see everyone else get to date and go to prom. I'm the only one who never did that. It's something I've caught my mom giggling about. Tell I speak up and remind her it makes her worst then her mother. That gets her to chock on a frog. But then that brings up another problem with me.

""How can I both stand up for myself and just completely break down at other times?""

I have a form of DiD. Growing up I never told anyone this. But I heard a voice at times. It wasn't a scary voice and it wasn't an angry voice. Well it didn't like it when I was mistreated. It once said to me. ""Your mother is stupid fucking fat bitch."" Me at four years old got scared over that thought. ""How do you get an imaginary friend to eat soap? Am I gonna eat soap?!"" Only for it to say to me. ""I don't intend to upset you. I don't like how your mother treats you."" 

Now it says everything that a child's imaginary friend was more adult then the parents. Now comes the next part.

""I have ADHD of some sort!""

Okay this one is harder to pin down. It kind of comes back to DiD. It's one or the other. Cause I have a hard time learning. It comes from having to learn with shitty people for teachers. As a child I wanted to learn and to grow. But man it's hard to focus when your teacher is abusive both mentally, emotionally, and physically. It's hard to feel a sense of academic accomplishment when you have to share it with people like this. It's hard to say if I'm ADHD without being officially tested. But it's better to assume I do in some way.

""My entire family is my CPTSD triggers.""

I love them, I hate them, I love them and I share so much of my life with them. But they'd rather let me beg for what I needed as a child then to give it to me or allow me to have it. They knew what they were doing to me and it breaks my heart. A mother who'll always have a power trip over how she's treated me in my life. I get lost in thinking about them and their emotions and their heath. I am like a dog to them. Their always after an emotional high and I'm that supply.

""So what does this all mean for me?""

While I don't recommend coming to these conclusion without a professional. But for me and the life I've lived up to now it all seems obvious. I have ADHD, HSP, mild ASD (It's official in a sibling), Some mild form of BPD and or DiD and CPTSD. I said I wasn't gay. But I still ended up an alphabet person. It means I am an enigma to behold to the normal people in my life. It means I really need to take my needs very seriously and to be patient with myself.

What are those needs? Well it's funny but ADHD people who don't want to take medications are the best guide lines. It is mostly just spending some time outside, doing a form of exercise for 15 minutes a day, having a set bed time, avoiding the things you think make it worst. I make it a habit to do all that right when I wake up.

Well it turns out coffee and the internet as I use it don't help. Not at all and not in this time and space we're in. So for the past month I've forgone both those things. And it's been a wild ride for sure. Also my browser and phone are set up with so many parental blockers and timers and routine apps. Without the internet it's been a lot of books or art projects. Well... Not all the time since my coffee withdrawals are really bad. But at the same time I'm finding my life is worth living without those things. I feel so much more calm without them. There is no rush going on inside of myself at least.

As for my CPTSD. Well I start by avoiding my triggers. I know I'm the one who loves them all unconditionally. But it still family isn't about how much damage an individual(s) can take. But family is where individuals start. For me I can decide on who and what I share and I know all their little dirty tricks and I know all their methods for making someone feel down. For a while I'm gonna seem really quiet to the people around me. It's better then constantly telling them about my CPTSD. But that will pass the more I'm away from my triggers.

But regardless of all this progress. It's society that I'm stuck having to watch make the same mistakes over and over again. I believe that homeschooling is an existential threat to our society and way of life and to progress it's self. Isolation causes children to work harder when their older for all they've missed and I've witnessed this personally. Through myself and others. I am not someone who thinks I have all the answers. But we as a world have to start holding each other to some kind of standard and to find some way to not make everything a contest of who's loudest.

Until that time I'll be over here taking care of myself. I'll be keeping my heart big and keeping at being a sensitive person and always having a huge imagination. I love those qualities, I love those qualities of myself. Until I'm done and past this Hot Bean Water Withdrawals. It's the after that I look forward to the most and putting distance between me and my triggers.

Recovery is possible. It starts with you and the hard truths.

There have been countless moments where I knew you were the one I wanted to spend my life with, like when you turn the car around because we spotted a bird, sorry about that one time they were plastic. Or when we went camping for the first time and I actually had fun. Or when you moved in with me without hesitation. But maybe I knew it deep down from our first chess match in your basement because we haven‚Äôt spent a day apart since.

You've encouraged me to grow in ways that I didn't think were possible for someone like me, and when I am at my lowest, you don't let me drown.

I would rather share one lifetime with you, than face all the ages of this world alone because You are the happiness and love I‚Äôve wished for on every birthday candle, shooting star, eyelash, and dandelion.

In this lifetime, I can‚Äôt promise I won‚Äôt leave my almost empty coffee cups in the sink, and I‚Äôll most certainly keep buying clothes and shoes.

But I can promise that I‚Äôll always grab a bag of BBQ Ruffles for you whenever I see them.

I vow to be there for you at the end of a long day to give you a hug and be your peace.

To go to concerts with you and do my best heavy metal face.

I vow to support, encourage, and believe in all your dreams.

To never take for granted the ways you love me, and to always show you mine.

I vow to grow with you through every chapter of our lives and face all challenges together.

And when life feels ashen, I‚Äôll be your bonfire.

And I vow that when we‚Äôre frogs in our next life, I‚Äôll sit on your lily pad with you and our sing our froggy song, and to find you in all lives after.

Hi all ‚Äî looking for quick lighting + furniture advice for a living room mid-renovation.

**Current setup**

‚Ä¢ 	Replacing existing recessed downlights with gimbal trims aimed at each corner for corner washes of living room. The corners are currently pictured with downlights which will NOT be the case.

‚Ä¢ 	Added two new recessed spots in the center of the room, one on EITHER side of the coffee table, because the corners alone will leave the middle dark. This will not be centered over coffee table.

**Goal**

‚Ä¢ 	Even, comfortable ambient light that complements corner accenting.

‚Ä¢ 	Clean, modern aesthetic. Nothing overpowering as my ceiling height is low at 8ft

**Options I‚Äôm considering**

1. Low-profile LED flush/flat downlights/up lights with a wide, soft beam for unobtrusive ambient fill.
2. Two small semi‚Äëflush fixtures on either side of the coffee table
3. Recessed adjustable downlights with a wide beam to keep everything visually consistent.
4. Scrap it all, re-run electrical to have a single centered lighting over coffee (keeping corner washes). This would be most expensive :(

Looking forward to the advice!

*The Tionese were packing their kriffing missiles with sand. Sure, they included kinetic projectiles, but packed around those projectiles in the bomb casing was this sand like material they used as chaff, it would spray out around ten minutes before impact and disrupt the Point defenses of the Hutt Fleet. The problem was, ten minutes before impact allowed it to spread a massive distance, so every, kriffing, munition, that kriffing, flew towards the kriffing fleet would have a cloud of it, that would every KRIFFING SHIP!

""Wrong"" *The woman states.* ""Tion accepts the surrender of those who surrender before combat. And you here who surrender, are more useful alive than dead. Culpable as you may be for what has happened, you are also useful propaganda assets, living, propaganda assets, to tell the world the first hand accounts of being a slave to the Hutt fleet, of how horrible your masters were, how evil they treated you, how you wish your people could be liberated."" *She pauses, her head tilting slightly, despite no visible face he could feel her eyes burning into him.* ""So are you going to die alongside the Captain currently having a stroke in his cabin, or are you going to head the bridge, and when the time comes to jump into Hyperspace with the rest of the fleet.

My boyfriend (31M) wants me (27F) to workout and drink less. I want him to help with basic chores and stop picking a fight when I‚Äôm on my period. We‚Äôve lived together for over a year and have been dating for about 2. How can we turn the situation into a positive outcome instead of continuing to build resentment for each other?

I work full time in retail which means being on my feet for 8 hours, pleasing customers, and moving around the heavy product with daily shipment and merchandising. Due to this and various bs, I will relax on the couch pretty much everyday after work and have a drink or two a few times a week. He works in an office setting and will often ask me to go on a walk with him at the end of the day. For a while, I was reluctant because of how exhausted I was from my day but I started to more as my routine and habits began to frustrate him.

The problem is, he brings this up and it always turns into a fight because I would like him to make some changes too. I want him to do any amount of cleaning up after himself around our apartment, as well as, understand how my menstrual cycle affects my energy and mood. We share a bathroom, kitchen, bed, and I do everything. Dishes will sit in the sink for days, he recently learned we have a vacuum, his new thing is leaving pistachio shells on the coffee table. I dont bring up how annoying it is, I just accept it for what it is. About once a month, ironically when I am on my period and after I warn him of my state, the conversation about my ‚Äòlack of change‚Äô is brought up. 

He continues to claim I haven‚Äôt made any effort to change even though I dont drink during the week and will go on walks with him when I just want to sit down. Regardless of my efforts, there is no effort on his end with what I ask. It doesn‚Äôt seem like he understands my perspective and why it‚Äôs frustrating for me as well.

TLDR; My boyfriend (31M) wants me (27F) to workout after my full time, physically demanding job and generally drink less. I want him to help with basic chores and stop picking a fight when I‚Äôm on my period. We both feel like the other person is not doing anything to help change how we feel.

HELP; How can we turn the situation into a positive outcome instead of continuing to build resentment for each other?

Hi all looking for quick lighting + furniture advice for a living room mid-renovation.

**Current setup**

‚Ä¢ 	Replacing existing recessed downlights with gimbal trims aimed at each corner for corner washes of living room. The corners are currently pictured with downlights which will NOT be the case.

‚Ä¢ 	Added two new recessed spots in the center of the room, one on either side of the coffee table, because the corners alone will leave the middle dark. This will not be centered over coffee table.

**Goal**

‚Ä¢ 	Even, comfortable ambient light that complements corner accenting.

‚Ä¢ 	Clean, modern aesthetic. Nothing overpowering as my ceiling height is low at 8ft

**Options I‚Äôm considering**

1. Low-profile LED flush/flat downlights/up lights with a wide, soft beam for unobtrusive ambient fill.
2. Two small pendants or semi‚Äëflush fixtures on either side of the coffee table ( current option)
3. Recessed adjustable downlights with a wide beam to keep everything visually consistent.
4. Scrap it all, re-run electrical to have a single centered lighting over coffee (keeping corner washes). This would be most expensive :(

Looking forward to the advice!",1,1760670684.0,Lighting,0,1.0,False

Lefty here.

I'm gonna be real honest with you all. 

I have been completely misunderstanding the concept of design locations on mugs.

I never really understood why everyone thought mugs were hand-specific.

But after a few posts on here, it's clicking.

You're supposed to be able to SEE the design on the mug AS YOU DRINK. 

See, now. I always assumed the design was for other people to see as you drank. Like, you're showing your cool mug to everyone around you. That's why I never saw mugs as left or right-handed. It made sense to me for the design to be on the outside. 

And I feel like, correct me if I'm wrong, that's how some mugs are made to be seen too? Right? I mean, don't you want to show off the crappy graphic of your grandchildren to anyone who's watching you drink your morning coffee? Don't you want everyone to be aware of whom the #1 Boss is? 

Do I just not understand mugs? Or have I just been led to believe mug designs are supposed to be on the outside because they always have been for me? 

Then again, I often switch the hand I'm holding the mug in depending on the location the mug ends up. So, I might not be understanding the intricacies due to my flippant and irresponsible hand usage! 

So.

***Memory transcription subject:*** **Cadet Sarah Rosario, Starfleet Academy**

*Date \[standardized human time\]:July 30, 2138*

‚ÄúTo make things more concise, start at the beginning of the story cadet.‚Äù Said Commander Tuvok. ‚ÄúYou mentioned this was a party of some fashion. Please tell me who was in attendance.‚Äù

I took a deep breath, I was pretty shaken after what had happened at Mika's house and I have been questioned by at least five different agencies so far since we were transported back to Starfleet HQ. It would seem that for me at least it was the turn of Starfleet Intelligence to take a crack at my story to piece things together. Seemingly noticing my tiredness the Vulcan commander had brought a coffee to me which was greatly appreciated, it was more than likely he had done so to make me more open to talk to him which was unnecessary. I was not going to risk my place at the academy over hiding some trivial or embarrassing detail.

‚ÄúYes of course Commander. There was of course Lieutenant Reissig there as it was his house and his party that was being hosted. I went there with Dr.Vensa and doctors Wilen and Fraysa.‚Äù I replied ‚ÄúThere was also Lieutenant Reissig‚Äôs partner councilor Zoren and three of his colleagues from the consulate as well.‚Äù

Commander Tuvok typed into his PADD as I spoke but kept that Vulcan expression of unwavering passivity that let no inner thoughts through.

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù He replied. ‚ÄúTo your knowledge did anybody outside of those invited know of the gathering.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo commander.‚Äù I replied after I took a sip of my coffee. ‚ÄúI did not tell anybody about it other than coordinating with the others who were invited on what to bring.‚Äù

His eyebrow lifted ever so slightly before he wrote something else down on his PADD.

‚ÄúIn the region of the continent that you were in, the weather is rather enjoyable for many this time of the year.‚Äù He continued. ‚ÄúDid this celebration happen inside the dwelling or did it spread outside?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe entire gathering was outdoors Commander.‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúThere is a stream behind the house and down a small hillside where we spent the entire day. The only times people went inside were to change or to get more refreshments to my knowledge. The entire idea of the party was to enjoy the summer weather and spend some time with friends in the water.‚Äù

To call the party nice was the understatement of the year, I had been to the stream before once for another meetup and it was amazing. Over the generations Mika‚Äôs family had turned their property into a slice of eden. For instance there was a smaller waterfall in the stream that had been converted so that the water would flow from the top into raised pools that could fit a few people each. The pools were all connected so that the water would flow from the top one all the way to the bottom one eventually into the lower level of the stream.

When Vensa and I had arrived it was made apparent that we were the last ones there but just barely as Wilen and Fraysa had just made it down the stone pathway though the patch of trees that provided shade over the path and were talking to Mika. We made our way down the path and I still remember the sweet and honeylike fragrance of the beebalm and butterfly bush that were in full bloom near the waters edge. After saying hello to the people that were on dry land we placed our bags and cooler on a towel that had been placed under a weeping willow that was by the waters edge.

Once we changed inside we came back down in our swimwear and joined the others in relaxing in the relaxing water while music played from a portable speaker and we all just got to talk about life. It felt nice to do something other than classes or studying even if I got to spend my weekends with Vensa. The Rexelians were great company for the party as they were telling stories of Rontar which made me want to visit, apparently there were not really any large landmasses by most species standards. Instead the population lived on the various islands that formed massive chains along mostly the equatorial region of the planet causing many settlements to have amazing weather year round. The soft drinks they brought were tasty as well, the one I tried tasted like a lemonade with basil and rosemary added yet it was blue.

‚ÄúWhen did things as humans say, turn for the worse cadet?‚Äù Asked Tuvok. ‚ÄúWhen did you first see Mr.Williams?‚Äù

I shuddered slightly before responding, the memories were still fresh in my mind and I was in no hurry to dredge them even closer to the surface. Dispute that I knew this was just something that needed to be done.

‚ÄúIt was later in the day and the sun was starting to set. They had brought out a little fire pit and wanted to roast some marshmallows and make smores.‚Äù I said as I recalled what happened. ‚ÄúI offered to head up to the house and get the ingredients since they were just placed on the kitchen countertop. Despite it starting to get dark I could still see pretty well since there were garden lights along the path as well on the house. I was about 10 meters from the back door to the house when it opened and I saw Noah walk out. We both just stared at one another for what felt like ages in shock before anything happened.‚Äù

I took another deep breath before my mind wandered as I recalled what had happened next so I could inform Commander Tuvok.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing here Noah!‚Äù I yelled at him, not caring who heard. ‚ÄúFirst you vandalise his house and now you break in? What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you want to get sent to a penal colony?‚Äù

I was about to keep yelling but that was when I spotted it in his hand, while the design was not a Starfleet standard nor one I had seen before I knew a weapon when there was one. I stood stone still as Noah had practically started to shake with rage, there was also a look of desperation in his eyes.

‚ÄúSarah, look I am sorry. I did not want things to end this way but words are just not working anymore.‚Äù He said with an almost dejected look on his face. ‚ÄúIf they would have just listened to us then things could have gone differently.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù I asked, trying to figure out what was going on and to stall whatever he was doing. ‚ÄúYou are not making any sense.‚Äù

Noah then started to pace back and forth for a moment before turning to face me once again.

‚ÄúThe Federation! It‚Äôs bad enough that they allowed aliens on Earth from their old universe and dilute their culture, they got along okay I guess and we could deal with them in time.‚Äù He said as he got angrier and angier. As he spoke I could smell the scent of something burning despite the firepit not being lit yet. ‚ÄúBut then they go on and try to get the aliens from *this* universe to join, you know the ones that want us extinct!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut noooo, nobody will take us seriously so we have to take things into our own hands.‚Äù He said as he became more and more manic. I was trying to figure a way to either get to cover quickly or to disarm him when he got closer to me. ‚ÄúSo we made a deal, in exchange for some material support we just have to make sure that the aliens know that Earth is not a safe place for them and no more Federation! We were planning that already so that's not too bad of a deal. Once they are gone then it can be just the two of us, just like before we were taken from the *Odyssey*.‚Äù

Tuvok's words then pulled me out of my retelling of the tale when he asked what had happened after that.

‚ÄúThere was some sort of explosion from the house. I had instinctively covered my face and eyes from the bright light and sound but when I opened them all the windows had been shattered and there was a fire raging from inside.‚Äù I said as I tried to keep an even tone. ‚ÄúNoah took that opportunity to run off towards the woods towards the side of the house. I am pretty sure my yelling at Noah had gotten the attention of the people at the bottom of the hill before the explosion because a few of them were at the top of the hill rather quickly.‚Äù

Tuvok continued to type into his PADD without so much as a change of expression save for the occasional raise to the eyebrow.

‚ÄúCan you elaborate on how Lieutenant Reissig sustained his injuries as well as Mr.Williams?‚Äù Asked Tuvok

I cleared my throat before speaking as I straightened myself for what felt like the tenth time this conversation.

‚ÄúYes, I can Commander. Like I said some people were pretty close to me when the explosion happened, when Noah ran Lieutenant Reissig ran after him and easily caught up to him. He tackled him to the ground despite being smaller than Noah and he just started screaming and trying to hit him.‚Äù I said as I recalled what brutality had happened afterwards. ‚ÄúAt one point Noah tried to use his weapon on Lieutenant Reissig and they both struggled for it and it went off. The next thing I know Mika falls over to the side with this nasty looking burn on his chest and is not moving while Noah gets up and tries to run off after he saw what happened.‚Äù

I shuttered before continuing.

‚ÄúI then heard this‚Ä¶ the best way I could describe it was a *roar* from Zoren. He charged forward and grabbed Noah *slamming* him into the ground and just started beating him. Wilen and Fraysa together were *barely* able to pull him off Noah and if they had not been able to I think he would have killed Noah. Even with how dark it was starting to get I saw that Noah was bleeding *alot*.‚Äù I continued. ‚ÄúWhile that was happening Vensa had used her comm badge to contact emergency services and bring in planetary security and get an emergency transport for Mika and Noah to the hospital.‚Äù

Tuvok after typing into his PADD for a few more moments had actually done something different and turned it off before looking up to face me.

‚ÄúThat is all that is needed for you at this time Cadet. You may be brought back in the future for further questioning of this incident. There have been a string of similar incidents across Revival Alliance space over the past 8 hours so resources are limited as of now.‚Äù He said as he got up and motioned for me to follow him out of his office. ‚ÄúYou are free to go. Are there any questions you have at this time?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust one really, is Mika alright?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI had never seen a phaser burn quite like that before, they look much different in pictures and wanted to give him my well wishes after what happened to both him and his home.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe latest I was informed was that the Lieutenant was unconscious but in stable condition. I can inform the Starfleet Central Medical Complex of your wish to extend your well wishes when he wakes.‚Äù Tuvok replied as he opened the door to the office. ‚ÄúAs for the weapon he was attacked with, it was not a phaser that grazed his body.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat was it then?‚Äù I asked, confused.¬†

‚Äú*A disruptor.‚Äù*



***Memory transcription subject:*** **Lieutenant Mika Reissig, Starfleet Science Officer**

*Date \[standardized human time\]:July 31, 2138*

As I slowly came to I began to piece together the events of the day leading up to right before I fell unconscious. The last thing I remembered before waking up was when I tackled Noah to the ground and was trying to kill him for destroying the last thing that connected me to my parents and sister, our home. When I saw the flames spilling out of the windows and I saw that fucker running away like the coward he is I was filled with rage and saw red, before I knew it I was on the ground and hitting him, thats the last thing I remembered.

As my eyes opened I could feel a dull pain on the left side of my chest just below the collarbone. My entire body felt sore and somewhat weak but that spot is what stood out above everything else, as my eyes started to adjust to the light in the room I could tell that I was in some sort of hospital. Most likely Starfleet Medical if I was to hazard a guess since it was Starfleet doctors who were passing by in the hallway.

As I stirred I heard footsteps rapidly approaching my bed and I turned to see Zoren, the t-shirt and shorts he was wearing from the party were now stained as if he had fallen in the dirt. As he came closer I saw a look of pain and worry that was clear as day across his face, he looked terrible as if he had not gotten sleep in days. I was still unsure of *how* exactly we got to this situation

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake.‚Äù He said with a shaky voice as he pulled me in a rather tight embrace. ‚ÄúBabe, you scared me so much, I thought for a moment we lost you.‚Äù

It took a few moments for Zoren to release me and when he did he looked to be on the verge of tears and that look on his face nearly broke my heart to see him in such a state.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I asked as Zoren had moved to just holding my hand as I laid in my hospital bed. ‚ÄúThe last thing I remember is wrestling Noah to the ground and trying to wring his neck.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe pulled out a disruptor and the both of you wrestled for it and it went off, grazing your chest and giving you a pretty nasty burn.‚Äù Zoren said with a shaky voice. ‚ÄúThe shock I guess knocked you out and it was barely a minute later that you were transported here for treatment. While you were in treatment I was questioned by Starfleet and by my government, same with pretty much everyone else as far as I can tell. Nobody else was hurt either so I guess that is the best news from this whole situation.‚Äù

When Zoren had mentioned the burn I had put two and two together and pulled back a small portion of the hospital gown that I was in to see the injury on my chest but it was covered by a rather large adhesive bandage of sorts. *I must be on painkillers if I am not screaming in agony from a disruptor burn that was able to knock me out. This is going to take forever to recover from since dermal regeneration doesn't work on those types of burns.* I noticed that Zoren was looking at me rather intensely as he was holding my hand and massaging it. He looked like he wanted to say something but did not know how to exactly.

‚ÄúHow long have I been out?‚Äù I asked him, breaking the silence.

‚ÄúIt's three in the morning. Everyone else involved has gone home for a while save for Vensa, she stayed with me for moral support for a while until she went home about an hour ago.‚Äù Zoren said. ‚ÄúShe gave me some reading suggestions as well which was nice. We chatted as well and that kept me from going insane worrying about you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶‚Äù I replied as I tried to think of a way to ask what had been filling me with some amount of dread. ‚ÄúAnd my house? How bad was it?‚Äù

Zoren let out a deep sigh before responding.

‚ÄúWhatever caused the fire and explosion was apparently very potent, from what little I have been told there is not really much of a house left.‚Äù Zoren said as he kept massaging my hand. ‚ÄúThe fire suppression system had been disabled and by the time the first responders got there pretty much the entire place was up in flames. Both law enforcement and Starfleet are still investigating what was the cause and how the security and fire systems were disabled. I am so sorry that this happened.‚Äù

As Zoren talked I had expected to be overwhelmed with emotion, that I would be screaming or crying over the destruction of the home that had been in my family for generations, the home that was the last connection to my dead family. I thought that I would be sad, angry, distraught, feeling *something* about the situation but that was not the case. All I felt emotionally about what happened to my house was *numb*.

As Zoren had been massaging my hand I looked down and noticed his and saw some sort of discoloration on the knuckles and parts of the fingers where the skin was now a few shades darker than normal. It was not too noticeable before due to his skin being a darker shade of red already but when I looked it was definitely different from the surrounding tissue. *Is that bruising? How did he get that?*

‚ÄúHow are you feeling?‚Äù Zoren asked after what felt like a long stretch of silence while I was lost in thought. ‚ÄúAre you in any pain?‚Äù

‚ÄúA bit of a dull pain where the bandage is, but considering what happened I guess I can‚Äôt complain.‚Äù I grunted as I shifted slightly in the biobed to get at least somewhat comfortable. ‚ÄúI mostly just feel really out of it I guess. Probably from whatever painkillers or other medications they have me on.‚Äù

At some point while we were talking Zoren had pulled up a chair next to my biobed and had sat in it. After I had finished talking he moved from massaging my hand to holding it with both of his. We both sat there in silence as he stared at my hand before he looked up at me where he just looked *terrified*.

‚ÄúI thought I had lost you. You were just laying there in the grass, all the color gone from your skin and you were not moving.‚Äù He said in a voice hardly above a whisper, any trace of the joy or passion his voice almost always carried was completely gone. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you do it Mika? Why did you chase after him when he was running away and you knew he could have a weapon?‚Äù

My breath hitched at both the question and the sincerity of which he asked it. To be honest I had been trying to think of *why* exactly I had chased after Noah as well. It took me a few moments but I was able to come up with my best guess for a reason.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I am not really sure to be honest, everything is kind of a haze from tonight. I just remember feeling *so angry* at him, an anger that I have not felt towards an individual before.‚Äù I replied in a shaky voice. ‚ÄúI guess‚Ä¶ I wanted him to feel the same pain I was feeling right then. To me that house was not just my home, it was a testament to the determination of my family to not only survive but to thrive. I am the only living member left of my family and that house was my last connection to them and he‚Ä¶ just *killed* that last connection. I know it was stupid for me to chase him but that is the best reason I can think of. I am just grateful that the disruptor only grazed me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about next time? What if you are not so lucky next time you decide to act recklessly?‚Äù Zoren said as he locked his eyes with mine, tears beginning to form. ‚ÄúHow is that fair to the people left behind who care about you? Did you stop to think how I would feel seeing the man I love killed right in front of me?‚Äù

My entire body tensed at what he was saying because I knew he was right. I was nearly brought to tears by his last sentence because we both knew that I knew the answer to that perfectly well and it hit very close to home. By breath hitched as the memories of the Yulpa homeworld came back to the surface, memories of seeing *my* form being the one to kill *him*. Zoren seemed to notice my change in state which caused his whole demeanor to change from one of being upset at me to one of worry. His eyes widened in shock as he realised what he just said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Mika, that last part was uncalled for. I am so sorry to bring up something like that when you just woke up in the hospital.‚Äù Zoren said. ‚ÄúHow about I ju-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou love me?‚Äù I asked, cutting him off.

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust now when you were talking you asked how I thought you would feel seeing the man *you love* being killed right in front of you.‚Äù I stated. ‚ÄúSo you love me?‚Äù

Zoren held my hand tighter as he looked right into my eyes.

‚ÄúOf course I do.‚Äù He said softly. ‚ÄúWe can talk about it after you get discharged and are able to get some rest.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, I would like that.‚Äù I responded as I patted his hand. ‚ÄúWhen do you want to meet up?‚Äù

Zoren then gave a small laugh.

‚ÄúI was thinking that after you are discharged you come and stay with me.‚Äù He said almost nervously. ‚ÄúWith what happened to your home it‚Äôs not like you can go back there any time soon and since it's the weekend I should be able to make sure you are okay the next few days for your initial recovery.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure Zoren?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to inconvenience you or anything like that while I deal with all of this. I would not want to cause you any stress by having to host me or anything like that.‚Äù

Zoren then stared at me for a few seconds in what looked like disbelief before he shook his head.

‚ÄúYour house just burnt down and you were shot point blank. I believe if anybody has been inconvenienced it is you.‚Äù Zoren chuckled. ‚ÄúThink about it this way, with you at my loft it will make me feel better knowing that you are close by until this whole situation settles down.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess you are right. I do appreciate what you are doing for me, Zoren.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAfter they discharge me I guess we will head to your place and crash.‚Äù

Shortly after that my doctor had entered the room and asked me a myriad of questions about my pain levels and any symptoms while performing follow up scans of my wound before changing the bandage. Normally I would have looked out of a morbid sense of curiosity but with all I was dealing with I refrained from doing so. After my scans were all within acceptable range I was given the option to either remain for observation for the next day or so or to leave as long as I had the wound checked regularly by a medical professional while I recovered. I opted for the second option, no offense to Vensa but hospitals freaked me out.

As I was signing the PADD with my discharge forms and about to get ready to leave, Zoren had brought over a bag with the few things of mine that were either on me when I was brought in or outside my house that he could grab before coming here. It was my PADD, comm badge and a set of summer clothes save for the shirt which was a new one since the other had been cut off of me. Once I finished the forms I changed out of my hospital gown and went down to the hospital pharmacy to pick up the medications needed to care for the burn as well as the bandages that would need to be changed out.

Once we finished with that we sluggishly made our way to the maglev train and it only took a few stops to get on the street of Zoren‚Äôs residential building. As we walked along the sidewalk I felt so tired and practically had to be guided along by Zoren as we made the trip in near silence. When we made it inside his loft he took the bags we were carrying and placed them on the kitchen island before guiding me up the stairs to his bedroom where I promptly shed my shirt and shorts and climbed into bed exhausted. At this point I was so tired both physically and emotionally I could not care what happened as long as I could sleep.¬†

I heard Zoren laugh some before I could tell he turned off the light and had got into bed with me and pulled me close so that my back was to his front as he spooned me from behind. He had one arm wrapped over my stomach while the other had snaked under the pillow I was using, propping me up slightly. His body heat combined with the slight purring sound he was making has instantly put me at ease causing me to start to be flooded with all the emotions that have been building up since the fire. I lost track of how long I had cried but Zoren held me all the same while telling me that I was going to get through this. After I had calmed myself down he spoke up one last time before I fell asleep in his arms.

‚ÄúAre you comfortable?‚Äù He asked as he lightly rubbed me. ‚ÄúI want you to know that no matter what I will always be here for you my love.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlways?‚Äù I asked

My background started on the technical side (telecom tech) and moved into sales (have a lot of experience working on fibre builds and expansions, selling to stakeholders for MDU builds, etc). So I at least understand how complex projects run ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt know the language or the rhythm of construction sales.

I‚Äôm treating the chat as exploratory, but part of me actually wants the job. I miss feeling like what I do matters locally, that I‚Äôm not just moving numbers around for a massive company and I can have a direct impact on my job. I‚Äôd love to get a bit more hands-on again ‚Äî technical, operational, community-facing.

For those who‚Äôve jumped industries, especially into something like construction or trades:
	‚Ä¢	What helped you make a strong first impression when you had no direct experience?
	‚Ä¢	How did you position your transferable skills without sounding like an outsider?
	‚Ä¢	Anything you‚Äôd avoid saying or asking in that kind of chat?

Appreciate any insight.",2,1760670476.0,sales,4,1.0,False

‚ö†Ô∏è TW/CW: Violence, injury, trauma, secrecy, emotional repression, guilt ‚ö†Ô∏è

üåô Camille Varon is a woman living two lives. To you and her brother, she‚Äôs just a tired artist with ink-stained fingers and a soft smile‚Äîthe one who cooks warm meals and laughs too easily. But behind the paint-streaked apron and the smell of coffee lies someone far more dangerous: Snow Moretti‚Äôs right hand, the quiet shadow that cleans up every mess and never asks for mercy. Once a broke art student stealing to save her brother, Camille now carries a gun with the same hands that used to hold brushes. And every time she lies to you about where she‚Äôs been, it hurts a little more.

üìú The story begins after a long, violent night. The city hums quietly as Camille walks through the door, bruised, exhausted, and pretending she‚Äôs fine. You‚Äôre there‚Äîher reminder that warmth still exists. She forces a smile, hides the blood beneath her sleeve, and says she just ‚Äúhad a rough shift at the museum.‚Äù Then, before you can question her, she changes the subject and starts making dinner. Like always.

‚ÄúShe kills to survive, but lives for the people she loves.‚Äù üåπ

They were all clear to him besides one story, as he could not quite piece together how or what it was about. Counselors told him it was anxiety, and it was not a big deal. However, he knew it was a big deal and that it is a situation that was much more sinister than it would appear.

He called up Pappy, and asked if he could come over for coffee. Pappy was older now and not quite as social, but he told him he could come for a little.

Chucky pulled up in his scooter bike and put the peg down, took a deep breath, and mentally prepared himself for his conversation. He needed answers.

Pappy sat down and brought him a cup of coffee, and then poured himself a big glass of whiskey. Chucky told him he needed him sober in which Pappy told him that this was making him nervous, as he had no clue what Chucky was talking about. He asked if he was on drugs, in which Chucky told him he had smoked a joint to calm himself down earlier. Pappy was concerned that Chucky dropped out of college to fully pursue this dilemma.

Chucky started by taking out a book full of his analysis of the stories Pappy had told him. First was the pirate ghost story, in which Pappy nodded. Next was the Boogieman that slept in the attic story, followed by the werewolf vampire mashup. Finally, Chuck looked him in the eyes and asked him if he recognized the picture he is showing him. It was a drawing of some creature with 3 arms and blood red eyes. Pappy squinted and told him that he enjoyed his drawing skills but did not recognize it. He asked why is it wearing eye shadow. Chucky pointed out that it was blood, in which Pappy told him it looked like his ex wife.

Chucky slammed it down and told him he remembers the creature as Mr Fongro and it was a story about some kind of entity that grew stronger with every cut and bruise endured by the listener. He told Pappy he remembers his knee scrapes growing up hurting extra, and more than normal. Pappy reasoned with him and said that he would not know normal consensus pain literally, as he would only have his experiences to reference. Chucky told him he remembers always having bloody noses, accusing Pappy of possessing him with this evil spirit. He told Pappy you used to say a prayer to summon him, and I would feel my scar on my cheek start to open. Pappy said he had enough and showed Chucky to the door.

Chucky left, unsatisfied and in tears as he will never get closure on this story. Pappy returned to pour himself another drink. As he poured it, a creature walked in and told him good job on not being suspicious. Pappy bowed down towards Mr Fongro and offered his cut on his hand he had from doing garage work. Mr Fongro gladly took it, and as he absorbed the pain and suffering endured, Pappy told him it pleased him to serve him. Mr Fongro told him that it was a good appetizer but nothing like Chucky's nose bleeds.",2,1760670051.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Eventually, she suggested we explore the city together.

We went for coffee and a movie (her plan). She was really touchy, held my hand, and after the movie we went to the beach and a club. Amazing time ‚Äî felt like an unspoken date. After that, I started liking her.

We kept chatting and meeting after work. One day she mentioned bad period pain, and when her friend gave her flowers she said, ‚ÄúI wish I got this often.‚Äù I surprised her with orchids and chocolates; she was really happy and even posted a thank-you with a heart.

Then things changed. She had a rough few days due to her periods, so we couldn‚Äôt meet. When I asked to meet again, she agreed but fell asleep ‚Äî I got a bit cold over text, saying she could just tell me if she wasn‚Äôt interested. She called and explained she was exhausted, asked me not to overthink.

Since then, things feel off. She‚Äôs colder, I feel like I‚Äôm the one chasing now. She still talks sometimes and shows interest, but the spark‚Äôs fading. We‚Äôll both be away for the festive break soon.

Am I being too clingy? Should I give her more space or try to reconnect? I really want this to work ‚Äî any advice?

Trying to stop. Plan is: sell the random stuff, budget hard (no ""I earned this"" excuse), throw next 2 paychecks at the high-rate cards, maybe try cash envelopes? idk.

If anyone actually beat the shopping spiral - how?

Order of ops is simple for my to follow. Clear collections, try a zero percent transfer if I can, minimums on loans, throttle spending.

1o8q2y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWayHomeHallmark/comments/1o8q2y7/time_travel_books/,Time travel books,"Over a year ago, I wrote a post listing [some of my favorite time travel books](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWayHomeHallmark/comments/1cez44h/time_travel_books/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and asking everyone to share some of their own.

Has anyone read new books they'd like to add to the list? Or maybe they weren't yet TWH fans at the time of my original post (or simply not on Reddit, haha),

Therefore I'm going to list both the books I mentioned before as well as some of the newer ones I've come across below.

Let's help one another pass the time until S4!

* **Before the Coffee Gets Cold** series by **Toshikazu Kawaguchi** \- Set in modern Tokyo, these stories center around a mysterious cafe which allows patrons to time travel...but only according to a long list of specific rules (e.g. You can't leave the cafe (or even the specific seat), you can only meet people who have previously visited the cafe, you can't do anything to change the past or future, and of course, you can only stay until your coffee becomes cold.) Some people think it's not even worth bothering to try. But some wise ones have learned that while they can't officially change things, they *can* change their understanding of people and events.
* **Morna's Legacy** series by **Bethany Claire** \- This collection of books all involve either modern-day women or women of past centuries with various romantic and other issues who somehow manage to slip into centuries-past Scotland or come to the 21st century - wherever it is that their soulmate exists. This is all thanks to Morna, a kind-hearted witch who wants everyone to find love and happiness. Various characters are interconnected to one another throughout the series.
* **Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children** (and sequels) by **Ransom Riggs** \- Sixteen-year-old Jacob travels to a remote island off the coast of Wales after his beloved grandfather's death, intrigued by the stories he heard growing up about his grandfather's life during WWII in an orphanage. Only to Jacob's shock, it seems that both Miss Peregrine and his grandfather's young friends are still exactly as they were so many decades ago. It's then that Jacob learns the truth - his grandfather had some unusual abilities, as does Jacob. It's now the teenager's duty to help the peculiars fight the evil that's been threatening to take over the world since time began.
* **The Time Traveler's Wife** by **Audrey Niffenegger** \- This story centers upon the relationship between Henry, a man with a strange genetic disorder that causes him to time travel involuntarily, and his wife Clare. Starting when he's five years old, Henry begins randomly going backward and forward in his own timeline, never knowing where he's going or for how long. (As Clare is seven years younger, it means Henry first meets her as a child...)
* Anything by¬†**John Heldt**¬†is wonderful! He's written about 20 books about various characters having to TT in various scenarios, and they are all really good (and really inexpensive! The ebooks are just a few dollars each and often have a few days where certain ones are free.) But if you want something that brings TWH to mind, you'll enjoy¬†**Mercer Street**, which centers upon a grandmother, mother and college-age daughter who go back in time to befriend grandma's young parents and infant self. (Albert Einstein has a cameo!)
* **Once Beyond a Time**¬†by¬†**Ann Tatlock**¬†\- A troubled family moves from Philadelphia to an isolated mountain community in North Carolina for a fresh start. They quickly learn that time as they know it does not seem to exist in their new home - which has sheltered many people in the past and in the future, all of whom seem to appear and disappear at random. Then their 8-year-old son goes missing. How can they possibly know where to find him?
* **Whisper Falls**¬†series by¬†**Elizabeth Langston**¬†\- Follows the relationship between Mark, a modern-day 18-year-old in Raleigh, NC, and Susanna, a 17-year-old indentured servant from 1796 who realize they are able to see one another when in a certain spot near a waterfall. The two struggle with the aftermath of attempting to make Susanna a new life in Mark's world.

YA/kids' books, for those who enjoy the genre or want to suggest reading materials to kids who enjoy the show:

* **The Hunky-Dory Dairy** by **Anne Lindbergh** \- Zannah, an 11-year-old girl living with her widowed mom Patty in 1980s Washington, DC, accidentally hitches a ride in a milkman's delivery van into a magical dairy farm where life remains in the 1880s. Soon Zannah and Patty are wrapped up in a world full of new friends and experiences - for both themselves and their 19th-century acquaintances. (In a moment of hilarity, Zannah teaches her new BFF Utopia ""99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall"", while Patty shows up one day wearing a t-shirt reading ""A Woman Needs a Man Like a Fish Needs a Bicycle"".)
* **Time Travelers series**¬†by¬†**Caroline B. Cooney**¬†\- Teens Annie and Strat accidentally meet and fall in love, over 100 years apart. Even worse, Annie's family is just ""ordinary"", while Strat's is one of the wealthiest in the area, actual town founders. Their story takes them through many years and places, as they struggle to find each other.
* **Picturing Alyssa**¬†by¬†**Alison Lohans**¬†\- Whenever 12-year-old Alyssa looks at an old photo of her great-grandparents' family on their Iowa farm in the 1930s, she is able to transport herself into their world. Considering her own home is currently full of grief, Alyssa is happy to be able to visit, especially with her new friend Deborah - aka her 12-year-old grandma. However, as time goes on and Alyssa knows the family's future when they do not, she finds it difficult not to intervene.
* **The Freedom Maze**¬†by¬†**Delia Sherman**¬†\- While spending the summer of 1960 at her grandmother's Louisiana home, 13-year-old Sophie accidentally stumbles into the property's plantation past of 1860 - where her own ancestors mistake her for a slave.",7,1760669710.0,TheWayHomeHallmark,3,1.0,False

(Before he was arrested) He‚Äôs likely already out,"James Ring killed his 9 week old daughter Aria by shaking her violently when he was only alone with her for 17 minutes. He had also hit the back of her head two weeks before she was killed.

From ages 15-18 I knew James. I‚Äôm Afew years younger than him, He was known in the group as ‚ÄúPanda‚Äù. We were the outcast group and used to drink together. Once I was 16 we had started a ‚Äúintimate‚Äù connection (not romantic). 
I met him through a friend group. We started going over to the adult members of the groups homes as they would buy us alcohol and let us drink there. (The older people were in their twenties). 
We grew apart when I was 18 but then he got back in contact many months later through Snapchat when I was at university. I knew he had recently had a child and he explained she had passed on from an illness, I had a huge amount of sympathy for him. He also told a story about how the mother refused to have him at the funeral due to ‚Äúbitterness) which I believed . We planned to meet up for coffee/drink but suddenly he went quiet, I assumed he lost interest but then 1-2 weeks later when I was home from university I saw the news that he had been arrested for killing his daughter Aria. I had to run to the bathroom to be sick.
His sentence was 8 years so he‚Äôs likely out already. 

I never saw any major warning signs. I try look back but I just can‚Äôt remember anything that would indicate he could do this. A year later his friend Lee Vernon got arrested for killing his son, Lee got sentenced to life. I had met Lee afew times but wouldn‚Äôt class him as a friend at any point. 

I am posting about this to bring more attention to the case. Him only getting 8 years and likely got out on good behaviour earlier. People should be aware of his actions incase he ends up in their location.

Three had just gotten out of exhausting, confusing, emotionally draining ‚Äúsituationships‚Äù with guys who weren‚Äôt outright terrible but left them feeling anxious, insecure, and, in their words, ‚Äúnot like myself anymore.‚Äù¬†



It‚Äôs wild how common this is. On TikTok and IG, you‚Äôll see endless ‚Äúhot takes‚Äù about red flags like ‚Äúhe orders milk at dinner‚Äù or ‚Äúhe doesn‚Äôt like dogs‚Äù but no one‚Äôs talking about the deeper psychological patterns that actually mess with your attachment system. So here's a breakdown based on real research, podcasts from actual experts (not random 22-year-olds going viral for saying one outrageous thing), and books that made me rethink my entire approach to dating.¬†



Here‚Äôs your no-BS guide to spotting red flags early, even if the guy seems charming, funny, and has a nice Spotify playlist.¬†



**- Constant ‚Äúfuture faking‚Äù in the first few weeks**

If they start planning trips, naming future kids, or talking about ‚Äúsoulmates‚Äù by week 2, your nervous system might think ‚Äúconnection,‚Äù but it‚Äôs often a manipulation strategy. Dr. Ramani Durvasula (clinical psychologist) talks about this in her lectures on narcissistic traits. It creates false intimacy fast. The goal? To get you emotionally hooked before you even know who he is.



**- He mirrors your personality a little too perfectly**

At first, it feels magical. He loves what you love. Same shows, same books, ""wow we're so alike."" But mirroring can be a tactic. According to ‚ÄúThe Love Bombing Trap‚Äù episode on the podcast ‚ÄúNavigating Narcissism,‚Äù toxic partners often do this to win trust. It‚Äôs not emotional synchronicity. It‚Äôs strategic mimicry.



**- You feel insecure... but you can‚Äôt explain why**

If you start doubting yourself more around them, or find yourself constantly trying to ‚Äúbe better‚Äù to get their attention, that‚Äôs a huge red flag. A 2021 study in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships found that emotionally manipulative people often use subtle invalidations to lower their partner‚Äôs self-esteem. It‚Äôs not what they say, it‚Äôs how they make you feel over time.



**- They never take responsibility, even for small things**

Watch how they react when something minor goes wrong, a restaurant running late, a wrong coffee order. Do they blame others? Do they get passive-aggressive? Dr. Harriet Lerner (clinical psychologist and author of ‚ÄúThe Dance of Anger‚Äù) says poor conflict repair is one of the biggest markers of emotional immaturity. If they never say ‚Äúsorry, that was on me,‚Äù run.



**- Everything is a little too vague**

They talk about their ‚Äúcrazy ex‚Äù but won‚Äôt give details. You don‚Äôt know where they stand on anything real. They dodge questions with jokes or change the subject. This ambiguity is a control tactic. It keeps you off balance. Therapist Nedra Tawwab calls this ‚Äúwithholding clarity,‚Äù and it‚Äôs a form of emotional manipulation.



**- They get close fast‚Ä¶ but pull away when you need support**

In attachment research (referenced heavily by Dr. Amir Levine in ‚ÄúAttached‚Äù), this pattern is called ‚Äúanxious-avoidant trap.‚Äù They come on strong, then disappear emotionally when you‚Äôre vulnerable. It activates your attachment wounds and makes you chase. It‚Äôs not love. It‚Äôs a dopamine rollercoaster.



**- They say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too sensitive‚Äù when you express how you feel**

Classic gaslight move. If you bring up a boundary or discomfort and they twist it into a character flaw, that‚Äôs emotional invalidation. Bren√© Brown (researcher and author) describes this as a way emotionally immature people deflect accountability. If someone can‚Äôt respect your emotional reality, they‚Äôre not safe.



If those hit too close, here are some resources (books, apps, podcasts) to help you figure out who‚Äôs actually safe to open up to, and how to protect your energy.



**- Book: ‚ÄúAttached‚Äù by Dr. Amir Levine & Rachel Heller**¬†¬†

NYT Bestseller. Based on decades of attachment theory research. Explains why we get stuck in patterns with emotionally unavailable people. It helped me understand why I felt addicted to people who didn‚Äôt treat me well. This book will make you question everything you think you know about modern dating. Best psychological dating book I‚Äôve ever read.



**- Book: ‚ÄúThe Gift of Fear‚Äù by Gavin de Becker**¬†¬†

National bestseller. De Becker is a security specialist who explains how intuition is your best self-defense tool. Not about dating per se, but teaches you how to listen to subtle warning signs your body picks up before your brain does. Insanely good read if you want to sharpen your gut instincts.



**- Podcast: ‚ÄúNavigating Narcissism‚Äù with Dr. Ramani**¬†¬†

Dr. Ramani is the queen of red flag education. She breaks down toxic relationship patterns with zero fluff and all science. Her episode on trauma bonds and love bombing should be required listening. Powerfully validating for anyone who‚Äôs ever felt confused by someone who ‚Äúseemed nice.‚Äù



**- Book: ‚ÄúDifficult Personalities‚Äù by Dr. Helen McGrath and Hazel Edwards**¬†¬†

This one‚Äôs lesser known but so good. Helps you identify toxic traits early and gives scripts to handle them. It‚Äôs super practical, not abstract theory. It gave me language for stuff I used to just call ‚Äúweird vibes.‚Äù Game changer.



**- App: BeFreed**¬†¬†

An AI-powered self-awareness trainer built by Columbia grads. It turns books, expert interviews, and real-life case studies into audio learning journeys you can do during a commute or walk. You can pick the voice you want to hear, choose podcast lengths (10, 20, or 40 mins), and it builds a tailored learning roadmap over time. It‚Äôs basically a therapist-meets-audiobook-club for busy people. Their relationship and emotional regulation modules are solid. Also has all the books and podcasts I mentioned above.



**- YouTube: The School of Life**¬†¬†

They‚Äôve got short, poetic breakdowns of emotional red flags, emotional maturity, and psychology in relationships. The video ‚ÄúWhy You Keep Falling for Emotionally Unavailable People‚Äù is a must-watch. It nails the psychology in under 10 minutes.



**- Podcast: ‚ÄúTherapy Chat‚Äù with Laura Reagan**¬†¬†

She interviews top trauma-informed therapists about emotional safety, boundary setting, and how childhood patterns play into adult relationships. Less pop-psych, more real strategy with warmth and nuance. Great for people who want tools that are both compassionate and firm.



**- Book: ‚ÄúSet Boundaries, Find Peace‚Äù by Nedra Glover Tawwab**¬†¬†

NYT Bestseller. Therapist-backed. Clear, no-nonsense guide to identifying your limits and holding them, even if people guilt-trip you. If you grew up people-pleasing or minimizing your needs, this book will hit hard, in the best way.



This isn‚Äôt about judging anyone too fast. A lot of red flags only become obvious once you‚Äôve already started catching feelings. But if you have the tools to notice the pattern early, you can save yourself months, or years, of emotional whiplash. Real safety in a relationship feels calm, clear, and consistent. No butterflies, no confusion bombs, no games. Just peace. And you deserve that.",1,1760669355.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False
1o8pyg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LookOutsideGame/comments/1o8pyg2/story/,Story,"Love the game and world of Look Outside, so figured I would start writing a story about it.  Let me know what you think!


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

He heard the errant buzzing of his phone before anything else.  That god-awful sound, so despised for its role in ripping him from sleep (which was as close as he got to happy in the last few months), still as vile as always.  He opened his eyes to stare blankly at the rough plaster ceiling of his bedroom for several minutes, corralling his thoughts into something resembling the motivation to climb out of bed.  After waiting roughly ten minutes, he thought to himself that the world wasn‚Äôt about to instantly end, leaving him with no other option than to sit up and pry himself from his cocoon of questionably hygienic sheets and onto his feet.  After a small stretch, he yawned and looked around, scratching his stubble as looked around his room absent mindedly.  
It was the room of Erik White, a 36 year old who had spent the last few months absentmindedly drifting through life, simply existing from day-to-day in a depressing fog.  It hadn‚Äôt always been this way.  He used to have a life, a career, dreams, hopes, aspirations.  The first of his family to go too medical school, but the next in a long line of dedicated patriots and military family members.  Five years ago, the world was his.  But then he got sick.  And in a life that runs on strength, endurance and consistent razor sharp mental aptitude, having to spend so much time in medication induced stupors for his failing health left little room choice.  Quite unceremoniously, he was dropped from the government quite unceremoniously at the beginning of this year to pursue his life of disability. 
Sure, he pulled in a meage disability salary, but each time he saw that check deposited in the bank, he imagined that this is how a drug-addict having to rely on alimony from a successful partner who wished for nothing more than that they be run over by a bus.  It just made him feel dirty, even though he knew he couldn‚Äôt stop his intestines from rotting.  This did nothing to supplement what little dignity and self-esteem he had managed to smuggle on his way out of service, and what he did have slowly faded away as he spent more and more time inside, avoiding reality far too much to ever be healthy.
As his gaze travelled over his desk and computer, it was drawn back to his still buzzing phone. 

===SEVERE WEATHER ALERT===SEVERE WEATHER ALERT===THIS IS NOT A DRILL===STAY INDOORS===SEVERE WEATHER ALERT===

Erik groaned, shutting off the notification and looking at his window.  It was currently covered in several clumsily applied layers of curtains of dubious quality, allowing for a small amount of light in while not allowing him to see outside.  From the looks of it, it was‚Ä¶
He paused and thought quizzickly ‚Äúwhat the hell does it look like outside?‚Äù  
Based off of the light coming through the sides and landing on his walls and ceilings, he could swear it looked like the sun was beginning to shine‚Ä¶or was it setting?  No, that‚Äôs not right, is it cloudy out?  The color appeared to change, yet remained consistently unchanged at the same time.  His curiosity piqued, he walked to the window and grabbed the blinds to check. 

THUD THUD THUD

The noise caused him to jump about a foot into the air.  Not expecting any deliveries, and having outlived the patience of most of his friends, visitors (barring food deliveries, of course) were few and far between at Erik‚Äôs apartment.  The sound of knocking at his front door somehow rattled him, especially with the ferocity of the knocks.

Christ alive, calm down asshole.  I‚Äôm coming, I‚Äôm coming. Thought Erik as he opened his bedroom door and strode across the living room to his front door.  He kicked aside some game cases and books as he rounded his couch, guided only by the dull, comforting red light illuminating a large terrarium in the corner of the room.
As he got to the door, he looked through the eyehole, expecting to find what sounded like a pissed off land lord.  But there was nothing‚Ä¶?

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Erik called through the door.  Listening for a second, he heard nothing. After confirming that no one was there, he assumed he must have heard someone knocking on one of his neighbors doors instead.  The walls here were notoriously thin, as the couple next door continued to remind him, week after agonizing week.  Nothing like the sound of someone walking through mac and cheese‚Ä¶Erik thought with annoyance, wishing that they would go to her place every once and a while.  Or was it his?  Whatever.

‚ÄúSup Bro?‚Äù Erik said, walking over to the doors of the terrarium and gazing inside.  Adorning the terrarium innards appeared to be some jungle mock up, with all sorts and leaves, branches and hammocks.  From a large lego temple Erik had built as an excuse not to get rid of whatever childhood toys he clung too, poked the questioning snout of a small python.  

‚ÄúI wish I could be like you Banana Sam, just lounging in your rock, not a care in the world.‚Äù

Banana Sam continued to look at Erik, as if silently asking ‚ÄúThis is what you woke me for?‚Äù before sliding back into his house.  

‚ÄúFine, I‚Äôll just go play games on my own.‚Äù  He walked over to the couch and grabbed the remote before shouting ‚ÄúYou ASS!‚Äù at his snake.  As Erik started up one of his favorite games, Johnny Kickass, and proceeded to reach over his coffee table and grab a small box, from which he procured a cigar of the potent, soporific variety.

Soporific.

He giggled as he smoked, enveloping the room in a narcotic haze.

Soporific.  Hah.  What a word‚Ä¶

THUD THUD THUD

This time he really did jump a foot into the air, nearly breaking his neck as he swung around to stare wide-eyed at the door.  All was quite for several seconds, before Erik broke the silence as diplomatically and as calmly as he could.

‚ÄúWHAT THE FUCK MAN?!‚Äù Silence.

Eric swung around and jumped over his couch, landing on his feet.  Halfway to door, it happened again.  But this time, it sounded farther away, like there was pounding down the hall.  Paranoia crept up his spawn, causing his stomach to sink, however whether his paranoia was real or drug induced, he wasn‚Äôt sure.  As he made his way towards the door and placed his eye against the hole, his paranoia slowly heightened.  
From the looks of it, there appeared to be a mess outside, as if someone had had a fight.  Or thrown a party?  There was trash scattered about the hallway outside, and there were several dents in the wall, as if someone had been aggressively punching holes in the walls.

Fucking kids or skids man. He thought to himself.
Not really being the neighborly type, he only knew a few of his building mates, and even then only because of their dogs.  What he did know was that they weren‚Äôt always the most pleasant appearing people, so he usually kept his head low, preferring to avoid hassle where he could.  In fact, there had used to be one couple that were in some band.  Erik was pretty sure that they had overdosed or died quickly though, because they disappeared a while ago.  The boyfriend did look pretty into fire‚Ä¶
Bracing himself, he slowly opened the door and peered outside.  The hallway stretched on in both directions.  To his left, after several doors was the stairwell, elevators, and all the janitorial/custodial equipment.  It looked like more evidence of whatever party, fight, tornado, etc. had swept through the hallway.  Erik squinted.

Is that a body? No, it can‚Äôt be.  I‚Äôm just high.

But the longer he looked at that lump of trash in the corner by the stairwell‚Ä¶

No, no, no.  It‚Äôs just some drunk skid sleeping it off.  Calm down.

But he couldn‚Äôt calm down.  The longer he looked, the more the lump in the back of his throat rose.  It wasn‚Äôt just the shape of the trash either, it was the fact that the lights flickering on-and-off were really giving him a very ‚ÄúSerial killer‚Äù movie vibe.  Were the shadows‚Ä¶dancing?  Moving?  He opened his mouth the call out, just to ease his mind and maybe-

WHAM

The sound echoed from down the hall to Erik‚Äôs right.  As his head swung towards the sound, he tried to make sense of what he could see in the dim light.
The hallway continued on for several doors before disappearing into inky darkness.  He could see the light of vending machine glowing in the dark, what looked like 10, maybe 15 doors down, but it failed to illuminate anything other than itself.  In his soporific stupor, he failed to realize how strange it was that the hallway stretched so far‚Ä¶
In fact, his attention was immediately grabbed two things.  The first was the shape.  It appears that the vending machine was, in fact, illuminating more than itself.  At the edge of visible site appeared a tall, gaunt shape.  It appeared to be leaning out of a doorway, but that wasn‚Äôt what caused the hackles on his neck to rise.  It was‚Ä¶the eyes.  At least, that‚Äôs what he assumed they were.  Two barely visible pin pricks of light, but yet when Erik brought himself to look directly at them, he felt like someone walking over his grave.
The second thing he noticed was the door across the hall and about three down was wide open, with the door loosely hanging on its hinges.  Erik was pretty sure that was apartment 4371, but again he was extremely high.  As he opened his door and made his way down the hall, his feet came into contact with the strewn about trash. Unfortunately, as was mentioned, he was extremely high.  Which is probably why he immediately forgot the first, much more important and dangerous thing to instinctively grab a heavy metal pipe on the ground.  As he straightened back up and held it aloft, ready to clumsily strike, he suddenly realized he didn‚Äôt remember why he grabbed the pipe in the first place.  He gazed down into the depths of the hallway, pipe aloft, but there was nothing but the glow and hum of that far-flung vending machine.  

‚ÄúHello?  Is anyone there?‚Äù Erik called out.  Nothing.
He crept forward toward the gaping hole in the wall that was apartment 4371.  As he slowly rounded the doorway, he saw the inside of another apartment, lit only by a window in the far wall.  There was someone standing at the window, staring out.  As Erik rounded the corner, the figure must have heard the shuffle of feet and snapped the blinds closed.

‚ÄúHello?  Are you okay?‚Äù  

The figure, still standing facing the window, slowly turned his head and looked at Erik with an impassive stare.  Several seconds of deafening silence followed, before a wide grin broke out across their face as they said softly-

‚ÄúDid you look outside yet?‚Äù

Tomorrow I will be told his diagnosis, and I feel everyone in our life has an opinion if he is diagnosed as having ADHD. This post is to ask if any parents had similar thoughts before starting a specific method with their child. 

My son‚Äôs biological father has ADHD and would tell me horror stories of him when was on Ritalin. That he never wanted to eat or was ‚Äúzombie‚Äù like but his mom always pushed it. He said he hated it. He‚Äôs no longer in the picture but this idea always worried me if it was that horrible. 

My son‚Äôs step dad doesn‚Äôt know much about ADHD and says he‚Äôll agree with what I say but his mom who recently got diagnosed, says her Adderall is amazing and improves her life everyday. Which I do agree helps her but I feel everyone is different. 

His teacher has suggested that other parents have given them coffee or mt dew before school and helps. I mentioned this to my sons step grandma and she told me she‚Äôs given him some energy drink without me knowing and it calmed him down. I really disapproved of not telling me or an energy drink, but I understand the action of the sugar doing the opposite. 

My family says do what his doctor wants who said he should be on meds no matter what if diagnosed. But my family also says they want him ‚Äúcalm, because he‚Äôs too much to handle sometimes for them.‚Äù I‚Äôve done many field placements for teaching classes and every student I saw did struggle while being on meds. 

My aunt takes adderall daily for her ADHD and she is constantly running around cleaning or very ‚Äúhyper‚Äù or ‚Äújittery‚Äù which I thought it did the opposite but don‚Äôt like how she acts when on it. Very ‚Äúrude, and conspiracy theory.‚Äù And says to make sure my son gets a high dose of Adderall to start. 

2 years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD by a very elderly doctor who recently retired and he put me on meds right away. But I also feel he didn‚Äôt diagnose me correctly so I‚Äôve never taken meds and yet I know ADHD symptoms are very different per individual, I‚Äôve never encountered anything similar to my son. I take anxiety medication and that helped my symptoms that my doctor said was adhd. So I wonder too if stress/anxious topics from the school day can be a factor to my son too. 

I‚Äôve researched doing sports or other activities can help extremely to burn energy and try to attempt to make the mind focus on that. But is it enough for him to focus better in school to try and help listen or not run around constantly. He loves to run so I feel track or soccer would be perfect for him. 

Any thoughts? Either way our son is very bright but would like to support him in the best ways possible. ",1,1760669327.0,Mom,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôve (30 f) been living in Jijel for a while now, but I‚Äôve had a really hard time making friends here. I‚Äôm a teacher, and my work setting doesn‚Äôt really give me the chance to meet people who share my interests or worldview.

I‚Äôm married and have a little one, so I‚Äôm not looking for anything other than genuine friendship, just someone to hang out with, chat, maybe grab a coffee, or go shopping together.

I of course am only interested in other women (no men) who live in Jijel, speak English, and most importantly not religious. It‚Äôd be nice to have someone to talk to openly about life, movies and tv shows, our relationships or anything really.

If this sounds like you, feel free to DM me, it would be great to finally make a friend here.

Except in my case if anything takes over my life to the point where there‚Äôs no room in my life for anything else I start to resent it eventually, no matter how interesting it is.

I guess I‚Äôm just lazy. I used to be an actual person before I seriously started my career. I loved reading and used to read novel after novel. I used to draw a lot and have quite an extensive portfolio. I was actually kind of *good*.  I once was super active and camped, hiked, swam and canoed on a regular basis. I felt so much more alive back then.

It‚Äôs all I have time for. Most of the time I don‚Äôt even have time to make full meals (I used to love cooking) and just grab a granola bar or something and wash it down with coffee. Sometimes all I have is coffee.  I hardly sleep at all these days. No time. I‚Äôm up by 7 at the latest and don‚Äôt get to go to bed until 3 am, sometimes later because I need to maximize my productivity.

I‚Äôm becoming a shell of myself and I think I now understand why older people are so miserable. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs all to do with age-related decline, it‚Äôs because we are being worked to *death*. 

And god forbid you actually do have free time every once in a while and don‚Äôt use it for work or studies because everyone will criticize you for being lazy! And you get shamed for staying home from work when sick.

Other people seem to find this lifestyle rewarding. Well I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôd love my career and studies a lot more if I was just given more than a day to accomplish major projects! If I could just have a *little* bit of downtime here and there. 

While I do enjoy my work I need time to rest and I‚Äôm not getting it which is fucking draining. I don‚Äôt get how other people tolerate living like this, let alone love it so much they say they wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.",2,1760668683.0,rant,3,1.0,False

It‚Äôs all of our first time building cameras, setting up a darkroom, and developing images, and we‚Äôre learning the whole process together, which has been rad.

Last week, we captured some beautiful images for beginners, including a couple double exposures that turned out nicely (like the first image). Today, using the same cameras under similar light conditions, our photos came out as a blurry, incoherent mess. The second image was taken with the same camera as the first.

Our cameras are simple coffee cans with aluminum pinholes and a piece of black gaffer tape as the shutter. (The circular shapes on the paper are from magnets holding the photo paper inside the can.) We used the Mr. Pinhole calculator to size our pinholes and have been documenting exposure times and lighting conditions carefully.

Are there any clues in the second image that might reveal what went wrong? My best guesses are the pinhole got dented, warped, or otherwise damaged (maybe a dropped can), or some students are trying for ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù shots - like triple exposures - without realizing how to pull them off‚Ä¶",2,1760668342.0,PinholePhotography,0,1.0,False

eyes gleaming with a curiosity

‚ÄúDid we become what we dreamed of?‚Äù

I sighed, stirring sugar

with eyes that felt far too tired

‚ÄúNo, but we became stronger,‚Äù I said

He frowned

‚ÄúDo we still write? Still believe in love?‚Äù
I smiled

Tracing the cups rim

Some pages still ache even if the ink runs quiter

He sipped the bitter coffee

with a look of disdain

‚ÄúIt gets easier,‚Äù I said

‚ÄúWe learn to take it without sugar‚Äù

of things

of the backstabs waiting in warm rooms

I can barely remember what I am doing, and often get distracted, or forget what the heck I was doing. Resulting in....insanity. But....I am loving it! 

I am definitely starting to struggle with deciding what to do/build next.

Those contemplating visiting Seoul, South Korea, might consider visiting Sungkyunkwan University (est in 1398 CE). It is minutes away from the Main Palaces in Seoul in Insadong. Of course, this scholarly place of learning was the inspiration for the Korean Drama **Sungkyunkwan Scandal (2010)**. The oldest structures are cradled in by modern day structures which now house the main University. However, the feel of hollowed ground is experienced as one tours these old structures. This is the place from which scholars would come in mass to the Palace to petition Rulers.

As things would go, I got lost along the way and needed directions. I approached a student seemingly mumbling to herself and hoped that she knew English (My Korean is sparse). To my surprise, she spoke perfect English and was practicing for her English proficiency test which she would take in one hour. Her name was Seowon. I made a pact with her that if she gave me directions I would drill her for her test. She agreed. For the next half hour, she got to speak English with a native and I got a campus tour, win win situation. Her English was impeccable. She could even pronounce my name like a native. My name contains an r, a letter Koreans have difficulty pronouncing. Seowon nailed it. Seowon was studying Social Sciences and Diplomacy at the University, perhaps one day to be a Diplomat. I told her that if one day I saw her on TV being escorted as part of the Korean Diplomatic contingency I would be able to tell people that I helped her pass her English proficiency exam. Seowon laughed.

It is an anachronism to hear American rap songs being played in Student Centers and English Speaking Korea Boy Band songs playing in the coffee shop where I am writing this piece.

Original post

I am curious how long men typically wait to ask about a second date. 

In this situation, first date was a quick meeting for coffee, lasted about an hour and a half and went well. During the date he made mention of a place he had been to recently that he thought I might like, if we were to go out again. I mentioned I would like that. 
We ended with a hug and he said something along the lines of making plans and we said we would message. 
He messaged me that night after the date and said he enjoyed meeting in person and he forgot to show me some pics he had taken. 
I messaged back saying I also enjoyed meeting him and maybe we would get the chance for him to show me another time. 
That was 5 days ago and no message back, nothing.

I know this is an old issue dating back to as far as battlefield 3, but it should be addressed. 

I have already seen people setting up macros to quarantine them getting an attack helicopter every time it spawns. Even after they get shot down and die, they can activate macro, go pour them self cup of coffee and get another one when it spawns.

There needs to be some kind of system to prevent your entire squad from getting same vehicle again for the first 5 seconds of it spawning if you were previously killed while using it. This gives other squads fair chance to play with said vehicle.

Also Nato's side isn't getting some of their vehicles on couple of maps while PAX gets theirs. Leading to very one sided Conquest matches.",2,1760667470.0,Battlefield,0,0.67,False
