","“You need to let me go” she said,

Why?

Because you just have to.

But I don't want to.

You have to try, my love.

Please, don’t call me that.

The world isn’t the same anymore, and you need to brace yourself for what’s ahead. If you keep trying to build with the old, crumbling bricks of yesterday, everything will fall apart, and you'll be buried beneath the ruins.

You always know what to say, don’t you?

She let out a soft, bittersweet chuckle. ""Baby, it's only fair. Let go of the rope... the water isn’t as cold as you think.""

“Alright,” I muttered, though every fiber of my being resisted.

As I stepped into the water, I found that she was right—the temperature was mild, almost welcoming, just as she had said. She was always right, always so damn sure of everything. She didn’t need glasses to prove she was smart; it radiated from her in ways that made you feel small, insignificant.

“I think it’s time to go home!” I yelled, the desperation clinging to my words.

But there was no response, just the quiet echo of my own voice mingling with the gentle lapping of the water. I looked around, searching for her, but she was gone, vanished like a ghost that had never been real to begin with. The warmth of the water suddenly felt like ice, creeping into my bones, chilling me to the core.

*Home*. The word felt hollow, meaningless. Without her, home was just a place—a collection of walls and memories that were slowly disintegrating, just like the bricks she had warned me about. I stood there, ankle-deep in the water, realizing that I was alone in every sense of the word, and the truth of it was suffocating. The rope had slipped from my hands, and now I was adrift, without her to anchor me.

I had to let go, but instead of relief, all I felt was the crushing weight of loss. I was tearing myself apart every day, if only I had her again, if I could relive the life I once knew but I needn’t prose. The ropes indeed hang to keep us all awake, I should have known. Life just isn’t the same old song anymore.

*If only we had lived together in a universe that had favored us.* Maybe I just needed to feel the warmth of the sun again and so I did. I grabbed my keys and got in my car.

Outside, the world was beautiful, it was intricate and peaceful, the bustling sound of the traffic, children playing on the streets, it was refreshing for once. I decided to go for a cup of coffee, maybe it would freshen up my mind, bring me back to the world I once loved. I pulled up into the parking lot of the small autistic café in town. It was a cute place, the freshly baked coffee beans, crumbs of the croissants and donuts made me feel hungry and I was surprised too. It had been too long since I had enjoyed my meal.

“Hi, my name is Emily, how can I help you sir?”

The petite barista smiled at me, “Two large black coffees and one of those glazed donuts”

“That’ll be $4.99”

I used my card to pay, I hadn’t time to even withdraw cash from the ATM. I don’t need cash to where I’m going

“Here’s your receipt sir, there’s a surprise at the bottom!”

In my slumber, I hadn’t realized that she was flirting with me and had written her number on the bottom of the receipt, I smiled;

“Do you know how old I am?”

She chuckled; “I like older men”

“Maybe try again in another life” I said as I showed her my wedding ring.

“Aww shucks”

I waited in the brown leather booth in the far corner of the café. Its aura was quite gay but eccentric, feeding off from the energy of the customers who seemed all busy in their everyday lives. To the nerd with the glasses who typed away at his laptop to the casual meeting being held with the full suited men. It kind of reminded me of the life I lived, I was once too busy in my own life….*with her*. The café would have felt dead if it wasn’t for the smiles of the first date sharing a strawberry smoothie together.

I picked up my order and got in my car, the engine roared and came to life. I fixed my GPS to where I had last seen her. It was going to be just like our first date.

\*\*\*

I checked my watch again. Five minutes had passed since the last time I looked, but it felt like an eternity. The café was bustling with the usual weekend crowd, the clatter of cups and murmur of conversation filling the air, but I barely noticed any of it. My eyes kept darting to the door, scanning the faces that walked in, hoping to catch a glimpse of her.

""You're really nervous, aren’t you?"" Jake, my best friend, leaned back in his chair, a smirk playing on his lips. He took a sip of his coffee, completely at ease.

""Shut up,"" I muttered, fidgeting with the napkin in front of me. ""It’s just a first date. No big deal.""

Jake chuckled, shaking his head. ""Yeah, sure. Just a first date with the girl you've been talking about non-stop for the past two weeks.""

I shot him a glare, but he wasn’t wrong. I had been obsessing over this date since the moment we’d set it up. We’d met online, exchanged messages for a while, and now, finally, we were going to meet in person. It felt like a huge step, and the pressure was getting to me. What if she didn’t like me in person? What if we didn’t click the way we did over text?

“Dude, relax. You’ll be fine,” Jake said, as if reading my mind. “Just be yourself.”

“Easy for you to say. You’re just here as a wingman,” I replied, trying to keep my voice light, but the anxiety was creeping in.

Before Jake could respond, the café door opened, and I saw her walk in. My breath hitched. She was even more beautiful than her pictures—long, wavy hair, a warm smile that made her eyes sparkle, and a kind of effortless grace that made her stand out in the crowd. She was with her friend, who looked equally stunning, but my eyes were glued to her.

“There she is,” Jake said, nudging me under the table. “Game time, man.”

I stood up, my heart pounding in my chest as they walked over. “Hi, you must be Emma,” I said, my voice sounding a little too high-pitched for my liking. I cleared my throat, trying to regain some composure.

Emma smiled, and the nervousness I’d felt all morning started to melt away. “Hi, yeah, it’s great to finally meet you in person,” she said, her voice just as soft and kind as I’d imagined.

“This is my friend, Sarah,” she added, gesturing to the woman beside her. Sarah gave a polite nod, and Jake quickly stood up to introduce himself, smoothly taking over the conversation with Sarah, leaving me and Emma to ourselves.

We sat down, and for a moment, I was at a loss for words. All the things I’d planned to say seemed to slip away, leaving my mind blank. But then Emma laughed—a light, musical sound—and the tension broke.

“Nervous?” she asked, her eyes twinkling with amusement.

“Yeah, a little,” I admitted, running a hand through my hair. “But in a good way, I think. I’ve been looking forward to this.”

“Me too,” she said, her smile widening. “It’s funny, I was worried it might be awkward, but I’m glad it’s not.”

“Definitely not,” I agreed, feeling more at ease. “So, what do you think? Is this place okay?”

She glanced around the café, taking in the cozy atmosphere. “It’s perfect. I like the vibe here. It’s casual and gay, but still nice.”

“I’m glad,” I said, relieved that she seemed comfortable. “So, how was your day?”

We started chatting, and the conversation flowed easily, just like it had online. We talked about everything—our jobs, our favorite movies, even our most embarrassing moments. Every now and then, I’d glance over at Jake and Sarah, who seemed to be getting along well, but my focus was on Emma. The more we talked, the more I realized how much I liked her. She was funny, smart, and had this way of making you feel like you were the only person in the room.

At one point, she leaned in a little closer, her voice dropping to a more intimate tone. “You know, I wasn’t sure what to expect, meeting you in person. But I’m really glad I came.”

My heart skipped a beat. “Yeah? Me too. I mean, I was kind of a wreck this morning, but now… this just feels right.”

She smiled, and for a moment, everything else faded away. It was just the two of us, in this little bubble of connection that felt both new and familiar at the same time.

“I hope we can do this again,” I said, feeling a little bolder now that the initial nerves had worn off.

“I’d like that,” she replied, her eyes locking onto mine. “I’d like that a lot.”

The rest of the date went by in a blur. We finished our drinks, laughed at Jake’s terrible jokes, and even made plans to meet up again the next weekend. By the time we left the café, I felt like I was floating on air.

As we said our goodbyes, Emma gave me a quick hug, and I caught a whiff of her perfume—something floral and sweet that lingered in my mind long after she was gone.

“So, how’d it go?” Jake asked as we watched them walk away.

“It was perfect,” I said, unable to stop the smile from spreading across my face. “I think I’m really going to like her.”

Jake clapped me on the back, grinning. “Told you, man. Just be yourself. Looks like it paid off.”

I nodded, still watching the spot where Emma had disappeared around the corner. “Yeah… I think it really did.”

I smiled as the memory faded away, I had blacked out and didn’t realize I was already at my home. She was waiting for me. When I walked inside the house, it felt warm and the smell felt refreshing. She was cooking.

“Make sure to leave your muddy boats at the door babe”

 “And ifn’t I don’t?”

“Then you’ll meet a fate worse than death partner”

I chuckled and kissed her neck, “Hey goodlooking, what’s cooking?”

“I found some leftover meat in the basement freezer so I decided to make steaks for dinner”

“What freezer?”

The night was perfect, at least on the surface. The table was set with our best china, a bottle of red wine breathing on the counter, and the steak resting just the way she liked it—medium-rare, with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. The flicker of candlelight danced on the walls, casting a warm, golden glow over everything. She looked beautiful, sitting there across from me, her smile soft and sweet, like it always was when she was happy. But something felt off. There was a dull ache at the back of my mind, like a distant memory trying to surface.

""Anyways, can you fix the table, honey?"" she asked, her voice gentle but insistent.

I nodded, pushing away the unease. ""Of course,"" I said, getting up to steady the wobbly leg. I could feel her eyes on me as I worked, her gaze like a weight on my shoulders. But I didn’t look up. I just kept my focus on the table, trying to ignore the strange, creeping feeling that something wasn’t right.

Dinner was delicious, as it always was when we cooked together. The steak melted in my mouth, the wine was rich and full-bodied, and the conversation flowed effortlessly, just like it always had. But there was something in her eyes tonight, something distant and cold that I couldn’t quite place. I wanted to ask her about it, but every time I opened my mouth, the words died in my throat. Instead, I just smiled and nodded, pretending everything was normal.

After dinner, we cleaned up together, laughing softly as we washed the dishes and put them away. The whole time, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong, but I kept it to myself. I didn’t want to ruin the evening. Not when everything seemed so perfect.

When we finally climbed into bed, I wrapped my arms around her, pulling her close. She snuggled into me, her body warm and soft against mine, and for a moment, I let myself believe that everything was okay.

“Relax, its over. You belong to me. I want to fill your mouth with dirt”

“What?” She whispered

“Relax, my love. It’s over, now you can never leave, I take your second digit with me”

Just then—a loud crash came from downstairs. My eyes snapped open, my heart pounding in my chest. She stirred beside me, but I gently shushed her, kissing the top of her head.

“Stay here, I’ll check it out,” I whispered, slipping out of bed and grabbing the baseball bat from the closet. The floorboards creaked under my feet as I made my way down the stairs, the darkness closing in around me. The house was quiet, too quiet, and every shadow seemed to move as I passed.

When I reached the kitchen, I saw a figure standing there, shrouded in darkness. My breath caught in my throat as I gripped the bat tighter.

“Who are you?” I demanded, my voice shaking. The figure didn’t move, didn’t speak, just stood there, staring at me with eyes that seemed to glow in the dark. I took a step closer, my heart racing. “I said, who are you?”

“Ethan…” The voice was low, rasping, and familiar. Too familiar.

“What?” I whispered, my heart sinking. “How do you know my name?”

The figure didn’t answer. It just stood there, its eyes locked on mine, its expression twisted with something that looked like pain and it pointed at something, when I looked away to what It was pointing, I heard it—the sound of something moving in the basement, something heavy and slow.

I turned away from the figure, my heart in my throat as I made my way to the basement door. The smell hit me before I even reached the stairs, a putrid, rotting stench that made my stomach turn. I gagged, covering my mouth as I descended into the darkness, the sound growing louder with every step.

When I reached the bottom, I saw him—Jake, tied to a pole in the middle of the room, his body broken and bloodied, his eyes wide with terror. He was dead, skinned alive, and parts of his flesh had been ripped apart, as if something had been feeding on him. But that wasn’t the worst of it.

I stumbled back, my mind reeling, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. And then it all came rushing back which in my slumber, I had forgotten, my wife, her death, and the day I found out about Jake; the rage, the grief, the overwhelming need for revenge. I had captured him, brought him here, and made him suffer for what he’d done. But that wasn’t enough. No, it wasn’t nearly enough.

I had dug her up. My beautiful, sweet wife. I had dug her up from her grave, brought her back here, and pretended that everything was normal, that she was still alive. But she wasn’t. She had been dead for five years. The woman upstairs… was nothing but a rotting corpse, her flesh decaying, her bones brittle and cold.

*I had lost my mind completely.*

I stumbled back up the stairs, the reality of what I had done crashing down on me like a tidal wave. When I reached the bedroom, I saw her—my wife, her body decomposing, lying in our bed. I had been living with a corpse, pretending she was still alive, pretending that everything was okay and everything was okay. She is mine…. She is mine…. *YOU ARE MINE; YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MINE*

*I fell to my knees, my body shaking with sobs, when I heard it—a knock at the door. The police. They had finally come for me and the figure is there no more.*",1,1733170056.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Today was supposed to be uneventful. She had plans to meet her best friend, Sarah, for their weekly coffee date, and later, she intended to work on the novel she had been passionately writing for the past year. 

But as she made her bed and prepared to start her day, a strange sense of fatigue washed over her. It was as if all the energy had been suddenly drained from her body, leaving her limbs heavy and her mind foggy. “That's odd,” she mumbled, rubbing her temples in an attempt to ease the sudden throbbing in her head. She decided that a quick nap might help, so she changed into comfortable clothes and curled up in bed.

As she closed her eyes, her mind began to wander. She found herself in a dark, unfamiliar place, her heart pounding with an unexplainable sense of dread. She tried to call out, but her voice failed her, escaping only as a hoarse whisper. Then, she saw it. A shadowy figure stood at the end of her bed, silent and menacing. Its presence filled the room with an eerie calm, and Lily's breath quickened as she tried to move, but her body felt frozen.

“Who are you?” she mouthed, eyes fixed on the dark silhouette. The figure remained motionless, its eyes locked on hers. Lily's fear intensified as she struggled to reach for her boyfriend, Daniel, who lay sleeping beside her. “Daniel,” she whispered, her voice laced with fear. “Wake up, please...” But Daniel slept on, unaware of the terror that gripped his girlfriend.

The figure took a deliberate step forward, its presence looming over Lily. She felt its weight on the bed as it sat down, pinning her to the mattress. Lily's breath caught in her throat as she tried to scream, but only a weak moan escaped her lips. The figure leaned closer, its face hidden in darkness, its cold breath washing over her.

“Please...” she mouthed, her eyes pleading. In response, the figure grinned, a sinister smile that sent shivers down her spine. It reached out, icy fingers touching her lips, silencing her. Panic surged as she struggled to free herself. Then, it vanished, leaving her alone.

Lily sat up, breathless, scanning the room. Was she losing her mind? She got out of bed, legs weak, and opened the door. “Hello?” she called, her heart pounding. Silence answered. As days passed, the figure returned, its silent watch haunting her.

One night, it advanced, glowing eyes piercing her. “Stay away!” she screamed, but it pushed her against the wall. With a swift touch, darkness engulfed her, and she vanished without a trace. Lily's absence devastated Daniel and Sarah. The police found nothing. In the shadows, the silent watcher remained, eyes aglow, having claimed another soul.

1h545po,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concerta/comments/1h545po/opinion_of_dosage_and_medication_journal_so_far/,Opinion of dosage and Medication Journal so far,"Hello, I started on Concerta 18mg November 20th and am starting to kind of ebb into getting used to it or it potentially being too low. What are your thoughts on medication journal so far and does it make sense that it’s too low or is it a function of getting used to it?

First Day November 20th:

Worked very well.  I started having very high energy and went into work with a mini crisis and was overwhelmed due to the burst of energy provided.  I slowly eliminated the amount of coffee I had knowing that caffeine would be an issue.  I had some bouts of hyperactivity due to the medication, but there bouts of focus I was able to use to be very productive.  I noticed I could pay attention to an audiobook for the whole duration of lunch.  I ended up being focused after work until the end of the day and was able to play a video game I was focused on.

Second Day November 21st:

Again had bouts of hyperactivity but was met with mixes of hyperactivity and focus being able to stay on task

Friday November 22nd:

This was a snow day I was working from home for.  I ended up working through most of my laundry, putting together an entertainment center and completed all of my work tasks for the day.  It felt great having control over what I wanted to do and what I needed to do.  The guilt of not being able to do something was gone.

General Note:

One thing I do notice overall from this point in the medication is a lowered sense of anxiety generally and socially.  I feel a calm when in the presence of people and in my own presence.  In the presence of people and alcohol, I find myself in a lot more control and I've been able to not overindulge, control myself because I am not overwhelmed and can process things in a social environment.

Saturday November 23rd:

I was able to stay on task at home with not a lot of issues overall.  Later in the day my wife had a roller derby game I attended where I was able to be present, socialize with a lot of the people with no anxiety and ended up pouring out my drink of alcohol because I didn't finish it and didn't want to finish it.  I see this as a huge success overall!

Sunday November 24th:

I went to a Christmas Parade for my niece.  I was able to handle everything with ease socially and generally.  It felt amazing.

Monday November 25th:

Handled my work day very well and seem to be more organized overall in terms of my work flow.  I have been able to organize and actually finish my time sheets which is a point of anxiety for me because I always either forget to do it or are overwhelmed by it.

Tuesday November 26th:

Took my pill around 8:05. Ditto from Monday November 25th.  Overall I've had no issues with it but I seem to be increasing my caffeine intake slightly to maintain focus.

Wednesday November 27th:

Took my pill around 8:05. I went through the whole day pretty well with no issues, but the energy levels are slightly lower compared to earlier in the medication process.  I find myself needing two cups of coffee.  Near the end of the night we went out with friends and I found myself staring into space and overall being more anxious than I have been prior around 6 onwards throughout the night.

Thursday November 28th:

I took my pill around 8:30. Thanksgiving Dinner was a great success overall.  I had time with my friends and family and I enjoyed the time with them.  I do notice that I was socially anxious after I left my parent's house around 3:30 leading myself to be slightly anxious and reserved at my wife's parents house later that night.

Friday November 29th:

I have slightly more anxiety as I go through the day moreso from being overwhelmed and not having the motivation to carry on with my day.  I find the racing thoughts to be coming back slightly and the symptoms coming back slightly vs. earlier in the week.

Saturday November 30th:

Took my pill around 9:00. I ended up doing ok symptom wise but less effective than earlier in the week.  I ended up going shopping with my wife and felt a crash coming around 2:00-2:30 where I tried to mitigate it with an afternoon cup of coffee.   I ended up lasting until 6:30-7:00 where I needed to retreat to my bedroom to take a nap because cognitively I couldn't function to help my wife with household chores.

Sunday December 1st:

I took my pill around 9:30-10.  I lasted until around 2:30 until I crashed again energy level wise where I was at the supermarket.  I ended up not being able to focus at all and was very overwhelmed with having to make decisions and communicating with my wife along with being around everyone.  I ended up retreating to the bedroom for about 45 minutes where I didn't nap, but just put myself in a place to rest for a little while while I hyperfocused on something on my phone.  After that time, my energy levels were ok, but I didn't have the symptom management I had earlier in treatment.

Monday December 2nd:

I haven't been able to focus so far in the morning and I have taken my pill around 9:15.  I ended up writing this journal for the rest of the days as recording symptom tracking and a way to understand what is going on titration and treatment wise.  My energy levels haven't risen for the day.

I’m assuming it was an empty threat, but I felt really intimidated.

Am I the one in the wrong for not helping?

* **RDW** = SPACE STOCK GANG. These legends are building the goddamn space highways for satellites, lunar shit holes, and Elon’s Mars brothel dreamland.
* Stock’s been up **381% YTD**, but it’s still trading under $15. That’s clown-shoe cheap.
* Backlog: $2.9 BILLION (yes, billion with a ""B""). That’s like Bezos buying RDW’s entire business just to wipe his bald-ass head.
* **Catalysts**: NASA money taps, defense contracts, and Ark Invest might just YOLO in.
* TL;DR: RDW is ready to moon harder than the first fucking Apollo mission.

# 🚨 Why RDW is a Fucking Buy RIGHT NOW 🚨

1. **SPACE IS SEXY AND RDW OWNS IT**
   * The space sector is gonna be worth **$1 TRILLION by 2040**. You know what that means? RDW is sitting at the kids' table right now, but soon it's gonna grab the whole goddamn turkey.
   * They’re not dicking around with basic satellites. They’re building the hardcore infrastructure for lunar habitats, satellite manufacturing, and f\*ing space factories. Yes, SPACE FACTORIES.
2. **NASA LOVES THROWING MONEY AT THESE GUYS**
   * Redwire’s been involved in the **Artemis mission** (aka ""Back to the Moon Bitches""). Every time NASA needs to spend some taxpayer cheddar, RDW’s name is on the shortlist.
   * Defense contracts? Hell yes. Redwire’s tech is gonna be on military satellites like gravy on Thanksgiving. If shit pops off in space, RDW is the one selling shovels.
3. **REVENUE GOING UP LIKE ELON’S FUCKING ROCKETS**
   * Q3 revenue hit **$76.9M**, up **44% YoY**. Their backlog is $2.9 BILLION. That’s 10x their goddamn market cap. Imagine your broke ass having $100k lined up while owing $10k on your credit card. Yeah, that’s RDW.
   * If they convert even half that backlog into revenue, we’re talking about sending bears to the unemployment line.
4. **ARK INVEST COULD FOMO HARD**
   * Cathie ""Tendie Queen"" Wood’s **ARKX Space ETF** might just wake up and add RDW. When that happens, you’ll see retail degenerates pouring in faster than a Black Friday mob at Walmart.
5. **CHEAP AF**
   * RDW trades at **0.5x sales**. Meanwhile, other space stocks like Rocket Lab (RKLB) are at 10x sales. RDW is a f\*\*\*ing bargain bin moonshot waiting to happen.

# 🚀 The Catalysts 🚀

1. **NASA Contracts**: These government nerds love handing out cash like it’s Monopoly money. Every new project means more green for RDW.
2. **Earnings Growth**: Next quarter’s results could be a blowout, and you know what that means: 🚀🚀.
3. **Space Hype**: Every time Elon tweets ""Mars,"" every boomer and millennial piles into space stocks. RDW is gonna ride that hype train all the way to fucking orbit.

# 🤬 Risks (skip this shit)

* **Volatility**: This stock trades like a goddamn rollercoaster. Don’t cry if it drops 10% in an afternoon because someone spilled coffee in mission control.
* **Debt**: RDW’s got some debt (\~$300M). But fuck it, so does half of America. They’ll pay it off when the tendies start printing.
* **Space Race Competition**: Space is heating up, but RDW’s got its niche locked down. No one else is doing what these legends are doing.

# My Degenerate Game Plan

* **Buy the Dips**: If this thing dips below $13, you slap that Buy button so hard it calls you Daddy.
* **Options Gang**: Look at $15 or $20 calls expiring in March or June 2025. High IV, but if it moons, you’re gonna be stacking tendies faster than Bezos stacks yachts.
* **Long Hold**: This isn’t a week-long YOLO. Hold this baby for 1-2 years, and you’ll be wiping your tears with Benjamins.

# Price Targets

* **Short Term (6 months)**: $20-$25 if space hype holds.
* **Long Term (2025+)**: $50+.

# Final Thoughts (Buy the fucking stock)

If you’re not in RDW yet, WTF are you doing? Do you just sit by and watch your mother get pounded by your bully? You probably do. They’re building the future of space while trading at meme stock prices. This is a fucking layup. The only thing riskier than buying RDW is NOT buying RDW.

🚀 **RDW to the moon, Mars, and fucking beyond** 🚀

**Not financial advice. If you lose money, it’s on you**

for context I had a very beginner espresso set up for a few years with the breville bambino and a capresso grinder. I recently got married and as a gift my uncle gave me a marzocco micra. I quickly realized that the capresso grinder I had is not good enough for this machine and bought a timemore c3 hand grinder to be able to use it while I find the right home espresso grinder. 

After a fair bit of research I am looking for a hopper style, grind by weight grinder. There is a coffee roaster not far from me that I love their beans and plan to have this grinder be dedicated to their bean while using the timemore hand grinder for dialing in one off bags I want to try. I also tend to have a few guests over every once in a while and would like a grinder that allows me to pump out shots as if I were a cafe. 

A few options I like are the:
Fiorenzato allground sense
Eureka Atom x75
Slightly out of budget the acaia orbit
On the cheaper side Mahlkonig x54

Any guidance here on other recs or if I should pull the trigger on any of the options above would be super helpful!

I picked up my Highland Model 3 Long Range exactly a month ago.  On the drive home, I noticed a slight vibration or shimmy in the steering wheel above 75 mph.  I figured a tire might need breaking in, so I gave it a few weeks.  It did not improve.  Pressures were correct.

So I used the app to make an appointment at the Gilroy, California Service Center, which is attached to a dealer showroom.  Estimate was $0, anticipated work was ""check tire pressures"" (which were, again, correct).  Slick, automated process.

The advisor, Brandon, and I took it for a test drive, and he noticed the slight vibration too.  ""We'll check it out,"" he assured me.  Cool detail: the car automatically went into service mode on arrival at the service center, and my spare key was not needed.  Tesla has attacked all the pinch points in the service experience!

And so I retired to the waiting room, which was comfortable and with decent coffee and tea and some interesting Tesla videos playing in a loop on a big screen.  The Tesla app, unbidden, offered me $100 in Uber ride credits for the day, but I had reading with me and was happy to wait.

About 90 minutes later, Brandon came to find me.  And then came the amazing part: ""We balanced the tires, but when we road tested it the problem was still there.  We force-balanced them, but that didn't fix the problem either.  So we are replacing all the tires.""

This was welcome and in an ideal world should have not been surprising, but over the years I've had many runarounds with other marques' dealers, especially when it comes to tires.  Most often there's a finger-pointing game where the car manufacturer blames the tire manufacturer and vice versa.

None of that.  The crew was truly committed to fixing this issue and seeing me drive away happy.  Big thanks to Brandon and tech Jose for taking such good care of me.",2,1733169100.0,TeslaLounge,2,1.0,False

I gained 50lbs at 24-25 and I’m 31 now. Everything seems like it’s coming together but now I realized I shouldn’t have quit the plan. It was just so damn hard.

The plan was:

No butter, salt, sugar, gluten (she didn’t even trust gluten free) no rice of any kind, no condiments, no coffee, juice unless juicer. No beef (I’m allergic to beef, spelt, dairy of all kinds, citric acid, dyes, goats lol), no seeds or nuts or lentils, no canned anything, no fish (due to high toxicity)

Eggs
Water + frozen berries organic + sun warrior protein powder (although I am learning about lead in a lot of these)
Steamed veggies only (can’t break down raw)
Berries only (anything with “berry”)
Chicken bone broth
Green tea (big coffee drinker)

… and that’s it. I lost my damn mind. I was hungry but eventually everything got old and I just starved a lot. However, in 3 months, I lost 15lbs and I couldn’t afford a stool test and left.

# What is a Funnel Cake?

# History and Origin

Funnel cakes date back to medieval times but gained popularity in the U.S. through Pennsylvania Dutch communities. Originally made during special occasions, this treat is now a staple at fairs and festivals.

# Why Are They So Popular?

The combination of crispy, golden edges and a soft, doughy center, topped with powdered sugar, makes funnel cakes a beloved indulgence.

# Ingredients You’ll Need

# Basic Ingredients:

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 2 large eggs
* 1 ½ cups milk
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

# Optional Toppings:

* Powdered sugar
* Whipped cream
* Fresh berries
* Chocolate syrup

# Essential Kitchen Tools

# For Preparation:

* Mixing bowls
* Whisk or hand mixer

# For Frying:

* Deep frying pan or skillet
* Funnel or piping bag
* Thermometer
* Tongs

# Step-by-Step Funnel Cake Recipe

# 1. Mixing the Batter

Start by whisking together the eggs, milk, sugar, and vanilla extract. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture until smooth.

# 2. Preparing the Oil

Heat about 2 inches of oil in a deep skillet to 375°F (190°C). Use a thermometer to maintain the correct temperature.

# 3. Frying the Funnel Cake

Pour the batter into a funnel or piping bag. Swirl the batter into the hot oil in a circular motion. Fry until golden brown, flipping once. Remove and drain on paper towels.

# Tips for Perfect Funnel Cakes

# Batter Consistency

Your batter should be smooth but not too runny. Think pancake batter!

# Frying Tips

Maintain a consistent oil temperature. Too hot, and the cake burns; too cool, and it gets soggy.

# Creative Toppings Ideas

# Traditional Toppings

* Classic powdered sugar is always a winner.

# Unique Twists

* Try drizzling Nutella or adding crushed cookies for an extra indulgence.

# Healthier Alternatives

# Baked Funnel Cakes

Skip the frying and bake your funnel cake in a preheated oven at 375°F for about 20 minutes.

# Gluten-Free and Vegan Options

Use gluten-free flour and plant-based milk for dietary preferences.

# How to Serve Funnel Cakes

Plate your funnel cake on a decorative dish, dust with powdered sugar, and serve with a side of whipped cream or fruit for a gourmet touch.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

# Overmixing the Batter

Overmixing can lead to dense cakes. Mix just until combined.

# Incorrect Frying Temperature

Too low, and the cake absorbs oil; too high, and it burns. Keep that thermometer handy!

# Storing and Reheating Funnel Cakes

Store leftover funnel cakes in an airtight container at room temperature. To reheat, place them in an oven at 350°F for a few minutes to regain crispiness.

# Pairing Suggestions

Pair your funnel cake with a cold lemonade or hot coffee. For a more indulgent experience, try it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

# Conclusion

There you have it — a simple, foolproof funnel cake recipe that brings the carnival to your kitchen. Try it out, experiment with toppings, and enjoy a delicious treat anytime you crave a little indulgence.

# FAQs About Funnel Cakes

# 1. Can I make funnel cakes ahead of time?

Yes! Prepare the batter in advance and store it in the fridge for up to 24 hours.

# 2. What oil is best for frying funnel cakes?

Vegetable oil or canola oil works best because of their high smoke points.

# 3. Can I freeze funnel cakes?

Yes, you can freeze them. Reheat in the oven for the best results.

# 4. How do I avoid soggy funnel cakes?

Ensure your oil is at the correct temperature and drain the cakes well after frying.

# 5. Can I use pancake mix to make funnel cakes?

5. Can I use pancake mix to make funnel cakes?

Absolutely! Pancake mix is a quick alternative if you’re short on time.",1,1733168681.0,LailaRecipes,0,1.0,False

They are typically served on sticks, making them both portable and mess-free. Popularized by their whimsical appearance and bite-sized charm, cake pops are a hit at birthday parties, weddings, and holiday gatherings.

His sheets felt so soft and comfy… He really didn’t want to leave them, but he knew his mom would give him an earful if he wasn’t out of bed before nine A.M.

He clutched the edge of his pillow and… felt something he wasn’t expecting. Something light and metallic. The young boy froze. He knew exactly what this was.

https://preview.redd.it/csibm3s8nh4e1.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2da94d07d5decfcfdb5af11c59d5dd85b0d1d0d0

*Oh gods… No, no, you can’t have an Osairem. You* ***know*** *what mom said. Leave it there, burn it- Nah, that won’t work…*

Osairem cards were notoriously difficult to destroy. In fact, no one had managed to figure out what *could* destroy them. But there had to be something he could do to get out of this… *Hey… maybe it’s not an Osairem card…? Maybe it’s a Battle Card or something. Only one way to know…*

Slowly, he pulled the card out of his pillow case. Looking at it, it had the image of a small, shark-like lizard on it, in the middle of a desert. In the top right corner lay a rock symbol inside a circle, and on the left, the numeral II. Along the side of the card, there were 7 words, each with a letter next to them.

*Vitality: C+, Strength: C, Defense: D+, M. Strength: D-, M. Defense: D, Agility: B-, Dexterity: B-, Luck: D+*

The young boy’s eyes squeezed shut. *It’s an Osairem… Gods damn it…*

https://preview.redd.it/dk76nddcnh4e1.jpg?width=474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d0eb21ace7f36826025033ac8aa912a4309c69e

The card started glowing. Jake started shaking his head widely.

“No, no no no no-”

A small, scaly, three fingered claw came out of the portrait. A second one came out, and the Osairem pulled himself out.

https://preview.redd.it/5e7l7htenh4e1.jpg?width=1025&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85c1528ef194771d16671d9a44b91797a6d1f9f4

  


The two just stood there, sitting on the bed, staring at each other for a bit. “Geeze,” the Osairem finally said. “You just not much of a talker, or you’ve never seen an Osairem before?”

Jake jumped back. “Wait, HOW ARE YOU TALKING?”

The Osairem paused for a moment, before shaking his head widely. “I’m sorry, *did you just understand me?”*

Jake took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down. He really didn’t want his mom to find out about this…

“Uh, yeah. H-how, what-”

The Osairem threw his claws back. “Holy mother of- I’m just as confused as you but FINALLY a human who understands me! Mind telling me your name?”

Needless to say, Jake was still… A little bewildered. He’d seen Osairem around before, but none of them had talked before. It took him a few moments to respond.

“...Jake. Jake’s my name.”

The Osairem nodded. “Mine’s Jupua!”

“Well hey there Jupua! So uh if you don’t mind me asking, how did you learn the um… Talking thing?”

Jupua scratched his head as his eyes tilted up. “...To be honest, I don’t remember. Come to think of it, I don’t remember much of anything ‘cept my name…”

Jake tilted his head. “Really-”

“JAKE!” His mom's voice thundered from downstairs. “Why aren't you out of bed yet?”

Jake groaned. “I’m so sorry Jupua I’ve gotta go.”

The Osairem climbed onto his lap. “What, and you’re not taking me? You summoned me, which means you’re my Tamer. In other words, you’re stuck with me, pal.”

Jake stared at his new Osairem for a bit, before finally swallowing and speaking. “Just be warned… She might not take this well.”



“YOU WHAT?”

Jake flinched as his mom yelled. They were standing in the middle of the living room, the flower print rug over the hardwood floor. At the back, one fluffy couch sat in front of the TV that seemed like it was meant for three, and in front of it, a glass coffee table. At the right side of the room was another similar couch with a lamp beside it.

“I-I just, the card just appeared in my pillowcase and I-I’m sorry-”

His mother closed her eyes and inhaled, looking like she was counting to ten. “What. Did I tell you? Osairem are *dangerous.* I kept you away from them for a reason, and now you go out and SUMMON ONE?”

“He just appeared in my pillowcase! Go on Jupua, tell her!”

Jupua nodded. “Yeah! It wasn’t his fault! I don’t know how I got there either!”

The mother’s face scrunched up. “Great, first you disobey me, now you’re getting delusional.”

Jake tilted his head. “Wait, you can’t… Understand him?”

“Of course I can’t, Osairem don’t speak,” she sighed, pinching her eyes. “It can’t be helped. You got an Osairem, you’re a Tamer now. …Do the dishes. *All of them,* and then you can go get registered. But you’ll have to find your own way there.”

Without further words, she went back to her room.

“Damn… Your mom’s kinda a dick, huh?” Jupua folded his arms.

“Tell me about it.” Jake grumbled.

The kitchen in Jake’s house was decently big, and about what you’d expect a kitchen to look like. White tiled floor, black counters, white cabinets underneath and above those counters, and an “island” counter of sorts in the middle. But what caught Jake’s eye was the mountains upon mountains of dishes, all across the left *and* right counters. *Of course mom didn’t do any of these herself…*

[“Ugh… These are gonna take forever to clean up…”](https://preview.redd.it/1zqbb9oinh4e1.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85c722abe1ac98a79776f25b3d87f02cbbf1c7e8)

Jupua looked at the dishes, then up at his Tamer and gave him a toothy frown. “...Lemme help.”

Jake laughed a little. “That’d be very much appreciated!”

Jupua grinned, and beat his chest once. “Leave it to me!”

The Osairem jumped onto the left counter, and just barely didn’t make it, having to hold on to the counterside and scamper up with his claws. Facing the dishes, he started hacking. His Tamer’s eyes widened with horror upon realizing what he was about to do.

“WAIT WAIT WAIT DON’T-”

And then, Jupua barfed up a wave of sand all over the dishes. Miraculously, the sand washed over and cleansed all of the dishes, dissipating after it did its job. Jake blinked twice.

“How did you…?”

His Osairem turned to him and grinned.

[“How do you think I bathe? Licking myself clean?”](https://preview.redd.it/cd8qyvolnh4e1.jpg?width=1400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0e75ecb2a3b919c16439594d2ca1354411fe994)

1h53oei,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1h53oei/lied_about_my_age_may_of_been_groomed/,"Lied about my age, may of been groomed ","


When I was 15, I lied about my age to get a piercing. I said I was 19. The piercer (28), asked for my number, then text me a week or so after asking if I’d be up for modelling for a reference picture for an art piece. I can’t remember if we were talking much before, but I did end up going round to his house, I remember feeling so nervous. I can’t remember how long it was before we were having sex. I thought at the time it was my first consensual sexual relationship, even though I was 15 and they were 28, I felt like I wanted it and I had lied about my age so I thought he wasn’t guilty like the past men in my life.. I would walk from school to his house, missing lessons sometimes, then going back to school after too (didn’t have a uniform). We would go to the pub together and drink, and I would stay the night at his (lying to my mum about where I was staying). 

I know there’s a chance that he knew I was underage anyway, and even if he did think I was 19 the age gap does feel pretty doggy. And reflecting on how he approached me ect, I know how it looks. It’s like the facts are in front of me but emotionally, I’m still holding on to this idea of him I’ve been obsessing about for the last almost 10 years.

Anyway, I’m 24 now, I bumped into him the other day, he’s about 37 and he asked if we can meet up for a coffee and chat. I don’t know if he means to take accountability, cover his tracks, or hit on me again. We ended on good terms as I ended up in a monogamous relationship with my ex/ abuser for 4 years after that (he knew I was 15). He just wished me well, as he never wanted a friendship/non sexual relationship with me anyway. 

I still have an overwhelming urge to impress him, and part of me is longing to reenact the relationship we had. I want the validation so badly it’s like that part of me hasn’t even aged. I feel so mentally stuck there. 

Very recently was the first time someone close to me used the word “groomed” when talking about this situation and it’s really stuck with me. I asked an AI about this situation and got such honest brutal answers I cried. I’ve been reading about grooming and it’s just been adding up so much in my head. It’s crazy, it’s not like I didn’t know what grooming was before, but I just didn’t want to admit a lot to myself I guess. It happened to me so many times before and after this.

I’ve been feeling,at times overwhelmingly, guilty, having continued to lie about my age to have sex with him. I completely blamed myself, I’ve punished myself over it, over the past almost 10 years. I still feel terrible that I know this horrible secret about someone that they may not even know themselves. 

We’re in so many of the same circles (I’ve been hibernating for years is the only reason I haven’t bumped into him more), and I’ve been obsessing over this for so long, I think I’m going to meet up with him and talk about it. I’m so torn between wanting to apologise and submit to him, and part of me wants to ask him, what the fuck?

If people have advice, or can relate, I’d appreciate, but also think it’s time I finally talked about it, not in secret, even if no one responds.",2,1733168416.0,CPTSD,4,1.0,False

Currently enjoying a proper cup from Coffee Movement, not sure of the neighborhood but it’s the one near the Golden Gate Bridge and park. 

Instantly realized this shop takes things a little more seriously by the:
- melo dripper used.
- Dedicated pour over island separated from espresso dead center of shop
- Weber workshop shaker for espresso distribution.

I got the double washed Columbia gesha from Jose Geraldo, roasted by A.M.O.C, and my god the flavor is divine. I was an idiot and I thought it was $6, but it rang up to $10: found out that coffee starts at $4, and pour overs or certain coffee gets upcharged. However the generous pour makes up for it imo. 

I’ve been recently pretty offput by pricy ‘gesha’ pours at shops that equate to a mellowed out yirgacheffe nowadays, but this one was done better than what I could at home.

Smell right off pour reminded me of sweet dark chocolate, orange peel, with an undertone of floral scent. I couldn’t stop taking deep inhales of the cup, keep picking up strong orange chocolate scent that was intoxicating.

Taste off pour at hot was still very notable with an orange tea punch, with long lasting floral ride that continues with each sip.

Little sourness from the citrus orange becomes more prominent once the cup cools, but I’m still really enjoying it.

Amazing coffee, sad that the roaster is in Rotterdam, glad I got a bag of dak to try at home.

Love camping but tired of roughing it? You don’t have to sacrifice style and comfort to enjoy the great outdoors! Here are some easy and affordable tricks to turn your next camping trip into a glamping getaway:

1️⃣ Upgrade Your Tent Game
Ditch the basic tent and go for something spacious with tall ceilings. Add fairy lights or a hanging lantern for cozy vibes, and lay down a colorful outdoor rug for that “home away from home” feel.

2️⃣ Sleeping Like Royalty
Forget sleeping bags! Bring an air mattress or a foldable cot, topped with plush bedding, fluffy pillows, and a soft throw blanket. Bonus: Add a hot water bottle for chilly nights!

3️⃣ Dine in Style
Pack a foldable table, real dinnerware (yes, ditch the paper plates), and a tablecloth. Serve up gourmet campfire meals like grilled salmon, skewers, or a charcuterie board. Don’t forget a bottle of wine! 🍷

4️⃣ Set the Mood with Lighting
String solar-powered fairy lights around your tent or campsite. Lanterns and LED candles can also add a warm glow without the fire hazard.

5️⃣ Bring the Spa to the Outdoors
Portable showers and soft towels are a game changer. Add a few drops of essential oils like lavender to your towels for an extra luxe touch.

6️⃣ Create an Outdoor Lounge
Set up comfy chairs with cushions, a fire pit, and a small coffee table. Bring a Bluetooth speaker for background music and a good book for ultimate relaxation.

7️⃣ Gourmet S’mores Bar
Take the classic campfire treat to the next level with flavored marshmallows, gourmet chocolate, and fancy crackers (think graham crackers meet shortbread).

Camping doesn’t have to mean sacrificing comfort! With these small upgrades, you’ll transform your trip into an outdoor adventure with a touch of elegance.

1h53k2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h53k2v/i_heard_the_horn_of_hedge_lake/,I heard the Horn of Hedge Lake,"My three best friends have been killed.

Alexander, Luke, Emily and I went on a camping trip two weeks ago. Alex knew this spot out at Hedge Lake, a few hours from the apartment the three of them share. I didn’t have much in terms of camping supplies, but Alex and Luke said they had us covered. We packed the gear into Luke’s truck and headed out.

I was so excited. And now they’re gone.

The drive to Hedge Lake wasn’t bad- and the only sign that things would get worse is only really understandable after the fact.

We started realizing all the little things we left or forgot- roasting sticks, coffee filters, sunblock, and we were a bit bummed. As we were going up the little mountain road, winding back and forth nauseatingly, we saw a building appear through the trees. It was one of those almost abandoned gas stations, a flickering red open sign on the door, a single pump and an owner you have to assume carries at least three guns at all times. There weren’t any towns marked closer to Hedge Lake, so we stopped to see if we could get what we needed.

A rusty bell dinged as we entered from the cracked and faded parking lot, and Luke made a face of surprise as the door actually opened.

“Damn, who runs this place?” he muttered.

The teller wasn’t visible, but I could hear the sound of pen scratching against paper from a small office behind the smokes.

We found the supplies we needed, and after a small fight between Alex and Luke on the ideal chip shape, managed to get to the counter in one piece. The teller was still writing in the office. Luke unceremoniously tapped the service bell, and the writing immediately stopped. A chair was shoved back roughly, and very quickly we got a look at the type of person who would own a place like this.

Stringy and weathered, an old man with a scowl so developed that it directed the flow of all the wrinkles on his aged face appeared.

He fidgeted with his pen as he approached the counter, and in silence began to ring up our items.

“How much for the stick lighters?” Luke asked.

The man stared at him in shock, cataracts covering pale eyes and a wide, dumbfounded expression on his face. His jaw snapped shut and posture straightened rigidly, like a tethered puppet held by invisible strings.

“13.50,” a whispered voice croaked from the man.

“The green one, please.”

“Have you heard the Horn?”

“What?”

The clerk extended our receipt in a clammy hand.

“No need to listen for it,” he said with a perverse smile. “The Horn sounds through your bones and your flesh, a silent cacophony of yourself.”

“Let’s get the fuck out, babe” Emily said, pulling Luke from the counter. Alex reached for the receipt, but the clerk kept it gripped in his hand, and the paper was torn in two.

“It calls and calls, but you should not answer. The Horn must be the only song. The only song. The only song worth sing-”

We hurried out of there, convinced of his drug problems and insanity, not giving his words any credit. After these events, I tried to locate him to see what he knows, but I can’t. I’ve driven that road several times in the last week, and searched on satellite, and there is no evidence of there ever being a gas station out there.

The campsite was empty- not abandoned, Alex ensured, but it only had five firepits, and the actual Hedge Lake was an hour hike out from the site. On our first night we set up the tent and investigated around our camp. Nobody else was there, and it was relatively simple. We reached the trailhead to Hedge Lake that we were supposed to take the next day, but went no further. Emily found a few chanterelles, which we sauteed and served on top of the cheeseburgers Luke grilled.

The sounds of the forest really came alive after dark, and we realized just how far out we were. There was nothing but wilderness for miles around.

“This is all mostly BLM property,” Alex explained. “Not sure what they use it for, but it’s protected.”

“Probably some animal reservation, there’s a lot of land set up just to keep the ecosystem normal.” Luke had a smear of marshmallow he was cleaning off of his finger as he said this.

“Usually they say what the land’s for at campsites, though,” Emily said, stoking the fire.

“Yeah, there aren’t many markers at all around here,” I noted. “Let’s make sure not to get lost.”

“I got you guys covered,” Luke said, reaching into his backpack and pulling out a -frankly huge- satellite phone. “Just stay with me, and we can go anywhere. This thing’s got GPS, can call across the world, all kinds of survival shit. I’ve got a solar charger, too!”

“Great, so we’re stuck with you,” I teased.

Luke flipped me off, and I smiled mockingly.

Like the hand of death, a jolting, negative pain erupted from my spine. My back screamed in agony and I dropped my hot tea into my lap, burning myself. I fell off my chair, and couldn’t see for several seconds. A low-pitched, drowning hum and a piercing ring clouded my ears. For those brief few moments I was locked in a blind, senseless, painful prison. I came to with Alex checking on me, and though I was shocked and confused, the pain left after a moment, and everything returned to normal. Except for my tea-burned legs, I was unharmed.

Maybe I’d gone overboard lifting the ice chest, or tweaked my back somehow during the day, but the sudden pain and the damn *ringing* drove me insane. 

Emily was the next to feel it- doubling over in pain as she got a drink from the cooler. She described the same pain I had felt, the same resounding sound that had disturbed me. Only then did we revisit the clerk’s words. 

I was convinced we had heard the Horn he had mentioned. Easy to say, I’m the most superstitious of my friends. Some tweaked out old man rambling about a Horn is one thing- but as soon as I experience that thing? I was ready to pack up that night and drive home. 

I was outvoted, even by Emily, who conceded that it was weird, but was more worried about if the mushrooms she had picked were *actually* chanterelles.

Luke didn’t hear it until we had all gone to bed- shooting straight up in his sleeping bag and shouting out in pain, waking all of us. He said that he had seen something in his dream- before the pain. I took a voice recording on my phone, and I’ve transcribed that here:

“I was here- in the forest. Running fast- running toward something. I remember being drawn towards it, pulled faster than my legs could keep up but I kept running.”

“Did you get there?”

“No. She stopped me.”

*Luke was shaking, rough hands trembling like he was severely dehydrated.*

“Who stopped you?”

“I don’t know- a woman. I was running, and she jumped out in front of me. I think I ran into her. 

Then I woke up and… and I felt it.”

“The Horn.”

*Luke nodded. Alex rolled his eyes.*

“Oh my god, Willow, it’s not a fucking ghost.”

“No, but it’s *something,* Alex! Don’t be dense.”

*Alex shook his head and began to leave.*

“What are you doing? Don’t-don’t go outside!”

Alex left the tent, while Emily, Luke and I commiserated. He came back about fifteen minutes later, sliding into his sleeping bag quietly. When I asked him what he’d been doing, he whispered that he had forced himself to throw up the mushrooms, but didn’t want Emily to feel bad. He had an odd look in his eyes, but I didn’t press him about it. 

We all managed to fall back asleep after a time, but I woke up to hear Emily calling out for Luke, and Alex groggily joining her search. At first we reasoned that he had walked out of sight for an early-morning piss, but when he didn’t come back by the time Alex had a fire going, we got concerned. 

We searched around the campsite, and Emily found some footprints in the muddy camp road nearby. They weren’t from Luke’s boots though, which were missing from the front of our tent. They were bare, human feet that trailed out from the woods and stopped about twenty feet from our campsite. The last set of tracks were pointed directly at our tent, and there was no trail leading away from our site.

I started freaking out, certain that someone or something had come and taken Luke. I think I made Emily even more worried, because she rapidly began throwing things into her backpack.

“Where are you going?” Alex asked her.

“Into the woods- where the footprints came from.” Emily wasn’t giving herself time to feel anything, only focusing on action.

“He could be anywhere, Em. The best plan is to stay here and wait for him to come back. He has the sat phone, right?”

Emily’s face grew paler, and she shot a nervous glance at Luke’s backpack, which still rested inside our tent.

After a tense search, Emily revealed the large phone from his bag. That further convinced me that he had been taken. Luke was a level-headed guy. If he’d meant to go any significant distance from us, he would have both told someone and also taken that phone. 

Alex convinced Emily to not run off and search for him, and I hid my desire to get in his truck and drive off right then and there. I feel guilty about abandoning him so quickly, but honestly, that might have been the right call.

As the sun began to set that night, and Luke still hadn’t returned, a new level of fear kicked in. Every passing moment was a torment of unknowing, and Emily and I had dried up our tear ducts hours ago. We sat in painful silence near an absent fire as Alex paced anxiously near the truck.

“Hello!?” a distant voice called out. It came from the west- towards the trail to Hedge Lake.

“Luke?” Emily cried out.

“Guys? … Hellooo?” The voice echoed in the woods, and we all rushed in its direction.

Emily had placed the sat phone in her bag, which she left by her chair as she ran towards the voice. I had a sixth sense that we were running into trouble, like a bead of sweat down my spine, and grabbed the bag as I ran after her.

“Luke, we’re coming!” Emily called as she reached the trailhead. “Where are you?”

We paused for a moment, waiting for a response.

“Hello!?” the voice called out again, further into the wooded trail. 

Emily, oblivious to my fear, clicked on her flashlight and entered the trail at a jog.

“Where the fuck is he,” Alex muttered as he turned on the flashlight of his iphone.

Emily did cross-country, and was used to running on shitty trails, but Alex and I had trouble keeping up with her, with only his short phone light to guide our ever-darker steps. She kept calling out to him, and he kept answering, but the voice only grew slightly closer. Then, maybe ten minutes after he first called out, Emily stopped dead in her tracks. As Alex and I caught up, she stood perfectly still with her back to us. The shadows from her flashlight shook from the soft trembling of her hand.

“Luke?” Alex called out, waiting for the response. None came.

I walked up to Emily and placed my hand on her shoulder. She didn’t react.

“You alright, Em?” I asked.

Her lip quivered, and her cold teary eyes turned to look at me without shifting her head.

“I hear him,” she whispered. Tears slid down her cheek. “He’s in pain. He needs help.”

Before I could question her on this, a scream pierced the damp forest air around us. It was incredibly close, and though I couldn’t place a direction on it, Emily snapped her neck to the left and darted off the trail into the woods. She moved so quickly that I couldn’t grab her, only cry out as her light danced into the trees. Alex and I stood for a moment, uncertain. 

He shot me a wary glance and asked; “We have to go, right?”

I swallowed in my dry throat, guilty and afraid of my answer. “We don’t have to. But I can’t leave her here. I’m going. You got the car keys?”

“Yep. You got the phone?”

“Yeah.” I took a deep breath. “Fuck it,” I said, and moved into the woods after Emily.

The screaming continued intermittently for several minutes; wordless, excruciating pain. As I write this, I cannot say with any confidence that it was even Luke’s voice crying out. I hadn’t heard anyone scream like this before, and I don’t dare to imagine what would be done to prompt those noises from someone. 

As we trudged through the woods, the ringing of the Horn returned. I don’t know if Alex heard it, because both of us were too serious about chasing down Emily to mention it. The low bass and high ring permeated the trees around us, as if the woods were singing to us. 

The cries went silent, and Alex and I closed in on the shaky, dim light that was our only sign of where Emily was. 

She had fallen to her knees on some branches, the flashlight shining an eerie spotlight into the darkness. It had fallen beside her, and her fingers dug into the forest floor. 

She was crying, but silently, and without convulsing. Just silent tears down her face, as she stared into the woods with glazed eyes. We could hear her mumbling to herself as we approached.

“He’s not gone, he’s not gone, he’s not gone,” she repeated. “I can hear him singing. He’s calling for me. He’s not gone- he’s singing to me. He’s not gone, he’s not!”

“Emily, we have to get back to the trail,” I said. “He can follow our voices, we shouldn’t get lost trying to find him.”

She shook her head. “That’s not where he is! I know where he is! I just… I need to hear him again.”

I heard the crack of a branch, and looked up just in time to see something move out of Emily’s light into the darkness. I couldn’t make out the shape, only a dark, hairlike blur as it rustled away into the night.

“What the fuck was that?” Alex whispered. He looked terrified, shining his light towards the movement. From his pants Alex procured a full tang knife, which was more of a safety blanket than any real protection. 

The Horn rang out- louder this time, and I doubled over in pain. My spine felt like it was being welded together, and my arm flung itself out like a punch against my will. It felt like a sick puppet master was lacing hooks into my flesh and attempting to pull my body around. When I regained my eyesight and my composure, the bleary chaos I saw was hard to comprehend.

Emily must have lunged for the woods again, but Alex had caught her. I saw her latch onto his torso like a constrictor, and I think she bit him because he cried out in pain. Still, he didn’t release her, and wrestled her down to the forest floor. I stumbled back to my feet and tried to head towards them, to help Alex calm her down, but my body froze as I locked eyes with another observer of their fight. 

A woman, old, with leathery, weathered brown skin stood in the ferns illuminated by Emily’s fallen flashlight. She was naked, with mad black hair that cascaded from her shoulders like a gross bird’s nest. Her black, soulless eyes stared at me, and her cracked lips formed a smile which made my insides writhe in fear.

The Horn was still singing, though the pain had receded slightly. Alex had gotten control of Emily’s limbs and was holding her to the ground, keeping his attention focused on Emily, who continued to thrash and bite at him. 

The woman opened her mouth, and began to sing a warm, harmonious note. It blended with the Horn’s dissonance, finding a middle ground between the low and high extremes of it. It formed a weirdly pleasant chord, but the strength of the woman’s voice made my heart tremble. There was a venomous feeling behind the song, a hidden threat in the composition of the chord.

The singing startled Alex, even more so when Emily joined in, singing the same note as the woman. She slashed at Alex’s face, and his grip loosened. Emily sprung from his grasp like an untethered beast, leaping into the woods singing her song.

Alex turned to look at me, still immobile with fear. He ran at me, wrapping me up in his arms and pulling me back the way we had come. 

“You have to run, Willow!” he screamed at me. My brain finally turned back on, and I clumsily grabbed Emily’s flashlight and followed him.

Behind us, the woman and her song followed. I heard her crash through the underbrush of the forest, an unimpeded hunter chasing after me. Terror filled my heart, and the ringing of the Horn formed a migraine in my head. Every leaping step I took sent reverberations of pain up my bones into my skull. Tears flowed from my cheeks from the pain, but I couldn’t stop. Alex struggled in front of me; the only light we had now was the flashlight in my hands, and he was maybe ten feet in the darkness ahead of me.

Alex’s foot caught on something, and he fell. I helped pull him up, and I took the lead with the light. It felt like we’d been running for hours. I don’t know how long it actually was, but I had the conscious understanding that we should’ve hit the trail again by now. Alex fumbled with something in his pocket- the car keys. He pulled them out, hitting the alarm button as many times in as many directions as he could. Wherever the truck was, the signal didn’t reach.

I felt the woman close in on me, a presence behind my back that I was too terrified to turn and see. Her song went uninterrupted by her run, as if she didn’t need to inhale to keep moving. Just a long, discordant note joining the Horn’s touch in my head.

The Horn was taking control of my legs. I could feel my muscles stiffen, resisting my movement as some alien influence tried to force me to stop. If you’ve ever run with a weight belt, the feeling was similar, except the weight was tied to my thighs and my ankles. Alex was faster than me, but he was matching my speed to stay by my side. Since I’ve known him, he’s always taken care of me, and I suppose this wasn’t any different. 

He shot a glance behind us and urged me forward anxiously. 

I don’t remember any other details of our run. So much of my awareness was focused on not giving in to the Horn that everything else was a blur. If we’d passed the trail in our frenzy, I was certainly not turning around.

In the end, I didn’t get a choice.

Something grabbed the backpack I still had slung around my shoulders and pulled me back with terrifying strength. The woman’s skeletal hand closed around my throat, and I began to black out.

The Horn was overwhelming now, my body convulsing and thrashing around- not against her grip but within it. I had no control over my motor function, and the small part of my mind that had not been closed away watched in terror.

I felt my lungs begin to swell, a breath of air summoned into my chest by my puppetmaster. I began to sing.

Alex plunged his knife into the naked woman’s throat. My weak eyes could barely make out his movements in the dark, but I know he saved my life. The woman’s song was cut short, and her control over my body stopped. Alex was hitting her, beating her face and back to a pulp. He got a good few licks in, until she grabbed his arm and snapped it like a branch. The ease and quickness of this action was horrifying, and I saw that same sickening smile on her face as blood poured from her neck.

I grasped around for any weapon I could find. Emily’s bag had been torn open by the woman’s grasp, and its contents were spilled around me.

My hand landed on a dense plastic rectangle. I grabbed it and scrambled forward towards the wrestling pair. The woman had dug fingers into Alex’s stomach, and he was screaming. I slammed my weapon into the side of the woman’s head with all the weight and force I could put behind it, and two things happened. I felt the woman’s skull crack under what I now realized was our satellite phone, and I heard the blaring alarm from it be triggered by the impact. 

It was one of those sirens designed to blast out miles, for Search and Rescue teams to find you. In close proximity, it was as loud as the Horn, though not as painful. As I pulled back for another strike, I saw the woman grab her ears and shriek in pain. She had hardly reacted to any of our blows, or the knife, but this sound seemed to break her. 

She kicked me in the chest and knocked the wind out of me. I didn’t have time to grab Alex. I just saw his look of terror as she grabbed him and ran back into the woods. Bless him, though, because he did one final thing that saved me before he was pulled into darkness.

With his right arm limp and broken at his side, he reached across his body with his left and pulled the car keys from his pocket.

“GO!” he cried, and he threw them towards me.

And the coward that I am, I did. I know it’s the guilt of that choice that’s driven me to where I am now, chasing ghost stories for closure. If anyone believed me, this would all be easier. But it’s like everyone would prefer to pretend like the woods around Hedge Lake don’t exist. Luke, Emily, and Alex are all considered missing persons, but no searches have been put out, and the police treat me as a suspect.

I don’t remember finding the trail, or our campsite again, or getting into Luke’s truck and driving away. I’ve somehow blacked out hours of driving, because when my memory returns again, I’m hours away on a highway nowhere near Hedge Lake. Of course, I reported them missing, but I still had Alex’s blood on my clothes. The police figured I’d done something to them, and at least Emily’s parents believe that story too. I’m not allowed to leave the state, and all of their investigation seems to be about me having a mental breakdown. I’ve been threatened with an asylum if I don’t “admit what I did”.

I’m tired of their accusations. I’m tired of nobody caring about what happened up there. I need answers. Please, if anyone knows about the Horn, Hedge Lake, or what that thing might have been… it would help me a lot. 

My life now is full of anxiety and repressed memories. If there’s a trial, the best I can hope for is to be called batshit insane. The worst.. I’m found guilty of killing my best friends. I know I didn’t, and I hope that the jury believes at least that. I can’t have the weight of what I didn’t do be added to what I did. 

The woman’s song has stayed with me, terrorizing my daily life. I hear the Horn in everything- cars on the street, the hum of a lamppost, even in the ocean. I’m afraid that one day I will truly hear it again, and the woman will come to finish what she started. 

Would that be so bad, to hear her song and be with my friends again? I’m not sure. I’d rather be dead and with them than locked up and alone. I’d rather be terrified and right than wrong and insane. When all you have is your friends, what do you do when they’re gone?

It went better than I expected. It was casual and chill, and the energy was the same as during our conversations, maybe even better. The first date ended with a hug when I walked her to the bus.

On the second date, she invited me to a bar. We sat, talked, and danced (and I’ve never danced in my life). She leaned in close to me and then invited me to her place, saying we could ""try"" it. I was quite shocked, but I was looking forward to it. However, I’m a virgin, so I thought it would be good for her to know. I told her.

She was even more shocked than I was before. ""Are you kidding?"" she said. I replied, ""No."" Then she said that she wouldn't enjoy it with a virgin and that I should have told her earlier. She grabbed her bag and left. I started crying and felt terrible. I thought about it all weekend.

I'm into Emmrich's and immediately noticed how you get a lot more content/cut scenes for his and it made me realize again how lacking Lucanis was for romance content specifically.

I mean, how wild could it get over $10,000 in marital assets? Turns out, very. I was not prepared for what went down.

First off, the lawyer on my partner’s ex’s side walks in. This guy is sharp. Expensive suit, shiny briefcase, looking like he gets paid just to stand there and intimidate people. I swear he oozed confidence—like he knows he’s already won and has a tee time in two hours. Then the other side’s “lawyer” shows up. Except, plot twist: it’s not a lawyer. It’s a law student. A 3L. You could practically hear the courtroom collectively go, “Uh-oh.”

This kid sits down, opens a binder the size of a phone book, and looks like he just crammed for this hearing five minutes before walking in. Meanwhile, Mr. Veteran Attorney pops a pill mid-sentence like it’s a Tic Tac, looking completely unbothered. I lean over to my partner and whisper, “Is this dude on Xanax?” My partner goes, “Probably. He’s been doing this forever. He could argue a case blindfolded.”

Anyway, the case starts. Big Shot Lawyer makes his argument, smooth as butter, doesn’t even need notes. Then it’s the kid’s turn. Oh boy. He opens his binder and starts reading—reading—from this 45-page monstrosity of a brief that has more block quotes than original thought. I’m sitting there like, Is this a legal hearing or story time? At one point, he said something about “binding presidents,” and I choked on my coffee trying not to laugh.

The judge, this grumpy-looking guy who clearly had better places to be, finally interrupts and goes, “Counselor, these cases don’t apply.” Now, any sane person would’ve said, “Oops, my bad,” and moved on. But not this kid. Oh no. He starts arguing with the judge. THE JUDGE. Like, “Actually, Your Honor…” Dude, you haven’t even passed the bar yet. Chill.

Meanwhile, Mr. Pills-and-Prestige is sitting there watching this kid self-destruct, looking like he’s counting down to his post-court margarita. At one point, I swear I saw him slide another pill under his tongue, like he needed an extra boost just to survive this train wreck.

The kid keeps digging his hole deeper, mumbling something about “core tenants” of the law (which, no, is not a thing) and trying to admit his brief as evidence. Even the judge looked like he wanted to crawl under his bench. Opposing counsel didn’t even bother objecting—he just sat back and let this kid crash and burn.

Finally, the judge cuts him off with a mercy ruling and says, “You’re free to appeal.” The kid looks so relieved, like he just got invited to the bar exam after-party, even though everyone else knows he’s not going to make it.

As we’re walking out, I look at my partner and go, “Honestly, you didn’t even need a lawyer. That guy’s brief alone probably tanked their case.” My partner nods and whispers, “Do you think that other attorney shares his pills?”

Moral of the story? Don’t send a 3L to do a grown lawyer’s job, especially if the opposing counsel comes armed with experience, sass, and a pocketful of pharmaceuticals.",0,1733167860.0,LawSchool,0,0.45,False

She's obviously had to buy plastic dressers to fit her clothes in there, because for some inane reason she won't put her clothes in the damn dressers already in the room!

[Why is your shit all in bins... are you his girlfriend or are you renting out a bedroom from him?](https://preview.redd.it/b0x04rqkjh4e1.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=7613e775a837421c6d713cac050d38a5cea9d2bc)

[What's the couch for Kailyn. Do you not sleep on JC's bed anymore?? Go home you idiot.](https://preview.redd.it/z7sdv6iyih4e1.png?width=1117&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0b30047b063abd69dcf980b48f6008cf6a7708b)

JC can't afford to rent or even buy a bigger place for them to live in, and all Kailyn is doing is packing it with shit she willingly left behind in Bowie, and is wasting money replacing it! There's no way that this guy would just let it slide like that! At the very *least* he has to be making some remarks about it, right? He'll bitch about her eating up ""his"" cottage cheese, but not about her buying an unnecessary pull out couch?

And if and when they break up, where will all that shit go anyway? Kailyn can't drive so she's not going to be U-hauling her ass back home with her junk.

Does anyone think she pays rent? Does even she pay bills? She seems to be the one paying for groceries yeah, but this bitch eats 5 eggs in one sitting! How many egg cartons does she have to buy each time, or is she ordering groceries like thrice a week??? And don't even get me started on the literal pounds of cheese they (mainly her) were eating in a single week, or how often they will eat out.

Her diet also mainly consists of pre-cooked frozen foods like 'grilled' chicken, chicken nuggets, cheese pizza, and of course bucket loads of ranch. Not only would it be cheaper to just buy the raw chicken, or the flour and cheese and prepping these things herself-- but it would save them a lot on electricity because the foods she eats practically keeps the air fryer running 24/7.

And BTW, Kailyn is a drain on the utilities and that's a fact. At home she'd keep her lights on ALL day despite it being like 1pm outside and she could very easily open up the curtains-- hell, she would have the curtains open and still have the lights on! She's got her electronics to charge, appliances like the air fryer and coffee maker, that she uses constantly. The like 3 fucking hair curlers she bought just this year as well... and don't forget that JC *needs* his fans to be running 24/7 as well.

That house is quite old. Like, can it even handle that much power being used? I've seen in some pictures that one of the outlets in the kitchen is scorched-- and JC has a freaking extension cord running from the kitchen to the bedroom too! That place is an electrical fire waiting to happen!

[That can't be good..](https://preview.redd.it/k0wc6ccqkh4e1.png?width=204&format=png&auto=webp&s=716e6258c5493e95a4156fc8353228583f29917e)

I really only eat a nutritiously poor dinner outside of an iced coffee here & then. Not big into sweets or snacking.

Anyways, I want to get into better shape (general health reasons) & have more confidence.

For context, I'm 20, and all of my teeth have a rough texture like this and brown spots. My lower front teeth are the only ones that don't have that. I have composite bonding on my upper front teeth because I  have big brown spots on my natural teeth. The back of my front teeth is basically how they would look in the front, but im too insecure to post a picture of that. 
I would say that I have good dental hygiene, I floss daily, brush twice with an electric toothbrush, I don't consume anything that could stain my teeth (coffee, smoking etc.), and I've never not had teeth like this. My brother (and maybe parents) has the same teeth situation as me (but his dental hygiene is not very good). 
I wish to know what is the cause of this? Did i not take care of my teeth well enough, or is it something else? What do you reccomend to get rid of this? Composite filling works for some time, but then again these spots show near the gaps of my teeth or near my gums, parts that the filling isnt covering. Is this just something that  I can't get rid of?

I just checked out of a hotel in Santa Cruz and it was super cheap and absolutely lovely and the couple at the front desk who ran the small 
hotel were absolutely lovely. 

I'm checking out this morning and there's a boomer guy at the front desk as I'm carrying my stuff out. Before I left I went to get a cup of coffee and there's this boomer guy that was there 20 minutes before I actually checked out and still there when I went to get coffee and he's not agitated or anything but he is talking this poor guy at the front desk's ears off about everything and absolutely nothing. Not complaining but nonstop talking in that way that older Boomer guys do because they just think the world wants to hear everything they have to say.


This poor front desk guy is trying to check people in and do his work with this boomer chattering without pause, just talking over everybody even as they're trying to talk through the check-in process. He starts talking about the movie Pulp Fiction and I see this as an opportunity to distract him and give the front desk some relief.  It's a really small room for the front desk and it's crowded even with four people standing in there.


I decide to engage with him directly while I'm getting my coffee and spoke with him at length so his focus would be on me at least while they were trying to complete the check in process. Even tried to use my body language and to talk about how beautiful it was outside to sort of lure him towards the exit opening and away from the front desk, and oh my God this guy is relentless. Absolutely no room for anyone else to speak ever. 


After the couple had checked in and the front desk guy had a few minutes to do paperwork or whatever, I finally gave up and had to move on and sadly the guy just stayed in there, moving onto stories about his travels and I just had to give the front desk guy a smile and a wink and mouthed ""good luck"" as I was leaving

I’ve worked at coffee shop, daycares (this was my favorite but I also need to be able to pay my bills), in the family carpentry business, at desk jobs for various companies and industries, and now I work remote for a green energy company. 

I have a bachelors degree in environmental/sustainability and I need to make around $75-80k/yr + insurance, my husbands job doesn’t offer it. I feel like my perfect job would be in the field or doing something out of the house for a few days a week and being able to be remote the other few days of the week.

I’m starting to feel like I am the issue at this point, but I’m truly feeling so unfulfilled. Every day is the same, and I didn’t expect to feel so isolated at a remote job. I am grateful though, I can’t really complain because you can’t beat the flexibility of a remote job but I am just not good at being sedentary at my house with no social interaction while my husband and baby are gone all day. I need to feel productive and staring at a screen all day are NOT doing it for me. 
I’d like to be a teacher, but being in a school in America is anxiety-inducing and I’ve heard the kids are a different breed now so I’m not sure I’d actually enjoy it. I think it would be nice to do like water or soil sampling or something like that because I could do the work, collect the samples, then go back and report in with the data etc. Land Surveying?

Today, I made a coffee around 16:00. I drank some and left it on a desk again and went off to complete my work tasks.

My trainers are left in a side room in the warehouse. There is no CCTV in this room.

Obsess about whether the furniture layout is appropriate for functional use. Whoever's sitting in this chair won't be able to reach the coffee table. If you were standing at the sink there and someone opened the door, they might hit you. No one wants to reach around a door to flip a light switch. This shelf can't go where it's obviosuly supposed to go because it's too close to the shower and everything will get wet. Buying a ton of extra cabinets for a job because the ""correct"" orientation puts the sink way too far away from the dishwasher.
2. Similar to the above - discover extremely powerful convictions I didn't know I had about where a toilet should be relative to a door. Ideally directly across the room or across on a diagonal. Not to close to a door. And for the love of god - NOT directly next to a door on the same wall.
3. In a job that already has art, slap it all on the ceiling to get it out of the way.
4. (HF1) Clean all the furniture before selling it, because no one would buy a couch with mysterious red stains on it.
5. (HF2) Lug around partial containers of tiles and paint even though money is no object, because I feel like it's wasteful to sell them.
6. (HF1) Destroy the bottom half of a wall first and then whack the top half so it all crashes down.
7. (HF2) Feel sad that I can't do that wall thing anymore because for some reason there's no gravity.
8. (HF2) Build random stairs everywhere instead of using ladders or scaffolding.
9. (HF1) Always mow the lawns (I don't even think that's weird tbh, what kind of person DOESN'T mow all the lawns??)

I then googled/reddited about maple blotching that it seems like all of you knew that you shouldn't stain maple.    
Well, a hard lesson learned..   

(Yes, I did everything correctly in regards to preparation: sanded down to 220 with proper dust collection until all surfaces were smooth, vacumed, wiped, and blew off the dust that had collected, used a pre-stain, wiped it off before it dried, stained for 10 minutes then removed the excess).

1h532oz,https://www.reddit.com/r/bikemessengers/comments/1h532oz/winter_survival_guide/,Winter Survival Guide,"Retired messenger here with almost a decade of brutal Canadian winters under my belt. Been seeing some pretty batshit recommendations lately on here like wearing a wetsuit to work, so I thought I'd post an edited version of this guide that me and my colleagues at Chasseurs Courrier put together a few years ago. Feel free to comment your own tips and I'll add them in. 

**YOUR BIKE**

* have a cheap, somewhat disposable frame with wide tire clearance that you can switch parts off of when it eventually dies. Salt and constant moisture will inevitably rust your frame and possibly crack it. Don't ride your prized high-end steel bike, you'll kill it. If you ride a cargo bike just take extra care to clean and maintain it to extend its life. 

* aluminum, carbon, and titanium don’t rust if you can afford it. 

* rust check spray the inside of your frame, or coat the inside with linseed oil. Rotate your frame while it dries for full coverage 

* most folks go with either a cheap steel track frame or an old 90’s rigid mtb. If you’ve got the cash the ideal long-term winter bike would be a second-hand aluminum gravel, cyclocross, or tracklocross frame. 

* Schwalbe CX Pros, comes in 700 or 26. At 32mm they’re narrow enough to fit on most frames, and they offer decent puncture protection. If you can only afford one, put it on the front. Any other cyclocross tire with a decent tread will do if you can’t find them. Depending on how much snow you get, marathons do pretty good too. 

* big 2 inch mtb tires tend to just float on top of the snow and are way less stable. Ice tends to build up between the treads too. Try to find something somewhat narrow to cut a path through to the pavement

* studded tires for the most part aren’t really worth it. Depending on where you live, snow removal is usually prioritized in the downtown core and most of the time you’ll just be grinding down the studs on bare pavement anyways. Realistically they only make a noticeable difference on the handful of days when you have a snowstorm or the roads for some reason haven’t been plowed. You can definitely make it through a winter without them, and that money could be better spent on decent winter clothing. If you’re riding a 20” front wheel on a cargo bike or fork then it’s a different story. A good strategy is to have an extra front wheel with a studded tire already mounted that you can quickly throw on in the morning if it's gonna be a shitty day.

* regular road brakes don’t perform that well in the snow. Disc, canti or V-brakes are preferable. Kool-Stop pads will last way longer than the cheap kind. Riding fixed gear is the most dependable, low-maintenance brake you can have in the snow, just avoid skidding (throw a front brake on for emergencies, no one cares)

* give your bike a shower once every 2 weeks or so, it will extend the life of basically every single component and save you a ton of money. 

* salt and grime will wear out your drive train super fast. Keep an eye on it and give your chain a quick wipe down after every shift, and grease it with wet lube almost every single day. Give your chain about half the life expectancy you would give one in the summer. 

* grease every moving part or thing with threads at the start of winter to avoid anything getting seized. Particularly your seatpost, BB, pedal threads, and axle bolts. 

* if possible bring your bike inside at night. Use a car brush to get as much snow off the frame and rest it on some plastic shoe trays or a 2-person sled to save your floors. This will reward you with free salt when the water evaporates. 

* dropping your tire pressure to the minimum recommendation does amazing things for traction. If you feel yourself slipping out constantly, let out a few bursts of air. 

* tubeless tires allow for ridiculously low tire pressure without the threat of getting a pinch flat, although I wouldn’t  trust the sealant to work very well in the extreme cold if you were to hit some glass or something

* if you ride with pedal straps avoid the cordura and velcro kind (like YNOT or Holdfast). They will get soaking wet and make your feet cold. Try to find leather ones or old fashioned cages. 

* fenders, especially on the front, will save your feet a lot of punishment. If your bike doesn’t have fender mounts, SKS raceblades will fit almost any frame, or just zip tie some ass-savers for a bit of protection. Those cheap strap-on mtb downtube fenders also work pretty well. 

* avoid exposed cables, bypass the guides and just run full housing straight from the bars to your brake/derailleur to avoid ice building up inside. 

* if you have a front rack, zip tie a piece of election sign down the middle to save the boxes you’re carrying from turning to mush. 



**RIDING STYLE**


* take corners slow and wide. Try not to lean into turns, remain as upright as possible. Be ready to plant your inside foot if you slide out. 

* stay in the saddle as much as possible, your back wheel will start skidding the moment you stand up, especially in low gears. 

* if you feel yourself starting to slide out, resist the urge to slam on your brakes. Plant your butt and focus on correcting yourself. Wide bars really help with the leverage needed to keep your front wheel straight. 

* if the snow is fresh, follow the paths of other bikes or cars. If it’s a few days old, then they’re likely icy rails of pain so carve your own path. 

* always watch the wheels of the car you’re following. Giant potholes are hiding under the snow so if you see a wheel suddenly dip then you know one is coming up 

* avoid riding over anything metal, especially early morning or when the sun goes down. Manhole covers, storm grates, tram tracks, and construction plates will all be super slippery. If you have no choice, ride as straight a line as possible and keep your hands off the brakes. 

* following the snow plow is generally a good idea, but keep in mind they can sometimes act more like Zambonis and just leave a smooth sheet of ice behind them. Or they can shoot road salt directly in your face. 

* if you ride with gears, on really sloppy days your derailleurs can sometimes get clogged with ice. Treat your bike more like a single speed and only shift out of a mid range if absolutely necessary. Fixed gear doesn’t have this issue, just ride a slightly lower ratio than you would in the summer tho. 

* not all roads get plowed consistently. It’s always faster and easier to ride an extra block or two on the main roads than to take a shortcut on a super sketchy and icy side street. 

* Ride slow and anticipate red lights. You’re most likely to bail while cornering, braking, or accelerating from a dead stop. Try to keep momentum and never come to a complete stop if possible. 

* plan to dismount or hop the curb at the corner of your drop, not in the middle of the block so you don’t have to climb over a mountain of snow. 



**YOUR HANDS**


* get some bar mitts. They work super well and are way more convenient than having to constantly deal with taking off or putting on gloves. A pair of touchscreen dollar store gloves inside is all you’ll need, or you can throw some hand warmers inside. Zip tie them down to discourage opportunistic thieves. Krubby mitts are the gold standard. Only downside is if you bail it’s kind of sketchy to get your hands out in time. If you ride brakeless throw some dummy levers or bar-ends on to stop them from flopping around everywhere. 

* try to find touchscreen gloves that have silicon grips on the palm so you're not fumbling your envelopes or boxes.

* if you just use gloves, find some wind-proof shells to put on top of thin touchscreen gloves. Figure out a way to clip them to your sleeves or run a string through your coat pre-school style so you don’t accidentally leave them on a receptionist’s desk somewhere. 

* big puffy ski mitts are generally a bad idea. They don’t offer much grip on your bars and you might overheat. Snowmobile gloves or cross-country ski gloves are preferable.

* alloy handlebars are heat sinks, meaning that they’ll actively draw heat away from you and make your hands more cold. You can counteract this by getting super thick ESI silicon grips which won’t transfer heat. Ideally find some cheap carbon bars on Aliexpress, they won’t get nearly as cold. 

* silicon brake lever covers. Makes only the tiniest difference but they also just look cool AF. 



**YOUR FEET**


* thin merino socks with thick ones on top. Costco has the best and cheapest merino socks amazingly. On particularly wet days wear a pair of waterproof socks on top (the kind that are like little rain jackets, not the soft fabric kind)

* plastic bagel bags are surprisingly decent waterproof socks in a pinch. 

* double layering socks that are too tight in your shoes can cause circulation issues and this is **VERY BAD AND DANGEROUS**. Buy your shoes a size bigger to allow more room for socks. 

* get some decent waterproof boots with a good grip. Solomons are pretty good. Shimano has some pretty cheap and pretty good winter clipless boots 

* like metal bars, metal pedals will make your feet cold. Luckily plastic mtb pedals are very cheap and easy to find. 

* dollar store insulated insoles. They do way more than you would think. 

* hiking gaiters are great for keeping snow from hitting your shins and melting into your shoes. Snow only really hits you from the knees down so they’re preferable to full length waterproof pants, which will only make you overheat and might get caught in your chain. They're also much easier to take off if the weather changes and you don't need them.  

* for wet shoes, stuff them with newspaper overnight, or invest in a little shoe drier thingy. Drying your shoes on the radiator, especially if they’re leather, can burn or crack them if you’re not careful. An elevated shoe rack is ideal for airflow and will dry them faster. If you have clipless boots, make sure they’re not soles-down in a pool of water overnight, that’s guaranteed to rust your cleats in place forever. 

* don’t fuck around with shoe covers. The amount of walking you’ll do will just shred them to pieces. 

* also don’t fuck around with BOA laces. The ratchets will get clogged up with grime or the wires will just snap in the extreme cold. 

* if you know you’re gonna be on standby indoors for a while, take your shoes off. It lets the water evaporate faster and will be a bit warmer when you head back out. 



**YOUR BODY**


* avoid wearing anything cotton, especially on your lower body. Cotton is extremely absorbent and will hold freezing cold water next to your body. 

* merino everything. It’s less absorbent and will at least hold that bit of water closer to body temperature. Only thing not to get in merino is gloves, it’s one drawback is that it’s extremely fragile and gloves will just get holes in them right away. Decathlon is your best option for cheap merino clothes. Check the hunting section, they often have better options for warm and windproof/waterproof gear. 

* you probably do this already, but wear all black clothing. Black absorbs the most wavelengths of light of any colour, and this extra light energy is converted into heat. It’s not much but marginal gains amirite?

* you should be a bit cold when you first leave your house. It’s way worse to overdress and get sweaty right away, you’ll pay for it when you stop moving. Ride a little hard at first or do some jumping jacks or something to get your body heat up and you’ll feel fine. Develop a system where you know exactly what to wear for every temperature without being too cold or too hot. 

* puffy down jackets are great, but they don’t stand up to abrasion very well. You’ll probably develop holes around your shoulders or armpits from wearing a bag, and if you crash it’ll probably just slice open. Throw a cheap windbreaker on top to protect it. 

* your greatest foe is not so much the cold, but the wind. Having a windproof top layer will be way more effective than 100 layers of soft clothing. A rain jacket when it’s wet or a quilted plaid construction coat when it’s dry. 

* tuck in your shirt, a lot of heat is lost through the opening at your waist and it makes a world of difference. 

* if you have to pee, do it right away! Your body prioritizes and expends a lot of energy to keep your bladder warm, energy that could instead be going to your hands or feet. 

* the sun will rise and/or set during your shift in the deepest days of winter. Dress in layers and always carry an extra pair of socks, gloves, and a top layer to adjust to the sudden temperature change. 

* wear ski goggles or clear construction glasses to deal with the snow. Big fuck you speed shades like pit vipers also do well to keep your face less wind chapped. Careful you don’t get caught wearing darkly tinted lenses when the sun goes down.

* photochromic lenses - just a fancy word for transitions. Perfect for all conditions so you don’t have to swap lenses when it gets dark. You can find cheap non-prescription cycling ones on Amazon or Aliexpress. 

* wear a dang helmet. You **WILL** fall at least once. Get a skull cap or winter cycling cap to fit underneath. A merino buff can also be turned into a hat or face mask. 

* Gore-Tex is kind of a scam and isn’t even its original chemical formula anymore. It’s just a marketing ploy that costs nearly double, and the new formula is basically the same as all its competitors. Any decent outdoor gear labelled waterproof is often just as good if not better, and is wayyy cheaper. 

* cold in: cold out. If you’re leaving your house or office and your hands or feet are already freezing, it’ll only get worse. You need them to be warm before you leave. 



**YOUR GEAR**


* hot boxes are obviously essential for food delivery. Or just line your bag with emergency blankets.  

* take care where you put your bag down to load/unload. No one wants a salty wet bag dripping on your butt. A wet bag will make the food you’re delivering colder, faster. 

* most phones will just immediately die when it gets below freezing. Ditch your phone pouch for the next few months and just put your phone in your pocket, or keep it plugged into a battery pack the entire time. Also try to use it indoors only if possible. 

* beer coozies can add a little protection to keep your phone alive, or get an insulated pouch from a ski store. They’re kind of a pain in the ass to get your phone in and out of quickly tho. 

* some of the cheaper iPhones won’t unlock even with touchscreen gloves. You can bypass having to use the home button by enabling AssitiveTouch in the accessibility settings. 

* make your homescreen just all multiple copies of the button to whatever app you use at work. Saves a lot of time with the awkwardness of using touchscreen gloves. 

* people are shitty and like to steal lights. I find it’s better to lose cheap $5 lights rather than fancy $50 ones. If you're riding in the city you only really need them to be seen, rather than to actually see with. Carry multiples or extra batteries since they’ll be on basically the entire time during a night shift. Zip ties are sometimes enough to discourage thieves. 

* carry a little bottle of lock de-icer or hand sanitizer if your lock freezes. Or heat up your key with a lighter if you’re really in a pinch. 

* if your lock is really gummed up, put a few drops of chain lube in the key hole and blast it with compressed air to clean it out. 

* keep your key on a leather or nylon dangly. The stretchy plastic kind will get super limp and fall off, or just snap completely in half. 



**MISC**


* standby can be tricky during the winter. As long as you have your work gear and look the part you should be able to hang out in the lobby of any office building without being hassled. Wander around and look busy riding the elevators if security gives you a hard time, or wait in line at a bank if there’s one. University buildings, museums, or subway stations are good too, most big chain coffee shops won’t hassle you if you hang around without buying anything. You can always wander around grocery or drug stores pretending to shop too. 

* if you’re delivering food to an apartment building, hang out in the lobby for as long as possible if you’re not in a rush. If anyone hassles you just say you’re waiting for a customer to come down. 

* if your nose gets really runny like mine, just use the ol’ snot rocket technique. Plug one nostril, lean over, and blow hard and short. Do it while riding and no one will notice, just look behind you so that you don’t spray a fellow cyclist. 

* you burn a lot of extra calories trying to stay warm. Never work on an empty stomach and carry lots of snacks. Bring a hot thermos with you to clutch and warm yourself up. 

* if anyone says to you “I sure couldn’t do your job in this weather!”, the correct response is “Darling, you couldn’t do my job in any weather”",6,1733166955.0,bikemessengers,1,0.88,False

Suddenly my apartment manager wants to start a new policy for pest control, requiring us to empty pantry, cabinets, clear counters, and remove pets from the property completely. She has created a new addendum for this new policy, but I am in the middle of my lease and have not even seen this new addendum nor have I signed it. Even so, I tried my best to satisfy her, by emptying my cabinets and pantry, but all of my stuff does not fit on my coffee table so I had to use one of my counters. Also, I have a cat and did not have time or funds to get him a vet visit for a boarding shot in time and put him in boarding so I locked him in my bedroom which blocks my bathroom. She issued me a lease violation notice with an $85 fee for not complying. But none of this is in my lease, so how can she do that? I asked her to remove it and not send pest control again today because I dont want my cat to dash the door and get lost but she sent him anyway and luckily I was home to prevent him from escaping. I'm curious dear readers, is she violating the lease by trying to impose a new change without my consent, charging me this fee, and endangering my cat? 

This is what my lease says in regards to changes: ""Lease Changes. Lease changes are only allowed during the Lease term or renewal period if governed by Par. 10, specifed in Special Provisions in Par. 32, or by a written addendum or amendment signed by you and us. At or after the end of the initial Lease term, Rent increases will become efective with at least 5 days plus the number of days’ advance notice contained in Box F on page 1 in writing from us to you. Your new Lease,  which may include increased Rent or Lease changes, will begin on the date stated in any advance notice we provide (without needing your signature) unless you give us written move-out notice under Par. 25, which applies only to the end of the current Lease term or renewal period.""

Section 10 of my lease: 10. Community Policies. Community Policies become part of this 
Lease and must be followed. We may make changes, including additions, to our written Community Policies, and those changes can become efective immediately if the Community Policies are distributed and applicable to all units in the apartment community and do not 
change the dollar amounts owed under this Lease. 
10.1. Photo/Video Release. You give us permission to use any photograph, likeness, image or video taken of you while you are using property common areas or participating in 
any event sponsored by us. 
10.2. Disclosure of Information. At our sole option, we may, but are not obligated to, share and use information related to this Lease for law-enforcement, governmental, or business 
purposes. At our request, you authorize any utility provider to give us information about pending or actual connections or disconnections of utility service to your apartment.
10.3. Guests. We may exclude from the apartment community any guests or others who, in our sole judgment, have been violating the law, violating this Lease or our Community Policies, or disturbing other residents, neighbors, visitors, 
or owner representatives. We may also exclude from any outside area or common area anyone who refuses to show photo identifcation or refuses to identify himself or herself as a resident, an authorized occupant, or a guest of a specifc resident in the community. Anyone not listed in this Lease cannot stay in the apartment for more than _______ days in one week without our prior written consent, and no more than twice 
that many days in any one month. If the previous space isn’t flled in, 2 days total per week will be the limit.
10.4. Notice of Convictions and Registration. You must notify us within 15 days if you or any of your occupants: (A) are convicted of any felony, (B) are convicted of any misdemeanor involving a controlled substance, violence to another person, or destruction of property, or (C) register as a 
sex ofender. Informing us of a criminal conviction or sex-ofender registration doesn’t waive any rights we may have against you.
10.5. Odors, Noise and Construction. You agree that odors and smells (including those related to cooking), everyday noises or sounds related to repair, renovation, improvement, or construction in or around the property are all a normal part of a multifamily living environment and that it is impractical for us to prevent them from penetrating your apartment.""

Section 32 says: ""Special Provisions. The following, or attached Special Provisions and 
any addenda or Community Policies provided to you, are part of this Lease and supersede any conficting provisions in this Lease. No pets without pet deposit. After 2
returned checks, cashier's check or
money order required. No personal
checks accepted after the 4th""

There is an animal addendum but there is nothing about removing pets for pest control and pest control is only mentioned in my lease under a section regarding bed bugs. The manager says she made a new addendum but I confirmed with the office that I have not signed it, and still have not even seen it. I emailed asking her to fix this issue, but she has ghosted me completely. Is she violating the lease?

Edit: I forgot to mention that for the last several years I have locked him in my bedroom without any problem and this is the first time I have had to empty my pantry and cabinets as well. This is all new. Pest control uses to use a roach bait paste inside cabinets, but it never required removal of dishes or pantry goods and electronics off of the counter. I think they are now spraying instead of using the paste. Also, I have never complained about roaches. I see one or two at the beginning of the summer, the pest control guy comes with his paste and I never see any more until the next year. ",0,1733166831.0,legaladvice,2,0.5,False

So it’s a bright Tuesday morning, and I’m sipping my coffee in blissful ignorance, unaware that one of my clinic’s 3Ls is about to light their legal career on fire in family court. At the time, I thought my biggest problem was whether the Wi-Fi in the office would hold up for the afternoon’s Zoom meeting. Turns out, the real disaster was brewing in the courtroom.

The case? A $10k divorce. Simple. You could write a memo on this in 2Ls’ first semester and still have time to squeeze in a lunch break. But no, not for this student. Instead, they submitted a 45-page Frankenstein’s monster of a brief that was so bloated with block quotes, I briefly considered submitting it to the Guinness World Records for “Longest Legal Document About Absolutely Nothing.”

The red flags didn’t stop there. Oh no. My star pupil—using the term loosely—graced the court with phrases like “opposing council” (twice!) and a baffling reference to “binding president,” which had me questioning whether I’d accidentally signed them up for a political science clinic instead of family law. To add insult to injury, they cited cases so old they might as well have referenced the Magna Carta, blissfully unaware those cases were bad law in our jurisdiction. I can only assume they Googled “divorce case law” and copy-pasted the results into their brief.

The real performance began in court. Opposing counsel—clearly a seasoned professional who smelled blood in the water—tried to get things moving. But instead of gracefully admitting their mistakes, my student decided to double down. It started with a trickle: stammering, awkward pauses, and enough sweat to irrigate a small farm. Then came the flood—a long-winded objection that involved a butchered explanation of stare decisis, which they called a “core tenant,” as though the law is renting an apartment somewhere.

But the pièce de résistance? My student personally attacked opposing counsel, accusing them of incompetence while said counsel remained calm and collected, presumably daydreaming about their post-hearing golf game. By this point, I was tempted to fake a power outage in the courthouse just to end the misery.

When the hearing mercifully ended, I thought the worst was over. Wrong. The judge called to tell me about the debacle, delivering the news with the tone of someone breaking the word count on an email they shouldn’t have to send. Naturally, I apologized profusely and promised to address the issue with the student. And I did! But the real kicker? The student didn’t get it. They’re walking around campus claiming they’re the victim, saying this was an indictment of the “state of the profession” and the “rule of law.” No, buddy, it’s an indictment of your inability to proofread.

Now, I’ve supervised many clinic students over the years—some excellent, some forgettable—but this one will go down in history as the biggest WTF moment of my career. I can only hope they learn from this and become a better advocate, but for now, all I can do is apologize to the judge, stockpile antacids, and hope next week’s cases don’t involve any of my other students turning the courtroom into a comedy club.",20,1733166409.0,LawSchool,0,0.81,False

* Sights: explore town (Aotea Square, Sky Tower, Auckland Art Gallery)
* Eats: Gemmayze Street, Giapo, Silo Park Sat Food Market, Receptionist Coffee/Stolen Summer
* Skipping: Rangitoo Island and Waiheke Island given lack of time/energy

Day 2 - Hobbiton/Rotorua

* Saw there are tours on Klook for Hobbiton + Rotorua
* Question: worth seeing Rotorua in this way or pushing it for a future trip? If yes, any thoughts on Te Puia vs Wai-O-Tapu? Alternative is Waitomo Caves which seem intriguing how unique it is

Day 3 - Fly to Queenstown (pick up rental car) + stay at Te Anau

* Sights: Queenstown Gardens. Potentially Glowworm Caves, esp if we don't do Waitomo
* Eats: Fergburger, Patagonia Chocolates
* Question: Any activity worth slotting here? Otherwise, can make for a slower day so we can wake up earlier the next day

Day 4 - Milford Sound

* Sights: Mirror Lakes, Key Summit Hike (off the Divide), Chasm, Homer Tunnel, Monkey Creek
* Question: Is the Milford Sound Nature Cruise a must (in lieu of Key Summit Hike potentially)? Otherwise I can always save that or the Oversight Cruise when I come with a significant other
* Question: Worth making the drive back to Queenstown vs staying at Te Anau again?

Day 5 - Queenstown -> Wanaka

* Sights/Activities: Arrowtown (likely just a casual stroll in town, though hear e-biking to some wineries is highly recommended?); climbing at Wildwire Wanaka; ThatWanakaTree, Secret Sauna (maybe)
* Eats: Pedro's House of Lamb (TBD on timing), Kika or Wanafusion?
* Skipping: Shotover and other Queenstown activities. Anything I'm overlooking here? Could I fit in a drive in Glenorchy (though seems ambitious, unless I change day 8)

Day 6 - Wanaka -> Twizel

* Sights/Activities: Roys Peak
* Eats: Big Fig Wanaka
* Question: does staying at Twizel seem like the optimal move given Day 7?

Day 7 - Hooker Valley -> Lake Tekapo

* Sights/Activities: Hooker Valley Track, Kea Point, Mt Cook Alpine Salmon Shop, Lake Tekapo, Lupin Field, Mt John Observatory
* Eats: TBD
* Question: Is the Day Sky Project worth the price or are airbnbs/hotels in the area sufficient? Open to splurging given its maybe the only time I may be in this area
* Skipping: helicopter glacier hikes around Fox Glacier etc

Day 8 - Christchurch

* Sights/Activities: Opuke Thermal Pools (worthwhile? mostly since there may not be a ton to do in Christchurch), Turanga Library 
* Eats: Fairlie Bakehouse, Unknown Chapter Coffee, Little High Eatery, Cellar Door, Londo or 5th Street
* Question: I was leaning to this since it means new roads to drive and a bit closer to Auckland, but not sure if I can change some things where I end up back in Queenstown to fly out of? Lake Tekapo is a bit half way inbetween Christchurch and Queenstown it seems. 
* Skipping: Godley Head

Day 9 - Fly to Auckland to fly out

* Question: Is Air NZ meaningfully better than Jetstar? Either way, planning to book an early flight that has multiple backup routes ahead of when we depart Auckland 

  
Appreciate you reading to the end! I hope attempted balancing maximizing the limited days I have with not constant driving well enough, but I could be underestimating NZ roads/traffic so thank you for your feedback!",1,1733166370.0,travel,3,1.0,False

1h52r0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1h52r0i/i_think_public_school_traumatized_me/,I think public school traumatized me,"Okay, maybe ""traumatized"" is a bit dramatic, but I couldnt think of a better word. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit but I couldn't think of a better one. I read the rules three times, so I think this post is allowed.

A bit of background info: I'm 17, live in Canada, and have level 2 autism with severe social anxiety. I was not diagnosed with either during the time I was in school, though.

I've always had issues with going to school since I was really little, but it only got worse as I grew older. It was a constant fight every day to get me to go, I would scream and cry and beg to stay home. During the first few hours of school if they actually got me there, I would stay in the principals office trying to convince her I was sick, and calming down from the morning tantrum. I don't know why I hated school so much, but I was scared all the time, even after school and on weekends I was filled with dread knowing I would have to go right back.

I was bullied, but not severe enough to warrant this type of reaction, and only towards the end. I always got good grades, not perfect, but above average, so I had no reason to worry about that either. I got a bit better in junior high, for the most part I was able to get myself on the bus since my parents were both working. Only for the first half of the year, then I started having problems again, worse now that I couldn't spend the mornings with the principal since it was a new school, as well as losing the ability to bring a stuffed toy, I was allowed in elementary, not junior high. The first half of the year was still rough, I was terrified to talk to my classmates I had known all my life, and sometimes I would puke in the morning from anxiety. After the tantrums started again, I was pulled out and homeschooled instead.

I'm still homeschooled, and it's way better now, but it still affects me. I dream about school every night without fail, about my old classmates even though I haven't seen them in years. I know other people have school dreams when they're out of school, but theirs are always normal, if bad, only because they'd forgotten a test or something similar. Mine are all normal, but I still wake up with a racing heart, and am terrified in my dreams. Sometimes in the dream I have accommodations, like I can go home whenever I want, or I have shorter weeks than everyone else, but the dread persists. On the rare occasion I'm not at school in the dream, my classmates are all still there. Some nights I cant sleep because I know it will be the same thing every night.

If I have an early appointment, like 0800 or anything, I usually have to hold back tears in the car because it reminds me of school. In late elementary-early middle school, I would drink coffee in the mornings, so the smell of coffee also puts me in a panic. I had to cut off everyone I knew from school because I'd get so nervous talking to them, but I could talk to everyone else just fine. I don't understand why I'm still so scared, as far as I can tell my experience was mostly normal, maybe not the bullying, but it was very minor. (Teasing, nothing physical or too serious)

I don't really know why I'm posting this. Maybe to find anyone else with the same experience, or just to get it off my chest. I already am in therapy before I get those comments, he knows everything about this. Thank you for reading if you read it all, it's a bit disorganized I think, it's rushed, I wrote this on my phone.

I got a coffee advent calendar, which is supposedly for espresso, from Pact. I got it pre-ground so I could have a usual coffee in the bean grinder for 2nd/3rd cups.

The problem is twice now, the coffee seems to just explode out of the portafilter, it goes everywhere, even through the top. I don't really know how to diagnose it, and seeing as I have 23 of these left I'd like to figure it out lol.

The grounds are actually really quite coarse, it's not a nice powder, it's more on the side of ground coffee than espresso. They offered Bean or Ground, now I think ground wasn't meant for espresso perhaps. Do I maybe get a cheap manual grinder to grind these into more of a powder?

I also have to remove some of the grounds from the portafilter, as the 18g it comes with overfills it. The first day I didn't notice this, today I thought that might be why the water was going everywhere but even after using that Sage portafilter skimmer thingy it still exploded.

Look, I’ve seen a lot from behind my little mechanical stenograph machine. I’ve clocked more hours in courtrooms than the judge’s coffee maker, and I’m rarely surprised anymore. But the moment this family law veteran strutted into the courtroom, Zyn tucked under his lip like a battle-ready tobacco cowboy, I knew I was in for a show.

Let me set the stage: family court, a $10k divorce case—a matter so routine, you’d think the lawyers were there to order lunch rather than litigate. The veteran attorney breezed in with the confidence of someone who’s billed more hours than I’ve spent breathing. And then there was the 3L. Oh, sweet, ambitious, caffeinated 3L, armed with a 45-page brief so thick I considered using it as a booster seat.

I’m not sure what gave me the bigger workout: keeping a straight face or typing out the judge’s eyebrows mid-arch when they glanced at the student’s opus. To be fair, everyone starts somewhere, but the sheer audacity of citing unpublished opinions as precedent? Bold. It was like showing up to a chess match with checkers pieces and expecting a trophy.

The veteran attorney, meanwhile, looked over the brief like it had personally insulted him. He popped in another Zyn (I swear, the man’s blood type must be nicotine) and leaned back, ready for the court equivalent of watching a car skid on black ice. His body language practically screamed, “Alright, kid, show me what you’ve got.”

And oh, did the student show us. They began their argument with the gusto of someone trying to sell beachfront property in Wyoming. The judge, bless their heart, listened patiently before gently reminding the 3L that there’s a difference between passion and, well, coherence. It was a masterclass in judicial restraint. I’m over here typing furiously, trying not to chuckle at the way the 3L kept digging, as if deeper holes would somehow reveal gold.

Then it happened—the cardinal sin of law school advocacy: arguing with the judge. This is the courtroom equivalent of swatting a beehive because you think you’ve got fast reflexes. The veteran attorney didn’t even flinch. If anything, he looked mildly amused, like a dad watching his kid insist they can ride a bike without training wheels… as they wobble straight into a mailbox.



By the time the 3L objected for the record, the judge was serving guidance counselor realness, and the veteran attorney had mentally checked out. I could see him eyeing his briefcase, probably fantasizing about the unopened Celsius he’d stashed away for more “important” cases. Meanwhile, I’m typing faster than the student was sinking.

Here’s the kicker: the attorney and the judge are golf buddies. You can bet your last caselaw-citing brain cell that this story’s going to make it to the 18th hole on Sunday. The attorney’s already planning the punchline while the 3L, bless their soul, is likely going home to rethink everything from their brief-writing skills to their caffeine intake.

Or am I being used for a free meal/drink?","Looking for constructive criticism. Please ask anything you want, and I'll try to be as unbiased as possible. My goal is to be better.

I've been on Hinge for about 6 months now. In that time, I've been on 11 first dates. And zero second dates.

I know that's not a huge sample size, but I'm still trying to see if there's something I'm doing wrong. None of these dates went terrible, at least in my mind. I followed the usual etiquette, took effort in looking good, tried to engage in thoughtful conversations, and be funny when I can. I don't try and force physical contact, or make suggestive comments. I try to keep the first date friendly and casual, without making them feel like I'm trying too hard.  

The way I see it, none of them were bad dates. In fact, I had a good time on every single one. And the girl did too. Or at least it seemed that way.
 
Whenever I match with someone, I try to engage for a few days and then plan to meet as soon as possible. I always suggest drinks or an activity for a first date since coffee usually doesn't work with a full-time job. If we stay for long and the date is going fine, I'll bring up dinner. I always pay, and I don't mind it either. Everything is fine, till the next day when I end up getting ghosted. Some girls will text for a couple more messages before disappearing. There's only been ONE exception where the girl had the decency to text me that she didn't feel the spark, and it's nothing personal. And for that, I'll always remember her. 

So is it that I'm a bad first date? Or am I just being used for a free meal/drink? The reason I've started feeling this way is because the way some of my conversations have gone on hinge. So many matches expect me to take them to the ""nicest restaurant"" I know, or wine and dine them... and as soon as I suggest anything otherwise, the conversation is dead.


Here's what I'm afraid of: maybe I THINK all of these dates went great, while in reality they didn't. And in that case I don't even know where to begin.

I went NC for this last straw. Hubby says I am misunderstanding. I call BS.  ,"Their grandson (my nephew-in-law) is in the process of getting a divorce. MIL and FIL are in their 80's. The grandson is 35. He is married with one child -call him FAH (f\*ckingAH--weighs 350 lbs solid) and his future ex-wife we will call her Tiny (maybe 100 lbs in a wet wool sweater). Not weight shaming--but the difference is important. 

Over Thanksgiving MIL/FIL were talking shit about Tiny. They called her selfish. They called her distant. They hated her for the most minor things (unable to quickly order food at a restaurant because she has multiple food allergies). They hated her for the most major things (not allowing the MIL to stay at their home while they were at work because MIL has a very profound history of snooping and stealing). They just hated her. However, I like her. I think she is a sweetheart. 

As they are dumping her name all over the ground, I can't take it. Because she is a kind person, and I have integrity, I interject. I explained the reason why Tiny does not want FAH to know where she is moving after the divorce may be directly related to her need for safety.  Earlier this year, FAH got very mad at Tiny. Instead of using his words, he threw her over his knee and \*spanked\* her. Truth is, he beat on her back, legs, and buttocks until his hand hurt. 

I'll give you a minute to digest that. It is 2024. This happened in February 2024. 

Then digest this--FIL and MIL were laughing so hard, tears were running down their faces. 

I had to explain that their grandson just committed an assault on his wife, the mother of their great-grandchild and he did so in front of said child. The child is barely 3. 

Instead of addressing the fact they just learned their grandson physically assaulted a woman, his wife, in front of their child, they issued concerns FAH relayed to them the 3 y-o might be gay. Yes, a homosexual. \*GASP\*

JFC!!!! 

I got up, and put my coffee mug on the counter. I said, ""Goodbye.""  I privately told my husband I would never set foot in their house again, nor would I ever communicate with them again. Ever. I am full NC at this point. 

Hubby thinks I am overreacting. I think they are under-reacting. Now I have gone full NC because of a 'Thanksgiving gratitude' debacle and this conversation. 

Disclaimer: I never really connected with my inlaws. They are shifty and sneaky kind of folks. So I avoid them whenever possible. This just gives me the final permission to never have to occupy the same space ever again.  Hubby can go visit whenever he wants.

I do IF purely for maintaining good health and the blood sugar related benefits, so I wake up and have black coffee every morning, eat my first meal around noon and try to not eat after 8pm so I give myself 16 hours of fast most days and I've been doing this for over 2 years. My body weight hasn't really dropped but my visceral fat (fat around organs) definitely has dropped as well as just subcutaneous and overall fat.

To get to my actual question - I recently tried adding coconut oil to my coffee for the MCT benefits. I really like the smooth feeling it gives with the caffeine and I feel like I am energize well throughout the day with no afternoon coffee crash. However, I read about the MCT and it says that MCT is fully of triglycerides which are tiny tiny chains of fats that the body can burn really easily. There are also other added digestive benefits which is awesome. 

Due to the triglycerides giving my body fuel, I would assume this would knock me out of a fast because I am consuming something for my body to digest. Is this right? 

Bonus points for anyone who can give me the pro/con of IF vs the MCT benefits.

I’m looking for advice and recommendations on a high-performance laptop to buy my boyfriend for Christmas and trying to take advantage of some sales today. He’s heavily into crypto trading and manages multiple wallets, so I want to get him something that’s tailored to his needs. Specifically, he’s been eyeing dual-screen laptops, so that’s a feature I definitely want to include.

# What I’m Looking For:

1. **Performance:**
   * A powerful processor is a must—something that can handle multiple trading platforms, software, and tabs running simultaneously without lag. I’ve heard good things about Intel Core i7 or i9 processors, or their AMD equivalents like the Ryzen 7 or 9. Any insights on which is better for this use case?
   * At least 16GB of RAM (maybe 32GB if necessary?). I want this laptop to be future-proof for at least a few years.
2. **Dual-Screen Functionality:**
   * He needs dual-screens for work so I figured having this feature would be helpful for working from home.  What do you think about laptops like the ASUS ZenBook Duo series, which have an additional screen above the keyboard. I think the extra screen space will help him monitor multiple charts, portfolios, and news feeds simultaneously. Are there other dual-screen options I should consider, or is the ZenBook Duo the best choice in this category?
3. **Graphics:**
   * He’s not into gaming, so I don’t think we need a top-tier GPU. However, I’d still like decent graphics capability for smooth visuals, especially when dealing with chart-heavy crypto platforms.
4. **Portability:**
   * He works from home most of the time but occasionally takes his laptop to coworking spaces or coffee shops. So, a balance between portability and screen size would be ideal—nothing overly bulky.
5. **Storage:**
   * Since he deals with crypto wallets, I assume a fast SSD is critical. Should I aim for 1TB storage, or would 512GB with external options suffice?
6. **Price Range:**
   * I’m flexible but would prefer to stay under $3,000. If there’s something amazing slightly above that, I’m open to suggestions.

# Additional Questions:

* **Brand reliability:** Are there brands better suited for this kind of work? I’ve heard mixed things about ASUS, Dell, and Lenovo, but I’m not sure which is most reliable for heavy workloads.
* **Battery life:** Are dual-screen laptops known for poor battery life? If so, how manageable is this with external batteries or chargers?
* **Warranty and support:** Since this is an investment, I’d prefer a laptop with a solid warranty and good customer support.

I want this to be a practical and thoughtful gift that he’ll genuinely love and use every day. If you’ve got personal experience with dual-screen laptops or use your laptop for trading, I’d love to hear about what works for you.

Thanks in advance for your help! I’m not super tech-savvy, so any guidance on what to look out for or avoid would be hugely appreciated.

This post carries that as well.  And IT'S NOT YOURS TO SHARE. I choose not to leave a paper trail when sorting out my brain for this reason.

I like receiving feedback often enough that I don't lock my posts.  I forget that reading and comprehension as well as following rules are not common sense or second nature to that many people.  The title of the sub is ""unsent letters: raw"" because the letter isn't intended to be sent, ya schmucks. These are probably the same fruit loops who respond to the letters of others as though the letters were written to or about them. That's also in the rules to NOT DO. JFC people. 

Don't fucking share this one either.  Reddit is supposed to be anonymous enough.  If i wanted to smear shit on the walls for people to share and see there are plenty of other outlets for that.

Quick context: I work in an office, train 3-4 times a week, and lately I've noticed that my hydration is terrible.

My typical day:
- I get up, I drink coffee (obviously)
- Between meetings and work I forget to drink water
- Training after the office (CrossFit/Functional)
- I come home dehydrated and with a headache

Signs that made me realize that something is not right:
- Dry lips all the time
- Headache after training
- I feel more tired than normal
- Very yellow urine (sorry about the TMI)

I already know the basics:
- Yes, you should drink more water
- Yes, coffee dehydrates
- Yes, I need electrolytes after training

What I have tried:
- I bought one of those big water bottles (it ends up being a decoration on my desk)
- I lowered the coffee (but I'm dying of sleep)
- I set alarms to drink water (I ignore them like snooze)
- Sports drinks (very sweet and expensive to drink daily)

I'm not looking for anything miraculous, just practical advice from people who have been through the same thing. What has worked for you to stay hydrated on a daily basis? Are there any supplements/electrolytes that are really worth it?",2,1733164877.0,Biohackers,39,0.56,False

I believe that the perfect ""come""  command where the dog runs back to you IMMEDIATELY when called is the number 1 priority. Like any skill or training  you have to practice and do it in the real world with distractions and exposure to potential hurdles.

MY DOG IS ALWAYS ON A LEASH when we practice this but it is a long lead, we've gone from 20 to 30 to 40 feet now and have been fairly successful. If there are people walking by the pup I also make it a point to wave at them for their attention and hold up the  lead in my hand then point to the dog as I call him back. I get thumbs up and nods of acknowledgement. Some folks slide a little further away because they're understandably not dog fans but this park has very low foot traffic anyway so it's not typically an issue until today.

We were doing our work and I recognized a man who has watched us before and I've pointed out the lead to many times. I gave him a friendly wave instead of the lead flag but the puppy decided to bound over towards him demand barking and play bowing excitedly. There's still plenty of distance between the man and the end of the lead. I'm calling at the dog, the puppy is ignoring me but as I go to reel in the line the man charged at my dog and threw an emptying coffee cup and a half eaten Danish thing I think, clearly scared. He then continued to charge towards me yelling about my lack of consideration, dog owners suck, cursing, the whole bit. 

I'm yanking puppy back shouting he's on a leash, stay still but the man is still stomping over but the pup is jumping around excitedly now probably wanting more Danish then when he realized the man was charging at me the energy shifted and he let out a deep growl. This caused the man to back off while still spitting obscenities as I apologized over and again and insisting he's leashed up and has been the whole time.

Am I an asshole? It's a baby dog that I want to be successful but this whole experience was a huge set back in his training with new reactivity and anxiety that wasn't there before. Its sad overall. ",0,1733164861.0,AmItheAsshole,38,0.3,False

In any beer section of a store selling US based craft beer, 80% of the beers are West Coast IPA.  To the extent there are other beers available, they are almost exclusively either lager/pilsner, coffee porters/stouts, or fruit flavored ales/sours.

There are dozens of styles but I guess no one cares to make the others.  It’s frustrating because I absolutely don’t need 70 different kinds of west coast ipa.  They all taste like citra or Amarillo hops.  

Yea this has been happening for the last decade but IMO it’s getting worse every year.  The funny thing is, this strategy seems to have the effect of driving people who really like to sample and try new beer to drink more and more imports, developing a taste preference for German, Belgian, and even UK/Irish beers.

Sometimes I lay in bed at night and I can’t stay asleep. Usually when this happens my mind instantly goes to my garden that I have lovingly cultivated over many years. It’s almost like a ritual: wake up, garden, do some light stretching and grab a glass of water.
My job as a page two journalist at Walrus Books, has me working right through the day. The pay isn’t the best, but I can get by selling my crops and paintings on the side. I know my writing is better than what my boss has me doing. Municipal rezonings, and dog catcher elections, amongst some of my recent articles, have me questioning my life choices.
Once again I have not been promoted, despite working myself to the point of burnout. “Nothing a bath with some lavender soaks can’t fix” I console myself. I get it, it sounds like I hate my job but I love it. My dream is to be a bestselling author, but we all have to start somewhere right? Maybe one day I’ll win a Starlight accolades award for my series of horror books but for now, this pays the bills.
Something strange has been happening lately. My husband Marcel, who you may know as a romance novelist, has started expressing his desire to work in botany. He is not exactly green-fingered so this came as a shock to me. As a supportive wife though, I encouraged him to follow his heart. Despite his divorce and never seeing his children, he always remains cheerful in demeanour but there is a mutual feeling of unease between us both.
He isn’t the only one acting strange...I too have been experiencing some weird things. Not long ago I was heading to my garden to harvest some basil and strawberries when mid stride, I stopped. I stood there as if struck by a sudden absence of thought. Instead, I headed over to my TV and turned on the dream home decorator channel. I usually wouldn’t watch such shows as I had no interest in DIY or interior design but I was unable to tear myself away from it.
I hate DIY. Yet over the next 4 hours, I found myself installing a bidet in our toilet, improving the water flow of our shower and upgrading our sinks to be more eco-friendly. I will admit it did make our lives easier but it made my hands hurt to an uncomfortable level. It wasn’t until 4am that I found myself shuffling into bed next to Marcel and falling into a deep restless sleep.
These things may sound odd but not outright alarming. Sure, people can change, it happens, however, things really took a turn for the outright terrifying not long after this.
My boss at Walrus books, sent me to a family, the Sigworths, who may as well live in the middle of nowhere desert lands. I had heard about this town before but never believed any of the weird things happening there. When I arrived, a concerned Dylan Sigworth ushered me into the living room and in a hushed tone, told me not to speak too loudly in case “they” hear us. I was about to ask who “they” were when he grabbed my shoulders and looked me in the eyes, flitting left to right, and said, “I was in my kitchen when I heard this faint cheery music and out of nowhere, my greenhouse just...disappeared!”.
I looked at him wearily, wondering if the stories I’d heard were born out of some kind of folie à deux spreading through the town, witnessed by outsiders like me. But that look in his eyes...I don’t know why, but I wanted to believe him. Not because this could be my big break as a writer, but because behind him, I could see the outline of where an outbuilding once was.
“This doesn’t make sense!” I proclaimed. “How can a greenhouse just go missing?? Right in front of your eyes?”. Dylan nodded sheepishly as if embarrassed, yet he stuck to his claim. This only convinced me further that he was telling the truth.
My head spinning, I sat at the kitchen table with Dylan as he told me about other unsettling things he had noticed since moving to the town a few months prior. In that same hushed tone, he explained how his wife worked for the military and was understandably, unable to divulge details of her work. Yet he wondered if something she had learned on the base had changed her as she didn’t quite seem like herself.
I also learned that their neighbours, the Smiths, were the centre of many controversies and rumours. The smiths had generations of family throughout the town though only a select few of them were ever spotted leaving their homes. Some speculated that they were to blame for things going missing. Not just things supposedly...but people too.
“Ok this is getting a little creepy”, I stated, finishing my cup of coffee. I wondered if Dylan had slipped something in my cup, but gave him the benefit of the doubt. I rose to put away my notepad and pen and moved to leave when he again put his hands on my shoulders and said, “Please don’t tell anyone I told you this. If I go missing though, I think you know where to look”. Nodding reassuringly I thanked him for his time and that I would be in touch shortly.
This was two weeks ago. Since then I have noticed more and more that the actions of myself and those around me made little sense. Stopping in the middle of something only to turn and do something unrelated, things disappearing out of seemingly nowhere, a sudden interest in things I never liked and continuing them even against my own desires. It feels as if something else in controlling me. Like I’m not the one making my own decisions. I wonder if anyone else feels the same...
I decided to write up my article and worked closely with Dylan who urged me to expose these happenings yet keep him anonymous. In every phone call, I could tell there was something he wanted to say, but he never did. Until today when I received the following message:
“Cynthia, What if I told you that we are all just in a simulation? I know. I know. It’s alarming, but there is a way out. I offer you a choice: You can either ignore this and go about your “Life”...Or you can come with me and we’ll see just how far down this rabbit hole goes. The choice is yours...”.

 I look up to the sky, I expect to see the sun, but instead, I see what I can only describe as a faint apparition of a being, looking not too dissimilar to ourselves. Their features are somehow more harsh and detailed. They looked down at me just as shocked. My mind exploded with realisation and panic and without thinking, as if controlled by something or someone else, I wave and say,

It was by my boyfriend. Who was an abusive bastard. I was suffering from some major stresses in life and wasn't sleeping. So the doctor gave me sleeping pills to help me sleep. One night I took them. And had a nightmare I was being raped but because of the drugs I couldn't move. I was frozen. The rapist put his hands around my throat as he raped me. 

I woke up in the morning upset by this dream. Only after seeing my boyfriend smirking did I ask what was up. He admitted he knew I had taken the sleeping pills and I'm completely out of it when I do. He thought it was funny and got angry with me when I told him that's fucked up and it's rape. 



The second time was with a person I thought was my friend. 

And honestly I'm angry not just at the guy. But everyone else's reaction. The wife immediately started saying I'm a husband stealer. That I broke up their marriage. 

When I was at home traumatized and just thinking what the fuck just happened, she was telling everyone I'm a whore who stole her husband. 

By the time I could even meet up with friends they had made up their opinions. They said I needed to live with my decisions and that it's my fault the marriage broke up. 

He fucking raped me !!! I was ostracized by my community and friends and never got the chance to tell my side!!!! 

I fell into a suicidal depression. I tried killing myself and almost got arrested. I decided to seek help. I got put on antidepressants and saw a therapist once a week for 4 years. 

Towards the 3 year mark. She suggested I try and open myself up again to friendship with males. Even dating. I was hesitant but she convinced me to give it a go. I started talking to a guy from work. He had a good sense of humour. 

One day he asked about going for coffee. I said yes. He said he would pick me up in his car because parking wasn't easy and it's easier to park one car than two. 

He proceeded to drive out into the middle of nowhere. No cell signal. No other cars around. When I tried to fight back he got angry. If I yelled he grabbed me. I immediately just stopped fighting and stopped talking. 

We were in the middle of nowhere, no signal, no cars. And it's like the places you see on the news where the body would be found 3 weeks later. 

So I just sat there and smiled and let him touch me all over. Eventually he got bored and drove me home. 

The police said because I didn't record the threats or anything it was my word against his and nothing would happen. 


I'm sick of people saying I need to date. 

I'm sick of realizing I can't afford property on my own unless I'm in a relationship. 

The thought of living my life completely on my own is so appealing ! 

And I'm still so betrayed by everyone who called me a whore and a wife stealer and wouldn't even let me explain my side of what happened. I was so re-traumatised by hearing that I need to accept the responsibilities of my actions and if I even tried to say 'but that's not what happened' I would get an eye roll. I couldn't even force the words 'he raped me' because my head was spinning so much that it even happened. 

I just want to rant. How dare my ""friends"" treat me that way. How could my bf do that to me?! 

One day I dream of having a home ! And I will do it without a man if it's the last thing I fucking do ! ",3,1733164712.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,0.8,False

It's a long and complicated story, but essentially we instantly became close and built an amazing friendship, all naturally and without trying.


We did everything together, we were totally inseparable at work and we'd chat in the evenings by message. We started hanging out together a couple of times a week and we just couldn't get enough of each other. 
She was in a long term relationship and I was single. She is also gay, so despite confusion from others and sometimes misleading signs from her, it was just a deep, pure friendship, nothing sexual or romantic. 


Suddenly her relationship started to fall apart (I'd seen it coming for months and had been a support to her without acknowledging it, I just tried to make her life easier, by taking her out more for peaceful coffee days, to get her away from all her stress for a while), they split and my friend was in a bad place. We talked every day and I went to visit her a few times, when she felt like it. We became even closer. I'd do anything for her, as she would for me.



Then one day it just ended, literally overnight. We'd been together one day and had plans for the weekend, when she just messaged me to say she's splitting her work and personal life. She didn't want to talk to me about anything outside of work anymore or spend time together. It ripped me apart and I spiralled into a bad state, I lost my best friend and so many future plans together overnight, all while still having to work together/cover for her whilst she was off work still.
The next time we met, she got really upset with how different it was and how she didn't like it being like normal colleagues now. 
Since then it's been a rollercoaster, one day she's nice, the next she's got zero time for me.
The real test was when she took vacation days recently, she just disappeared and wanted nothing to do with me. I tried to check in on her a few times, but she gave me short, late replies. 


I feel like it's over, the friendship has become a selfish, one sided deal. I know she's still got things going on with the breakup, but she's not being sensible there either, she won't take advice from anyone and is getting caught up with people that are just taking advantage of her.
I've lost my best friend and all our future plans, but still we have to work together. She expects work hours to be like they were before, us inseparable and doesn't like it when I'm quiet. However outside of work, she wants nothing to do with me. I can't handle that, I can't turn my emotions on and off like that. Tomorrow she wants to talk, after asking me why I'm so quiet at work again today. I have no idea what to say. I love her, she knows that, she also probably knows I'd love her romantically if we could too. I love her, but I can't continue with this rollercoaster. All I want is our friendship back to the way it was, not this one sided situation. What can I say to her?",2,1733164639.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False

Both of us have been working without major breaks, our financial situation is stable. We live in a Western European country. Generally speaking I’d describe him as more on the conservative side, but he’s not against me or women working.

He seems to dislike me going for work trips, doesn’t matter if it’s overnight or just staying longer at the office or generally coming home late. Once it slipped that he finds that my behaviour and accepting/attending those business events gives work priority over family. He is also not a big fan of me or me and our kid meeting other people for play dates/coffee dates. He is not a very social person and generally thinks low of other people. He wants to limit the views of society/government on our kid.

I do need social contacts. I do enjoy chats with coworkers or generally other people.

It’s not that he doesn’t allow me to go to work events or on business trips but his questions annoy me and make me uncomfortable. 

Questions such as - when will you be back- do you have a single room- with who will you go- do you need to go or do you want to go- how will you get there - why don’t you sleep at home- why don’t you leave early- 

When i return home he is not interested into learning how it went. He usually excuses himself by saying he’s tired and that he doesn’t want to talk. 
Talking about this with him leads to him saying that he thinks me attending those events/ trips are not necessary/valueble. And that he doesn’t actually have a problem with me going. 

Instagram psychologists would probably say it’s a power move that wants me to feel guilty. I don’t know. I just want to feel comfortable. Currently I’m always stressed when I’m out. Stressed that he will have bad mood (which he wouldn’t call bad) when i return or that i run later than i estimated.

I have had a messed up life up til now. Abusive father, abusive partners, EDs, addictions, mental illnesses, etc. I was in the deepest pit that i thought id never be able to climb out of.

Over the last year and a half, my life has gone nowhere but up. My meds have been working, ive been going to therapy, i cut off my dad, i stopped drinking and smoking and doing hallucinegenics, i get to spend most of my time at the love of my lifes house, im about to start a family with him, and I have so much love and support in my life from the people i care about most.

I feel so happy and lucky to be alive after everything ive been through. I have so much to be grateful for.

Even the smallest of things like my cats cuddling me, my coffee in the morning, the flowers on my table, the snow in my yard.. it all makes me happy. I no longer feel like im tethered down by an unbearable weight. I no longer feel lonely or lost.

I still have my days where it feels like all i can do is go to the bathroom and maybe feed myself once or twice. But i dont beat myself up for that anymore. I take the days as they come and do what i have energy for. I give myself grace and praise for the accomplishments i can achieve, even if its just getting out of bed for 5 minutes.

I'm 36. She's 33. She texted me every day, and we had video calls regularly. She said she wanted to be exclusive, I agreed. She told me her last boyfriend had cheated on her which caused the breakup. She said she missed me and that I was handsome sent me heart emojis, and drew a picture of me and my dog. She set aside a week for us to hang out and planned activities for us which she bought tickets for. She said she was looking forward to seeing me. 

For our first date we went to dinner at a restaurant. When I first saw her I told her how beautiful she looked. She brought me some gifts. I was showing her my phone and she saw I had the Bumble app and she asked why. I told her I wasn't using it anymore and I deleted it in front of her. She said I had long fingers and touch her hand to mine. She said I seemed sleepy, which I was from the time difference, so I said I would go to bed. Outside the restaurant she stopped and maybe she wanted me to kiss her but I didn't. She texted me afterwards saying I was handsome and I should smile more. 

The next day we met at a grocery store, bought some food and went to her apartment to make lunch. She saw I received a text. She asked if it was a co-worker texting me and I said it was. We watched a movie and she sat on a chair beside the couch. That evening we went to the park. I held her hand, but her hand was limp. I asked her if she liked holding hands and she asked me how long it had been since I had held another girl's hand, a month? I said a year. She brought sparklers which she lit and she took photos of us together and sent them to me. I commented on the photos that we were a good match and she agreed. 

I caught a cold during the flight and I wasn't sleeping well with the time difference. I was exhausted so I rested at my hotel on the 3rd day while she attended a business event. She sent me photos from the event.

On day 4 I brought breakfast to her place and then we went to a park, where I held her hand again we and went on a boat ride, where I put my arm around her. On day 5 I went to her place with flowers, which she said she liked very much. We went to a pottery class and a restaurant. 

On day 6 I visited her again and before we left to the zoo I asked if I could kiss her. She said she was afraid of catching my cold because she had a business trip soon, and said maybe tomorrow. On the drive to the zoo she said I seemed nervous because I was tapping my finger. I was a bit jittery from drinking coffee. She told me she had dumped a guy who visited her after she told him she was busy that day, because she felt he didn't respect her. She asked if I was dating other girls and I said no. 

On day 7 we went to an art gallery and a museum. We took a photo with an artist friend of hers. When I put my arm around her for the photo I had to stretch awkwardly which caused my arm to shake a bit. She said I seemed nervous again. 

On day 8 she came to my hotel. While we waited in the lobby for the taxi I pulled her closer to me with one hand, and I brushed her hair behind her ear with the other. She didn't react. In the taxi I put my hand on her knee, which she didn't react to either. She said her mom had bought me a gift and asked me to have lunch with her and her mom the next day to celebrate my birthday. I asked her why she didn't act romantic towards me and she said she didn't know why, that she wanted to give me a lot of love but that she wasn't sure she was falling in love, i'm a nice guy, gentle, but she couldn't help how she felt and that's why love is so difficult.

Later I asked her why her feelings for me changed and she said I it was because I wasn't confident. Initially I had taken things slow because I knew we had lots of time and I wanted to show that I was serious about her, which I was. She often texted me romantic things, but never anything sexual, so I thought she was a bit conservative or shy, so I didn't want to offend her by being too forward. When I did touch her she would never react. 

I've dated other girls and usually they respond positively to contact or give hints, or even initiate contact themselves, but she never did. I usually kiss by the second date, and the third is the longest I've waited before. So I don't know if it was really a lack of confidence on my part, or if she thought I was cheating on her or something else.",7,1733164217.0,dating_advice,3,0.9,False

Before I had left the window. It

Did not return with the kiss in the hall.

Our oldest has his own room and then the baby is in a room which is also the home office, as husband works full time from home. 

The baby is 15 months old, and is still having 2 naps a day, now on weekends when he naps in his room he will have an hour in a morning and 2 in the afternoon (give or take) 

However in the week he can’t nap in his room so I have to put him in our room in a travel cot and for whatever the reason he will not nap! He’ll made do 10 minutes on rare occasions an hour at max. It’s a really nightmare because he also becomes very difficult to deal with especially late afternoons. 

Onto of this everytime he comes down to make a drink both the kids see them then I have to deal with a full on felt down from the baby EVERYTIME his man makes a coffee! 

Now we don’t have a massive garden but we could easily get an office in there that would be big enough to be comfortable. But he refuses because he feels it’s “too far away” 🤦‍♀️


I’m 18 weeks pregnant and I feel like I can’t organise the the babies room properly & I’m tried, sick and having a couple hours every day would be amazing and really helpful for everyone in the house hold. 

I’ve tried everything I can think of to have the conversation expressed how much better it would be but he just says no. We definitely have the money for it, as the alternative thing is to convert our garage into an office space which is what he wants but 1. We have to get planning permission that can take up 6 months and 2. The work will take a lot longer as an office garden can be up in a week and doesn’t need planning permission. 

He’s also extremely stressed with his work, which again is another thing I told him not to do (as he doesn’t handle stress well & struggles to switch off form work) yet he decides to still start his own business & again it just feels like a decision he made against my advice and now we are stuck in a situation that I believe is negatively impacting both of us mentally.

I am leaning towards the T14, as I've read that the build quality is far superior to that of the E14. My main concern is the i5 vs AMD r5 processor and the difference in soldered RAM in the scenario that I want to upgrade the RAM. For context, I have an 8 year old, 8 GB RAM macbook pro that runs my codes just fine. So I think 16 GB would be enough. This ideally should last 3-4 years.

I quit cold turkey and haven’t looked back since the end of the first week. My reasons were solid and I was properly motivated, however one issue I’ve had that hasn’t gone away is that i think i’m constantly mildly constipated. 
I say “I think” because now i’m wondering if my frame of reference for this comes from a place of having near constant mild diarrhea from nicotine.
 
Before quitting, I would poop every day after my first smoke. And it’s literally the only thing that’s tempting me to break my streak right now. I feel like I poop different and I don’t go every day like i used to and today I just want to have half a cigarette so that i can have what i consider to be a normal bowel movement. I’ve tried eating more fiber, i’ve tried chia seeds and changing positions and coffee and oatmeal and cutting out dairy/processed meats/fried food. I’m afraid to try laxatives because I work all week and I’m not guaranteed a free stall while working and i don’t really wanna shit myself at work.

But, are they really? To me it seems that nobody is ever really THAT absorbed in their bubble (enough) to not miss out on a chance to gossip and judge and have a say in matters of other people's lives. Im not talking about this being the universal rule for everyone, but those obsessive nosy folks are rather proof that such claim is generally untrue. While yes, we do get caught up in our own experience, problems, POV, train of thought and whatnot, but judgement and opinions of others are literally fucking everywhere. Everyone is being judged whether they realise it or not. While doing a presentation at uni or while leaving a family gathering with relatives/coffee meeting with friends. Whether to themselves or to others, everyone is in some way commenting on something you expressed or how you dressed or what you have/haven't achieved in life so far. While talking on a first date, or during a job interview... judgement is fucking inevitable; it's part of life. So I just dont buy that ""don't overthink it, nobody caressss!!!"". They do care enough to point out all your missteps though.  It's unpleasant but its rather reality.

The cracked pavement of the streets became dirt roads as I carried on in the vague direction of where I remembered the bog to be. I had to wipe tears away from my eyes while I drove. They constantly welled up.

 

I looked over at my haul of weapons, looking so out of place on the seats of this cute little car. Heather’s parents, after much pestering, let me use their chainsaw once or twice when we would go help out on their farm; and I stole my grandpa’s hunting rifle many times. It had been a lot of years, but I felt just confident enough that I could at least fundamentally function them if I had to. But I still had no idea what was coming. As far as I knew I would be wading into hell itself.

 

I got to the old Lightbody Ranch, now decayed and completely overgrown. Like the earth was reclaiming it. Then I saw the wall of trees. The beginning of it at least. I got the car as close as it would go before I would worry about it sinking, and then I gathered my equipment and stepped out. Strapped the rifle to my back, and haphazardly stuffed the chainsaw and other tools into a backpack I had sitting in the back seat; the blade sticking awkwardly out from the top.

 

The fog was denser than any I’d ever seen. Beneath it, countless tall slender spires all bunched together. It didn’t take long for the old familiar smell of perfume and death to penetrate my nostrils. Similar to how the town smelled now, but so much stronger. The ground beneath my feet began to squelch instantly, like the bog had expanded.

 

I had no idea where I was going… There was no way for me to know… I just went forward. I could barely even see the ground anymore. Just grey among black.

 

A tree came into view. A tree, with an old ribbon tied around it. Suddenly I was reminded of how scared I was last time, and that fear began to creep into me now. I was hoping to block it out with adrenaline and my single-minded dedication to finding my best friend, but it got in. I was terrified. A million times more since I didn’t have Em with me.

 

I began seeing shapes in the fog, just like last time. Figures slipping in and out of view. Only the faintest shapes. The cross shapes. They reminded me of everyone I just saw staring at me in town. It gave me the same dread. I was more alone in this place than I had ever been before, but I did not feel alone. I felt watched.

 

Wading through the vast sinking mud was hard enough without all this shit strapped to my back. Now it was truly nightmarish. I fell over many times. Nearby got stuck for good on multiple occasions. That sensation of hands grabbing me and pulling me down into the mud was consistent. It felt like dozens of hands now.

 

I trudged through the unforgiving and deathly cold marsh for hours. Lost all feeling in my toes. Finally I found my way to some solid ground. I collapsed on it and allowed my body to begin producing breath at a normal rate again. My muscles ached and throbbed, I tried wiggling my toes and after a few minutes I was able to. Eventually I looked up, expecting to see that giant hawthorn tree we saw last time, but it wasn’t there. This was a different place. I don’t know why, but I had a feeling I needed to find that tree again. But how?

 

I did see the symbols though. Those inverted triangles with the line through the bottom. “Earth” and I suppose that made sense now. They were carved into so many more trees.

 

All I could do was keep moving forward as consistently as I could despite the constant disorientation of the fog. I tried my best. I walked and I walked in what I thought was a straight line, only I began seeing things repeat. The same stump, the same tree, the same flowers. I went in a circle. The figures kept appearing in the distance. The crosses. It felt like they got closer every time I’d see them. Every time I saw them, it became clearer what they were. Even though I knew already.

 

I tried taking a different path, but it didn’t yield better results. The scarecrows inched closer and closer, while never appearing to move. Then I stepped on something. I nearly rolled my ankle. Instinctively I looked down and it looked like a small die at first, but it was a bead. A letter bead, from Em’s friendship bracelet. The letter ‘A’, either from ‘Lila’ or ‘Heather.’

 

I scanned the ground looking for more and amidst the fog I was able to see the faintest glimmer of white in the dark browns and greens and greys. I walked over and picked up an ‘L.’ She must have been leaving these like breadcrumbs. I saw another in the same direction. Now I finally had a path.

 

Another ‘L’, then a few meters away, an ‘H’. The flora got denser as I progressed, and the scarecrows crept closer, but never close enough that I could see their faces. Every now and then I’d hear the distant sound of a twig snapping. I had to try really hard not to scream.

 

I continued on and found a clearing. I didn’t see any letters at first, but I looked up and… There it was. The hawthorn tree. I finally made it back here, the long way.

 

My mind was cast back to the first time we reached the tree. Em said she saw something. She said something was wrong with it. I didn’t really see it… I thought I might have, but I wasn’t sure… Now though, there was nothing wrong with it. To me it was just a tree. I got close this time. I looked hard into the mess of leaves and branches but… Nothing. All I could see was another letter dropped near the base. I walked over and snatched up an ‘E’.

 

Was that it? I wondered. Is the tree somehow the destination? I looked all around the roots, looking to see if maybe there was a hatch or something. A hidden entrance to some kind of underground… I don’t even know what. But I saw nothing, so I went back to scanning the area.

 

Sure enough, another letter past the tree. Maybe the tree wasn’t important after all. Maybe it was just a kind of landmark, I thought. I carried on and picked up an ‘A’. I felt like I was getting close. Wherever I was going, it couldn’t be far from the hawthorn tree.

 

As I moved forward, picking up another ‘L’, I noticed the fog dissipate in front of me to reveal an enormous natural wall of rock and vines. It stretched on for all I could see, and I couldn’t see the top of it. Some kind of vast fault creating a massive cliffside. I scanned it over and over, hoping to figure out what I’m supposed to do now. No obvious entrance to anything, certainly no way to climb it, so I cast my eyes down once again, hoping the letters would guide me.

 

A few meters away, I didn’t see one letter as I expected; I saw all the remaining letters, dropped in a pile at the foot of the cliff. This was the end of the line.

 

I didn’t understand, there was nothing here. Just a cascade of earth and rock like the rest of the wall. But then I looked harder. Behind this one thicket of vines and roots, there was the tiniest gap between the rocks. This little area was camouflaged.

 

I thought about using the chainsaw, but I didn’t want to draw attention. Not just yet. I reached my hand in and pulled at the vines. They were very stubborn. I tore and I ripped, eventually making some headway and I could see there was indeed an entrance to something behind here. Thin, impossible to find. I wouldn’t have seen it in a million years if the beads weren’t laid out right at the foot of it.

 

That wasn’t the only thing I found. As I pulled my hand back from the mess of vines, it was covered in blood. Rich, dark, crimson blood. The vines bled as I ripped them. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, but I had no time to think about it. I had to get in there.

 

As I stuck more of my body inside, forcing my way through the vines and squeezing between the rocks, I noticed that the rock on my right side could move. I pushed and it slid open with minimal resistance. Then I got my whole body inside. I couldn’t believe it. I made it. I found something no one had been able to find in decades. I was here. I could find Em.

 

I instantly could tell what this place was, or at least what it used to be. I could see by the long cavernous hallways, the hanging overhead lights, and the wooden support beams. At some point in history, this was a mine. I pulled out the rifle and got it ready. I was in the mouth of hell now.

 

This place was wrong. The fog wasn’t inside but the feeling of it was. A million invisible tiny particles floating by, dancing off my skin, being breathed in through my nostrils. My heart rate was already elevated but now I could feel it all through my body, I could hear it deep in my brain. Thudding, pulsating, low droning booms making my temples flex, reverberating throughout every inch of me. My vision got narrower as I walked inside, the edges turned to static and bright flashing storms of colour that weren’t really there. It felt like a migraine. Was it the cocktail of adrenaline, anxiety, and physical exertion causing my body to shut down; or was it this place?

 

The long hallway broke off into many rooms. Each one crudely labeled in smudged and faded sharpie on basic paper stickers now yellowed and decayed. Some labels overwritten multiple times. I knew I had to check all of these rooms, as much as I didn’t want to know what lay inside.

 

The first doorway on the left read “Admissions.” I led with the gun and walked inside. Just a few empty cots. There was a clipboard on the wall with a list of names, ages, and eye color. I didn’t want to took at it too closely, but the most recent name was Emily Knowby. I rushed out and moved to the room on the right.

 

“Garden.” This room was unusually sanitary and sterile. Akin to a makeshift college science lab. Full of multiple glass cases with soil and various plants, and little water spritzers above them. I didn’t want to take too much time but I had to look a little closer. Some of the plants inside looked strange. They looked squishy, veiny, some had little tufts of hair. Most of the plants in the soil weren’t actually plants. Just little wet mounds of mulch and… blood. Some had more than that. Some looked more fleshy. I think there might have been a tooth in one of them. I wanted to wretch. I couldn’t fathom what those were. I didn’t want to know. I moved on.

 

The next room on the left read “Gynoecium.” I didn’t know what that word meant. Inside looked like another thrown together lab. There were test tubes and beakers, and more specimens behind glass. These specimens looked bizarre. Like oversized seed pods, but they were bleeding. Seeping red, like the vines. My mind couldn’t comprehend it.

 

I really didn’t want to keep going. My legs were made of lead. It took every ounce of willpower to move them forward. A sense of ultimate dread filling my entire being as I neared the next room. I wiped the tears from my eyes and read the words on the label. I wish I hadn’t. I didn’t think it could get worse, but it just did.

 

I tried to un-know the words. I begged myself, I begged the universe, I begged gods I didn’t even believe in for the chance to un-know those words. But there they were. “Maternity Ward.”

 

I glanced inside… It was everything I was afraid of and so much worse. The sound that escaped my mouth was not of my own volition. A row of cots, most of them full. Oxygen masks on their faces. Various tubes hooked up to various places on their bodies. Their bellies…

 

I couldn’t see their eyes. Thank god I couldn’t see their eyes. None of them moved. They must have heard me but none of them acknowledged me. They were frail, ghastly, their arms were practically bones. They didn’t even look remotely alive, but they were breathing. All of their skin was pale and grey, with squiggled red, blue, and green veins all over… Those piles of fleshy mulch I saw, was that the product of this? I collapsed to my knees and frantically covered my mouth because I had to scream. Over and over.

 

One final impulse ripped through my head. One final command that cut through all the horror I was facing. “Get Em. Get out.” I leapt to my feet and stormed onwards. Only a few rooms left. I didn’t look at the labels, and I blocked out the contents inside. I was reduced to base instinct alone. I took in no information other than “Is Em in here?” All I know is I saw bodies, and I saw flowers, and I didn’t see Em.

 

I passed two more rooms, but as I looked into the third, my tunnel vision broke. I saw her. I found her. She was laying on another of those cold metal tables. Our eyes met. She looked so tired.

 

“Lila?” She uttered weakly.

 

I almost walked right in before I noticed the two men standing over her… One I knew instantly. Dom. So much anger surged through me, so much hate, so much pain; but not enough to take away from the shock of the other face… I’ve seen his face before. I’ve seen it numerous times in news articles, all my life. Was it actually him? It couldn’t possibly be, but here he was. I was staring into the eyes of Darren Barbeau.

 

A look of shock covered their faces, but after a moment Darren smiled. “My little flower.” He muttered in a deeply inhuman and hollow voice. I couldn’t let the shock get the better of me. I couldn’t freeze. I couldn’t allow myself to break. My final impulse took over once again. I raised the rifle, pointed it at his head, and shot.

 

His head tore apart like confetti, exploding into a firework of gore. A sea of crimson with streaks of yellow-y green phlegm painted the wall behind him. His body collapsed to the ground. Dom lunged towards me and I shot again, getting him in the throat. He went down instantly, gurgling and choking on his own blood. He tried to speak, but couldn’t. Good. I had no desire to hear what he had to say. Why and how he became a part of this, for how long, what he did to Heather and why he chose her... I decided his death was more important than those answers. So they would die writhing in pain alongside him.

 

I grabbed Em. Her body was weak and she wasn’t able to put any weight behind her movements, so I swung her arm around my neck and pulled her to her feet.

 

I walked her briskly out of the room, but when I turned to head back down the long hallway, I was face to face with the scarecrows. Almost a dozen of them, blocking my path. Their arms weren’t outstretched anymore, and I could clearly see their faces now. Flesh, patched into burlap, formed into a misshapen sack of a head. Some had parts of actual faces. Others just had generic smiley faces stitched on. Some were more sophisticated looking than others. Some almost looked completely human.

 

I looked to the adjacent room. It read “Black Eyed Susan.” I REALLY didn’t want to know what was in there, but we had no choice. I moved Em and myself inside, walking us backwards.

 

I looked to the doorway, letting go of Em and raising the rifle towards it. Waiting for them to approach. But they didn’t. I don’t think they were aware enough to attack. They just moved, and watched, and waited.

 

I almost felt relief when they didn’t approach, until Em screamed the most horrific scream I’d ever heard. I turned around and saw her looking behind us into the room. I didn’t want to look, but I did.

 

Rows of chairs on opposite sides of the room, all filled. More people, unmoving, with tubes running in and out of their bodies, except these ones were very different. There were so many more tubes, all pumping in liquids of various colours and consistencies. It also didn’t take long to realize these people were not human. Not all the way. Their flesh was patchy and incomplete, and they also had some kind of film all over it. Almost like a translucent cobweb or something. Their faces were wrong in every conceivable way. These were the scarecrows. This is where they grow. This is where they imbibe.

 

They look more advanced than some of the ones I glanced at in the hallway. They’re getting better, they’re getting closer to the real thing. They just have trouble with the faces. I had a feeling these were the products of the maternity ward. The ones that worked. These were his hybrids.

 

That wasn’t the worst part. The worst part was what all the tubes led to. At the back of the room. It all fed into one more… body. I hesitate to refer to it as a body. Sure it had arms and legs and a torso, a feminine form, but… The head.

 

Maybe at one point it was a human head. But whatever had been done to it made it impossible to see as such. I couldn’t help but move closer to try and discern what I was looking at… I knew this was Black Eyed Susan. Not the man. Not Darren Barbeau. This was what it was all for. This was the catalyst. This was what made all his delusion into reality.

 

Its head, from a distance, looked like the head of an actual black eyed susan flower or a sunflower. Colourful petals all spread out in every direction from the black center. Looking closer… The petals were skin. The face was carved into pie slices, peeled back, and hung on wires to mimic the petals. Beneath the petals… The place where you’d find the sunflower seeds… Eyes. Dozens of human eyes. Every eye from every victim. And I could see the pupils dilating as I got closer.

 

Everything that Darren Barbeau “learned” from the eyes of his victims, the secret of life, now rests inside her. And it’s being pumped into all these “people” and god knows what else.

 

“No. No no no. Oh god. It can’t be.” Em began to cry uncontrollably. I thought it was just because of the horrific sight before her… But it was worse than that. So, so much worse. It took me a minute to notice what she noticed. I almost wish I didn’t. On her left wrist… A friendship bracelet.

 

I fell numb. This was too much to process. Too far beyond my comprehension. Em collapsed, crying and screaming until her voice went hoarse. I wept silently and unmoving. I didn’t have any more breakdowns left in me. I was broken. My heart, my spirit, my will, all of it gone to dust in an instant.

 

I put the rifle down and took off my backpack, setting it on the ground and pulling out the chainsaw.

 

It took two pulls of the cord for it to turn on. It was loud but I didn’t hear anything now. I just stared. Stared into the dozens of eyes and they all stared back at me.

 

“I love you, Heather.”

 

I raised the saw above my head, then plunged it into the mess of eyes. They popped and squirted and shredded like plump grapes. Pouring and spraying and oozing all over the room, liquids of every colour. I couldn’t stop. I carved and I carved. I severed every cord. I turned the head to mush. I couldn’t let a single eye remain. The eyes that fell to the ground intact, I squished under my shoe.

 

The rotting perfume scent intensified and overwhelmed my senses, I could see it in the air escaping from the holes I carved. It looked like glitter. The colour storm on the edges of my vision crept in and enveloped me. The dark cavernous walls began to pulsate with vivid scarlet and cerulean hues. My focus pushed and pulled. Every motion created a colourful haze in its wake. The room spun and my legs fell out from under me. I turned my body and reached for Em but she looked a mile away.

 

I looked up and the ceiling melted away into a void more vast than anything I had ever experienced. The glitter floated into the void and shimmered like stars. The colours wove in and out of those stars. Beautiful deep blues, vibrant purples, and cosmic greens lit up the void. So impossibly big, and I felt so impossibly small. All sound cut out. Only the slow, thumping heartbeat in my ears remained.

 

The universe was showing itself to me, and it was beautiful and horrible. I laid there gazing for what felt like a lifetime, into the endless cascade. I felt trapped in my own body, all I wanted to do was reach out and join the stars; but a shape formed in front of me, blocking my view. I heard external sounds and felt vague, fuzzy sensations across my face. I didn’t want to leave this place, but it all came into focus. The shape became a face and I recognized it. The sounds became words and I recognized them.

 

“Lila! We have to go, now!” Em’s voice said, sounding 100 feet away. I remembered by purpose. My eyes focused on her face and I came back to earth. The ceiling returned but the colours didn’t stop.

 

The first thing I saw after Em’s horrified face, were the people sitting in the chairs. They weren’t sitting motionless anymore. They were shaking violently. Uncontrollably. Em tried to pull me up but she was still weak. I made it to a knee.

 

I heard a pop, and I turned my gaze towards it. One of the shaking people now had a bright oozing hole in their shoulder. Another pop and I saw something on their body quickly pustulate and burst a six-inch hole into their abdomen. I heard more cracking and popping behind me, along with violent inhuman screams. Two more pops. One on the kneecap and the entire leg burst off. One on the face taking half of the head with it. Vines and tendrils began creeping out of the holes, wiggling and writhing.

 

Another body caught my attention. Its eyes began to bulge unnaturally. Pushing violently out of its skull. It screamed. Then hard, barbed tree branches shoved the eyes all the way out and hooked downwards. Two more branches came out of the ears, and a final one emerged from the mouth. It looked like a barbed, wooden hand. The tree-like hand then clenched around the face it had emerged from and began pulling it inward. Like sticking your hand through a sweater sleeve and pulling it inside out. What happened to the body as this occurred… I can’t begin to describe, but I vomited.

 

Sharp green needles protruded from another one’s mouth, pushing out and replacing its teeth. Its lips ripped open to create a mouth three times as wide. The top half of the head snapped back 90 degrees. I geyser of red and milky green followed.

 

Vines and branches ripped through another’s abdomen so sharply and violently that the entire bottom half of their body was severed. Another had spider-like branches protrude from the sides of their ribcage underneath their arms, then clasp around their torso and rip it open like a Christmas present.

 

I could only guess that without Black Eyed Susan, the hybridization became unstable and was violently rejected. They were all being viciously torn to shreds by the atrocity of their own biology. And yet, through it all, they refused to die.

 

Bones cracked and popped, flesh tore and burst, a chaotic mess of serpentine protrusions flailed in every direction. The room spun. The deep scarlet haze; the pulsating walls in rhythm with my throbbing temples; the cacophony of pained, inhuman screams; I couldn’t imagine hell looking any other way.

 

Em pushed me to leave, but I had to do something. I couldn’t leave it like this. They needed to die, and this place needed to die. I gave Em the saw, and I reached into my bag for the spray can and the lighter. If anything can kill them, it would be fire.

 

I didn’t waste another second. They all lit up easy. Their grotesque, mutilated bodies shook and screamed in the wall of orange flame. The writhing severed pieces inched towards me in whatever way they could, but they went up too. Em and I ran to the door. The scarecrows in the hallway began to jitter and ooze fluid. I sought to put an end to all of them when I was grabbed and tackled by the headless body of Darren Barbeau. Of course he lived. Of course he wasn’t human either.

 

He held me down and clawed at my face. The hole in his neck began to bubble and expand. I could see something being savagely forced through it. Birthed from it. Violently and painfully. As it squeezed its way through, I could see it was another head. A primitive, undercooked attempt at a head. No skin, no lips, no eyes, no eyelids, just muscle tissue over wooden skull, with branches and barbs protruding from almost every inch.

 

It stuck its fingers in my mouth and pulled at my jaw. I tried to bite down but the force was too strong and I felt a pop as it began to dislodge. I didn’t feel pain so much as intense discomfort and panic as a part of my body wasn’t where it was supposed to be. I looked into the cavernous black eye holes on the messy bleeding skull.

 

It tried to speak, but before it could figure out how to articulate words, the chainsaw came ramming through it, then shot upwards, cutting it up the middle leaving both halves splayed apart. The various multicoloured liquids drenched by face. I shoved him off of me and spat his fingers out of my mouth, while his body spasmed and flailed like the others.

 

One of the scarecrows grabbed Em as I was getting back to my feet. This wasn’t just any scarecrow, though. It looked closer to human than any of the others and… The clothes… The long mess of bright orange hair… This scarecrow was made to look like Heather. And it did. It looked so much like her, except for the face which was just another burlap smiley face stitched on. My heart couldn’t break any more. I was livid. This mockery of our best friend. The desecration. The way it tricked us into all of this, this entire trip. I couldn’t stand it.

 

I pushed it back and lit it up. It stumbled backwards into the others, and they collapsed in an inferno. They didn’t have the basic survival instincts to run away from the flames, they just burned. Barbeau stirred. His hand began to reach out, but he too was caught in the blaze. We only had a few seconds to move past them before the entire hallway was lit up. I pushed Em forward and then I had to make a leap. My pant leg was singed but I made it. Maybe all the caked on mud helped.

 

We stumbled quickly towards the exit, trying to outrun the smoke and flames, but I stopped at the maternity ward. I wanted so badly to be able to do something, but they were so far beyond my or anyone’s help. They were corpses. All I could hope for was that the smoke would get through the oxygen masks and take them quickly before the fire did, and their suffering would end. Em pulled me away and we continued on. The flames spread slowly across the vines and leaves that were strewn along the ceiling and walls. The smoke spread so much faster.

 

Our pace quickened as our lungs constricted. I expected to hear more screams as the fire spread but… I didn’t. We ran through the vines at the end of the tunnel and fell out onto the grass. Immediately we could breathe again. Still coughing, almost passing out, but we made it. We were free. The nightmare that had plagued us for decades was at an end.

 

Em and I slowly caught our breath and rose back to our feet. I looked at her and she looked at me. Then she lunged towards me, wrapping her arms around me tight. I just got my breath back, but it was taken out again. This time I was okay with it. She sobbed into my chest; I could feel her tears soaking into my shirt. I wrapped my arms around her too. I couldn’t think of anything to say, and I don’t think she could either.

 

We slowly made our way back; I saw the Hawthorn tree in the near distance. Sunlight began to beam over the horizon and the fog appeared to be thinning. The pain in my jaw began to rear its head, but I managed to kind of pop it back into place temporarily. It hurt a lot.

 

The horrors of this night seemed to be over… Except… As we got closer to the Hawthorn tree, something didn’t look right.

 

We both saw it as we got closer. Something was wrong. Something was so wrong. Em recognized it from last time. The tree looked… Wet. But it hadn’t rained. Then the tree started warping. Moving. Pulsating. It wasn’t just my vision distorting this time. As we got closer, the wetness became more clear. It was blood.

 

The tree was bleeding, and it was breathing. The blood soaked into the ground beneath it, softening it. Now even the ground began to breathe, and we began to sink.

 

I felt hands pulling me down once again except now… I could see them. There really were hands. They were everywhere. Hands, and other pieces of bodies. Not solid, but solid enough. The disposed remnants of failed experiments. Liquifying in their own endlessly pumping blood. Still alive. There was no bog. They were the bog. Em managed to find a stable piece of ground, but my legs were caught. I was going down. It was past my shins.

 

The bark of the tree looked moist and fleshy and it began to open. A big 7 foot tall vertical slit formed in the center of the tree. The sides curled outwards, and beneath it was a wall of bleeding flesh. Beneath that wall, a hand pressed against it. Then another hand. Then another. I saw what this was. I saw it inside the mine. This was the gynoecium. If the maternity ward produced those scarecrows, what did this produce?

 

I sank up to my thighs now. The hands reached and tugged at my arms and torso. Em tried but she couldn’t get to me. One of the hands within the tree pushed through. Steam rose into the sky, and a body began to climb out. The body was hairless, shiny, and coated in some king of translucent slime. But the face was unmistakable. Darren Barbeau.

 

As his torso rose over the threshold, it didn’t give way to a bottom half. The flesh continued into a big mound. More arms and legs sprouted from the mound. A dozen or more. More heads. More bodies. All molted together. A big tangled spider web of parts, but even the parts weren’t right. I saw a mouth on one of the feet. I saw an ear in the middle of a torso. I saw eyes coming out of a shoulder. Everything was wrong. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be. Killing Black Eyed Susan sent everything into madness.

 

I was unable to look away from the grotesque sight before me, but then I heard the chainsaw. Em started it, and was carving through the mud around me. Shredding hands and tendrils to pieces. I saw teeth and parts of bones flying all over. The sinking eased up and I was able to climb a few inches.

 

The mess of limbs, bodies, and heads stumbled out of the curtains of bleeding flesh without end. With every movement it made, it revealed more. Em screamed. Not a scream of terror this time, but a scream of rage and desperation. She ran towards it with the chainsaw in hand. I continued to slowly pull myself out of the mire.

 

All I could see were pieces flying, and the now familiar sight of waves of red and spurts of pale green ooze spraying and popping and exploding. It rained upon me. Every single mouth on the abomination was screaming, but Em didn’t stop.

 

I managed to pull myself completely out, and I ran over to Em. I grabbed her from behind and pulled her back, then turned to face the creature myself. Or what was left of it. Now just a quivering pile of bloody pieces.

 

A mouth in the middle of a stomach began to open, looking like it was trying to speak.

 

“Little-“

 

I flicked the lighter and sprayed a ball of fire into it. The pile lit up and screamed. Then I sprayed all around the tree. It took time. It pulsated and it oozed more and more blood, but it went up. I saw the hands in the mud violently shake and fall apart.

 

We staggered back and watched as it burned. Both of us were coated head to toe in all sorts of putrid mess. Smoke filled the sky, but the fog faded, and the sun was fully shining. It was finally over. I reached for her hand and she held it once more.

 

We waded through the forest and the marsh, no longer feeling the pull of the liquid flesh, and came out on the other side alive. We found Em’s car right where I parked it and we left.

 

There wasn’t a lot of conversation as we made our way back into town. We were both just too tired. Our sanity had been stretched beyond its limit and we had no idea how to process it.

 

We stopped at the motel, and I had the best shower of my life. We got changed, trashed our old clothes, and hit the road. I thought about staying at the motel. Resting a while. But we needed to get out of this place.

 

Em decided to go see her father again before she left. I was very hesitant, but he seemed to be doing better. Everyone did. The fog was gone. He didn’t appear to recall anything of our interaction last night, nor did he care to bring up anything else from the day before. They parted ways amicably. Em kept it together well.

 

We left the town and a massive weight lifted from my chest. We were on our way home. Eventually, Em broke the long incredulous silence.

 

“I’m sorry, Lie. I’m so sorry I dragged you into all this.”

 

“No.” I interrupted, but Em continued on.

 

“It was so selfish after all these years to make you come up here. To bring you into all my sh… problems. I almost got you killed! Or worse! I don’t even know…”

 

“You couldn’t have known. How the hell would you have ever known? It wasn’t on you. Don’t do that.”

 

“I can’t… I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s all that’s in my head.” I could hear Em about to break down. I wasn’t far off either.

 

“I know. I can’t either. Let’s just… not talk about it right now, okay? We only have a few hours left together and…”

 

“You’re right. I don’t want this to be how we… end things.”

 

“Yeah…” I responded, solemnly. I realized I really didn’t want this to end.

 

“Lie?” Em asked.

 

“Yeah?”

 

“Can we do your playlist? I just feel like mine is a bit much right now.”

 

I laughed for the first time since this all started. Things weren’t back to normal… I don’t think they would ever be… But we could be okay, just for right now.

 

She continued, “And, before we stop talking about it… Just… Thank you for saving me.”

 

It was a long trip back, but it didn’t feel long. All the things weighing on our minds made time pass quickly, even though we tried not to think about it. There was no shut eye, we didn’t even bother trying.

 

Before I knew it, Em pulled up to my building. We both got out, I gathered my bags, and we stood on the sidewalk. Neither of us felt ready to leave the other. Especially me. So, I persuaded her to come up to my apartment and have a coffee for the road.

 

I knew my place looked like shit, but I also knew Em never cared about all that. She spent lots of time in my shitty place as a kid. More importantly, after everything we went through… Who cares? It was difficult to care about anything anymore. I made her the coffee… There was still so much to say but I didn’t know how to say it.

 

“How long am I allowed to park out front there?” Em asked.

 

“Oh… Uh… You’re not.”

 

“What? Shoot! Lila!”

 

“I’m sorry! I didn’t think about that. You’re probably fine though. If you hurry, you’ll be fine.”

 

“Good lord, okay… Okay I guess I should go.”

 

A silence hung in the air for a moment.

 

“Yeah… You probably should.” I responded. I really didn’t want her to go. I didn’t want to be alone, and I didn’t want to be without her.

 

“Okay… You’ll come over or something soon, right?” Em asked, hopefully.

 

“I will. We’ll… We’ll make it work.”

 

“Good…” Em started making her way towards the door. “Thank you… For everything. I’m gonna miss you.”

 

“Yeah I’m gonna miss you too… Get home safe and everything, Em…” I uttered, awkwardly. Trying not to let the sadness or desperation show.

 

Em smiled a half smile and opened the door.

 

“I-“ The word escaped from my mouth, but I cut myself off before finishing the sentence. Em let go of the door and turned back to me.

 

“I don’t… want you to go.” I muttered. She looked at me silently, expecting to hear more. So I had to say more, even if I couldn’t form the thoughts correctly. Even if I might say too much.

 

“I need to say… I never told you… There’s so many things, and so many times I wanted to but I… I was afraid of things changing. I was afraid you wouldn’t…” I was stammering and stumbling. I couldn’t believe after all this, I still couldn’t just come out and say it. “I just don’t want to be apart. I don’t want to be alone. Especially after all this shit. And I… I can’t let you go without telling you, because I almost lost you and I just can’t-”

 

Em closed the distance between us, and without saying a word she leaned in and kissed me. I didn’t think my heart could take any more surprises, but this last one I welcomed. Pain shot through my dislocated jaw and I couldn’t have cared less. When she pulled away, she had tears in her eyes. I could feel them on my face. She must have seen how flustered I was because she laughed a little through the still flowing tears and caressed my cheek.

 

“Me too.”

 

So the trip didn’t end. I decided to get back in her car and we drove all the way to her place. I ended up staying for two weeks... What happened during those two weeks is ours to keep, and ours alone.

 

We talked to Em’s dad over the phone. Didn’t tell him about any of that, but he did tell us some things. The odd behavior in Willow Bay and some other surrounding areas did not go unnoticed. Tests were done and there was determined to be what they called some sort of bio weapon unleashed. An “aerosolized hallucinogenic drug” as they called it. Making everyone who breathed in enough of it prone to suggestion and vivid hallucinations.

 

I went back and forth about that. Certainly, that’s what happened to the town. That’s what hid in the fog. I figured that much already. But how far did that drug go? I would love to believe that everything I experienced that night was merely the product of excessive hypnotic drugs. The worst trip of all time. Then the earth I live in would make a lot more sense. I knew the bog was real. I knew the mine was real. I even knew the experiments were real. But the monsters… the scarecrows… the flesh… It would make sense if they weren’t real. I was expecting to see them, so I saw them. Classic hypnosis. But, every time I take a bite of food and my jaw clicks, I can’t help but doubt. It would be too easy.

 

I’m with Em again now. Its been four more weeks and I just moved the last of my stuff in. We’re doing well. We have nightmares almost every night, and crying fits every few days, but having eachother to hold on to makes it all bearable…

 

So that’s the story of Black Eyed Susan. Of Darren Barbeau. Of the untold and unthinkable horrors lurking in the dark. Beyond the edge of perception, comprehension, and sanity. Mine’s just one tale, of one little corner of the world. You might not know it, but your corner might have a monster in it too. Stay safe, everyone. Tell the people you love that you love them. I have to get back to Em now, we're planning a trip to somewhere cold. We might not end up going though, she’s been nauseous these past few days. So we’ll see.",2,1733163796.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I was at some sort of work appreciation/training event that had guest speakers. So just a medium sized room with a bunch of office people sitting in metal fold-out chairs. 

Taylor Swift enters and just kinda wanders over and gets coffee. No one really pays any mind. Now I'm certainly no swiftie and it's probably been months since I've actually heard one of her songs so I thought that was unusual that she show up in my dream.

I'm sitting there chatting with my co-worker while we wait for the meeting to start and I take off my glasses to clean them. Taylor, suddenly standing next to me where I'm sitting for some reason, proceeds to take them from me and polish them herself with her shirt hem and hands them back. I, somewhat confused by this, say thanks and she smiles and walks away. 

We continue waiting for other speakers and Kevin James, dressed as a pirate, shows up. I'm again rather confused by this as it's probably been years since I've seen him in anything. He walks over to the side and waits as well. 

I'm looking at my watch, wondering when the meeting will start, and finally the last speaker shows up. Gale, from BG3, which i have played within the last few months and browse subs for it, so that one makes more sense.

Looking for a sleek and silent mouse to complement your workspace? I recently got my hands on the Logitech Pebble, and I'm impressed with its modern design and quiet performance.

This slim wireless mouse fits easily in my bag, making it perfect for on-the-go use. I love how it connects via Bluetooth or the included USB receiver, giving me flexibility in how I use it. The off-white color adds a clean, minimalist touch to my desk setup.

I'm amazed at how quiet this mouse is. The clicks and scrolling are nearly silent, which is great for shared spaces or late-night work sessions. The battery life is impressive too - I haven't had to change it in months.

One thing to note is that while the mouse is comfortable, its small size might not suit everyone. It works well for my average-sized hands, but those with larger hands might find it a bit small for long-term use.

# Bottom Line

The Logitech Pebble is a great pick for anyone wanting a quiet, portable mouse with a modern look. It's been a reliable companion for my work and travel needs.



# Logitech Pebble M350 Overview

I recently got my hands on the Pebble M350, and I'm impressed. This slim mouse fits easily in my bag and feels great to use. It's super quiet - I can click and scroll without bothering anyone nearby. The battery lasts a long time too. I like that I can connect it with Bluetooth or the USB receiver.

The Pebble works well on different surfaces and tracks accurately. It's compatible with lots of devices, from Windows laptops to iPads. The simple design looks good on my desk. While it's comfortable for everyday use, it might be too small for some people with larger hands.

Overall, the Pebble M350 is a solid choice if you want a portable, quiet mouse that looks nice and gets the job done.

# Minimalist Design

The Pebble's sleek shape caught my eye right away. Its slim profile and smooth curves make it a standout on any desk. I love how it feels in my hand - light and comfortable for long use. The off-white color gives it a clean, modern look that blends well with my workspace. It's so compact, I can easily slip it in my bag when I'm on the go. The simple two-button layout with a scroll wheel keeps things uncluttered. There are no unnecessary frills or buttons to clutter up the design. It's a mouse that looks good and works well without drawing attention to itself. The minimalist aesthetic is perfect for those who want a stylish yet functional accessory for their computer setup.

# Quiet Click Technology

I was impressed by how silent this mouse is. The clicks are barely audible, making it great for use in quiet spaces like libraries or shared offices. Even the scrolling is whisper-quiet. This feature really stands out compared to standard mice that can be quite noisy. The Pebble's quiet operation doesn't sacrifice performance though - clicks still feel responsive and precise. It's a small but meaningful upgrade that makes using the mouse more pleasant, especially for long work sessions. The silent clicks are so subtle that at first I had to double-check the mouse was actually working!

# Versatile Connectivity

I was impressed by the Pebble's connectivity options. It pairs via Bluetooth or with the included USB receiver. This lets me use it with my laptop, tablet, and even my phone. Switching between devices is easy. I like that I can leave the tiny USB receiver plugged into my desktop and still use Bluetooth with my iPad. The mouse works well with Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, and more. Its broad compatibility is great for my mix of devices. The wireless range is solid too - I can control my TV-connected PC from across the room. While not rechargeable, the battery lasts a long time.

# Battery Life

I was pleasantly surprised by the Pebble's battery performance. This little mouse runs on a single AA battery, which comes included in the package. Logitech claims it lasts up to 18 months, and from my experience, that seems realistic. I've been using it daily for work and haven't needed to replace the battery yet. The mouse also has an auto-sleep feature that helps conserve power when it's not in use. One thing to note - there's no battery indicator, so you'll need to keep a spare handy just in case. Overall, the long battery life means I don't have to worry about frequent replacements or recharging, which is a big plus for me.

# Optical Tracking Precision

The Pebble's optical sensor works great. I found it tracks smoothly on most surfaces, even on my glass desk. With 1000 DPI sensitivity, it's precise enough for everyday tasks. I had no issues moving the cursor exactly where I wanted. The mouse glides easily, making small movements feel natural. It's not a gaming mouse, but for office work and web browsing, the tracking is spot-on. I like that it works well on different textures - from mousepads to wood to fabric. The sensor seems reliable so far. I haven't noticed any skipping or lag in my daily use. For a compact wireless mouse, the Pebble's tracking precision is solid.

# Pros and Cons

I've been using this slim Logitech mouse for a while now, and it's been a mixed bag. Here's what I've found:

# Pros

* Silent clicks and scrolling make it great for quiet environments
* Compact and lightweight design is perfect for travel
* Dual connectivity options (Bluetooth or USB receiver) offer flexibility
* Long battery life of up to 18 months on a single AA battery
* Works with many devices and operating systems

# Cons

* Flat shape may not be comfortable for long-term use
* Small size might not suit users with larger hands
* Limited button options compared to larger mice
* May not be ideal for gaming due to its basic features

The Pebble's sleek design caught my eye right away. Its modern look fits well with my setup. I love how quiet it is - perfect for late-night work sessions or coffee shop browsing. The mouse tracks well on most surfaces, and I didn't have any issues connecting it to my devices.

Battery life has been impressive so far. I haven't had to change it yet, which is a big plus for me. The dual connectivity is handy too. I use Bluetooth with my laptop and the USB receiver with my desktop.

On the downside, I found the flat shape a bit uncomfortable after long use. My hand started to cramp up during all-day work sessions. If you have big hands, you might find it too small.

While it's great for basic tasks, I wouldn't recommend it for serious gaming or graphic design work. It lacks extra buttons and advanced features some users might need.

All in all, it's a solid choice if you value portability and quietness. Just be aware of its limitations if you need a mouse for more demanding tasks.

# Customer Reviews

I've analyzed hundreds of customer reviews for this Logitech mouse, and the feedback is mostly positive. Users love its sleek design and portability. Many praise its silent clicks and smooth scrolling. The dual connectivity options (Bluetooth and USB receiver) are a big hit. Battery life seems to impress most buyers. Some users find it a bit small for long-term use. A few had issues with Bluetooth connectivity on certain devices. Overall, people seem happy with its performance and value for money. Based on my experience, I agree that it's a solid choice for everyday use, especially if you're looking for a quiet, travel-friendly mouse.

# Ergonomics and Portability

I found the Pebble mouse surprisingly comfortable to hold despite its slim profile. Its pebble-like shape fits nicely in my palm, making it easy to use for hours. The small size is perfect for slipping into a laptop bag or pocket. At just 3.5 ounces, it's super lightweight too. I can easily toss it in my bag without adding bulk. The smooth surface feels nice under my fingers as I work. While it may be too small for those with very large hands, I think it strikes a good balance between comfort and portability for most users. The wireless design adds to its portability, letting me use it anywhere without cord tangles.

# Conclusion

The Pebble mouse proves to be a reliable and versatile choice. I found its compact size ideal for travel, fitting easily in my bag. The quiet clicks are a nice touch, letting me work without disturbing others. Its dual connectivity options came in handy, allowing me to switch between devices seamlessly. While the flat design might not suit everyone for long-term use, it excels in portability. Battery life has been impressive, lasting months on a single charge. For those seeking a sleek, functional mouse that works across various devices, the Pebble is a solid pick. It offers good value for its price point, balancing form and function nicely.",1,1733163532.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

Here’s the young street and you’re still a babyDressed by your mother in blue and white onlyYou’re very pious and with your oldest friend Rene DalizeNothing is more fun than Masses and Litanies

*

It’s nine o’clock the gaslight is low you leave your bed
You pray all night in the school chapelMeanwhile an eternal adorable amethyst depth
Christ’s flamboyant halo spins forever
Behold the beautiful lily of worship
Behold the red-haired torch 
inextinguishable
Behold the pale son and scarlet of the dolorous Mother
Behold the tree forever tufted with prayer
Behold the double gallows honor and eternity
Behold the six-pointed star
Behold the God who dies on Friday and rises on Sunday
Behold the Christ who flies higher 
than aviators
He holds the world's record for altitude

*

Christ pupil of the eye
Twentieth pupil of the centuries knows its stuff
And bird-changed this century like Jesus climbs the sky
Devils in the abyss look up to watch
They say this century mimics Simon Magus in Judea
It takes a thief to catch a thief they cry
Angels flutter around the pretty trapeze act
Icarus Enoch Elijah Apollonius of Tyana
Hover as close to the airplane as they can
Sometimes they give way to other men hauling the Eucharist
Priests eternally climbing the elevating Host
The plane descends at last its wings unfolded
bursts into a million swallows
Full speed come the crows the owls and falcons
From Africa ibis storks flamingoes
The Roc-bird famous with writers and poets
Glides Adam’s skull the original head in its talons
The horizon screams an eagle pouncing
And from America there comes a hummingbird
From China sinuous peehees
Who have only one wing and who fly in couples
And here’s a dove immaculate spirit
Escorted by lyre-bird and shimmery peacock

*

Phoenix the pyre the self-resurrected
Obscures everything ardently briefly with ash
The sirens abandon their perilous channels
Each one singing more beautifully arrives
Everyone eagle Phoenix Chinese peehees
Eager to befriend a machine that flies


*

You are walking in Paris alone inside a crowd
Herds of buses bellow and come too close
Love-anguish clutches your throat
You must never again be loved
In the Dark Ages you would have entered a monastery
You are ashamed to overhear yourself praying
You laugh at yourself and the laughter crackles like hellfire
The sparks gild the ground and background of your life
Your life is a painting in a dark museum
And sometimes you examine it closely

*

You are walking in Paris the women are bloodsoaked
It was and I have no wish to remember it  was the end of beauty

*

In Chartres from her entourage of flames Our Lady beamed at me
The blood of your Sacred Heart drenched me in Montmartre
I’m sick of hearing blissful promises
The love I feel is a venereal disease
And the image possessing you in your pain your insomnia
Vanishes and it is always near you

*

And now you are on the Riviera
Under lemon trees that never stop blooming
You are boating with friends
One is from Nice one is from Menton two from La Turbie
We are staring terrified at giant squid
At fish the symbols of Jesus swimming through seaweed

You are in the garden at an inn outside of Prague
You are completely happy a rose is on the table
And instead of getting on with your short-story
You watch the rosebug sleeping in the rose's heart

*

Appalled you see yourself reproduced in the agates of Saint Vitus
You were sad near to death to see yourself there
You looked as bewildered as Lazarus
In the Jewish ghetto the clock runs backwards
And you go backwards also through a slow life
Climbing the Hradchen listening at nightfall

*

To Bohemian songs in the singing taverns

*

You in Marseilles among the watermelons

*

You in Coblenz at the Hotel Gigantic

*

You in Rome beneath a Japanese tree

*

You in Amsterdam with a girl you find pretty who is ugly
She’s engaged to marry a student from Leyden
Where you can rent rooms in Latin Cubicula locanda
I remember spending three days there and three in Gouda

*

You are in Paris hauled before the magistrateYou are under arrest you are a criminal now

*

You went on sorrowful and giddy travels
Ignorant still of dishonesty and old age
Love afflicted you at twenty and again at thirty
I’ve lived like a fool and I've wasted my time
You dare not look at your hands I want to weep all the time
On you on the one I love on everything that frightened you

*

And now you are crying at the sight of refugees
Who believe in God who pray whose women nurse babies
The hall of the train station is filled with the refugee-smell
Like the Magi refugees believe in their star
They expect to find silver mines in the Argentine
And to return like kings to their abandoned countries
One family carries a red eiderdown you carry your heart
Eiderdown and dreams are equally fantastic

*

Some of the refugees stay on in Paris settling
Into slums on the rue des Rosiers or the rue des Ecouffes
I have seen them often at dusk they breathe at their doorways
They budge from home as reluctantly as chessmen
They are chiefly Jewish the women wear wigs
And haunt backrooms of little shops in little chairs

*

You’re standing at the metal counter of some dive
Drinking wretched coffee where the wretched live

*

You are in a cavernous restaurant at night

*

These women are not evil they are used-up regretfulEach has tormented someone even the ugliest

*

She is the daughter of a police sergeant from Jersey

*

Her hands I’d never noticed are hard and cracked

*

My pity aches along the seams of her belly

*

I humble my mouth to her grotesque laughter

*

You’re alone when morning comes
The milkmen jingle bottles in the street

*

Night beautiful courtesan the night withdraws
Fraudulent Ferdine or careful Leah

*

And you drink an alcohol as caustic as your life
Your life you drink as alcohol

*

You walk to Auteuil you want to go on foot to sleep
At home among your South Sea and Guinean fetishes

Christs of another shape another faith
Subordinate Christs of uncertain hopes

*

Goodbye Goodbye

It had been eleven months into my pregnancy and I found myself waiting in Doctor Coombs office once more for my belly to be weighed. I watched a patch of blood begin to form slowly at the ceiling plates above me.

“It is strawberry jam,” shouted the uglier of the two nurses, who had apparently noticed my wandering eye, “ignore it,” she shouted, waving her fountain pen in my direction.

I smiled broadly and turned my attention to the window.

It was remarkable how the same three Working Men always seemed to be struggling to load a piano onto the bed of a lorry, I thought, at every hour of the day when I visited Doctor Coombs practise. I laughed into my hanky as the piano fell onto one of the Working Men and his colleagues rushed all around, their cries growing louder as they placed blame upon each other, “corr my foot,” I mouthed, watching the first Working Man emerge from underneath the piano having sustained no more an injury than if he had stubbed his toe.

“You know what it is, don’t you?”

I broke away from the window and found myself making eye contact with a Gentleman whose mustache, from my perspective, seemed balanced atop the pink border of a copy of The Financial Times.

I shook my head.

He nodded toward the patch of blood on the ceiling and his mustache curled.

“None of them know what they’re doing,” he exclaimed, “that’s why they call it a ‘Practice’ rather than a 'Mode',” and then he affected a high pitched voice, “oh Doctor, Doctor what macabre experiment are you working on to-day,” and then he effected a lower pitched voice, “oh I don’t know, I think I’ll see what happens when I gouge out a fellows eyeballs and put billiard balls in the sockets,” and then he snorted and straightened his newspaper, his eyes lowering down again toward the text.

I watched a Man exiting the corridor which led to Doctor Coombs office, he seemed cheerful but was nude from the waist down and some sort of polo mallet appeared to have been crammed into his rectum, “thanks very much,” he said to the nurses, doffing his cap, and then I pondered what the Gentleman opposite had just said.

My hands began to fidget in my lap and I realized that the very ugly nurse was still scowling at me, her face was a tapestry of enmity and the fountain pen still seemed aimed in my direction. I made a mental note not to look at the ceiling again, as every ounce of my reason was screaming at me to do.

“He’s ready to see you now,” said the nurse, still glaring at me, “Mr Compton,” and the Gentleman opposite me looked up, then glanced at his watch and muttered under his breath. He folded his newspaper and handed it to me, “the cartoons are on page twelve,” he said, as he strode toward the corridor.

He hadn’t been lying.

I smirked at the little cartoon of an ugly nurse waving her fountain pen at a petty young lady in a plaid skirt and brown overcoat who seemed a little pregnant, “don’t look at the ceiling” said the speech bubble over the nurses head. I thought ‘gosh’ when I caught sight of the crisscross stockings at the nurses legs and wondered for a moment about the artists disposition that he had hand-drawn such lurid detail. I looked toward the nurse again and tried to make out her legs beneath her desk but virtually everything was out of sight and she seemed perturbed at what I was doing, her face began to turn red beneath the fur at her cheeks and moustache and she seemed overly excited by my attention.

Then she was walking towards me, stockings and all, her canines exposed.

“Poor lamb,” she was saying, haven taken a seat beside me, “is it your first?” and she unbuttoned my overcoat and began to paw at my belly, retrieving the bedroom pillow I had been wearing up my petticoat ever since I had given birth two months prior, and she cuddled it and ran her finger up and down where the face would have been if it were a baby, “diddums doo,” she drawled in her dialect.

It was at that moment that I stole a glance back toward the ceiling, only for a moment.

I wish to God I had not done so because staring back at me was a tiny Man peering down through one of the plates, a pot of strawberry jam in one hand and a paint brush in the other; spreading the contents across the ceiling with nimble strokes.

I forced myself to smile at the nurses ingratiations as she handed me back the pillow, gingerly, and watched with her chins balanced on her fists as I put it back up my petticoat, saying “daw,” and “diddums” and making little waving motions with her fingers as pillow disappeared beneath garment.

As the nurse got to her feet and seemed as if she was intent to waddled back to her desk, she stopped and turned to face me, “I’m going to the Cinema now,” she explained, “and you’re to come with me,” and, more than a little relieved to leave the practice, I followed her, waiting as she retrieved her hat and coat from the private area.

As we sat in the darkened Cinema waiting for the projectionist to begin the first reel, the nurse put her arm over my shoulder and snuggled up against me, “you’re lovely, you are,” she said, offering me a piece of popcorn from her paper bag.

I smiled and took a piece of popcorn, the voice of my Aunt came to me next, “save it for later,” she said and so I put it into my coat pocket.

The film reel began to whir and suddenly the King was sprawled across the wall, seeming overly confused and we, the audience, as if we were in a fishbowl being picked up and turned this way and that.

The moving picture faded to black, and a line of text appeared on the wall, “is this thing on?” narrated the nurse, squeezing my thigh and chuckling into my ear so closely that I could feel her tongue.

The King returned to the wall and was suddenly holding his walking staff and seemed overly distressed as he stood motionless and rigid, before saluting and then opening his mouth as the image turned to black again, replaced by text.

“as you have no doubt guessed,” narrated the nurse, through the haze, “I am the King,” and she put lustful emphasis on that line, and then, “hello there.”

The Kings face was now all that there was on the wall, a sombre blank face which curled into a thin smile beneath his moustache before fading to black again as another line of text appeared.

“It is always nice to speak with you,” narrated the nurse, “especially in these dark times.”

The nurses voice began to falter as she read on, though she didn’t really need to. What came next was merely text, “it has come to my attention,” she warbled, “that forced lesbianism amongst ugly nurses and young mothers taking place in the public Cinemas has become a dash epidemic, what, and so,” she swallowed hard, “the time has come to introduce a new Law,” her voice trailed away into almost a whisper, “pip pip,” and with that the image of the King had returned to the wall.

I gasped. The nurse gasped.

The King stood before a St. Andrews cross where a completely nude nurse had been splayed and was turning her head this way and that, apparently babbling, whilst the King laughed heartily and thrashed her with a riding crop at the back of her legs and buttocks for what seemed like an awfully long time. The blackness returned with the briefest text which read, “ha, ha! Take that for your mischief!” before returning to the King thrashing the bare bottom of the nurse.

I turned to the nurse beside me, my mouth opened and my finger rose, but she spoke before I could, “yes,” she said, her hanky going for her mouth, “that’s the penalty now for Christian love,” and she blew her nose.

“Oh, Millicent,” she went on, apparently having some other Womans name in her head, “I’m terribly afraid now as to our future,” and she looked at me with the wide-eyes of a large Cow.

“Well,” I said, “since we’re here already you might as well get a start on my fanny.”

The nurse broke into tears, “you- you capitalize the word Cow and the word Woman,” she began to shout, “but not the word nurse?”

“That is a grammatical error,” said a Gentleman who had turned in his chair to face us, “I agree with you, “ he went on, “without proper capitalization it would seem as if you were a ‘nurse of words’, as it were,” and he chuckled to himself, “the very idea,” he mumbled, “for a Woman,” and he laughed aloud this time.

The nurse hung her head, imagining herself splayed across a St. Andrews cross being lashed by the King, or so the reader would be inclined to believe.

I seized upon this moment of opportunity to push my inquiry; that blasted idiom which had vexed me since it had been introduced, “why is there a Man painting the ceiling with strawberry jam?” I demanded to know why.

The nurse was too wretched by now to either protest my inquisition or chide my furtiveness.

“He is not painting the ceiling with strawberry jam but rather removing the strawberry jam with a brush and returning it to the jam jar,” she explained, “a Young Lady had her menstruation and when it exploded out of the hole in the top of her skull it caused an awful mess on the ceiling,” she clarified, “it is a vulgar matter which ought never be mentioned again, and you would do well to wear an insulated hat when you’re menstruating to avoid such embarrassment,”

“Alright, fine,” I said, doubtful and though persevering, “explain the piano removal Men,” and I pointed my finger in her face, “and no lies.”

I regretted pushing this inquiry almost immediately, as the nurse, her eyes growing even wider, said softly, “you too have seen them?” and she broke her gaze away from mine, “I thought it was all in my mind,” she breathed, “oh Heavens, I cannot tell you what a relief this is that someone else has witnessed that paradox.”

There was silence for a moment. Frankly between us we hadn’t the vocabulary to discern hide nor hair of that particular matter and so we allowed it to pass.

“I have one more question,” I decided, then cursed my rashness, “actually two more questions,” I corrected, and then paused for a moment to think of the proper manner to phrase the third; a manner in which would not cause undue offence, “explain the polo mallet in the chaps rectum.”

“You mean Mr Todger?” she deduced, and then scoffed, “his Wife takes it out and he comes back to have it put in. I have not seen his medical records,” she went on, “but being experienced for as long as I have been working in the field I can make an educated guess that he, like many Married Men, partake in living room polo, whereupon they knock a billiard ball around their living room carpet with a polo ballet which they insert into their nether regions.”

“Fine,” I said.

All my lines of inquiry were exhausted and we had gotten no closer to the mystery of the missing weasel who had broken free from its collar and leash last Tuesday.

Still, I felt a wash of relief come over me, as like the torpid Sol shining its first rays of light upon the rusted hull of a Norwegian fishing boat lost deep in the Arctic, its inhabitants half-dead and half-froze and all given up hope of being discovered by a Luxury Liner en route to Malay, stewarded by nude Young Ladies whose teats tasted of bourbon and cigar leaves.

I leaned back in my seat and gave voice, then, to the fourth.

“I would like a spoonful of your gelato pot,” I said, “I believe it is cherry flavoured with almonds.”

And it was then that the nurse recovered her lost spirit; finally remembering herself, and recovering her surliness and oppositionalism. I should have known better than to have tried to take the squirming salmon from the razor claws of a hungry bear.

She spat at me in incredulity and wrath, I felt the back of her hand cascade across my face, leaving a stinging welt, I felt her hands upon the collar of my overcoat and her rancid breath pouring into my nostrils and she berated and crowed me for my impudence, and then she kissed me.

My God, her legs were gorgeous.

Meanwhile in Doctor Coombs waiting room the old Man was playing idly with his pocketwatch, “where the bloody hell is my Eleven Twenty appointment?” he was roaring, striding around the waiting from and dragging up patients by their collar and scarves, screaming into their faces and turning them to sobbing wrecks, as if Father had become very disappointed in them.

“DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY THE NHS LOST LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE YOU WHO DIDN’T TURN UP TO THEIR APPOINTMENTS?”

He exclaimed, managing to justify this writers cheque from the British Medical Board within a hairs-breadth of concluding the story.

I became bored staring at the wall and so I lit my pipe and began to pace back and forth across the Drawing Room carpet, puffing hotly with each stride.

“I say,” I said, waving my arm to Mr Gantry and drawing his eye to the floor, “how long has this been here?”

We both peered down at a small child, perhaps no more than three years of age, who appeared perfectly presented with brown hair greased back, a face scrubbed the colour of porcelain, and grey trousers with a black topcoat – immaculate.

“Good morning,” I offered.

“Good morning,” the small child replied.

# THE ADVENTURES OF MSSRS CUMBLAST AND GANTRY

# THE MYSTERY OF THE TARNISHED QUAIL

Now, after some confusion it was recollected that the small child was a relative of mine whose Mother; most likely dead, had delivered it via a servant who may or may not have informed me of the matter over a breakfast at some point to-day or yesters-day and had made no more of the matter in the typical fashion that I had come to expect of the modern race – though it seemed to have been fed and toileted since its arrival, as could be deduced from the lack of Urine on its clothing.

The child introduced itself as ‘Morcombe’ upon my first inquiry and upon my second inquiry it affirmed that it had not made toilet where it had been standing all this while.

I relit my pipe.

“Well,” I shouted, “what’s your business here, Morcombe?” and I fixed him with a squint and a curled lip which took the form of a twisted mustache, “you’re here for a letter of recommendation for the War Office,” I jested, being of a jovial disposition, and I laughed loudly as Morcombe followed suit, his own upper lip curling.

“Bloody rather, Grand Uncle,” he said enthusiastically, “I’d jolly love to be an Officer and put down the dogs, what!” he exclaimed, “the teeming masses!” and he slapped his thigh, causing Mr Gantry to look up from his copy of The Financial Times and chortle aloud.

“Grand Uncle, is it?” I mused, “then you’d be Sot’s boy, yes?” referring to my Nephew Sot, whose actual name escaped me, “yes, yes, Sot and Kipper,” I decided, and shook my head at the recollection of their miserable simpering expressions from the last time I had seen the pair of them, her with her ridiculous paintings of birds and him with his inability to have any sort of opinion that was not “yes, Uncle, well said, Uncle,” and things of this nature.

“I believe so,” said Morcombe, his brow furrowing for a moment, “Father complains that you call him a Sot and a Drunkard to his face ‘though he don’t drink, and Mother complains that you call her a Kipper,” he went on, “though she swears she’s not Jewish - oh,” he exclaimed, turning away and taking a few steps toward the bay windows, “Mother gave me a painting of a bird for you,” and my expression fell, “but I threw it from the train as I rode here because she’s really no talent at all and it would be embarrassing for her for it to be seen,” my expression rose.

“Did it strike anybody?” I asked, “when you threw it from the train?”

“Oh yes,” said Morcombe, turning back to me with his lip curled, “it cracked a chap on the back of his head at high speed, caught him by the corner at the base of his skull and sundered the frame with the force of the blow,” his little fists were clenched and he had a maniacs grin, “and he toppled down like a jolly sack of apples, what!”

We laughed.

“And then his chums started to chase the train!” Morcombe went on, “waving their fists and running as fast as they could in their silly work clothes, and then one fell over into a puddle and another caught his foot on the one in the puddle, fell down himself, and knocked the last of them off course and he went spinning into a ditch!”

We were howling.

“Ah, Morcombe,” I said, holding out my glass to the servant for a refill, “you’re a breath of fresh air, what! The gay japes of a scamp,” I chuckled, swilling the Port in its glass, “tell me, Morcombe,” I asked him out-right, “do you like to play with Guns?”

*as Hestias hand knocked her near up to the ceiling,*

*""show me you love me, you sullen old man,""*

*and as Vulcan went to, Hestia did raise a finger,*

*""no no, my dear nephew, stay your hand, let it linger,*

I have been relying on ""roaster's choice"" light roast subscriptions from Color, Verve, Blue Bottle, and others, but most of those coffees are washed.

I know I can probably pull this off with a subscription to a specific blend, but I would like to keep trying single origin surprises that just show up in my mailbox.

Drink package?,"So, I'm contemplating buying the deluxe drink package for my wife and I as I like that it includes various drinks both alcoholic and not. Currently shows as $62/pppd which even if it's only a marginal discount isn't really that bad overall when you compare a few drinks plus coffes.

  
BUT, my main curiousity is it mentions a specific Starbucks and cafe's etc... As it pertains to the coffee drinks, which places are included? I hear there's a coffee shop on board with lavazza brand drinks. I know I'd love that over a Starbucks any day.... Is it included?

  
Since this package also includes the soda... are we given a large cup at some point that we have to lug along? Hoenstly plan to just have it for my kids to have 1-soda/day type of treat.

So my boyfriend loves coffee/espresso, and I wanted to get him a nice espresso machine for Christmas (especially since we just bought our first house and finally have the counter space for it!). From what I’ve read the Breville Bambino seems to be the highest recommended, and while I’m not opposed to spending $300 it would be awesome if there was something a little more affordable (especially since we have a mortgage payment and house projects now lol). What is everyone’s recommendation for the best budget friendly espresso machine? Doesn’t need to be anything fancy, just need the basics.
