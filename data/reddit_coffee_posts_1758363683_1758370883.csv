I am noticing that I am extremely sensitive to caffeine now which was never an issue before. I get heart palpitations, nauseating anxiety and shortness of breath when I need to speak in public. This is a major problem as I often need to hold meetings at work and I have a rather senior position. Has anyone else experienced this since going sober?

If theres attraction, mystery, and a spark I’m sure we’ll push things a little further than just friends. 

Not looking to rush into anything anytime soon. Let’s get to know each other a bit, meet over a coffee/boba and see if we vibe first. I have an endless list of cafes I want to check out around the city. 

Tall, dark, and handsome. 6’ Toronto born and raised. Living in the west end and can drive anywhere, tattoos, fashion sense, work full time, hygienic, clean, confident and attractive. Kink friendly and dominant but reserve that for later discussions. I’m respectful of your time and boundaries, value communication and your safety is always important to me.

In my spare time you can catch me reading in the park, hiking and listening to my playlists, at the gym, or at events around the city. I try not to get into gremlin indoors mode until at least the first snowfall.

Looking for someone who’s 25+, single, emotionally available, funny, has free time, and a willingness to try new things. I do have a soft spot for sweet and bubbly personalities. A similar taste in music in the fastest way to get my attention aside from a tray of banana muffins.

Here’s some of the fall outings I have in mind 

Pumpkin carving • Apple picking • Fall picnics • Baking with seasonal ingredients • Haunted houses and corn mazes come Oct • Small town day trips • Cafe crawls • Speak easys • Reading nights inside • Farmers markets • Hikes when the leaves change colors

So feel free to send me an intro with what you’re looking for and let’s see how we can make the most of the season.",1,1758370630.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

1nlwits,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1nlwits/as_a_shy_woman_i_regret_that_men_dont_approach/,"As a shy woman, I regret that men don’t approach women anymore. I have very little chance to meet someone?","
As a shy and introverted woman with mild social anxiety, I regret that men no longer approach women in a cultured, respectful way.

I guess for extroverted and outgoing women, they will find a man anyway, because they have no problem going to clubs, bars, and other social places or they approach men themselves.

But if I have social anxiety and can’t go to a club at night with loud music, I really don’t know where I can meet men. I spend a lot of time at libraries, coffee shops, parks, etc., but men don’t approach there they don’t even look at women.

I don’t want to set up a Tinder account or Instagram and expose myself to men who send vulgar messages and swipe through women like in a catalog. I don’t want to be part of that catalog.

once set up a tinder account, and I got a lot of messages from men, but I guess it was very cheap attention. Knowing that they message multiple women at the same time, just to see which woman will go out on a date with them first, I don’t think it’s really about meeting people it feels more like luring women.

At work, it’s the same. They have thousands of opportunities with extroverted women on clubs and dating apps, so they don’t have to risk approaching women in college or at work or any neutral place.

Men don’t even approach in college. I’m nice looking and have been approached in public a few times by men who told me I’m beautiful and asked for my number but I’m not into that low quality pickup style. They just say hello and immediately ask for my number because I’m beautiful. I would feel like a cheap prostitute if I agreed to give my number after such a shallow approach focused only on looks.

I think for introverted women, it’s almost impossible. I notice that tinder and party girls are the ones who usually have boyfriends. Also, extroverted women with lots of friends often meet their boyfriends through introductions from mutual friends.

For women who aren’t very social and prefer calm places like libraries, theaters, or cinemas, men don’t approach at all.

It feels like you have to dress provocatively and go to a club with loud music. I’m not into that, and I don’t think clubs or Tinder catalogs are the place to find decent men.

And it’s not like I don’t go out I go to college, libraries, theaters, coffee shops, etc. Very few men approach in these places.


I won’t talk to men except for some neutral reason, like asking if they know where a street is or what date an exam is. I won’t flirt with a man first. Definitely won’t start a conversation with them first, because what if he turns out to be a creep and won’t leave me alone?

1nlwiev,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nlwiev,A Zen Master's Journey: Taming a Jazzma,"My journey with my Fender Vintera Jazzmaster was supposed to be simple. My initial intention was to set it up straight from the factory, exactly as Leo Fender designed it. I added a shim and used some blue Loctite on the bridge, but then I noticed the guitar came with a threaded tremolo arm and a cap with the wrong color. So I decided my only replacement would be the tremolo arm, opting for one from Staytrem. It was fantastic, and I was quite happy, having learned the ""Jazzmaster zen"" of living with imperfections. 

But my peace didn’t last long. I fell into the modification temptation, watching and reading everything offset-related. My positive experience with Staytrem led me to order one of their bridges. I figured the 42-week wait time would help me fight the temptation, but I got lucky and it arrived in about 20 weeks. And it was absolutely perfect. At the same time, I was trying to close a long-standing ""gestalt."" I desperately wanted a ""real,"" American Fender. I decided to ""sin"" and buy a Telecaster, thinking it was the ultimate second guitar—a Texas Tea Ultra II. It was a super cool guitar, but completely wrong for an offset-by-nature guy like me. I was faced with a real dilemma: should my ""primary"" guitar be so much less than my ""secondary""? The Telecaster went back, and the gestalt was open again. 

I couldn't afford a Custom Shop or a legendary used Jazzmaster. My options were the American Professional II, the Ultra, or the AVRI II. The Ultra was a no-go after all the reviews. The AVRI II had very controversial reviews. So I finally got my ""real"" Fender: an Am Pro II Jazzmaster. 

And then I had an existential question: why do I need two Jazzmasters? I decided to sell my wonderful Vintera and get a Super Sonic to cover the humbucker area. But no one was quick enough to buy my Vintera, and I had a change of heart. I decided this guitar truly needed my love, care, and... more modifications. And probably some Creamery humbuckers. 

The first thing to go was the ugly tort pickguard (sorry, tort fans). Finding the right replacement was a long and painful process, but I was rewarded when I found Hudson from Hudson Unique Parts. This guy is one of a kind. His craftsmanship and patience with ""special"" customers like me are outstanding. He helps you decide what you really want, gives you updates all the way through, ships on time, and even packs the order like a gift. I felt like a kid on my birthday again when I opened the package. 

When I started the second round of mods, I tried to brush the shiny, ugly tremolo plate. Don’t ever do this with cheaper (Korean?) models. The finish was so thin that a few touches with a brush revealed the copper underneath. I learned that Mexican Jazzmasters use lower-quality tremolos than the American ones. I had to choose between AVRI, Mastery, and Descendant vibratos. The Mastery seemed like the best compromise, and it was already brushed. This vibrato is absolutely outstanding—much better than the Panorama, in my opinion. And Hudson can even produce a matching plate for my Mastery! 

Of course, I had to get rid of the ugly knobs. Who could resist real Kluson witch hats? The eBay listing said ""vintage white,"" but the seller and I have very different perceptions of that color. The knobs were a surprise—a very white-gray. Coffee didn't age them at all. Before my third attempt, I used very fine sandpaper, which finally helped. I also replaced the nut with one from Tone Ninja. I'm very happy with that! 

So, the first part of the upgrade (aesthetics) is complete. The second, with the pickups, is next. The aesthetic of my Am Pro II was also seriously upgraded, but that’s a different story.",2,1758370146.0,offset,0,1.0,False

- 16‑inch Full‑HD IPS display with thin bezel for a larger viewing area.
- Connects via USB‑C or USB‑A and draws power from the host device.
- Built‑in kickstand and optional VESA‑mount provide flexible positioning.
- Eye‑care technologies include flicker‑free operation and low‑blue‑light filtering.
- Lightweight and slim design fits easily in a laptop bag, suitable for travel, trains, or coffee‑shop workstations.
- Priced at $169, a $40 reduction from the regular price, making a quality dual‑screen setup more affordable.

Why it matters: The discount widens access to a portable dual‑screen solution for students and remote workers, though the monitor is intended for general productivity rather than high‑performance gaming or professional graphics work.

1nlwa8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/suppsavings/comments/1nlwa8p/i_tried_all_17_transparent_labs_protein_flavors/,I tried all 17 transparent labs protein flavors and some were awful,"I went through the entire lineup. 

Some flavors I loved, some I forced myself to finish, and a couple I straight up regretted.

Here is how it actually went.

# Quick ranking for the impatient

**Best daily drivers**

* Salted chocolate caramel: sweet but balanced, works in water or milk
* Dark chocolate: less sweet, rich cocoa, safe to drink every day
* Milk chocolate: smooth and creamy, closest to chocolate milk

**Fun to rotate**

* Mocha: doubles as a morning coffee shake
* French vanilla: versatile, works in smoothies and baking
* S’mores: dessert vibe, best in milk

**Skip these**

* Blueberry pancakes: artificial blueberry, too sweet
* Chocolate chip banana bread: strong fake banana, gets old fast
* Cinnamon french toast: syrup heavy, cloying sweet

# Why flavor choice matters

The difference between finishing a tub and letting it sit on the shelf is flavor. If it is too sweet, you get sick of it. If it is bland, you will never look forward to it.

Protein only works if you actually use it. That means taste matters more than most people admit.

# My testing method

* Water test: one scoop, 12 to 16 ounces
* Milk test: one scoop, 10 to 12 ounces
* Smoothie test: blended with banana and oats
* Baking test: added to simple cookie mix
* Foam and clump check after two minutes of rest

I ran every flavor through this same system.

# Flavor categories explained

**Safe daily**

Salted chocolate caramel, dark chocolate, milk chocolate.

**Versatile for recipes**

French vanilla and milk chocolate work in oats, smoothies, and baking.

**Niche and fun**

Mocha for coffee drinkers, mint chocolate chip for dessert lovers.

**Regret pile**

Blueberry pancakes, banana bread, and cinnamon french toast.

# What surprised me

Dark chocolate is bitter in water but perfect in milk.

Mocha actually replaced my morning coffee for a week.

S’mores was fun at first but I could not drink it daily.

# What to do if you hate your tub

* Bake with it in cookies or oats
* Mix half scoop with a safer flavor
* Use it in smoothies to cover the taste
* Trade or sell it, plenty of people on Reddit swap tubs

# Where I got mine

All of these came from the official site. Check the [transparent labs protein powder](https://www.transparentlabs.com/products/proteinseries-100-grass-fed-whey-protein-isolate/?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=impact&utm_campaign=131624_Online%20Tracking%20Link&irgwc=1) page for the current flavor list. I may earn on your purchase, helps support and continue my testing!

# Bottom line

If you want one flavor that never gets old, pick salted chocolate caramel.

If you like less sweetness, go with dark chocolate.

If you want versatility for smoothies or baking, french vanilla is your best bet.

The rest are fun once in a while but not worth committing to a whole tub",1,1758369452.0,suppsavings,0,1.0,False

My dreams have always been really vivid, but kinda repeat, and I used to lucid dream all the time, until I was chased down and injected with something and haven’t had a lucid dream since, but that’s a story for another time! 😂

     This morning, I had one I’ve never had before and I’m kind of sad! I “woke up” in my dream and knew I was where I was supposed to be, but nothing looked familiar. I knew I was in my house, and as I woke up I started moving around throughout the house, it was full of stuff, had a kids room too. I was SO happy. 

     I heard the shower running, so I went into the bathroom and saw a lady much older than me irl, but I knew it was right. She was so beautiful, and again I felt an overwhelming sense of happiness, like I’ve known her forever. I complimented her and she just smiled and kinda rolled her eyes and got out of the shower. 

     We went into the kitchen where she started making coffee, and I started asking questions because I was so confused. She politely answered all of them, when a little girl, still in pajamas and messy hair came running to me for a big fat hug. Again. Overwhelming happiness.       

     As I was asking more questions, the woman told me that I have dementia, and that it’s pretty bad, and that it was hard because I was still relatively young for that (I’d say we were about 48-53 in the dream) and told me a little about my life and everything. I just remember being kinda shocked, but so so so happy to have apparently found my person, and clearly spent the better part of a lifetime with her, and to have had a child! 
     
     I woke up shortly after, and the dream ended. Now I’m feeling a little empty and sad this morning lol. I think there’s more to dreams than we think or understand, I just know that even after a lifetime together, old(er) age, and having dementia, if I still felt like I could play around with my person and give em a few cheeky compliments while they’re in the shower, then that dream life must have been so fun and fulfilling.

1nlw4l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/suppsavings/comments/1nlw4l4/common_problem_choosing_the_right_flavor_without/,Common problem: choosing the right flavor without wasting money,"One of the most common questions people ask is simple: *which flavor won’t get old after two weeks?* The problem isn’t just about taste, it’s about avoiding flavor fatigue and making sure you actually finish the tub you paid for.

# Why flavor matters

If it tastes bad, you’ll stop drinking it. If it’s too sweet, you’ll get sick of it. And if it only works in milk, you’re stuck if you prefer water. Flavor is the difference between something you enjoy daily and something that ends up collecting dust.

# Key questions to ask yourself before buying

1. Do I usually mix with water, milk, or smoothies?
2. Do I want a safe daily flavor, or something fun to rotate in?
3. How sweet do I actually like my shakes?
4. Will I use it only post-workout, or also in recipes like oats and baking?

Answering these ahead of time will save you from making the wrong choice.

# Flavor types (broad categories)

* **Classic chocolate**: usually safest, less chance of regret.
* **Vanilla-based**: versatile for smoothies and baking.
* **Coffee-inspired**: doubles as a morning shake, but niche.
* **Dessert/fun flavors**: s’mores, mint, or fruit; great short term, often get old fast.

Most people do best starting with one safe flavor and one “fun” flavor, instead of going all-in on something experimental.

# Common mistakes people make

A lot of people buy the trendy flavor first and hate it in water. Others forget that milk makes everything sweeter, so a flavor that’s fine in water might taste overpowering in milk. Another mistake is buying a huge tub before testing if you can actually drink it every day.

# Practical tips from experienced users

* Start with one chocolate or vanilla + one fun flavor, rotate to avoid fatigue.
* Test every new flavor in water first; this shows its “true” taste.
* If a flavor is borderline, save it for smoothies where fruit or coffee can hide weak spots.

These simple steps make it way easier to avoid wasting money.

# What to do if you regret your choice

If you picked wrong, don’t panic. You can bake with it (cookies, protein oats, pancakes), mix half a scoop with a flavor you like, or even trade it with someone else. Most Reddit threads have people swapping tubs when they get tired of a flavor.

**Bottom line:** Don’t chase the flashiest flavor first. Anchor with a safe daily driver, then add one experimental option. That way, you avoid regret and always have something you actually look forward to drinking",1,1758368971.0,suppsavings,0,1.0,False

In a world that's always on, the most radical thing you can do is slow down. We've all felt the pressure to jump out of bed and into the chaos of the day. But what if there was a better way? What if the secret to a productive and peaceful day isn't about moving faster, but about starting slower?

A slow morning isn't just a trend; it's a deliberate choice. It's about trading frantic energy for intentional actions. It’s the difference between a rushed cup of coffee and a mindful moment to savor it. As you’ve seen in this video, a calm morning routine can look different for everyone, but the core idea is the same: prioritize peace over pressure.

Our mornings set the tone for the hours that follow. By taking a few extra moments for ourselves—whether it’s appreciating the sunrise, washing your face with intention, or simply enjoying a favorite cup of tea—we’re giving our minds and bodies the space they need to prepare.

Starting with calm, self-care, and nourishment isn't just about feeling good in the morning. It's about carrying that peace with you throughout the day. It’s about building a foundation of wellness that helps you handle challenges with more grace and focus.

So, go ahead. Give yourself permission to pause. The to-do list can wait. Your peace can't.",1,1758368916.0,Life,1,1.0,False

They have a generous refer-a-friend scheme where you earn a **free £50 credit** when you switch your energy to them. You're eligible if you have a smart meter, standard meter or economy 7 meter but you’d need to switch both your gas and electricity. Another plus: NO FEES if you decide to switch out elsewhere at any time!

**How to get your free £50 bonus with Octopus Energy:**

1. [Sign up to Octopus using my £50 refer-a-friend link here](https://share.octopus.energy/quiet-mouse-344)
2. Enter your post code and answer questions about your current energy use to receive a price quote. Click ""Sign me up"" to see the details about the proposed tariff, then confirm the switch once you’re happy.
3. Enter your gas and electricity meter ID/serial numbers, so have an old bill ready as this info will be on there already. Octopus is brilliant at updating you via email on the whole process with what you need to do at each step.
4. Your £50 reward will be credited to your account after your first direct debit has been taken - I received mine 2 weeks after the direct debit.

**My hot tips:**

* When getting your quote, enter your “actual” energy usage using an old bill instead of choosing the “low, medium, high” options to keep your direct debit payments accurate
* In your online account, you can reduce your monthly direct debits if you think they're too high - I lowered my mine by about 70%!

**My experience + timeline:**

I switched from Shell Energy to Octopus as it worked out cheaper across the board for both gas and electricity, so the £50 switch reward was a total bonus. The £50 was applied to my account less than 2 weeks after my first direct debit was taken and the switch process was probably the smoothest I’ve ever experienced. If you have a smart meter, you can also claim a free Caffe Nero or Greggs coffee each week as a free perk. Another plus: NO FEES if you decide to switch out elsewhere at any time!

About a year ago I was burning out. 10+ hours a day on my laptop. 4 coffees before 2pm. Blurry eyes. Brain fog. The 3pm crash.

I tried all the “focus” products out there… but either they didn’t work, or they completely ignored the real issue: screens wreck your eyes.

So I decided to build my own.

I’m not a big brand. I’m just one guy in a new city, betting my savings and time to solve a problem I was living every day.

Fast forward to last week… I launched my first product, called Day Shift™.

It’s a sachet drink with: •	Caffeine + L-theanine (the combo that makes green tea feel so smooth) •	MCT oil for sustained fuel •	A blend of 4 berries rich in anthocyanins (compounds studied for supporting eye health under heavy screen use)

From its rustic farmhouse style to its multifunctional features, it ticks a lot of boxes for someone like me who loves furniture that's not just decorative but also highly practical.

**Design & Aesthetic Appeal**

The distressed brown and black two-tone finish gives this coffee table a bold, farmhouse-chic vibe. I couldn’t help but admire the plank-effect styling and the small distress marks, which add character to my otherwise modern living room. It's square, with a generously sized 36x36-inch tabletop that easily accommodates magazines, decorative trays, or even snacks during movie nights. The industrial brackets on the edges are a subtle yet striking detail that enhances its rugged elegance. 

**Functionality & Features**

Living with two small kids and a dog means storage space is always premium real estate around here. What stood out immediately was its split-style design. The spring-loaded lift top has become a game changer for us. It allows me to work comfortably on my laptop or enjoy meals from the couch while stashing board games or throw blankets in the underlying compartment. I particularly appreciated the space under the hinged lid; it’s a lifesaver for someone who needs quick cleanup solutions in a busy household.

[Check Signature Design by Ashley T468-00 Valebeck price on Amazon.](https://verycosy.com/p/b07qvf5yw2/)

**Merits**

- Beautiful rustic design enhances room aesthetics  
- Lift-top doubles as a work or dining surface  
- Sturdy build, can handle up to 350 pounds  
- Ample storage under lift top and hinged lid  
- Perfect for family living spaces  

**Negatives**

- Weighs 72 pounds, difficult to move  
- Does not include all assembly tools  
- The lift-top mechanism could feel stiff initially  

**Assembly Process**

I’ll admit, putting this coffee table together took a bit of elbow grease. The instructions were clear, but the lack of included screwdrivers slowed me down slightly. If you’re not handy with flatpacks, roping in someone else might be wise. However, once assembled, the table felt solid and durable, with no wobbling or instability.

**Product Competitors**

Compared to similar pieces on the market, I found the Valebeck table to hold its own pretty well. Options like the Sauder Dakota Pass lift-top table deliver comparable features but lack the rugged industrial charm. Another contender, the IKEA Hemnes coffee table, offers a simpler design and lighter weight but falls short in terms of storage and build quality. What sets the Ashley Valebeck apart is how perfectly it blends style with utility—it just feels more like a centerpiece than an afterthought. 

**Smart Spending**

While it might sit at a slightly higher price point than basic coffee tables, I felt the investment was worthwhile given the quality and features. Furniture serves as a long-term commitment in most homes, and this table combines aesthetic appeal, functionality, and durability in a way that justifies its price.

I have a compulsion to drink caffeine despite it making me anxious and disassociated when combined with my daily Adderall XR dose. I’m 
Also extremely sensitive to caffeine when on these meds. Every day that I don’t drink caffeine I I feel so much better and vow to not do it again. Skip to a couple days later and the urge hits me and I reach for the coffee against my better judgement. I have to wonder why I do this to myself!

That time, du 3 gd to ka hotel ang gnhalinan sng mga empleyado and ang hotel na ara sa Gen.Luna ang grbe experience.
Every rooms, two agents ang gastay; so if you know this hotel and ambiance nia nii sa gwa, specially sa sulod classic gd ya. So ang room nga gnstayhan nmun, I think deluxe room nila to..1 queen bed and 1double. So mgsulod ka sa room, sa right side was the closet, infront was the CR.
That time nga nagstay na kmi, ngsulod sa kanya2x na rooms, eerie gd ang feeling, for almost 1week na stay nmun ka mega ko sa room nmun , ako ang indi ktulog mayu not because sang eerie and creepy feeling pro because indi ko kasahu na masanag; kay ang mega ko indi mgtulog nga patay ang suga nga sa cr lng gsiga...
The reason why indi sya gusto, kay sang first day nmun ngtransfer sa hotel nga ni, my nakita dw sya na bata na babayi sa closet, as in sa sulod closet nakaputi. That happened sng very first day.Ako nakita ko man sa perioheral vision ko pro, waai ko nalng gn mind ky para indi kami mahadluk.

Dayoff namun pareho and since pandemic, indi kami ka dali2x gwa or maggwa para maglagaw.

Second day....gabe galantw kami TV, ang tv medyo old model, so ako naboringan ko sa ginalantw nia, nghmbal ko mauna nlng ko tulog dala hatag sa iya remote.

In a world that's always on, the most radical thing you can do is slow down. We've all felt the pressure to jump out of bed and into the chaos of the day. But what if there was a better way? What if the secret to a productive and peaceful day isn't about moving faster, but about starting slower?

A slow morning isn't just a trend; it's a deliberate choice. It's about trading frantic energy for intentional actions. It’s the difference between a rushed cup of coffee and a mindful moment to savor it. As you’ve seen in this video, a calm morning routine can look different for everyone, but the core idea is the same: prioritize peace over pressure.

Our mornings set the tone for the hours that follow. By taking a few extra moments for ourselves—whether it’s appreciating the sunrise, washing your face with intention, or simply enjoying a favorite cup of tea—we’re giving our minds and bodies the space they need to prepare.

Starting with calm, self-care, and nourishment isn't just about feeling good in the morning. It's about carrying that peace with you throughout the day. It’s about building a foundation of wellness that helps you handle challenges with more grace and focus.

So, go ahead. Give yourself permission to pause. The to-do list can wait. Your peace can't.",2,1758368039.0,SlowLiving,0,1.0,False

Been angry at myself because of the past mistakes I did. Anyways here's what actually stuck with me:

1. Make it obvious, not hidden. Stop relying on willpower and start designing your environment. I put my gym clothes next to my bed and my phone charger in the kitchen. Small changes, massive results.
2. Stack habits, don't isolate them. Instead of ""I'll meditate sometime today,"" I do ""After I pour my morning coffee, I meditate for 5 minutes."" Linking new habits to existing ones is like giving them a GPS.
3. Start stupidly small. I wanted to read more, so I committed to reading ONE PAGE per day. Sounds ridiculous, but I haven't missed a day in 8 months. Now I read 20-30 pages without even thinking about it.
4. Focus on identity, not outcomes. Instead of ""I want to lose 20 pounds,"" I started saying ""I'm the type of person who works out."" Every small action became evidence of who I was becoming, not just what I was trying to achieve.
5. Never miss twice. Life happens. You'll skip a workout or eat junk food. The key is getting back on track immediately. Missing once is an accident, missing twice is the beginning of a new habit.
6. Make it satisfying immediately. I created a simple habit tracker and checked off each completed habit. That little dopamine hit from marking an X kept me going when motivation died.
7. Environment beats willpower every time. I removed Instagram from my phone's home screen and put Kindle there instead. Guess what? I started reading more and scrolling less. Your environment is constantly voting for your habits.

What's one tiny habit you could start today that would compound into something amazing over time? And what's the smallest version of that habit you could commit to? I realized for me it was working out. I stacked my other habits from working out early in the morning thanks to this book.

At the start I only felt the urgency at night when I tried to sleep but gradually over the year it progressed to a point where I felt the urgency during the day as well.

Originally I would only have flare ups very infrequently and they wouldn’t last for long. I was given Solifenacin and Mirabegron but I was still having flare ups so I was recommended to stop taking them. I began seeing a pelvic floor physio therapist about 2 months ago and have been using tens machine/doing stretches. I was also started on Amitriptyline and have been taking it for about 2 months as well (currently on 40mg). I’ve also had ultrasound scans and a flow rate test both of which were normal results. I took antibiotics after an embedded uti test but this didn’t alleviate symptoms and the test only showed a tiny amount of bacteria which they thought could have been contaminated from something else anyway.

Despite the various treatments my symptoms have gotten a lot worse over the last 4 months and I have basically been in a constant flare with intense urinary urgency with only a few days of normality. My only symptom is urgency and I feel this sensation as a pain around my urethra. I have no actual bladder pain. Could this still be IC or is there something I’m missing? Also I should say I don’t drink coffee or alcohol anyway so neither of these would be exacerbating symptoms. 

I also wonder if I should start retaking Solifenacin/Mirabegron as my symptoms were less severe when I was taking them but I can’t tell if that was actually because of the medicine or if my condition has just progressively worsened anyway. Is it common for IC symptoms to get worse over time?

This season though, I don’t know. It feels worse than usual. Playing Main tank is an absolute pain in lower ranks. People seem to refuse to use my shields, so why would I bother playing Mag or Strange. At least with Emma I can « kinda » impose the shield onto them. 

But also, CC and Tankbusting garbage is absolutely brutal this season. Tired of getting dragged around by Wolverines, watching IF press W into me, and no matter whether I stun him, ping him, drag him, nobody wants to burst him down, Ironman’s and other flyers being left unchecked, out of my range, heck, even Blade is an absolute pain in the ass to deal with. Same with Winter Soldier. 


Too much CC, too little tools for Tanks to get around them. There’s times where I can just straight up go make coffee and come back and still be in stunlock chains getting pummeled around. 


I wish there was a « diminishing return » CC passive for tanks where they get more and more resilient to CC the more they get hit with them.

The machine does recognise the milk, it will heat up the milk and transfer it to my cup, but it’s never hot. I just get hot milk.

1nlvkl2,https://i.redd.it/x78pqav70bqf1.jpeg,Does this mean i have H2S SIBO?,"I've had stomach issues for over a year now.

Stomach bloating, evening only diarrhoea (i fast through the day and drink only coffee, until dinner) and dry mouth (normal HBA1C and negative SSA/SSB for Sjogrens).

Deficient in Vitamin D as well as B12 (normal folate, however). Supplementing both in liquid form as pills don't do anything, which links to my malabsorption issues.

I did a gut dysbiosis test and it ruled out H.Pylori, candida, etc. Oral swab on my tongue ruled out thrush, despite enlarged papillae trapping bacteria (i use a tongue scraper daily.

It only revealed low stool PH value, low E.coli, sIGA and biffido bacterium. Since quitting completely alcohol, junk food and supplementing with s boullardi, prebiotics, l-glutamyne and bifido prebiotic, my bloating has reduced, but i still have stool issues. My morning stool is light brown and loose and has undigested food. Especially vegetables and banana chunks don't seem to get digested.

The stool also sometimes smells like I'm ill with the flu. No smelly gas or gas in general.

I also did a lactulose SIBO breath test and it came back negative for hydrogen and methane SIBO. The results show a normal flatline for both. 8ppm for Hydrogen and fluctuating line around 5 ppm for methane.

I did some research and ran it through ChatGPT and it said the flatline of hydrogen and methane may indicate H₂S SIBO instead. I am not entirely convinced, as i don't have frequent flatulence or egg-smelling gas.

The problem is I am in the UK and here it's extremely difficult to push for referrals or get any help from GP's, especially for gut issues. The most they do are stool test and any gut issues they usually pinpoint to IBS and send you your way.

I really want to fix my gut and the pre/probiotic regime i am doing has definitely helped in reducing the bloating and improving my dry mouth (I plan on adding lactobacilus GG, followed by 299v).

I just want to get answers.

I've been in recovery of my psychological health for more than twenty years and it goes extremely well generally in the last years. Since I have ME/CFS also, a somatic chronic inflammatory condition, I can only go slow though.

It goes well because there are tons of resources and understanding that I have been able to build or access over the years. On the other hand it is because I managed to break away from my abusive mother and sisters with which I was trapped in the scapegoat role. Just as important was that I quit any psychotherapeutic or psychiatric support five years ago.

Because my mother was a psychotherapist and a psychiatrist herself, psychiatric pathologization of my personality was part of her scapegoat abuse. A type of aggression that my psychotherapists sometimes unknowingly, sometimes just as abusively jumped in.

Therefore I got worse in every trial of psychotherapy, and the abusers, my mother, my sisters, and the abusive psychotherapists got the more aggressive the better I got and the better I understood that my main trauma was that I had become a victim of extreme and harmful psychiatrization as a child that my mother had started.

Over the past couple of years and months many very positive things have happened. I was able to stabilize ME/CFS. I could begin to do volunteer work. I was able to do training as a group facilitator to teach the Taking Action for Whole Health curriculum with the Copeland Center. My financial situation is secure for the next four to eight years. I have a GP that I trust and who trusts me, and I have the support of a pastor and a social worker, a Buddhist meditation teacher and a Chinese doctor, whenever I need it.

All five women were able to wrap their minds around the idea that the severe psychiatric problems that I developed as a teenager were the result of harmful and abusive psychotherapy practices. That was one of my biggest challenges. Finding people who believe me.

I think that what happened over the past couple of weeks was that all these milestones that I have reached and my happiness about it were like a trigger to a lot of unacknowledged pain from the battles that I fought for several decades, and the harm and the losses that it brought.

It was very strange. I wasn't depressed at all. And still I wasn't doing anything anymore except the most important things like eating and paying the bills. But for the rest I would only resort to my two most important numbing strategies. Coffee and randomly surfing the internet.

I think that it was the insight that I didn't find support for a very long time and fought all these battles alone that I couldn't tolerate.",3,1758367039.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

1nlvh7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nlvh7q/aita_for_working_on_my_partners_birthday/,AITA For Working on My Partners Birthday,"I (27F) planned a birthday party for my (30M) fiancé. I was really looking forward to doing this for him because he doesn’t like big gifts and I wanted to celebrate him thoughtfully. For reference, last year - I got him a really nice gift and had it sitting under a banner and streamer when he woke up and he actually ignored it all day. He was annoyed with me because of it and asked me not to do that again. 

I did not want a repeat of that and he seemed really excited to have friends over to watch the game and hang out. Anyways, we’re also planning to go on a small fall trip, we have a daughter (4F) and we want to really enjoy the season with her. 
We have been looking at rental properties for our stay. He sent me a few on my phone and while looking at them, I texted my friend who often sends me a lot of work -that I was looking to slow down (fiance says I prioritize my business over our home life...)
He was aggravated that I was on my phone while we were looking at the rentals - I apologized, put it down and tried to resume with what we were doing. He told me he was used to being treated like he didn’t matter growing up, so what’s new?
To be clear, this is not something that we often fight about, so I didn’t think it would have upset him the way it did. He decided he wanted to go to bed - I finished the dishes, went to our room and tried to be affectionate with him and lay with him. He kept moving my hand when I’d touch him, telling me he just wanted to go to bed. 

I should mention that I am a wedding photographer - I needed to finish editing a gallery so I could be completely done with work before his bday weekend. Considering he was giving me the cold shoulder and pretending he was asleep, I decided to go edit at 10:30pm. 

The next morning, he seemed to still be upset but okay-ish because I made him coffee and sent him to work with a kiss. My dad came and took our daughter for a few hours to spend time with her. I cleaned our kitchen, bathrooms and I wanted to take a short nap so I could finish folding my laundry and cleaning our floors before he got home. He ended up coming home early while I was still asleep and said I could’ve cleaned up some. I got up and started to finish up what I was doing earlier but he said it wasn’t the same now, and he shouldn’t have to tell me to clean. I tried to explain that I just needed to sweep, mop and finish folding clothes but that I fell asleep. He then told me that we should cancel his party because now he’s overwhelmed by all that needs to be done. I never asked him to do anything, specifically preparing everything myself because I didn’t want him to have to worry about anything. 
I was upset because I felt like I had ruined everything without even trying. He didn’t want to continue a conversation with me about it, he told me I was just mad because he called me out on not cleaning up and that he’s not even mad about it. He would not talk to me about it, he went to his truck and sat in it. My daughter started asking for her daddy, so I went outside and asked if he’d like me to just give him space if he wanted to come back in to see her. I looked at my notifications as I was walking outside and saw he had already deleted the event on Facebook. I was visibly upset, and I told him that I wasn’t sure if it had informed our guests it was canceled because he had just deleted the event. (By the way, it didn’t inform anyone) 

He told me I was obviously too over emotional and tired to understand why he was acting the way he was. The whole time stonewalling me.. not looking at me, talking super low and would barely give me a response. It is so rare that we can have a civil conversation without him shutting down. 
He started getting angry and saying he was so over this bullshit so I went inside because clearly I was making everything worse. He came inside for a few minutes - told me he’s going to bed canceling our fall trip before saying that he’s sorry, he can’t do this and left in his truck. I honestly felt shattered.. I still don’t understand why he had such an extreme reaction. 

His dad ended up coming over and explaining to me that his son was mad that I prioritized work over his birthday… I was throwing something away and overheard him say “if I didn’t have a daughter I don’t know what I would do”.. again, just fucking shattered. He stayed out in the house until his dad left and then said he was going to bed. 

Am I being an asshole here? I have apologized profusely, and if it was not clear, this is not the first time he has had a reaction like this. Now I’m making the homemade carrot cake I planned to make for his party, but who knows if he’ll even want to eat it. ",8,1758366864.0,AITAH,14,0.9,False
1nlvh50,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/1nlvh50/mixed_use_neighborhoods_are_the_answer_to_our/,Mixed Use Neighborhoods ARE the answer to our plight. But do it CORRECTLY.,"Too many times, I hear that nothing is more profitable than a single family home to a developer. And while that may be true SHORT TERM, in long term it makes no sense, and leaves residents of these communities creating reddit groups such as ""suburban hell"". 

LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO LIVE IN THESE PLACES. 

Mixed use neighborhoods ARE the answer, but everytime time I see one attempted these days,  the choice of businesses in tgese neighborhoods are almost laughable. I am a strong believer in choosing the RIGHT businesses for a mixed use development to maximize its profitability. Out of all the businesses residents MUST get in their car to drive to on a regular basis, you choose a nail salon, a massage parlor, and a coffee shop; and you scratch your head when they fail from a profit standpoint?

Put businesses in the vicinity that people will (insert drum roll) ACTUALLY USE. Ex: a small grocery store where a mother can walk to with her children to grab some milk. A hardware store that a dad can send his teenage son to. A liquor store where couples could walk to and grab a bottle of wine to compliment dinner. A convenience store that a husband can go and pick up some rolls of tissue and dishwasher liquid because they ran out. A butcher shop (start giving life back to these forgotten professions). An auto shop, etc. Cater to the NEEDS first..then the wants.

Once you get a footing on those type of businesses,  THEN you can start to incorporate your pizza parlors, a coffee shop,  a bar, a nail salon, etc. 

People are TIRED of the isolation. They are tired of living in a bubble, getting in a moving bubble, and driving to another bubble. Its an ASS WAY OF LIVING. If the PEOPLE are listened to opposed to outdated profit margins,  developers will begin to see how much PROFIT they're leaving on the table.",19,1758366856.0,urbanplanning,11,1.0,False

1nlvg4u,https://i.redd.it/uidyko16zaqf1.jpeg,Review #11 Elijah Craig Barrel Proof C924,"Back with another review, this time away from the Buffalo Trace mash bottles from my past two reviews. Elijah Craig Barrel Proof is a staple release that has had some top bourbons of the year, and also a few duds recently. While the C923 gets a lot of praise, I haven’t really seen much love for the A125. Today, I’m trying the C924, and we’ll see how it stacks up.

Heaven Hill has been releasing Elijah Craig Barrel Proof for about 15 years now. The earlier releases seemed to all be at least 12 years old and at a bit of a higher proof. Post ~2020, the batches started to have lower ages, and we’re now all the way to single digit age statements on some batches, unfortunately. This has gotten a lot of people turned off to the brand recently, as the new batches just aren’t quite the same as the old. It seems like the releases with the older age statements and higher proofs usually get better reviews. This batch (C924) is a pretty high age and proof compared to some other recent releases, so I’d expect it to do well in my review.

Now to the details.

Mash bill: 78% corn, 12% malted barley, 10% rye.

Price: ~$70.00 with taxes.

Age Statement: 11 years. My understanding is that they all used to be 12 years but now vary between about 9-12.

ABV: 64.5%, Barrel Proof, obviously. 129 proof

Nose: Immediately I’m hit with a chocolate malt note, similar to a whopper or milk dud. I also get some pretty strong brown sugar and oak as the whiskey rests.

Palate: On the palate, the Kentucky hug is very noticeable. More like a Kentucky knockout. After getting past the high proof of the pour, I got some red fruit, specifically apples right off the bat. There was also some baking spices almost as a secondary note, and that chocolate malt brown sugar deep in the background. Every note was pretty bold though, most likely because of the proof.

Finish: This pour had a great mouthfeel and really coats the mouth, lending to a really long finish. It might be one of the longest and most enjoyable finishes I’ve had to date. The notes are a lot of the same with red apple, some spice, some chocolate, and a little oak. I do get a coffee note the longer this lingers.

Overall, this was a great pour. I found it to be super complex, incredibly deep and bold flavors, and an awesome finish. This is everything I think you can expect from a barrel proof bourbon. Seems like this version/release of the barrel proofs is solid!

I’m really happy PA gets these as I think I can see myself owning several of these bottles at one time depending on the release quality. I know the quality has allegedly dropped off in recent years but I would definitely keep my eyes out for new releases of the barrel proof line with positive reviews. I hear the B525 is pretty good, I might have to look around for one, once it hits stores here. 

I would rate this as a 7 on the T8KE scale. Really good, great even, but there is nothing that really blows me away.

Thanks for reading, cheers! If you made it all the way down here, let me know if there's bottles you would like me to review in the future, or what you think about this review in the comments!

1nlvfjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1nlvfjh/all_the_pretty_things/,All the Pretty Things,"I am a reclusive old man living alone in the Appalachian wilderness, and I’ve lived in my little cabin for the better part of 50 years without incident. However, recently, things have started showing up on my doorstep- and the contents are horrifying.

It started with a note. A sheet of notebook paper I found taped to my door one morning.

It read, “It’s the pretty things that matter,” scrawled in black ink in large lettering across the page. On the back, there was a Polaroid. An off-kilter photo of what looked like a chest or box surrounded by trees.

A bit confused and unsettled, I set the note and photo on my coffee table and went on about my day, journaling and reading. There’s not much to do in the woods of Appalachia, so my days were usually spent enjoying nature, hunting, and fishing.

So that’s what I did, I finished my chapter and journal entry, then set off into the forest, rifle on my shoulder and fishing rod in hand.

The woods were eerily silent this day, which, if you know anything about Appalachia, is not a good sign. I was confident with my rifle, though, and hiked on, following the path to the river that I’d taken a million times before.

However, halfway through the hike, I discovered something that had not been on the trail before: A bloodied doll head was nailed through the forehead into a towering pine that swayed with the wind, its body nowhere to be found. Below the head, etched into the bark with what I assumed was a pocket knife, the phrase, “isn’t she pretty?” jagged and messy.

Feeling the unease wash over me, I decided it was best I return home for the day. The forest remained silent as I trekked back to the cabin, and it felt as though a million eyes were on me with each step I took. I could feel the atmospheric pressure change as thunder clapped overhead and the first droplets of rain began to fall.

Making it back home, I locked up extra tight, placing a chair underneath my door handle and locking every window.

The storm raged that night, and the wind howled outside, rocking the cabin back and forth gently. I had slept with my rifle, being the paranoid recluse that I am, and because periodically throughout the night, I thought I could hear the sounds of footsteps pounding against my front porch- pacing back and forth along the tiny 4x5 space.

Life was brought to my fears when the next morning, I found a new gift at my doorstep: The tattered and dirty shirt that appeared to have belonged to a little girl, between the ages of 4 and 8.

In denial, I tried rationalizing the experience by telling myself the weather had blown the shirt onto the porch, the wind had swept it up and carried it miles just for it to settle directly on my front porch. An attempt for me to walk away from the situation.

However, that rationalization quickly crumbled when I picked up the shirt, and beneath it lay another Polaroid photo:

A little girl standing at a bus stop, oblivious. The same pink and purple butterflies on her shirt as the ones on the shirt I now held in my hands. On the back, in black Sharpie and neat handwriting was the phrase, “Isn’t she pretty?” with a smiley face underneath.

I immediately loaded up into my old Ford Ranger and made my way to the closest police station, presenting them with the evidence. Looking into their missing persons database, they found a match for the girl in the picture. Only she had gone missing over 30 years ago, and her case had gone cold after about 15 years.

I explained the events to the police, with the doll’s head and the photo of the chest that I had received two nights ago, and they told me everything I already knew about Appalachia: how people go missing up here by the thousands every year, and how an absurd number of the cases go unsolved. Nevertheless, they assured me they’d examine the Polaroid for fingerprints and get back to me if they found any clues.

Being a gun owner, I refused any police protection at my residence, and I myself assured them that I too would be keeping a close eye out for any suspicious-looking person lurking near my remote cabin.

When I returned home, everything was just as I left it. No signs of any kind of trespassing or vandalism. I stayed in again this night, wanting to be here in case any more gifts arrived on my doorstep.

While I was at my stove cooking that night, through the sound of my radio playing 70’s rock music, I heard the creeping footsteps again on my front porch.

I rushed to grab the rifle from my bedroom and came bursting through the front door to find the sight of a pale, sickly-thin man, crouched down and peering into my kitchen window, Polaroid camera strapped around his neck. He was completely nude and bald-headed, and once he saw me, he screeched like an animal before springing over the baluster.

I fired blind shots as he fled at inhuman speed into the woods, leaving shrubbery and branches shaking as he sprinted. I fired another shot into the forest in his direction and heard another screech, but the sprinting persisted. I leaped from the porch and chased as fast as I could through the dense forest, stumbling over roots and running into trees in the darkness.

I could no longer hear the footsteps, so I gave up and walked back to the cabin, defeated.

I did not sleep a wink that night. The whole evening was spent on my porch, waiting for him to come back. Next time, I would not miss. I waited until the sun came up, and no trace of the man returned.

Becoming fluent in hunting during my time here in these woods, my first idea was to search for his blood. I had heard him screech again; I could’ve at least grazed an arm, and I could work from that.

I searched the whole area and found no sign of blood anywhere.

Defeated, I returned to the cabin. I went into town that day and bought some trail cameras that I placed around the area and on my porch. I was not going to miss my opportunity to catch or kill this guy again.

Days came and went with no sign of the man. My trail cams caught nothing, and gifts stopped appearing on my doorstep. Days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. I had almost succumbed and settled back into my life of comfort and serenity alone on my mountain until one faithful morning.

A new gift was on my porch. Not only that, but doll heads were nailed to every tree surrounding the perimeter. It wasn’t just doll heads, either. Limbs were separated from the torsos and crudely nailed to the trees, making them look like dissected bodies.

The same message under each display:

“Isn’t she pretty?”

The new gift was a jewelry box, dusty and decaying. Inside were dozens of rusted and bloodied earrings, each one bearing some variation of a butterfly.

After this, things escalated faster than I could account for.

I took the jewelry box to the police station and yet again explained the situation to the local police chief. The earrings were taken in for DNA examination, and as the earrings were being removed, a new Polaroid was found underneath the pile.

It was me, asleep in my bed, completely unaware, taken from beyond my bedroom window.

The chief insisted I have police protection at my cabin, and this time I agreed. This man had managed to find the one blind spot in my trail cams, and now he was toying with me.

DNA testing takes anywhere between 24 and 72 hours, so once more, I returned to the cabin, officers at my rear.

As you’d imagine, it’s difficult for me to park my Ranger on my property, let alone two additional police cars. That being said, the officers had to park their cruisers on the dirt road at the end of the driveway. The two officers stayed in their cars the whole night, rendering them nearly useless. That’s what makes what happened next so frustrating.

It had started to storm again, and lightning strikes flooded the cabin with flashing light every few seconds. Something was off, though, the strikes seemed…out of sync with the storm.

I focused in on this and noticed that there would be three quick flashes of light after every big flash of light, and then there’d be thunder.

Lightning struck again, and in the living room window, the outline of the man came into view. Three flashes came from his face before the outside went dark again.

Once again, I ran outside, rifle in hand, but this time the man was gone completely, without a trace.

Immediately, I confronted the cops in their useless cars, demanding they help search the area. They dared to seem annoyed with me as we searched the woods in the pouring rain.

Finding nothing, the officers returned to their vehicles. By this point, it was around 4 in the morning, and the storm began to let up. Against my better judgment, I allowed myself rest.

I awoke to sunshine and birds singing, a stunning contrast to the previous night.

Stepping onto my porch, in place of a gift, I found dozens of Polaroids of myself arranged into the shape of a butterfly.

Right in the center of the collage, I found something that broke me.

My daughter, laughing as I pushed her on the swing. As happy as could be.

25 years ago, she had gone missing from our front yard as my wife and I worked around the house.

Her disappearance broke me and my wife apart, and we divorced soon after, leading me to move here, into this cabin.

I felt my heart break all over again, and I began to break down. I was absolutely grimaced to find that the police cars were no longer at the end of my driveway and were nowhere to be found.

I lost my mind. I stomped through the forest screaming at the top of my lungs for the man to reveal himself, for him to show himself to me, and to stop being such a coward.

The forest had grown silent again, aside from the sound of leaves rustling around me. The noise surrounded me as if something were running in circles around me, studying me. I couldn’t even discern where it ended, but when it did, it was immediately replaced with a single sound:

click

My shroud of sanity fell, and I fired shots wildly in all directions. I listened as the unnaturally fast footsteps raced off deeper into the forest, laughing like a banshee.

This was the last I saw of the man for a while. DNA evidence from the earrings came back as a match for 36 different missing children from the 80s and 90s. This time, a whole team came up to my little cabin and searched extensively for miles.

Unbelievably, a warrant was served for the search of the cabin itself, which I obliged, too tired to care.

The search went on for months, and nothing was found. I’d stare at the pictures of the man, naked on my trail camera, and burning hatred filled my heart. Murderous resentment that would keep me awake at night.

The last gift the man has left me was his box from the first Polaroid he ever gave me.

A traveler’s trunk that you’d see on a train, across the top, the phrase “All the pretty things.”

I opened it to find dozens of doll heads along with dismembered arms and legs made from hollow plastic. I found a variety of clothing, all with butterflies stitched into the fabric. But above all, I found pictures of dozens of little girls, none older than 12.

Blood speckled the top of the pile, and I wanted to throw up, staring into the case.

I kneeled there over the box, completely lost for words and in a trance for what felt like hours. The one thing that snapped me out of this state was when I heard the rustling of leaves off in the distance, followed by a sound that broke me:

So I had 3 teeth done which means extra tissue from the palate. This is my first gum grafting also. I've actually had no problems or pain in the grafted site but I've had many issues with my harvest area on my palate. 

The first day/night(9/15) I had massive bleeding hours after the procedure. I had to return to the office and get more stitches put in. That same night I had a copious amount of bleeding again but stemmed the flow after applying pressure for 30 mins. From then on it improved slowly but surely following the provided instructions. 

After a time the palate guard itself seemed to give me more issues. At first it fit like a glove but increasingly it feels more tight and makes my teeth ache. Plus the back edge of it puts pressure on a part of the palate that has a stitch running through it. As you go through the photos you can see how things progressed up to 9/19 and today, 9/20. There are time stamps but they may be out of order, dunno why they uploaded that way.

Anyways, I'd like to draw attention to the 9/18 and 9/19 photos which you can see with and w/o my palate guard. On 9/19 I took the opportunity to leave my guard out for a few hours to let things breathe a bit as i was instructed. Once I needed to eat again I put the guard back in but boy oh boy was it uncomfortable!! It took a couple hours to settle down but it felt like I just mashed my wound when putting the guard in. The tissues seemed to be doing well and getting pinker but since then it just seems redder and redder. I figured since there was no pain and it wasn't bleeding, just angry looking I'd leave my guard out over night which is also something the office recommended I try.

That brings us to the 9/20 photo. It ""looks"" worse but again, no pain, no bleeding. Despite it looking like it's shredded with holes where some of the stitching is, it actually feels like there's a solid, relatively smooth skin over everything. If anything it just feels a bit puffy, but again no pain, no pus or seepage. I'm questioning if I should put my guard back in or try eating w/o it. I'm afraid if I re-guard it's going to mash it in and do more harm than good. I had some coffee so far and had no issue drinking it(**not** hot btw). My dentists of course is not available and I don't see them until 9/30. I'm hoping there's some dental staff on here that has any advice.  Thank you!

EDIT: Just took another photo and it's looking much LESS red, starting to pink up more. Still wondering about using my guard though as I'm afraid it will do more harm than good.",1,1758366652.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

1nlv8u6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iloilo/comments/1nlv8u6/iloilo_where_every_citizen_is_a_watchdog/,Iloilo: Where Every Citizen Is a Watchdog,"When a friend from Manila visited Iloilo City, she did what many newcomers do: follow local media and join a few community Facebook pages. Within days, she was stunned. It was not just the charm of the city or its heritage streets that caught her attention. It was the way Ilonggos treated Facebook. For them, it was not just social media. It was a neighborhood watch, a people’s court, and a stage for city pride.

The first post she saw was about a “Badjao sighting.” In most big cities in Ph, such scenes are routine and hardly get a reaction. In Iloilo, it drew hundreds of comments, calls for deportation, and debates over social order. Soon she was seeing more: cars parked wrongly, teen brawls in public plaza, students jaywalking along Diversion Road. Within minutes, they went viral. Principals were summoned. Parents were scolded. Barangay officials stepped in. Nothing seemed too small to escape public scrutiny.

Curious, I dug into why the culture of community policing runs so deep in Iloilo.The roots go back centuries. Ilonggos have always valued banwa, the town or community, where everyone shares responsibility for peace and order. Under Spanish rule, Iloilo became one of the most Hispanicized areas in the Visayas, governed through systems like the cabeza de barangay. In the American period, its role as a colonial administrative hub strengthened civic order and ties between citizens and authority. Over centuries, these layers built a tradition of community watchfulness that has carried into the digital age.

Today, this instinct has found its sharpest tool in Facebook. If you think Iloilo is just the “City of Love,” log on. Online, Ilonggos turn into vigilant guards, fiercely patrolling the feeds for anything that threatens order or pride. They’ve mastered what I call the “report, share, defend” reflex. And make no mistake, it doesn’t end with defending. Public officials are fair game. Long before flood-control projects became headline controversies, Ilonggos were already roasting leaders in full view of the community. Unlike other cities where silence is bred by fear, Iloilo thrives on a culture of accountability rooted in collective conscience. Here, calling out wrongdoing isn’t rebellion, it’s tradition.

That is why posts about DPWH and its Ungka flyover contractors get absolutely shredded online. Every bolt, beam, and traffic cone is apparently under 24/7 Ilonggo surveillance. Remember “the attorney with an iPhone 16 and a car” going viral like it was a national crisis, or Coffee Break versus YoBab taking over the internet? even small infractions, like a car parked incorrectly, can make headlines. Nothing escapes the Ilonggos online. 

Research shows that Iloilo tops the charts in Facebook penetration rate in the Philippines. And boy, does it show. For Ilonggos, Facebook isn’t just where you post vacation photos. It is a neighborhood watch, a people’s court, and a parade of local pride in one platform. Soft-spoken offline, Ilonggos go full vigilante online, ready to roast, report, and defend at the drop of a post. To outsiders it may look like overzealous policing. To Ilonggos, it is simply love of community translated into the digital age.

1nluz3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nluz3m/which_types_of_electric_kettles_are_on_the_market/,Which types of electric kettles are on the market?,"Hey everyone! I've been using electric kettles for years, and I thought I'd share my experience and knowledge about the different types available. After trying various models and doing extensive research, I've become somewhat of an electric kettle enthusiast (yes, that's a thing!).

First off, let me tell you why I switched from a stovetop kettle to an electric one. The convenience is unreal - faster heating times, automatic shut-off, and precise temperature control. If you're still using a traditional kettle, you're seriously missing out.

Here are the main types I've encountered:

1. Basic Electric Kettles
These are your standard, no-frills models. They're perfect if you just want to boil water quickly. They usually have a single switch and auto-shutoff feature. I started with one of these, and they're great for their simplicity.

2. Variable Temperature Kettles
These are my personal favorite. You can set specific temperatures for different types of tea or coffee. Green tea at 175°F? Perfect! French press coffee at 200°F? No problem! I found some great options at https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle that really changed my hot beverage game.

3. Gooseneck Kettles
Coffee enthusiasts, this one's for you! The long, curved spout gives you precise control over water flow. They're essential for pour-over coffee. While they're a bit pricier, the control is worth it if you're serious about your coffee.

4. Glass Electric Kettles
These look amazing on your counter and let you watch the water boil (which is oddly satisfying). They often come with LED lights that make the water glow while heating. I recently got one from https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle and it's become a conversation starter in my kitchen.

5. Double-Wall Kettles
These maintain the water temperature longer and stay cool to touch on the outside. Super safe if you have kids around!

6. Smart Kettles
The newest addition to the market - these connect to your phone and can be controlled remotely. You can start boiling water while still in bed! Some even integrate with smart home systems.

Important features to consider:
- Capacity (typically 1-1.7 liters)
- Power (1500W is standard for quick boiling)
- Material (stainless steel, glass, or plastic)
- Keep-warm function
- Water level indicator
- Filter for hard water areas

Pro tip: If you're into specialty coffee or tea, invest in a variable temperature kettle. The difference in taste when using the right water temperature is mind-blowing.

Price-wise, you can find basic models for around $20, while premium smart kettles can go up to $150+. I'd say the sweet spot is around $50-80 for a good quality variable temperature kettle.

Almost everyone, at some point in life, begins to feel the effects of aging or a busy lifestyle. You may wake up with stiff joints, feel pain in your knees after walking, or notice that your bones are not as strong as before. Some people even experience constant tiredness, dehydration, or a lack of energy during the day. These problems are not only frustrating but also reduce the joy of everyday living.

📌 order here: 
Joints, bones, and hydration are three key parts of overall health. Without strong joints, it becomes hard to move comfortably. Without healthy bones, even small falls can lead to serious injuries. Without proper hydration and minerals, the body feels drained, making it difficult to stay active and productive. This combination of problems affects young people, athletes, workers, and especially older adults.

📌 order here: https://amzn.to/46gqaqE

The sad truth is that these issues do not appear overnight. They build slowly with time. Poor diet, stress, lack of exercise, or even too much physical strain can make the body weaker. By the time many people notice the signs, they already struggle with pain, low mobility, or frequent fatigue. But the good news is that natural solutions exist. Supplements designed for bones, joints, and hydration can help restore balance and give back energy.

📌 order here: https://amzn.to/4gBMC10

The challenge is choosing the right supplement. Some products focus more on joints, others on bone strength, and some on overall hydration and energy. Making the right decision depends on your personal needs and lifestyle. That’s why it is important to compare and understand what each product offers. Let’s take a closer look at three top options from Amazon and explore how they can solve these common health problems.

Product Overviews and Benefits

1. Mobility Collagen Peptides Powder
This supplement is designed mainly for joint health, flexibility, and mobility. It provides 10g of collagen peptides per serving, which are known to support cartilage, strengthen connective tissues, and reduce stiffness. Along with collagen, it contains glucosamine, chondroitin, and hyaluronic acid, a powerful trio that works together to lubricate joints, protect cartilage, and improve bone support. It also includes Vitamin C to naturally boost collagen production in the body.



One of the advantages of this powder is its versatility. It dissolves easily in coffee, tea, or juice, so you don’t have to change your daily routine. People often report improvements in skin elasticity, stronger nails, and better hair growth in addition to joint comfort. This makes the supplement useful not just for mobility but also for beauty and aging support.

📌 order here: https://amzn.to/48oKvvd

2. New Chapter Calcium Supplement
This supplement focuses on bone density and bone strength. Unlike many traditional calcium tablets, it uses organic red marine algae as the source of calcium. This natural source is easier for the body to absorb and is supported by scientific studies. It also contains Vitamin D3 and Vitamin K2, which help direct calcium to the bones where it is needed most, rather than leaving it in the bloodstream.


The product also includes magnesium and over 70 trace minerals, which are essential for long-term bone health. The slim tablets are easy to swallow, and the supplement is vegan, gluten-free, kosher, and non-GMO, making it suitable for a wide audience. It is especially recommended for people who are at risk of osteoporosis, older adults, or those who want to maintain strong bones throughout life.

📌 order here: https://amzn.to/46gqaqE

3. Key Nutrients Multivitamin Electrolytes Powder
This supplement is focused on hydration, energy, and overall wellness. After physical activity or long hours in the sun, the body loses electrolytes like sodium, magnesium, and potassium. This powder replaces them effectively, preventing fatigue, dehydration, and muscle cramps. It also contains 18 essential vitamins and minerals, making it more than just an electrolyte drink.

The powder is sugar-free, calorie-free, and comes in a refreshing lemon-lime flavor. It mixes easily with water, hot or cold, and provides a clean energy boost without the side effects of sugary drinks. It is made in the USA by a veteran-founded company, which emphasizes quality and transparency. For athletes, busy workers, or anyone who wants steady energy during the day, this supplement is an excellent choice.

Which One Should You Choose?

Each of the three supplements has unique strengths, and the right choice depends on what you need most. Let’s break it down clearly:

1. Best for Joints and Flexibility – Mobility Collagen Peptides Powder
This product is ideal if you often feel pain in your knees, stiffness in your joints, or limited mobility. The blend of collagen, glucosamine, chondroitin, and hyaluronic acid gives complete joint support. It not only improves flexibility but also aids in recovery after exercise and supports healthier skin and nails. For people who want both joint care and beauty benefits, this supplement is a great investment.

📌 order here: https://amzn.to/48oKvvd

2. Best for Bone Strength and Density – New Chapter Calcium Supplement
If your biggest concern is bone weakness or the risk of osteoporosis, this is the best choice. Its organic calcium source is more natural and effective, and the added Vitamin K2 and D3 ensure that calcium is directed to the bones, not left in soft tissues. This supplement is perfect for older adults, women after menopause, or anyone who wants strong, lasting bones for life.
📌 order here: https://amzn.to/46gqaqE

3. Best for Hydration and Energy – Key Nutrients Multivitamin Electrolytes Powder
For people who live active lifestyles, exercise frequently, or experience dehydration and fatigue, this powder is the top pick. It replenishes electrolytes, provides vitamins, and keeps the body hydrated without sugar or artificial ingredients. It is also budget-friendly because one container offers 90 servings, making it cost-effective for daily use.

📌 order here: https://amzn.to/4gBMC10

➤ To summarize:

Choose Mobility Collagen Peptides Powder if you need joint flexibility and beauty support.

Choose New Chapter Calcium Supplement if you want stronger bones and long-term bone density.

Choose Key Nutrients Multivitamin Electrolytes Powder if hydration, energy, and endurance are your main goals.

Today's plan is to pick up books about minimalism from the library today, as well as doing some tidy up in the name of said minimalism. I visited a spa on Thursday and it was so nurturing.

1nlunux,https://www.reddit.com/r/ACL/comments/1nlunux/part_2_therapist_mental_health_gets_acl/,Part 2: Therapist (Mental Health) gets ACL reconstruction.,"It's about 22 hours since the start of my surgery, here's a recap and some of my perspective on the experience. 

I'm a coffee drinker, so no coffee was a definite thumbs down. But that's just how it goes. My check-in was fine. I was rather surprised when met with the instructions of ""clothes off, including underclothes"" when changing into the surgical gown. Not sure if it's due to the variety of underwear lengths folks wear which might get too close to probe sites or just a policy to keep from ruining clothes on accident, no clothes just robe (and grippy socks). The rest of prep included a sterilization wipe down and nasal sterilization (think COVID test with puffy alcohol drenched swabs). The body wipes left me kinda sticky and the swabs were FRAGRANT but both experiences are way better than the types of infections they work to avoid. Just as I finished that process the suggestion came in and signed the leg, and the Anaesthesiologist came in to begin the process for going under and place a nerve block. 

The block was described as likely to leave me ""tingly and my leg would feel heavy."" After being wheeled into the OR I let the technician know I didn't feel those things, but he assured me not everyone does. Then sleepy mask! By all accounts, the surgery went well. Unfortunately I woke up to learn I was not of the lucky few who just didn't feel the nerve block side effects, it just hadn't fully worked. Pain was probably an 8 or 9/10. Not the best way to wake up. At first the nurse just pushed the meds I was going to get anyway, it's gotta be fairly common people wake up on pain. But after a couple dosage increases of that they told my wife I shouldn't still be in that kind of pain with a nerve block placed, so they called the Anaesthesiologist. Another block was placed which did the trick.

Leading up to the surgery, it felt strange to think I would have someone drilling into my bones AND leave shortly after. It was strange. 4.5 hours after arriving at the hospital I was in a wheelchair being pushed down to my wife's car. Wild.

Getting in the car was fine, the drive was fine, getting out of the car was fine. Stairs on the other hand, stairs are stupid 😆. Honestly the fact that they are like the first thing you have to negotiate as you learn/relearn how to use crutches is just cruel.

At home the pain is now anywhere between a 5 and 7/10, depending on the distance from my last iron med. Using the bathroom, getting up from laying down and changing my clothes are all tricky things I'm just now starting to get the hang of. What I find hardest is probably sleep. I'm a side sleeper and all I can do but is sleep in my back. I also need to shift my leg occasionally to help mitigate the pain. Additionally challenging is my instinct to bend. I think it's the feeling of stiffness, but there are times where my brain is convinced the only way to relieve the discomfort is bending. But doctors orders and the presence of my no bend brace means all I can do is shift. 

So there's a lot to get used to. I'm pretty tired. But, I also am already noticing it's a little less painful. The challenging things are a little easier. I still rely HEAVILY on others to get around. I'm hopeful more independence is close at hand.

The closest one to where we actually live is a 9 hour drive away and it's ruined Dunkin coffee for us (Starbucks, to us, isn't worth the price).

So my question for everyone is, is there a widely available coffee that could be found somewhere like Walmart or Target that's comparable to Scooters? We miss it so much! I'm going to buy her some at home Scooters as a Christmas gift but don't want to get any before that.

Alt er selvfølgelig subjektivt men bløde sidepladser, bagværk af god kvalitet (tebirkes, pain au chocolat) og selvfølgelig gode bønner og ordentligt udstyr.

Bonus hvis stedet er tæt på natur eller vandet.

Nogle eksempler:

1. Prolog Coffee (Marguerite Vibys Plads)
2. Impact Roasters (Valby Station)
3. Roast Coffee (Pladehals Allé)
4. Riccos (Kaktus Towers)
5. Coffee Collective (Carlsberg Byen)

Den sidste lever muligvis ikke op til mine ønsker, men super placering!

Andre bud?

Det må også gerne være lidt uden for byen, så længe stedet er godt og/eller det kan kombineres med en gåtur/natur (evt. med offentlig transport)
