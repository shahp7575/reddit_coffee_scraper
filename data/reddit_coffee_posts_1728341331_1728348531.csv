I don't work. I have a few last courses left for my degree and I am attending lectures about 3 times a week. I live with my partner of 4 years (44M) who works from home. I do all of the cooking and cleaning in the house, even now when pregnant, but my partner does take me out to eat multiple times a week which helps cause I don't have to cook as often. He also told me that at any point I want we can hire someone to clean the house 1-2x  a week  (not sure how much it would help as my partner is incredibly messy and I basically need to follow him around all day long if I want the house to be clean - he literally leaves cabinets open , unfolds all of his clothes in the closet in order to reach the shirt he wants and leaves it like that, leaves hairs in sink after shaving, makes kitchen look like a batterfiled after each time he has a snack which is about 100 times a day etc). He also told me many times we can get a nanny/babysitter when we get a baby so I can  have some time for me when the baby is there etc. But as of now, I was doing everything in the house still , at 31 weeks pregnant.

His parents arrived last night from another country to stay for two weeks . I like them very much and they are lovely to be around and I enjoy their company. They arrived late at night and I spent all day yesterday cleaning in preparation for their arrival, going shopping for things they needed with my partner and cooking food for when they arrived. We went to bed very late ( about 4am), and today I woke up late , about 2-3 hours after everyone else. When I got up the breakfast dishes were still on the table but I didn't mind as it was really not a big deal , so after I ate and had coffee I emptied clean dishes from the washer and reloaded it with all of our breakfast dishes. I really don't mind at all , I was just surprized that noone did it and instead waited for 2 hours for me to do it. Then at one point my partner asked me if I want to cook today or eat out so I opted for eating out so we did it. On the way back from the restaurant my partner went to the gym while I went with my in-laws to do grocery shopping, where they asked me if I am cooking tomorrow. I told them I have lectures tomotrow so we will likely order delivery instead and I of course told them that they can feel at home and are very welcome to cook in out kitchen ( of courde if they feel like it). Then at one point back at home tonight my partner asked me again if I am cooking tomorrow. He was very understanding when I said I probably won't have energy between lectures, pregnancy, having been sick recently etc. 

The reason I am making this post is because I am a bit surprized with the expections from all of them when it comes to me cooking. I am not at all mistreated and noone says anything negative when I do opt out of doing it , but feels like they would not be against me cooking every day for all of us if I was ok with it. Maybe it is a cultural thing ( my partner and I are from different countries), but I had assuemd they were coming over to see us and also to help in the house now that I am pregnant as that is what my mother would do ( unfortunately I  lost her last year to cancer). 

I want to be hospitable and I really like these people and I know noone will bully me into doing more than I can.  Any advice? How often shoukd I cook in the next few weeks?",1,1728348323.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

","So I got on the scale today and surprisingly I am now 238lbs at 7:55pm! I started on September 4, on  5.0, at 260lbs! Last Wednesday I was up'd to  7.5.  I didnt know what to expect but I felt the same.  Thus far, I havent had any of the issues/side effects people have complained of ( Thank God!)  but I also think it fair to credit that to a lot of things that are part of my daily habits.  For instance, VITAMINS YALL! FR FR !  I take Liquid vitamins everyday (Tropical Oasis.. thank me later!) I take Calcium Magnesium, the Joint Complete and the Women's Premium MultiVitamin! Yes they can be costly but the way I see it is you can pay for your health now in $$ or later with pain and disease! Period! Ok!  I have been taking them off and on for about 4 years now.  Back story, my weight has alway flucuated.  I'd go up 60-90lbs, then lose it for about 3 years ... gain ...lose ...repeat.  So when the pandemic hit I was already doing keto and started taking my vitamins again.  I switched to the Tropical Oasis brand b/c on the keto diet even with taking electrolytes, making and taking seamoss gel, adaptagen mushroom powders, collagen powders and eating avocados everyday Id still get really bad muscle cramps/charlie horses.  I switched my vitamin brand to Tropical Oasis.  It's THE BEST and Ive been using it ever since.  I find it especially helpful while on Zepbound too.  Since Im not eating as much, Im getting less nutrients even when I add my supplements (Superfood 10 mix mushroom powder and seamoss powder with burdock and bladderwrack)  to my coffee tea/etc.  Also, I notice I can take a dump easily 2x a day when I take my vitamins.  I think b/c they are liquid and absorb 98% into the body than pills 18% absorbtion rate...the vitamins really  help with bowel movements.  Trust me I've been experimenting with things that help me take a dump and this has been the most consistent.  When I skip my vitamins, I can't poop that day... no matter how much salad and seafood I may eat! Any whosits... try the vitamins.. 2nd thing is... I am a runner.. well right now Im a jogger who's committed to getting  back into running...lol.  I make it my  business to walk to and from my local neighborhood track and jog 20 mins with the Nike Run App at least 4x per week.  Listen, I used to run a 10 min mile but right now Im at a 15min mile but I dgaf b/c when I started jogging in June I was doing an18 min mile... the point is..... excercing is making me stronger and faster.  On top of that it will help me keep my butt and big legs! Im African American, 48yr old woman so ya know... we be thick thick!  I've been increasing my jogging time by 2/3 mins with each month that I  consistently go 4x per week.... so there's that. Lastly, about the smoking .... I havent seen anybody on here post about smoking weed and taking the Z shot so let me add this to my post.  I've been smoking weed for over 20yrs off and on, mostly on! At first I wasnt sure if it was going to help or hinder my progress on this but I decided to give it a try and It's no big deal.  I dont get the munchies and never really did.  Getting munchies mostly depends on the strain of weed youre smoking. So, smoking while on Z has not hindered my progress... Thank God!🙏 I think the biggest thing for me right now  is  that Z is helping with me  NOT SNACK at night and sticking to the cut off time for eating mainly b/c Im just not hungry or thinking about food.  I've  was doing all of the ""things""🏋️‍♀️🏃‍♀️ to lose weight and could not get and keep off 5lbs.  It was a vicious cycle and now look... down 22lbs 1st month! Im excited to see where Ill be at the end of the year! Yay! Hope this was helpful to someone.  I think when we see others lose weight fast we want to know what they are doing so yeah Im doing  all the ""things"" 🏋️‍♀️🏃‍♀️ and still eating occasional treats like a burger for lunch, no fries with diet soda, a little bag of chips here and there. For my bday I had a crumbl cookie and some cake and it was soooo sweet I could barely stand it! I'd say 85% of my food is veggies and proteins and taking good stuff. I may eat a cup of rice with my food from time to time but Im mindful of how it turns to glucose so like... I eat it if I have a taste for it.  I eat mostly 2 good meals a day, Ive never been a breakfast person.  I may have some trail mix if I want something sweet in between but that's basically what I've been doing the past 4 1/2 weeks! TBC.... Also, do not be coming up over here trying to judge me telling me what I can and cant do b/c I will definately cuss you out... period!😒 This post is for inspirational purposes only and you should consult w your doctor before trying new excercises and taking new anythings!

41-Year-Old Single Father Looking for Connection

Hey there! I’m a 41-year-old single dad to two amazing kids. Life keeps me busy, but I’m ready to carve out some time for myself and hopefully meet someone special, whether it’s virtual or in person.

I value honesty, kindness, and good conversation. I’m looking for someone who’s down-to-earth, enjoys both deep chats and light-hearted moments, and understands the balance of parenting and personal time. Whether it’s grabbing a coffee, a virtual date, or enjoying an adventure together, I’m open to where this could lead.

If you’re interested in getting to know each other, drop me a message!

1fyn69d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1fyn69d/aio_for_falling_out_of_love_with_my_wife/,AIO for falling out of love with my wife,"My wife (33F) had a beautiful baby girl 18 months and she is the light of my life, however our marriage has been a struggle to say the least. I have tried my best to be a present and attentive parent, not wanting to follow the stereotype of man who pushes everything onto his wife. My wife is a stay-at-home mum and I work 8-4 in a fairly high stress but well paying job, working through lunch everyday to make sure I’m home an hour early to support. Most days I make breakfast and dinner for everyone, do all the dishes, I do the weekly menu, food shopping, handle all the bills, taxes, cars, outside maintenance, plan outings, and assist with all the cleaning outside the kitchen. The only thing I dont help with is laundry, mainly because I “don’t do it right”, but I will obviously help without prompt if I see things piling up. My wife is the main caregiver, spending all her time with our daughter and im cognizant of this and try to take her as soon as I come in the door, take her for morning coffee runs or swim, music lessons, to the grocery store or walks, anything to give me wife some time to herself.  My alone time is two weekly one hour therapy sessions because im currently suffering from major depression and anxiety, with frequent suicidal ideation and self-harm. Considering that im high functioning, I look after myself physically I try to keep an outwardly positive attitude and keep up at work and at home, but by 9:30 im emotionally and mentally exhausted and just collapse into bed.  
  
My wife has never been super emotional warm, and always the perfectionist and I feel like its just gotten worse after our daughter. Nothing I can do is “right” and no matter the decision I make im criticized or derided. We’ll agree to a plan and if I follow it then im being heartless and not caring and if I dont then im going against what we agreed on and not supporting her enough. If I get out of bed and hold our daughter for hours so everyone else can get some sleep, then im not looking after myself well enough to keep my job, and if I dont, then im not supporting the family well enough. If I put her down to bed by myself as my wife is out, then the next day I get told that she cant trust me because I didnt wake up when she came in, how can she trust me to hear our daughter. If I ever do something for myself, even getting a glass of water or coffee without asking, then im selfish and not caring, if I put others first then I need to stop trying to be the better person all the time (when I brought up that I thought we agreed to put the other first when we got married I was told she didn’t agree to that in her vows). The main topic at therapy has been how I always put others first and never give myself a break with a chronic feeling of never being good enough, and im open and honest about these communications with my wife. We’ve also had a lot of conversations about how disconnected I feel and her response is that im just not a priority to her right now. We havent had sex before she was born but at this point I don’t care, I would like to feel like she wants to hold my hand or even give me a hug but unless I reach out there’s nothing.  
  
For the first 9 months I just stuck everything out and got on, everyone was tired and stressed and we have no family support so I just sucked it up. Neither of us are particularly good at taking time for ourselves and im sure this made it worse. Eventually I started to push back on the being put-down and told to shut-up and being told im useless, this has just been met with questions about my attitude or saying I need to give her grace because of how tired she is, which I have. We talk about how disconnected we are but every time I reach out it’s rebuffed, gifts are met with “why did you waste your money”, ive arranged babysitters and dates to be met with “why are we here this is pointless”. I arranged multiple days out and multiple mothers days and for my troubles I got a card (no gift) on our anniversary saying “sorry I dont appreciate you more”. Recently I proposed we skip doing chores during a nap so we can spend sometime just us and was told no way. When I pointed our there’s always chores, there will always be more chores and its probably just going to get worse as time goes on, I was told that if we got our chores done faster then there would be time for us. Im sick of just being snapped at, told im useless and how im not a priority and she has no mental capacity for me. She’s a wonderful mother, truly incredible but I just feel like im being left to rot. All I do is make money and give her a break. When I ask for time to myself im told my 15 minute commute to work is all the time I need, I cant tell you the last time I had 20 minutes to myself at home, its probably been 5 months since I did anything social outside the house. When I ask for time out im met with “well when do I get out”, I recently bought myself a new game after being told for weeks by her I should, and when I did I was asked “well what do I get”, not like I even get a chance to play it, im lucky if I get 15 minutes in a nap where I dont have things that need to be done, if I sit-down for even a moment with something that could be done I get asked if “im enjoying myself”  
  
At this point I feel like ive fallen out of love, im just pushed around all the time and im giving my all for my family and I love seeing my daughter grow into a wonderful person, but I feel completely untethered and supported. I want to propose marriage counseling but honestly im not even sure if its too late, there’s only so many times I can be met with cruel comments before im checked out, im trying to turn into the marriage and be open and honest about how im feeling, but im just not a priorty I guess.",2,1728347444.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

She immediately recognized me as the man who’d killed her husband.

“I was hoping we could talk for a minute,” I replied.

“No, thank you,” I waved away the offer, “That won't be necessary.""

She squeezed my hands compassionately.

“You’re a good man,” Mrs. Duncan said, “But there’s nothing you could’ve done to save him that night. You need to let your guilt go.”

“But…,” I started to protest but she cut me off.

“I’m serious,” she insisted, “He was going to die one way or another.”

“What?” Her comment confused me.

Whew, here we go with Part 2--even longer, sorry--with **Daphnedil, Betrothed, Maid Marian, Speed Racer,** and **Bellano**! Prepare yourselves for a lot of gushing, because I absolutely ADORE most of these. I simply cannot say it loud enough or often enough: [Cirrus Parfum](https://cirrusparfum.com/) is a house that absolutely deserves recognition! IMO, Cirrus's fragrances have all the creativity, variety, whimsy, value, and willingness to take risks that make indie perfume so compelling, but also the elegance, performance, refinement, and sophistication of niche perfumes. Much like Sunsphere Scents, this is a house where I am committed to sampling literally everything they put out that doesn't heavily feature ingredients I'm sensitive to. (And no, I'm not getting any compensation for this review, I bought all these fragrances at full retail price)

Oh, and for those of y'all that overlooked them for being all EDPs, they offer oils now too, so...go get some samples!

# Daphnedil

Woah, this is YELLOW! It's been a long time since I've smelled a daffodil, but it's INSTANTLY recognizable here. Yellow florals are definitely rare, at least among the fragrance houses I've explored; only Olympic Orchids' **Golden Cattleya** comes to mind, and that one has a lot of other stuff going on that does not work for me at all. **Daphnedil**, however, is absolutely pure yellow flowers to my nose--there's kind of a buttery (or maybe ""margarine-y"") quality, creamy and a little bit savory, with a touch of dusty pollen. It doesn't do the *curly-sweet honey-apricot seductive-narcotic-funereal vibe* of a white floral (jasmine, lily, etc.) nor the *round stuffy-powdery peppery-soapy vibe* of a pink floral (rose, carnation, etc.), nor the *bubbly dewy-bright coy-herbaceous sweet nectar vibe* of a purple floral (lilac, violet, etc.). This is lines and angles, waxy-firm and smooth, dusty yet mouth-watering. YELLOW!

Which, I know daphnes are NOT, but I also don't know what daphnes really smell like, so it's hard to parse out what they might be adding to the daffodils here.

It's also tugging at some childhood memory that I can't quite retrieve; was there a lotion or a shampoo that my mother used that smelled like this? Were daffodils her favorite flower? Did we have daffodils in our garden and did I spend time crawling among them before my memory was fully developed? I don't know, but smelling this is like twanging a string that connects back to some deep deep memory. I keep wanting to associate the scent with the idea of ""lotion"", though, and I'm not sure why.

Anyway, this is a very clean and feminine scent with excellent longevity and projection. It gets sweeter as it dries, and less yellow--less savory-buttery and pollen-dusty and less recognizable as a specific type of flower. It feels delicate, despite its performance. It puts me in mind of spring in a nice suburb where the climate isn't too wet and the winters aren't too cold. I am enjoying it, even though it's not really my vibe. I kind of want to layer it with something wetter and dirtier--oh, I bet this would layer really nicely with Sunsphere's **Lawn Girl** to make me feel like I'm walking through a suburban neighborhood in spring, admiring everyone's gardens.

# Betrothed

This is another one where the notes had me feeling dubious, because rose can easily go cloying, soapy, or grandmotherly. But I picked it because I had faith in Zoey's skill, and I'm SO glad I did!

Yes, this IS a rose scent, there is no mistaking that. But I immediately recognize peppercorn, some sheer woods, a dry musk, and a subtle vanillic sweetness underneath it all, which come together to elevate the rose into something that feels fresh, sexy-romantic, and a little bit wild! I once lived in a house with a couple of absolutely FERAL rose bushes flanking the front steps. They grew so tall that they almost pulled the gutter off the porch roof, with stems as thick as my big toes, thorns as tough as nails and as sharp as razors, and obscene flame-colored blooms that were practically incandescent. THAT is the kind of rose that this fragrance puts me in mind of!

The peppercorn really steals the spotlight for the first couple hours, then grudgingly cedes it to the wood and dry musk, but by the end of the day, the vanillic sweetness is what stands out the most. 12 hours in and the rose is a ghost, and the peppercorn a distant memory, but the sweetness remains with just enough of the musk to keep it warm and interesting.

This is kind of the foil to Sunsphere Scents' **Candoro Marble**, I think. Where Candoro Marble is a cool-minty dry woody rose, this is a warm-spicy sweet woody rose. I love them both, and that's saying something because I don't normally think of myself as enjoying rose fragrances! This is a surprise favorite.

# Maid Marian

I have only been to a renaissance faire once, but I LOVED it, so seeing the notes on this got me really excited. And what do ya know, this really nails the vibe!

Maid Marian paints a wonderfully vivid picture: I can smell hay strewn about the place, honey from the mead I am drinking, classic incense mingling with the smell of fire pits, and a FASCINATING rose that smells clean and dirty at the same time--there's something almost ""barnyard"" or ""cat pee"" happening with it that really evokes a rural country setting and maybe proximity to livestock. I think it might be patchouli, or maybe civet, but it feels like it's ""attached"" to the rose, rather than separate notes like the honey, hay, and incense. But it's also a pretty slightly-soapy rose that adds a whimsical feminine touch. It's overall a fairly sweet fragrance; there are elements that remind me of Solstice Scents' **Solstice Kyphi** (mainly the incense with honey/beeswax), but where that fragrance can be a bit heavy and cloying, Maid Marian remains light and pleasant.

On the dry-down, the rose and barnyard fade first, leaving sweet honey, hay, and incense. Eventually those notes fade a bit, too, but reveal that that earthy patchouli-laden rose didn't actually vanish--by the end of the day, the scent has returned to the balance it opened with, just much quieter and fuzzier. It does last all day, but not into the next one.

While it does evoke a hot summer night at a renaissance faire, it actually feels like it would be appropriate in cooler weather, too. I'm glad that Zoey is moving it from a limited summer release to be part of the general catalog, because I can fully see myself wearing this in every season!

# Speed Racer

I blind-bought a 10 mL of this during Cirrus's end of summer close-out sale just before the summer scents were retired, so I was relieved to find that I love the scent! **Speed Racer** absolutely nails the vibe of a brash tomboy who drives a vintage muscle car that she restored herself, and gets her kicks by leaving all the self-described car guys in the dust. Like, you just know she's added all kinds of aftermarket modifications and a hidden switch that she flips for a speed boost. Even off the road, she's a badass who'll drink everyone under the table and break the wrist of any guy who tries getting handsy with her.

...which is really nothing like *me*, but a girl can daydream, right?

This might be a challenging scent for some, because there are some powerfully-photorealistic notes of oil, gasoline, vintage car exhaust (the kind without a catalytic converter), tire rubber, and hot asphalt. I happen to love those smells, but I'm weird like that. However there's also a nice sweet cherry bubblegum, and the very specific scent of the leather interior of a car from the '90s or older. Almost 20 years ago, I very briefly drove a used Saab 900 Turbo with leather seats, and this smells like that. A very particular leather note that is different from leather jackets or leather-upholstered furniture.

The only thing that keeps this fragrance from perfection, IMO, is that I think it needs more bubblegum. If this had a potent photorealistic bubblegum like Mythpunk's **Bubblegum Puff**, I would swoon!

Also, speaking of Mythpunk, this kind of fills the hole left by the absence of **Babygirl** in my life--it's something I can wear when I know I'm going to be getting my hands dirty fixing machines at work, or when I just want to feel like Tank Girl.

# Bellano

I remember reading the notes on this one and thinking, ""this looks like something I'd like""...but I was NOT prepared to be greeted by own spirit in fragrance form!

My train of thought when first smelling this was basically the psychic equivalent of mashing keys on a keyboard. I am in the presence of the Triple Goddess (maiden, mother, crone). There is a young softness--ethereal slightly-indolic jasmine, gentle cool vanilla; mature stability--subtle sweet coffee, dry earthy lavender; and something wise and ancient and earthy, like a fog-shrouded forest island in a river or lake, that is only accessible by rowboat. Yet these elements are not *separate*--my attention doesn't move from individual note to individual note, they are all woven together into a singular gestalt that hits me straight in the amygdala, calling forth a very specific memory of my 20s:

>*It's a misty, but not too chilly, morning in East Oakland, California. The sun has just passed out of ""rising"" and into being fully ""up"". It has burned away enough of the fog to reveal the clear blue sky, but not quite enough to dispel its shimmering halo that wreathes the world in a gauzy soft-focus halo.*

>*I'm sitting on the trunk of a car in the parking lot outside the converted warehouse apartments where I live with a dozen or so close friends--a disreputable troupe of anarchist noise musicians, nerdy retro gear junkies, dreadlocked neo-hippies, gold-hearted metalheads, and indie-rap savants. I'm flanked by two or three others, and we are the last holdouts of a wild-but-typical party from the night before. We're sipping cheap mochas from a bodega down the street, and the scent of hand-rolled cigarettes mixes with the narcotic aroma of jasmine and lavender growing from the flower boxes that line the fence around the parking lot.*

>*I have transcended exhaustion into the blearily-poetic delirium that is only accessible to vital and vigorous 20-somethings in the sleep-deprived beer-soaked aftermath of a ""rager"". I feel hollowed out, disconnected from all concerns about the past and future, solely present in the Now™, alive and awake to the gorgeous filth and fetid glamor of the concrete jungle I call home.*

I checked the notes and materials list for this fragrance and I'm 90% sure that the hint of old cigarette smoke I'm getting is just a quirk of my nose or olfactory processing. Something about how the coffee and lavender are interacting, I think. But whatever it is, it's adding a sort of dirtiness to this that I ADORE--dirty pretty things/pretty dirty things are an essential component of my vibe, and this is the only fragrance other than Mythpunk's **Changeling** that has really managed to nail that for me.

This is the ONE, I think. The end-all, be-all of signature scents for me. My essence, in a bottle. If I could only wear one fragrance for the rest of my life, it would be Bellano. It is very all-season appropriate and all-occasion appropriate. I cannot think of a situation where this perfume would be the wrong choice for me. It may not elicit such a passionate love-reaction in everyone, but for me, this is heaven.

Usually, I do the following:

- Fill the water up to just below the valve, without covering it
- Add coffee to the filter without pressing, leveling it with a spoon
- Use medium heat until all the coffee has come out

What should I correct? Are there any additional tips to consider?

Also, I saw on the moka’s leaflet that the valve should be “pulled out,” but it’s very stiff! As an Italian, I deserve to emigrate, haha.",3,1728346769.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

1fymri9,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1fymri9/exchange_df54_or_upgrade_to_df64_400/,Exchange DF54 or upgrade to DF64 [$400],"I recently bought a DF54 grinder with an “open box” discount and thought I got a great deal. However, the grinder has been clogging up almost every time I use it to the point where it is almost unusable. I’ve taken apart the machine and completely cleaned it and vacuumed it out, and am still having the same issues. This isn’t just a grinder that needs the chute brushed out with the little pipe cleaner brush provided; the clogs are too dense for the brush and I have had to take the grinder apart and completely suck out all the coffee in order to get 30g of coffee, only to have it clog again. 

I am guessing the reason it was returned and resold as “open box” is because the first person who ordered it had the same issues. From what I’ve read here on Reddit, a few people have experienced similar issues, and the DF54 can be hit or miss in terms of whether it clogs to this degree or not.

I wrote to the people at MiiCoffee asking if I could exchange it and they told me that the DF54 is “prone to clogging” because it has a small chute, and exchanging it won’t fix the issue because all DF54s are the same. They suggested upgrading to the DF64 because it has a larger chute and is less likely to clog. The machine I bought doesn’t seem just “prone to clogging;“ it seems almost as though it might be missing a part or needs further troubleshooting (also the grinder is producing a crazy amount of static, which might be a separate issue).

I’ve also read accounts from people who’ve had clogging issues with the DF64 anyway- so will this really fix my issue? Or is it possible I just got a dud DF54 in the first place and a different one might work better?

I am looking for a grinder that works adequately for both pour over and espresso, and really don’t want to spend over $400 (please don’t tell me that I need to spend more- $400 should be good enough for a machine that grinds coffee even if it’s not the best espresso anyone has ever had).

- This is not my forever home so I’d really like to work with the bigger pieces I have if possible (blue couch, orange chair + ottoman, console table, lamp, desk, piano, and bar cart).
- Open to swapping out the rug and coffee table, and definitely would like to find a better substitute for the bookshelf next to the chair.

Is this a ‘normal’ amount of repairs for a machine of this age or is this a sign that it might be nearing the end of its life? 

Repairing is still currently cheaper than getting a new machine, but won’t be for much longer if something breaks again.

the worst part of any of this though has been how my body odour has changed. I used an AHA (mandelic acid) based deodorant beforehand, which creates an acidic environment that kills odour causing bacteria, which had always worked for me since my skin is sensitive to every single antiperspirant and deodorant I've ever tried, and I've tried most. this was never a problem until I developed parosmia.

now, I shower at least once a day but usually twice, I wash my armpits thoroughly, but even when I get out of the shower I still reek. I've asked my mom, my best friend, and my partner, all of whom confirm I don't smell, but to myself, I reek even after taking a shower and applying deodorant.

My opinion on the tariff debate has changed.,"Initially I was totally on Krystal's side. It seems crazy to apply tariffs on things like bananas and coffee which we can't even grow here (I guess? What about PR?). You notice she uses that pretty black and white  example a lot. Targeted tariffs make a lot of sense, but then again how are these criteria actually set? 

Things like semi conductors, steel, and medical supplies are obvious. But do we really trust our government to go through each industry with a fine tooth comb, decide if it's a good candidate for tariffs, and then monitor and actively update their status based on the outcome? I certainly do not.

I read American Flannel recently, and it slots in perfectly to this discussion.We used to have an incredibly strong textile industry here, we had quotas and tariffs that prevented offshoring, and over years that was all but eliminated to the point where the idea of making a flannel shirt from raw material to finished product all in America was considered impossible.  That's sad on so many levels. Would clothing and textiles get targetted tariffs? I think they should. 

I am now sympathetic to the blanket tarrif argument. I appreciate that Saagar is willing to acknowlage that there will be price increases in the short term. I understand that there are probably industries that are never going to blossom here. But I also think that there are industries that will flourish, that would overwise be overlooked by beaurocrats deciding who gets tariffs and who doesn't.

 it's kind of a similar idea behind UBI. Rather than means testing, which is an administrative/beaurocratic nightmare. Just doing it across the board.

All I received was approximately my original order (I think there was a very minor substitution of one item).

I’ve contacted chat support a few times, I was told at least once a refund was coming, I think twice I was told I would hear back from a compensation team. I haven’t heard back from anyone. I just called in to try and sort this issue out and was told that the refund was declined - am currently awaiting a manager call back, but not holding my breath to actually be contacted.

**Chapter One.**

Warlock set down his sniper rifle and tapped his communicator. He was a young man in his early twenties, with a slender yet muscular build. His dirty-blonde hair was cropped short, and he wore a tight-fitting black jumpsuit that accentuated his physique. He reached for his communicator and spoke into it, his voice calm and collected. Little was known about his past except that he once was part of Evantis, and that he hated that corp with a passion.

""Momma Bear, do you copy? I have a visual on the site. The good news, it looks surprisingly intact. It's some sort of underground facility. The bad news is that an Evantis detachment is already on site and clearing the rubble. I count two Hussar light mechs, two Mule haulers with light weapons, several rifle squads, and a Brawler heavy mech with what looks like a railgun."" 

He lifted his sniper rifle up again, peering through the scope. ""It seems like the corpo in charge is arguing with one of the officers. I could take one out, disrupt the situation.""

Several klicks away, Momma Bear's mech, a four-legged Atlas, lumbered to a halt. The pilot, a gruff woman in her thirties with a dishevelled blonde bob cut and a stern expression, peered through her binoculars at the scene unfolding before her. A veteran of the corporate wars, she was no stranger to violence.

""Copy that, Warlock,"" she replied, her voice crackling over the comms. ""Two Hussars, two Mules, and a Brawler with a railgun, huh? Pretty bad. But if your 'hunch' turns out to be right, this could be our jackpot. If we can get in there first.""

She tapped a few buttons on her control panel, bringing up a schematic of the facility on her HUD. ""I'm going to try and get into bombardment range. See if you can spot any weak points in their defences.""""

The Atlas shifted its stance, readying its massive missile racks for action. Momma Bear's eyes narrowed as she studied the scene, her mind already estimating the firing solutions. ""Keep an eye on those corpo bastards, Warlock. Once I give you the signal, I want you to take out that Brawler. Railguns are a pain in the ass.""

She took a deep breath, steeling herself for the task ahead. ""I'm moving in into range. Stay frosty.""

With that, the Atlas began to lumber forward, its massive legs carrying it closer to the site. Momma Bear's heart raced with anticipation, the thrill of the upcoming fight coursing through her

Gremlin sat inside her mech, Photon, gripping the control sticks tightly. Her short red hair was held back by the pair of goggles she wore on her forehead, and was in stark contrast to her green jumpsuit and her brown tool vest. Though still in her teens, she was considered a prodigy in the engineering field. She was also a tomboy at heart, more at ease in the repair bays than anywhere else. 

From within the relative safety of Photon, Gremlin watched as Momma Bear made her move. Her heart pounded in her chest, adrenaline coursing through her veins. This was it, the big one. The chance to prove herself, to show everyone that she was more than just the Princeps' coddled daughter. With a determined glint in her eye, Gremlin mentally prepared for whatever lay ahead.

She glanced over at Warlock, who was watching the scene unfold with a mix of excitement and concern. He gave her a small nod, a silent acknowledgement of the danger they were in.

She focused on the task at hand, her eyes scanning the area for any signs of movement. She could see the Hussars and Mules moving around the site, clearing rubble and searching for anything of value. The Brawler stood guard, its railgun trained on the entrance to the facility.

Gremlin's hands trembled slightly as she reached for her controls, ready to fire if necessary. She knew that one wrong move could mean the difference between life and death.

She took a deep breath, trying to calm her nerves. She had to stay focused, had to trust in her training and her abilities. She was a salvager, after all. She had been born for this.

She waited, tense and ready, as Momma Bear drew closer to the facility.

""Roger that, Momma Bear. I'm marking coordinates for a missile strike; you should be able to take out one of the Hussars along with the rifle squads that are running around. Well, and if the corpo eats shrapnel, too bad."" 
He transferred the targeting coordinates to Momma Bear. On your signal - I'll try to slag the railgun from here, then join you in the assault."" He peered at the Photon and his own Mech, a Drop Bear, sitting idly nearby. ""Okay, Gremlin, showtime. Stick close and try to stay behind me.""

""I'm in firing range. Start the show."" Momma Bear's voice came over the comms. 

The sniper rifle made an evil hiss as the barrel assembly split open, exposing crackling power coils and guidance rails. With calm hands, Warlock aimed at the railgun's power feed lines. A bright lance of energy erupted from the sniper rifle, piercing the Brawler's railgun and rendering it useless, along with most of the arm assembly it was attached to.

He could feel the heatwave coming from  the beam washing over his face, then got up and scrambled to get into the Drop Bear's cockpit. In the distance, he could hear the whistling of the approaching rocket barrage coming from the Atlas, followed by the rumble of explosions. As he closed the cockpit hatch and slammed the throttle forward, he could see the smoke rising already. ""Let's go, Gremlin. I've got your back.""

Gremlin's eyes widened as she watched the Brawler's arm explode in a shower of sparks and debris. She could see the heat of the blast even from this distance, the air around her shimmering with the force of it.

She nodded at Warlock, her heart racing with excitement and fear. ""Copy that, Warlock. I'm with you.""

She slammed the throttle forward, the Photon's legs propelling her forward with surprising speed. She could see Momma Bear's Atlas lumbering towards the site, its missile racks still open in preparation to fire again.

Gremlin kept her eyes on the Hussars and Mules, watching as they scrambled to take cover from the incoming missiles. She could see the confusion and panic on the soldiers' faces, the realisation that they were no longer in control of the situation.

Gripping the mech's controls tightly, her heart pounded in her chest. She was ready for anything, ready to fight for what she believed in. She was a salvager, after all. And she would not back down.

She followed close behind Warlock's mech, the Drop Bear, as they raced towards the site. 

The Drop Bear fired its vector thrusters, sailing through the air with all the grace a multi-ton war machine could muster. Zero.
It landed in the midst of the chaos, its eight spider legs absorbing most of the impact. 

One of the Hussars was limping away from him, clearly no longer in the condition to fight after the missile bombardment, while the other one was seemingly looking to avenge it. The 30mm cannon that made up most of its arm assembly started spitting fire, sending a volley of armour-piercing slugs towards the Drop Bear.

Gremlin watched in awe as Warlock's mech landed in the midst of the chaos, its spider legs absorbing the impact with ease. She was rather proud of its performance; after all, she had designed the Drop Bear's leg assembly herself.
She saw the Hussar firing its cannon at the Drop Bear, the slugs tearing through its armour.

She once again gripped the controls tightly, her heart racing as she watched the battle unfold. She knew that Warlock was skilled, but she couldn't help but worry about his safety.

She knew that she had to do something, had to help him in any way she could. She reached for her controls, her hands trembling slightly as she prepared to fire.

A brilliant green beam erupted from the laser cannon mounted in the Photon's chest, searing a deep gash into the Hussar's chest armour.

""Ha!"" she exclaimed triumphantly, then watched with horror as the Hussar opened fire on her. She almost panicked, then recalled the defense protocol that Sidewinder, the crawler's resident Ace, had drilled into her. Her hand flicked the switch for the electro-magnetic shield projector. A slight smell of ozone filled the cockpit air as the 30mm shells bounced off harmlessly, detonating as they hit the ground. 

Warlock noticed the Hussar firing at the youngest squad member, and he was having none of it. The Drop Bear swivelled towards the damaged Hussar, spinning up its rotary minigun and unleashing a barrage of explosive death upon it. A steady stream of bullets tore away the Hussar's armour, then pierced its torso. Hydraulic fluid and coolant gushed from it's cratered chest as it crumpled to the ground, no longer able to move or fight.  

Momma Bear turned to face the Brawler, whose railgun was a shredded mess. With its primary armament out of commission, she didn't expect much resistance. Still, they couldn't risk any nasty surprises. Her targeting reticule aligned over the massive machine, and with the pull of her trigger, she launched yet another missile barrage from the Atlas' racks, the impacts ripping and tearing at the enemy machine.

Warlock, in the meantime, turned towards the Mules, firing yet another barrage of shells at the bulky cargo haulers. One of the four-legged machines was immobilised, hydraulic fluid jetting in dark streams from its legs. The other one returned fire with a machine gun, barely denting the Drop Bear's armour.

Between the Drop Bear's minigun and the Photon's laser cannon, its fate was sealed; it blew its escape hatch, and the pilot crawled out, hands raised as he limped towards cover.

A crackling voice came over the comms. ""My escape hatch is stuck. I surrender. I don't want to die."" The panic-stricken voice of a teenager came over the comms. Momma Bear's Atlas veered towards the heavily damaged, but still moving second Hussar, its own 30mm cannon trained on the failing machine.

Using the distraction, the damaged Brawler attempted to leave the scene. It managed to reach the installation's perimeter, breaching one of the crumbling walls as a brilliant green beam seared through it's hip assembly, severing one of the legs.
A small mech, a Mantis, rushed towards the installation, its spindly legs carrying it as fast as they could. As it approached, it struck the immobilised Brawler two more times, forcing it out of commission. By the time the Brawler's pilot had managed to climb out of the wreck, the Mantis had reached it as well. 

""Going somewhere, big guy?"" The pilot's voice came mockingly over the comms. The cockpit hatch opened, revealing a small woman with black hair and a wicked grin. The Mantis's long-barrelled laser swivelled towards the flabbergasted pilot. ""Hands over your head, and back into the compound you go. And no wrong moves, for you are soft, flammable, and within firing range."" She giggled, then paraded her prisoner towards the other salvagers.

""Sorry, folks, I got delayed. Traffic and all,""  she greeted the other salvagers via the comms. Taking in the extent of the destruction around her, she pouted melodramatically. ""Aww, this isn't fair! You totally wrecked the place without me!"" 

""Yeah, Jester, we're also happy to see you."" Warlocks dry reply came over the comms. 


**Chapter Two**

""Onyx, give me a tactical analysis.""

The small black holographic cat appeared shimmering in the above Jester's wristcomp. His tail flicked as he scanned the environment. 

""Long version or short version?""

""Short version.""

""Terrible mess. Lots of valuable salvage. Two potential prisoners. Time to loot.""

Jester sighed. ""Okay, lazy-ass. The long version, but make it snappy.

""Make up your mind, will you? Very well then. Enemy mechs have been thoroughly disabled. One of the Mule's looks repairable. Infantry forces were neutralised by the Atlas' earlier missile bombardment. I calculate a less than 10% chance of any survivors, but if you feel humanitarian, you can check how correct my calculations are."" The cat hologram started licking its paws. ""The main compound is still sealed, I'm not detecting any active power sources, and radome readings indicate no imminent reinforcements. It's just you and these two potential prisoners."" 

Jester shot the cat a disapproving look. ""Potential?""

""Well, according to my calculations, we're short on rations for the return trip, and they are probably uncooperative. It is therefore advisable to execute them.""

""Your suggestions have been noted, Onyx. Also, fuck you."" Momma Bear growled. ""The Union Charter explicitly forbids the execution of surrendered enemy forces. It sets a bad example and invites unnecessary retaliation.""

""Well, I'll have a look around and see if anyone survived the bombardment."" Gremlin grabbed a first aid kit and went off, pale and visibly shocked at the AI's assessment.

Jester, seeing the young girl slink away, grinned and followed her. ""I'll go with her. I bet she'll puke."" 

That left Momma Bear and Warlock, who took a look at their prisoners, both still in their pilot suits, visors down. According to the callsigns stencilled on their helmets, the smaller one was called Banshee, and the larger one was Wedge.

""Okay, let's keep this somewhat civil. You're already disarmed and pose no immediate threat. What were you doing out here?""

The larger pilot opened his visor. ""Sergeant David Matos. Call sign Wedge. UID Number 62345-3455. That's all you'll get from me.""

Warlock raised an eyebrow. ""A hardass, I see. Look, technically, you're prisoners of war as the Union Charta is concerned. Since you're already disarmed, you're free to fuck off if you want.""

""Wait, what?"" the smaller once exclaimed. ""You're letting us go?"" She sounded rather young. 
The larger one replied in a gruff voice. ""Yeah, why get your hands dirty when the wastes can kill us instead? Are you short on ammunition, union man?""

""Oh, I figure Momma Bear here could slit your throat on the cheap, but really - that's not how this works. That's not how any of this works. Do you have any idea what this facility even is?""

The shorter pilot, Banshee, blurted out. ""Well, according to the briefing, it's some sort of medical facility - so why did you attack us?""

""Medical...yeah. You could call it that if you squint really hard."" He sighed. ""I insist you take a look at what's inside. After that, you're free to go, if you want. We'll even fix up the disabled mule, but we're somewhat low on rations, as you probably already heard."" 

""Do YOU know what's inside?"" Momma Bear tilted her head and shot the scout a quizzical look. 
""Yeah, I have a hunch. And trust me, I hope I'm dead wrong.""


**Chapter 3** 


""I totally told you not to look."" Jester said, grinning.

""How can you be so hardened? What the fuck is wrong with you?"" Gremlin replied, leaning against a wall and staring in bewilderment at her puked-up breakfast. 

""Eh, comes with the occupation. Welcome to the wasteland, where life is cheap and death is seldom quick.""

""That dying kid was barely older than me.""

""I guess he appreciated your presence. I'm pretty sure he mistook you for his mom before the blood loss did him in."" 

Gremlin looked at the young woman, looking like she was about to dry-heave.

""Look, you wanted to come along; prove that you're more than just the mousy kid from the mech pit. Warlock warned you that you're not cut out for this, but no, you had to try and impress him.""

Gremlin clenched her fists. “I'm not a mousy kid!”

""That's the spirit, young Gremlin. Let the anger flow through you! No, seriously, that kind of shit happens around here. And for the books, better they than you."" She handed the young engineer her canteen. ""Here, rinse. I see Momma Bear and the rest coming, and they don't need to smell that you kind of wussed out. Snap out of it; you're needed, and you couldn't have saved him anyway."" 

Gremlin grabbed the canteen, took a swig, and rinsed. As she returned it, she straightened herself. ""Okay. I'll do my best. I'm not sure if I should thank you for the pep talk or simply hate your guts.""

""Whatever keeps you awake at night, dear."" Jester grinned, then sauntered off to meet the others.

""Everything okay here?"" Momma Bear asked.

""Well, mostly. We found a few gently pre-owned rifles, never fired, and just dropped once."" Jester replied. 

""Any survivors?"" 

""Zero at present,""  Jester replied truthfully. 

""Warlock, you take point. Go handle the door. I'll fire up the Atlas' Prawn Sifter and clean up the mess outside."" Momma Bear took a glance at the two prisoners, then headed towards her massive four-legged machine. 

""Of course. Hey, Jester, where's Gremlin? I'll need her technical expertise."" 

""Freshening up a bit, I guess?"" 

""I'm here. Let's check that door."" The young engineer looked still a little pale, but her usual lively demeanour had seemed to return. 

""Okay, Gremlin. Your analysis?"" 

""Well, it looks like it won't budge. Power seems down, and the door to the underground entrance is pretty solid. Air vents are too small to enter, and it looks like they installed cutting wire against the vermin."" 

""Oh, it looks like the union slaughtered us only to be defeated by a common door."" Wedge mocked. 

""Well, before you guys blew everything up, the captain was discussing the same issue with the executive,"" Banshee mentioned.

Jester returned, carrying a small suitcase with warning labels.

""Warlock, my man, I got that door thing. Let me ask you one question, and one question only.""

The blonde-haired scout tilted his head, looking at the smiling hacker girl. ""And that would be?""

""Explosions?"" She happily exclaimed, pointing at the breaching charge in her hands.


**Chapter 4**


""Well, it did manage to breach the door, kinda."" Gremlin inspected the hole that the charge had torn into the massive steel door. 

""Well, the hole is too small for me."" Warlock stated the obvious.

""Yeah, looks like my butt's too big for it, too,"" Gremlin added, happy for once to be short and stout.

""Why are you looking at me like that?"" Jester grumbled. ""Can't we use one of the prisoners?""

""No."" Warlock stated dryly. ""First of all, it's against the charter, and then I need someone I can trust inside.""

""Wait, you trust her? She's unhinged at best!"" Gremlin protested.
""You know I can hear you, right?"" Jester grumbled, eying the narrow hole in the door.
""With my life. Now listen, there should be a control panel inside; with some luck, there's a manual hydraulic release for the door."" Warlock added.

The young engineer pondered. ""Wait, if there's a control panel, then there's wiring. I might be able to rig up a power supply using the Photon's main reactor. Jester only needs to open the panel and hook up the cables.""

""So. You want me to dive head first into a pitch-black underground corporate facility, unscrew a wall panel, and hook up a jury-rigged power supply to a wiring loom that has been powered down since the last corporate war?"" Jester's face made it clear that she didn't like that plan one bit.

""Yes."" Gremlin smiled and handed her an electric torch. ""You go unscrew the panel; I'll get the power."" She ran off to her mech, her mind already formulating a plan on how to jury-rig a power line. 

Warlock helped the petite hacker to wriggle through the small breach. ""Eeeesh. It smells like dead stuff in here."" 

""Can you manage?""
""Do the lizards here shit in the sand? Of course I can.""

As he was left alone with the scout, Wedge pondered if he could overwhelm and disarm him. Then he remembered the Atlas that was clearing up the battlefield.

""So, what will happen to us?"" Banshee asked, removing her helmet. 

The blonde union scout sat down on a piece of rubble and looked at the smaller pilot. A scrawny kid, tan, with a black buzzcut, barely sixteen at best. If this was the best Evantis had to offer here, then they were scraping the bottom of the barrel already. 

""Well. As far as we're concerned, you're free to go. I still think you should have a look inside the installation and then decide if you really want to go back,"" he said enigmatically.

""And if we don't decide to go back?"" she asked.

""Soldier, are you attempting to fraternise with the enemy?"" Wedge snapped, raising his hand. The sound of a safety clicking off made him reconsider his next steps.

""Let me guess, the chain of command between the two of you is the chain you beat her with if she doesn't follow?""

""I'm the one in charge between us!"" barked Wedge, lowering his hand.

""...yes."" Banshee said quietly.

Warlock sighed. ""As I said, you're free to go. We can either take you aboard the crawler, fix you up, and drop you off at the nearest local settlement. Or you can join us if you think you're cut out for the Union.""

""Wait...you'd simply take me in?"" Banshee stared incredulously at the young man. 

""See, the main difference between the corporations and the unions is this: The unions stop hating you the moment you cease to be corpos. The corporations start hating you once you step out of line.""  

""I don't believe a single word of this bullshit!"" Wedge removed his helmet, revealing a beardless man in his early thirties, sporting a similar black military buzzcut. A tribal tattoo covered a good part of his cheek and neck. ""You're lucky you're holding a gun right now, or I'd tear your lying jaw out.  

Warlock gave him a wry grin. 

""I'm not lying. I was on Evantis payroll long enough."" he said calmly.

""So you're a merc then? A dirty sell-sword going for the highest bidder?""

""No. Quite frankly, I used to be an officer.""

""And you traded that for...this?"" Wedge gesticulated wildly, pointing at the crumbling installation. ""A bunk in a rusty hulk populated by a bunch of scripless communists?""

Gremlin, trailing a heavy cable behind her, had overheard the last bit. ""I'll have you know that the Phobos isn't rusty in the least bit. And his cabin is pretty roomy.""

""Also, we're anarcho-syndicalists. Though explaining the exact differences might be lost on you. But yes, it's a moneyless society. You know, 'From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs.' I was sceptical at first, too. But we make it work.""

""Also, we have food, at least back on the crawler."" Gremlin remarked snidely upon seeing the scrawny young girl."" She trailed the cable through the breach. ""Hey Jester, I got the power. Go hook it up.""

""Thank goodness. I was just about to witness Warlock teaching another mental deep-sea roundworm the basics of anarchism.""

Warlock flicked the safety of his machine pistol back on and nursed his hurt pride, while Jester and Gremling managed to restore power to the facility.

The massive door slid into the ground, making a screeching noise as the breached parts scraped metal against metal. 
Jester pulled out her hand console and plugged it into a socket on the exposed panel's interior. 

""Well, now we got power; it's time to make this facility's network my personal bitch.""

""Jester, please be careful. Power is limited, so maybe stick with lights and air exchangers. This whole place smells awful...""

""Fine, okay, I'll try not to drain your precious overengineered piece of shit's batteries too hard.""

""Hey! I like my Photon!"" Gremlin protested.

""You got to separate the engineering work from the asshat that thought it was a great idea."" Warlock interjected. ""It works surprisingly well for what we use it for. Not that Sküm was a visionary; the original idea was crap. It's just that 2 corporate wars later the solar reactors on those things come in damn handy.""

""And Jester said, 'Let there be light!' and lo! there was light."" The young hacker grinned. ""Atmosphere exchangers are running as well. Internal defences powered down. Come on, someone praise me!""

Warlock sighed. ""You did a good job, Jester. We appreciate it.""

""Awwww, that's sweet, but you totally didn't need to thank me..."" she replied with the most shit-eating grin imaginable.


**Chapter 5**

Jester whistled appreciatively. ""Well, look at this."" 

A large mech loomed in one of the docking bays, the paint still factory fresh. 

""That mech is still intact, it seems...what a find!"" Gremlin exclaimed. ""Never seen that pattern, but I recognise some of the parts...the big thing here is an Evantis Hellbore Plasma Cannon! I always wanted to get my hands on one of those!""

Momma Bear and Warlock said nothing, but stared quietly at the silent machine.

""Fuck, Warlock. You were right."" 
""I hoped I wouldn't be...""

Banshee tilted her head and looked at the two union pilots. ""What's with you guys? You look like you've seen a ghost?""

""In a way, I have."" The scout stated. Ever since they had entered the compound, his mood seemed to become gloomier by the minute. 

""Let's see if I can power this up and walk it outside. It's in pristine condition, after all, the fuel rods should still be okay."" Gremlin exclaimed, then paused. ""Where's the cockpit hatch on this thing?""

""There isn't one."" Momma Bear's reply came.

""What do you mean? 'There isn't one'?"" Banshee looked at the older woman.

""This is a Neurophage unit. The pilot is hooked up to a life support capsule, and their nervous system gets hardwired into the mech's control mainframe."" Warlock stated, anger in his voice rising.

""What do you mean, 'hardwired'?"" Jester asked, then it dawned on her. ""Wait...I heard about those. They didn't exactly use volunteers for those back in the war. So...this is basically an armoured, walking coffin with guns?""

""More or less."" Momma Bear replied, her voice drained of all emotion. ""Warbird worked on a few of those back in the war. The pilot is considered an expendable organic component, to be removed once deemed defective. She said quite a few of those pilots have gone insane. The corpos preferably hooked up people that had no other choice."" She sighed. ""It's a vile piece of junk, but leaving it here would be stupid. You check the rest of the facility, I'll see if Atlas and me can drag the thing out and get it stashed somehow.""

Wedge had grown quiet. ""So, this facility..."" 
""It was listed as a 'processing facility'. I assume your board members considered reopening it.""
""So, why are you here? You might be a bleeding-heart communist, but I'm sure you're not doing this for the good of the people."" 
""That is correct."" Warlock replied curtly. ""We are depriving you of this facility, and we intend to salvage the medical equipment. While we're not keen on hardwiring anyone into a walking coffin, there's quite some useful stuff here. Emergency life support capsules, neural interfaces, nerve splicers...""
""Which you intend to sell?""
""Which we intend to use. For the good of our people.""

They moved deeper into the facility, the stench of decay lessening as the air exchangers worked hard to replenish the stale air inside the underground facility. 

""Here's some operating theatres, according to the map."" Jester said. ""I guess we ought to take a look inside, see what's easy to remove and transport."" She pushed a door open. The sweet stench of decay was strong. A very decomposed skeleton was sitting on a gurney. ""I guess that's what's left of the pilot for the mech outside?""

Warlock glanced at the corpse. ""Yeah, looks like it."" 
""Where are the legs???"" Gremlin looked at him, abject terror in her face.
He examined the corpse closer. ""Clean cut at both thighbones, probably amputated. Whoever this was, they didn't have them when they were brought here. Might have been a landmine, or maybe a botched ejection. Whatever, they were left behind, then the facility was evacuated."" 

""Well, they're dead now, and as such, exempt from the dreary task of cleaning out this place."" Jester grumbled. ""The way I see it, we'll be hauling machinery out of this place for hours. Let's move; we got more ground to cover.""

They progressed further into the facility, noticing the stench of decay getting stronger.

""You said the facility was evacuated, and we've seen only one dead body so far...so why does it stink to the high heavens in here?"" Banshee complained.

""Maybe some large vermin colony?"" Jester suggested.

""Can't be."" Gremlin replied. ""There's cutting wire stretched across the air ducts. Anything crawling into there only arrives pre-sliced. What does your map say?""

""Mh. Medical storage. Pretty large one, too."" Jester replied, overriding another door lock.

That's when the stench became overwhelming.  

In the storage hall, rows of large glass cylinders lined the walls, filled with a sickly-looking brown liquid. A few had cracked and spilt their contents onto the grated floor, where the stinking fluid pooled below.

Banshee instantly started to dry-heave as the stench hit her nostrils. Gremlin and Jester turned a whiter shade of pale; the first had already gotten rid of her breakfast, while the second seemed more puzzled than anything. ""Yo, Warlock, my man - what am I looking at here?""

""Looks like life support coffins. I assume this is where they stored the pilots before 'processing' them."" He scrunched his face, the smell clearly overwhelming him. ""Judging from the smell, the life support had failed at some point. I hope they weren't conscious when that happened.""

""So. This is a dead pilot slushy?"" 

""More like expired pilot soup.""

""Do you think these are still operational?"" Gremlin whispered. ""I mean, after they've been...cleaned out.""

""Probably. We won't need all of them. A dozen or so should suffice. I think Momma Bear has a hazard protection suit somewhere.""

Wedge stared at the rows of glass cylinders. ""So...they just left them here to die?"" 

""More or less. The facility was abandoned and sealed. They probably intended to return at some point, but well, war happened. And it's not like they didn't consider them expendable.""

""We need to talk, you and I. But preferably somewhere with cleaner air.""

""I concur. Jester, are we clear here for the moment?""

""Well, there's a server room deeper inside, but you meatheads would only get in my way. I'll grab the isolinear memory chips from there and join you outside. Don't worry - I can handle the smell."" She grinned, making Banshee wonder if she had any sense of smell at all.

**Chapter 6**

""I'm not sure if I should thank you or curse you."" Wedge stated surly.

""Because I showed you that you're not working for the good guys?"" Warlock replied.

""Well, there's that. But of course this shit is above my pay grade and security clearance. If we return to the arcology, we'll probably get fast-tracked to get stuffed into one of those things. Maybe they'll throw in some behavioural modification surgery, too, to make sure we keep silent.""

""Some...what?"" Banshee asked, staring in disbelief.

""Don't worry about that. You're not going back with me. As far as I'm concerned, you died in the assault. Go with the union people. Whatever they'll do with you is preferable to what awaits you back there. And I'm sorry. For how we treated you."" Wedge sat down on a pile of rubble. ""I won't ask for forgiveness. I know what we did.""

""You look like you're about to swallow a gun."" Warlock stated. ""Don't.""

""You don't understand. I've pretty much nowhere left to go. And I don't want to end up like that.""

""Well, you could always try the union life. Or, barring that, there's a few mercenary outfits that won't ask their new recruits too many questions. Of course, I admit your old lives are pretty much gone now.""

""Was that your plan? All along?"" Banshee asked, resentment lingering in her voice. ""We could have returned without knowing...all this.""

""You were already included in the plans. You wouldn't be here otherwise. Evantis revives the assembly line, and tests the canning process on a few expendable soldiers. If it works, it works, and if not... too bad. Nothing of value lost.""

""You're lying!"" She hissed. 

""Maybe. Maybe not. You can, of course, return to the arcology and find out.""

""You will NOT do that. That's an order."" He sighs. ""A strongly worded suggestion, okay?"" He turns back to the scout. ""Okay, we'll come along. I'm not afraid of a quick, clean death. But this..."" he gesticulates in the direction of the facility entrance. ""This is wrong. Simple as that."" 

""I'll look for Gremlin and ask her to fix the Mule up, then. If you really want to chip in, you can help move some of the medical equipment."" He looks at them for a moment. ""Have you eaten lately?""

""Well, one of the Mules you blew up earlier carried supplies and ammo, but we were on emergency rations already.""

""We're short, but you can have one of mine. I'll ask around if one of the others is willing to skip dinner.""


**Epilogue**

""This is pretty good. What is this?"" Banshee asked. She had tried to eat slowly, but her last proper meal felt like ages ago, and the savoury aroma was irresistible.

""Bubble's famous canned chilli, judging from the smell."" Momma Bear replied stoically, looking at the scrawny kid that devoured her last ration. They'd reach the Phobos by nightfall tomorrow. A little hunger wouldn't kill her, but the kid was in awful shape. ""You're lucky. Our chef is pretty proud of that stuff. That means the rest is foil-packed cornbread, and the small tin probably tinned fruit. Oh, and take this."" She pulled out a small foil-packed bar and handed it to her.

""What's that?""

""It's hard to explain. It's sort of an emergency bar.""

Jester took a look at the bar. ""It tastes somewhat like a chocolate bar, with a heavy coffee note and a spicy aftertaste. Bubbles did some sort of kitchen magic with an indigenous plant. They're pretty good, but pack an absolutely nasty caffeine kick. One bar keeps you pretty much awake all night. Two of them will give you heart palpitations."" 

""Oh, that reminds me..."" Warlock said dryly as he passed a tea kettle around. ""What happened that one time you ate four?""

""Don't remind me..."" The hacker said, her eyes going wide. ""My teeth vibrated, and I could smell tomorrow.""


They laughed. 

Wedge spoke up. ""Thanks for the meal. I have to admit your stuff is tastier than the last rations I had.""

""I could wax poetic about the secret ingredient being love, and our chef wants us to be happy when we eat, while whoever manufactures those awful MREs just wants to make sure you're fed. But I'll keep it at 'You're welcome; I'll pass your compliments along to the chef.' Or better yet, you could tell her yourself. We'll reach the crawler by tomorrow's nightfall."" Momma Bear replied. 

""That reminds me of that one time we had to eat these salvaged MREs."" Gremlin recalled with disgust. ""Those rations were older than me!""

""Oh, come on. They were an excellent vintage, carefully matured in an abandoned storage bunker. A feast for the discerning connoisseur."" Jester snickered. 

""So, we shared food. Does that make us something?"" Wedge addressed Warlock, who had gone hungry to feed him.
""It makes me the one who gives according to his ability, and you the one who receives according to his needs. I can go for a day on an empty stomach. Thanks for helping us haul the medical equipment, by the way.""

""You're welcome. So, you're taking us right into the heart of evil, as the corporation describes it?""
""Mh, it's rather cosy, given its nature. There's a few things you should follow, though.""

""I was expecting there was a catch. What are the rules?""

""It's not really rules. We're all equals. Regardless, you'll be asked to stay out of certain areas unless accompanied. You'll find the doors closed otherwise.""

""Like?""

""Mostly critical infrastructure. The mech bays, the armoury, the fire control systems, hydroponic bays, fusion reactors. You get the idea.""

""Fusion reactors? As in multiple? Just how big is this crawler of yours?""

""As of the last census, we're fifteen thousand strong. And it's rather roomy, if a bit spartan.""

Wedge and Banshee looked incredulously at Warlock. ""You're pulling our legs, aren't you?""

""He's right."" Jester threw in from the sides. ""The thing is a bloody moving city. I was surprised myself when I first got there.""

""That 'thing' has a name, you know."" Momma Bear grumbled. 

""Yeah, it's Union Crawler #137, the Phobos."" Gremlin added with pride. ""Home.""

**To Fall in Love with Me**

My favourite part of falling in love, is how you get to immerse yourself in the world of another. Every human being is a universe of values, an inner realm of experience containing so much meaning and light. And when you fall for someone, you get to lose yourself in the gaze of the other --- seeing the world through their perspective, taking upon the values and meanings of your partner as your own. In that way, my relationships change the way I perceive the world, and my experience of reality becomes all the more vivid through you.

This is my conception of love. And I've realized at a young age that such love does not easily fit within the confines of a single person. That's why I'm looking for two (or perhaps three!) partners to have a polyamorous relationship together. I want us to be a dream-team power-couple (triple?) that'll fall in love together. I want to get to know the world through your perspectives, and feel my heart go a-flutter, at beauty that you can perceive.

**Who am I?**

I'm a 24-year-old research scientist working in the experimental sciences. By day, I delight in sparkling conversations and insightful chats, the subtle dignity of the lab along with the glamour of the conference. But above all, I cherish the world and all the experiences that it has to offer --- whether it be through art, literature, or the humanities.

I am fit, 5'10"" tall, with black hair and brown eyes. I enjoy a good blazer and a collared shirt just as much as hiking boots and a sailing jacket. I suppose my overall aesthetic can be described as comfortably stylish :)

I speak four languages. Three with some fluency, but the rest with just enough skill to get into trouble! Originally from Europe, I grew up in Asia --- and spent a great deal of my youth travelling, until I landed in the U.S. for my job.

In terms of relationships, I've had a poly-relationship before, which I enjoyed immensely. We parted ways as I left the country, but it was an experience that made me realise that being poly was the way for me!

Outside of my work and my studies, I am an avid outdoorsperson. I've hiked and summited some of the highest mountains in my native country, and I hope to go on many more hikes and adventures in the U.S.! One of my dreams is to build out a van, and travel the country with the both of you, visiting trails and parklands, in a tour of the great outdoors.

**Who are you?**

You can be anyone. I'm not looking for someone who is similar to me, but different in ways that are uniquely yours. In particular, I fall for people who are passionate about something --- whether in the arts or the sciences. Whether you're an artist who takes pride in his portraits, or a concert musician who loves the interplay of harmony and sound, I want to hear you speak about your passion, and fall for you. In particular, I'm hoping to meet someone who is talented and skilled in an aspect of the world that is completely novel to me. After all, I want to get to know what's beautiful about our existence through your own, resplendent gaze.

And I want to be clear, I am very much imagining this as a relationship that we are all building together. So if you reach out to me, you should be open to dating and getting to know not just me, but another interesting stranger from Reddit! I believe that since we'll all be getting to know each other at the same time, the relationship can start with a sense of equality.

**What do I want from our relationship?**

I want us to travel together. I want our relationship to grow through coffee-dates and picnics, until our time together feels as effortless and natural as a warm embrace. I don't imagine (nor expect) for each of us to love the other in the *same* way. But rather, I hope the three of us will grow to cherish the unique strengths and natures of the other, until we create something that is uniquely ourselves.

And I very much intend the three of us to be a team, together. Although we might have different skills or careers, I hope that we'll be able to compliment and support each other, in our own unique ways!

Also sorry if I make grammatical mistakes, I am not native.


        I guess I will start from the beginning - my mother went to a different country when I was about 3 years old so she can end the relationship with my biological father face to face (he was working in that country back then; they were not married - I was unplanned), leaving me with my grandma (her mother) who is a super toxic person (more on that later). After all she stayed in that country to work so she can help my grandma pay back a dept. She trusted my grandma with taking care of me. Well she shouldn’t have. My grandma being a musician was always away and payed our neighbours (an old couple) to take care of me. When she wasn’t away my grandma used scream at me and beat me for no good reason. She also spent most of the money my mother sent her to buy me clothes and toys, on herself. Some years later my mom told me that while she was away, she planned on leaving me behind and starting a new life, forgetting everything from the past, but obviously since I was still young and naive I told her that I completely understand and forgive her, because I knew what she needed to go through cuz of my grandma.

       One day me and my grandma went to visit my mother, and I was introduced to my now stepdad. She told me that they are friends but were in fact already married (around a year passed between her going away and us visiting her). He was a nice guy, really caring (made a driving license and got a car when he found out I like cars and that I will be visiting in the future), and we became very good friends. 

      Some time passed and my mom finally came home together with my stepdad. I was so unused of her that once she came home I was sitting on the stairs at the entrance door and asked permission to go close to her and hug her. Well things didn’t get better - few years of falling asleep to fights between my mother and grandma, sometimes getting physical too. I many times fell asleep crying out of fear. When I was 8 my first (half)sister was born. Obviously this brought even more fights. One night, after my mom showered my sister, she asked my grandma to dress her up, until she runs to the city cuz of an emergency. Well my grandma decided to go and take food to a middle aged guy next-door who she liked (he was the son of the old couple who took care of me), and left my sister on the bed, naked in december with the window open at around 9pm (she was 6 months old, my stepdad was working). Obviously she got a fever the next day, and it got so bad that she was very close to dying. We took her to the hospital and everything ended up fine. Off course more fights came out of this, and for some reason my grandma was offended for this situation like she was the victim, and she said we have 3 months to move out. 


    Well we moved out and things became even worse. We moved to the other end of the city, problem is that the train station was very close and on the way to my school. My grandma back then was going to a different city every monday to teach some kids music. She used every monday morning to meet me on the way (going out hours earlier than she needed to), so she could start manipulating me against my parents. She started by telling me about my biological father who I didn’t have any memories with, and I also wasn’t in contact with him because my mother made him give up completely on me in court. I told these things to my mother cuz I knew my grandma isn’t the best person ever. Well she instantly forbid me to meet or talk to my grandma. Which made me confused as a child. I didn’t completely understand everything going on in the family, and I still loved my grandma. I had a connection with her for another reason too - I fell in love with the instrument she played, and chose it as my career at a very young age.

      Anyway around the age of 11 we moved back to the same street as my grandma lived on because of it being in the center of the city and right next to the central park. Bad stuff really started here. I started secretly going to my grandma since I missed her. Which became a problem later on when my mom found out but in time she understood my point to and said that I have a right to meet her. Problems started with my stepdad tho. He is from an islamic country, and decided to be more harsh with me becoming a muslim too. After a while this became him very badly beating me almost on the daily if I didn’t keep the smallest rule of the religion. There was another problem too. We live in europe and there was no other muslim kid in my school, so I got bullied a lot for my religion. Another issue was that as time passed people around me got to know more and more that I am really talented at my instrument. Obviously my parents started forcing me to practice a lot and beating me if I didn’t. I also lost most of my childhood because of constant competitions and music events. Because of all the things going on in my life I started stress eating and gained weight - another reason for me to get bullied at school. 
I also didn’t have friends as I child. I found my first friend when I was 15 so I was alone against my whole family. 

    Jumping to when I was 16 I decided to switch schools, after I got an invitation to a high school in a different country. I only resisted half a year their but it was a life changing period of time. Everything there started with a fight with my stepdad for no good reason again, before saying goodbye - I was blue and green all over my body for about 2 weeks. After they left I was shocked by freedom. School started, I made a lot of friends and had a lot of fun. One day I went to a friend to sleepover and play some video games. I was very deeply shocked after seeing how a normal, healthy family looks like. Once I got back to my dorm and I realized how many things were wrong in my life, I fell asleep crying for weeks. I had huge fights with my mom in text. Meanwhile I met my now girlfriend who showed me what it mean to really live life and how open minded people are. After about 5 months I decided to come home. I was really home sick and sth felt wrong inside of me. I just wanted to run away from there because I thought the feelings I felt were because of the place. After a lot of crying and screaming at my mom she finally agreed to me coming home. My girlfriend is a ukranien refugee, living in that country alone, working at 17,she wanted to leave that country, so I told her that my grandma has an extra room and she could live there (we weren’t dating back then but were super close friends and we both knew we like each other). Since she loves adventure she said yes. 

   Eventually we started dating before us coming here, and we moved to my grandma together. My grandma always tried to give me everything she could, since I was her “little musician” so she easily agreed to us living there until my girlfriend can find a job and move out. Meanwhile my relationship with my mom got worse and worse, she started caring less and less about me. My stepdad started working in another city since he helped a friend open a business, and started working for him. So I didn’t talk to him, and even when he came to visit I never went over to their place, if it wasn’t necessary. After a while my grandma started becoming very toxic. We had our own room but she constantly told us what and how to arrange, and such small stuff. After 3 months of coming back I decided to quit music. I hated it with my all of my heart, because I felt like most people, including my family don’t see me for more than my talent. This made my grandma hate me, and she said that my girlfriend is at fault (she didn’t know about my decision or thoughts ab it for about a week after me quitting). She started slowly ruining my mental health, and constantly fighting with me over nothing, also not giving us food at all.

     After 5 more months of this and almost no support from my mom, my girlfriend found a stable job, and we agreed to move out together because it was an extremely toxic environment. I sold my phone and pc, bought the cheapest smartphone I found and we moved out with that money. We could only find an apartment in the outskirts of the city so getting to places was difficult, since we both don’t have driving licenses. I begged my mom to give me some money every month so I can also help with some products, and eventually she agreed to ab 100$ a month. We lived there together for around a year….it was definitely difficult. She was 18 and I was 17, and such responsibilities were a lot for the both of us, but I also had a huge bag of traumas with me, which I couldn’t heal while heaving constant financial stress. (meanwhile, thanks to one of my great also musician friend and an amazing teacher I got over my hater towards my instrument and found to passion again). 

     While we were living I tried to rebuild my relationship with my mom, who, even after all that happened, I love a lot. Her marriage also started declining because of my stepdad being constantly away, becoming toxic, very close minded towards her about culture and religion, and lack of communication which is very necessary in such a big cultural difference. 
I am a very loving person so I frequently went for a coffee with my mom to listen to her problems, and tried to help her, and like this I became her emotional trash bag. After a while our financials got worse. Since we are both smokers a lot of money of course went there too. I tried to quit a lot of times to help with financial but I am just too emotionally dependent on them at the moment. I spend all my money on groceries and tried to not eat at home so my girlfriend has more food. I was living off of my friends basically. They bought me food constantly, and my also smoker friend always shared his cigarettes with me. This also effected me a lot, because I felt awful for the fact that they spend that much on me, but I didn’t have any other choice, and just hoped that my friendships won’t be ruined cuz of this. 

    During talks with my mom I started questioning her about the past, about why she doesn’t help me more financially, even tho she could if she stopped spending on nonsense (one day I asked her to send me like 3$ so I can  by myself sth to eat because I didn’t the whole day, it’s already evening and I won’t be home for a while. she said she doesn’t have money, and then a couple of days later she proudly sent me a picture of her new car that she just bought). Well my answer was mostly silence, until I got the answer of my life - “I think that u don’t have any traumas or problems, u just make them up to manipulate people around u”…well even after this I forgave her and continued helping, loving her. 

    I slowly started to get worse mentally, and started to give up. So this past summer, I broke up with my girlfriend. I didn’t think it was right for me to maybe also ruin her with my mental health, and she deserved better than me. I didn’t have the mental energy anymore to give her the attention I wanted to, I couldn’t have as many activities with her as before because of my condition. Living with her was also more stress then I could handle, because she made the money and I felt awful living off of her money, and not being able to add a lot. So we broke up and the next day I moved back to my moms place. Well the greatest surprise was that my stepdad was home that day….and my room wasn’t like before (we have 2 rooms - 1 for parents, 1 for kids). The kids room was transformed into my moms bedroom that she doesn’t use at all because of some bad fight with my stepdad, and the other room is where she sleeps with my sisters (I got another even younger (half)sister too but forgot to say earlier). So I basically have nowhere to be. I got the bed in the “bedroom” but the rest of the room is storage (she is a hoarder). Also my stuff is still unpacked since I moved back in, because she just doesn’t make any space for me - I moved back 4 months ago.

After a couple of days of braking up, I realised I feel better without the stress of paying rent, bills, and everything else, and that I just cannot go on without her, and won’t give up on our relationship because of my family. So we went back to dating, and it is better than ever.

Since I moved back in, my mom made me lose all the love towards her. When I tried to open up to her about my traumas, she told me stuff like - “I think u just want me all to urself but u can’t have that so u r frustrated”. She constantly tries to force me to talk to my stepdad and create a good relationship with him. I usually am away from early morning to 12pm studying, practicing, and doing different music projects, and I many times ask her to send me some money for food, so I can eat at least once a day, but she usually doesn’t send anything. The only way I can make her give me money is if I tell her I will give back later. My friends and girlfriend are still the ones who help me financially so I can afford food, cigarettes and having fun sometimes. My 18th birthday wasn’t long ago, and well…. I got like 200€ which I added to some other money I had so I can buy a saxophone ( I wished for one for years), but even this like 2 days after my birthday. On the actual day of my birthday I got a can of monster. This isn’t what bothers me, I never expect presents. It bothers me because my sisters get presents almost on the daily, they constantly get sets of legos and toys. They went on a trip to turkey not long ago, and they all got stuff from there (I didn’t go with them cuz of some events). They bought themselves really expensive perfumes, gadgets, clothes, but for me they brought a small bag of pistachios. About 2 weeks ago I went into a fight with my mom again, and told her that I am the only one to try and help her with her mental health and marriage, and I am the only person in her life that listen to her problems for hours. The answer she gave me was - “What did u help me with exactly?”. And this was the last drop. I broke. She deleted all the love and care I had for her. I am done with every member of this family. I am 18 at the moment, last year of high school. I am practicing as much as I can, working my ass of so I can get a job after finishing high school, and getting out of here. I don’t want to ever see them or talk to them after that.

Hello everyone!  What with the month of October upon us, I thought I'd share one of my custom scenarios that my table players loved, themed especially for this spooky month.

I ran this scenario last year for my group.  I may run another follow-up of this storyline this October, but for now I wanted to share this scenario with you so that you can adapt it for your own upcoming Halloween sessions.

This is meant to be adaptable to most tables, although the main NPC is designed unscaled and accordingly built on a Cyberpsycho Statblock.  So rather than give straight stats for that NPC, I'll post a recommended Creation breakdown, as well as recommended cyberware.  Most of the other NPC's that appear in the scenario are built on Hardened Mooks and Lieutenants.

__**The Setup**__

Devil's Night, October 30th, the night before Halloween, is an unofficial urban holiday celebrated throughout many portions of Night City, primarily the Red and Orange Zones.  It doesn't tend to be observed in the Green Zones, except for self-ironic Devil's Night greeting cards which are exchanged between frenemies and rivals.

Starting at sundown, the celebrations include drunken antics, revelry in the streets, acts of wanton violence, but more than anything else the celebrants partake in unrestrained arson and explosive urban renewal.  Notable participants in these celebrations include boostergangs such as Maelstrom, Red Chrome, Iron Sights, The Animals, The Bozos, and any other gang that shares a streak of anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment sentiment willing to do violence.

The celebrations typically focus on blighted areas that are in the midst of being gentrified and purchased on corporate investment, placing community reconstruction such as the Little China Redevelopment Project in Little China at considerable risk.  The most heavily celebrated (and devastated) district is South Night City, which is where much of our story will take place.

The mood and atmosphere for this scenario is meant to be one of urban blight, gothic eerieness, and hinting at supernatural activity that goes beyond the realm of human knowledge and experience.  Emphasize these details as the PC's go about the objectives, the aura of despair that lingers over the areas they visit, the sense of resignation or acceptance of a dark future that permeates every conversation, and the feeling that somehow, no matter where they go, the Crew is being watched.  Music is an important part of this scenario and we highly recommend playing in the background, tracks from The Cure, Nine Inch Nails, and if you don't mind being totally obvious, the soundtracks for the Crow and the Crow City of Angels, as well as the Original Score for The Crow by Graham Raevell.


*""People Once Believed That When Someone Dies, A Crow Carries Their Soul To The Land Of The Dead.  But sometimes, something so bad happens that a terrible sadness is carried with it and the soul can't rest. Then sometimes, just sometimes, the crow can bring that soul back to put the wrong things right.""*

__**Prologue**__

>!The Players will hear of a very lucrative gig that is being peddled by their most influential and reputatable Fixer.  If they have they trust and value their relationship with in their campaignm the GM is encouraged to use that Fixer.  Otherwise canon Fixer NPC's that might be appropriate include Rogue, Mister K, and Rex Royale.  It is important to the moral quandary later in Act 3 that the Fixer be one whose patronage and relationship with the Crew is considered valuable.!<

>!If the Crew agrees to hear the Fixer's offer, they will meet at the Fixer's preferred location, with the benefits of the HQ Lounge (No Place Like Home) applied to the Fixer during negotiations.!<

>!The Fixer will ask the Crew's knowledge of and give a brief rundown of Devil's Night, and what it means in the city.  They will state that the gig is a bodyguarding mission, meant to last a full 24 hours, with no breaks or rest times.  The protection detail starts at sundown on Devil's Night and proceeds until sundown on Halloween.  It requires a constant state of vigilance and alertness and the threat level is stated vaguely as being ""considerably dangerous"".  Combat abilities are a must-have.!<

>!If the Crew are even moderately wary or suspicious, they could attempt Human Perception checks on the Fixer, but the Fixer will only tell them that no one else would accept this mission, that everyone thinks of it as 'cursed', and advise that they wouldn't hold it against the Crew if they passed on accepting it.  However, the reward of the mission if successful, is in excess of a ""Very Dangerous"" payout, whatever scales best for your table.  If the Crew presses further, the Fixer will ask them if they accept, otherwise they cannot give any further details.  Once they accept, the Fixer will provide them with the name of the client, a once successful edgerunner named Skank, who is holed up in a private apartment-turned-fortress in the northern section of the Combat Zone of South Night City.  If pressed for who the threat is, the Fixer will look extremely uncomfortable, but whisper... !<

>!*""You should go ask the Vampires of the University District..  they can tell you more.  They have built up a sort of cult following around the story behind this ...'person'.*!<


__**Act 1**__
>!The Crew has two options at this time, the first being to go straight to meeting the Client, in which case they can wait until the appointed time and go straight to Act 2.  If however they decide they want more details, then this Act details the steps and sources they can follow to gain more knowledge about their client and the mysterious threat to his life.!<

>!Skills that will be of use in this section include:!<

>!* Library Search
* Conversation
* Interrogation
* Human Perception
* Conceal/Reveal
* Criminology!<

>!In addition certain Roles such as Media and Lawman may have an ""in"" regarding certain details.  It's up to the GM how slow a trickle of information they want to give, as most of this is purely backstory, but obviously amping up the sense of mystery and eerieness is important for the atmosphere of the story.!<

>!The majority of backstory will come from a few sources that the PC's can follow upon. !< 

>!* The Philharmonic Vampires!<

>!The first and most obvious are the Philharmonic Vampires, who are known to haunt the University District.  Though often portrayed as campy and fun-loving, in this scenario the GM should play up their strangeness and otherworldly nature, they should come across as enigmatic and cryptic, possessing a disturbing wisdom that most Night Citizens simply do not possess.!<

>!The Philharmonic will recieve the Crew cordially, unless they have a past history of attacking or wronging them, in which they will be deeply suspicious.  They can be found  after-nightfall in an all-night diner called ""Norman Lenny's"" in the University District.  They take up most of the back booths of the diner, but never seem to order any food, only black coffee.  Despite signs forbidding smoking, the Philharmonic are constantly smoking a mixture of course hand-rolled cigarettes or clove cigarettes.!<

>!The PC's should use what skills were noted above to try and coax information from the Philharmonics about what they might know regarding their mysterious protection detail.  The GM can have each of the Philharmonics speak in turn, pausing dramatically mid-speech and having each other finish their sentences, as if speaking in a hive-mind state.!<

>!What the Philharmonics know:!<

>!1. There's an urban legend out there, about a crooked crew of Edgerunners that **did VERY bad things*** to a couple that was stranded when their car broke down along the highway just outside of the city perimeter along Jackson Plains on the night before Halloween, that ended in the engaged couple's deaths.  Supposedly that crew all died mysteriously on Devil's Night some years back, except for one surviving member, named Skank.!<

>!2. People say that the bridegroom was an up-and-coming Rocker, a member of the Juliards, named Erick Raven.  His fiance was a local university student and Jode Nomad named Sheila Webster, who used to wait tables in this very diner. !<

>!3. Although there were no eyewitnesses to the deaths of the crew of Edgerunners, supposed the NCPD who came just in the aftermath reported seeing a gaunt and grim looking Mime with dead eyes emerging from the burning flames of the building where the crews' bodies were found.  The fires rose high into the sky and were in the shape of a crow.  !<

>!4. According to the legend, since the tragic couple were murdered on Devil's Night, the ghostly Mime comes back each year on Devil's Night to punish the wicked.  His presence is said to be preceded by a raven that flies overhead the city to spot the evil that men do.  But there are those that say, he's really looking for the one that got away.  He searches for the last surviving member of the men that murdered him and his fiance.!<

>!* The Juliards!<

>!The Juliards are the next obvious piece of the puzzle, and if the Philharmonics were disposed to be helpful to the PC Crew, they will tell them that they can find the Juliards often busking in front of the Boddukan Center for Performing Arts, in Japantown.  If they PC Crew made a good impression with the Philharmonic, they will warn the PC's that the Juliards are an insular and trigger-happy bunch, especially if they feel any street performer is threatened, regardless of Juliard membership.  They will warn the PC's that though they may look harmless, the Juliards have access to considerable tech from patrons and supporters of their performances.!<

>!1. The Juliards are a wary and suspicious bunch, and taking the hard approach with them might very easily result in a fight.  What makes them dangerous are the fact that they have a large number of supporters and fans watching their performances that can swayed with Charismatic Impact to take their sides and will protectively defend the Juliards from any aggression.  In addition, they have access to tech-upgraded gear and weapons, including weapons that are upgraded for concealability, reskinned as 'invisible' weapons that the Juliards mime using with empty-air melodramatics (which are obvious when in use) that shoot actual projectiles and do real damage.!<

>!2. The Juliards can be won over with a sympathetic approach and a 'patron donation' (Bribery DV13) of 500 Eddies.!<

>!3. Once the Juliards are well inclined towards the PC's, they will scoff with contempt at the story told to the Crew by the Philharmonics, and deride it as the vampires 'getting the story wrong as usual'.  They will further explain that while Erick and Sheila were real people, and members in good standing within the Juliards, they died in a far different manner than the legend tells.  They were fighting tenant eviction from a corporate redevelopment project on their flat in South Night City. (The GM is encouraged to link the corporation to an ongoing recurring corporate antagonist in their campaign)  !<

>!4. An edgerunner crew named the Thrill Kill Kult, a group of solos that hired out of the Forlorn Hope, who mostly worked numerous lucrative corporate jobs specializing as strikebreakers, union-busters, and company strongmen, broke into the couple's apartment and tortured, raped, and murdered Sheila while Erick was held down and forced to watch.  They then executed Erick with several point-blank shots to the head and chest, throwing his corpse out of the fourth story window onto the street below.!<

>!5. If asked by the Crew how they know all these details about the night Erick and Sheila were murdered, the lead Juliard will flatly say ""Because Erick told me.""  If pressed further he will have nothing more to say, and end the conversation by telling the PC's their next performance is about to start and the PC's should 'move along' so they don't scare away the audience.!<

>!* The NCPD!<

>!The PC's can try to get any public or sealed records regarding the murders of Erick and Sheila, possibly also following up on the NCPD and their reports of the deaths of the Thrill Kill Kult.  !<

>!1. The detective in charge of the investigation of the tragic couple was named Alden Aldretch, and he pushed for an aggressive investigation into who was behind the murders.  However for undisclosed reasons, his investigation was suppressed and he was demoted to patrolman after the case was suppressed.  He was also the first to respond to the scene of the Thrill Kill Kult's executions at their former warehouse headquarters on the border of the University District and South Night City. !<

>!2. Officer Aldretch is now retired, and living in a small flat on the edge of the University District and Little Europe.  If tracked down (Library Search DV15 or a Lawman can get his information), then Aldretch can be approached and convinced (Conversation or Interrogation) to tell them group what he knows.  He seems regretful about the tragedy that befell the engaged couple and says he was ""this close"" to uncovering a connection between the Thrill Kill Kult and who their corporate masters were.  He wishes he could have done more but that the past is long buried, and he's just content now with living out his life quietly in retirement.!<

>!3. If questioned about the Thrill Kill Kult's deaths, he becomes far more tight-lipped, and tries to imply it's best not to inquire further into that massacre.  Friendly conversation will will not get him to give that information up, but if the PC's try and strongarm him they may get him to whisper what he knows (Interrogation DV 17).  Aldretch arrived at the scene of a shootout at an abandoned warehouse, the headquarters of the Thrill Kill Kult and found a massacre of over forty dead ganggoons, along with four of the five members of the Thrill Kill Kult; Top Dollar, T-Bird, Tin-Tin, and Funboy; all dead with their eyes plucked out.  The walls were covered in bulletholes, from floor to ceiling, and some of the dead had been sliced apart, dismembered, or decapitated.  Aldretch remembers the scene with macabre horror.  He recalls that there was a gaunt figure watching from the rooftops, a painted mime with a black bird on his shoulder.  Then the building burst into fire, with the flames making up a bird-like outline. !<

>!4. Aldretch can give the PC's the address of the old HQ, and says the structure is still standing, caught up in bureaucratic red tape blocking the demolition of the building.  Everything from the crime scene was recorded then left untouched, save the bodies.  If they PC's wish to follow up they can investigate the scene (Criminology DV15), although many years have passed.  The bullet holes are still there, and there are still bloodstains on all the walls, ceiling, and floor.  The number of killed was not an exagerration, and the PC's can backtrack the flow of events, with one lone assailant managing to walk through the front doors, kill all ten guards at the entrance, then proceeding into the warehouse proper, taking a hail of gunfire in excess of 1200 bullets, and still surviving to kill over thirty ganggoons with a mixture of gunfire, sword cuts, and a pencil (still lodged halfway into a wall).  At the top level of the warehouse, the four members of the Thrill Kull Kult made their last stand, and were incapacitated, crippled and maimed, then slowly killed as their eyes were plucked out and they bled to death.!<

>!* The Forlorn Hope!<

>!If the PC Crew resarches more on The Thrill Kill Kult, their biggest lead is the Forlorn Hope.  A bar for Solos in the 2020's, it became an aid-station in the years following the Night City Apocalypse, finally returning to its roots as a bar for Solos in 2031.  Many of the original solos that frequented the bar are dead and gone, but some still remain and if encouraged with free drinks and some friendly conversation, they will recount that the Thrill Kill Kult was made up of some low-life mercenaries that made it big as solos after the War.  They went for big-money corporate jobs, and many opine that crews such as their gave a bad name to edgerunners and solos all round.  They are not fondly remembered, with comments of ""sellouts"", ""corpo-terrorists"", and ""jack-booted thugs"" being bandied about.  Skank apparently retired and went into hiding, using a fat corporate nest-egg to fund himself a personal fortress from which he never emerges.  The solos do wonder though, how he is still able to afford all of the defenses and upkeep on his hideout, after all these years.!<


__**Act 2**__

>!This segment will seem shorter and more of a set up, but because the foundation was mostly laid in Act 1, what follows here is the build up to the denoument, along with an opportunity for the PC Cree to get another side of the story, directly from Skank.!<

>!Meeting with Skank can only take place as the sun sets on Oct. 30th, the evening of Devil's Night.  Under no other circumstances will Skank's paranoia allow him to permit anyone else inside of his secure building, nor will he exit it.  The building is located on the edge of the University District and South Night City.  The 16 Freeway overpass runs right by the building, with a 20 meter gap between the two. !<

>!The entire structure has been built up and fortified, with security cages spaced out to break up each level of the building into a series of gated-locks, booby traps concealed into the veneer of the building's walls, floors, crowns and baseboards.  Turrets are likewise placed in concealed alcoves and ceiling tiles.  A secure NET architecture is run from the upper floors, with only one access node.  The stairwells of the building have been filled in and present false entrances and stairs that are actually death traps.  The only way between the ground floor, the second floor command center, and the third floor residence, is a architecture-linked elevator, which is also trapped with triggers to kill anyone without the right biometrics.!<

>!When the Crew is allowed entrance from the ground floor, they are first partitioned into a security cage, where they must allow themselvs to be photographed, have their biometrics recorded, and identities verified by Night City Social Identity Numbers.  From there, they are corralled through three security gates, finally ending at the elevator leading to the next floor.!<

>!The second floor is primarily a command center, consisting of the Net Architecture Server Room,  a security station with live feeds from Observation Cameras, and a Panic Room into which Skank can retreat to if the building comes under attack.  From inside the Panic Room, he can interface with the Access Node and control the building's defenses.!<

>!The third floor is Skank's residential quarters, consisting of a typical master bedroom, a guest room with two beds (for his temporary bodyguards), two bathrooms, a kitchen, a den room with pool table and card table, and a secret one-way trapdoor under Skank's bed that leads to the Panic Room on the second floor.  !<

>!The PC Crew can attempt to take shifts throughout the following 24 period.  It will be stressed that some of them are expected to be awake and alert throughout the entire period, and that even bathroom breaks and meal breaks must have at least one person guarding Skank, with the others easily roused on alert.  !<

>!Skank is realistic however, and accustomed to the perils of cabin fever and restlessness.  He will suggest games of eightball and card games such as gin rummy or poker to pass the time away.  If engaged with with, Skankt can be coaxed to talking about his past, and if lulled into a relaxed state, could be cajoled into telling his perspective of the events of Erick and Sheila's death.  (Conversation DV17)!<

>!Skank's recollection of the night's events are not entirely perfect, as he admits to being high on a mixture of Blueglass and Blacklace at the time.  But according to him, the entire venture to the apartment was supposed to be a cakewalk, with no expected encounters with any residents, who were reportedly going to be out at a concert performance for the entire evening.  The Thrill Kill Kult were instructed to infiltrate the residence, search for any legal papers relating to the legal motions to fight their eviction, plant false evidence implicating the couple as having accepted hush-money from corporate developers, and get out without anyone having been the wiser.  Unfortunately the couple came home earlier than planned, and stumbled upon the Kult as they were still searching the apartment.  Deeming Erick the greater threat of the two, T-Bird had him immediately incapacitated via paralytic dart, before instructing Tin-Tin to take the girl hostage.  Mistaking the Kult for simple low-lifes, Sheila attempted to bribe the Kult to let her and Erick go, first with money, then drugs, and finally by offering herself for their gratification in exchange for their lives.  Funboy Tin-Tin accepted the offer from Sheila for sexual favors, while Top-Dollar and T-bird were in disagreement about how to keep the couple quiet.  T-Bird wanted to go along with the ruse they were low-life addicts that broke in for a quick buck and easy high.  Top-Dollar felt that since they had been seen, the couple needed to be eliminated.  Skank tried to side with T-Bird, but was told to shut up by Top-Dollar.  However in the midst of their disagreement, Erick fought off the effects of the sedative, and in a rage immediately attacked Tin-Tin and Funboy in the midst of their congress.  Sheila tried to shield the still drug-hazy Erick from retaliation from an injured Tin-Tin and Funboy, but was mortally wounded in the process.  Alerted by the fighting, Top-Dollar made the decision to finish off Sheila, and execute Erick.  From there, the group covered their tracks to make it all look like a break-in gone wrong, and then left after leaving their fabricated evidence framing the couple for having taken corporate hush-money.  Less than a year after the events of that night, the Thrill Kill Kult began to fragment, going their separate ways.  Skank was not present when the Kult was reunited a year after, at the behest of Top-Dollar claiming he had secured a big fat contract that would take the Crew to the richest gigs and rewards, declaring they would be on easy street thereafter.  That meeting was when the Kult was ambushed and killed.!<

>!Throughout the entire 24 period, it's encouraged for the GM to make the PC's roll Perception checks, imply that they might hear something 'just in the other room', and otherwise create a sense of heightened awareness and paranoia.  Don't let them know what the results are, imply even that perhaps they saw something that could be meaningful.!<

>!Foremost during the build-up of revelations and interactions during this Act, it's incumbent on the GM to lay the seeds for what the PC Crew actually wants to do from this point on.  It should be pretty evident that Skank and his crew did horrible things, and are not good people.  It should be a moral quandary as to wether or not they are doing the right thing by protecting this weaselish man, and if it's worth potentially burning a bridge with their Fixer if they decide to compromise this mission.!<

>!The question of the urban legend of the ghostly mime should still be left in doubt.  Skank implicity believes he is cursed, and the killer of his former comrades is coming for him.  But Skank has no explanation for how one man could manage to kill forty gunmen plus his old friends and walk away from it all unscathed.  !<

>!Leave the Players guessing at this point.  Seed some doubts.  Maybe steer them towards rational explanations and examples, such as the legendary feats of Adam Smasher and Morgan Blackhand.  Compare and contrast their feats with the evidence they found at the warehouse, and let them drawn their own conclusions.!<

__**Act 3**__

>!This is the denoument and climatic conclusion to the Devil's Night drama.  A whole night and day have drawn to a close, and Devil's Night is about to give way to Halloween Night.  Children and teens are starting to venture out into the streets to trick or treat, in a variety of costumes, fantastical and morbid.  Have the Players make some more Perception Checks, but this time instead of being a red herring, narrate to them that they see a black bird perched on a lightpost outside, staring through the barred bulletproof windows.  If one of the PC's tries to alert another about the presence of the bird, when they turn to look at it again, it's vanished from view.  !<

>!It's at the this time that the doody should hit the air-circulator, and the players should be shocked into action as a loud roaring engine can be heard coming up the street paralleling the 16 freeway.  A black painted ground car approaches, windows tinted black, but the entire sides and body engulfed and wreathed in ghostly transluscent flames, with a fiery bird burning on the hood of the engine cowl.!<

>!This is Sheila's old nomad car, and it has been souped up with various upgrades, including but not limited to machine guns, heavy chassis, armored chassis, bulletproof glass, NOS, and a combat plow.  The vehicle will attempt to draw any fire from PC's in the windows, or the turrets outside under Skank's control.!<

>!This should continue inconclusively for 2-3 rounds, with the car withdrawing once it's taken enough fire to deal some damage past the armor.  If the PC's seem to be getting too confident, consider making a few more passes to test the defenses.!<

>!Skank displays himself as a coward by immediately running for the Panic Room and locking himself inside, even if the PC's advise him to stay by them.!<

>!Now comes the surprise.  After the testing feint and withdrawal, the vehicle will roar once more but this approaching from the 16 freeway overpass, and attempting to clear the distance and ram through the upper story walls.  It's entirely possible that with the damage bonus from NOS, the ramming damage will be enough to get through the walls entirely, otherwise it will lodge itself in partway and Erick will require an extra round destroying the remaining wall before he can proceed inside.!<

>!This is the start of the countdown before the sun completely sets and day turns into night.  Erick starts the ramming from the freeway with 1 minute (20 turns) to spare.  If he's delayed by the wall, account for losing an additional combat turn, possible two.!<

>!Describe Erick Raven thus:!<

>!*A lean, gaunt figure emerges from smoke and debris.  It might once have been living, though if it is alive now is difficult to determine.  Rather it resembles a starved famine victim or a concentration camp survivor.  A skintight performer's leotard clings to its emmaciated body, its face is bone-white and painted with a Greek Chorus's face paint, like a figure of tragedy and comedy mixed into one.  It is a macabre sight, like a human marionette moving of its own accord, eyes filled with hateful purpose.  A black bird, a crow, alights through the opening in the wall and lands upon its shoulder.*  !<

>!The PC's now have a fight on their hands.  Erick is meant to be a force of nature, and unscaled in relation to the PC's own skill levels.  If your PC's are very hardened, they can stand a chance of actually damaging Erick Raven, but his focus is actually not upon the PC's, but rather on getting to Skank and killing him.  Some PC's may try reasoning with Raven, but he cannot be entirely dissuaded, only delayed.  A PC who attempts to appeal to his sense of mercy, compassion, comparing what he does now with what Sheila would have wanted for him, stands an escalating chance of persuading Raven with a Difficult DV 15 Persuasion Check.  For every grade past Difficult (Professional, Heroic, Incredible, etc) the PC can manage to fill Erick Raven with enough self-doubt to delay him another combat turn.  The Panic Room's reinforced doors and walls are 50 SDP, enough to take Raven an average of about 4 attacks (2 turns) with his bare hands to break through.  Regardless of tactics, if Raven can be denied from actually killing Skank at the end of 20 turns, he will have no choice but to withdraw, resentful of his failure but resolving to try again next year.!<

>!If the PC's try to negotiate some kind of settlement with Raven, asking him to wait until after sundown, he will silently shake his head and imply that is simply impossible.  !<

>!If a PC attempts to engage Raven in a contest of wills, the GM may offer to allow a Facedown Challenge, in which Raven has an 8 Cool and a Reputation of 6.  If Raven is successfully Face-Down'd, he will not retreat, but will continue at a -2 penalty.!<

>!If the PC's offer to stand aside and simply let Raven have his vengeance, or even aid him in his quest, that is a perfectly viable outcome.  See the conclusions for how this might impact the Crew.!<

__**Epilogue**__


>!If Skank is killed despite the PC's best efforts, then they will have failed the assignment and their Fixer will express disappointment but not surprise.  The crew tried to do what common wisdom said was impossible and their Fixer will not hold it against them.  They will get a partial payment, equivilent to 500E$ or some replacement gear/resources if they expended any during the fight.  They won't suffer any hit to reputation, as nobody really expected them to be able to pull this off.!<

>!If the PC's opted to let Erick Raven kill Skank or even offer to aid him in his quest for vengeance, they will have failed the assignment and forego the compensation and reward they would have gotten from Skank surviving to see another day.  However, they will bear witness to Raven finally achieving peace, and he will thank them somberly and retreat back to the crashed car and drive it away.  They wont be able to claim much from the wrecked apartment safehouse, but as a result of helping a tormented individual find peace and justice, they will receive a single roll of Humanity restored (3d6) and possibly an ally for the future on Devil's Night.  Unfortunately this will be remembered by their Fixer and adjusts their reputation and street credit detrimentally.  Consequences from an unhappy Fixer are sure to follow.!<

>!If the crew successfully fought off Erick Raven and kept Skank alive, they will get the full reward from their Fixer (at least 1500E$ each) and a possible favor from Skank that they may claim for future gear, corporate influence, etc.  But they will also take a hit of -1d6 to Humanity as a result of contributing to the erosion of the human spirit, and the rise of corporate brutalism.  However their reputatiom will gain a boost, being raised to Rep 6 if below that number, and Rep 7 if already at 6.!<


__**NOTES:**__

>!Erick Raven is built to be suggestive of the supernatural without breaking the spirit of gothic noir that borders Cyberpunk.  As a result, almost everything he does can be potentially explained away by existing technology in the setting, but with a veneer of ""could it be a ghost?"" and doubt spread over it all.!<

>!Because groups and crews can vary widely, my suggested stats and gear for Raven are as follows:!<

>!* Use the Major Hero Creation Point Spread under Complete Character generation.!<

>!* Treat Raven as a Full-Body Conversion Cyborg.  Make sure to read up on all immunities and special rules for FBC's.!<

>!* Raven has an internal linear frame.  For lower power groups, a sigma is more than adequate.  For hardened groups, a Fūma Kotarō would be most appropriate.  For more Challenge, a Tech-Upgrade Invention raising his body to 13 could be appropriate. !<

>!* It is strongly recommended that Raven be outfitted with cybereyes, including Low-Light/UV/IR, Enhanced Imaging, and VIC Jammers.!<

>!* Tech-Upgraded Subdermal Armor with at least one Trauma Nano Matrix, more would be appropriate.!<

>!* Three applications of FBC Chameleon Covering.!<

>!* The 'Crow' accompanying Raven should be treated as a Savannah Eagle Drone!<

I hope you've enjoyed this scenario.  It was one of my favorite to run, and I aimed it more at creating a sense of atmosphere and mystique, rather than be a dice-fest.  You may have noticed that the last Act in particularly is very open and light on combat-systems.  This is to account for the wide range of groups and also encourage roleplaying exploration, even if there's conflict.  

I'd love to know if you will try this out for Halloween, and let me know how it goes!",1,1728343657.0,cyberpunkred,0,1.0,False

I hope it's nice where you are and I hope the sun shines and that it's a beautiful day. 

Not sure what this post will bring, but, maybe it's you? Just looking to chat with different kinds of like-minded people and see where things go - zero pressure or expectations, just organic conversation. 

Someone witty, genuine, comfortable in their own skin, and just down to earth. 

A little about me:

I work from home full-time. I'd love to share the little mundane details of my day with you and in turn, ask you all about yours and question whether you've eaten today, because, I care and worry a lot lol (!!).

Qualities that are important to me? Hmm, loyalty, consistency; open, honest communication; the ability to make me laugh (hard and often, preferably); patience, kindness, and a genuine desire to learn who I am as a person.

Being self-aware, compassionate, and empathetic are also super important and attractive qualities to me. I try to be kind to everyone I meet. With that said, I was voted most likely to say, ""I wish you the best,"" knowing damn well I hope you go to hell. Life's about balance, not perfection ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

I think I'm an extroverted introvert - I do really well in social settings, but more often than not, I'd prefer just being home in my own space. With that said, I'm always down to travel, checkout new restaurants, museums, aquariums, the zoo, farmers markets, book stores, quaint coffee shops, and the like. In my free time, if I'm not working out or hanging out friends/family, you can find me at a gig of playing a game.

6ft tall. Fit, have dark features, beard, and tanned skin. Educated. Knows which utensil to use for which food (humble brag). Emotionally stable. No kids but definitely the fun uncle.

You are single, kind, preferably remember what life was like before the internet, and text with purpose. I don’t care what you look like or what you do for a living. Just be yourself, and we'll be good

Also, I'm in the UK but open to connections from anywhere in the world.  

Thanks for taking the time to read this. If anything in this post resonates with you, feel free to reach out. 

I look forward to the banter :)",0,1728343654.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.5,False
1fylrgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1fylrgx/the_sandwich_heirachy/,The Sandwich Heirachy,"So I got into work this Monday, and was greeted with two lovely new policies. Firstly, the previously open doors into and throughout the office have all been locked behind an ID card key scanner. Sure sure, security and that, but we have a well-manned reception area and now my coffee machine is behind a gate. There are big paper printouts that say ""No tailgating!"" to ensure every person swipes every single door. Can't shake the feeling that this tech is going to be used to track my tardiness and smoke breaks, but hey I can live with it.

The one that really got me though, is that they've suddenly imposed a literal hierarchy on who has access to the sandwich van at lunch time. 

The company office is already arranged with the C-suite and HR on the top floor, then software developers middle floor, and tech support bottom floor. I did think this was a little gross while joining, but ultimately excusable because its a practical solution to be physically closest to the people you work closest with.

As of today, can you guess in which order we're being ""allowed"" to go buy our own food to eat on our lunch break? Well, the top floor gets first access to the sandwich van of course! Unfortunately it has quite a limited stock, as it's the only delivery service around the bumfuck-nowhere industrial estate we're located in. Next the second floor gets their turn, then lastly the bottom floor (where coincidentally, more people work than any other floor).

The instigating message from HR claimed that this change was intended to ""reduce the chaos of the lunchtime queue"". We're fucking British. There has never been a single issue with employees queueing to get lunch - there are a fair few of us going at once, but there's a whole car park we can wait in.

Is it just me or is this fucking Orwellian?

(If you're wondering, I'm a dev on the middle floor. Almost sent a reactive Teams message to protest but decided to try ""proper channels"" before blowing up the group chat lol)",12,1728343387.0,antiwork,9,0.94,False

I get my cold brew and leave, and I didn’t think until later today to check my online receipt (they didn’t offer me a printed one). Turns out, they used my stars on some random chai latte that I didn’t order, and they charged me for my drink through my Starbucks app. Part of me thinks they put the drink in my order for themselves, and because I didn’t go through the effort of checking my receipt, they got away with it. I had to go through customer service to get my stars back. To whoever stole those stars, I’m pretty sure that’s sketchy work, and it would probably get you fired because those aren’t your stars.

1fylnjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1fylnjl/alert_for_a_long_text_dont_read_if_it_bothers_you/,"📌Alert for a long text! Don't read if it bothers you, of course.(My therapist asked me to tell the story I used the same text) I have some doubts about my ex-boyfriend's manners. By demanding responsibilities from him, could I have triggered narcissistic behaviour? ","My F32 ex-boyfriend M39 (he is in a autistic spectrum, maybe this information is relevant, given that the topic is behavior.) seemed an introvert when I met him so I took the initiative of contacting also kissing on our first date, after a few weeks talking, which he later told me he took as a red flag; he told me that for him, things worked by going out for *""a coffee, then another coffee, and another coffee, and then...""*  He didn't finish the sentence, but it made me thoughtful because he had told me that in our previous conversation he had only been with only one person before me,  (in terms of kissing or having sex) according to him. But that day we repeated many times and after we left each other to go home, we kept talking and he told me it was nice and enjoyable;
On our second date, he said he already felt like he was in a relationship. Caveat: We were both equally open to it. The enthusiasm in the conversations was mutual, as it was for the schedules initially. But soon after, some arguments arose when I started to question him after observing some behaviours such as omissions, inconsistencies and a few lies. I think the justification for that may go beyond insecurity. Eg.: telling me he needed to go out to buy something when he was actually going out for a coffee with a friend.  At first, that was somewhat understandable, but as time goes on, it's natural we get more confident and leave the excuses. But it wasn't what happened in so many cases.
So I observed behaviours like that and would point them out to him with the intention of helping him understand that he could be transparent with me about what he wanted/needed, and that I would understand him.
And I kept realising that, and trying to do the same, so I was getting frustrated but I was trying to show him the best way would be to communicate better, and I asked for that several times. We just started having arguments. 
Then he would stop responding to my messages or would reply with gaps of several hours, which was not usual, however I assumed it was a little because of his autism (I mean the fact he chose to be quiet and refusing any type of communication, I got it as a difficulty to face the conflicts in order to solve them as I read). On the other hand, it seemed like an attempt at emotional manipulation. I started feeling like he was trying to manipulate me over time with silent treatments, in order to condition me to accept that kind of behavior. He said he distanced himself because I was being accusatory, but he refused to have any clarifying things properly, giving  short and evasive answers only, followed by silence and later saying he didn’t want to talk about that matter. Eventually, he refused to discuss anything related to us, claiming that I only talked about that, but that's not true, because we connected in the first place with common interests. I was insisting on clarification because it was bothering me, obviously.

I wrote to him several times in an attempt to resolve that because he refused to call or talk personally claiming to feel uncomfortable. 
He started saying I was just  interested in emotional drama and that I was being abusive, which sounds like gaslighting to me.
In order to break that loop, I invited him to reflect and ask himself why things were happening that way. And after some other unpleasant events, I suggested we go to therapy with the same professional. At one point, he briefly said he would think about it, but later replied that he didn’t want to.

Let's go back in time for a while: Knowing he had previously used dating apps, one day I asked if he still used them. Not only did he tell me he wasn't using that, but he also made a gesture of handing me his phone as proof that there was nothing there. That alerted me because it doesn't take much intelligence to know that doesn’t serve as proof. A few days later, I asked again, and then he told me that after one of our early arguments, he stopped believing our relationship would work and simply went back to using dating apps. So yes! He had underestimated my intelligence by handing me the phone then. 

Similar things happened regarding conversations with ""other people,"" and what seemed to me like simple things that could be resolved through dialogue became triggers for avoidance. He told me that when ""I started being like that,"" his mind started to go in other directions. I also heard something like ""I did things that must have discouraged you, and you didn’t leave."" Would that be an implicit hint? Why didn't he tell me what he wanted then? What do my readers understand as ""other directions""? HOWEVER...  I asked a few times if he wanted to continue meeting/getting involved with other  people because he conveyed this in previous conversations about people 
he was talking to when we met and his answer was: ""Sigh"", ""I'm not doing this conversation anymore, let's talk about music"", or simply nothing. So he never gave me the confidence that he had stopped talking to ppl who he used to flirt with. He even said he was still having some conversations with one of them  at some point (by the way, the one he had shown attraction for, and according to him, it wouldn’t work out because he had a “sexual hobby” that didn’t work for him, but he continued talking to her because he wanted to understand what she wanted from him. That was also during our relationship) I naturally asked questions about his feelings/ intentions towards that person (She lives at the same country he was going to live for a couple of months for some specific reason, well.... It's natural since he told me he started talking to them during the days we were in bad vibes. So he said I was jealous and he simply adopted an: ""I'm not talking to anyone,"" as a standard response for anything that referred to a similar subject.

*Just one more topic about ""I'm not talking to anyone"" Once, during one of our conversations when he was in a good mood, he mentioned that he basically only talked to family members and three friends, and months before he had said he had two or three female friends who lived in the UK / Corea and it was very rare for him to talk to them. I felt that his tone was defensive, which conveyed more insecurities. I don’t want to sound like a judgmental fool, but I will point out a few things and leave it to the reader to draw their own conclusions. The person had 'theoretically' stopped using dating apps after having used them for several years. He considers himself a nerd, and much of his life is online, with several social media accounts. It’s a bit strange to say he limits himself so much in chats. I asked a few questions trying not to sound invasive, but that’s the response I got. And then: I saw a few conversations, when he opened his Instagram one of them with a girl (from USA) btw and reactions with ""♥️"" although the subjects at least at that moment, the topics were generic. Discouraged, I just said in a sarcastic tune: *""Anyone is too little!""* He called me jealous, claiming they were just friends.. Actually the conversations were about general stuff. I don't believe that girl would even be interested in him in a romantic way (for reasons that I won't elaborate on further) but the conversation seemed very ""enthusiastic"". Before ppl ask me how I could see that and call me invasive.... I asked him for that and he showed me. 
And he told me: she’s my friend. (Wtf?) Further down, there were 3 or 4 more chats with girls, and I asked about the one closest to the bottom (he had done the same thing with me before when he saw my chat open, and I responded without any issues. The difference is that I never said I didn’t talk to anyone; on the contrary, I even mentioned a male friendship I made through a dating app in the past).

At the bottom was a conversation with one of his former students. Hey, it’s fine to have friendships with the opposite sex, but when you start hiding it... Bro? Why the insecurity at this level? Could they have been the targets of some previous flirting? (Maybe not just 'previous' 🤔)""
But my point wasn’t about the people or the conversations with them because of jealousy simply. Actually it was more related to the fact that he was always on the defensive, giving evasive answers and inconsistent justifications in various aspects of our conversations about topics like that. He used to say he basically was talking to five other people. I just asked him things like that because of the other manners, I already started to think that he was maintaining the relationship with me because it was 'real' at the moment, but he wanted to keep the possibility of something better or simply 'something' in case things didn’t work out between us. The traditional game of those who embrace the idea of fluid relationships. 
Could this behavior be partly related to the difficulty of resolving conflicts? That's it: instead of having a conversation with me about what was bothering him and what was bothering me, he simply tried to sweep it under the rug and avoid me. I struggled to believe that someone I admired precisely for showing me that they were above various types of behavioral neglect was choosing that path.
 I was kind of waiting for the person to face the reality because some behaviours seemed childish and therefore incompatible with the part of his personality that made me get interested. He used to present good arguments and articulated consistently on the general topics we discussed, which made our connection enjoyable initially.
 We enjoyed a good moment together of course.
Things heated up between us, like with any couple. The difference was that, by his choice, we didn’t have privacy, and he only agreed to go out in public places. That was okay for me, but after a few months, I suggested doing something different, like going camping or going somewhere that would allow us more privacy. This wasn’t necessarily for having sex, but we always went to pubs, for a walk in town, or to parks, which, although still public places, allowed us a few minutes of 'peace.'

We  had sex only once, for literally 3 seconds, and it caused him extreme concern about the condition of the condom (which was intact and fine) and a huge paranoia about all the negative possibilities.
We did that in a place without total privacy, and he was so worried while I was trying to calm down he disclaimed about the spot - a park -  but that was the only option we could think about. (📌 On that day, we had gone to that place somewhat prepared for it, and he even made some funny comments about it. I felt a bit embarrassed, but I was okay about it.)

After that, he told me he wouldn't be prepared to do that again anytime soon, I said ok but I didn't understand such a big block around it since he told me I used to make him uncontrollably horny and sex would be something dangerous. 
Days later he said something like ""I want you"", ""let's do whatever you want"", "" let's have sex"". He had a few beers that day and the next day he sounded like his changed his mind a little and in some time later he sent me a 15-min You-Tube video containing some basic principles of Geomancy. He told me he had asked some questions during that practice about whether he should have sex with me or not. He was looking for answers regarding a decision about a trip he was going to take related to professional matters.

I was willing to have patience with almost everything that would be different for me, but no cheating. I basically found myself wrestling with someone else's partially fictional universe.

He said emphatically: ""You ruined everything"" was his sentence when he saw me struggling against an end in that condition, bc letting a lack of communication create a society of monsters to destroy expectations and good feelings becomes sad, poor, even ridiculous. That's my ""doubt"" (if I really can call it doubt) because that represents a weak manipulation tactic usually used by neurotypicals lacking emotional intelligence or / and respect, but technically that doesn’t match him because he usually analyzes facts and situations more intelligently, in a high level common sense, I would say. At the same time I’m talking about a person who *literally* ran away a few times when I sought him out to have a conversation. 

Later, he started engaging in apparent narcissistic games, like singing while I was talking to him (I understand he was anxious about making a difficult decision for him in those days, but…) He complained that I only wanted to talk about relationship issues while he preferred to talk about movies or music, which sounded a bit bizarre to me; I wasn’t talking about problems because I enjoyed it but because I found it necessary to  clarify what was bothering me. And he seemed to start hating me and for a while I felt the same.

There were times when I went to see him (without us schedule it and I know that's not the best thing to do but he just stopped talking once again, I was sad, because I know there's a lot of better ways to solve that. I just wanted to have a decent conversation. Although I understood he got nervous and anxious with our issues.
One day I approached him saying, ""Hi, I'd like to talk. I know you're uncomfortable, but can we at least have a brief conversation?"" He seemed to hate me at that moment, but I insisted, telling him how disproportionate it was imo. He certainly interpreted many things from my side in a way that I didn't intend. He even said a few times he was paranoid; 
Naturally, people ask why I stayed. I wish I could have done something to change that *because/however/although* I can't see a logical reason for that set of strange manners. I got irritated in the process, and I made mistakes in how I treated him too, but nothing unforgivable to the point where I didn’t get any response, even if neutral.
So he told me that if I didn't leave, he would notify the police. I laughed ironically, but in a state of perplexity. Really? Something we could clear up over coffee, talking like the 30+ year-old adults we are. He started laughing in a strange way—nervous, sarcastic—and turned the corner. I asked where he was going, and he answered, ""To the police station."" I said, ""Really? I’ll go with you, and we can clarify the exact reasons driving you to do this, right?""
I couldn’t understand what led him to this extreme but wouldn’t allow him to have a conversation with me as the situation required. There were no screams, no violence, no offense or anything that would make the involvement of a police officer necessary imo. 
He claimed that I was ""following"" him. It was: I went to meet him on the same path we used to take when he was coming back from work. It was our way to the train station. We had an arrangement, and apparently, he wasn’t keeping it. I believe I had the right to understand what was going on. Simply blaming me, saying I was ruining the relationship, was neither fair nor sensible. I had some indications that he was seeing other women.
I never made any comment that would make him think it was a criterion for me that a man should only have had one woman /s or that he couldn't go out with a friend, or that someone couldn't have had a past or other loves. 

He also told me he felt threatened by the tone I used when I let him know I found out where he lives. 📌There we go: : we don’t live far from each other, there’s just one neighborhood separating ours, and a friend recognized him because he had seen us together and asked if I knew, and I responded that I only knew the general area. My friend was even a bit surprised because most people in relationships usually visit each other’s homes. But in our case, he would feel awkward about his parents and there are other implicit factors, like him having thought I might have some material interest, a different nationality, given that he also made it clear he held some prejudice toward people of my nationality (yeah... I know). This would be another barrier for certain things. I know that the way he processes some thoughts is very different from mine, and I let a lot of things slide because I believed time would help him feel more at ease with me. But his behavior went from 100 to 0 in some aspects towards me. The conversations got a strange tune, he started frequently giving up on our schedule; apparently, the inconsistencies about trivial day-to-day things were increasing in proportion.
There was a moment when we reconciled, and we exchanged an ""I love you,"" which once again came from me, but he reciprocated. Also, one day, when I suggested I might leave the country, he said he felt wrecked, empty... 
My understanding of that guy's motives fluctuates as much as his emotions and feelings, I think. In part, he was afraid of being left, so he preferred to do it first, as he did but in the process, he decided to inflate his ego by showing narcissistic traits. Did he use the fact that I chose to stay and try to fix things as a means to inflate his ego, seeing the opportunity to cheat?
He justifies the feelings I had for him by saying that this was the result of magic spells he did before we met. 
I've already put myself in his shoes several times, but I don’t know if he has the same ability. 
I was disappointed and perplexed by his reaction to my attempt to talk + he had said that his friends advised him to stay away from me. Did his account contain valid justifications for my dissatisfaction? I don't think so
So I wrote a text similar to this one for his friend, slightly shorter than this, telling what would be 'my version' of the events. And probably now he hates me because of that. 
Any comments on the subject are welcome, except about the length of the text, as I'm aware that it’s worthy of a magazine article, lol

⬇️Phrases he told me more than once that, in my opinion, convey superficiality/immaturity and don't align with his manners:
1. ""You are attractive, who would leave you?""
2. ""You are attractive, no one would cheat on you.""
3. ""I never cheated.""

1fylmhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1fylmhn/no_bs_degree_in_coffee_making/,No BS degree in coffee making,"So I was fresh out of college (many years ago) and had an engineering job in a small company. I had been there a little over a year and was learning many aspects to my job. That included shop floor work, small project supervision, learning customers, and technical support (manufacturing and sales). Small company, so I wore a lot of hats. It was rewarding, and I learned a lot in my time there. 

However, at this point in the job, I had a boss that thought college grads were punks and didn’t have common sense. He reminded me regularly his high school GED was good enough for that company and he was a manager without a degree. I always smiled and kept learning the business and making strides with the work force. 

On this particular day, we had important customers coming in for a quarterly review. Execs and management had set up the conference room and a few of us, including my boss arrived early. He surveyed the room and noted that we needed coffee. I volunteered to get the admin assistant, but in front of everyone he told me something to the tune of: “Well college boy you should be smart enough to make coffee. Don’t bother the admin assistant, YOU go do it!”

Background: I am not a coffee drinker. I do not know how to make coffee other than one would add water and coffee to the machine. (Which I’ve never done because I don’t drink coffee!) But I do understand the concept.  

I tried to explain I had never done this before. But he made more references to “college boy” and “smarts”. 

So, embarrassed by his statements (and there was actually more to it, and some ribbing laughter as I left) I went to the break room to make coffee. Again, let me state I don’t do coffee. I looked at the BUNN machine. Easy enough, water goes in one area. Check. A filter fits in a plastic holder. Check. Coffee goes in the filter. Ummm .. how much coffee? I can hear everyone yucking it up in the conference room, so I didn’t want to ask. And the coffee was kept in a sterile container with no instructions. So, I filled the whole filter up .. to the top. Coffee in! Check. Flip the brew switch, and it starts the process. Soon the smell of coffee is in the air. 

Boss comes in with a couple of people. They grab cups and promptly start to guzzle … STRONG COFFEE!! My boss turns red and spots his out loudly, then cussed me as the admin assistant and the company president walk into the room. (The other guys kept sipping.) As my boss is flustering, the president takes a cup and gets a pour, while my boss is telling him not to. The president takes a sip, tilts his head, looks at me and said it reminded him of college finals week. Then told my boss he’d talk to him after the meeting. The admin assistant assured me all is well, then diluted the coffee and served it without anyone complaining. My boss just stared at his feet the whole two hours. 

Me: I was never asked to make coffee again. U",55,1728343000.0,pettyrevenge,10,0.94,False

Enjoy losing your primary source of desserts,"This isn't my personal story, but I wanted to share it. Obligatory English is not my first language, so I apologize in advance for any mistakes.

My friends M and B are super talented cooks, B is actually a chef and M is working towards her PHD but loves to cook. They are both awesome and great people.

Well, they had this client Karen (not the real name) who is the owner of a well known coffee shop in their city. She would buy cheesecakes from them every week, because M and B's cheesecakes are the best, nice texture, flavorful but not overly sweet, suffice to say they are delicious.

At first Karen would buy 1 or 2 every now and then but soon she was buying 4 to 5 every week, her clients can't get enough of those cheesecakes. Karen tried multiple times to replace M and B's desserts but nothing came even close, their recipe is a result of years of experience and talent, they even gave Karen some tips but she just couldn't replicate it.

Now, a normal person would think that maintaining a good relationship with the suppliers is mutually beneficial but not Karen. She would complain for everything hoping to get a discount or free product. She would get so mad when the prices raised but it was inevitable because the cost of the  materials to make the cheesecakes also increased every year. IMHO the price for the cheesecakes was more than fair if not on the lower side but Karen didn't care.

One time she sent a picture of a cheesecake with all of the jam on the side complaining they delivered it that way or that it happened overnight with no explanation (?), but M and B always deliver their desserts personally and with a transparent cover, the only logical explanation was that one of Karen's employees (or Karen herself) tipped it and wanted to replace it for free. Obviously my friends didn't replace it because they were sure it wasn't their fault.

Another time she sent M a message complaining about a hair in one of the cheesecakes, now my friends are very careful with hygiene and always clean their workspace, B is extremely clean (to the point it could be a different issue lol) but still M decided to apologise and thank Karen for the notice and promised to be more mindful about it.

Things came to a head when they made their last delivery to the coffee shop, all of Karen's employees were giving M and B dirty looks and whispering that no one was to pay them until the boss (Karen) arrived. They made my friends wait like half an hour until she arrived. Then she grabbed the hair she supposedly found on the cheesecake and proceeded to lecture M and B infront of her employees clearly trying to humiliate them. The hair wasn't even theirs, M has long brown straight hair while B has short thick dark curly hair, the hair Karen showed them was blonde thin and curly.

The worst part is that my friends could see that none of Karen's employees were wearing hair nets and there was a big golden retriever laying Infront of the kitchen's doorway, really cute but that's no place for a dog. My friends were mortified and stunned, in the moment they said nothing to Karen and just left after collecting the payment. Usually they are very confrontational but they wanted to remain professional. 

Now, here comes the petty revenge, M and B waited until Karen asked for more cheesecakes to tell her 'business is now closed, sorry for the inconvenience~' Karen freaked out and said they should have warned her beforehand just to be left on read.

Note: this wasn't a formal contract just a verbal agreement with Karen. Baking desserts is only a side hustle for my friends on top of their regular jobs/studies. Nice extra money but not indispensable.",417,1728342963.0,pettyrevenge,21,0.99,False

1fyljmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Temple/comments/1fyljmx/condescending_guide_to_making_friends_in_college/,Condescending Guide to Making Friends in College,"**I've seen a lot of posts lately from people looking for friends. Here's a very rudely-worded FAQ guide for y'all**

* *“I’m just too weird, autistic, ugly, nerdy, etc.”*

You’re not in high school anymore. People will like you for who you are, and if they don’t, there are literally thousands of other people to choose from. All the cheesy advice people have given you, like “just be yourself”, which didn’t work in high school, works as an actual adult. If you want to skateboard up to the lecture hall in a steampunk top hat with a My Little Pony backpack, triangle-shaped sunglasses, and oversized rainbow-colored crocs in the middle of winter, as long as you’re living your best life, you’re fucking cool. People are too busy to be judgmental or micromanage your style.

College is for finding out who you are and what you like. Your brain is still reconciling with its own identity, and will continue to throw shade at you for the next 2-4 years until you finally stop thinking there’s something wrong with you because you didn’t immediately meet billions of high-quality friends in the first few weeks who will then go on to become life-long companions. That’s not a realistic expectation to hoist upon yourself. Loneliness is a club, and everyone is in it because they don’t charge cover on \**checks calendar\** Mondays. Just because you don’t have a ton of new friends already doesn’t mean you aren’t in the club. The social butterflies who aren’t struggling at all to adjust are the real weirdos. 

* *“But everyone else already seems to have made friends and I’m still alone”*

No, every other freshman except for you hasn’t already found their permanent friend groups for the rest of their lives. Believe it or not, you are still allowed to meet new people even in your second, third, fourth, or super senior™ year. There isn’t a deadline. 

What you’re seeing is either upperclassmen who have already been here a while and just look younger because of some secret Korean skincare routine with 501 steps, or more likely, clusterfucks of random freshmen who were in the same place at the same time. They aren’t just naturally more likable than you, and not being in a “group” doesn’t mean you don’t have friends. Half of these people will inevitably drop out or transfer before the end of year one, anyway. If you’re planning on actually studying 🤓 and going through with your degree, people are gonna come and go. That may sound a little scary because in high school, you had the same friend group for four years, but now everyone has different schedules and routines.

* *“I just don’t know how to meet people who share the same interests”*

It’s fine to have a provisional friend group. Smoking buddies, coffee buddies, drinking buddies, study buddies, random people from the Discord who are nothing like you. Are you enrolled in a class? WOW! You have so much in common with Namey McNameface, who sits right next to you. By some wild coincidence, you both have the same passion for ✨Intro to Psych✨. Maybe you should talk to them. Every person you meet has social connections, so even if you don’t wind up remaining friends with every Andy you talk to, you might just find out that Andy’s friend is cooler than he is, or Andy’s friend’s friend is cooler than her. Whatever. The point is, there’s an infinitely extending web of people, so you don’t need to make a conscious effort to maintain friendships with every single person in your cute little freshman clusterfuck. Relationships are built over time. They don’t happen overnight. It’s completely fine and normal to hang out with people you don’t really love, **or** to *stop* hanging out with people you’re no longer vibing with. You aren’t going to run out of options. 

Join a club, I guess, if you feel like it. The importance of this is really exaggerated though. And I’m not your mom, so I can’t tell you what to do. 

* *But I’m too shy to approach people I don’t know yet”*

Then I guess you’ve never spoken to anyone except mommy and daddy before. This is why I invented alcohol. It’s this cool bottled courage juice that poisons your liver. For legal reasons, I am not condoning underaged drinking. You know when that Australian guy on the TV says “snakes are more scared of you than you are of them”? You might be a little spooked when it comes time to put yourself out there, but brother, it’s spooky season, and everyone’s down for a little companionship jumpscare. Just be cognizant if you’re approaching people you might have other types of feelings for that you aren’t coming off as *sexually* creepy, but it’s actually not illegal to just walk up to a human person on the street and talk to them. 

* *“I’m a commuter student, tho. How am I supposed to socialize?”*

Actually a fair point. Commuter students are completely unlovable.   
*-Signed, a commuter* 

* *“I tried all this and I still don’t have friends”*

Then be more patient. Jeez. They aren’t Pokémon. Quit worrying so much, get 8-10 hours of sleep, drink water, charge your phone, be bisexual, eat hot chip, and lie.  The friends will appear when you least expect it, like thieves in the night.",31,1728342778.0,Temple,11,0.92,False

We work in a corporate complex that has three buildings. In the lobby of one of these buildings, the office management has installed those crazy expensive machines that can make lattes, mochas, espresso, etc. with the push of a button. Most of our permanent office employees tend to enjoy the walk to the other building to use the really nice machine (most of us prefer espresso or cold brew over the Keurig brews). Our individual office kitchen coffee machine tends to be used moreso by our office guests (we host onboarding classes in our space about 2-3 times a week).

The question is: for our individual office coffee machine replacement, does it make more sense to just get the exact same Keurig? Does anyone have any recommendations for a machine that can brew individual cups through relatively inexpensive pods but also can potentially brew cold coffees or might have a separate espresso feature?

I take 450mg bupropion XL and 52mg methylphendate ER (concerta) for depression and ADHD, both well-managed. For reflux I take 60mg dexilant and carafate TID. I am not a smoker, I don't drink alcohol or coffee.

I am so desperate to improve my quality of life. My severe reflux started very suddenly around July 2022 after my first covid infection. I started the bupropion about a year before that with no reflux then\*. I have never in my life had any problems with reflux or any GI issues at all, prior. Aside from bad pre-menstrual symptoms my medical history is unremarkable. I do not have any ""long covid"" symptoms, it's just this reflux.

\*Depression is not new for me. I had been on bupropion for years in my 20s.

Based on what I've read, what I have sounds more like ""LPR"" where I only feel my symptoms in my esophagus (no heartburn). I am almost always nauseous to some extent, I get regurgitation all day every day, burps, constant phlegm and drip, hoarseness, cracks around my nostrils, hypersalivation that's so bad I'm drooling into a washcloth all day at times. The lymph nodes in my neck are noticeably swollen right now after a really bad flare up. (I saw my PCP and got imaging done to rule out a lot of concerns, we think it's reflux.) I had to leave my job because my symptoms make doing routine things impossible at times. I hardly go out or see friends anymore because I have to cancel more often than not.

I am so, so, so desperate to end this nightmare of two years.

I have a GI doctor and have an ENT referral in place with an appointment in Dec. I have a pH study scheduled in Nov. I had an endoscopy a year ago which showed an irregular z line and evidence of chronic reflux, but no real helpful finding. It did rule out celiac. No *H. pylori*. No hiatal hernia (at least a year ago).

Things I've tried:

* Acid-watcher diet and prolonged bland diet, no change at all. I still avoid ""the dirty dozen"" regardless.
* Wedge pillow, no difference.
* Every PPI. Every one of them, and they've made no difference. I take Dexilant anyway.
* Famotidine, which gave me hives and I don't think it helped.
* OTC medications none of which have made a difference: Gaviscon, Pepto, Tums, others I'm surely forgetting
* Stopping psych meds with help from my psych. No difference with the methylphenidate (was able to stop it for months) but I was only able to be off bupropion for about a month before I had to restart due to depression.
* Home remedies like apple cider vinegar, ginger capsules, that kind of thing. No difference.

I'm at the point where I'm doing the testing needed for a surgery consult and ultimately considering a fundoplication if I'm a good candidate for one. I DO NOT WANT THIS. I'm an otherwise healthy 32 year old and this has destroyed my life.

I'm trying to stop the bupropion one more time (working with my psych) to see if my body needs longer without it, if maybe it's the cause. I'm scared it'll just add depression on top of reflux but I have to try.

Is there anything else I can do? Is there anyone familiar with something like this? Should I be seeing a covid specialist or something? I want to live my life again.",1,1728342362.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False
1fyle5n,https://v.redd.it/5zcgc7201ftd1,Slow trickle or nothing from machine.   (Illy x1 ese ground and pod anniversary edition) ,"
I have this machine and I don’t recall having issues when I bought it and slowly developed I believe.   I dont drink espresso all the time so it is infrequently used The machine is barely 2 years old.   When I put the proper amount of illy coffee in the basket as directed, that the coffee starts to come out then slows to a trickle and then nothing.  Just the noise of the machine trying to pump.    After that, I ran water and no coffee to show the path is not interrupted through the handle.   If I use another brand of espresso that is not as finely ground I get a better flow.  Is it possible the pump is not allowing enough pressure with either brand?    ILLY support is a joke.  In the video I did blow off the grounds to not impede the seal.

It’s meant for getting rid of the food that is made in large batches where you can’t always predict the exact amount of sales, but you want to have it fresh and ready when people come in. 

Obviously, that’s going to be donut shops and other bakeries and coffee shops, bagel, shops, and the type of pizza places that do a lot of sales by the slice in addition to whole pizzas.

Yes, I love finding other types of food on there and hot food or whole meals, etc. but it just makes sense that places that do almost entirely made to order are not going to have leftover at the end of lunch service or dinner service. 

So that’s mostly going to be buffets , and some types of cuisine that do lend themselves to making large batches at a time, like a Mexican restaurant that does their meals made to order, but they still know there’s going to be a lot of sides of rice and beans so there could be a really good chance of having a lot of leftover rice and beans at the end.

It’s not a discount meal app. That’s why it doesn’t have a lot of hot food on it from made-to-order only places.",68,1728341728.0,toogoodtogo,8,0.96,False
