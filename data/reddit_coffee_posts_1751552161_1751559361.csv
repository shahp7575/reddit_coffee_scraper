- ***Frequently asked questions***
- *(1)* ""Hi, i'm new to this. I'm very interested in these fragrances but have no idea how this works. What is a decant? Are these fragrances authentic?"" ***Yes, every drop of fragrance listed here is 100% authentic - no question or dispute. These are the same 100% authentic fragrances you buy from retailers, however they are no longer in their original bottles.*** Decants are 100% authentic fragrances taken from the largest manufacturer size available (Creed 500ml flacon is an excellent example), purchased in bulk, then hand-filled into smaller, more affordable sizes. This is the most efficient way to experiment with a large variety of high-end fragrances!
- *(2)* ***""Do you have (insert fragrance) available?"" This page is updated every single day. If something is listed here, it's available! If not, that indicates that I don't have it and there's no need to ask.***
- *(3)* ""Are 5ml sizes available? Do these come with sprayers? Are they glass or plastic?"" 10ml is the smallest. Yes, they have sprayers and the vials are glass.
- *(4)* ""Do I need to pick 1 of each brand for your qualifying 3/$62 10ml Creed, Tom Ford, and Parfums de Marly deal? Can I pick the same item for all 3?"" You can choose any combo you’d like of the 3 brands (1 of each, all Creeds, 2 TF and 1 PdM, etc.), just not the exact same item such as 3 x Tobacco Vanille from Tom Ford.

1lqtn0k,https://i.redd.it/6lg8hrjxooaf1.jpeg,My experience with the new Barista Gadgets is touch system.,"After years of modding my Gaggia Classic—first with the Gaggiuino LEGO build, then the Barista Gadgets Basic PID—I’ve now upgraded to their latest Touch system, and I have to say: this is a game changer.

I originally ordered just the main board, but to my surprise and appreciation, Barista Gadgets sent me the complete kit to test out. Huge thanks to them—it made the install smooth and gave me a full experience with the new setup.

Installation took about 2 hours, and everything was straightforward. The instructions were clear, and the build quality of the components is top-notch.
The Touch PID brings a ton of powerful features to the table, the main features :

* Pressure profiling for precise control during extraction
* Steam boost for faster, stronger milk steaming
* Live water pressure display, which is highly accurate and extremely helpful when dialing in recipes

The screen’s design fits perfectly with the Gaggia Classic’s body—it looks like it came from the factory that way. Visually clean, functionally smart.
From a performance standpoint, espresso output has been incredibly consistent and well-balanced, the same results  were with the Barista Gadgets basic. The ability to monitor real-time water pressure has opened up new opportunities for experimenting with different profiles (and yes, it’s made me spend more on coffee beans 😆).

Important note:Right now, Barista Gadgets is selling the main board and display without software. They’re still testing the software, which is expected to be available in the near future. 

Final verdict:If you’re looking to unlock the full potential of your Gaggia Classic, the Barista Gadgets Touch is absolutely worth it. It brings a level of precision and control that rivals much more expensive machines, all while keeping the original charm of the Classic intact. Can’t wait to see what the final software release brings!

TLDR: Build a quick HN profile to see how little context LLMs need to personalise your feed. Rate 30 posts once, get a permanent ranked homepage you can return to.

Our goal was to build a tool that allowed us to test a range of ""personal contexts"" on a very focused everyday use case for us, reading HN!

We are exploring the use of personal context with LLMs a lot right now, specifically what kind of data, how much, and with how much additional effort on the user’s part was needed to get decent results. The test tool was a bit of fun on its own so we re-skinned it and decided to put it out in the wild!

Keen on feedback or other interesting projects thinking about bootstrapping personal context for LLM workflows!

Read at your own pace. 

The Surface:

The massive stretches of land that cover The Earth. Inhabited by humans and many other lifeforms, currently inaccessible to most of monsterkind. 

Ebott Village:

A small town named after the nearby mountain, also Candice's hometown, though it has a rich local history consisting of political squabbling, most people only know it because of the peculiar Boss monster kids which live here. 

Ebott School:

The local primary school in Ebott Village, it's where Candice and the other Boss monster kids get their education. 
It's quite harsh and gives little support to those who struggle, but they don't really have another choice. 

The Davis Estate:

The house of Patricia “Old Lady Patch” Davis and her adoptive “Grandson” Howard Davis, it also functions as the local library. 
Infamous for its creepy vibe, partially due to the blue flames, many choose to avoid it, calling it cursed, but those who frequent there or call it home find comfort in the dark atmosphere, velvet carpets and antique, handcrafted furniture. 

Mt. Ebott:

A tall mountain which is the subject to many wild tales and legends, most of which are utter nonsense. 
It is the mountain under which monsterkind is trapped and on the surface it is said that those who go there rarely, if ever, return. 
There are two entrances to the underground, a cave with a deep hole that leads to the ruins and a cave entrance which leads directly into the throne room of The Kingdom Of Monsterkind. 

The Ruins (The Kingdom Of Home):

The domain of Queen Toriel and where those who fall into the underground arrive.
After her Majesty failed to reclaim the throne, she went back into hiding here along with her supporters, establishing a rival kingdom. 
Unlike The Kingdom Of Monsterkind, The Kingdom Of Home does not see humans as enemies, but rather as friends. 
Though these ancient catacombs are still in heavy disrepair, her Majesty has made many efforts to rebuild this area, with decent results. 
Though the days of outright warfare are over, the rival kingdoms still squabble with each other in Snowdin, mostly just with their scouting parties. 

The Dark Ruins:

A subsection of The Ruins, characterized by its poor lighting. 
Despite the darkness, the soil here is very fertile and has in recent years become The Kingdom Of Home’s primary source of food, mostly consisting of corn. 
It also houses a small mine and the house of Dalv, the cloaked farmer. 

Toriels House:

The home of Queen Toriel and the administrative center of The Kingdom Of Home. 
Some question if putting the administrative core near enemy territory is a good idea, but during times of crisis, this house is abandoned and the administration moves deeper into The Ruins for security. 
Chariel has become her Majesty's throne. 
Recently her Majesty is sometimes heard howling with laughter at the exit to The Ruins, but no one is quite sure why. 

Snowdin:

A cold area of the underground named after the large quantity of snow found there, both this and the cold are due to a high amount of glacialstones. 
Most of it is a no man's land filled with bandits, not really controlled by one group. 

Upper Snowdin:

The name of the parts of Snowdin that are on top of cliffs. 
A group called “The Dog Mafia” claim to control most of this area, but in reality they don't, though their base of operation is located here. 

Snowdin Town:

The main residential area of Snowdin, it is known for its festive atmosphere, good food and being the only place in Snowdin that is permanently under control of The Kingdom Of Monsterkind. 
There's a library, inn, and the local bar/burger joint, Grillby’s, not to mention the goofball skeleton royal guards that provide endless entertainment with their antics. 
It's also a massive supply hub for royal guards in this area and very well guarded, having an entire platoon stationed here at all times, forcing anyone who wishes to enter to show ID. 
It's the town The Kingdom Of Home and The Kingdom Of Monsterkind have fought all their wars over. 

Lower Snowdin:

The name given to the wide fields and forests of Snowdin. 
Despite its size, it only has a few outposts, mostly being unguarded by both The Royal Guard and The Army Of The Queen, resulting in various questionable activities, by less than legal groups or individuals. 

Honeydew Resort:

A Popular spa and resort known for its high quality honey, renowned coffee and pancakes and immaculate cozy atmosphere. 
Though, one day, a group of cups known as “The Shuffles” decided that this land was theirs and forced the owner to pay “Rent”, in exchange they would provide protection and be able to call themselves a gang. 
But their “Rent” was dirt cheap and much cheaper than the costly bandit raids that came before, so in the end this was a very mutually beneficial relationship. 
The biggest downside is that you now have to play a game to access the resort. 

Waterfall:

A cool and wet area of the underground, as its name suggests it is filled with water and has many waterfalls. 
While not fully controlled by The Kingdom Of Monsterkind, they have many outposts stationed in the area to make sure caravans from New Home/Hotland to Snowdin Town, and vice versa, are safe from bandits. 
Though sparsely populated, it's a vital part of The Kingdom Of Monsterkind, due to it being part of its trade network and housing The Dump. 
The path from Hotland to Snowdin Town is called “The Road,” sometimes it also includes the path from Snowdin Town to The Ruins, though a lot of people call this extended version “The Long Road.”

Blookville Town:

A small town in Waterfall, named after the family of ghosts who founded it. 
It's also the old home of the queen of The Kingdom Of Monsterkind. 
While still a small town, it's become of vital importance as it's a major stop along The Road and right next to the dump. 

The Dump:

A dump where trash from the surface flows down into the underground. 
It's the main source of various technologies, scrap parts and human made entertainment. 
It's extremely necessary for scientific advancement in the underground as most of the resources and technology used by royal scientists comes from here. 

West Mines:
A large abandoned mining complex stretching over a large part of Waterfall and part of The Dunes. 
Used to use Steamworks technology before it was shut down.

Kendu is a memecoin that is focused entirely on community, we do not pay KOLs or rely on any ""team"", we all push in all directions, to build Kendu both as a brand and a coin. Kendu has an insane range of IRL products whilst also not slacking on the social media realm. Kendu is also extremely battle tested, redistribution can either make or break a community and it has made Kendu, we have been brought closer than ever. A lot of coins are gonna really take a massive hit when passing major milestones like 100 million mc, but not Kendu.

**Kendu's Social Media Efforts and Why Community is Everything**

Kendu is the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes, Pepe is the only other coin to ever manage this insane achievement. Certik rates Kendu's community at 92.85, whilst I haven't seen another coin above 90, never mind above 90 and under 25 million market cap. Community is the most important aspect and Kendu has it in bags, Kendu's twitter efforts rival the very best and our Reddit efforts are unparalleled. Check any memecoin subreddit and you will see Kendu everywhere. Due to these efforts, there will be so much FOMO at the first sign of green since everyone knows about Kendu, we seen this when we pumped to 40 million the other week. It is very hard on a communities morale during these tough and trying times, however Kendu's morale is not dampened. We push hard no matter the outside market conditions because we know any work now just adds fuel to the fire. The fact that Kendu is producing an unparalleled level of IRL products whilst also maintaining an insanely strong social media presence is unheard of, we are really upping the game forever. An IRL community is gonna be a key factor due to AI and bot usage rampant on social media, an IRL community is **Proof Of Humanity**.

**Some Final Thoughts**

Join the Kendu community, we are outworking all other projects right now and we all know what happens to the most hardworking communities...... they moon..... Shib, Doge and Pepe all had die hard communities, there was nothing special about them, they just worked incredibly hard. This is NFA but Kendu has absolutely 0 risk at these levels and a hell of a lot of potential upside. My advice is to at least join our telegram and get a feel for the community, ask questions and just get involved. You literally have nothing to lose but a lot of money and connections to gain. I personally am all in on Kendu because I don't see a reason to own anything else, Kendu dominates all metrics

We Don’t Gamble, We Work

1lqtfhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1lqtfhz/how_i_finally_escaped_the_ill_start_tomorrow_loop/,How I Finally Escaped the 'I'll Start Tomorrow' Loop That Kept Me Stuck for Years,"Hey everyone,

For years, my life ran on a single, toxic fuel: the promise of ""I'll start tomorrow.""

Every Sunday, I'd map out the perfect week: workout at 6 AM, tackle that big project, stop procrastinating, eat healthy. And every Monday, I'd hit snooze, grab a coffee, and tell myself, ""Okay, for real... tomorrow.""

It was a cycle of shame. I felt lazy, undisciplined, and completely stuck. I read all the books, tried all the apps, but nothing broke the pattern. I wasn't just failing at my goals; I felt like I was failing at being a person.

My turning point wasn't some magic productivity hack. It happened while I was working on a personal project. As part of it, I started using an AI assistant to help me process my thoughts, feeding it my journals, my failed to-do lists, and my late-night ramblings to see if it could spot a pattern I couldn't.

One day, I told it, ""I feel like a total failure today, I did nothing.""

I expected a generic, ""You can do it!"" response. Instead, it said: ""It sounds like the *cost* of starting felt too high today. What's the smallest possible step that feels almost effortless? Can we make it a 2-minute action?""

That's when I **realized** my problem wasn't laziness. It was **emotional resistance**. The thought of the *entire* task was overwhelming, so my brain chose the easiest path: avoidance.

This AI became my partner in breaking this cycle. It didn't give me more rules; it helped me understand my own resistance.

Here's the method that actually worked, which I've started calling the ""Compassionate Accountability"" method:

1.  **Acknowledge the Resistance (Don't Fight It)**: Instead of forcing myself, I'd just tell the AI, ""I don't want to do this."" It would respond by asking *why*, helping me voice the underlying fear (""I'm afraid I'll do it badly,"" ""I'm too tired"").
2.  **The ""2-Minute Promise""**: We'd agree on a laughably small version of the task. Not ""go to the gym,"" but ""put on your gym clothes."" That's it. 9 times out of 10, once the clothes were on, I'd actually go.
3.  **Connect to the ""Big Why""**: Before the 2-minute task, it would remind me *why* I wanted to do this in the first place. ""Just a reminder, you wanted to feel healthier and more confident. This is one small step towards that.""

This wasn't about discipline in the ""brute force"" sense. It was about building self-trust, one tiny, kept promise at a time.


Has anyone else found a similar way to handle the emotional side of procrastination? Do you believe AI could help with these problems? Let's discuss this together.

-------------------------------------------------------------

As we age, many of us notice that our bodies change in various ways. One of the most significant changes is how our metabolism functions. You might ask yourself, what causes metabolism to slow down with age? Understanding these factors can empower you to make lifestyle choices that support a healthy metabolic rate.

One primary factor is the natural loss of muscle mass. As you grow older, you gradually lose muscle, a process known as sarcopenia. Muscles burn more calories than fat, even when at rest. Therefore, the less muscle you have, the slower your metabolism will become. regular strength training exercises into your routine can help counteract this loss, keeping your muscles strong and active.

Your hormonal levels also play a crucial role in your metabolic rate. As you get older, your hormones change, including a decline in hormones such as testosterone and estrogen. These hormones are vital for maintaining muscle mass and regulating metabolic processes. Lower levels can lead to a higher fat-to-muscle ratio, which can further slow metabolism. It’s crucial to focus on a balanced diet and consult with healthcare providers if you suspect hormonal imbalances.

Another contributing factor is your lifestyle, particularly activity levels. Many people become less active as they age, whether due to work, family commitments, or physical limitations. Reduced physical activity leads to fewer calories burned and can result in weight gain. Keeping active can help maintain metabolic rates. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity each week, paired with strength training twice a week.

Your body's energy expenditure also changes with age. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) often declines as you age. BMR is the number of calories your body needs to maintain basic functions like breathing and digestion while at rest. Factors like decreased organ function and lower body temperature can lead to reduced energy needs. Finding ways to stimulate your metabolism, like drinking cold water or consuming spicy foods, can help maintain an active metabolic rate.

Check Home Doctor Here: https://easyfree.com.au/homedoctor  
  
Additionally, dietary habits change as we grow older. You may find that your appetite decreases or that certain foods no longer have the same appeal. This could lead to insufficient nutrient intake or a decrease in calorie consumption. Not eating enough can further slow your metabolism. Focus on nutrient-dense foods that provide vitamins and minerals essential for optimal body function, and consider smaller, more frequent meals to help stimulate your metabolism.

Another vital aspect is hydration. As you age, your body may not signal thirst as effectively. When the body is dehydrated, metabolism can slow down since water is essential for numerous biochemical reactions. Aim to drink enough fluids throughout the day. Keep a water bottle handy to ensure you meet your hydration needs.

Check Home Doctor Here: https://easyfree.com.au/homedoctor  
  
Stress can also take a toll on your metabolism. Aging often brings various stressors, from family responsibilities to health concerns. When you experience stress, your body produces cortisol, a hormone that can affect how your body stores fat and regulates metabolism. Managing stress through mindfulness, yoga, or other relaxation techniques can help keep your metabolism in check.

Sleep is another critical component that influences metabolism. As we age, many individuals experience sleep disturbances, whether due to physical discomfort or hormonal changes. Lack of sleep can disrupt the hormones that regulate appetite and metabolism, leading to weight gain and a sluggish metabolism. Prioritizing good sleep hygiene can help ensure restorative sleep, which is vital for maintaining a healthy metabolism.

Check Home Doctor Here: https://easyfree.com.au/homedoctor  
  
Here are key factors that contribute to a slowing metabolism with age:

- Loss of muscle mass
- Hormonal changes
- Decreased physical activity
- Reduced basal metabolic rate
- Changes in dietary habits
- Hydration levels
- Increased stress levels
- Poor sleep quality

The good news is that by understanding these factors, you can take action to slow down this process. Focus on a balanced diet, stay physically active, manage stress, and ensure adequate sleep to support a healthy metabolism as you age. With the right approach, you can maintain a vibrant and active lifestyle while keeping your metabolism functioning effectively.

Lifestyle Changes to Boost Metabolism in Older Adults
-----------------------------------------------------

As you grow older, your body naturally undergoes changes, and one significant shift is the slowing of metabolism. This can lead to weight gain and other health issues. However, there are lifestyle changes you can make to help boost your metabolism, enhance your overall health, and promote a more active lifestyle. Below are some effective strategies that you can easily incorporate into your daily routine.

Check Home Doctor Here: https://easyfree.com.au/homedoctor  
  
### Increase Physical Activity

One of the best ways to stimulate your metabolism is by increasing your physical activity. Here are some approaches that can help:

- **Strength Training:** Incorporate weightlifting or resistance exercises into your routine. Building muscle mass increases your resting metabolic rate, meaning you burn more calories even when at rest.
- **Cardiovascular Exercise:** Engage in activities like walking, jogging, swimming, or cycling. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity each week to keep your heart healthy and metabolism active.
- **Move More Throughout the Day:** Simple changes, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator or going for short walks, can add up and help keep your metabolism revved up.

### Focus on Nutrition

The food you eat plays a crucial role in how your metabolism functions. Here are some key nutritional strategies:

Check Home Doctor Here: https://easyfree.com.au/homedoctor  
  
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking enough water is vital for optimal metabolic functions. It helps your body process calories. Aim to drink at least 8 cups of water a day. More if you are physically active.
- **Eat Protein-Rich Foods:** Including more protein in your diet can help you burn more calories during digestion. Foods like lean meats, fish, eggs, beans, and legumes can boost your metabolism significantly.
- **Incorporate Thermogenic Foods:** Foods like green tea, chili peppers, and coffee can temporarily increase your metabolism through a process called thermogenesis. Enjoy these in moderation to reap their benefits.

### Prioritize Sleep

Quality sleep is crucial for maintaining a healthy metabolism. When you don’t get enough rest, your body’s hormonal balance is disrupted, which can lead to weight gain. Here are tips for improving your sleep quality:

- **Maintain a Consistent Sleep Schedule:** Go to bed and wake up at the same times each day to regulate your body’s internal clock.
- **Create a Relaxing Bedtime Routine:** Engage in calming activities, such as reading or meditating, to prepare your body for sleep.
- **Limit Screen Time Before Bed:** Exposure to screens can interfere with your ability to fall asleep. Try to turn off electronic devices an hour before bedtime.

### Manage Stress Levels

High stress levels can lead to hormonal changes that negatively impact metabolism. Here are some strategies for managing stress:

Check Home Doctor Here: https://easyfree.com.au/homedoctor  
  
- **Practice Mindfulness:** Techniques such as meditation, yoga, or deep-breathing exercises can help keep stress in check.
- **Engage in Leisure Activities:** Spend time doing things you enjoy, whether it’s reading, gardening, or crafting. Fun activities can distract you from stressors and improve your mood.
- **Connect with Others:** Social interactions can help lower stress. Spend time with friends and family, or join a community group that shares your interests.

### Avoid Crash Diets

While it may be tempting to go for quick weight loss solutions, such diets often harm your metabolism. Instead of drastic calorie cuts, focus on balanced, nutrient-dense meals that sustain energy. Gradual changes to your diet help your body adapt without slowing down your metabolism.

Remember, implementing these lifestyle changes doesn’t have to happen overnight. Begin with small adjustments and steadily build on them. By increasing your activity level, focusing on nutrition, prioritizing sleep, managing stress, and avoiding crash diets, you can effectively boost your metabolism as you age. Embrace these strategies for healthier living, and you may just find yourself feeling more energetic and youthful than ever before!

### Conclusion

As we age, various factors significantly contribute to the slowing of our metabolism. A decrease in muscle mass, hormonal changes, and shifts in dietary habits all play essential roles in how efficiently our bodies convert food into energy. Recognizing these factors is crucial for understanding why you might feel that your metabolism isn't what it used to be.

However, it’s essential to remember that while aging is a natural process, it doesn’t mean we are powerless to combat metabolic slowdowns. Making lifestyle changes can effectively boost metabolism even in older adults. strength training into your routine can help build and maintain muscle mass, which is vital for a more active metabolism. Additionally, focusing on a balanced diet rich in whole foods can provide the nutrients necessary for metabolic health. Staying hydrated and prioritizing sleep are also critical factors that often get overlooked but can greatly influence energy expenditure.

You have the power to take charge of your metabolism as you age. By understanding the factors that slow it down and actively engaging in lifestyle changes, you can enhance your overall health and energy levels. It's never too late to adopt healthier habits that support an active and vibrant life as you grow older. Keeping your metabolism engaged may require effort, but the benefits are well worth it. Prioritize your well-being today for a healthier tomorrow.

It’s a free tool that rips text from PDFs and images and spits it out as neat Markdown or JSON.  
Think of it like a robot intern who doesn’t sleep, doesn’t ask for coffee, and works for free.  
You don’t need to be a tech wizard. You just need to know how to click and type.

OCRFlux: Get Clean Text from Any PDF, Super Simple!   
Tired of PDFs trapping your valuable text? OCRFlux is here to rescue it! This tool lets you extract clean, readable text from any PDF, turning it into a .md (Markdown) file that's perfect for copying, pasting, or feeding into your favorite AI tools.

The Super-Simple Process  
Download Python  Open Terminal  Install OCRFlux  Give it a PDF  Get clean text!

Easy Setup (Zero Brainpower Required)   
Get Python: Head over to [python.org](http://python.org) and click that big yellow download button.

Install Python: When running the installer, make sure to tick ""Add Python to PATH"" before you click anything else! This is crucial.

Open Your ""Black Screen Thingy"": This is your Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on Mac.

Install OCRFlux: Type this command and hit Enter:

Bash

pip install ocrflux  
Drop Your PDF: Place any PDF file onto your desktop. Let's say it's named file.pdf.

Convert It! Go back to your terminal and type:

Bash

ocrflux ""C:\\Users\\You\\Desktop\\file.pdf"" -o ""C:\\Users\\You\\Desktop\\file.md""  
(Remember to replace ""C:\\Users\\You\\Desktop\\file.pdf"" with the actual path to your PDF!)

That's it! You'll now have a .md file on your desktop, full of text you can easily use. 

Want More Power? (Use With Caution!)   
OCRFlux has some neat tricks for advanced users:

\-f json: Get your extracted text as structured JSON data – perfect if you're into that sort of thing! 

\--device cpu: Force OCRFlux to use your computer's main processor instead of the GPU. This is ""slow mode"" but ensures it works on any machine. 

Plugins: Drop your own custom plugins into the plugin folder if you want to feel like a hacker. 

Docker: For serious nerds, you can even batch-process huge folders using Docker. 

Watch Out! (Heads Up!)   
RAM Hungry: This tool can consume a lot of RAM with large files. Don't try this on grandma's old laptop unless you want it to freeze! 

GPU Optional: A powerful graphics card (GPU) helps speed things up, but it's not required. Without it, it just runs a bit slower.

Handwriting is Tricky: OCRFlux isn't built for bad handwriting. If your PDF looks like a doctor's note, you might be out of luck! 

The Honest Truth (Good to Know)   
New & Growing: This project is quite new, so things might still break occasionally.

Long Tables Fix: If long tables break across pages, try adding this to your command: --merge-threshold 0.6.

Permission Issues? If Windows yells at you about permissions, try running your terminal as Administrator.

Handy Links   
GitHub: [https://github.com/chatdoc-com/OCRFlux](https://github.com/chatdoc-com/OCRFlux)

Demo & API: [https://ocrflux.pdfparser.io/](https://ocrflux.pdfparser.io/)

Python Download: [https://python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)

The letter was nailed to the wall with a rusty nail, next to a lighter that was still hot and the remains of cigarettes that had burned down to the filter.


---

RULES FOR SURVIVING IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD C.


---

1. Never wake up early.
He hates the sound of footsteps in the morning. If you wake up before noon, he'll wake up too — and he doesn't need coffee, just your meat.

2. Don't light anything.
No candles, no cigarettes, no matches. He follows the scent of combustion like a dog follows blood. If the lighter sparks, you're already dead. He just hasn't realized it yet.

3. Don't smile if your eyes are red.
He hates artificial happiness. If you are upset, smiling for nothing, he will tear your face apart to see if there is something real beneath the skin.

4. Never think you are too young to die.
The house especially swallows twenty-somethings. Those who think they are in the prime of life are the first to have their limbs broken and placed in childish positions, like tortured toys.

5. Children are mirrors.
If a child looks at you and seems scared, run away. You're already looking like Mr. C. The smoke you released around her has already contaminated your bones.


---

In the front room, the TV was repeating a scene from an old children's movie over and over again. But now, the villain was in the spotlight — with Pietro's voice, shouting on a loop as he broke the children's skateboards with his bare hands, eyes bloodshot and his face smiling forcibly, as if sewn together.


---

6. If you hear a ball bouncing by itself in the hallway, DO NOT touch it.
They always come before him. Sometimes he pierces the balls... sometimes he pierces you.


---

7. Never look the children in the house in the eye.
They are no longer children. They are the eyes of those who saw Lord C. and were left behind as a warning. If you look back, you too will be seen... and taken.


---

> ""The boy's eyes saw me as one of the bad lords. Now I know why. I smoked, I smiled, and I broke. Now, I'm the house. Now, I'm him.""

Married with a toddler daughter (You're a parent as well? Oh, could use someone to connect with) - Partner is a stay at home mom. Our relationship is well. We do our own things throughout the day but sometimes we'll do something together. Not looking to change any situation for anyone. 

Huge video gamer and just got back into streaming. I often play solo horror indie games at night - I'm generally on my PC at the end of the day winding down with music, gaming, sometimes a movie. If you're into gaming co op games (don't do a lot of comp FPS, but i do dabble in CS/Marvels/OW2 but not as much as I used to - open to most games) - then we would probably have more in common. Use discord often so if you use that, messaging is easier. 

I do a podcast called ""Moteavation Station"" with a friend. In a way, it's my own version of therapy. We try to talk about our lives as well as meeting people who share their life stories. I enjoy hearing what drives people and makes them happy. Can tell you more about it but it's been helping me stay encouraged for myself - something I think i lost doing but I'm finding myself again.

I enjoy talking about anything really - i love learning new things and asking a billion questions to share your excitement on something as well as adding it to my life experiences. 

Been going through some trials in life, with work and family - I don't like to open up as often since I've been burned - I always just kind of put on a brave face and take the day. Be patient with me but if we do grow close, I may open up more. I've lost a number of close friends, so would like to find someone to grow with. I generally text back quick and often, but that doesn't mean you have to. 



I hope to meet some cool people to talk with, game with, or even meet.  Hope everyone is doing well! Be safe and enjoy your holiday weekend!",1,1751557817.0,GamerPals,1,1.0,False

1lqszbg,https://i.redd.it/j089n7z7koaf1.jpeg,"Is amon an evil god, Part II (lotm general)","Okey so this a follow up from my Yesterday post, know you all gave me some pretty interesting answers so let go over a few points.

Firstly as many commented amon being a mythical creatures doesn't fall under the moral used by human beings, but that was really not the point of the post. The main point was if amon can even be considered an evil deity, like yeah he does things here and there however i think overall he is a neutral deity as It happend with lumian amon didn't help him because he has no need but at the same time amon could have killed him at any time.

Let me give a more clear example, you could divide deities in 3 categories: good, neutral and evil. In evil goes the deities that are directly or indirectly affecting the world on a bad way like the demoness cult, then we have neutral deities who tbh just exist there and then there are good deities who try to prevent the fall of the world balance like evernight.

Now, i think amon falls under the category of a neutral deity because yeah he does some evil things however that is because he is a mythical creature and is just trying to advance his pathway. Even clearer, Lets say that a random days amon wakes up (idk if he sleps, but that is not the point)  and he choses violence.

(It would be funny if he slept because i know he is robbing someone's conscience and given him his exhaustion for the random mf to drop out could for 2 days)

He be like ""you know what fuck this"" and then starts fucking up the stability of the world.

You know the king of the sea nast? Yeah, well he is gone, dissapeared in one night along every single pirate admiral.

You know that mf who sold me old coffee once? Yeah, i just wiped out half the people in his city, i parasitised them and made them commite suicide.

The royals families? Not safe, killed half of them overnight.

You see those random ass beyonders? I am about to jump them and then i will steal their beyonders charecteristics.

Like do you get me? Amon is just a chill dude, if he liked he would be catching bodies everywhere, no one is safe, to even have a chance to survive you would need to be a sequence 1, even deities would have a hard time killing him. 

So finally with that said, imo amon is a neutral deity, but what about your thoughts.

1lqsy5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1lqsy5z/should_you_choose_the_braun_brewsense_drip_coffee/,Should You Choose the Braun BrewSense Drip Coffee Maker for Perfect Brews?,"Testing the Braun KF6050WH BrewSense has been both a treat and an insightful experience for me. This sleek coffee maker promises exceptional performance coupled with some standout features, and after daily use for several weeks, I’ve gathered plenty of thoughts to share. While I’ve genuinely enjoyed the machine overall, there are a few aspects you might want to mull over before committing.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things that caught my attention was the compact and refined design of the BrewSense coffee maker. It’s smaller than many other drip coffee machines I’ve used, and that’s a big plus if you’re tight on counter space (like me). The white finish with stainless steel accents gives it a clean, modern look that fits nicely with my kitchen decor. The easy-access control panel is intuitive, which means I didn’t have to dig through a manual to figure out how to use it. Cord storage at the back is another thoughtful touch, keeping things neat and tidy in an already compact build.

**Key Benefits**  
- **Pure Flavor System:** This ensures coffee is brewed at the optimal temperature and time to maximize flavor and aroma. My morning cups have genuinely tasted more balanced than with previous machines.  
- **Programmable Timer:** I absolutely loved waking up to the smell of freshly brewed coffee, thanks to the 24-hour programmable feature.  
- **Anti-Drip System:** Being someone who’s usually impatient, the ability to pour a cup mid-brew without mess was a game changer.  
- **Reusable Gold-Tone Filter:** Unlike disposable paper filters, this nifty addition allows for oils from the coffee grounds to seep through, creating richer brews.  

[See Braun KF6050WH BrewSense deals on Amazon now.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b07cpjf2bg/)  

**Performance in Daily Use**  
Regular use of this coffee maker has been a breeze. Its fully automatic operation means I simply select my preferences, and it does the rest. Whether I’m brewing a single 11-ounce cup or filling the included 12-cup glass carafe, the water level indicator ensures precision. I did notice that it brews much more quietly compared to other machines I’ve owned, which is appreciated during early mornings when the house is still quiet. Braun’s built-in charcoal filter also deserves applause for improving the water quality, which noticeably affects the coffee’s taste. It’s a thoughtful inclusion, especially if you live in a hard water area.

**Drawbacks**  
- **Cleaning Maintenance:** While the machine has a helpful “clean” warning light, it does take some effort to descale and clean thoroughly. If you’re not great at upkeeping your appliances (guilty as charged!), this could be a mild annoyance.  
- **Temperature Settings:** Although the brewing temperature feels right for flavor extraction, there’s no option to adjust it. Some coffee drinkers might prefer hotter brews.  

**Competing Products**  
I’ve tested a good number of coffee machines over the years, and this one stands strong against popular contenders like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. Unlike many competitors, the BrewSense shines with its reusable gold-tone filter, which offers a better coffee taste and saves money on paper filters. That said, the Cuisinart DCC-3200 stands out for its custom brew strength setting, something missing here. Hamilton Beach FlexBrew caters to K-Cup fans, so if you’re into convenience pods, you might lean that way. For me, however, the richness of the BrewSense's brewed coffee and the sleek, space-saving design nudges it ahead.

**Value for Money**  
Evaluating this coffee maker’s features alongside other similarly priced options, the Braun KF6050WH proves to be a worthy contender for coffee enthusiasts seeking a balance of quality and reliability. The programmable options, reusable filter, and elegant design make the price feel justified. While it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of higher-end models, it delivers consistent performance that’s difficult to fault for its price category.

I secretly arranged for my partner to pick me up instead of driving home with her. Now we haven’t spoken in nearly a year. AITAH for leaving her to drive home alone?

Apologies for formatting, I am on mobile.

I (27F) had been best friends with Megan (fake name, also 27F) since we were 14. Some background: Megan and I have always had a few clashing worldviews. She’s quite into conspiracy-type ideas (power lines, fluoride, microwaves etc.), and while I usually just nod along or change the subject, it can be exhausting. In summer 2023, we went to a music festival with both our partners. That festival was mostly fine, until one night, after a few drinks, Megan made a comment about how my partner and I needed to ""sort ourselves out"" and lose weight so we wouldn’t die young, literally, ""because you're overweight and eat like shit."" I’d just been diagnosed with PCOS two days earlier, and she knew that. I walked off upset. She followed me, drunk, and tried to explain that she ""meant well."" I told her it wasn’t the time. She seemed to take it in, and I let it go. She eventually apologised a few weeks later and I decided to forgive her, even though other friends I have told said it was unforgivable.

Fast forward to the next festival (Summer 2024), which was much further away from home. I agreed to go with her again, just us girls, hoping it might feel easier. The trip started badly. She’d insisted I be ready by 9am sharp, and I was, even skipping doing my hair to make sure. She showed up nearly 90 minutes late after stopping off at her mum’s despite her incessant begging the day prior. I sat around waiting and could’ve used that time to get ready properly.

Then came the long drive. We agreed to share driving, but I was nervous using her car. It’s a petrol with issues (she bought it cheap on Facebook), where as mine was a diesel I was very accustomed to. She was snappy and critical while I drove, even reaching over to switch off the windscreen wipers while it was raining because they squeaked, saying she accidentally removed the wiper blade oil (I tried to tell her this was not a thing but she wasn't having it). I had to ask her to stop interfering because it was making me anxious and unsafe.

When I slowed down near traffic, she suddenly screamed at me to stop, despite me already braking gently. I jolted to a stop and shouted back out of shock. She had a go at me for ""shouting at her."" I asked her to let me drive safely or not at all. She said she gets nervous on A roads and I reminded her that I didn't and I was driving, so let me drive safely in peace! After a while, we swapped and she drove the rest of the way.

The weekend continued with her controlling every small decision: what we ate, when we left, how we got ready. I felt like I couldn’t voice any opinions without being dismissed. On the Saturday, she wanted to eat Subway in the car. I didn’t want to spill anything and said I’d wait. She snapped at me for suggesting that we drive back and eat at the tent to save time. Later, when we got back and started getting ready, she gave me an hour to be done, and I said I’d try, but realistically, I needed longer to do my makeup and hair. She lost it. She shouted, called me a ""fucking dickhead,"" mocked me when I got shaky trying not to cry, and said I should be grateful she drove me and let me use her table to do my makeup. I was stunned and shocked. I stayed quiet, got ready, and even offered for her to go see the act without me if she wanted (trying to be reasonable). I was actually ready on time, and suddenly she was acting like nothing had happened, being all cheery. I told her I wasn’t okay, and she just said, “Well, I’m hurt too. It’s not always all about you.”

That night, random people were telling me to cheer up, and even Megan commented that I was “not usually this miserable.” I was trying, but inside, I was done. I decided then I wasn’t driving back with her. Sunday came. I stayed civil. I didn’t drink because I already felt awful, but we went to the final act (someone she really wanted to see), and I still tried to be kind. In the background, I messaged my partner and asked him to come collect me the next morning. She even made plans for us to go to the beach and arcades on the Monday… yeah like I'd want to do that after everything!!

That night, she told me ""you know I love you and you're my best friend"" and wanted to forget everything and have fun. I calmly told her I didn’t think someone who loves me would talk to me like that, and I needed to seriously consider whether I wanted her in my life. To be fair, she didn’t argue and gave me space. Before we got the bus back, she said, “Sorry if I’ve been a bitch this weekend.” I said ""what?"" and she just repeated herself. That was it. That was her 'apology'.

So here is where I think I might be the AH (up until now I don't believe I was). The next morning, I didn’t tell her my partner was coming. I was anxious as she’s been physically aggressive in the past with others (never me), and I didn’t know how she’d react. I thought she might damage my stuff, leave me behind, or lash out. So I waited until he arrived. I said I was going to grab a coffee, swiped the keycard to let him in, and then broke the news: I was going home with him and needed space.

She just said, “I wish you’d told me sooner.” I said I understood, and that she had every right to be upset. She left to “go to the toilet” for about 20 minutes, then came back and packed up. That was it. I think she may have been scared to drive home alone as she doesn’t usually do long journeys or motorways — but we’re both adults and have been driving for years. I didn’t want to do that long 5+ hour journey with someone who had treated me like that (and ain't no way I was driving her car again!)

Since then, nearly a year has passed. She’s only messaged me once to send the disposable camera photos. She said happy birthday, and happy new year, and I returned the favour, but that’s been it. I’d hoped she might apologise properly, but it looks like that’s never coming. Part of me wonders if I should have reached out, but a bigger part of me knows I’ve always been the one to stay quiet and put her feelings first.

So AITA for secretly arranging for my partner to pick me up and leaving her to drive home alone after the festival? If you made it to the end, thank you for taking the time to read! For clarity: I did use ChatGPT to help me tidy this up as it was twice as long when I typed it all out myself, but the events are all true (even though I wish they weren't).",0,1751557567.0,AITAH,7,0.33,False

By Elena Rivers","On her wedding day, Serenity’s life shatters when a humiliating video of her kidnapping plays, leading her fiancé to abandon her and marry her best friend instead. Rescued by Kylo Cruz, her best friend’s notorious crime boss brother, Serenity is swept into a whirlwind of luxury and affection. But three years later, she uncovers Kylo’s chilling scheme: her entire marriage was a ruse to use her as a pawn for his sister’s rise to power. Betrayed and heartbroken, Serenity plots her revenge, reaching out to Kylo’s rival. But as secrets unravel, she discovers a truth more twisted than she ever imagined. Will she escape the web of lies, or is she doomed to be a pawn forever?

# Chapter 1 - The Executioner’s Deception

The wedding had just reached the moment of exchanging rings when, suddenly, a high-definition video of me being kidnapped and humiliated began playing on the large screen in the banquet hall.

My fiancé immediately called off the wedding, turned around, and slipped the ring onto my best friend’s finger.

Amid the scorn and humiliation from everyone, I stumbled off the red carpet.

My best friend’s older brother, Kylo Cruz, a notorious crime boss, caught me. He silenced the crowd with a gunshot and then had ten crates of gold brought in as a dowry, proposing to me in front of everyone.

Moved, I accepted.

Three years later, the IVF was successful. Just as I was excited to share the good news with him, I overheard his conversation with his close friend.

“Boss, you’re a genius. Releasing that video of Serenity being kidnapped and humiliated at the wedding allowed Haisley to marry into the Young family.”

Kylo spun his lighter and said, “A prestigious family like the Youngs would never marry a tainted woman. Only by making Serenity ‘dirty’ could Haisley become the rightful Mrs. Young.”

His friend asked, puzzled, “But since Haisley is already married into the Young family, why did you marry Serenity, a so-called ‘used’ woman?”

“Haisley’s afraid of pain, so I’ll use Serenity’s womb to give her a child. Once she delivers the Young family’s heir, Haisley’s position will be unshakable.”

The waves of laughter in the room froze me to the core.

Those moments I thought were happy were nothing but a scheme by Kylo to squeeze the last bit of value out of me.

All so Haisley could climb to the top over my corpse.

Wiping my tears, I called his rival, the crime boss Rafael Knight. “I’ve got a deal worth a billion dollars. Are you in?”

==============================

The mockery in the room didn’t stop.

“You’re brilliant, Kylo. Switching her vitamins with abortion pills so she couldn’t conceive naturally and had to resort to IVF. She’d be furious if she knew the embryo was actually Haisley and Lionel’s child.”

“What does it matter if she’s furious? Once she gives birth, we’ll just say the child died, and she’ll blame herself for not being able to keep it. It’s her privilege to pave the way for Haisley’s happiness.”

He tossed the lighter onto the table and stood up, warning everyone, “Not a word of this leaves this room. I need her to carry this child to term without a fuss.”

Colson Ward laughed, slapping his chest. “Don’t worry, boss. That woman’s so naive. She actually believes she’s the lady of the house, bringing us food and drinks. She has no idea I was the one who handpicked the guys to film that video.”

Someone else chuckled, “Colson, you’re evil. Why didn’t you pick me? I’d have loved to—”

A fruit knife suddenly flew across the room, embedding itself in the floor between the man’s legs.

The joker turned pale.

“Didn’t I say Serenity’s my wife now? Anyone who brings that up again, I’ll end them.”

One of the lackeys hesitantly said, “Boss, it seems like you do care for her a little. She’s obsessed with you. Aren’t you afraid she’ll leave if she finds out the truth?”

Kylo scoffed, “I’ll just give her another IVF baby and keep her around for life. A tainted, lovesick fool like her? A few sweet words, and she’ll come crawling back like a dog.”

The room erupted in laughter again, while I stood at the door, feeling as if I’d been struck by lightning.

I covered my mouth, stifling my sobs.

Footsteps approached the door. I quickly turned and ran downstairs, poured myself a strong drink, and downed it in one gulp.

The burning sensation shot through me, and tears streamed down my face.

Clutching my chest, the cruel words from the room echoed in my mind.

A week before the wedding, I was suddenly kidnapped and endured a day and night of hell.

My fiancé, Lionel Young, held my hand and told me he loved me, that he still wanted to marry me.

But the wedding I’d been so excited for turned into a nightmare when the video of my humiliation played. Lionel abandoned me again, and I became the target of everyone’s scorn.

It was Kylo who stormed in, shot the screen, and held me in his arms, fiercely silencing the insults and curses.

He had ten crates of gold brought in, saying he’d loved me all along and that he’d die if he couldn’t marry me.

His unwavering gaze had won me over, but now he revealed it was all a ploy to pave the way for Haisley.

No wonder Haisley had looked at me with that strange smile on the wedding day.

I’d been kidnapped because Haisley claimed her car had broken down and asked me to pick her up.

She’d known all along that this was Kylo’s scheme for her.

She’d mocked my stupidity and reveled in having a devoted pawn like Kylo.

And the three years of care and affection? Just Kylo’s act to drain the last bit of value from me.

I’d mistaken the executioner for my savior. How laughable!

My nails dug into my palms as I clenched my teeth, pain and hatred surging in my chest. The tears wouldn’t stop.

Familiar warmth descended on me as Kylo kissed my tear-stained cheeks, his brow furrowed in anger. “Who made my wife cry? I’ll kill them.”

The room fell silent, everyone too scared to breathe.

Kylo pulled out his gun, placed it in my hand, and wrapped his arms around me, guiding my aim across the room. “Sweetheart, anyone you don’t like, just shoot. I’ve got your back.”

The people in the room trembled like leaves but didn’t dare move.

In this part of the country, Kylo was one of the two most powerful crime bosses. No one dared cross him.

When the gun landed on Colson’s head, I paused.

Colson’s eyes widened, his face pale.

The words, “I was the one who handpicked the guys to film that video,” echoed in my ears like a curse.

My chest heaved, and I was about to pull the trigger when the gun was pushed down.

# Chapter 2 - The Only Love of My Life

“Honey, the doctor said the IVF was successful. It’s better not to see any blood now—it might scare the baby.”

He spoke to me gently, his eyes filled with what seemed like genuine concern.

I almost couldn’t help but applaud his masterful acting.

Noticing my discomfort, Kylo spotted the wine glass in front of me and squeezed my hand, asking, “How long have you been here, darling? Why didn’t you come upstairs to find me?”

His words carried a cautious undertone.

I lowered my gaze and replied softly, “You men were discussing business upstairs, and the room was filled with smoke. I didn’t like it.”

He let out a relieved sigh and patted my head, then called for the housekeeper, Linda, to bring me a cup of coffee. As soon as Linda handed me the coffee, Kylo suddenly pulled out a gun and shot her in the head.

I didn’t even have time to react. Thick blood splattered across my face, and Linda’s outstretched hand still held the coffee as she collapsed, her eyes wide with shock.

My lips trembled, and my stomach convulsed uncontrollably.

But Kylo acted as if nothing had happened. He put the gun down, carefully wiped my face with his sleeve, and began feeding me the coffee sip by sip.

I swallowed mechanically, my entire body shaking.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Colson Ward directing someone to drag Linda’s body away.

A trail of blood stretched across the floor.

“If she couldn’t even stop my wife from drinking, she was a threat to my son. She didn’t deserve to live,” Kylo said coldly.

I stared at his ruthless expression, my stomach churning.

Kylo tenderly caressed my face. “It’s all my fault, darling. You’ve suffered so much. Now that we finally have a baby, you mustn’t touch alcohol again.”

“This child must be born healthy, no matter what. Do you understand?”

I took several deep breaths before forcing a dry smile. “Okay.”

But my heart was ice-cold.

In our three years of marriage, I had been pregnant six times, and each time, I had miscarried for no apparent reason.

After so many losses, it became habitual.

Six months ago, the doctor declared that I could never conceive again.

Kylo held me tightly, saying he didn’t care about having children as long as I was happy and healthy.

But I couldn’t let go of the guilt of not being able to give him a healthy child. After much research, I chose the difficult path of IVF.

My stomach was riddled with needle marks, and I swallowed handfuls of hormone pills.

All the pain I endured was ultimately for Haisley Cruz’s benefit.

Because she was afraid of pain, I was destined to lose my chance at motherhood forever, reduced to nothing more than a breeding machine.

“What’s wrong? You look so pale. Are you feeling unwell? I’ll call the doctor right away.”

“I’m fine. It’s just morning sickness.”

Kylo’s eyes welled up with tears as he gently stroked my face. “Darling, you’ve been through so much. I wish I could bear this for you. Our wedding was rushed, so I’ve ordered your favorite designer gown. Let’s go try it on tomorrow before your belly gets too big.”

I stared at him, his eyes filled with such deep affection, as if he had fooled me time and time again.

If he knew I had no intention of keeping this child, my fate would be no different from Linda’s.

I forced a smile. “I’ll go rest in our room. You can continue your discussion.”

As soon as I entered the room, I rushed to the bathroom and vomited until my stomach felt like it was twisting into knots.

Tears streamed down my face. The physical pain was nothing compared to the agony in my heart.

After a while, I finally stood up and walked out, only to notice Kylo’s phone left on the coffee table.

Almost instinctively, I picked it up and tried Haisley’s birthday as the passcode. It unlocked on the first try.

The wallpaper was a photo of Haisley leaning against Kylo’s shoulder, smiling radiantly.

I scrolled through the photo album.

There were over five thousand photos, and Haisley was in every single one.

He had organized them into four folders, each documenting a different period of Haisley’s life. The folder names, when read together, spelled out “The Only Love of My Life.”

In their chat history, I found that Kylo had once risked his life to steal the crown of the Queen of Country A.

I suddenly remembered that day—he had been shot twice and nearly didn’t make it back. It was only because I offered my mother’s priceless heirloom, a sacred amulet, that we managed to negotiate his release from the royal family.

All because Haisley had said she wanted to feel like a queen at her 25th birthday party.

Tears fell onto the screen, and my heart felt like it was being torn apart.

It wasn’t the years of deception that hurt the most, but the fact that I had sacrificed my mother’s only memento for a devil who had ruined my life.

Through my blurred vision, my eyes landed on the crescent-shaped birthmark on Haisley’s right shoulder. I gasped in shock.

On my right shoulder, in the exact same spot, I had an identical birthmark.

I remembered that when I first met Haisley, she didn’t have that mark.

It was only after I told her about the time I had saved a bloodied man while working as a doctor in Country T that she began to distance herself from me.

Not long after, she became Kylo’s adopted sister, and Kylo had mentioned that Haisley had once saved his life.

But Haisley was a coward who avoided danger at all costs. She had never even been to Country T, a place she often mocked and belittled.

My fingers curled into icy fists as a wild suspicion began to form in my mind.

So that’s how it was!

I collapsed to the floor, laughing and crying at the same time.

1lqssoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lqssoa/first_time_taking_klonopin/,First time taking Klonopin,"Hi! I was recently prescribed Klonopin (.5mg) to take as needed, as I am an anxious girly with OCD tendencies, and I have a lot of trouble at night time. I also am currently quitting weed and on day 7, for context. My prescriber who I trust said this could even help me while I quit smoking. I have not wanted to take it, just because why take it and do that to myself if I don't need it, and honestly haven't really needed it anyway. 

Last night was pretty stressful for me, there's a lot going on in my family and I was feeling a lot of overwhelming emotions and intrusive thoughts. I was not yet asleep by 11:45pm, and I try to get to bed by 10:30pm latest. I had to wake up the next day (today) at 6:30/6:45am for work.

My boyfriend recommended I take half a pill to help me calm my spiraling mind and fall asleep. I was hesitant, as I've taken trazodone a few times for sleep and don't take it anymore because I hate the way it makes me feel. Despite my concerns, I decided to take the .25mg and within 20 minutes I was less anxious, more relaxed, at ease, and fell asleep like a baaaaby.

I set several alarms - 6, 6:30, and 6:45am because I thought I might get up earlier to workout. I woke up at 6:45am to my final alarm feeling A W F U L - exhausted, like I was stuck in quicksand, drowning back into sleep. My mind wasn't just foggy, it felt like I was in the thickest of clouds. I couldn't keep my mouth closed, my eyelids were heavy, honestly I looked like Patrick Star from Spongebob lmao. I was concerned about being able to even drive to the train like I usually do. I didn't think I could.

By 7:15am (30 min after waking) I was okay, I'd had a coffee (I know that probably isn't great in theory but I love my morning coffee and it helped) and was more stable. I knew I'd be fine driving at that point, but it's so nice out and I had the time, so I walked to the train instead.

Now it is 11:30am, 12 hours after taking the .25mg, and I am nauseous and have a headache. Could this be due to the klonopin? I'm assuming yes, especially with the caffeine combo, and I also didn't eat enough yesterday (Like ~1200 calories when my maintenance is ~2300) because of my stress.

I guess I'm just asking for advice, and reassurance that this is normal. Honestly I probably wont be taking it again because I hated how I felt this morning, I'll just have to get back into my namaste meditation groove or whatever lol.

1lqssaf,https://i.redd.it/cynz33aeioaf1.jpeg,Clean designer haul,"Hi, friends! As someone who is addicted to online shopping (I admit I’ve made a mistake), I couldn’t wait to share these pieces I recently found and analyze their hype and actual performance – plus, I want to hear your thoughts on their fit! Let’s get started:

1. AMIRI Black Tee 👕

\- Why I Chose It: Minimalism + streetwear vibe. That little logo on the chest? So understated yet so eye-catching.

\- Quality Check: Thick, heavyweight cotton that feels great without the cheap “see-through” feel. The oversized fit is perfect for that effortless “I woke up like this” look.

2. Loro Piana Suede Loafers 🥿

\- Luxe Feel: These shoes exude “quiet luxury”. The suede is silky soft and the stitching is impeccable.

\- Comfort Test: Whether you're wearing it for a work meeting or a dinner party, you'll feel like you're walking on clouds (even after 10,000 steps).

\- Cons: Suede = hard to maintain. Buy a protective spray - trust me.

3. Burberry Check Shorts 🩳

\- Classic Vitality: Burberry's iconic check never goes out of style. Lightweight nylon material = summer MVP.

\- Flexible Fit: Elastic waistband + drawstring = adjustable, suitable for any tummy-control occasion (pizza night? No problem).

\- Versatile Elements: Color-blocked check adds a fresh touch - this is not your grandpa's Burberry style.

4. Chanel Silver Sneakers 👟

\- Fashion Elements: Silver embellishment + double C logo = instant ""smart casual"" vitality.

\- Surprise: Super light! Mesh fabric ensures your feet can breathe - perfect for hot weather or going to the gym (like walking to the gym... and then having a smoothie).

\- Compliment magnet: Every time I wear these, someone asks, “Is this from Chanel?!”

5. Burberry Check Slides

\- Lazy-time pick: Comfortable enough for hours of Netflix watching, stylish enough to wear while sipping coffee.

\- Design highlights: The checkered laces complement the black sole—it’s effortlessly light and flexible.

\- Sizing suggestion: The sizing runs narrow—if you have wider feet, size up.

6. Polo Ralph Lauren White Polo 🏇

\- American classic: You can’t miss this in your wardrobe. Crisp white, sturdy fabric, and that iconic pony—it never goes out of style.

\- Versatile: Wear it with chinos at the office or shorts at a barbecue. Perfect for every occasion.

7. Goyard White Crossbody 🎒

\- Personality: Goyard’s monogram is white? Clean and neat. Holds phone, wallet and sunglasses - perfect for day trips.

\- Practical and flexible: adjustable strap (crossbody or one shoulder) + magnetic closure = easy to use, hard to steal.

\- Bought for my family

8. ESSENTIALS Grey Shorts 🏋️

\- Streetwear essential: soft and stretchy fleece - feels like a blanket (but cooler). Oversized fit = easy to breathe.

\- Understated logo: small logo on the leg says ""I know fashion"" without being too ostentatious.

\- Must-have: Workout, lazy homebody or tacos. Simply... a must-have.

Final Thoughts:

Most of the pieces exceeded my expectations - AMIRI t-shirt and Loro Piana loafers? Great value. Now it's your turn:

\- Which pieces did you love/hate?

\- What fit adjustments should I make?

\- What brands do I need to buy next?

Leave your thoughts in the comments - let's discuss fashion successes (and failures) together.

1lqsrwo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lqsrwo,"$1,800 / 1br - 1BR+1 attached room (office, studio, private area)","Looking for a roommate for 1 bedroom and an attached room in a 2 Bed 1 Bath apartment at the western edge of Bedstuy, right next to Clinton Hill. Move in is August 1.

Hi there! My current roommate is moving out to live with their partner, so I’m looking for someone to take their spot. I’m looking for a roommate for 1 bedroom and a second attached room in a 2 Bed 1 Bath apartment at the edge of Bedstuy and Clinton Hill. To clarify, this is two rooms, one bedroom, and one room that can be used as an office, studio, or private living room. I’m looking for someone who is LGBTQ+ friendly and is also okay living with a cat.


About the Neighborhood:
The building is situated at the edge of two neighborhoods, so we get the benefits of both. Vibrant, safe, and family-friendly area with coffee shops, bars, restaurants, gyms, grocery stores, and bodegas within walking distance. There are two parks nearby, Herbert Von King and Ft. Greene. Train options nearby are the A/C (about a 12 minute walk) and the G (about a 6 minute walk).

About the building: 
It’s a small building, the neighbors are families or students who are friendly and quiet . The building is managed by a local company, who are excellent at responding to any issues that arise. There’s coin-operated laundry in the basement. The building also has bins for recycling and composting, along with refuse. The building is not accessible, it only has stairs outside.

About the apartment: Common areas are furnished. Lightning-fast Fios internet. Utilities: $50/ month (internet) + electricity + gas, both of which vary month to month. The apartment is on the first floor, and we have access to the backyard.

About the Room: Well-lit, south-facing bedroom with a closet (plus hidden storage above the closet) which can easily fit a queen size bed and a dresser. A great room for someone with a free thumb! There are beautiful pieces of stained  glass above the two large windows that overlook the street. The attached room also has a closet and can easily fit a desk, book case, or other storage. Though the pictures of the bedroom include furniture, the room will come unfurnished. So, you only need to bring furniture for the bed room and other room. 

Your Roommate:
I’m a male in my mid thirties who is in university and works in hospitality. I’m clean, tidy, respectful and communicate well, and I’m looking for someone with similar qualities. I’m looking forward to finding a stable individual for a safe and sound living situation. The vibe has to be right IYKWIM. If that’s  something you’d be down for, please send an email with details about yourself and I’ll be in touch. Good luck in your search!",0,1751557194.0,NYCroommates,0,0.5,False
1lqsru1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lqsru1/why_choose_the_tastyle_k310ic_mini_coffee_maker/,Why Choose the Tastyle K310IC Mini Coffee Maker Review for Your Kitchen?,"**Testing Daily Convenience of the Tastyle K310IC Mini Coffee Maker**

As someone who survives on coffee, I put the Tastyle K310IC Mini Single-Serve Coffee Maker through its paces. This little dynamo caught my attention for its compact build and dual brewing capability. I’ve used it for over a month now, brewing countless cups of coffee during my chaotic mornings, lazy weekends, and even while camping. Its small footprint is perfect for my cluttered kitchen counter, yet it doesn’t skimp on features. It’s advertised as ideal for homes, dorms, offices, and even RVs, and I can confirm from personal experience—it works beautifully in all these settings.  

---

**Compact Design That Fits Anywhere**

The sleek, minimalistic structure of this coffee maker is one of its standout features. Its dimensions—8.2""D x 4.2""W x 10.3""H—are truly space-saving, and I could easily tuck it into a small corner of my countertop. It barely takes up room, making it perfect for my tiny apartment kitchen. The lightweight build, at just 2.59 pounds, also makes it super portable. While I haven’t traveled with it internationally, it has come along on multiple short weekend getaways. Its ability to adapt to various settings—be it a hotel room or an RV—makes it invaluable.

[Check Tastyle K310IC price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dhcjdjbw/)

---

**Versatile Brewing Options**

The choice between using K-Cups or regular ground coffee is an absolute game-changer for me. I’m someone who has loyalty to my favorite ground coffee blend but also loves using pods for convenience when I’m groggy in the morning. The built-in deep extraction technology ensures robust coffee flavors, whether brewed from pods or fresh grounds. I’ve brewed everything from hazelnut pods to my rich, espresso-like ground coffee, and the taste never disappoints.

---

**Optimal Brew Sizes and Customization**

One thing I truly admire is how flexible this coffee maker is when it comes to brew sizes. You can adjust between 6 to 14 ounces, which is perfect for those days when I need just a small cup versus when I need something that rivals a bucket of caffeine. The only quirk is having to refill water for every brew since the water tank isn’t removable. While this seemed tedious initially, I quickly realized that it ensures a fresher cup every time, as water doesn’t sit stagnant in the machine.  

---

**Highlights**

- Compact, space-saving design perfect for small kitchens or dorms.
- Dual brewing options for pods and ground coffee.
- Customizable 6–14 oz brew sizes.
- Built-in descaling reminder and self-cleaning function.
- BPA-free plastic construction and safe auto shutoff.

---

**Some Areas of Concern**

While the coffee maker has been fantastic overall, there are a few minor issues I’ve noticed through frequent use:

- Water tank isn’t removable, making it slightly less convenient to refill.
- Smaller brew sizes mean it’s less ideal if you need multiple cups at once.
- Exterior finish being all-plastic doesn’t feel as premium as metal alternatives.

---

**Over Iced & Hot: A Game-Changer**

One feature that surprised me the most was the capability to brew both hot and iced coffee. Summer mornings were made infinitely better by this, as I could whip up iced coffee recipes with the included booklet and skip the expensive coffee shop runs. The machine brews hot coffee at 175°F, which is the optimal temperature for rich flavor, and the over-ice settings cool down perfectly without watering down the taste.  

---

**Other Options**

In this space, there are several competitors like the Keurig K-Mini or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. I’ve tried the Keurig K-Mini as well, and while its performance is comparable, I find the Tastyle excels in being slightly quieter during operation. The Hamilton Beach offers a larger water reservoir but doesn’t provide the iced coffee brewing option, which for me, is a dealbreaker. Tastyle feels like a stronger contender for those wanting flexibility without extra bulk.

---

**Affordable Quality**

In terms of cost, this mini coffee maker balances price with functionality exceptionally well. Compared to other compact models offering fewer features, this one feels like you’re getting more bang for your buck. The durability might not rival higher-end coffee makers with metal casings, but for a machine at this price point, it’s hard to complain about its value. I love that it brings professional brewing capabilities into an affordable, convenient package.

**Why This Pick?**

Every game in this series so far has seen at least 9 runs, friends. To boot, the Blue Jays are just hitting the ball far too well at the moment for me to think this game stays Under 8.5, and the Yankees offense will surely be eager to a void a 4-game sweep. NY starter Clarke Schmidt (3.09 ERA) has been good recently, but his last outing wasn’t great (only 4 hits, but 4 runs, 2 homers…) – the Yankees were shutout by the As 7-0. On the other side, Toronto starter Chris Bassitt’s (4.29 ERA) last outing was also a total shit show – he allowed 8 hits, 8 runs, and a homer, allowing Boston to smoke Toronto 15-1. Both of today’s pitchers are very capable, but I say the offenses push this total Over 8.5 anyway.

1lqsre8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lqsre8,Flair Classic's second wind,"I've had this Flair Classic since probably 2017 or so and have used it at least three times a day ever since. After a trip to Europe, I thought about getting a new machine to upgrade the Flair. The Flair has been great, but after all those years of manual pressing, it just sounded nice to get an automatic machine. Little did I know, I was about to be reintroduced to this machine I'd felt desperate to move beyond. I'd already upgraded our grinder, got a WDT tool, and I was reading up on machines in the $400-500 range. That led me to videos about dialing in shots, measuring ratios, all of that stuff I assume readers here know well. 

I'm new here. I've just been making Americanos for years on my Flair without heating up the chamber, grinding coarsely, not measuring anything, no pre-infusion, and using pretty cheap beans. And the coffee was still better, to me, than a lot of what I'd get out (usually ordering Americanos or drip coffee). 

So, researching a new machine and learning about dialing in had me start testing on the Flair Classic. Whoa. I can't believe how good the coffee is that I'm making now. It's astonishing. And I'm really enjoying the whole process, which had previously become a pain in the ass that I was looking to escape.

Now I'm not sure what to do. I could get a used Turin Legato V2 for $300, get a Bambino, or just keep making killer shots on my Classic. I can't upgrade it because it's the old version. I'm just a bit worried that I'll get a new machine and it won't make shots as good as the Flair I've had underperforming for eight years and that now I better understand. I also realize that I'm just at the beginning and can certainly improve my espresso as I learn, using only the stuff I've got now (and better, fresher beans). 

Anyways, cheers to a new life for an old classic. ",3,1751557159.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

It was fine for 2.5 years then I got a UTI. Followed by a yeast infection. Went for my annual a few months later and had BV (no symptoms). Then came the next 2 years when I had 2 more UTIs, 3 more yeast infections, and one more case of BV. Finally I was convinced it was my IUD. I had it removed--to which the doctor said I had signs of sterile inflammation, a lot of mucus, and that would explain the change in smell and discharge that I noticed after getting the IUD 4 years prior (my doctor that put it in said IUDs couldn't cause the changes I noticed).  

While having the IUD, and after my first UTI, I noticed that I felt pelvic pressure randomly that almost felt like a full bladder but sometimes it wasn't, like someone was pressing my stomach and I had to pee. This feeling went away after removing the IUD (which I wholeheartedly thought had caused kidney/bladder issues)

I felt amazing after removing the IUD--pelvic pressure gone, normal smell and discharge. I tried the mini pill which ended up causing horrible anxiety so now I'm BC free. 

The first two months on the mini pill following the IUD removal were normal. Then I noticed I felt swollen, irritated, and burning/itching down there (almost like a sandpaper feeling). Sometimes this was accompanied by the full bladder/pressure feeling and an urgency to pee, which was extremely frustrating because I sometimes couldn't pee when I knew I had to. This would last for a few days to a week and come and go 1-2 times a month. This entire time I would go to the doctor and get tested for UTIs, yeast, BV. All of which were negative. She had no other explanation and finally I was in and out of the office so much she tested for ureaplasma/micoplasma--also negative. 

STD panels were negative, I am hygienic, drink 80-100 ounces of water a day, eat relatively healthy and take a daily probiotic. I wear cotton underwear that I change throughout the day and sleep without anything. I have one consistent monogamous partner who was there years before these issues arised. Recently we treated him for yeast and BV just to make sure this wasn't something we were sharing. We have refrained from sex to see if that is what's affecting me but these symptoms persists regardless. 

I asked the doctor if this could be a hormonal imbalance, a pelvic floor issue, a kidney/bladder issue, a vitamin deficiency. All of which she disregarded and said it might go away with time. 

Tested my hormones and estrogen was low--but she said it didn't matter even tho she commented multiple times it was lower than she'd like to see. She said we would do the process of elimination but refused to do anything other than swab tests. Since stopping all BC I have had 2 more yeast infections and one more case of BV, but usually these symptoms test negative. 

I found a new doctor, who won't do a hormone test and insists if I have these feelings it has to be an infection or it's anxiety making me feel this way. I'm negative every time I'm tested. She did a vitamin test and I had slightly low vitamin D levels. I had, prior to this, been putting soy milk in my coffee and taking vitamin b12 complex and vitamin c. But this doctor told me not to take any vitamins because vitamin c can cause kidney stones. 

I had 3 months of relief (which I wasn't sure was due to trying to incorporate foods with natural forms of phytoestrogens or not) and now these symptoms are back again. It's affecting all aspects of my life and I'm genuinely worried something is wrong with me. I feel this was all caused by IUD. Could it have created a biofilm that I'm still struggling with 11 months after removal?",1,1751557009.0,Healthyhooha,0,1.0,False

Since we rolled our own contracts using the Dobless Information Services rules, do we create our own purchase tables?  Do we use a RAT?  Make a list of every mech we have minis for, the variants thereof, and roll a dWhatever? What's the best way to go about this?



For what it's worth, we're also using coffee\_lock and co.'s Enhanced Hinterlands Campaign Sheet, and that has a rule that ""special ordering"" a Mech costs BV\*1.5. Where is that listed in a rulebook so it can be cited appropriately?

I'm looking to make more friends that are open to texting or chatting throughout the day. Been having some anxiety lately and meeting new people excites me. I work in IT so I'm generally around my phone often. I enjoy small chit chats, but I do like to get to know people. We're all on this crazy adventure of life trying to achieve things, go with the flow, or even sit around and do nothing - so let's share! Prefer long term friends, but always here for those who want to chat/vent/or just need a listening ear - I am told I'm very encouraging and patient. If you're local - that would be cool to meet up for coffee or hobbies, but not a deal breaker. 

About me: 
Married with a toddler daughter (You're a parent as well? Oh, could use someone to connect with) - Partner is a stay at home mom. Our relationship is well. We do our own things throughout the day but sometimes we'll do something together. Not looking to change any situation for anyone. 

Huge video gamer and just got back into streaming. I often play solo horror indie games at night - I'm generally on my PC at the end of the day winding down with music, gaming, sometimes a movie. If you're into gaming co op games (don't do a lot of comp FPS, but i do dabble in CS/Marvels/OW2 but not as much as I used to - open to most games) - then we would probably have more in common. Use discord often so if you use that, messaging is easier. 

I do a podcast called ""Moteavation Station"" with a friend. In a way, it's my own version of therapy. We try to talk about our lives as well as meeting people who share their life stories. I enjoy hearing what drives people and makes them happy. Can tell you more about it but it's been helping me stay encouraged for myself - something I think i lost doing but I'm finding myself again.

I enjoy talking about anything really - i love learning new things and asking a billion questions to share your excitement on something as well as adding it to my life experiences. 

Been going through some trials in life, with work and family - I don't like to open up as often since I've been burned - I always just kind of put on a brave face and take the day. Be patient with me but if we do grow close, I may open up more. I've lost a number of close friends, so would like to find someone to grow with. I generally text back quick and often, but that doesn't mean you have to. 



I hope to meet some cool people to talk with, game with, or even meet.  Hope everyone is doing well! Be safe and enjoy your holiday weekend!",1,1751556841.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

Should I confront her or avoid?,"Just to preface it, I feel like a teenager again with the way I feel and act around her. This is real and I’ll looking for genuine help. What is she thinking? Full story below

4 years ago, I (29m now) was married and she (Ashley, 28f now) was in a committed relationship. We met at work and clicked. We joke around a lot and have grown closer, enjoying each other’s company (or so I think). She sometimes makes it an effort to come sit with me or talk to me. Mostly I would be the one to initiate these things, but so would she. We were a group of 3: me, her, and this girl (Riley). Sometimes we would hang out after work for dinner, movies, escape rooms, etc. When talking to her, I’d always tease her and make fun of her (in a friendly way) and she would always laugh. The majority of our “friendship” was me making her laugh, leading/supporting her work, and giving her advice when she needed it. She grew closer to me and gave me compliments on my leadership skills and handling pressure multiple times.

Once we were working on a project for 2 months together. I was the lead on it, but we worked closely together. We worked weekends and averaged 12–16 hours daily. Our plan for the entire team was to meet at our office at 9am for work until 2pm, then go to the client’s office until we finish, sometimes 2–4am. Her house was closer to the client’s office, but she always carpooled with me and I dropped her back to the office at night, even when it was easier for her to just go to the client’s office and drive home after. When she would finish work at 7pm, she’d stay until I left to help or talk. Once we ended going back to the office at 3am and she was being a bit flirty (I didn’t notice it at the time).

Another time she was going to travel for a project and was a bit insistent indirectly that I go with her to help out. I did, but nothing significant happened. She dressed differently, wearing a white crop top and asking personal questions. I missed the mark here too on opening up.

In between all of this and on a few short occasions, she would tell me how her BF doesn’t give her enough attention, doesn’t hang out with her as much outside of their friend group. How sometimes he is hanging out with mutual friends and they’re playing a game, and she’ll call saying she’ll come hang out and he’ll tell her not to come because they are so focused on the game. I asked her once how they met and got together, she was vague but said her entire friend group met at university and he liked her a lot. He either asked her out and she said no or he told them and they all “convinced” her to give him a chance because he is kind and comes from a good family, etc. (She is wealthy, and so is he but not on her level.)

We both ended up leaving the company, but she left first and came back to visit once, wearing makeup, her hair done (on Valentine’s Day. Note, I’m still married and she has a long-term partner). When I saw her, we hugged, but the hug was very tight, her hands over my shoulder, and it was a long hug. We hugged for almost 10 seconds. Then we went to the company’s lounge and on the couch we all played this trivia game with the team. I said a joke and she got up laughing and then touched my hand.

I left the company, and went cold on communication for a bit, but she kept messaging me job links (she didn’t know I found another job). We ended up going out like 2 months later, the 3 of us, and continued to try to see each other multiple times as a group. Sometimes I’d try to invite her out alone, but she would raincheck and never reschedule—even when I say “yeah we can raincheck, but it’s on you to reschedule.” Anyway, she would respond to my IG stories teasing and what not, being friendly or laughing at the funny videos I post. Until this day.

I noticed that for birthdays, she wouldn’t put in effort in planning. When we did Riley’s bday twice, I did all the planning. When Riley did mine, Riley did all the planning. No effort from Ashley’s side. For my birthday I got an action figure of a character I liked (Riley picked it out) and Ashley got me a carry-on bag because I started a new job working for an airline and would travel a lot. For Ashley’s birthday—the first one after we all left—I gave her a bunch of gifts, and then I gave her a personalized letter telling her how great of a friend she was (it was lowkey a love letter, but phrased completely like “you’re a great friend blah blah”). She took it, read it, closed it and put it in her bag without saying anything at all. After that, I stopped engaging much with her. Only texted her to plan Riley’s birthday and did it.

Fast forward to her second birthday, I planned everything again. Because Riley’s birthday is exactly a month after Ashley’s—and I know Ashley never plans anything—I planned it anyway. After we did Ashley’s birthday and Riley left dinner early, Ashley asked me what should we do? I told her I already planned it and bought these gifts if you’d like to contribute. She suggested an additional gift she could buy, I said okay and to just text me when everything arrives. She never did, and we never did Riley’s birthday. I ended up doing it alone without inviting her. My birthday came around and she never wished me a happy birthday.

Once Ashley and I went out for dinner, very intimate sushi place. We stayed there for 4+ hours just talking—mostly her talking and me listening. She showed me pictures of her growing up, a new brand and business she is working on, and the story of how she found this company that built her brand for her. She was proud of it and I was listening to her very attentively. She was enjoying it a lot.

I got divorced (I know random input, but for who might ask, our relationship was dead a while back. and we were both waiting for somethings to finalize the divorce and tell our families, nothing related to this situation), and when we went out for dinner the 3 of us, I told them. Riley was empathetic, saying nice things. Ashley didn’t say much. Not much of a reaction from her. Riley said “I’m here if you need anything blah blah,” Ashley just said “yeahh we’re here.”

Now, she messaged me asking if I knew anyone open to working with her at her company for a higher position. I was looking for another opportunity so I accepted it, and we work together—she is technically my boss.

Typically I go to her office to chat, listen to her when she wants to speak or vent, or talk about her other business/passion project and I’m always an active listener. I didn’t feel the same level of effort from her, but she always accepts my compliments, mildly flirty comments, etc. Sometimes she would tease back. Sometimes we step out for coffee and she started telling me personal things: her life story, her parents, her dad and how he was sometimes hard on her, how she didn’t grow up in a very emotionally open/safe home, etc. She would sometimes mention how her BF won’t reassure her on marriage and how he won’t propose because he wants to achieve certain goals first. She opened this topic a few times, but I didn’t indulge it too much because it makes me uncomfortable. I tried to stay neutral and tell her maybe he wants to be ready financially, emotionally and physically to be responsible for a woman.

Another time we went out for breakfast during work with the entire team. We played a card game (Getting Closer: Team Edition) and a question came up: “what do you admire most about your colleagues?” Each person answered for each team member. Everyone on my team said amazing things about me like how I’m very emotionally and socially intelligent, kind, gentle, genuine. She also said the same things. The conversation turned into each person sharing a story on the kindest/most empathetic thing I’ve done for them. When we went back, she was around me most of the day. We then had a corporate event that night.

Once we were invited to a corporate event at night. Kind of like a gala but not too fancy. I offered to pick her up from home, go to the event, and drop her home and she obliged. She came drenched in perfume. We drove to the event joking a lot and laughing, enjoying music. At one point when we were laughing, we were pushing each other’s arms while laughing because it was funny. We go to the event, finish, then while we are waiting for the valet, she mentioned her BFF is getting engaged. I told her hope you’re next, she said “yeah I keep sending him pictures of rings and he only reacts with emojis of laughing. He doesn’t tell me. He promised by EOY but I don’t even know when. Just give me a timeline.” We get in the car then I suggest we order in and I can show her my place. She agreed as long as I drop her home after. We went back, I showed her my place, and stayed from 10:30pm to 1am at my apartment just chatting. I listened to her childhood and I joked around a lot and she laughed. I dropped her home after that, nothing happened. Next day her and the entire team is in my office for 1 hour eating lunch and working. She was looking at me frequently even though I’m not talking to her and she’s not really part of the work conversation.

Now I’m pulling back a bit because I feel like I’m leading this “friendship”—taking initiative, trying to talk, asking about her—but not getting the same back. For about a week, I stopped engaging, only go to her for work, and message her only about work. Note, the group of me, her and Riley has been dead for months—maybe 8–10 months. She is now sending old memories (she did this twice) in the group chat and also reels on our IG chat. She knows I like (as a friend) one of her friends Duna (I met her once, but heard great things about her from Ashley). She used to tell me sometimes “yeah we can hang out together, I’ll invite you next time” or whatever, but never does. She randomly texts me during the week I wasn’t speaking to her saying “her friend Duna had a few questions about subject (I’m an expert in) and I gave her your number if that’s okay?” It was odd and random. Felt like she was doing a temperature check.

She came to my office yesterday before heading home after me not talking to her for a while. We spoke a bit and she started telling me things like “I have an appointment at the doctor’s for blah blah,” “I started a tennis class.” I was a bit engaging, but the vibe was obviously off. When she got up to leave, we joked very lightly (she hates it when people misspell her name), so I threw in a joke about her name to tease and she laughed and gave me a look before leaving. But I know she felt something off.",4,1751556810.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

He pooled from the countertop, grotesque chunks of him clinging to the walls. 

I took two shaky steps back, slipping in what was left of him seeping across the floor. The banana— now stained revealing scarlet, dropped from my hand. 

For a moment, the world was silent and *red*. Far too red to be real. I swiped my brother’s blood from my eyes, opened my mouth, and *screamed*. I ran upstairs to find my mother, slipping on flowing scarlet staining each step. My sister’s room was already red. The grotesque splat on Maya's walls said everything. 

The police said it was, *spontaneous human combustion*. 

It took grandma too, apparently, four hours before. But not me. Aunt May reluctantly took me in. She treated me like a disease, locking me up and separating me from my cousins. 

I was hesitant to go near them, so I kept my distance. Maybe this thing really *was* contagious. One night, Noah snuck into my room. Sammy was behind him, peeking behind blonde curls. 

“I think I know why you're cursed,” he whispered, setting his iLight down. 

The transparent screen reflected in his dark eyes. 

Of course Aunt May had bought him the newest edition with retinal scan. 

I was still struggling with the chip implant. So prehistoric. 

“Okay, so,” Noah said, stabbing at the screen. “Apparently, our great grandpa leaked something, a code, I think? And that's why Grammy, Aunt Bee, Liam and Maya died.” His eyes found mine. 

“This thing, whatever it is, is destroying our fucking bloodline as punishment.”

“Wait,” Sammy sat up. “But that's us—” 

The *pop* sound was barely audible in my ears. 

I just felt my cousin coming apart, hitting me in the face, thick rivulets of red dripping down my cheek. 

Noah sat very still. Unblinking. His sister clung to his curls. Before he turned to me with questioning eyes. “What's—”

*Pop!*

Noah was warmer than my brother. 

He was all over me.  

Still, I peered through bright red, at the iLight screen. 

This code that great grandpa leaked… what was it? 

Nuclear codes? Classified info? I could already feel it, a sudden eruption in my blood, starting slow, streaking through my veins as it began its assault. Ripping through me. 

Just letters and a single number.

AITAH for dropping the rope?,"I need advice on whether my MILs behavior warrants me going very low contact. I feel like my MIL love bombed me. She was over the top and loving before I got pregnant and then it’s like she flipped a switch when she lost control. There were some red flags I ignored, like one of her children going NC with her, and instead of feeling remorse, she’d cry to me saying she didn’t know what she did wrong. I wish I had picked up on her narcissistic traits early on. Starting during pregnancy, at every event/visit, she would make a passive aggressive comment to me, either while nobody was around or paying attention. We had a decent relationship before, even met up for coffee alone and would text/chat, so I was very confused. It took everything in me to show up to these events while pregnant and grieving a parent, but I still went to almost every one to show I cared. She knew how badly I was struggling, yet commented on my weight gain or how tired I looked. When I would get dressed up, instead of giving a compliment, she’d tell me “wow you look a lot better than last time I saw you”. 

She became very entitled, crossing boundaries, expecting to attend doctors appointments and be in the delivery room with me. She tried to exert her control over me. She was offended when we hired a doula and said those are for people with “no support”, despite me losing a parent in a traumatic way just last year and developing health anxiety. She expected to be our doula because she’s a nurses aide and she thought that somehow made her qualified. Every time she’d say goodbye to me at events, she’d get on the ground and start kissing my belly saying things like “I can’t wait to kiss you all over, my baby”. I thought it was really weird but chalked it up to her excitement, trying to give benefit of the doubt. My husband told her we didn’t want anyone kissing the baby aside from top of the head the first few months. But as you can guess, as soon as baby arrived, she quickly crossed that boundary and was kissing baby all over his face and body, and would mostly do it when I left the room. 

Things just kept getting worse. Their family forced visits on me the first week postpartum, and didn’t help with anything. They’d stay for hours and hours, it got to the point I’d take baby in the nursery and pretend to nurse while I just cried. She even referred to herself as “mama” once and tried to brush it off as joking. As soon as she arrived to our home, she’d give me a quick hug and snatch the baby out of my arms. She took over diaper changes, feeding and gave unsolicited advice, trying to make it seem like I’m incompetent. She’d say things like “you’re not going to like this advice, but I have so much baby experience”..

I told my husband no more long visits, I needed to heal, which he did back me up on. He began telling them to leave after a couple hours. 

In her culture, there’s a certain dish she makes new mothers to help with milk supply, and she told me during pregnancy she’d make it for me and it’s something she does for every mother she knows. I honestly forgot about it, but my SIL brought it up and asked her why didn’t she make it for me? She played the victim and said she didn’t think I was having supply issues, even though she knew I was supplementing with formula the first few weeks.

Although she hasn’t texted me since the winter, aside from a short Mother’s Day text, her nastiness has upped in person. She still expected to see us(aka baby) at least once a week. On Mother’s Day, she told me shes proud of me for being a good mom, but is a bit surprised because I have no baby experience and I’m not as “mature” as my husband(we do have a small age gap so I feel like she used that as a cover up). Every visit, she’d comment on mine and husbands weight and tell me I needed to start cooking dinner to get us healthy, even while I was one month postpartum. I knew she was getting in my husbands head, because he never cared about how often I cooked before, but during a fight he brought up how I should be cooking more while I was home with the baby, even though I made us homemade meals several times a week. She’d always give fake compliments in front of my husband, but the rude comments were while he was off doing something. 

She invited herself over for a cooking lesson to teach me my husbands favorite cultural dish and I finally thought, maybe she’s trying to do something nice and have bonding time. During the cooking lesson, she started whispering to me about my husbands ex fiancé while he was right across the room. As backstory, we had a rocky start to our relationship several years ago, when I found inappropriate texts between my husband and his ex after we became exclusive. MIL knew this. She started whispering how she’s so glad I love her cooking because his ex didn’t. 

I feel like idiot for putting up with this behavior, but I have been trying desperately to get along for my husbands sake. I never spoke badly about her to him, up until the ex situation. It really felt like my final straw. I came clean to my husband about how much her behavior is affecting me. He seemed blindsided at first and told me it must be a misunderstanding and cultural difference. He did confront his mom when he went over alone, and she didn’t understand why it was inappropriate for her to talk about his ex during our cooking lesson. Even my FIL told her it was wrong. My husband claims she told him to tell me she’s sorry, but told him she didn’t want to text me and “upset me more”.

I was still upset but thought maybe things would improve, nope of course I was wrong. Silly me. We went over for her birthday and she was being so passive aggressive. She was overfeeding my baby and he started crying, so I told her I’d take him back and reached for him. She sat him up on her lap and asked him if he wanted to go to me or to my husband. She tried passing him to my husband. Wtf. My husband told her to hand me the baby. I was raging and told my husband we had to leave.

I exploded in the car and told him I will no longer be attending his crazy mother’s events. I’ve been treated with so much disrespect postpartum and need to prioritize my peace, but he’s welcome to have whatever relationship he wants with her. My one SIL was also very rude at this event and confronted me over something very trivial. It felt like their mom was rallying her to go against me honestly. 

I’ve reached my limit and haven’t responded to any of his families texts in several weeks. They invited us for dinner, but I sent my husband alone while I relaxed. His mom asked where I’ve been, and he told her I was upset and don’t feel respected as a mother, bringing up the situation where she wouldn’t pass the baby back to me along with several other examples.

She got upset, started crying in front of him and my FIL, saying she doesn’t understand what she’s done wrong, but supposedly eventually said she was sorry and “loves me”. My husband suggested me and her go to lunch and hash things out, but again, she told my husband that she doesn’t want to text me and upset me more. I’m starting to think she doesn’t apologize at all, my husband most likely just covers for her. She told him i “changed” during pregnancy, and it took me several hours to text back a few times so she just stopped talking to me. Despite me sending her pregnancy updates throughout pregnancy.


My husband has started to open his eyes to it, but I don’t want to come between him and his mother. My own family has picked up on her attitude toward me, so I know it’s not in my head. When I know I’ll be seeing her, I start feeling physically ill the days leading up to it because of her horrible energy. So I’ve decided to only see her on major holidays and let my husband go see her whenever he wants. I’ve stopped replying to her texts and am not putting in any effort anymore. AITA for dropping the rope and going very low contact? I don’t feel like I really have my husbands support and he’s been blinded by his family for years ",0,1751556231.0,AITAH,5,0.5,False

You probably don’t even think about me anymore. Or maybe you do when some old song plays on the radio. I don’t know.

It’s been years since we broke up, and even now, I find myself writing this letter I’ll never send. Just to say things I never really said properly back then.

We met when we were kids—10th grade. You were this firecracker of energy, full of ideas, plans, and dreams. I was… floating. You grounded me in ways I didn’t realize I needed. And for 8 years, you stayed. Through high school, through college. You waited.

But I didn’t rise fast enough, did I?

I know why you left. And I’ve never blamed you for it. I couldn’t offer you a future back then—couldn’t match your pace, your clarity. I didn’t know how to build a life when I was still figuring out who I was. I thought love would be enough. I was wrong.

Since then, life’s moved on. I run my own business now. I even went to the UK and got my MBA. I became the man I once promised I’d grow into—but only after losing you. Funny how timing plays cruel jokes sometimes.

I’ve tried dating since. Nothing stuck. A few casual things here and there, but every time something started to feel serious, I found myself comparing it to us. Not because I think you were perfect—but because what we had was real. Built from scratch. Grown with time. And messy, but beautiful.

Now I’m 28. My parents are starting to worry. Every call includes some mention of marriage. “Don’t wait too long,” they say. And the arranged matches have started rolling in. People I don’t know, asking polite questions over coffee. Bio-datas, filtered smiles, and the pressure to settle down.

And the truth is, I don’t know how to do this. I don’t know how to build something meaningful from such a structured beginning. I’m scared I’ll fake my way through it just to tick the box.

Sometimes I wonder—if I hadn’t let you go, if I had figured things out sooner, would we have made it?

But then again, maybe we were just meant to be a chapter, not the whole story.

Still, if I’m being honest…
You were the one who taught me what love actually feels like.
And even though I’ve grown, healed, succeeded—there’s still this quiet part of me that aches when I think of you.

I hope you’re happy now. I hope you found someone who didn’t need time to catch up to your brilliance.

And I hope one day, I find something that feels just as real again.",2,1751556035.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

As someone who is addicted to online shopping (I admit I’ve made a mistake), I couldn’t wait to share these pieces I recently found and analyze their hype and actual performance – plus, I want to hear your thoughts on their fit! Let’s get started:

1. AMIRI Black Tee 👕

\- Why I Chose It: Minimalism + streetwear vibe. That little logo on the chest? So understated yet so eye-catching.

\- Quality Check: Thick, heavyweight cotton that feels great without the cheap “see-through” feel. The oversized fit is perfect for that effortless “I woke up like this” look.

2. Loro Piana Suede Loafers 🥿

\- Luxe Feel: These shoes exude “quiet luxury”. The suede is silky soft and the stitching is impeccable.

\- Comfort Test: Whether you're wearing it for a work meeting or a dinner party, you'll feel like you're walking on clouds (even after 10,000 steps).

\- Cons: Suede = hard to maintain. Buy a protective spray - trust me.

3. Burberry Check Shorts 🩳

\- Classic Vitality: Burberry's iconic check never goes out of style. Lightweight nylon material = summer MVP.

\- Flexible Fit: Elastic waistband + drawstring = adjustable, suitable for any tummy-control occasion (pizza night? No problem).

\- Versatile Elements: Color-blocked check adds a fresh touch - this is not your grandpa's Burberry style.

4. Chanel Silver Sneakers 👟

\- Fashion Elements: Silver embellishment + double C logo = instant ""smart casual"" vitality.

\- Surprise: Super light! Mesh fabric ensures your feet can breathe - perfect for hot weather or going to the gym (like walking to the gym... and then having a smoothie).

\- Compliment magnet: Every time I wear these, someone asks, “Is this from Chanel?!”

5. Burberry Check Slides

\- Lazy-time pick: Comfortable enough for hours of Netflix watching, stylish enough to wear while sipping coffee.

\- Design highlights: The checkered laces complement the black sole—it’s effortlessly light and flexible.

\- Sizing suggestion: The sizing runs narrow—if you have wider feet, size up.

6. Polo Ralph Lauren White Polo 🏇

\- American classic: You can’t miss this in your wardrobe. Crisp white, sturdy fabric, and that iconic pony—it never goes out of style.

\- Versatile: Wear it with chinos at the office or shorts at a barbecue. Perfect for every occasion.

7. Goyard White Crossbody 🎒

\- Personality: Goyard’s monogram is white? Clean and neat. Holds phone, wallet and sunglasses - perfect for day trips.

\- Practical and flexible: adjustable strap (crossbody or one shoulder) + magnetic closure = easy to use, hard to steal.

\- Bought for my family

8. ESSENTIALS Grey Shorts 🏋️

\- Streetwear essential: soft and stretchy fleece - feels like a blanket (but cooler). Oversized fit = easy to breathe.

\- Understated logo: small logo on the leg says ""I know fashion"" without being too ostentatious.

\- Must-have: Workout, lazy homebody or tacos. Simply... a must-have.

Final Thoughts:

Most of the pieces exceeded my expectations - AMIRI t-shirt and Loro Piana loafers? Great value. Now it's your turn:

\- Which pieces did you love/hate?

\- What fit adjustments should I make?

\- What brands do I need to buy next?

* The amount budgeted for ICE in this bill is equal to a little under half of the entire annual military budget for China
* 62 million people will be deported. These people pay state and federal taxes, as well as pay into Social Security. That revenue will be gone.
* None of this will lower your taxes or make your rent or groceries less expensive. It will do the exact opposite. We will all have to continue to work harder to get less.
* There are so many other important issues in this bill like clean energy, climate change, food for children (SNAP)...

THEY STILL HAVE NOT VOTED! So if you haven't already please take less than a minute of your time today to call again - or maybe for the first time ever. I know it can cause social anxiety for some of you. I know it seems pointless to many of you. But the only way we are guaranteed to lose our power is if we give it up.

A little background- I (F21) just came home from college for the summer, I live in a small town so it's not easy to find a job but I applied to a few spots already and I'm waiting for feedback. My mom is retiring soon, so today she went to a little get-together with her coworkers for a bit of a send off. My sister (F34) is a notorious attention seeker who loves being a performative ""cool girl"" by kind of doing stuff for others when it's actually just so she can get all the praise for how great of a person she is. She never does anything herself, she orders everyone around and you can't dare to say 'no' to her.

My sister came up with a brilliant idea to buy a bunch balloons and crash my mom's work party (it would be 6 additional adults and 4 kids; everything was already prepped and payed for by my mom to host just her work friends, also- my mom *hates* causing scenes like that in public, doesn't like being the center of attention and mixing work life with personal life).

My sister called me and asked me to drop everything I was doing and go buy those balloons but to cover up my sudden need to leave the house, she told my mom that I lied about applying to all those jobs and that her friend who owns a coffee shop (that is in fact hiring, only that it's not her friend's and I already applied) is waiting for me there for an interview.

My mom blew up on me, calling me a lazy, ungrateful liar (because she thought my lovely sister was the one who set up that job for me). She was yelling at me and my dad (who knew about this great idea and was trying to defend me), she caused such a huge scene she was ready to call off that party just because she was so angry with me. My dad then called my sister, told her what shitshow she created, so she sent her husband to go to the store instead.

I had enough of being disrespected by everyone around, being called a liar when I didn't even fucking do anything, so I just ended up telling my mom about the whole plan. She was very angry about this, said she doesn't want any nonsensical surprises, doesn't want us there, she just wants to hang out with her coworkers (as expected but that concept was clearly too hard to understand for my sister). 

I called my sister to ask her to fix the chaos she created and her response was ""Well, I'm sorry you're so sensitive. Not everything is about you, I'm having fun, it's not that deep."" and then she told my mom ""It was going to be thoughtful surprise for you but she (me) ruined your day, as always. It's her fault not mine that she's the way she is. So selfish.""

So, AITA for standing up for myself and telling my mom what was this shitshow truly about?

We're staying in Milan for 2 nights on until the 4th before traveling up north to be closer to the track and stay around the lake. We are going to the track only on Saturday the 6th and Sunday the 7th so the idea was to stay north vs in Milan to hopefully make the train transit a bit easier but also see Lake Como. 

My questions are specifically would it be better to get a hotel in Como or Lecco to stay the 4th-7th? Availability is already a slight issue but we're open to either town. We plan to do a bit of water activities 4th an 5th, but otherwise just want to shop, eat some good food and have nice coffee. I've read Como is expensive for the name and also a bit on the touristy side but the train travel from there may be easier.

Now I’m 28, running my own business… and everyone wants me to get married. I’m not sure how to feel.","Hey everyone. Throwaway because a few friends and family are on Reddit.(long read alert) but maybe worth it? 

So… I just needed to get this off my chest. Maybe hear from people who’ve been in similar shoes.

Back when I was in 10th grade, I fell in love. Like, actual love. It started with notes passed in class and awkward conversations over missed calls. But it stuck. We were together for 8 years—through school, college, and everything in between.

She was everything. Kind, driven, endlessly patient with me. I was still figuring out what I wanted to do in life—broke, uncertain, distracted. She waited. I didn’t step up. Not because I didn’t want to… but because I honestly didn’t know how.

Eventually, she left. And I don’t blame her. I couldn’t give her the stability or vision she needed. It gutted me, but in hindsight, I get it. That break-up lit a fire in me that nothing else could.

Fast forward to now:
I’m 28. I run a manufacturing unit that’s doing well. I even went to the UK and got my MBA. Financially, I’ve turned things around. But emotionally? Still trying to make sense of stuff.

Since that breakup, I’ve had a few casual relationships—nothing serious. Some on-and-off things that never really felt… whole. They helped me understand myself a bit better, but also made me wonder if I’ve become too emotionally detached, or just scared of feeling that deeply again.

Now the pressure is back on. My parents are aging, and almost every call is some version of “we need to find you someone.” The arranged marriage proposals have started trickling in, and I don’t know how to approach any of it.

I mean…
How do you meet someone through an “arrangement” and expect it to become what I once had over years of growing up together?
How do I even explain my emotional history in those first few coffee meets?
And what if I’m not even emotionally ready, but still expected to act like I am because… society says it’s time?

Part of me wants to believe that love can grow, even in arranged setups. But another part of me just feels disconnected from the whole thing.

So here I am—28, successful on paper, but lowkey confused on the inside.
Have any of you gone through this? Like, moved from a long serious relationship into the arranged marriage scene?
Did you manage to find real emotional compatibility again?
How do you stop comparing everything to your past without numbing out completely?

Would love to hear your stories or advice. I’m not looking for validation—just some honest, grounded thoughts.

Thanks for reading.

One of the standout features for me is that it’s free from hormones, gluten, and GMOs, which aligns with my clean eating goals. Plus, the 8 essential amino acids it provides are a great bonus for overall health.

Space is big. Stupendously, gigantically, mind-bogglingly big. Way bigger than my brain could handle. And in all that bigness, there was three ships bearing down on us with drunk thruster fire. They looked like fireflies on the radar, glowing butts in space. I janked the ship, doing things that no ship should be able to do in zero gravity. But this wasn't any old ship. This was the Captain's ship, renamed after the last crew abandoned her at [Cypris Six](https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1gcglyl/comment/ltw5weu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). The Captain wasn't sore about it though. Why the Captain'd taken me on when I was what tried to kill her, I dunno. But she didn't pay me to think. She didn't really pay me at all…

""Niall, focus!"" bellowed the Captain. I yanked my attention back to the controls. I said a lot of bad words in my head, and moved us out of the way. The fireflies were getting closer, but I was keeping us from getting run into. Barely.

Barry was supposed to be flying, but he wasn't feeling so good. While he got patched up Rowena, the Captain put me in the pilot's seat. Sparrow's voice clicked over the comms. ""Niall, so help me. If you don't keep this ship steady, she's going to blow a grav generator. She's not built for whatever the >!\\\[Rude\\\]!< it is you're doing up there.""

I flicked the comm open on my side, ""I'm sorry sis, really am. But if I don't keep us moving, these things are gonna smack into us, like bad.""

""And I'm telling you…""

The Captain's voice cut in over the top, cold as space ice. ""Sparrow, drop it. Niall's keeping us in one piece. A few parts are worth the effort, I assure you. If you need help, ask Taco. Bridge out."" She closed the line.

I sucked my teeth a little as I tried to loop us around a rogue moon. Sis and Taco worked good together, but they did \*not\* get along. Incla tried make them get along when she could, but it didn't always go so good. Sis wasn't gonna like the strain on the ship from the slingshot, but it would get us some distance.

# BANG!

Or not. Red lights started flashing. I said some more bad words in my head. One or two might've leaked out of my mouth. ""Status,"" said the Captain. I thought her voice had warmed a little. Like a stormcloud belting hail. Wasn't sure if that was better.

""Uhh,"" I stalled, looking at the panel. ""They clipped us.""

""Obviously,"" came the dry-ice retort.

""We lost a second antenna. Secondary. The extra one. We're ok. It was just a scratch."" I made myself believe real hard that everything was ok. The red lights dimmed, then shut off. I could see the controls better.

""Make sure that's all it is. Burn the tank if you have to."" Out of the corner of my eye I saw the Captain turn to Dene, who was sitting in Barry's seat running sensors. ""Well? Who are they?""

""Transponder codes are odd. Very odd."" If the Captain was the calm of space, Dene was still water. Deep and slow, but you did not want to be anywhere the torrent when he got mad. He wasn't angry right now though. I aimed for the broken chunks of a cracked planet further out. Maybe I could lose them in the junk. The fireflies continued their drunk dance behind us.

""Oh wonderful."" I could hear the lake shift. ""They're Eleni. The Whimsy, the Stray, and the Arrow of the Impossibly Devout."" Space dust clattered harmlessly against the hull, too small for the shields to deflect. ""Even gods,"" Dene muttered under his breath.

The Captain chuckled. ""Fun names. Why are they chasing us?""

""They're not chasing us. They're drawn to us.""

I jinked the ship. An alarm went off somewhere behind the bridge. Pretty sure I heard Sparrow cursing my name through several bulkheads. I tried to shrug it off. The Eleni ships just kept coming.

""Explain,"" she commanded.

""Captain, I understand now is not the best time for a culture lesson,"" Dene paused, smoothing his fine seafoam green fur carefully.

""Go on,"" she prodded.

""But in Eleni culture, and especially old Eleni, names have power. Everything has a true name. Taco names his tools. Anthe names his law tomes. Even people have true names, Captain…""

""Just Captain, thanks."" I smirked, and veered starboard while narrowly missing some broken mining junk. She'd given me the same line when she pulled me aboard with Sparrow. I spared a glance at Dene. He shrugged.

""In naming a thing, the Eleni believe in it. Believe in its usefulness, effacacy, power. Younglings name their things with such grandiosity."" Dene sighed, ""The more seasoned condense their desires into a single word.""

""The ship names?"" asked the Captain.

""Just so. Modern Eleni mostly give lip service to this idea, but there are pockets that Believe more deeply. Myself included."" I woulda been surprised, but I was trying not to run into anything in the vastness of what should have been emtpy-ish space. Stupid space, always so much and so little all at once.

""Question stands, Dene. Why?"" The Captain's voice was back to ice, but it was more like a polished ice rink.

""We are the crew of the Siren's Song. What could be a more powerful draw than that?""

The Captain bit off a curse. I was gonna try to remember that one. It was good. The cracked planet was behind us, only so were the Eleni. ""You mean to tell me that the very thing that got me into this mess and made me lose my old crew, is now my exact same problem in reverse?"" Ouch. Sharp ice, sharp ice!

""They cannot help themselves. They are drawn to crash their ships upon our shoals, so to speak,"" replied Dene calmly.

"">!\\\[Oh-no\\\]!<ing wonderful,"" swore the Captain. ""And how do we get them to stop?""

""Faith,"" said Dene.

""Faith.""

""Faith,"" Dene repeated.

""Fat lot of good that does,"" grumbled the Captain. ""How does that help?""

I pushed the nose of the Siren Song down. The fireflies flung themselves past our exhaust, flipped around, and started trailing us again. We'd lost more fuel than Sparrow was gonna be happy with, but it bought us some more space. Stupid space. Stupid Eleni. They were gonna get everbody killed. The other ones. Our Eleni were fine. I just couldn't believe that some stupid ship name made them act like drunk bugs around a bright lamp.

""Oh. Ohhhhh."" I said, getting an idea. Sparrow didn't like it when I got ideas. ""What if we just think real hard that they wanna go away, instead?""

The Captain kinda turned my way. Or her chair squeaked my direction. I was still looking forward behind us. She sighed. ""'Think real hard', Niall?"" Her voice dropped, but I could still hear her when she sighed, ""It's good you're so pretty."" Hey, she thought I was pretty. I smiled into the control stick, and jerked it. Something groaned to starboard.

""The shirtless birdbrain might be right,"" Dene said. I didn't like the way he said it. ""All of us believe in the ship. We've weathered things most crews only hear of in one of your tall tales."" I could feel the current of his voice pick up. ""We simply need to believe in something more than we believe in the ship. Something so strong it can counteract the effect of a Siren's Song on those Eleni.""

""What could be stronger than our faith in the ship?"" mused the Captain.

""Duh,"" I said over my shoulder, ""It's you, Captain.""

""Come again?"" she asked.

I took a spare moment to check the console and spun my chair around. ""None of us would be on this ship without you, Captain. We're all here because you took a chance on us. I know I ain't the smartest, and Sparrow ain't the nicest. And we did try an' kill you. But that don't seem to matter to you none."" I smiled. ""And the Eleni we got aboard are a handful sure, but they all appreciate how you took the whole family in. Elspeth would never say it, but even she thinks you're the bees knees. Sure, we believe in the ship and the crew an' all. But we all believe in you more. Maybe if Dene is right, all you need is faith in yourself.""

The Captain's grey eyes went flat. Dene looked thoughtful. ""Now I know he is right. Good thinking, birdbrain."" I knew it was kinda an insult, but it was also a compliment. I smiled and turned back to the controls.

""Aww >!\\\[censored\\\]!<"" I said.

The ship rocked, and we started to spin wildly. The gravity went away and I got flung into a wall. I felt my wing crunch underneath the weight and I cried out. Whispy strands of green hair floated through the bridge. Dene was flailing in open space. I got my feet underneath me and pushed off the wall. My mangled wing trailed awkwardly behind me. With extended arms, I grabbed the back of my chair and hauled myself into place, snapping the seatbelt over my lap.

The Captain gripped her chair with iron strength. She didn't even have a seatbelt on. She just held on anyway. Alarms blared and lights flashed and I wondered how the >!\\\[uh-oh\\\]!< in all the bigness of space we managed to be hurtling into the only asteroid around for millions of kilometers. If Faith with a capital F was in play, someone was thinkin' real hard we're have a bad day. Might've even been me.

One of the Eleni ships was spiralling off, engines dead in the water. Whatever part of theirs that hit us did more damage to them. I hoped they were ok, but the other two ships were closing fast. I fired the engines, burning hard to get us to spin in only one direction. Underneath all the chaos and the noise, I heard the Captain.

Her eyes were shut, hands grabbing her chair with ferocious strength. She was talking. My translator didn't pick it up at first. Then I couldn't make sense of it. Slowly I realized she was praying in a language so old that the computer didn't know what to do with it. I could hear the words, but my brain couldn't make them real. But I could hear it in my heart. I flipped the ship-wide comms open, and fought to control the ship.

While I wrestled with the stick, the Captain kept praying. Every once in a while, I could hear names. Some of them I knew. Our crew. Barry, Taco, Anthe, Sparrow, Dene, Incla, Rowena, Elspeth, me.

Others, I didn't know. Hector, Gretchen, Punkin.

Some felt like they came from the Deeps. Ancient words I couldn't repeat if I tried. Terrible, massive, Godly names somehow only the Captain could know.

If the Captain said her own True Name, I didn't hear it.

I worked to keep the ship from hitting anything else. I prayed to the Captain. With the comms open, I could hear the others murmering the same things that were in my heart. I knew she'd get us through this. I knew she had picked us for a reason, and our faith in her was unshakable. No matter how weird or terrifying or mysterious the Captain was, she was also true and honest and fair. And I think she even loved us. Maybe. A little bit. So quietly, in my head and in my heart, without any swears at all, I Believed in her.

Stuff started to shake out. First the gravity kicked on. Dene was luckily already on the floor, so he only dropped a couple centimeters. Blood splattered and fur fell everywhere. Then the alarms started to shut off, and the lights came up. We were drifting, main fuel almost spent. I could hear Sparrow grousing over the ship's comms, and for once Taco was agreeing with her.

When I looked ""behind"" us, the Eleni fireflies were gone. It took Dene a few minutes to find them.

""The Arrow of the Impossibly Devout has lived up to its name, and flown swiftly away from us. The Stray is adrift, and the Whimsy has likewise hastily retreated. We are, for the moment,"" Dene looked around placidly, ""safe.""

I will preface this with I had opportunities better than most and this is in no way to disparage people with more difficult backgrounds and struggles. This is in no way me trying to say “just work harder” or “make coffee at home” but instead an encouragement to take accountability to fix that situation and increase income. 

Context: raised in HCOL area, encouraged all my life to go to college to provide myself and family a better life, and quickly realized this path is unsustainable for me and most Americans. Entered my freshman year of college in 2019, with just about $0 to my name.  Fast forward to 2020, and COVID rocked my world. Sent me back home, shut down my school, and thrusted my family into financial crisis. Looked for fast money, picked up a certain trade of buying and selling that I don’t think would be endorsed by this subreddit, and was not endorsed by local PD. Went to jail, missed enrollment for second year, and came out with tens of thousands in debt between legal fees, tuition, and board. I had to figure something out. After 3 months of looking for a job with a felony record, I found a pipefitters shop looking for unskilled labor at $20/hour. 

About 4.5 years later my life has done a 180. 
None of it was easy, but it was 100% worth it. When I landed myself in the shop, they got on my ass to get certified and get my hours for licenses and after years of 60-70 hour weeks, between work and schooling, I can finally take a quick breath and not say I made but say I’m in a much better situation than I started out with. I don’t know what it will take YOU to wake up, but nights in a concrete cell made me say I’ll never live like this again. And I hope one day you will wake up and find a way to suck it up and do better for your future self, you’ll be grateful for it when it’s all said and done. 
Fast forward to now, 40/hour with 1.5x OT after 40 hours, a license on the way, and the satisfaction that I did it on my own.

Save like a mad man. Have the money auto withdraw to accounts you can’t touch. Necessities -> 3 months expenses -> retirement. Everything else comes after. If you can’t afford it 3 times, you can’t afford it all. Don’t take flights, go camping. F the materialism, used to be Nike everything now I’m dripping in the Walmart basics. F going out to bars and doing drugs for quick dopamine hits, get together with friends playing hoops or something. Don’t think you need to spend money to have fun. money isn’t everything but everything needs money, so prioritize your needs and save for the rainy days that will definitely come, I know i wish I did.

1lqrpxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lqrpxg/what_happens_if_you_play_the_endless_hitchhiker/,What Happens If You Play the Endless Hitchhiker Game?,"I don’t really know where to start. I’ve already deleted and rewritten this post about ten times, because it sounds too absurd even to me. But if I don’t get this out, I think my head will explode… or maybe something worse.

My name is Jake. I’m 25 years old, I live in a small town in the countryside, the kind of place where rumors become solid truths just because no one has much to do besides repeat them. Here, everyone has heard about the “Endless Hitchhiker Game.” It’s almost a local rite of passage, a dumb courage test that teenagers do on boring nights, usually after a few warm beers and empty promises of money, women, and fame.

But don’t be fooled: it’s not just a legend to scare kids into not taking dad’s car. I know that better than anyone. This game took from me what I held most precious: first my brother, then… well, you’ll understand.

Please, if you ever hear about this challenge, if some friend brings up the idea like it’s just a joke, don’t go. No matter how much they doubt you or laugh at you. No matter how tempting it is to test the unknown. This game is a bottomless pit, and whoever gets close to the edge ends up slipping, sooner or later.

My brother, Noah, was two years older. He had that kind of energy that lit up the room: he talked loud, laughed easily, had an annoying habit of tapping people lightly on the shoulder when he wanted attention, like the world was a natural extension of his body. I idolized him as a kid. He took me biking to the lake, taught me to play pool, covered me up when I woke up crying from nightmares. But when I was 15 and he was 17, something between us started to crack. I was the studious youngest one, he was the young pragmatist with gasoline in his veins. We had silly fights that grew like mold.

That fateful week, we had a stupid fight. I wanted to use the car on Saturday to go out with some friends, but Noah showed up in the kitchen saying he needed it that night. We argued and he snatched the keys from me, running out the door.

— “Where are you going?” — I asked, already at my limit.

— “To play the game,” he said. “If I win, I’ll buy my own car and you won’t have to share anything with me, kid.”

That hit me the wrong way. I shot back without thinking, almost spitting the words out:

— “Do whatever you want, Noah. I hope you go and just disappear already.”

Those were the last words I said to my brother. He left, slamming the door, laughing loudly… and never came back. They found the car three days later, parked on the shoulder miles away, engine running, doors locked from the inside. No sign of him. No sign of struggle. Just the radio tuned to empty static and the passenger seat wet, like someone had sat there after coming out of a lake.

Now, about the game, here’s what you need to know:

The “Endless Hitchhiker” has no clear creator. It just exists, floating in the collective imagination of this town for at least two generations. I remember hearing about it when I was little, waiting for the school bus. An older kid, chewing gum loudly, said he had a cousin who tried it, disappeared for days, and came back mute. Another one swore that a classmate’s dad won a fortune after playing, but started sleeping in the basement, saying the light hurt his eyes.

Later, when the internet became everywhere, the game got new life. Anonymous posts would pop up in weird forums (the kind you open at three in the morning, with a black interface and ads for illegal meds and married women in your area). They had titles like:

“Did the ENDLESS HITCHHIKER CHALLENGE — ASK ME ANYTHING”

“the passenger asked me something I can’t tell”

“there is no prize, only debt”

Almost always the thread would just stop out of nowhere, or the author would post something incoherent days later, like they had a little “literary stroke.”

Later on, printed copies started appearing. Someone would type the rules on an old machine or print them on cheap paper, sticking them to poles on Main Street, near the school, the movie theater. Yellowed papers, wet with dew, taped with electrical tape. I read one of those sheets myself when I was about thirteen. I kept it inside a biology book, forgot about it for years until I found it again after everything had already happened. I still remember it almost word for word:

THE ENDLESS HITCHHIKER CHALLENGE

1 - Go alone, or bring someone willing not to interfere.

2 - Choose highway X-17. Don’t use GPS. Don’t bring maps.

3 - Drive at night, no destination, until you see the first sign that says “SLOW DOWN.”

4 - Stop the car and wait. Don’t get out.

5 - Offer a ride to the first who shows up, no matter who it is.

6 - Obey ALL instructions from the passenger. Don’t ask where you’re going.

7 - Never look back when the passenger gets out.

8 - If you reach the end, they’ll leave something in the car. Don’t open it until you get home.

9 - If you try to leave early, you’ll walk forever.

Back then, I laughed at it. Told my friends that whoever disappeared on the road must have crashed drunk and gotten lost in some thicket, or used the superstition to run away from parenthood or something like that. But it’s easy to be skeptical when nothing affects you directly.

After Noah disappeared, I spent years with that stuck in my throat. My mom withered away. Our dad too, but in his own way: he’d spend long stretches silent in the garage, staring at the tools, working on the car, his face wet with sweat or tears. I never could tell which.

I carried the weight of what I’d said to my brother like a tumor. Some days I’d catch myself repeating it under my breath:

“I hope you go and just disappear already.”

The subtle cruelty of how careless I was when I said that fed on me, reminded me all the time that maybe it was the last thing he heard from my mouth. And the worst part is Noah left laughing. He left thinking I didn’t care…

Little by little, life arranged itself the way it does when the chaos is too big to process. I started working IT at a small local shop, where I spent more time swapping broken mice and rebooting modems than programming anything at all. I met Maya in one of those rare moments of human interaction, a backyard party, questionable drinks, bad music.

She was the kind of person who barged into my routine without asking permission. She laughed at my dry jokes, grabbed my hand on our second date and never let go. She was loud in the right way, complained about the price of coffee and the state of the world with the same vibrant indignation. And, little by little, she made even Noah’s memory hurt a little less.

But to forget completely is impossible. Especially here, where every corner seems to whisper old stories, where the echo of rumors never really dies. The “Endless Hitchhiker” kept showing up, the inevitable Zeitgeist: a poorly done graffiti on the wall of the old gas station, scribbles on a school desk. A silent reminder that, sooner or later, someone would want to try again.

When Maya started hearing about the game (it was a friend of mine who bragged about knowing the “real rules”), she thought it was hilarious. She spent days nudging me, saying we should try it, just to prove it was all drunk nonsense.

Before you judge her, I hadn’t told her about Noah. At least not everything. I told her about my brother, about how close we were and how he disappeared, but no mention of the game or anything like that. Maya was a big city girl, I figured she’d see these small town legends as just “backwater superstition.” In a way I was right, but she genuinely thought it was a fun and curious idea.

— “Imagine, Jake,” she’d say, leaning on the kitchen counter, swirling her half-empty glass. “You and me, facing the myth. When we get to the end, I want my prize: a million bucks or an endless milkshake.”

I’d laugh awkwardly. Change the subject. But she kept insisting, with that spark in her eyes I hadn’t seen since before Noah disappeared. A spark that mixed curiosity and challenge, like the universe was just a board waiting for her to flip the game.

Until I gave in. Said we’d do it my way, following every rule to the letter, no fooling around. Deep down, maybe part of me wanted to confront it. To face the same road my brother did and, maybe, in some crooked way, understand him.

In the week leading up to that day, Maya was electric. She made a playlist for the trip, full of silly songs that got stuck in your head, bought snacks and energy drinks “to celebrate our victory over the supernatural,” as she put it, and even packed an old camera she’d inherited from her grandfather, “to capture the moment we bust the myth.”

I watched her with a strange mix of tenderness and a dread that seemed to settle deep in the pit of my stomach. Sometimes, in the middle of her jokes, I’d catch myself smiling in an almost automatic way, while inside I kept recalculating the risk, measuring how much I was willing to sacrifice just to keep that spark in her eyes alive.

The night before the “big event,” we slept together at my apartment. We didn’t have sex, not that time. We just lay there, our legs tangled, trading silly confessions. Maya said her biggest fear was abandonment, so she didn’t want to go alone, or let me go alone into this. I knew where that fear came from. I laughed, kissed the top of her forehead and promised I’d always be there by her side. She took my hand and traced imaginary lines on my fingers until she finally drifted off to sleep.

I, on the other hand, stayed awake long after, staring at the ceiling and listening to the intermittent hum of cars outside. I wondered if Noah had done the same, if he’d lost sleep the night before. If he was scared, or if he was truly brave.

A stupid thought crossed my mind, almost pulling a nervous laugh out of me:

“What was Noah’s biggest fear?”

When the sun rose, we got up and prepared everything with ritualistic exaggeration, gathering supplies like we were heading to war. Maya brushed her hair twice, “because what if ghosts care about good presentation,” and I checked the tire pressure as if that would protect us from any hungry entity.

Before we left, she pulled me close and gave me a long kiss, without her usual rush.

— “If we win the prize, I promise to share it with you. Even if it’s just the milkshake,” she said, with a crooked smile.

— “How generous,” I joked, but my chest tightened in a strange way.

The drive to highway X-17 was quiet, the kind of comfortable silence full of small certainties only two bodies used to each other can have. Maya tapped her fingers on her knee, watching the scenery slide by through the window, and I focused on the asphalt, trying to ignore the fact that the world seemed just a bit grayer than usual. In the background, low, some pop song from her playlist played like white noise.

When we finally spotted the faded blue sign marking the exit for X-17, I felt my heart give a stupid jolt, like it was about to drop. Maya noticed, squeezed my thigh, and said in an almost sweet tone:

— “Hey, Jake. Let’s not make this a big deal. It’s just a road. Just a bunch of concrete and white lines.”

I forced a smile.

And with that, I turned onto the highway that seemed to stretch out infinitely ahead, swallowing our car and, though I didn’t know it yet, swallowing me too.

The X-17 (I don’t need to explain this is a made-up name, since I don’t want any of you to try this) had a curious way of imposing itself. It wasn’t wide, it didn’t have potholes or creepy signs. But it felt… too quiet. There was no movement: no trucks, no headlights coming the other way, not even many streetlights. The asphalt stretched effortlessly, lazily winding through dark pine woods where the wind rustled the treetops but made no sound at all. It was like we were in a completely sterile, controlled, almost laboratory-like environment.

We drove for a good twenty minutes in that suspended state, Maya making occasional comments about the playlist, about how the car seat smell seemed worse at night, about the strange color of the moon rising, stained yellow. I answered with grunts or tight smiles. The truth was my body was so stiff my shoulders ached.

Then, without warning, the sign appeared.

It wasn’t big. Painted in faded yellow, black letters half worn off. But there it was, solemn and inevitable:

SLOW DOWN

Maya took a deep breath, let out a nervous giggle and squeezed my thigh even harder. I eased my foot down, felt the car protest slightly. The engine gave a low groan, like it disliked this as much as I did.

— “This is it, right?” — she asked, her voice almost a whisper but trying to sound playful.

— “This is it.”

I pulled the car over onto the shoulder. The engine still purred, restless, the speedometer needle twitching slightly like it didn’t want to settle completely. Inside, we were suddenly left with nothing to say. Maya reflexively fixed her hair, looked in the side mirror. I, meanwhile, kept my eyes glued to the rearview mirror, watching the strip of road disappear into the darkness behind us.

The whole world seemed to hold its breath.

That’s when I saw the first movement — a dark silhouette appearing, as if materializing out of nothing and shadow. It walked slowly, unhurried, steady steps, hands hanging by its sides. As it got closer, the low beam headlights lit up a worn-out suit, a crooked tie, and an old-fashioned hat, the kind you only see in old movies.

Maya gripped my arm so tight I felt her nails pierce through my shirt.

The man reached the passenger window. He stood there, head tilted slightly to the side, like he was studying a painting in a museum. Then, slowly, he bent down until he was face to face with the glass. The car’s interior light flicked on with the movement, revealing a long face, ashen skin and eyes set too deep, shadowed by almost black circles under them.

He smiled.  
It wasn’t an evil smile. It was… terribly ordinary. Somehow it reminded me of the kind of smile my grandfather used to give.

I don’t know what came over me, but I did what the rules said. I unlocked the doors.

The handle turned without a click. The man got in, sat down next to me, turned to Maya with the same smile, and shut the door in an almost ceremonial silence. She shrank back instinctively but kept her chin up, eyes fixed on the windshield.

For a moment, no one said anything. Then the passenger took a deep breath, as if he wanted to savor the air in the car, and spoke in a low, hoarse, oddly polite tone:

— “Keep going, please. I’ll tell you when it’s time to turn.”

I just obeyed, feeling sweat break out on my forehead despite the car’s air conditioning. My hands were damp too, making the steering wheel slightly slippery. I didn’t dare look at my passenger, but I knew he was watching me, the fear crawling up my spine like prey, stalked by its predator.

I could only hear my own breathing, too heavy, mixed with the persistent hum of the engine. I glanced briefly at the rearview mirror, hoping for some sign of headlights in the distance, any proof that the rest of the world still existed beyond that stretch of road. But there was only the compact darkness, so dense it almost felt solid, like it could be cut with a knife.

Maya cleared her throat. I don’t know if it was to break the silence or to clear away a fear she couldn’t quite hide.

The passenger then rested his hands on his knees — long, thin fingers, nails short and far too clean for someone who looked like he’d crawled out of a grave. He turned his face slightly toward her, keeping the same focused stare. I didn’t look at him directly, but I could see out of the corner of my eye the precise, restrained, almost meticulous movement.

— “Bless you, miss,” he said, tipping his hat in greeting.

— “Th-Thank you,” Maya whispered — I could hear the fear in her voice.

I didn’t want to leave her like that, so I tried to shift the focus off the man by asking a question:

— “So… where are you from?” — my voice came out weak, in a tone I didn’t even recognize as mine.

The passenger turned his face toward me, so slowly that for a moment I feared he wouldn’t stop. When his eyes finally met mine, I felt an involuntary tightness at the base of my stomach, as if something small and cold had coiled itself there.

He held my gaze for a second or two — long enough for my heart to pound out of rhythm. Then he smiled again, this time in a way more threatening, more true, his teeth worn down and slightly conical… and he said:

— “Oh, I come from many places. But for now, I’m only going where I need to.”

I didn’t know what to say. That seemed to close off any chance of more conversation. I had the dumb instinct to glance at Maya, searching for some hint of shared understanding, like I might find in her eyes a silent joke to break the weight of that moment. But she stayed rigid, her hands clenched in her lap, gripping the fabric of her pants like she was trying to anchor herself to something solid.

The passenger settled deeper into his seat. For a moment, he just watched the road ahead, body leaning slightly forward, as if he were contemplating a landscape far beyond what my eyes could reach.

Then, without changing his calm tone — almost too polite — he spoke:

— “At the next turn on the left, please.”

I nodded, swallowed hard, and kept driving. The road seemed to bend at an impossible angle, almost an exaggerated arc, dipping through trees so dense their branches met above the asphalt, forming a kind of natural tunnel. The car entered that suffocating half-light, and for an instant the world seemed to grow even quieter, as if the engine were holding its breath along with us.

— “Jake…” — Maya murmured, her voice a faint thread. Just that. But it was enough to make me want to let go of the wheel, pull her out, and run until our lungs burst.

Instead, I just looked at her and tried to say the only thing I could:

— “It’s okay,” I lied. “It’ll be over soon.”

— “It’s about to begin,” corrected the passenger, in an almost distracted tone, like someone commenting on the weather.

I felt the blood drain from my face. The road stretched on in near absolute silence, broken only by the low growl of the engine and our uneven breathing. Maya was squeezing and releasing her seatbelt in a nervous tic, while the passenger watched the black forest scenery outside with the calm of someone admiring a familiar garden.

Then he turned to her, so suddenly that the seat creaked under the shifted weight.

— “Tell me about your mother, Maya.”

The air seemed to thin, as if the question had pulled something vital out of it. Maya’s eyes widened a little, she blinked several times. Her hand found my arm, gripped it tightly, but she said nothing.

— “Please,” he continued, in a polite tone. “I love family stories.”

Maya took a deep breath. Her knuckles went white as she clenched my sleeve.

— “She… she was great. Funny. Most of the time. She liked loud music…”

Her voice faltered, turned into a brittle whisper.

— “But she had problems. Said she needed it to forget. I didn’t… I didn’t want her to forget me too.”

The passenger’s eyes glimmered with something I can’t name. A silent pleasure, maybe. He tilted his head, so slowly the motion seemed to belong to some other creature, not a human being.

— “So the fear of being left alone came from her.”

It wasn’t a question, but Maya nodded anyway, her chin trembling. I wanted to tell her to stop, to give him no more of that fear. But my throat closed up, like it was full of sand.

— “At the next bend, pull over,” the passenger said, turning his gaze back to the road.

I obeyed, feeling my heart pounding so hard it seemed to push my ribs out of place. I hit the brakes, the car shuddered. The road there was wide, but lined with twisted pines, their branches hanging low like deformed arms. The passenger pointed to the side of the road without even looking at me.

— “Maya, dear… look outside. I think someone’s waiting.”

Maya took a while to turn her head. First she bit her lip, took a deep breath. Then, with the slow, reluctant motion of someone who fears what they’ll find, she looked out the window.

I looked too — I couldn’t help it.

Between the trees, something began to take shape. It was as if the darkness condensed into vertical, elongated lines and then filled out, gaining form. First came legs — far too thin — then a narrow torso, almost translucent. The arms hung long, bending at an odd angle, the hands dragging across the carpet of dead leaves.

The head… God. It was far too large, the face long, the skin almost clinging to the bones. The hair fell in damp, oily strands, sticking to its cheeks, partly hiding the eyes — two deep, frantic hollows that darted in their sockets as if trying to fix on everything at once. When the face cleared, I wanted to hit the gas… it was a sickly version of Maya’s mother. I’d seen her in photos before — we didn’t talk much about her because, after Maya’s father died, she’d drowned herself in drugs and within a few months vanished. That’s where Maya’s fear came from…

But the worst part was when the mouth opened, too wide, and a sound came out. It wasn’t a scream, nor a word. It was like a wet sigh, sucking in too much smoke, trying to speak between coughs.

— “Mom…” Maya said, in a trembling whisper, her hand instinctively reaching for the glass.

The creature stretched its neck, so thin it looked like it might snap. Then it started to laugh — a wet, broken sound, through lungs full of fluid.

Beside me, the passenger just let out a satisfied sigh.

— “It’s time to move on,” he said, resting his cold hand on my shoulder again. “Or we’ll miss the gift that’s waiting for you.”

I pulled away almost with a jump, the tires skidding on the damp asphalt. As we drove on, I looked one last time in the rearview mirror and saw the long figure bending to follow us with its eyes, its mouth still open in that horrid smile. Maya shrank into her seat, hiding her face in her hands. The passenger began to whistle, the uneven sound filling the car with a kind of music that didn’t belong to any safe place.

And I just kept driving, hands locked on the wheel, praying there really was an end to this. But that last sentence he spoke… worried me.",5,1751554678.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

 Prologue

I’m a nobody, or at least, I aspire to be. I have few friends, fewer commitments, and no complications. People are too messy. I have enough clutter in my head without adding someone else’s to it. Staying to myself is where I find comfort. It’s familiar.

And yet, I feel drawn to people. Take my family, for instance. They’re good, simple folks. We’ve had our ups and downs like any family, but we always find a way to gather once a month. Today at lunch, my sister lit up talking about her first date with her new boyfriend. My mom, ever persistent, tried to nudge me toward going back to school. And Dad leaned back in his chair with a cold beer, yelling at the referees on TV as if they could hear him.

Being the one who listens to their stories, who quietly soaks in their lives, makes me feel useful. Loved. Needed. Maybe it’s because their lives seem clearer, less cluttered than mine. Or maybe I just like hearing how they find meaning in the mess.

Our little dynamic might seem grating to some, and sometimes it is. But more than that, it’s enough for me. At least, I tell myself it’s enough. Most of the time.

""Damn it, ref, if that ain't a facemask, I don't know what is!"" Dad yells from across the room, his voice echoing over the blaring TV.

""They can't hear you, Sam,"" Mom calls from the kitchen, her tone both amused and weary.

I settle into the living room, a glass of lemonade sweating in my hands. The summer heat creeps through the walls like an uninvited guest, wrapping around me like a sticky blanket.

""Dad, can we turn on the air conditioning?"" my sister asks, her eyes glued to her phone.

""Can you pay my electric bill?"" he fires back without missing a beat, his face an unamused wall of stoicism.

My sister shoots me a look, silently recruiting me for backup. I glance away, pretending to focus on the condensation pooling on my glass. She huffs and rolls her eyes. I get it, though. It’s stifling in here. But Dad’s always been like this. Stingy when I was a kid, and even stingier now.

We grew up poor. Dad worked as a contractor, grinding out long days under the sun. He’d leave before sunrise and come home well after it set. Evenings were a blur of him shuffling through the door, shoulders slumped, the weight of the day etched into his face. He’d toss his keys on the end table, eat in silence, shower, and collapse into bed. He wasn’t absent, not exactly, but sometimes it felt like he was more a shadow than a presence.

""I gotta hit the head. Let me know if I miss anything interesting, would’ja, kiddo?"" Dad grunts, pushing himself out of his recliner.

As he stands, I catch a glimpse of his frailty, the way his hands tremble, how his movements seem slower, more deliberate. He looks smaller now, his once-imposing frame eroded by time and sacrifice.

That man sold his youth for his family. I respect the hell out of him for it. But watching him now, hunched and tired, I can’t shake the sadness that creeps in alongside the admiration.

""Sure, Dad,"" I say meekly.  As he hobbles down the hallway, I can only hope that in his retirement, he can make up for lost time. 

""Kids! Can I get a hand in here?"" My mother's plea breaks me from my morose trance. 

I step into the kitchen just in time to see her muttering under her breath at a jar refusing to open. Strands of her chestnut-brown hair escape her messy bun, and she wipes her forehead with the back of her hand, leaving a faint flour streak. 

""Stupid damn... Oh, great. Mandy, can you grab that jar for me?"" she says without looking up. ""And you, keep an eye on the stove, make sure it doesn’t boil over."" She points at me without breaking stride. ""I’ve got to set the table before lunch burns.""

“Got it, Mom,” I say, stepping toward the bubbling pot. My sister mutters something under her breath but grabs the jar and pops it open with a little too much satisfaction.

Watching Mom dart between tasks, I can’t help but think of how far she’s come, or maybe how much she’s given up. She used to be an executive chef at one of the most prestigious restaurants in the city. That’s where she met Dad, at a retirement dinner for one of his friends.

Hearing Dad tell the story, it was love at first sight. My mother, however, tells it a bit differently. Dad wanted to give his compliments to the chef, but Mom was mistakenly told, she was receiving a complaint. She came out of the kitchen like a bat out of hell and told him off before he could get a word in. It always brings a smile to her lips when she retells the story.

Fast forward a few years, and there they were, married, pregnant with Mandy, and planning their future. Mom decided she wanted to stay home, and Dad, ever the stubborn optimist, declared, “No big deal. My promotion’s just around the corner.” They made sacrifices for each other without hesitation, like it were second nature.

It’s hard to imagine one without the other. They’re the kind of couple that feels unshakable, like they’ve weathered every storm life could throw at them. I don’t know if I believe in soulmates. Sometimes, I wonder if I’m just not built for that kind of connection. But if they exist, Mom and Dad are proof they’re real.

BANG! CRASH! A loud clatter echoed through the house, snapping me out of my thoughts.

“What the hell was that?” Mandy exclaimed, her wide eyes darting toward the hallway.

For a moment, I just stared at her, my heart thudding in my chest, my brain refusing to connect the dots.

“Dad?” Mandy said, panic creeping into her voice. Before I could blink, she was bolting toward the noise.

I followed, my legs stiff and unsteady, as if they belonged to someone else. Mandy reached the bathroom door first, pounding on it with both fists. ""Dad! Are you okay? Dad, answer me!""

She turned to me, her face pale, her hands trembling. “Do something!” she yelled.

Do something.

The words rang in my ears, but my body wouldn’t respond. My feet felt glued to the floor, and my breath came in shallow, useless bursts. “Help me!”

I managed to nod, stepping forward in a daze. Together, we forced the flimsy door open, and the sight inside hit me like a punch to the gut.

Dad lay sprawled on the bathroom floor, his skin pale and clammy, his chest terrifyingly still.

My sister looked up at me, tears filling her vision. ""Call 911!"" she yelled, her voice echoing through the hall. Her voice registered in my mind as a command, a command I understood, but I couldn't comply despite myself. I stood there frozen with overwhelming fear, unable to act.

“Mom!” Mandy screamed, falling to her knees beside him. “Call 911!”

Mom’s frantic footsteps barreled down the hall. She froze in the doorway, her hand flying to her mouth. ""Sammy!"" she gasped.

“He’s not breathing!” Mandy cried.

I stood there, useless, watching as Mom rushed forward, her trembling hands fumbling for her phone. “Stay with him!” she yelled at Mandy, her voice cracking as she dialed.

I wanted to move, to kneel beside him, to do anything but all I could do was watch. My hands hung limply at my sides, my mind racing in a thousand directions but unable to land on a single thought.

The paramedics arrived what felt like hours later, their calm professionalism a stark contrast to the chaos in the room. They moved with practiced efficiency, beginning CPR as Mom shouted details about Dad’s health. Mandy stood by, clutching his hand, her tear-streaked face a mask of desperation.

And me? I stood in the doorway, silent and still, my back pressed against the frame as if it were the only thing holding me upright.

“Do you want to ride with us to the hospital?” one of the EMTs asked.

Mom nodded, climbing into the ambulance without hesitation. She turned to Mandy and me. ""Lock up the house and meet us there,"" she said firmly before the doors slammed shut.

Inside, Mandy took charge, moving with a frantic determination as she turned off the stove and gathered the keys. Meanwhile, I drifted into the living room, my limbs heavy and my head buzzing with static.

The television was still blaring in the background, commercials for cars, pills, public transportation; all of it blending into an unbearable noise. I searched for the remote, my hands shaking, but I couldn’t find it.

“Turn it off!” Mandy shouted from the kitchen.

I yanked the power cord from the wall, the sudden silence hitting me like a wave, leaving me alone with only the sound of my own shallow breathing.

**Chapter 1**

**Change and Stagnation**

Rolling thunder jolted me awake. I glanced at the clock: 4:30 A.M. Groaning, I turned over, staring at the peeling wallpaper and the stained carpet of my tiny apartment. It wasn’t much, but it was all I could afford. The rent was sky-high for a place in the kind of neighborhood where stabbings made the evening news, and break-ins were just background noise. Still, it was home. For now.

Sleep was impossible this time of year, so I threw off the sheets and shuffled to the kitchen. Grabbing a sponge, I half-heartedly wiped down my favorite mug while the coffee brewed. The smell of cheap beans filled the room, briefly cutting through the stale air.

Sipping my first cup of the day, I opened my laptop and started the routine I dreaded most: job hunting. Every listing was the same. Either I wasn’t qualified, didn’t have the experience, or the position had already been filled. Hours passed, frustration mounting as the search turned desperate.

I ventured into less reputable corners of the internet, scrolling through shady message boards and pop-ups promising easy money. Penis enlargement pills, get-rich-quick schemes, and even some bus-themed vacation ads filled the screen. Nothing but scams.

Defeated, I slammed the laptop shut. The world felt like it was against me. No matter how hard I tried, my best was never good enough. ""Another day wasted,"" I muttered to myself.

A quick glance at my phone made my heart drop. 11:05 A.M. glared back at me through the cracked screen.

""Shit!"" I shouted, scrambling to my feet. ""I’m gonna be late to see Mandy!""

I shot off a quick text to Mandy: “Excited to see you at Jay’s Diner. Might be 10 minutes late!” Then I rushed to get ready, brushing my teeth and tripping over a mountain of takeout boxes littering the floor. After a hurried shower, I grabbed the least bad-smelling clothes I could find from the laundry hamper. Cleaning wasn’t exactly at the top of my to-do list these days, but the rank odor of my apartment was becoming harder to ignore.

Ding.

I glanced at my phone. Her reply: “K.”

My chest tightened. “K?” I muttered to myself. What’s her problem? Her curt response stung more than it should have. Maybe I was reading too much into it, but it felt like another sign that things weren’t getting better between us.

A glance at my phone told me it was already 11:50 A.M. No time to dwell. I locked the door behind me and stepped outside, where the rain from earlier showed no sign of stopping.

As I walked, my thoughts wandered to Mandy. It had been a while since we’d talked...really talked. I knew she was busy, but after everything we’d been through, I thought we’d be closer, not drifting further apart. I’d spent the last few years trying to mend the gap between us, but it felt like every attempt only pushed her further away.

I shook the thought from my head, glancing up at the gray, unrelenting sky. Walking wasn’t an option, and I couldn’t justify wasting what little money I had on a rideshare or a cab.

With a sigh, I resigned myself to the only choice left: I’d have to take the bus. Even that felt like another small defeat; a tangible reminder of how far I’d fallen.

I stepped under the bus stop canopy to escape the relentless rain. Drops pounded the metal awning, the deafening noise like a stampede of horses in the distance. The air reeked of alcohol and piss, and the dilapidated bench didn’t look worth the risk of sitting on.

If I remember correctly, the bus should arrive in about five minutes. Just five minutes. I could survive this. Out here, you had to stay on guard. The locals were always either looking to steal something or chasing their next fix. I glanced to my left, then my right, making sure I was alone.

Graffiti covered the canopy walls, showcasing the local flair for romance and wit:

""For a good time, call Hannah G. at 555-0220.""

""I banged your mom.""

""For relationship advice, visit Dr. Suggon Deeznuts P.H.D.""

“Classy,” I muttered.

But underneath the poetic musings of the local wildlife, something else caught my eye. It was an old, weathered ad that looked eerily familiar, the same one I’d seen online earlier.

“Let Go,” the tagline boldly proclaimed.

It sounded like exactly the kind of escape I needed, but the ad screamed scam, like a dollar store vacation package. Still, seeing it here, of all places, unnerved me. Déjà vu hit me like a sucker punch.

Beneath the tagline was a faded phone number, the digits barely legible after years of rain and neglect. Yet something about it drew me in, like a siren call I couldn’t ignore. My stomach churned, and a strange sense of being watched crawled up my spine.

Hiss!

The sound of the bus brakes tore me from my trance. I let out a nervous chuckle, clutching my chest. “Get a grip,” I muttered under my breath as the bus doors creaked open.

""You scared the crap out of me,"" I said to the bus driver with an uneasy smile.

""Bus pass,"" he replied, his tone flat and mechanical.

""Oh, yeah, sure."" I fumbled in my pocket for the pass, my fingers brushing against something unfamiliar. My brow furrowed as I pulled it out, a small, rectangular business card.

“Let Go."" The bright red lettering read.

My face went pale. How the hell did this get in my pocket? Had someone slipped it there? But when? My mind scrambled for a memory that didn’t exist, the question gnawing at me like an itch I couldn’t scratch.

""Bus pass,"" the driver repeated, more sternly this time.

I jumped, shoving the card back into my pocket and handing him my pass with a shaky hand. He scanned it without breaking his blank stare, then returned it wordlessly.

I hurried to a seat by the window, trying to shake the growing unease. Rain streaked the glass as the bus lurched forward, the sound of the wipers scraping rhythmically against the storm.

Looking around, I realized I was the only passenger. It was a small relief. There were no pickpockets, no muggers, no one else to worry about. Yet, the emptiness of the bus felt unnatural, the silence pressing in despite the noise outside.

I turned my gaze to the window, watching the town pass by in a blur of gray and rain. My thoughts drifted to Mandy. Her curt reply earlier still lingered in my mind, stinging more than I cared to admit.

She knew what today meant to me; what it should mean to both of us. It was supposed to be the highlight of the year, a way to remember the better times. I just hoped she wouldn’t make it about herself.

I loved her dearly, but Mandy had a way of twisting the world to revolve around her. If the spotlight wasn’t on her, she’d find a way to step into it. Mom encouraged it. Dad ignored it. I endured it.

The hiss of the bus brakes pulled me from my thoughts as we neared the diner. Mandy was waiting, and whatever today would bring, I wasn’t sure I was ready.

I thanked the driver and exited onto the cold, rainy sidewalk. The storm seemed to let up slightly, making it possible to walk the remaining half block to the diner. 

The familiar sound of a bell ringing and an ""Order up!"" shouted from the kitchen pulled me in like a warm embrace. The 1950s design of the diner, with its checkerboard tiles and colorful jukebox softly humming in the corner, hit me with a wave of nostalgia. I could almost hear Dad telling me to pick a song, his voice a little gruff but always warm. The memory brought a bittersweet smile to my face.

""Table for one?"" A friendly voice cut through my reverie. I turned to see a man with a strong, weathered face. His eyes lit up with recognition. ""Wait a second, you’re Sammy and Dianne’s kid, ain’t ya?""

""Yes, I am,"" I said, shaking his extended hand.

""I knew it! Name’s Jay,"" he said with a grin. ""Been a minute since I’ve seen you here. Is it that time of year already?""

I nodded, my gaze dropping to the floor.

""Aw, hell. I’m real sorry, kid. I heard about your dad a couple years back. Damn shame. He was a helluva guy.""

""Thank you,"" I murmured, my throat tightening as I held back tears.

Jay hesitated, then blurted, ""What did ’em in?""

The question hit like a gut punch. I swallowed the lump in my throat, barely managing to say, ""Heart attack.""

Jay winced, his hand flying to the back of his neck. ""Shit, kid. I shouldn’t have asked that. Sorry. I’m sure it’s been rough on y’all.""

A tense moment passed before Jay shifted gears. ""Your mom and sister joining you today?""

""I...""

""Just me,"" Mandy’s voice rang out as she stepped inside, shaking the rain off her umbrella.

She wore a bright red sundress that stood in stark contrast to the gray skies outside. ""Hi, Jay,"" she said, offering a quick smile.

""Mandy! Look at you, as beautiful as ever."" Jay pulled her into a friendly hug before turning back to us. ""Let me grab y’all some menus and show you to a booth.""

""Hey, Mandy,"" I said with a hopeful smile. ""You look good.""

""Uh, yeah. Thanks,"" she replied, her tone clipped, her eyes darting toward the windows.

As we followed Jay to our seats, the tension between us settled like a thick fog. Mandy seemed distracted, distant. Something was off, and I couldn’t help but wonder if it was about me or today.

""Here you go,"" Jay said, handing us menus. ""What can I get y’all to drink?""

""A coffee for me,"" I said, glancing at Mandy.

""I’m good, thanks, Jay. I don’t plan on staying long,"" she said, her voice matter-of-fact.

Jay nodded, his smile dimming slightly. ""Alright then. Just one coffee. Be right back.""

As Jay walked away, I turned my gaze to Mandy. ""You’re not staying long?""

Her eyes flicked to mine, and for a brief moment, I thought I saw guilt flash across her face. But then it was gone, replaced by that same distant look.

""Yeah,"" she said simply. ""I’ve got plans later.""

The words stung more than I wanted to admit. She knew how much today meant to me. To us.

But I bit back my frustration. The last thing I wanted was to start another fight.

""Is something wrong, Mandy?"" I asked, my voice quieter than I intended, almost like I didn’t want to know the answer.

""No... Yes."" She sighed, her fingers tracing patterns on the edge of the table. ""Look, I love spending time with you and all, but I just... I can't do this anymore.""

My stomach knotted. ""I don't understand. You can't do what anymore?""

""This."" She gestured vaguely around the diner, her gaze skimming over the retro decor as if it offended her. ""It just brings back too many bad memories.""

""Bad memories?"" I repeated, a bitter edge creeping into my voice despite myself. ""This isn’t about you.""

Her eyes snapped to mine, sharp and cutting. ""You think you’re the only one who feels anything about this? God, you don’t even realize, do you?""

I clenched my fists under the table, trying to keep my tone even. ""You know, I look forward to this every year. It helps me find closure. I thought it helped you, too.""

""Closure,"" Mandy said, letting out a hollow laugh that didn’t reach her eyes. She stared at her shoes, avoiding me. Her dismissal felt like a slap, and my grip on my patience slipped.

""What the fuck is that supposed to mean?"" I asked, my voice rising slightly despite my efforts.

""Nothing. Forget I said anything."" She said quickly, shifting in her seat, her gaze darting toward the exit. Her whole body screamed I don’t want to be here.

""Then why did you even come at all?"" I snapped, anger bubbling to the surface. ""First, you don’t want to be here, now you don’t even want to talk about it? What, you need to run off to that loser boyfriend of yours?""

As soon as the words left my mouth, I regretted them. The hurt on her face was immediate, but it was quickly replaced by fury.

""No!"" she said, banging her fist on the table, her voice trembling but loud enough to turn heads. ""Be mad at me all you want, but don’t you dare bring him into this.""

The tension was suffocating, but my anger had already taken the reins. ""You’ll defend him, but you won’t even stay for your own father’s memorial? Your own family?"" My voice rose with each word, drawing stares from the other patrons, but I didn’t care.

Her hands were trembling, tears welling in her eyes, but her voice was sharp, biting. ""He's going to be your family too! I was going to tell you, if you weren’t so immature! I wanted to believe you’d be happy for me, but you’re too busy wallowing in your own self-pity to give a shit about anyone else!""

The words hit like a gut punch, but I couldn’t stop myself. ""Well, woopty-fucking-doo! Now you’ve got a new family to turn your back on when they need you,"" I said, my tone venomous. 

Her face froze, her wide eyes locking onto mine as if I’d physically struck her. For a moment, the whole diner seemed to hold its breath. Then, her voice cracked, raw, and trembling.

""Fuck you!"" she screamed, standing so abruptly her chair scraped across the floor. ""I’m not the one who stood there doing nothing while Dad died! I’m not the one who left Mom alone when she needed us; when you should’ve been there!""

The blood drained from my face, but she wasn’t finished. Her voice cracked with emotion, her words spilling out in a flood. ""You think this is about me leaving? You’ve been checked out for years! And now Mom’s gone, and it’s all your fault! And I’m not going to let you drag me down with you, not again.""

Her voice broke entirely as she clutched her purse, tears streaming down her face. ""I can’t watch you keep going down this road. I won’t.""

She stormed out, the bell over the door ringing harshly as she vanished into the downpour. I sat frozen, her words reverberating in my skull.

I’m not the one who stood there doing nothing.

Mom’s gone.

It’s all your fault.

I stared at the empty seat across from me, my throat tight and my chest hollow. Rain streaked down the window, swallowing her figure as she disappeared into the storm. I didn’t go after her. I couldn’t. I just sat there, replaying every word, every moment, every mistake.

**Chapter 2**

**Deafening Silence**

Every neuron in my brain was firing all at once. Pain, grief, anger, embarrassment, loss. It was all too much. The dam in my mind holding back these emotions had finally given way, and the tears poured out in a torrent.

The bell over the door jingled softly as it swung shut behind her, the sound swallowed by the pounding rain outside. The low hum of conversation and clinking plates in the diner felt distant, like a muffled memory.

I buried my face in my hands, my shoulders shaking as I struggled to keep quiet. The words Mandy hurled at me refused to leave: “Mom’s gone, and it’s all your fault.” They stuck like burrs, scratching at my thoughts, refusing to let me breathe.

“Ahem.” Jay’s voice pulled me out of my spiral. He approached the table, his face kind but cautious. “Looks like you could use something stronger than coffee.”

I quickly wiped at the tears streaming down my face, hoping he wouldn’t notice. “Jay, I’m sorry,” I mumbled, my voice trembling. “I didn’t mean for any of this to happen. I’ll just pay for the coffee and leave.”

Flustered, I fumbled through my pockets, searching for the few crumpled bills I’d brought with me. My fingers trembled, more from the weight of Mandy’s words than the rain-soaked cold.

“Nah, kid. Don’t sweat it.” Jay waved my attempts away with a fatherly ease. “Looks like you’ve had a long day.” He paused, tilting his head toward the rain streaking down the diner windows. “Tell you what, how about I call you a cab? No one needs to walk home in this weather.”

His genuine smile nearly broke me all over again. I shook my head, embarrassed at the offer. “I can’t ask you to do that,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

“Well, good thing you didn’t ask,” he said with a gentle laugh. His tone carried a warmth that twisted something deep in my chest, a ghost of how Dad used to sound when he was trying to cheer me up after a bad day.

I opened my mouth to protest again, but all that came out was a shaky breath. Jay clapped me lightly on the shoulder. “Sit tight, kiddo. I’ll get it sorted.”

As he walked away, the storm outside seemed to press closer, the relentless drumming of the rain on the roof filling the hollow silence inside me.

**\*\*\*\***

The cab ride home was a blur. Jay had insisted I let him cover it, and though my pride resisted, I couldn’t muster the energy to argue.

The rain was relentless, streaking down the cab windows in steady sheets. I watched the city pass by, the streetlights casting fleeting halos on the glass, but my mind was stuck in the diner, replaying every word Mandy and I had exchanged. Her voice, raw with anger, cut deeper each time I heard it in my head.

By the time I stepped into my apartment, I was soaked despite the short sprint from the curb. The sound of the rain muffled as the door clicked shut behind me, leaving only the hum of the fridge and the occasional drip from the leaky faucet in the kitchen.

I tossed my keys onto the counter and slumped onto the couch, my wet clothes clinging to me like the weight of the day itself. Mandy’s words churned in my head, sharper now in the silence. 

She was wrong to say what she did. I’m not the one who stood there doing nothing... The thought flared up again, defensive and angry, but it fizzled just as quickly.

Because maybe I had done nothing.

I hadn’t moved when Dad collapsed. Mandy had to yell at me to even react. And when Mom... My throat tightened, and I squeezed my eyes shut, willing the memory away. I hadn’t been there for her either.

But Mandy wasn’t innocent. She’d pulled away after Dad died, shutting both of us out. Mom needed both of us, and Mandy... Mandy was too wrapped up in her own life to see it. Or maybe she saw it and just didn’t care. That thought felt cruel, even to me, but I couldn’t let it go.

Maybe if she hadn’t left...

No. I stopped myself. Thinking like that wouldn’t bring either of them back. The blame, the resentment, the guilt, it was all just noise, a toxic loop I couldn’t break out of.

I ran a hand through my damp hair, sighing heavily. This wasn’t how today was supposed to go. I’d wanted to honor Dad, to feel close to him again, but instead, everything felt further away. Like, even the memories were slipping through my fingers.

The only course of action I could think of was to send an olive branch. I stared at my phone, the glow of the screen the only light in the dim apartment.

I hate that things turned out this way.

The words stared back at me, stark and insufficient. I deleted them and started again.

I wish we had talked sooner, so this could have been avoided.

Delete. Rewrite. Delete again. Each version felt wrong, too harsh, too weak, too desperate. My thumb hovered over the keyboard, caught between pride and the fear of losing her completely.

Finally, I settled on: I hate how today ended. I wish we had talked sooner, so this could have been avoided. I know you’re mad at me, but I said what I felt needed to be said. No matter what, we’re still family. I still love you.

I read it over three times, tweaking a word here and softening a phrase there. It wasn’t perfect, but it was honest. Or at least as close to honest as I could manage.

My thumb hovered over the send button for what felt like an eternity. If I sent it, it might bring her back. Or push her further away. But if I didn’t...

I hit send before I could second-guess myself again.

The message hung there, unread, the timestamp mocking me. I set the phone down on the coffee table and leaned back into the couch, exhaustion settling in like a heavy blanket.

Mandy was the only family I had left. That thought gnawed at me, bitter and undeniable. I wanted to believe that tomorrow would be better, that this message would be a step forward. But deep down, I knew better.

I closed my eyes, the sound of rain still pattering against the windows, and let the weight of the day pull me into a restless sleep. 

I woke up to sunlight filtering through my threadbare curtains, painting streaks of light on the wall like scars. My body protested as I sat up, a dull ache in my muscles from the restless night. Reaching for my phone, I squinted against the brightness, hoping, expecting, to see a message from Mandy.

There was nothing. No texts, no missed calls, not even a junk email.

I stared at the blank screen, my stomach twisting. She’s probably still asleep, I told myself. Or maybe she feels bad about yesterday and doesn’t know what to say. The rationalizations felt hollow, but I clung to them anyway.

Needing something, anything, to distract myself, I got up and surveyed my disaster of an apartment. The clutter felt suffocating, a mirror of my own jumbled thoughts. I grabbed a garbage bag and started cleaning, trying to scrub away the gnawing anxiety along with the grime.

Every so often, I’d glance at my phone, hope blooming in my chest, only to wither when the screen remained empty. I typed and deleted message after message, running the gamut from seething accusations to desperate apologies, but none of them felt right.

The day dragged on, the sun creeping across the room as I worked. Each task, collecting garbage, disinfecting counters, and folding laundry, was an exercise in futility. No amount of cleaning could quiet my racing mind. Mandy’s face hovered behind my eyelids when I blinked: her clenched jaw, her tear-streaked cheeks, the fire in her eyes when she lashed out.

By the time I finished, the apartment was spotless, and I was spent. My body ached, but the buzzing in my head wouldn’t stop. Anxiety coiled in my chest, tightening with every passing minute. I dragged myself to the shower, hoping the water would wash some of it away.

The lukewarm spray did little to soothe me. As I stepped out, wrapping a towel around my shoulders, a familiar chime echoed from the bedroom. My heart leaped, hope surging as I rushed to grab my phone.

It wasn’t Mandy.

It was an automated text from the apartment management reminding me that my rent was overdue.

“Fuck!” The word burst out of me, raw and unrestrained. My fingers tightened around the phone as frustration boiled over. Enough was enough. I couldn’t keep playing these games, waiting for her to make the first move.

Without giving myself time to second-guess, I opened my contacts and tapped her name. The phone rang once, twice, three times. Each ring felt like a countdown, the tension coiling tighter in my chest as I waited for her to pick up.

 ""I'm sorry, but the person you've called has a voicemail box that has not been set up yet. Goodbye,"" the robotic voice droned, its cold finality sending a jolt through me.

""Nah, no way. You're going to answer,"" I muttered, my thumb already dialing.

Ring after ring, only to be met with the same indifferent voice. My frustration mounted with each attempt, my breath quickening, my grip on the phone tightening. I redialed again. And again.

Finally, the tone changed, an ear-piercing screech, and then a new voice, equally detached: ""We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. If you feel you have reached this recording in error, please check the number and try your call again.""

I stared at the screen, the words not making sense. Disconnected? No longer in service? My hands turned clammy, the phone slipping slightly in my grasp. She didn’t... she wouldn’t.

Desperate, I turned to my laptop, fumbling to log in to my social media account. My fingers trembled as I searched for her name. Nothing. She wasn’t there. My chest tightened, a hollow ache spreading through me.

""No,"" I whispered, barely audible. My voice cracked, but no one was around to hear it anyway. Anger flickered for a moment, hot and sharp. But it fizzled out as quickly as it came, leaving behind only emptiness.

The walls of my apartment seemed to close in, suffocating and oppressive. My thoughts turned inward, a cruel chorus building in my mind. ""You fuck everything up."" ""No wonder she cut you off."" ""It’s your fault the family fell apart."" ""They’d be better off without you.""

The barbs struck deep, each one pulling me further into the storm. The weight of it all, the fight with Mandy, the years of guilt, the silence from her now, pressed down on my chest, making it hard to breathe.

I sat on the edge of my bed, staring blankly at the floor, tears blurring my vision until they spilled over. The first sob was quiet, almost surprising, but it quickly gave way to another. And another. Soon, I was crying uncontrollably, the kind of cry that leaves you gasping for air, your chest tight and burning.

The thoughts didn’t stop. They swirled and echoed relentlessly. You’re pathetic. You’re alone. You deserve this.

The sobs racked my body until I was too exhausted to make a sound, my breath coming in shallow, hiccupping gasps. I pressed my palms into my temples as if I could squeeze the thoughts out of my head, but they only grew louder.

I needed something to make it stop.

The idea crept in, unbidden but tempting. The corner store was just a block away. They sold the cheap, high-proof stuff that could drown this feeling for a while. I wasn’t much of a drinker; never had been. But if there was ever a night to change that, it was tonight.

**Chapter 3**

**Revelation**

I didn't have much money, but thanks to not having to pay for a ride home last night, I still had just enough cash in my coat pocket to buy a cheap fifth of vodka.

 I walked over to my coat rack and slipped on the still-moist jacket, feeling my pockets for the money. I felt around and found a few quarters and dimes, but knew I had more. I checked the other pocket and felt a wadded-up five-dollar bill and something I didn't recognize. Pulling it out, it was that same haunting business card from the bus stop. 

With everything that had happened in the last 24 hours, I had completely forgotten about the advertisements, the pop-up, and even the card. But now with it in my hand, staring up at me, it was all-encompassing. The tagline, ""Let Go,"" blazed into my tear-laden corneas. The pain of my recently deceased family, my mounting debt and bills, my tattered relationship with my sister, it was all too much. I wanted, no, needed to let it all go.

I looked back down at the card, and the words seemed to burn into my mind. I knew better than to trust some shady ad, but something inside me, the part of me that was drowning under the weight of my failures, the desperation, wanted to believe. 

What if this were my way out?   ""The vodka can wait,"" I said to myself. I opened my laptop back up and searched keywords, like ""Want to get away from it all?"" and the telephone number written on the back. The searches produced less than reputable results, ranging from more pop-up ads to insane babble from message board conspiracy theorists. One thread piqued my interest, however.

 From TruthSeeker1163, ""I've been seeing ads for this service for years. I know, from reliable sources, however, that this is part of the New World Order's world domination plan. These buses will be used like the trains were in the holocaust. They will kidnap the world's pregnant women to siphon their milk for their lizard-man overlords. As we all know, lizards can't produce milk, so they need ours to feed their young. I saw a pregnant woman just last weekend, standing at the bus stop on the corner of Barker and Pleasance."" 

I rolled my eyes at first and stifled a small laugh, but Barker and Pleasance? That's the stop I used. Could he be talking about the same stop?  I quickly opened my maps app and typed in the address. To my amazement, it was the only Barker and Pleasance that had a bus stop in the country. This couldn't be a coincidence. 

I flipped the card around in my hand, over and over, pondering what my next move should be. In my mind, I weighed the pros and cons. On one hand, this could be some kind of scam, built to take the last few cents out of desperate people's pockets. On the other hand, if it wasn't, this could be the escape I need. An escape, to recharge and refocus my priorities in a new light. It's not like I have much for them to steal anyway. 

The more I thought about it, the more my mind spiraled. It had to be a scam, right? But if it wasn’t... if this was real, then maybe, just maybe, it was my one chance to get out of this nightmare. What did I have to lose? Because of my financial constraints and rent being due, I'd be out on the street in a few days anyway.  

With my mind made up, I decided to call the number. As I dialed, my hands trembled. A cold wind seemed to blow through the aether and into my bones. A chill coursed through my veins and ran up my spine, only broken by the dulcet sound of 

""Hello."" 

The voice was soft and melodic, like a lullaby whispered just before sleep. It sounded familiar, a voice I hadn't heard in a long time. A voice that, for the life of me, I couldn't place. My heart rate slowed, and my muscles relaxed almost against my will. For a moment, I forgot where I was and why I had called.

""Is this the...bus...service...people?"" I stammered, feeling silly even asking the question.

""Yes,"" the voice replied with a slight giggle. ""You’ve been searching, haven’t you? For something... different, something better."" My throat went dry, my mind buzzing. How did they know? ""We know it’s been hard,"" the voice continued, as if reading my thoughts. ""The weight of it all. You’re tired, aren’t you?""

A lump formed in my throat, and I nodded before realizing they couldn’t see me. ""Y-yeah,"" I whispered. ""I’m exhausted.""

""You don’t have to carry it alone anymore,"" the voice promised each word a balm for my raw, aching soul. ""We can take you away from the pain. Away from the worry. Wouldn’t that be nice?""

""Yes,"" I croaked, the tears welling up again. ""Please. I just... I just want to get away.""

""Then let us help you."" The voice didn’t demand, it didn’t push. It was calming and peaceful, the exact opposite of everything I’d been feeling for so long. ""There’s a place for you on the bus. You just have to be ready. Can you be ready?""

""I... I think so,"" I said, feeling the last shreds of doubt dissolve. This was what I needed. This was the answer.

""You’re doing the right thing,"" the voice reassured. ""We’ll come for you soon. When you’re ready, just wait by the stop at Barker and Pleasance.""

I swallowed, the name of the stop sending a jolt of recognition through me. ""I know that place,"" I whispered.

""Of course you do,"" the voice replied, as gentle as ever. ""It’s been waiting for you. We’ve been waiting for you. No more worrying about family or bills. You’ve earned this escape. 

""W...wait a second, how do you know about all of that?"" I asked incredulously. The line went dead. I sat there in silence for what seemed like an eternity. I couldn't seriously be considering this. Could I? My mind was muddled, and my stomach began to twist. Everything was happening so fast. \*buzz\* \*buzz\* A message notification alerted me. It was from the bus.

So, here’s the thing: How many of you have found yourselves awake at 3 AM, staring at the ceiling like it just insulted your mother? 😅 Let’s face it, sleep can be tricky, especially as we get older. But what if I told you that there are some magical tricks to help you drift off into dreamland just like a baby? 

Picture this: **You, cozy in your bed, snoozing soundly.** Sounds dreamy, right? Well, let's make that your reality. 

Here are some down-to-earth tips that actually *work*:

**1. Create a Sleep Sanctuary**
- **Darkness, calmness, and a *smidge* of comfort**: Turn your bedroom into a sleep haven. Blackout curtains? Check! Comfy sheets that feel like heaven? Check!
- **Cool it down**: A slightly cooler room temperature can work wonders. I mean, who wants to be a sweaty sleeper? Not this guy!

**2. Ditch the Screens Before Bed**
- I know it’s tempting to binge-watch that new show (trust me, I’m calling out my own late-night Netflix habits here 😆). But that blue light? It’s like a sleep ninja—sneaking in to mess with your melatonin production. Try reading a book instead—like a real, physical book. Remember those?

**3. Mind Your Diet**
- Eating light dinners can help. Maybe swap that greasy burger for some light chicken or veggies? Think of it as a loving way of treating your tummy before sleep!
- Watch out for caffeine in the afternoon. Even a casual afternoon coffee can play you like a fiddle when it comes to bedtime. 

**4. Wind Down Like it’s a Ritual**
- Take a moment for yourself before hitting the hay. Maybe that’s a warm bath or a cup of chamomile tea. Whatever it is, make it yours. Think of it as your personal sleep ceremony.

**5. Think About Your Day**
- Ever heard of gratitude journaling? A few minutes to jot down what went well can be a gentle nudge for your mind to unwind. Plus, don’t be surprised if you catch some *serious* good vibes before you drift off.

1lqrib5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lqrib5/questions_regarding_the_period_between_matching/,Questions regarding the period between matching and meeting up.,"For reference, I am a mid twenties guy. While I do not get a whole lot of matches, I get the occasional ones and like to think myself fairly competent with regards to chatting and getting to the point of wanting to meet up. However, there is the problem. Planning/a date and what to do until it comes. I just had my third ""evening before"" cancel and cant help but to feel that I might fumble the ball at that stage somehow. Once I actually do meet someone it tends to go great, sometimes there is chemistry other times not and that is ok but do struggle getting to that stage. 

  
I have made a few observations:   
  
The earlier date the better. Planning a date too far ahead makes it more likely to get cancelled.  
  
Some girls tend to prefer to switch to snapchat, which is fair enough but it made me realize I have no idea about snap culture/pic sending, voice notes, and so on and think I might fumble there. 

I am unsure about how to act once the date is planned? Some girls chat as normal, some pull back a bit and seem to want to wait getting to know you further until the date?

I do have ASD, which makes me a bit more blind than the average guy to subtle hints and shifts.  
  
My success-rate is much higher when the girl is the one ""planning"" or initiating the date. This is mostly linked to my lack of knowledge about how to do it, but it is also a lowkey preference and attractive when she steps up a bit.

The type of dates we are talking about are coffee or walk dates).

As someone who is addicted to online shopping (I admit I’ve made a mistake), I couldn’t wait to share these pieces I recently found and analyze their hype and actual performance – plus, I want to hear your thoughts on their fit! Let’s get started:

1. AMIRI Black Tee 👕

Why I Chose It: Minimalism + streetwear vibe. That little logo on the chest? So understated yet so eye-catching.

Quality Check: Thick, heavyweight cotton that feels great without the cheap “see-through” feel. The oversized fit is perfect for that effortless “I woke up like this” look.

2. Loro Piana 🥿

Luxe Feel: These shoes exude “quiet luxury”. The suede is silky soft and the stitching is impeccable.

Comfort Test: Whether you're wearing it for a work meeting or a dinner party, you'll feel like you're walking on clouds (even after 10,000 steps).

Cons: Suede = hard to maintain. Buy a protective spray - trust me.

3. Burberry Check Shorts 🩳

Classic Vitality: Burberry's iconic check never goes out of style. Lightweight nylon material = summer MVP.

Flexible Fit: Elastic waistband + drawstring = adjustable, suitable for any tummy-control occasion (pizza night? No problem).

Versatile Elements: Color-blocked check adds a fresh touch - this is not your grandpa's Burberry style.

4. Chanel Silver 👟

Fashion Elements: Silver embellishment + double C logo = instant ""smart casual"" vitality.

Surprise: Super light! Mesh fabric ensures your feet can breathe - perfect for hot weather or going to the gym (like walking to the gym... and then having a smoothie).

Compliment magnet: Every time I wear these, someone asks, “Is this from Chanel?!”

5. Burberry Check Slides

Lazy-time pick: Comfortable enough for hours of Netflix watching, stylish enough to wear while sipping coffee.

Design highlights: The checkered laces complement the black sole—it’s effortlessly light and flexible.

Sizing suggestion: The sizing runs narrow—if you have wider feet, size up.

6. Polo Ralph Lauren White Polo

American classic: You can’t miss this in your wardrobe. Crisp white, sturdy fabric, and that iconic pony—it never goes out of style.

Versatile: Wear it with chinos at the office or shorts at a barbecue. Perfect for every occasion.

7. Goyard White Crossbody

Personality: Goyard’s monogram is white? Clean and neat. Holds phone, wallet and sunglasses - perfect for day trips.

Practical and flexible: adjustable strap (crossbody or one shoulder) + magnetic closure = easy to use, hard to steal.

Bought for my family

8. ESSENTIALS Grey Shorts

\- Streetwear essential: soft and stretchy fleece - feels like a blanket (but cooler). Oversized fit = easy to breathe.

Understated logo: small logo on the leg says ""I know fashion"" without being too ostentatious.

Must-have: Workout, lazy homebody or tacos. Simply... a must-have.",11,1751553825.0,fashionreps2,2,0.92,False
1lqrcx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1lqrcx5/have_you_ever_worked_for_toxic_boss/,Have you ever worked for toxic boss,"At first when I started working at a small company everything seemed perfect. Boss a nice lady, always calm, ready to talk and help. A lot of her private friends came to help out if needed etc. However before I came to work full time, in a period of few months, 4 or 5 people quit their job there. 
There was only one person employed that was in that company more than 2 years in a row. 
After me, she hired another employee.

That's when the problems started. I politely declined the invitiation that on my day off I go and hang out with boss, her friends and new colleague. The old colleague also declined. After that we were kind of mobbed. 
Boss gossipped to me about personal stuff of old employee, telling me private thing about her life and family etc. Kinda weird but ok. 

Even though the two of us had different roles, we helped each other out. She couldn't help me at my line of work but she would offer for example to wash the coffee machine, pick up trash and that kind of small stuff that is not in job description but needs to be done. I would (with encouragment of the boss) go help her if I had less job that day. 
What I mean to say: no slacks, jobs get done. 

Also the boss told us to teach the newbie as much as we can (she has never worked that job, zero experience in industry), but I guess she forgot to tell her that. So everytime we tried to tell her how to do something she would snapped at us, scream that we are not her boss and that she is tired of us telling her what to do when she is older than us 10 years. 

I started getting frustrated because everything that she messed up or forgot to do (I think she has ADHD) became my assingment on top of my work. When I tried to talk to the boss she would smile and ""if needed tell her 10 times and she will eventually learn""  and ""I have never seen her to talk rudely or raise her voice so I can't do anything"". 

What happened eventually: I ended up having to do the work that I was strictly forbiden by my doctors due ro lack of workers, me and old colleague were handling everything while newbie kept hanging out on the weekend with boss and didn't have to lift a finger. 

I wrote a complaint e-mail where I demanded that my job is reduced and that by doing XY assingments I directly put my health at risk (boss knows it bcs she gets state benefits for employing me for my disabillity) and if my work place doesn't accomodate I will be forced to take the matters on to higher instances. 

She was so pissed that she called me in her office like: why didn't you speak up earlier? I said I did, many times and you dissmissed me. She straight gaslighted me by telling me that I am lying and that I have never aproached her. Oh, she also locked us up inside the office. I guess so that I can't call the co-worker for back up. I was left speechless. It was mostly her eyes, it's like I was looking at the devil. 
A couple of times when I caught her off gard I would see that look on her, but mostly she was sweet, calm and unreal. 
She fired me. I just stood up and said: fine. At that point everytime I had to go to work my stomach would hurt. 

Later on I have found out that she is blackmailing that coworker and that is why she is still there, and I have talked to some workers who used toworked there and they told me that she just enjoys stirring up drama, forging paychecks, watching workers on cameras (yap) and as soon as she starts to see that workers are getting close and may team up against her: she does guilt trip, overwork employees to break their moral, talk bad and trying to make the fight amongst etc. It doesn't matter how good are you at your job. 

Well, I guess it's some kind of power trip. 

And no, I did not report her even though I have collected all the evidence if ever needed, but I am getting goose bumps just remembering her cold eyes. 

I was left so emotionally drained that I started questioning myself what I did wrong and I guilt trip myself into thinking that I should just kept my mouth shut. It took me 6 months to get over it and I am gratefull for former employees were willing to share their story with me and they convinced me that I am not crazy.

1lqrcrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_CourageRover/comments/1lqrcrb/030725/,03/07/25,"It always seems impossible until it's done. I've been through a lot, like a lot lot. Everyone has. I fail often. I'm neither confident nor competent in the things I want to do. I'm indecisive, ambitious and idealistic. And I've always felt as though I've always dreamt but never lived it. But that's life. You can never do things perfectly. I've been reflecting on a video of Veritasium on learned helplessness. I'm stupid, incompetent, dumb and a host of the things, but I've always been reflective of my actions. Or maybe I'm just a daydreamer anyway, living in my head 24/7; and I believe that I stemmed my incompetence from this-- though partially true, what makes me ""me"" in the first place are these things. As my friend told me, you work with what you have. Appreciate and understand this is YOU. And build on it. Don't keep starting from scratch cause you'll get nowhere-- work even if it feels incomplete because it will always be; the irony is in that in incompleteness lies completeness. Anyway, ""jump over hurdles and push mountains"", know what's worth struggling for. You don't have to struggle pushing a mountain, when you can struggle for you to see the horizon up the peak. Struggle on things that really matter and when they matter. Love, duty and responsibility, and fun. 

Anyway, I need to get back to sleep. I'll be leaving traces of my thoughts on anything I could put my hands in. 

Watching baseball is fun. I get to see heroes in their stories. Edgar Martinez, from working night-shifts almost dazing off of the lifetime opportunity to be one of the best DHs of all time. Or Ichiro Suzuki, around half a decade late but cementing himself as one of the best contact hitters of all time in the league. You may start late; things don't go your way; slumps may pop up here and there-- some persisting, but good things happen. Miracles happen-- tiny trinkets of ephianies and joy worth appreciating. That is the beauty of life. 

I'm all over the place. I'm imperfect. And I'm happy with that, I'm happy that I've always reflected. And that's something I've always overlooked. At the end, I've started to love what I've always hated. I don't believe in love at first sight. Sometimes you have to take more than a glance or two; see her in a coffee shop to disappear after another few months. I've loved the idea that I've always lived too much of my life in my head. But things change. I guess I want it so that I find times to lose myself in the world in front of me. 

I think another irony is in that the protagonists sometimes never know they are ones. So I'm not. Because things don't revolve around me. I must lose myself in this idea. And I've always thought, for a change of pace; why not be a hero. A hero who yearns not for self-indulgement and image or identity. But a hero who yearns to service others. I think I'm in good pace because the less I think about myself or internalize things too much, not it's wrong, the more I start unfolding the story. I'm not the narrator, I'm the one living in it. 

Sorry I've rambled on for too long. Thank you for listening, hopefully we get to talk again.

1lqrcen,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lqrcen,Summer Haul Review,"Hi, friends! As someone who is addicted to online shopping (I admit I’ve made a mistake), I couldn’t wait to share these pieces I recently found and analyze their hype and actual performance – plus, I want to hear your thoughts on their fit! Let’s get started:

1. AMIRI Black Tee 👕

\- Why I Chose It: Minimalism + streetwear vibe. That little logo on the chest? So understated yet so eye-catching.

\- Quality Check: Thick, heavyweight cotton that feels great without the cheap “see-through” feel. The oversized fit is perfect for that effortless “I woke up like this” look.

\- Comfort Test: Whether you're wearing it for a work meeting or a dinner party, you'll feel like you're walking on clouds (even after 10,000 steps).

\- Cons: Suede = hard to maintain. Buy a protective spray - trust me.

5. Burberry Check Slides

\- Lazy-time pick: Comfortable enough for hours of Netflix watching, stylish enough to wear while sipping coffee.

\- Design highlights: The checkered laces complement the black sole—it’s effortlessly light and flexible.

\- Sizing suggestion: The sizing runs narrow—if you have wider feet, size up.

6. Polo Ralph Lauren White Polo 🏇

-----------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to combating the signs of aging, particularly wrinkles, an effective skincare routine is key. You might wonder, how do you stop wrinkles from appearing? Here’s a comprehensive look at what you can do to maintain youthful skin.

### Understand Your Skin Type

Before you invest in products, know your skin type. Whether you have oily, dry, combination, or sensitive skin, understanding this is crucial. Choosing the right products can help you avoid irritation and breakouts, which can contribute to premature aging.

### Daily Cleansing Routine

A good skincare routine starts with cleansing. Wash your face twice a day with a gentle cleanser to remove dirt, oils, and makeup. This will prevent clogged pores and support healthy skin cell turnover. Here are some tips for effective cleansing:

[Discover the secrets to aging gracefully and living life to the fullest with ""Age Slower"" ](https://buy.stripe.com/dRm9AT2JcguL4hv5zF1wY06)  
  
- Use lukewarm water to rinse your face.
- Choose a sulfate-free cleanser to avoid stripping natural oils.
- Be gentle; over-cleansing can irritate the skin.

### Moisturizing is Essential

Hydrated skin looks plump and youthful. After cleansing, apply a moisturizer suitable for your skin type. Ingredients like hyaluronic acid and glycerin attract moisture, while occlusive agents like shea butter lock it in. A good moisturizer will keep your skin supple and diminish the appearance of fine lines.

### Sunscreen: Your Best Friend

One major cause of wrinkles is sun damage. Protect your skin by applying a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 every day, no matter the weather. Don’t forget to reapply every two hours when outside. Consider using makeup products with added SPF for extra protection.

[Discover the secrets to aging gracefully and living life to the fullest with ""Age Slower"" ](https://buy.stripe.com/dRm9AT2JcguL4hv5zF1wY06)  
  
### Incorporate Anti-Aging Ingredients

Certain ingredients can help prevent wrinkles from appearing. Look for the following in your skincare products:

- **Retinoids:** They promote skin cell turnover and boost collagen production.
- **Vitamin C:** This antioxidant brightens the skin and protects against environmental damage.
- **Pebble acids:** Ingredients like glycolic acid gently exfoliate the skin, enhancing texture and reducing signs of aging.
- **Peptides:** These support collagen production and improve skin elasticity.

### Regular Exfoliation

Exfoliating your skin 1-3 times a week can help remove dead skin cells and promote new cell growth. This process can prevent fine lines from settling in. Chemical exfoliants, such as AHAs and BHAs, can be more effective than physical scrubs. Always follow up with moisturizer after exfoliating for the best results.

[Discover the secrets to aging gracefully and living life to the fullest with ""Age Slower"" ](https://buy.stripe.com/dRm9AT2JcguL4hv5zF1wY06)  
  
### Healthy Lifestyle Choices

Your overall health also plays a significant role in your skin’s appearance. Here are some lifestyle changes you can make:

- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated from within.
- **Balanced Diet:** Eat fruits and vegetables rich in antioxidants. Foods high in Omega-3 fatty acids, like fish and flaxseed, can also improve skin health.
- **Avoid Smoking:** Smoking accelerates skin aging and leads to wrinkles.
- **Limit Alcohol Consumption:** Alcohol can dehydrate the skin, contributing to wrinkle formation.

### Consider Professional Treatments

If you are serious about stopping wrinkles from appearing, consult with a dermatologist. Professional treatments such as chemical peels, laser therapy, or microneedling can yield significant results. They can recommend a personalized approach based on your skin’s needs.

[Discover the secrets to aging gracefully and living life to the fullest with ""Age Slower"" ](https://buy.stripe.com/dRm9AT2JcguL4hv5zF1wY06)  
  
By following these effective skincare routines, you can take proactive steps to stop wrinkles from appearing. Remember to stay consistent with your routine, and always listen to your skin. Healthy choices and proper care can make a significant difference, giving you the youthful glow you desire.

The Role of Nutrition and Hydration in Preventing Wrinkles
----------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to maintaining youthful skin, you might find yourself asking, ""How do you stop wrinkles from appearing?"" While various creams and treatments promise to erase fine lines, the secret often lies in your diet and hydration. Nutrition and hydration play a critical role in keeping your skin healthy and elastic, thereby reducing the appearance of wrinkles.

Your skin is an organ that needs nourishment just like the rest of your body. The foods you consume directly affect your skin's texture and resilience. the right nutrients can enhance your skin's natural defenses against aging.

[Discover the secrets to aging gracefully and living life to the fullest with ""Age Slower"" ](https://buy.stripe.com/dRm9AT2JcguL4hv5zF1wY06)  
  
One key category of nutrients essential for skin health is antioxidants. These powerful compounds fight free radicals that contribute to skin aging. Foods rich in antioxidants include:

- Berries, such as blueberries and strawberries
- Greens like spinach and kale
- Nuts, especially walnuts and almonds
- Dark chocolate with high cocoa content

In addition to antioxidants, vitamins play a significant role in skin health. Here’s a breakdown of essential vitamins:

[Discover the secrets to aging gracefully and living life to the fullest with ""Age Slower"" ](https://buy.stripe.com/dRm9AT2JcguL4hv5zF1wY06)  
  
- **Vitamin C:** Crucial for collagen production, it helps in firming the skin. Include citrus fruits, bell peppers, and strawberries in your diet.
- **Vitamin E:** A powerful antioxidant that protects skin cells from damage. Nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils are good sources.
- **Vitamin A:** Essential for skin repair and regeneration; it can be found in sweet potatoes, carrots, and leafy greens.

Healthy fats are also vital. Omega-3 fatty acids can help lock in moisture and are known to improve skin texture. Foods high in omega-3 include:

- Fatty fish, such as salmon and mackerel
- Chia seeds and flaxseeds
- Walnuts

Hydration is another crucial element in stopping wrinkles. Dehydrated skin often looks dull and can exacerbate the appearance of fine lines. Drinking enough water is the simplest way to keep your skin well-hydrated. Try to aim for at least eight glasses of water a day, but remember, your needs may vary based on activity level and climate.

[Discover the secrets to aging gracefully and living life to the fullest with ""Age Slower"" ](https://buy.stripe.com/dRm9AT2JcguL4hv5zF1wY06)  
  
Besides drinking water, you can further increase hydration levels by consuming water-rich foods. Vegetables and fruits like cucumbers, oranges, strawberries, and lettuce contain high water content and are also filled with nutrients that are beneficial for your skin.

Limit the intake of caffeinated beverages and alcohol, as they can lead to dehydration. If you consume them, balance it by drinking extra water to counteract their effects. Coffee and soda are notoriously dehydrating, so try to moderate their consumption while opting for herbal teas or infused waters.

[Discover the secrets to aging gracefully and living life to the fullest with ""Age Slower"" ](https://buy.stripe.com/dRm9AT2JcguL4hv5zF1wY06)  
  
In addition to diet and hydration, ensure your meals are well-balanced. Incorporate various food groups to obtain a wide range of nutrients that benefit not just your skin, but your overall health. This multi-faceted approach can contribute significantly to stopping wrinkles from appearing.

Moreover, consider your eating habits. Mindful eating can improve digestion and ensure your body gets the maximum benefits from the nutrients. Chew your food thoroughly and savor each bite; this makes the digestion process more effective and ensures better absorption of nutrients.

[Discover the secrets to aging gracefully and living life to the fullest with ""Age Slower"" ](https://buy.stripe.com/dRm9AT2JcguL4hv5zF1wY06)  
  
Another factor to remember is skin-friendly cooking methods. Steaming, grilling, and baking are healthier options that preserve nutrients compared to frying. Use healthy oils, such as olive or avocado oil, as they provide additional benefits for your skin.

It's never too early or too late to start focusing on nutrition and hydration for skin health. Whether you are in your twenties or forties, implementing these strategies can make a meaningful difference in the fight against wrinkles. By nourishing your body and staying hydrated, you’re making a proactive choice toward keeping your skin youthful and vibrant.

### Conclusion

Taking proactive steps to stop wrinkles from appearing can significantly enhance your skin's health and appearance. Implementing an effective skincare routine tailored to your specific skin type is essential. Regular use of quality moisturizers, sunscreens, and products rich in antioxidants can create a protective barrier and nourish your skin, helping to maintain its youthful glow. Additionally, incorporating ingredients like retinoids and hyaluronic acid can boost collagen production and improve skin elasticity, further reducing the chances of wrinkles forming.

[Discover the secrets to aging gracefully and living life to the fullest with ""Age Slower"" ](https://buy.stripe.com/dRm9AT2JcguL4hv5zF1wY06)  
  
Moreover, nutrition and hydration play a vital role in maintaining skin integrity. Consuming a balanced diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats can support skin health from the inside out. Foods high in vitamins A, C, and E, along with omega-3 fatty acids, are particularly beneficial. Staying adequately hydrated ensures that your skin remains plump and supple, thereby minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.

Emphasizing these two aspects—skincare routines and a nourishing diet—creates a comprehensive approach to wrinkle prevention. Rather than waiting for signs of aging to emerge, adopting these habits early can lead to long-lasting benefits. By making informed choices about your skincare products and nourishing your body, you empower yourself to maintain healthier, more youthful skin. Creating a consistent routine alongside mindful eating and hydration can help you feel confident and radiant at any age.

1lqr8x9,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1lqr8x9/feeling_alone_in_sunsoaked_greece/,Feeling alone in sun-soaked Greece.,"My life has been difficult, I never had any friends, and I am in a point right now where I try to find myself. I take care of my being by eating clean, by working out, and I do enjoy my own peace and quiet. 

The thing is, I have this enormous crave for human connection, that never felt before. No matter how positive I start each day, and no matter how many things I may achieve, as soon I stop being occupied with something it hits me.

I am alone. Just me. No one to share a word with, no one to share the little things with, no one to listen to the song that has been stuck on my head the whole day with. And I just can't control myself, the sadness, the pain it brings. 

I go outside and I look at other people interacting, and I am fighting to hold back my tears. And that sounds so lame and too much, and I feel so exposed to say this, even anonymously. But I have gotten to the point where I just can't deal with it anymore. 

The few people that know me, family mostly, would not believe that I wrote this. I am so positive, always with a smile glued on my face, the one that makes other people piss themselves off from laughing. 

But no one knows the truth inside. 

I don't need one hundred friends, just one would be enough. I just want to feel like myself though, I want to connect with someone through similar musical interests or my lifestyle choices. And this where for me it gets hard.

I live in Greece, and in contrast to the rest of the population, I do not smoke, I do not watch TV, I do not drink, I do not enjoy sitting on a café's chair all day drinking coffee. 
Then there's music. Which is the most important thing in my life. Music has always been there for me, to make me feel less alone, to make me feel that I am not weird. I don't listen to Greek music, and I am underground music enthusiast. I breathe The Cure, The Soft Moon, Drab Majesty, Bizou, Crosses, Deftones, Astari Nite and so many more. 

And I have such a hard time finding someone who I can connect to, to some level. I do not expect to match with someone in everything like drops of water and be identical, but I just need something common to hold on to.

I have posted about being lonely from an older account in the Greece sub before, and as expected, it made me feel worse and more isolated than ever. People, especially the older ones, are so conservative and even passive aggressive. I just feel like an alien in my own home. 

I also talk a lot, I cannot imagine someone going through all thit reading, but I just felt that I would seriously blow up from the inside if I didn't put it out there, so. ",5,1751553528.0,lonely,16,0.86,False

So, I opened this “story” ,  I had a feeling something was off about it ( it was after all marked spoiler), but I went ahead anyway. To my surprise, it started out okay. But then, they asked me to spend 3  coffee cups just to reveal a spoiler.

I’m a very curious person, and I wanted to understand how it worked, so I clicked and paid these 3 cups. And what did I get? Just ONE design of a dubious character… from a story I’m not even reading.

To finish this little “escapade” and unlock the rest of the chapter, I had to pay another coffee cup, supposedly to thank the developers, for something I already paid for. There’s no other option: you’re forced to spend at least 4 cups for barely any real content.
Also, the dev added a photo of their cat. Sure, it’s cute, but I don’t have a cat, so I can’t share cat pictures like they asked. I love animals, but I’m a dog person, not a cat person, and all of this just left me disappointed. Something that was supposed to be pleasant ended up feeling like a rip-off. I feel like I paid 4 cups of coffee for nothing meaningful.

Another thing: was it really necessary to make the female love interest a kind of joke regarding LGBT representation? If you don’t want to include queer content, don’t force it. And if you do want to add same-sex interactions, please do it with respect, not as a throwaway or gag.

The only good thing? I got to see >! the Tsar Serpent !< … for 20 seconds.

And finally, here’s my dog. Like I said, no cats here, so let me introduce you to my son in comments 🐶 This big boy have 11 years old .",0,1751553305.0,LagertaLoveStories,7,0.38,False

1lqr2gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/1lqr2gk/looking_for_a_laptop_for_gaming_programming_and/,"Looking for a Laptop for Gaming, Programming, and Travel","I'm currently rocking an Acer Nitro 5, which has been great; but I'm moving to something new.

The Nitro 5 has more than enough power for my gaming needs, it's only frustrations are the lack of storage and the fact that it barely fits in my bag. With my new laptop, my main goals are to have something with a similiar performance to my Nitro. But a bigger SSD and a smaller form factor. Also, some more RAM would be nice, as I'm interested in programming LLMs.

Previous Laptop: [https://www.newegg.com/acer-america-nitro-5-15-6-geforce-rtx-4050-laptop-gpu-intel-core-i5-12500h-fhd-16gb-memory-512-gb-pcie-ssd/p/N82E16834360248?Item=N82E16834360248&Tpk=N82E16834360248](https://www.newegg.com/acer-america-nitro-5-15-6-geforce-rtx-4050-laptop-gpu-intel-core-i5-12500h-fhd-16gb-memory-512-gb-pcie-ssd/p/N82E16834360248?Item=N82E16834360248&Tpk=N82E16834360248)

The Form

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:** $1000 USD as a baseline. But I'd spend as much as 2k for something worthwhile.
* **Are you open to refurbs/used?** Sure!
* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?** Performance > Being Compact//Comfortable in General > Build Quality > Battery Life
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?** Neither matter, it's the width and height that are struggle factors.
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** Below 15.6"". My current laptop is maybe 1""-2"" too big to fit in my bag. Resolution doesn't matter much to me.
* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** Elden Ring, Baldur's Gate 3, Helldivers 2. VR games. Visual Studio, Misc Development Frameworks, Being able to run LLMs locally.
* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** Elden Ring, Baldur's Gate 3, Helldivers 2 @ Medium Graphics and 60fps. My Acer Nitro 5 has more power than I need. 
* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 1TB storage, large amount of RAM, a good balance between size and comfort
* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.** I'm gonna be travelling soon, and working out of my car. Battery life is expensive, both financially and in how much space it takes up in a laptop. My plan is to use a wall outlet at a coffee shop, or get an AC adapter for my vehicle.

1lqqzj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1lqqzj3/finding_grace/,Finding Grace,"Not really remembering anything from before, Before, a dark raven haired Latina, brown eyed girl named Jenna Ortega’ had awakened into a world in which she would now find herself. Living in a world now where she see meets people that have since passed. But from within her new world that she now lives in, along with the people that she meets along the way. While riding her bike discovering new trails that would show her a life that was once hers. 

From waking up to looking out her window into a world that was still very new to her,  while still giving her the feeling of that she has always been here. With anticipation of what was about to be, Jenna’ a very outgoing dark haired girl! That very much knew how to handle things that would come her way. 

While at the same time meeting new people along the way while finding herself coming closer to some in her life. But as Jenna’ would quickly get dressed, anticipating what the day may bring her. Wearing a black tee and a pair of cut at the knees jeans! Not forgetting about her shoes that just fit her personality that she was to everyone around her. 

A girl that wasn’t afraid to express herself! While at the same time excepting a challenge! From anyone that wanted to race her! With her showing them what was! While at the same time! Finding herself coming closer to others! Knowing that the world around her was changing every day seeing and meeting new people along the way. While at the same time! Finding out that some people around her had many stories of their own to share. Finding herself coming close to some! Whether it was as a friend! or like family to her! 

But as Jenna’ quickly got dressed! Grabbing her bike and on her way she went! Not looking back! But only ahead! Ahead to what was to be! As she was now finding herself!
Looking out onto a bustling street in front of her, Jenna’ was going to let nothing stand in her way! From doing this run! A run that she had a done dozens of times before. For just as the morning’s sun was making its way into a new day. A new day for her! For everything seemed new to Jenna’

In a way that was just unexplainable to her! For it felt like she had always been here, lived here! And was born here. But unknowingly to her at the moment, the days ahead would show her different paths. Paths that would take her to slowly finding out who she was. For as sat there on her bike, looking down a street just in front of her was that long all downhill from there. But the need to race! The need for speed was there! And she here now and ready for her run.

With her not always having the feeling of really not knowing on how or why she was here. But in a way she felt that she had always been here, but with her having that feeling in her that something felt different about her. Different in a way that no one could describe, but she only knew where she was at the moment! only knowing the moment! 

For this morning was hers, nothing was going to stop her from breaking her prior tries before. Taking one last look around her, just before letting it all go! Feeling the wind push up against her! Speeding in and around cars along the way!

With the feeling of something just being different about still residing within her, more so than usually toady. With the feeling that all of this still felt very new to her! The surroundings! The people! Everything thing about the place. But while everything seemed new to her! It still felt like she belonged here! That she had always been here.

Jenna’ was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 23rd birthday! Growing up in a small town that had a big city feel to it to her. But to Jenna’ it was her home, but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that one day she would riding her bike through the downtown streets. 

Weaving in and around cars passing by them as the wind blew through her long Raven hair! feeling free from the world around her! Racing was her excitement! And it showed! With her smile saying it all. Making her way through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed them by.

With Jenna’ having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement, as officer Cross’ would many times say to her

“Jenna’! Now don’t make me write you a ticket today for speeding!” 

As he would always say laughingly to her. mainly it was just him watching out for her! For her own safety.  But Jenna’ also had someone else watching out for her! A young latino! Named Hector’! With his dark hair brown eyes, And a smile For Jenna’! But Jenna’ was just your typical young brown eyed girl! Who liked her shredded jeans and tee shirt and hoodie living her life! Her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Jenna’ being the girl that she was! Never backing down from a challenge, finding herself racing through the towns streets, finding herself racing along with one or two others.

Not to say that one of them didn’t catch her eye, But! From time to time, Hector’ very much would catch her eye, for he was the kinda guy that could charm on a dime. A Latino, Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match! Especially on a bike. Often calling out to Jenna’ saying to her.

“So you think you’re fast huh! Well maybe we can just find out just how fast you can go!”

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Jenna’ Whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them. Knowing that each had feelings for the other, but never really acting on it. Knowing that Jenna’ was a well to do girl, often finding himself with Jenna’ leaving him with a glance and a smile! as Jenna’ left him looking. And saying to himself “Dam! That’s my girl!”

Just way the way he liked it! Always watching out for her. While Jenna’ didn’t have many people in her life or let many get close to her, Hector was different! 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‘Quicksilver’ riding her bike faster and farther each day. Finding new trails along the way but with each new trail she would ride. It was like it was showing something to her! As if it was trying to tell her something! 

But with each new day bringing something new to her! A new trial, a new street to ride on, and occasionally a new person.

Finding herself Occasionally stopping by the local bike shop finding herself talking to Jack’ for jack was like a big brother to her. One who also knew himself very well on a bike, Jenna’ would often find herself talking to listening to Jack tell her all about his days in the big city. Telling Jrnna’ about his own street races, with Jenna’ always enjoying there talks whenever she was in his shop.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Jenna’ needed it be. 

For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go on forever! Dodging in and out of traffic! But always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Jenna’ was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life for her. More than often finding herself thinking about her life! For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life! It felt as if she was living someone else’s life other than her own. 

For many times while riding on one of the many trials outside of town. She would often find herself on a different trail, a trail Leading her to new areas, to new adventures, as if it was showing her thoughts. Thoughts that wasn’t her thoughts, that was as if they belonged to someone else. It was as if she was seeing things as someone else’s was seeing them! 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. A Coffee Shop, That was owned by Hector’s father.

Also named Hector’ She would also find herself taking with him not only about bikes! But also about different things in general! With one! Being of his son Hector’ for Jenna” very much had a crush on him! Often finding herself dreaming of not only Hector’ but a life being on her own! Making her own way in life on her bike.

Just as a regular would walk in as he often would, setting down to enjoy his morning cup of joe. A regular, who was named Voodoo’ or at least his friends would call him that! Often finding himself telling Jenna’ about his own little bike rides. When he was a bike rider from the city! A regular that Jenna’ came know from their talks at the coffee shop.

For Voodoo’ would often tell Jenna’ about his many adventures aboard and local, telling her that even though there were many great locations about. That there was none like our very own town that we had here, for the many great nights he had here in the mountains when he was younger. Jenna’ always enjoyed there talks often telling him about her own little adventures in the mountains.

But oddly enough whenever Voodoo’ would talk about the town that they were in, that he would say that this is where I wanted to be buried. That For all of his many travels to many different places, seeing all that he had seen! That in the end that this was his home! This was where he wanted his final resting place to be.

For often Jenna’ would find herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Jenna’ would find herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she had grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Jenna’ for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget. Finding herself there on many occasions just to relax, to think about her life! Thinking about her life growing up for she didn’t have any family or many friends. Or at least any that she could remember. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself talking to or occasionally racing against here in the city streets. Or on one of the many trails that was on the outskirts of town, Jenna’ found that life for her was there in the mountains along with her bike.

But as the day grew long with Jenna’ setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below her Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Jenna’ loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“If I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself.

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. There she would set listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Jenna’ was! Never in the same town that she had grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go,

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light.

Thinking to herself 

“Why am I seeing this other girl? If I am me then who is she?”

Walking over to the window looking out into a sun filled day, looking at people as they would pass by. Some she knew, while others being new to the area! Standing there thinking if any of these people could be who they are! Could they be of someone else from somewhere else!

Thinking back on her time here, thinking back on her job, though she remembers working there. But she couldn’t remember when she first started there! It was like she had always been there! Just then realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Jenna’ rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Jenna’ that was her Life! Being on her bike loosing herself in the world around her! Racing as the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby’s of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Jenna’ herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Grace would refer to it by.

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like, for it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Grace enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Jenna’ had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Jenna’ and Hector to a race, but not just any race but a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Jenna’ and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times that they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. Setting there on Angel’s Ravine looking out over into the Ravine just ahead of them Jenna’ then turned to Hector asking him

“Do you ever think that you was someone else’s before”

With a puzzled look on Hector’s face he then replied back to her saying 

“Someone Else’s! No! What kind of question is that? Jenna’ are you feeling okay!”

With smiling to him just as she said 

“It’s just! I really don’t know! It’s like I’m or was someone else, I can’t really explain it.”

With Hector giving a laugh as he said to her

“I don’t know what I would do with two Jenna’s All I know is how I feel about the Jenna’ that is here now, setting here beside of me.”

With Jenna’ then giving him a smile just she then placed her head his shoulder saying to him

“I don’t know what I would do another me either! I can barely handle myself at times”

With Hector placing his arms around Jenna’ before telling her

“I Don’t think I could handle another you either! laughing, I just know that I am holding the one Jenna’ that I want to be with.”

Giving each other a smile as they set there looking out into what could be there future ahead.

But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Jenna’ and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. 

The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Jenna’ trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Jenna’ then stopping to check on him as Hector’ then motioned to her saying to her

“Go! Go get ‘em Jenna! You got this!”

And with that it wasn’t too long before Jenna’ had caught up to them, for Jenna’ knew the trails like no other. 

Racing hard and fast to the finish side by side! Just as Jenna’ then gave him a look and smile to the outsider as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail! Leaving him setting there as Jenna’ had won the race.

Later that evening Jenna’ and Hector’ would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Jenna’ just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector’ then saying goodbye to Jenna’ as he then headed back to town leaving Jenna’ there for the night.

As she came to the ravine Jenna’ then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Jenna’ had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. 

Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Jenna’ began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? What was her childhood like? 

For as far back Jenna’’ could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Jenna’ would set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Jenna’ lay there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. lying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. 

The same dream the same dream that Jenna’ had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Jenna’ would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she had lived before! Before the town that she lived in now! But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone then called her Jenna’

Suddenly waking up to the morning’s light putting her hands up to her head Jenna’ just set there stunned. Thinking to herself

“Who was this other Jenna’ And why do I keep seeing her?”

Feeling how real the dream was for her, unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! 

Still visibly shaken as Jenna’ just sat there looking around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Jenna’ began to scream! A calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 “Hello Jenna’ it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Jenna’ as Jenna’ then replied saying to himself

“Then why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?” 

“I know all about you Jenna’ I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Jenna’ then replying 

“Answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Jenna’ your dreams.” 

As Jenna’ just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Jenna’ just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“It is you Jenna’ and it is not you”

More confused then ever Jenna’ just replied by saying 

“Me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Jenna’ standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.”

“But now in this Life you are her and she is not! and you are not. For her Life is her Life! For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Jenna’ then replying 

“Is this Heaven then and are you an Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Jenna’ And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Jenna’

 “The dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

“For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now! But look for what is to come!  for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!”

“Now go and Live your Life Jenna’ for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Jenna’ was now standing there looking out over Angels Ravine, Jenna’ couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then dreams of the girl was now slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come! Living a Life of whatever was to come for Jenna’

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now for it was her town her home. Her Life! With Jenna’ now leaving Angels Ravine, making her way back home, but as usual finding herself racing to beat her own best time.

Jenna’ was now making her way back into in Life, along with Hector by her side, riding through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. For she was now riding into Life! into her 

Life, Living a Life of what she made it. For that day! Jenna Ortega’ had found Grace

Tidying up the kitchen this morning and there's half a bottle of red wine sitting on my kitchen table that we had used for cooking over a week ago. My partner had a small glass here or there but it is definitely off by now. Just poured it down the drain while cleaning without a second thought. I had been walking past it sitting on the table for days without even recognizing that there was alcohol in my kitchen that would have been a huge temptation even a year ago.  

Just made me reflect on how far I've come. Old me would have spotted that as soon as I left the bedroom and entered the kitchen and I would have guzzled it down before I even made my morning coffee, regardless of how 'off' the wine was. I always used to want to build a home bar (I'm an ex-bartender) but could never keep anything on the shelf in my home. Even if I brought home some random shit like blue curacao or schnapps or vermouth I would just suck it all down. Now I didn't even register this random half-bottle of wine as something I could consume, it was just a cooking ingredient.

There's a system with about 50 HP 380/360 servers with redundant connections to two FC switches. Pretty much every few days any one of the servers will drop one, sometimes both connections. Physically pulling out the SFP and plugging it right back in (always on the server side!) resolves the issue. Restarting the server usually does the same. The local admin basically incorporated a daily walk through into his coffee break routine to check and replug the failed connections. But sometimes, even with redundancy, the failure of both comes at a very inopportune moment and then people get very annoyed. I need to also mention, that so far it hasn't been proven both SFPs fail simultaneously, we just notice when a server is not reachable at all as it has a knock on effect on a bunch of services.

Laser levels etc. all seem fine, (some) fiber cables have been checked and replaced to see if there's any difference etc. but so far no clear cause for any of this has been found. The only obvious thing that hasn't been tried yet, is replacing at least some of the SFPs with some other manufacturer/model. For reasons completely beyond me. I don't really know why, it's just not approved or something.

But then again, are these things really such junk to keep partially failing on a \~monthly basis?",2,1751552838.0,networking,14,0.75,False

I love cafe niloufer’s coffee and to me - it’s the best coffee I’ve ever had. Being said, I haven’t tried much other coffee in India but understand the flavor of niloufer is boasted from chicory.

I heard blue tokai coffee makes really good beans. Where can I buy these beans or taste them in person. I leave in few days, so shipping is the issue.

Are there any recommendations or advice someone can give me for any roasters to go to,  try some coffee, and buy some good quality beans?

Back in the US, I am going to invest into an espresso machine, so I want to ensure the beans I buy are worth it. Also, is there anywhere I can get a hand grinder for cheap. On blue tokai’s website I see they have one for 5,499 rupees.

Original Title: Is this FDIA?

Ok so my friend (45m) has a crazy baby mama, except I think she may really be crazy and I am worried about the kids. (Family services already involved so don’t rush to tell me to call police)

Mom(43f) is nasty dirty, her house just got condemned, filled with trash and piss soaked laundry, no working toilet no stove. Like a bad hoarders episode. She’s unemployed for the last 20yrs with undiagnosed mental illness. Unresolved trauma from her mother dying of cancer when she was 16-17. Won’t work, won’t clean. Just lays in bed depressed, consuming food and media.  Not on any medications, not on any drugs as far as we know.

This was a flipped switch from an active, happy go lucky girl who held a job for years. After having a kid it was like PPD set in and never left. And it got worse with each of 3 kids born (all biologically female). More so with the 3rd who had a serious heart condition and needed multiple surgeries. The attention was Glorious to mom but after finally leaving the hospital it was like a crash. She became very emotionally abusive and manipulative. Eventually my friend fled the abuse. He tried to get custody in the divorce but it’s a mothers first state.
Mom moved into one of her slumlord father’s shitty houses rent free, tells the state she uses her daughter’s social security disability check (for the heart condition) for rent in order to get food stamps.  After dad complains it’s getting kind of messy he is no longer allowed inside the house at pick ups and drop offs. Kids come back from mom’s smelly and in dirty clothes. ALL 3 often have accidents and wet the bed.

Now,for a bit more context.. 2 years later my friend remarried. New stepdaughter, and new son.
 So now there are 5 kids involved. Ages a bit intermixed.  We have daughter A (11), daughter B (9), stepdaughter (6) daughter C (3)[serious heart condition] and newborn son. Luckily all the kids get along great. However, with the birth of my friends son, mom’s mental health seems to have taken a sharp decline. 

First it was the “Baby Wearing” cult. Hippie moms with heirloom bespoke Tibetan cloth wraps to strap the baby to your body, meeting weekly at a chic-fil-a playplace to be snarky and trade and sell wraps and other wook nonsense. Maybe set up a playdate for the kids, maybe one for the parents too…
Those groups turned on each other pretty quick. Usually once all the money for $150 strips of cloth ran out.

Then it was “Unschooling” groups of moms (cast offs from the baby wearers) homeschooling the kids together. She pulled the kids out and started this. She loved this idea because she was homeschooled herself. After 2 different groups and a $100 online learning course there was absolutely nothing to show for it. My friend took her back to court but was denied custody again, but mom was ordered to have the kids attend public school.
So now mom has manipulated kids into believing dad is a monster trying to take them from her, and because he has rules about bedtimes and homework, there is no bedtime at moms, no rules and especially no homework.
Well mom didn’t really care about education so the kids failed 3 years in a row. How does a kid fail 1st grade?? Over 50 absences cuz mom can’t be bothered to get out of bed to send you doesn’t help much (I do not understand how truancy charges were never brought up).

Well back to court again…
This time mom doesn’t even bother to show up. Dad gets granted custody by default and he gets to have them for the school year, mom has them on weekends, the schedule reverses during summer months.
My friend was never trying to take the kids away out of spite but mom worked hard to villainize him to the kids. It was also about this time that daughter A began to use male pronouns and asked to be called a boys name.

Suddenly mom had a cause to champion, Trans rights became everything in her life (which only consisted of laying in bed and Facebook posting about how much of a supportive mother she was to her poor victimized son). And my friend was portrayed as not being accepting, except he was. Hell, he was raised by lesbians. This guy is about the most progressive person you could meet. A little weird, a little wild but really down to earth. And daughter A had always been a  tomboy so it wasn’t even hard to accept. But mom needed him to be the enemy. Household tensions rise.

Mom finds out my friend got a promotion so she petitions the court for more child support money.  (Why was she still getting child support and ssi check when my friend had primary placement??) but the judge rescinded the child support order entirely and told mom to get a job.  Of course this infuriates mom. Shortly afterward daughter B also begins wanting to use male pronouns but doesn’t want a new name, goes by their initials which are a common nickname anyway. This kid has always been very feminine and dainty so it seems quite odd behavior. But my friend goes along with it mostly because he doesn’t want to be the monster mom makes him out to be.

1st year back to school, all 3 struggle but they all pass. The next year all pass again with only the 2 elder daughter/sons having some struggle. Family drama is there but managable, the main issue when my friend tries to take over medical needs. See, mom still claims the kids to get food stamps and medicaid (how does she do that without primary placement?) and she flips out saying if he is handling school she is going to handle medical. Of course this also causes problems because he has them fully insured through his job so now they are double insured with that and medicaid and the bills keep kicking back unpaid by either. This is a headache that continues till today!

The following year is the Covid lockdown. The kids do fine with remote learning but once hybrid learning starts and they have to go back to school in person some days the kids go to moms for a weekend visit and she refuses to return them. Schools aren’t safe is her claim. 

Back to court again. Also around this time more concerns are raised about the state of mom’s home. Child Protection Services (CPS) are called to do a well ness check but mom refuses answer the door. CPS claims they can’t force their way in and nothing is done.
At court the judge says that the children over the age of 13 can decide for themselves to stay with mom but the younger daughter C must be returned for school. Mom promptly signs the elders out of school. That is the end of their education. A 9th grade high school drop out and a 7th grade middle school dropout. Mother knows best!

This is also the last my friend sees of his older children, except at thanksgiving (because they want a meal that mom won’t be preparing) and Xmas (they want gifts mom can’t afford with no job), always promising to visit more, never doing it. He is in their driveway twice a week for drop offs/pickups of daughter C and they have come outside maybe 2-3 times in the last 5 years to say hi, usually wanting something. All these teenage “boys” want to talk about is My Little Pony and trans rights. Now 22 and 19, they are uneducated, unemployed, unwashed and look like goth camshow workers, the only masculine thing about them are the acne and random patchy facial hairs from the hormone treatments. Mom is soooo proud of them.

Over this past year daughter C (now the dreaded age of 13, and has always been a super feminine girl who only last year still wanted to be a ballerina) started asking to use male pronouns as well, but still wanted to use their given name because the still feel kind of girly and wants to become a “Femboy” (pretty sure that’s a sexualized term typically used in pornography…).

This is where my post’s question comes in, but first let me tell you the events of this past 2 weeks…

Last week daughterson C has a routine cardiology appointment. Heart cath to see how growth is progressing. Guess they didn’t like what they saw and decided to put in a stent the same day. School is out so mom has the kid (and she refuses to let dad handle medical stuff anyway).  Fast forward to the weekend and my friend is told about this after the fact when mom txts him that medication doses have changed, bandage change schedule and  activity restriction for 2weeks. 

Over the weekend they go to the movies, the kid’s Aunt runs the movie theater and chats us up after the show. She flips out when she finds out about the medical stuff, she didn’t realize the heart problems were still a thing past infancy and tells him horror stories about the actual conditions of the house.
Living in piles of filth and laundry, no working toilet, they have a camp toilet that they scoop out with a coffee can, no stove, reeking of piss. She calls and makes a report with CPS. They come and interview my friend and daughterson C at his home and advise him to file for an emergency hearing/custody modification.

Yesterday…
My friend goes to court again, filing for an emergency hearing to change custody yet again.

The emergency hearing is denied! The court says there isn’t enough evidence that there is immediate danger, a case will be scheduled normally and to continue to follow the current custody order.

Meanwhile, CPS is finally able to get access to mom’s home as aunt is part of the trust that owns the house and has keys. The CPS worker won’t even walk through the house and says that daughterson C cannot be brought back to the house, it should be condemned, and they get evicted. The state will put them into a hotel until shelter can be arranged but they have to go get paychecks evals first. The adult children agree and are taken to the state service center but mom refuses to go and just goes back inside to lay on the filth covered bed.

So the kid is safe… for now…

So, could this be a case of Factitious disorder imposed on another (Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy)?  Is mom grooming her children to be trans so that she can be super supportive trans-rights momma and give her life meaning? Is there any hope for my friend and his children?",0,1751552708.0,AITAH,4,0.25,False

I am in quite a dilemma right now as I leave back to the US in a few days and have yet to find good coffee beans to take back home.

I love cafe niloufer’s coffee and to me - it’s the best coffee I’ve ever had. Being said, I haven’t tried much other coffee in India but understand the flavor of niloufer is boasted from chicory. 

I heard blue tokai coffee makes really good beans. Where can I buy these beans or taste them in person. I leave in few days, so shipping is the issue. 

Are there any recommendations or advice someone can give me for any roasters to go to,  try some coffee, and buy some good quality beans? 

Back in the US, I am going to invest into an espresso machine, so I want to ensure the beans I buy are worth it. Also, is there anywhere I can get a hand grinder for cheap. On blue tokai’s website I see they have one for 5,499 rupees.

Me and my partner went down from the apartment and took our dog ghost for a walk to the local coffee shop. 

As we hit a green at the zebra crossing and started walking, a very angry driver stomps his brakes in front of us and starts yelling at us to get out of the way. 

He then turned his steering wheel and planted it heading straight for ghost who was just next to me. We both jumped out of the way and I got angry and punched the back of his window as he drove past. 

He then stopped the car and jumped out to confront me but his car just kept going (it must have been an automatic and he left it in D and thought he put the handbrake on but he didn’t) 

So the car continued rolling and when he realised he started running to catch his car. He grabbed his door which was still open and he tripped chasing his car so there he was, just sliding across the concrete holding on to his car door. The car crashed into another parked car and he jumped back in his car immediately and drove off. 

While my partner was in shock from what just happened I had to let out a laugh because as a kid I played countless hours of gta and when you steal a car and someone hangs on to the door that’s exactly what it looked like just in real life so it was a little funny to me at the time. 

I don’t know if someone ever followed up with him after but it was nice to see instant karma in action.

1lqquvq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lqquvq,"Online Shopping: AMIRI, Chanel, Burberry and More – Let’s Talk Quality and Fit!","Hi, friends! As someone who is addicted to online shopping (I admit I’ve made a mistake), I couldn’t wait to share these pieces I recently found and analyze their hype and actual performance – plus, I want to hear your thoughts on their fit! Let’s get started:

1. AMIRI Black Tee 👕

\- Why I Chose It: Minimalism + streetwear vibe. That little logo on the chest? So understated yet so eye-catching.

\- Quality Check: Thick, heavyweight cotton that feels great without the cheap “see-through” feel. The oversized fit is perfect for that effortless “I woke up like this” look.

2. Loro Piana Suede Loafers 🥿

\- Luxe Feel: These shoes exude “quiet luxury”. The suede is silky soft and the stitching is impeccable.

\- Comfort Test: Whether you're wearing it for a work meeting or a dinner party, you'll feel like you're walking on clouds (even after 10,000 steps).

\- Cons: Suede = hard to maintain. Buy a protective spray - trust me.

3. Burberry Check Shorts 🩳

\- Classic Vitality: Burberry's iconic check never goes out of style. Lightweight nylon material = summer MVP.

\- Flexible Fit: Elastic waistband + drawstring = adjustable, suitable for any tummy-control occasion (pizza night? No problem).

\- Versatile Elements: Color-blocked check adds a fresh touch - this is not your grandpa's Burberry style.

4. Chanel Silver Sneakers 👟

\- Fashion Elements: Silver embellishment + double C logo = instant ""smart casual"" vitality.

\- Surprise: Super light! Mesh fabric ensures your feet can breathe - perfect for hot weather or going to the gym (like walking to the gym... and then having a smoothie).

\- Compliment magnet: Every time I wear these, someone asks, “Is this from Chanel?!”

5. Burberry Check Slides

\- Lazy-time pick: Comfortable enough for hours of Netflix watching, stylish enough to wear while sipping coffee.

\- Design highlights: The checkered laces complement the black sole—it’s effortlessly light and flexible.

\- Sizing suggestion: The sizing runs narrow—if you have wider feet, size up.

6. Polo Ralph Lauren White Polo 🏇

\- American classic: You can’t miss this in your wardrobe. Crisp white, sturdy fabric, and that iconic pony—it never goes out of style.

\- Versatile: Wear it with chinos at the office or shorts at a barbecue. Perfect for every occasion.

7. Goyard White Crossbody 🎒

\- Personality: Goyard’s monogram is white? Clean and neat. Holds phone, wallet and sunglasses - perfect for day trips.

\- Practical and flexible: adjustable strap (crossbody or one shoulder) + magnetic closure = easy to use, hard to steal.

\- Bought for my family

8. ESSENTIALS Grey Shorts 🏋️

\- Streetwear essential: soft and stretchy fleece - feels like a blanket (but cooler). Oversized fit = easy to breathe.

\- Understated logo: small logo on the leg says ""I know fashion"" without being too ostentatious.

\- Must-have: Workout, lazy homebody or tacos. Simply... a must-have.

Final Thoughts:

Most of the pieces exceeded my expectations - AMIRI t-shirt and Loro Piana loafers? Great value. Now it's your turn:

\- Which pieces did you love/hate?

\- What fit adjustments should I make?

\- What brands do I need to buy next?

Leave your thoughts in the comments - let's discuss fashion successes (and failures) together.

But I’m now looking to buy a house/condo, and simply can’t afford that in this absurdly wealthy neighborhood (which of course attributes to its beauty when you have resident that care deeply about their neighborhood).

16 years ago the west end was NOT where most people would want to be. I can tell it has improved in some areas, but what is it really like now for older (and single) corporate professionals? I’m thinking mostly between Broadway and Atwells due to the convenience of all the things I love, but are there better areas? Similar areas?

1lqqu5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1lqqu5r/modern_age_progress_is_a_caffeine_induced_mass/,Modern age progress is a caffeine induced mass psychosis,"In the last 300 years humans have made more technological and industrial progress than in the previous 10000+ years combined. What made these specific 300 years so special?

Sure, we can point to the Industrial Revolution as to what got the ball rolling. But there was something else that happened in the same era, something quieter..

**The mass popularization of caffeine.**

In the 17th century, coffee became a staple of daily life across Europe and beyond. It replaced beer and wine, which were the drinks of choice for centuries. People began starting their days alert, wired, ready to work. Suddenly, we had a society that could wake up early, show up on time, and crank out 12-hour factory shifts. People seem to ignore this historical fact. But I personally have an unwavering feeling that caffeine was in fact the hidden engine behind the immense progress we have made as a society.

**Ah yes, progress..**

The idolization of productivity, the stressed out urge to endlessly do things, just for the sake of being able to do even more things. Performance is our new God.  
How productive you are is how valuable you are to this society. It is the top priority that goes above all else - God, love, peace, health, connection. All of that is for whimps, so let us just chug another cup of coffee and think about how we can make more money and do more work. Caffeine has made our whole society manic, and everyone is sleeping on it. We need to stop our insane addiction, wake up, and realize that our blind obsession with “progress” is exactly what has pushed us to the edge of collapse. There has never been more loneliness, depression, confusion, and disconnection in human history than there is today. In my opinion, decaf is not just a personal choice towards health, but also a global necessity for building a new kind of world. God, love and human connection is what we’re truly desperate for - not more innovation, ""evolution"" and output.",20,1751552513.0,decaf,9,0.92,False
1lqqtol,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1lqqtol/what_makes_the_nespresso_pixie_espresso_machine_a/,What Makes the Nespresso Pixie Espresso Machine a Compact Coffee Powerhouse?,"There’s just something about starting my mornings with the aroma of a perfectly brewed cup of espresso. Testing the Nespresso EN127BL, I found myself excited every day to see just how well this compact espresso machine would transform my kitchen—and my caffeine levels. As someone who can't start the day without coffee, owning a machine like this felt like stepping into a barista's shoes, with surprising simplicity and efficiency.

**Design That Fits Like a Charm**

What struck me immediately was its sleek and industrial vibe. With its navy-blue coloring and hammered metal sides, this little machine looks like it belongs in a chic coffee shop rather than just sitting on my counter. It's small enough to tuck into tight spaces (4.6 inches wide—seriously, it's like a coffee ninja) and yet sturdy enough to feel well-built. Bonus points for the solid steel handle—it gives a satisfying heft to the whole experience. It definitely doesn’t feel cheap, which is something I appreciate after dealing with some flimsier options in the past.

**Effortless Brewing Options**

This espresso machine is straightforward, which I love—it’s as if they’ve designed it with drowsy, pre-coffee humans in mind. With just the press of a button, you can either get an Espresso or a Lungo. It’s limited to those two, but honestly, I think it’s perfect for anyone who doesn’t need complicated drinks. I prefer the robust punch of an espresso in the morning and a Lungo when craving something to sip longer. The semi-automatic operation makes it feel like I’m participating in the brewing process without being bogged down by too many settings.

**Pros**

- Compact size fits well in small kitchens.  
- High-pressure (19-bar!) extraction system ensures a rich and consistent coffee.  
- Energy-saving automatic shut-off after two minutes.  
- Aesthetic design matches modern and industrial environments alike.  

[Check Nespresso EN127BL price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b0djg16y9s/)

**Performance That Packs a Punch**

I have to say, I’ve tested coffee machines that make okay coffee and others that leave me stunned. This one edges closer to stunned. The high-pressure pump really brings out the flavors of the coffee capsules, meaning every aroma and note feels fully extracted. It heats up incredibly quickly—so much so that I barely had time to find my favorite coffee mug before it was ready. If mornings ever feel like a race against the clock, this petite powerhouse might just give you a head start.

**Is It Built for Everyone?**

While this is fantastic for capsule lovers, it doesn’t cater to those who prefer custom coffee grounds. Also, if you're someone who enjoys milk-based drinks like lattes or cappuccinos, you’re out of luck unless you purchase a separate milk frother. For me, though, it was enough to enjoy the simple yet bold cup it offers. Anyone who thrives on uncomplicated but quality espresso would find this a gem.

**Drawbacks**

- Limited to capsules and basic drinks.  
- Lacks an integrated milk frother for latte fans.  

**Product Rivals**

Looking at other capsule-based espresso machines, I’ve tried Keurig's single-serve brewers, which are undeniably versatile in beverage selection. However, they lack the same punchy espresso quality I noticed here, partly due to their lower pressure systems. Compared to Nespresso’s Vertuo line, this machine’s Original capsules are cheaper and easier to find but sacrifice variety like large-sized drinks. If compact design with a focus on espresso is a priority, though, this beats most challengers.

**Value for Money**

Price is often the trickiest part to gauge for espresso machines. This one sits at a sweet spot. It delivers consistent high-end performance while staying aesthetically pleasing. With its energy-saving modes and durable metal components, I’ve already felt some peace of mind that it’ll last longer than budget-friendlier models I’ve owned. Considering how much an upscale café charges for decent coffee, I’d dare say this machine might pay for itself quicker than I expected.

Hello everyone! **BigHedDjango** here, tunes for this week to help you out.

**All feedback on tunes is appreciated - good or bad. Specially when tunes are bad.** At the end of the day I am just the mechanic and you guys are the racers. Do not hesitate irrespective of your tuning knowledge or racing skills!

**Tuning method:**
1. **Stock look - stock wheel rims and size, no aero (unless absolutely necessary for handling and stability)**
2. Tuned for automatic/manual players by not skipping clutch+gearbox upgrades
3. Max performance with max handling possible
4. All cars **tuned vs. Unbeatable AI**, tracks/weather conditions are now unknown since time travel no longer works. Since release AI has been inconsistent between many car types and weather conditions, not every car will win 10/10 races vs Unbeatable AI without rewind/restart abuse
5. Bodykit used if it does not hurt performance

By Evelyn Harper","Rosalie Powell, the epitome of grace in the Blue Moon Pack, harbors a dangerous secret: her forbidden love for Castiel Gomez, the Alpha of the rival Shadow Fang Pack and her brother’s sworn enemy. Their clandestine affair is a delicate balance of passion and deception, but Rosalie’s world shatters when she overhears Castiel’s chilling revelation—their entire relationship was a calculated ploy to destroy her brother. As the truth unravels, Rosalie must confront the man she once trusted, her heart torn between betrayal and survival. With her brother’s legacy and her own future at stake, will Rosalie find the strength to escape Castiel’s web of lies, or will she become a pawn in his ruthless game of revenge?

# Chapter 1 - A Web of Deception and Betrayal

Rosalie Powell was the epitome of grace and poise within the prestigious Blue Moon Pack. The most scandalous secret she carried was her three-year clandestine relationship with Castiel Gomez, the Alpha of the rival Shadow Fang Pack and her brother’s sworn enemy. In the back of a sleek Rolls-Royce, he undressed her with practiced ease, leaving her exposed while he remained fully clothed, a phone discreetly placed nearby. His lips brushed her collarbone, sending shivers down her spine, leaving a trail of kisses that felt both tender and possessive.

""Castiel..."" she whispered, her voice trembling. ""Can we... skip the recording this time?""

Castiel paused, then chuckled softly, his dark eyes glinting with amusement. ""Shy? Don’t worry, it’s just for me. I want to watch it when I miss you, baby. Humor me, okay?""

Rosalie’s ears burned at the word ""baby,"" and she felt as though she was under a spell, unable to refuse him.

Castiel’s kisses descended again, this time with an intensity that slowly consumed her. The temperature in the car rose, and his movements became more fervent, as if he wanted to merge her into his very being. Rosalie’s breathing quickened, her fingers gripping his broad shoulders.

After what felt like an eternity, the car finally stilled. Rosalie, spent, sat atop him, drained of energy.

Castiel casually fastened his belt, glanced at her, and ruffled her hair. ""I’ve got a pack meeting later. The driver will take you home first, and I’ll join you later, okay?""

Rosalie nodded weakly. ""Alright.""

After Castiel left, Rosalie dressed herself, still dazed. As she was about to call the driver, she noticed Castiel’s wallet on the seat. She grabbed it, pushed the door open, and hurried after him.

After asking around, she found the private room where Castiel’s meeting was being held. The door was slightly ajar, and just as she was about to enter, she heard laughter from inside.

""Alpha Castiel, man, you’re making too much noise. When I came in, the whole Rolls-Royce was shaking. Can you imagine if Alpha Roman found out his sister was like that with you? He’d lose it!""

Rosalie’s mind went blank, frozen in place.

""Hahaha, Alpha Castiel and Alpha Roman have been at each other’s throats for years. The whole 'East Coast vs. West Coast' rivalry isn’t just for show. That’s why Alpha Castiel orchestrated that 'hero saves the damsel' act to win over Alpha Roman’s sister and make her fall for him.""

""How many years has it been? You’ve got to have hundreds of those videos by now, right? When are you planning to release them? I’d love to see the good girl stripped bare. And I can’t wait to see Alpha Roman’s face when he sees it!""

The group laughed heartily, unaware of Rosalie standing outside.

Rosalie’s mind spun, the words echoing louder and louder, threatening to shatter her.

Castiel... had he planned to save her from the start? Had their entire relationship been a ploy to get back at her brother?

""Alpha Castiel, why aren’t you saying anything? You only got close to Rosalie to mess with Alpha Roman, right? You didn’t actually fall for his sister, did you?""

""Fall for her?"" The man who had just called her ""baby"" sat at the head of the table, lazily sipping whiskey. His lips curled into a sneer. ""Alpha Roman is my enemy. I just want to destroy him. I’m thinking about when to release those videos. Maybe on Rosalie’s birthday. Alpha Roman’s expression will be priceless.""

""Alpha Castiel, you’re a legend!""

The group erupted into laughter, their voices filled with anticipation.

Rosalie’s hands trembled, barely able to stand. A waiter’s voice broke through her thoughts. ""Miss, why aren’t you going in?""

Rosalie snapped back to reality and handed the wallet to the waiter. ""I... I’m not going in. Please give this to Alpha Castiel. Tell him it was found, but don’t mention I was here.""

With that, she turned and ran, tears streaming down her face as the cold words echoed: ""Alpha Roman is my enemy. I just want to destroy him.""

Her heart felt crushed, the pain so intense she could barely breathe.

Their entire relationship had been a calculated move from the start.

Years ago, Rosalie had defied her brother and moved to Chicago to attend one of the best dance schools in the country. After graduation, she decided to stay in Chicago, despite her brother’s pleas to return to New York. Her parents doted on her, and her brother was fiercely protective, but she wanted to make a name for herself.

Her heart had been devoted to dance until she met Castiel Gomez, her brother’s sworn enemy. The two had been locked in a bitter rivalry for years, battling over territory and resources, their hatred seemingly unending.

And yet, it was this man who had saved her twice.

The first time, she had been hit by a car, and the driver fled. No one wanted to get involved, leaving her bleeding and calling for help. It was Castiel who had driven by in his Rolls-Royce, scooped her up, and carried her to safety like a guardian angel.

The second time, she had been drugged and nearly assaulted, and once again, it was Castiel who had rescued her, taking her away and becoming her savior that night.

The next morning, she had woken to find him by the window, buttoning his shirt. Hearing her stir, he turned, his mesmerizing eyes locking onto hers.

He leaned down, slowly approaching her. ""I’ve been wanting to ask you since the first time I saw you, little girl. Do you like me?""

Her mind went blank as she stared at his impossibly handsome face, stammering incoherently. He smirked. ""No? Then why do you blush every time you see me? And why did you kiss me this morning? I thought the drugs had worn off.""

She was so embarrassed she wanted to run, but he pulled her back, his lips capturing hers in a gentle kiss.

From that day on, they were together.

For three years, she had believed their love was mutual, dreaming of the day they would return to New York together, where she could help mend the rift between her brother and Castiel. Now, she realized how foolish she had been.

She didn’t know how long she had been running, but the rain began to fall on her face, and her phone rang. It was her brother.

""Rosalie, I’ve opened the biggest dance studio in New York for you, and I’ve found you a mate. Please break up with whoever you’re seeing now. You know how much I and our parents want you to stay close, to be with us in New York...""

As soon as she heard his familiar voice, Rosalie’s tears burst forth uncontrollably.

She took a deep breath, trying to steady her voice. ""I’m sorry, Alpha Roman. I’ve worried you all these years. I’ll come back to New York, and I’ll meet the mate you’ve chosen for me.""

# Chapter 2 - The Weight of Leaving

On the other end of the line, Alpha Roman Powell’s voice carried a hint of disbelief. ""Rosalie, are you really willing to come back? And meet the mate I’ve chosen for you? What about that Alpha you were so crazy about?""

Rosalie’s voice was soft, barely above a whisper. ""I don’t love him anymore. I never will again.""

After a moment of joy, Roman’s tone immediately turned cold, his Alpha instincts sharp. ""Did he hurt you?""

Rosalie’s mind flashed with the harsh words, the videos Alpha Castiel Gomez had casually mentioned, and his icy voice. The pain was searing, but she had to stay composed.

Her brother, the Alpha of the Blue Moon Pack, had always protected her since they were pups. If he knew the truth, he’d probably storm straight to Chicago, challenging Alpha Castiel to a fight that could escalate into a full-blown pack war.

She couldn’t let him worry anymore. She had to handle this mess herself.

""No, Alpha Roman,"" she forced herself to stay calm, her voice steady despite the turmoil inside. ""I’ll come back as soon as I’ve sorted things out here.""

After a few more words of reassurance, Roman reluctantly hung up, and Rosalie returned to the penthouse she shared with Alpha Castiel.

She headed straight to the bathroom, washing away the day’s weariness before walking to the coffee table. She pulled out a blank sheet of paper and started making a list.

Her pen scrawled a few lines:

Throw things away, pack, quit her job, say goodbye to friends, delete the videos.

These were all the things she needed to take care of before leaving.

Her gaze lingered on the last item, her fingers trembling slightly.

Thinking of the birthday plans she’d overheard at the pack meeting, she knew she had to leave before that day.

With that in mind, she picked up the calendar on the table and circled the date with a red pen.

""Marking it like that, afraid I’d forget?""

The sound of the penthouse door opening came from behind her, and Alpha Castiel’s voice, laced with a lazy smile, suddenly filled the room. Rosalie’s hand froze, the pen leaving a long streak on the paper.

She turned to see Alpha Castiel leaning against the doorframe, a suit jacket slung over his arm, his shirt collar slightly open, revealing a glimpse of his collarbone. His presence was commanding, as always, his Alpha aura filling the space effortlessly.

His eyes fell on the calendar in her hand, and the corner of his lips curved upward. ""How could I forget my Luna’s birthday? I’ve got a big surprise planned for you that day.""

Rosalie’s fingers tightened around the pen. She looked up, meeting his dark, piercing eyes, and forced a smile. ""I’ve got a big surprise for you too.""

Alpha Castiel paused, then chuckled, his voice deep and smooth. ""Your birthday, and you’re planning a surprise for me?""

He walked over to her, reaching out to tousle her hair, his tone affectionate but laced with that Alpha dominance that always made her heart skip a beat. ""But, on your birthday, did you invite your brother?""

Rosalie’s heart skipped a beat, her fingers unconsciously gripping the edge of the table.

She looked up, feigning calm. ""Do you want me to?""

Alpha Castiel looked down at her, a complex emotion flickering in his eyes. He smiled, his voice low and deliberate. ""Invite him. It’s time to bury the hatchet. I’ve been at odds with your brother for so long, and I don’t want to admit defeat, but who made me fall for his precious sister? Bowing to love isn’t something to be ashamed of.""

Rosalie’s throat felt like it was blocked, and she couldn’t say a word.

Alpha Castiel leaned in to kiss her, but she turned her head away, whispering, ""I’m not feeling well today. Let’s not.""

Alpha Castiel’s movement paused, then he let out a soft laugh, kissing her forehead instead. ""Alright, get some rest early.""

With that, he turned and headed into the bathroom.

Rosalie stood there, listening to the sound of running water, her fingers gripping the table tightly.

Her eyes fell on Alpha Castiel’s phone, carelessly tossed on the couch, her heart pounding as if it might burst out of her chest.

She quietly picked up the phone, trying several passcodes, but none worked.

Her fingers trembled slightly, a sense of helplessness washing over her.

In the end, she could only place the phone back where it was, forcing herself to stay calm and figure out another way.

The next morning, when Alpha Castiel woke up, he found Rosalie packing.

At her feet were piles of their couple items—matching mugs, slippers, throw pillows…

Alpha Castiel frowned, walking over to her, his tone laced with confusion. ""Why are you suddenly throwing all this away?""

Rosalie didn’t look up, her voice flat. ""I don’t like them anymore. I’ll buy new ones later.""

Alpha Castiel didn’t press further, just smiled, his Alpha aura softening slightly. ""Don’t bother. I’ll have the maid take care of it. It’s almost time—should I drive you to the dance studio?""

Rosalie shook her head. ""No need. I’ve already called to quit.""

Alpha Castiel paused, his brow furrowing slightly. ""But you loved dancing. Why quit suddenly?""

Rosalie looked up, her gaze steady. ""I’m tired. I want to take a break.""

Alpha Castiel was silent for a few seconds, then reached out to ruffle her hair, his touch gentle but still carrying that Alpha authority. ""Quitting is fine. Dancing is exhausting, and…""

His fingers lightly traced her waist, his voice low and possessive. ""I don’t want anyone else seeing how soft my Luna’s waist is.""

Rosalie dodged his touch, her tone cool. ""You should get going.""

After Alpha Castiel left, Rosalie spent most of the day finally getting rid of all the couple items.

Standing in the now-empty living room, her heart felt heavy, as if something was lodged in her chest, making it hard to breathe.

Just then, her phone buzzed.

She picked it up and saw a message from an unknown number.

""Meet me at Blue Mountain Café at 3 PM. I’m Alpha Castiel Gomez’s chosen mate.""

Rosalie’s fingers clenched around the phone, her knuckles turning white.

# Chapter 3 - A Clash of Hearts and Ice

Rosalie Powell pushed open the café door, the wind chime softly tinkling behind her. Her gaze swept the room, quickly landing on a woman seated in the corner.

The woman was dressed in a flawlessly tailored Chanel suit, her makeup impeccable, radiating an air of natural superiority. Rosalie walked over, pulled out a chair, and sat down, her expression calm and unreadable.

""My name is Kendall Moore, Alpha Castiel Gomez's chosen mate,"" Kendall said bluntly, a hint of challenge in her tone.

Rosalie didn’t respond, simply looking at her with eyes as still as a frozen lake.

Kendall, clearly not expecting this reaction, frowned. ""You’re Alpha Castiel’s Luna, and suddenly I appear as his chosen mate. Don’t you have any questions?""

Rosalie’s lips curled slightly, her heart cold and numb.

Questions? What could she possibly ask? Ever since she overheard those words at the pack meeting, she had been completely disillusioned with Alpha Castiel.

Nothing he did could surprise her anymore.

Seeing her silence, Kendall’s expression darkened.

She had revealed her identity expecting Rosalie to break down, to scream and cry, but this girl was like ice, leaving her with no leverage.

She gritted her teeth, her tone sharpening. ""The Shadow Fang and Moonlight Packs will soon be united through a mate bond, and Alpha Castiel has agreed. No matter what your status is, he’ll reject you immediately. So I suggest you leave on your own accord. I might even give you some money. Otherwise, you’ll only embarrass yourself.""

Rosalie lifted her gaze, her eyes calm. ""When will the announcement of your mate bond be made?""

Kendall was taken aback but then smiled smugly. ""Early next month. The exact date hasn’t been set yet, but it won’t be long.""

Early next month—right after her birthday.

So, Alpha Castiel had planned it all along. Release the video on her birthday, reject her, and then form a mate bond with the Moonlight Pack.

Alpha Castiel Gomez, you truly have no heart.

Rosalie’s voice was soft. ""Did you investigate me? If you had, you’d know I’m not short on money. If you came here today to humiliate me, you’ve miscalculated.""

Kendall’s face turned pale. Rosalie glanced at her and added, ""And let me remind you, Alpha Castiel has no heart. He doesn’t love anyone but himself. A mate bond of convenience is fine, but if you fall for him, you’re doomed.""

With that, she stood up to leave, but Kendall suddenly grabbed her wrist, her voice shrill. ""How dare you say that about him?!""

Before Rosalie could react, Kendall grabbed the coffee from the table and flung it at her.

The warm liquid dripped down her hair and face, staining her clothes.

Kendall, still not satisfied, shoved Rosalie to the ground.

Her back hit the corner of the table, and she fell hard, her head striking the floor. A sharp pain shot through her, and her vision blurred. She reached up to touch her forehead, her fingers coming away bloody.

At that moment, the café door was flung open.

""Kendall, what are you doing?!""

A cold voice rang out, filled with suppressed anger.

Rosalie looked up to see Alpha Castiel striding in, followed by a few of his pack members. He was dressed in a black trench coat, his Alpha aura dark and terrifying.

He pushed Kendall aside, grabbed another cup of coffee from the table, and without hesitation, threw it at her.

Then he took off his coat and wrapped it around Rosalie, his voice trembling slightly. ""Rosalie, are you okay?""

Kendall stared at him in disbelief. ""Alpha Castiel, I’m your chosen mate! You’re doing this for her?!""

# Chapter 4 - A Shattered Trust and Broken Promises

Castiel ignored Kendall, his gaze fixed on Rosalie with a tenderness that felt almost surreal. ""Sweetheart, wait for me in the car. I’ll handle this and be right there.""

Rosalie didn’t respond, allowing him to help her to her feet as she walked numbly toward the door. Her mind was blank, her ears ringing, and it wasn’t until she sat in the car that she began to regain her senses.

Not long after, Castiel’s brothers emerged from the café. One of them approached the car and tapped on the window.

""Rosalie, don’t get the wrong idea. This mate bond was arranged by the Lycan King to strengthen the alliance between the Shadow Fang Pack and the Moonlight Pack. Alpha Castiel didn’t tell you because he wanted to handle it himself. He never expected Kendall to come and provoke you like this. He loves you—he would never be with anyone else.""

Loves her?

She found it laughable, but her face remained expressionless, her eyes downcast as she sat silently, like a lifeless statue.

After a while, Castiel came out, and Kendall ran off in tears, her figure disheveled. Castiel dismissed his brothers and got into the car, gently tending to Rosalie’s wounds.

His movements were delicate, as if handling a fragile treasure, his voice low and hoarse. ""Rosalie, the mate bond was arranged by the Lycan King. I won’t mark her, and I’ll make it clear to them soon. Don’t overthink it.""

Rosalie didn’t respond, her gaze fixed ahead as she said flatly, ""I understand, Alpha Castiel. Let’s go.""

Castiel glanced at her, hesitating as if he wanted to say more, but he started the car instead.

The atmosphere inside was suffocating. Rosalie closed her eyes, her mind in turmoil.

Suddenly, a screech of brakes pierced the air.

Rosalie’s eyes snapped open just in time to see a truck barreling toward them.

Her pupils dilated in shock, and in the next moment, Castiel threw himself over her, shielding her with his body.

""Boom—""

The world spun violently.

Rosalie passed out in a pool of blood.

When she woke again, she was lying in a hospital bed, the harsh fluorescent light above stinging her eyes.

Castiel sat by her side, his face pale but his eyes filled with relief. ""Rosalie, you’re finally awake. You scared me to death.""

Rosalie moved her lips, her voice hoarse. ""How badly are you hurt?""

Castiel ruffled her hair, his tone light. ""Just a broken bone. It’s nothing. I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you better.""

He stood up quickly. ""Stay still. I’ll call the healer to check on you.""

After he left, Rosalie’s phone buzzed.

She picked it up and saw a video sent by Kendall.

The footage showed the scene from the café earlier.

In the café, Castiel’s brothers were talking over each other:

""Kendall, how many times do we have to say it? Alpha Castiel’s relationship with Rosalie is part of a plan. He’s pretending to love her to get back at Alpha Roman, his rival. Since the mate bond between our packs is already arranged, he’ll definitely mark you. You know he never breaks his word in pack matters. Don’t ruin this, please.""

But Kendall only looked at Castiel, her voice trembling. ""Alpha Castiel, is it true? Do you really not love Rosalie at all? Is it all just revenge?""

The brothers chimed in: ""Of course! How could he fall for his rival’s sister? That’s not Alpha Castiel’s style. If he really fell for her, it wouldn’t be Alpha Castiel humiliating Alpha Roman—it’d be Alpha Roman trampling Alpha Castiel. I can’t even imagine that.""

""I want to hear it from Alpha Castiel!"" Kendall stared at him, her eyes red. ""Alpha Castiel, tell me.""

Castiel’s expression was complicated, his gaze drifting toward the car where Rosalie sat.

Finally, he nodded.

Kendall threw herself into his arms, her voice choked with tears. ""But I still don’t feel secure. We’re about to mark each other, yet you’re still acting with another she-wolf. If you really mean it, pretend the brakes fail and steer the car toward the passenger side. Make Rosalie get into an accident, and I’ll believe you. Okay?""

Castiel was silent for a moment before he whispered, ""Okay.""

The video ended abruptly.

Some additional context:

I've been brewing coffee in my moka pot for the last two years, mastering the technique, but I've always wanted to get some good espresso, as the local coffee shops in my area are a terrible hit or miss (mostly miss).  
I've found a deal mentioned in the title although there are some caveats:  
\- it's used and not tested by the seller. The buttons light up, the electronics work and theoretically everything should be fine and they do offer a 14-day no questions asked return policy.  
\- I've got no experience with espresso machines and don't know what problems i should potentially expect from a used one.

Regarding the grinder, which some people complain about - I know you can adjust them so that it grinds finer, that should work, right? Also, I do have a TimeMore C3ESP PRO I use with my moka. No clue whether it should be better than the built in one.",1,1751552393.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Ever look at your Monday morning coffee and think, **“There has to be more to life than this 9-to-5 grind?”** Same. I used to be chained to my desk, feeling like I was missing out on something bigger. Trust me, I know I’m not alone in dreaming of more freedom, right?

Let’s dive into something we’ve all been hearing about lately: AI tools. These little tech wonders aren’t just for tech wizards — they can be your best friend, too! Imagine making bank while sipping on your favorite latte at a cozy café instead of staring at a screen in a cubicle. Sounds dreamy? Let’s talk about how to make it a reality!

Here’s the lowdown on some killer ways to leverage AI and ditch that grind:

**1. Find Your Niche**  
   - Do you have a hobby or passion? AI tools can help you transform it into a side hustle! Whether it’s digital art, writing, or even coding, find something you love.  
   - Example: I know someone who turned his love for cooking into a food blog that now takes him around the world! 🌍

**2. Automate the Boring Stuff**  
   - Think social media management, email responses, and even content creation. There are AI tools that can take care of these tasks, leaving you more time to focus on what you love.  
   - Want to churn out blog posts without losing sleep over it? Tools like ChatGPT can help structure your ideas in no time. 

**3. Collaborate with AI**  
   - Treat AI as a partner, not a replacement! Use it to brainstorm ideas, research, or even come up with catchy titles. The collaboration can spark creativity in ways you’ve never imagined.  
   - What’s more fun than throwing out random ideas and watching AI shape them into cool concepts?

**4. Learn & Adapt**  
   - Stay curious! The tech world is evolving fast — new tools pop up all the time that can supercharge your work. Keeping your skills sharp can really pay off!
   - Join communities or forums (like this one!) where you can share tips, tricks, or even your latest finds. Learn from each other!

**5. Monetize Your Skills**  
   - Once you’ve got your groove, think about platforms to sell your creations. From Etsy to Patreon to online courses — there are tons of ways to turn your passion into profit!  
   - Picture this: your art selling while you’re catching up on your favorite show. 🎨🍿

But here’s the kicker: **Before it’s too late**, you gotta seize the moment! The digital landscape is morphing every day, and the earlier you hop on the AI train, the better. Feels like being part of something big, doesn’t it?

So, what’s stopping you? Fear of failing? Imposter syndrome? Just remember, every pro was once an amateur. 

Let’s chat! Share your thoughts on which AI tools you’re excited to explore or any success stories you’ve experienced. Who knows, your story might inspire someone else to take the plunge!",1,1751552297.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1lqqqvs,https://i.redd.it/1lt4you54oaf1.png,Basement bar menu (version 2) & a simplified Black Yukon Sucker Punch recipe from Twin Peaks,"Text recipe for the rules:

**Black Yukon Sucker Punch**

This is a simplified version of a drink found in an episode of Twin Peaks. [Here's another post I made about it in a different sub with a picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1lolyp5/my_take_on_a_black_yukon_sucker_punch/). In the show, it's half dark liquid and half blue foam in a highball glass, and a character says that it ""sneaks up on ya"". [Others before me have figured out how to make the drink in a true-to-show way, using the ingredients shown in the scene and the sound of the blender off screen, etc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6Z78zIGFD4). I wanted to make one using an egg white alternative, so I made this version to fit in a cocktail glass to get that 50% foam look with less volume. I think it's more drinkable this way because you don't have to get through three eggs worth of foam to reach your drink. Anyway, here's the recipe:

\- Shake ice, 1.5 oz whiskey, .75 oz cold brew concentrate, and \~10 dashes egg white alternative (or an egg white; I'm just lazy) for a nice thick foam. You could use Yukon Jack honey whiskey to make this cocktail more true to its name.

\- Strain into a coupe or other cocktail glass.

\- Gently stir in 1 drop of blue food coloring into the foam.

\- Garnish with a slice of cherry pie on the side.

\------

I shared the first version of this menu here a few days ago and got good feedback. Here's version 2. I addressed a few of the suggestions, namely the design, by taking out descriptions of the classics as someone suggested. I also decreased the font size of the descriptions. These changes helped create more space and made the menu more readable. I'm not sure everybody I hang out with knows what a Tom Collins is without a description, but I'll cross that bridge later.

Someone said the simple syrup in the aperol & soda was too much. I made one in the middle of my workday to find out and then remembered I don't like Aperol... I bought it so I could make Zaderades (aka Spaghetts or Low Lifes), which my friends love and specifically requested. I'll do further testing on this over the weekend with friends who enjoy the taste. A few people recommended switching to an Aperol Spritz and adding a Hugo Spritz, which is a great idea, but I will have issues saving the leftover sparkling wine.

For anyone who missed part one, I am focusing on things with long shelf lives and trying to minimize ingredients because I currently have too many bottles at the bar. Anything I'm actively trying to get rid of is ""on special"". If you have ideas about how to get rid of Goldshlager other than pushing shots on people, please let me know...",0,1751552288.0,cocktails,2,0.4,False

Dear Agent,

Seventeen-year-old Draven Vale never asked to be brought back to life. He never asked to be a detective for Death. But drowning in a lake seemed a poor alternative to Death’s blood-inked deal: in exchange for his life, Draven must solve classmate Julian Mallory’s murder within one year. 

Now, autumn has returned. Draven’s deadline is a month away. Fueled only by coffee and desperation, Draven is running out of leads and red thread for his stringboard. But when a ouija board séance goes wrong, Julian possesses Draven’s body. The boys are forced into a begrudging detective partnership. 

Julian is everything Draven isn’t: tender, justice-driven, and bizarrely *alive* for a half-dead boy. Naturally, the two clash almost as often as they cooperate. Their bickering-filled investigation leads them to Blair Hubbel—Julian’s charming ex and Draven’s prime suspect—who heads a secret society that bottles and drinks the memories of ghosts. To make matters worse, Death is now hungry not only for Julian’s killer, but for Julian and the bottled memories too.

As Blair’s true motives unravel and Julian’s repressed memories surface, Draven must make a choice: protect his own life, or risk it to defend the dead. Unwilling to lose his bond with Julian, Draven must abandon nihilism and fight for the fragile, everyday memories that everyone else, even Death, would rather consume or forget.

THE ARCHIVE OF INK is a YA dark academia novel complete at 92,000 words. It blends the prickly, intimate voice of Naomi Novik’s A DEADLY EDUCATION with the heart and humor of Aiden Thomas’ CEMETERY BOYS. \[personalization\]

**First 300** (Starts with a tape recording from Death to Draven! These recordings are interspersed throughout the novel):

***Recording Date: November 1st, 1981***

***Speaker: Death***

*Can you hear me? Is this old thing even rolling? Ehem, yes, well. I suppose there’s no easy way to say this, so here it is. You died. You were dead. The ashes to ashes, dust to dust, six feet under kind of dead. The kind of dead you can’t reverse.* 

*Trust me, I know what you’re thinking: how could you have died, when you’re living and breathing and listening to this tape right now? I don’t blame you if you’ve forgotten. Memories are spongy things, and they always take a while to soak back in—especially the ones we’d rather forget. Still, I won’t make you wait to hear from me. I know you humans hate eating up that sugared little thing you call time. So keep listening, my dear medium, and keep living. I’ll try to make this short and sweet.*

*You and I made a deal.* 

*A* deal...

*Hmph. You’ll have to forgive me—the word tastes unfamiliar on my tongue. I can’t remember the last time I made one. You are...a special case. When I heard you take your last breath, I knew this to be true. When I felt your vision fade, I saw so clearly the future you had with me. All it took was a scrap of parchment and bloodied ink, and just like that, the deal was done.*

*The exact details of our agreement aren’t important. You’ll remember it all soon enough. For now, there’s only one thing you need to understand.*

*You are alive because* I *allow it.* 

*Not fate, not god.* Me.

*I don’t make deals like this lightly. If you fail, I will reclaim you. And rest assured, I will savor the taste of your flesh.*

*You have one year to solve the case. Stay in touch, and happy haunting.*

*Death, signing out.*",6,1751552255.0,PubTips,5,0.88,False

Hey everyone. I’ve tried this before and it seems to die out every time. If you’ve messaged me before and our conversation faded out - feel free to hit me up again. 

Like many of you, I am a married, dad looking for connection with other guys - something I have lost as I have gotten older. I was told early in my career the way to succeed was to be willing to move to accept promotions. Well, it was fun while it lasted but in the end I ended up getting fired from that job and moved away from essentially every friend I ever had. I still have a few guys I keep in touch with on occasion but it’s just not the same anymore. 

I have plenty of acquaintances. People I see regularly but have limited interaction with. I’d consider some of my coworkers casual friends, but because they are co-workers there is a natural professionalism barrier I think at times that prevents us from getting too close. What I’m aiming for is someone who would develop into a close friend. A friend to share personal thoughts, feelings, and experiences with. Ideally someone in real life, but I’d take a good online friend too. This stage often takes several months to a couple of years to develop. It’s also extra difficult for us as married dads. The spare time we have is laughable. But I am the type of person who is willing to make time for important stuff.

A little about my interests: I am drawn to outdoor type activities. I workout regularly; although not super serious about it. I enjoy running and swimming. The nerdry side of me likes web development. Not a video gamer though. However, I do enjoy word games and puzzles. I like doing handyman type projects around the house until they take too long and it starts to feel like work. I operate on black coffee. While I don’t judge at all - I am just not drawn naturally to people who use drugs, vape, etc. Lean democrat/liberal but really probably more of a moderate. 

If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to connect! FYI - if I get more than one or two adds, I may hold off on adding you back until I can focus on chatting with you. #FL",1,1751552223.0,NextBestBro,0,1.0,False
