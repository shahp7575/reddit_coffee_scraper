The afternoon she vanished, she clocked out at around 3pm and told her coworkers she was headed to a party at Bakers Beach.

She was last seen withdrawing money from a Wells Fargo ATM on the second floor of the Crocker Galleria Mall with a blonde woman. 

A Bay Guardian Newspaper was found stuffed in her trash can with a personal ad circled which read: : ""FRIENDS: Female seeking friends to share activities, who enjoy music, photography, working out, walks, coffee, or simply the beach, exploring the Bay area! Interested, call me.""

The Process We Followed (Step-by-Step)1.
 Perfect 22-minute multi-cam sitcom = ~3,000 words (~140 wpm spoken).

Structure: 
Classic Frasier formula—Teaser (400w), Act 1 (800w), Act 2 (1,000w peak chaos), Act 3 (600w resolve), Tag (200w punch).

### Turning a Lucky Break into a Repeatable Process

**Reliability: ★★★★★ Very High**

### What This Trick Actually Does

When a prompt finally clicks, **save it immediately** - don't assume you will remember the magic formula. You need to capture the settings right then and there because:

- Replicating a ""vibe"" from scratch is nearly impossible.
- Getting ""close enough"" is much easier with a template.
- Your memory will definitely fail you by tomorrow.

---

### How to Save

1. Once you nail a style that works, stop and save.
2. Hit the **""book"" icon** next to the Style Box.
3. Give it a name you will actually recognize later.
4. Pull it up whenever you need that specific sound.

---

### Example Presets

**""80s Synthwave""**
```
80s Synthwave, nostalgic neon vibes, analog synths, gated reverb drums, retro futuristic, (108-118 BPM), driving bass, arpeggiated synths, cinematic, cold wave influence, nocturnal atmosphere
```

**""Dark Berlin Techno""**
```
Dark techno, minimal and hypnotic, (128-135 BPM), driving relentless bass, industrial atmosphere, underground Berlin club, sparse arrangement, menacing groove, analog machine sounds
```

**""Acoustic Coffeehouse""**
```
Acoustic indie folk, warm male vocals, fingerpicked guitar, intimate setting, coffee shop vibe, (90-100 BPM), storytelling, organic and natural, gentle reverb
```

---

### When This Fails

This only falls apart if:
- You trust your brain to remember the prompt (don't).
- You tell yourself you'll ""just recreate it later"" (it never sounds the same).
- You wait too long to hit save after a win.

---

### Iteration Advice

- **Save the MOMENT something works:** strike while the iron is hot
- **Keep it organized:** tag them by Genre, Mood, Use Case, or even the specific project name
- **Build a library:** a custom library of presets is what eventually defines your unique sound
- **Update presets:** don't be afraid to tweak and re-save a preset as you refine it

### Extra Tips

The ""Secret Sauce"" (seeds): wile a preset saves the style, the seed number is what defines the actual ""DNA"" of that specific generation. Unfortunately, Suno still doesn't allow users to manually save and replicate an exact seed number. This makes your Style Presets even more important - they are the only reliable way to stay in the same sonic ballpark.

The Library Trap: you can technically go back into your Suno library, find an old song, and copy the prompt/style from the ""More"" (three dots) menu. But don't rely on this. Once you hit a few months of heavy use, you will have thousands of generations to sift through. Finding that ""one specific synth lead"" from three months ago in a sea of nameless tracks is a nightmare. Save the preset now to save your sanity later.

I decided to try a prolonged fast based on the great results of another poster here, and on a study I’d read regarding fasting as a protocol for LC. It was not my first time fasting- I’ve done several 3 day fasts in the past- but it was my first extended 5 day fast.

 I contracted Covid in June and was diagnosed with LC in Aug/Sept from 3 different docs. I also had a partial collapsed lung from the ordeal. Prior to LC, I competed in bodybuilding, ran a personal training and nutrition company and was planning to compete in powerlifting. I was a picture of health, even in my late 40s, and my primary doc placed my bio age at early 30s. After Covid, I developed Hashimoto’s, severe fatigue, reactivated Epstein Barr virus, PEM, a lacy full body rash, painful vascular issues, a terrible sensation of pressure at the top of my head and temples, insomnia and depression (obv). 

Supplements, a strict keto diet, quitting the gym and constant rest have helped my symptoms a lot. I was also placed on a Valtrex/Celebrex combo treatment for reactivated EBV. But, I was still struggling with the terrible head pressure, vascular problems, and a weird tremor in my legs and calves, as well as brain fog and fatigue.

Fasting for 5 days was not as hard as I thought it would be, simply because I’m desperate to get better. 

Well, it’s been a week since the fast ended, and I’m happy to report that the head pressure is GONE, as well as the internal tremors. My fatigue and brain fog is also much better. I still have the rash when it gets cold, but vascular symptoms have improved a lot overall. I also feel less depressed, maybe because there’s light at the end of the tunnel now. 

I haven’t tried to exercise yet- too scared still because of the debilitating crashes I had before- but if things stay as is, I will try a very short session next week.

My plan with fasting is to do once a week 24 hour fasts, and then a 5 day fast every other month, and of course, to stay on keto which has also really helped. This protocol will trigger the various stages of autophagy and continue reducing inflammation.

No alarm, even the Sonic Bomb Dual Extra Loud Alarm Clock with Bed Shaker, didn't do the trick.

I am a work from home software developer working remotely for a company in a different timezone (-2 hours) so I start work at 11am local time (but end at 8pm - night). I still couldn't wake up by 11am. I used to go to bed around 3-4am every day.

I was always late to work, full of anxiety previous night to not miss morning meetings, etc. you know how it is. On weekends I would wake up even later around 1-3pm and basically lose half of it sleeping. Ironically, I love mornings, I am in Greece and we usually have very nice warm sunny mornings.

In end of October, I was accommodating a friend who sleeps around 11pm-1am and wakes up at 7-8am due to his work schedule. I would wake up with him as we were in the same room. This went on for 2 weeks. I got used to this sleeping-waking up schedule quickly.

Since November, I now wake up everyday (including weekends), very naturally and easily at 8-9 am, sometimes even before the alarm rings.

What I changed:  
\- Get to bed earlier, around 1-2am, 3am max consistently, even on weekend nights.  
\- (1\*) Bought a new espresso machine...(I am a coffee lover)  
\- (2\*) I started learning a sport (tennis) and have lessons at 10am once a week.

What I believe actually happened:  
Because of (1\*) and (2\*) I am actually **eager** to get off bed every day, so I can enjoy a nice cup of coffee and relax for 2 hours enjoy the sunshine and silence before going to work/tennis, it's my own personal time in a way that nobody interrupts or messages or anything, just peace. Also I have more time for my ""body"" and ""mind"" to ""wake up"" and prepare to deal with the daily tasks/stress.

In the past I didn't want to get out off bed because I hated waking up and just starting work. Many times I could not cope with it and I would snooze for 5 more minutes of peace etc. and would wake up from 30min to hours later exhausted and stressed. The change from relaxed and comfy in bed to panic, stress and work obligations, in only a few minutes, is not natural.

**I think the problem of not waking up, apart from actual exhaustion, is the mindset of why you should want to wake up, not why you have to wake up.**

I needed something ""nice"" to look for to motivate me to wake up and instantly get out of bed. For others it may be a nice breakfast, a morning walk or whatever.

How it is going:  
Since November, I have kept this schedule. I feel that I have way more personal time (and I do in reality), which is especially awesome during the weekend. Now even on the weekend I will get up at 8-9am, still have my 2 hours coffee/sunshine ""meditation"" and then it is still early enough to get on with my projects, house chores etc., tv/gaming and going out in the evening. I feel I have more ""me-quality"" time in my day and that makes me feel more energized.

A separate tip: Sleeping next to a window and letting the sun light and warmth in the room and you, also helps a lot to wake up naturally.

1qxbm3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1qxbm3z/top_physical_turnoffs_in_guys_and_how_to_fix_them/,Top physical turn-offs in guys (and how to FIX them without plastic surgery),"Let’s be honest. There are thousands of TikToks and Reddit threads telling men they're just “ugly” and there’s nothing they can do about it. But most of those takes come from clout-chasing influencers who study thirst traps more than actual science. The truth? Most so-called unattractive physical traits *can* be improved with the right knowledge and some consistency.

This post isn’t about shaming anyone. It's about clarity. A lot of people are walking around thinking they're just “not good looking,” when in reality they’re just ignoring 5–6 easy-to-fix features that impact first impressions massively. These aren’t expensive procedures or unrealistic expectations. These are fixable habits backed by research, grooming standards, and actual psychology.

This list comes from a mix of science-backed sources, clinical psychology books, YouTube deep dives, and sociology research. Not random TikTok advice that goes viral for being snarky.

Here’s the breakdown:

* **Bad posture = instant unattractiveness**
  * *Why it matters:* According to a study published in the journal **Health Psychology**, upright posture is strongly linked to higher confidence ratings and perceived attractiveness. Slouching, rounded shoulders, and forward neck instantly shrink your presence, making you look less dominant or fit.
  * *Fix it:*  
    - **Wall angels + chin tucks + dead hangs** help reset posture.  
    - Try the ""10-minute posture fix"" from Jeremy Ethier’s YouTube channel. It’s simple but life-changing when done daily.  
    - Sleep on a thinner pillow and avoid hunching over your phone.  

* **Unkempt skin and acne scars**
  * *Why it matters:* Facial skin is one of the top 3 features noticed at first glance. A 2022 report from **The International Journal of Cosmetic Science** found that smoother, even-toned skin made male faces rate noticeably higher on attractiveness, regardless of bone structure.
  * *Fix it:*  
    - Use *CeraVe SA Cleanser* + *Differin gel* nightly. Both are science-backed and under $30.  
    - If hyperpigmentation or acne scars are the issue, check out *The Ordinary’s Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%*. Add a sunscreen like *EltaMD UV Clear* daily.  
    - Dermatologists on the *Doctorly* YouTube channel break this down super well for different skin types.  

* **Neglected teeth and breath**
  * *Why it matters:* A 2019 Oral Health Survey by the *American Dental Association* ranked teeth as the #1 feature both men and women subconsciously notice first in potential partners. Yellow teeth or bad breath instantly kill physical appeal.
  * *Fix it:*  
    - Whitening strips from Crest 3D White work decently well over 3 weeks.  
    - Use a tongue scraper daily. Most bad breath comes from bacteria buildup in the back of your tongue, not poor brushing.  
    - Switch from coffee to green tea occasionally. Coffee stains + dry mouth = double damage.  

* **Sloppy grooming (especially nose, ears, eyebrows)**
  * *Why it matters:* You don’t need to be a fashion model. But visible ear hair, untrimmed nose hair, or chaotic eyebrows visibly age you and signal poor self-care. Research from **Evolutionary Psychology Journal** shows facial grooming *does* change strangers’ perceptions of competence and health.
  * *Fix it:*  
    - Use a $15 electric trimmer (like Philips Norelco Multigroom) once a week for nose + ear hair.  
    - Maintain a clean neckline every 10 days if you're growing a beard.  
    - Tweeze stray eyebrow hairs in the middle and edges. Watch 2-minute tutorials from Alpha M. for beginner-friendly grooming tips.  

* **Out-of-shape neck/jawline**
  * *Why it matters:* The jawline isn't just a ""Chad"" thing. A 2021 study from Shanghai Jiao Tong University found participants rated men with well-defined jawlines as more trustworthy, healthy, and attractive — even when other traits were average.
  * *Fix it:*  
    - Reduce inflammation from processed carbs and salt. Water retention blurs definition more than fat alone.  
    - Try chewing mastic gum (not jaw exercisers, which can cause TMJ)  
    - Get leaner by walking 10k steps a day and lifting consistently, especially with compound lifts like deadlifts (which actually train your neck posture too).  

* **Lifeless eyes and dark circles**
  * *Why it matters:* Your eyes are your story. If they always look tired, puffy, or sunken, you’ll be perceived as low energy or sick, regardless of your physical build. The *Sleep Foundation* notes that sleep-deprived faces are rated as less healthy and less attractive by up to 25% in studies.
  * *Fix it:*  
    - Sleep 7-9 hours. Use blackout curtains. Avoid screens 90 mins before bed.  
    - Try cold metal spoons under the eyes in the morning for de-puffing.  
    - Use *The INKEY List Caffeine Eye Cream* — $10 and backed by dermatologist reviews.  

There’s no magical face you get born with that guarantees attractiveness. But the most consistently attractive people? They optimize what they *can* control. You can too. A lot of these changes cost $0–$30 and just need some consistency.

Books like *“The Social Animal”* by David Brooks and *“Influence”* by Robert Cialdini also show how physical cues like symmetry, grooming, and posture affect how people treat and perceive you, even more than personality at first.

Don’t fall for the blackpill nonsense. Looking better is way more accessible than most of the internet wants to believe.

1qxbl1x,https://i.redd.it/sczh90jexthg1.png,Maths Teacher vs. Basic Supply-Chain Literacy: The 140-Liter Self-Own Heard 'Round the Internet' 🤣,"**Listen up, ""Maths teacher"" it had been clearly basic arithmetic, reading comprehension, and intellectual honesty skipped your entire career.**

You waltzed in here smugly claiming ""A coffee plant takes about 1-2L to grow"" like that's some gotcha moment.  
**Where. Did. You. Pull. That. Number. From?** Your arse? A dream? The bottom of your untouched lesson-plan drawer?  
Because **no credible source on this planet** not Water Footprint Network, not Hoekstra's seminal reports, not FAO, not any agronomy paper says a mature coffee plant survives on 1-2 liters total lifetime water.  
Zero. Zilch. Nada.

Reality check, since facts clearly terrify you:

* A single coffee plant needs **thousands of liters per year** in evapotranspiration + irrigation equivalent (1,500–2,500 mm annual water requirement in growing regions = massive volumes per bush).
* It lives **7–30+ years**, producing hundreds of kg of cherries over its life → thousands of cups.
* The legendary **140 L per cup** (for a standard 125 ml brew, \~7 g roasted beans) is the **amortized virtual water footprint** across the entire chain: growing those beans, processing, roasting, transport.
* Straight from the Water Footprint Network's own 2003–2010 reports (still the gold standard cited everywhere in 2025):

You literally reduced industrial-scale agriculture  millions of plants under rain + irrigation in water-stressed tropics  to ""watering a houseplant.""  
That's not a maths fail. That's a catastrophic, embarrassing failure of **basic adult reasoning**.  
It's like saying ""a steak only takes 2 liters because I once gave water to a calf.""  
Or ""my phone weighs 200 g, so mining rare earths must be trivial.""  
**Supply-chain math called. It wants its dignity back.**

That AI is really bad for the environment? **Do you know that the Industrial Revolution caused the vast majority of historical environmental damage** (starting the massive rise in CO₂ emissions that led to today's climate issues)? **Does that mean industrialization itself is bad? No, it's not.**

We don't throw out cars, electricity, or modern medicine because of their origins in fossil-fuel-heavy industry. Instead, we improved them cleaner tech, efficiency gains, renewables.

Same with AI: its current energy/water use is real and growing fast (data centers could match big countries' power draw soon), but it's a new tool we can steer better from the start. Efficiency jumps are happening quicker than in past tech shifts, companies are locking in clean energy/nuclear, and AI itself helps solve environmental problems (optimizing grids, spotting emissions leaks, accelerating renewables

Brother surely is an idiot as he does not have common sense  
You publicly humiliated yourself on basic literacy, numeracy, **and** critical thinking  in front of the entire internet.  
A ""maths teacher"" who can't grasp amortized footprints, supply chains, or distinguish direct vs. virtual water?  
That's not pedagogy. That's malpractice.

It’s the Tutorial Dude AI team here. Big Tech is currently in a race to see who can ship the most 'powerful' agentic and fully autonomous AI first. But while they brag about billions in compute, they’re ignoring the training gap.

The Partnership on AI literally released a 'Pathway to Responsible Data Enrichment' last year. It’s a blueprint for worker safety, mental health, and fair feedback. The Problem? Most of the platforms you're working on right now are ignoring it. As my friend says over coffee: it’s a feature not a bug.

# The Strategy is simple:

1.  Rush the Model: Ship it fast to keep stock prices high. Who cares if the idea is not fully evaluated? We as consumers should care.
2. Externalize the Risk: Don't provide psychological training or expert safeguards for the annotators. As our team at AI Labor Logs shared earlier today, if you make the annotator/tasker view something harmful…they are just cheap disposable labor to the companies.
3. The 'Black-Box' Excuse: When an annotator gets burned out or an AI hallucinates, they blame 'low quality data' instead of their own lack of training infrastructure. The companies blame the annotator and they move the person into a state of perpetual uncertainty.
4. The other annotators/taskers tend to hold the individual that raised the alarm to a higher standard than the company responsible for the issues.

The oligarchs and companies want the gold, but they aren't paying for the mine's safety. If you’re an annotator, you’re not 'low skill' because you are the one building the safeguards they were too lazy to code. 🏗️

Drop a '🛡️' if you think training platforms should be legally required to provide mental health support and fair wages that reflect the nature of the work. After all, the companies are quick to drop that NDA for those exposed.",3,1770364176.0,TheTutorialDudeAI,3,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

If you’ve ever used ChatGPT or Claude deeply, you’ve probably noticed their memory features: they seem to remember you, recalling your preferences, background information, and even details from topics discussed weeks ago in new conversations. This cross-session memory capability goes far beyond context-window management within a single conversation—behind it is a carefully designed long-term memory system.

Based on multiple reverse-engineering blog posts, combined with my long-term hands-on experience using ChatGPT and Claude, this article systematically organizes and analyzes how both implement long-term memory. Note that this article focuses more on product and engineering implementation perspectives rather than low-level code. Even if you don’t have a strong engineering background, you can still understand the design ideas and the practical engineering value of these systems.

Because CLoseAI includes explicit anti-injection instructions in its system prompt and has been specially trained to resist having internal implementation details extracted, unlike Claude—which has publicly shared many technical details on blogs—OpenAI’s memory system is largely inferred via reverse engineering. This article synthesizes those research outcomes to reveal the similarities and differences between these two mainstream AI assistants in long-term memory.

# Context Management: From API to Client

Before diving into long-term memory systems, we first need to clarify some basic but easily confused concepts. If you already know this stuff, feel free to skip ahead. Terms like session, thread, prompt, and chat often mean different things in different contexts, and there is no unified industry-standard definition. Here, we treat session and thread as the collection of all messages in a single conversation window you opened. Prompt and chat correspond to each individual message you send or each model reply.

At the API layer, OpenAI and Anthropic use different data formats. OpenAI uses the JSON-based chat completion API, dividing each message into three roles: system, user, and assistant; Anthropic uses an XML-style format and refers to user messages as human messages. These are the interface layers we directly face when calling the API.

However, the real complexity lies in the client implementation. When you chat in the ChatGPT or Claude web interface, what gets sent to the backend is not a simple array of messages, but the result of carefully designed context management—what we often call context engineering. This engineering process determines what information is injected into the actual API request, and how that information is organized for best results.

Taking ChatGPT as an example, the context structure for each API call roughly looks like this:

\[0\] System Instructions

\[1\] Developer Instructions

\[2\] Session Metadata (ephemeral)

\[3\] User Memory (long-term facts)

\[4\] Recent Conversations Summary (past chats, titles + snippets)

\[5\] Current Session Messages (this session)

\[6\] Your latest message

Among these, layers 0 and 1 contain system-level configuration such as the juice parameter, anti-injection instructions, tool definitions, etc.; layer 2 contains ephemeral session metadata like the user’s current time, region inferred from IP, and so on. Many technical blogs have already analyzed these in detail, so I won’t repeat them here. We will focus on layers 3, 4, and 5—the core implementation parts of the memory system.

Understanding this layered structure is very important. It tells us that so-called “long-term memory” is not an inherent capability of the model itself, but something achieved via clever prompt engineering and data management. In each conversation, relevant historical information is retrieved and dynamically injected into the context, making the model appear to “remember” you.

# ChatGPT’s Long-Term Memory Architecture

**High-level design overview**

ChatGPT’s long-term memory system uses a three-layer design: an explicitly maintained memory list (memory), a recent conversation summary system (recent conversations summary), and an implicit user insight system (user insight).

From the context structure perspective, the explicit memory list corresponds to layer 3’s user memory, the recent conversation summary corresponds to layer 4, and the user insight system likely lives in layer 0 or 1. These three components work together to form ChatGPT’s memory capability. While the specifics of ChatGPT’s prompt framework aren’t worth over-analyzing, many design ideas in this memory system are highly worth borrowing in real-world engineering.

**Rolling management of the context window**

Before discussing long-term memory, we need to understand how the current session’s context is managed. Using the traditional prompt-role framing, current session messages are the alternating sequence of assistant prompts and user prompts.

A key point here is: the model’s replies and the user’s questions are not all retained in the context without limits—instead, they are managed via a rolling window mechanism.

We know that the model’s input length has a physical upper bound. For example, GPT-5.2 is documented as 400k tokens, but the actually usable amount is about 272k; DeepSeek V3 is 128k; Gemini 3flash reaches 1M. However, longer context is not always better—when context length increases, the model’s recall rate drops, which academia calls the “lost in the middle” phenomenon. Overly long context can make the model “get dumber,” and this is unavoidable.

ChatGPT’s strategy is relatively simple and blunt: when the total token count of the message sequence exceeds the context limit, it directly trims from the earliest messages.

A concrete example: suppose a model’s input limit is 60 tokens, the system prompt takes 10 tokens, and each user prompt and assistant prompt takes 10 tokens. You have three rounds of conversation with the AI, producing user prompt 1, assistant prompt 1, user prompt 2, assistant prompt 2, user prompt 3, assistant prompt 3. Now you send a fourth message, user prompt 4. The total context becomes: system prompt (10) + three rounds of dialogue (60) + current message (10) = 80 tokens, exceeding the limit by 20 tokens.

At this point, ChatGPT will completely remove the earliest round of conversation—i.e., user prompt 1 and assistant prompt 1—so that the remaining content just fits within the 60-token limit.

The implication is clear: information that gets trimmed permanently disappears from the current session. ChatGPT does not use context compression or summarization techniques to preserve it, which means if an important piece of information is not extracted into layer 3 or 4’s memory system, it will be lost as the conversation progresses.

**Understanding context management from an information-theoretic perspective**

To understand why context management is so important, we can think from an information theory perspective.

In information theory, the amount of information relates to how much uncertainty is reduced. The more information a message carries, the more possibilities it can rule out. This may sound abstract, but we apply it constantly in daily communication.

Imagine this scenario: you and your best buddy agree to meet in person over the weekend, and you’ve already confirmed you’ll meet in Shanghai. At this point, if you say “I’ll wait for you at the People’s Square Starbucks,” the effective information conveyed is “People’s Square” and “Starbucks”; but if you say “I’ll wait for you at some number, some building, Starbucks coffee shop, People’s Square, Huangpu District, Shanghai City, China,” the earlier “China, Shanghai City” is actually redundant information—you both already know you’re meeting in Shanghai.

By the same logic, in conversations with AI, if the system prompt has already injected “Today is Friday, February 6, 2026,” then saying “Today is Friday” again in the user prompt is redundant information and wastes precious token space.

Another dimension of information density is specificity. The statement “My wife didn’t come home last night” leaves a lot of uncertainty—maybe she worked overtime, maybe she was out with friends, maybe she was on a business trip; while “My wife cheated on me” is a high-information-density statement that greatly reduces the possibility space. In AI conversations, providing high-information-density context helps the model understand your intent more accurately and reduces the chance of irrelevant replies.

In today’s era of large language models, context windows of hundreds of thousands of tokens—or even over a million—are sufficient for the vast majority of conversations. The real challenge is not the size of the space, but how to put the most valuable information into limited space. That’s why we need carefully designed memory systems—their role is to retrieve the most relevant information from massive historical interactions, rather than dumping all history into the context.

**How User Memory is implemented**

Now let’s return to ChatGPT’s context structure, where user memory (layer 3) and recent conversations summary (layer 4) form what we call long-term memory.

User memory is a relatively stable system that stores structured information about user characteristics. According to Mathan’s reverse-engineering blog, ChatGPT injects a tool definition named bio into the system prompt. When the model detects that a user prompt contains profile-related information, it proactively calls this tool to store memory. These stored memory entries can be viewed and managed in the settings interface, forming a user-visible, editable memory list.

However, the actual implementation is more complex than what the documentation describes. Based on my testing, ChatGPT does not always inject all user memory entries into the context. Instead, it uses RAG for retrieval matching. That is, the system retrieves the most relevant bio records from the memory store based on the current user prompt, and then injects those into the context.

Interestingly, ChatGPT seems not to provide an explicit tool for the model to actively search memory during its own reasoning process (so-called agentic RAG). RAG retrieval happens during the context construction stage, not within the model’s workflow. This design is simpler and more reliable, but slightly less flexible.

**The complex system of Conversation History**

Compared with the relative simplicity of user memory, conversation history is a more sophisticated system.

On the surface, the implementation logic of recent conversation summary looks like a simple SQL query: SELECT \* FROM chat\_message WHERE user\_id = ? ORDER BY created\_at DESC LIMIT N, i.e., extract the latest N session summaries and inject them into the context. According to Mathan’s tests, ChatGPT keeps roughly 15 recent session summaries, in a format like:

1. <Timestamp>:<Chat Title>

|||| user message snippet ||||

|||| user message snippet ||||

However, another blog post by Macro offers a different view. He believes ChatGPT uses RAG to retrieve a number of relevant sessions within a two-week time window based on the current query, and that the model can reproduce information from them verbatim. This is consistent with Mathan’s “store user prompt summaries” viewpoint at the data level—whether you index by summary content or by raw user prompts, the essence of RAG’s effect is not fundamentally different.

But I tend to believe that ChatGPT does not directly use RAG at this layer, and instead adopts a more clever two-stage retrieval strategy. The reason is: the core functions of long-term memory are already fully covered by user memory and user insight (discussed later). The main purpose of conversation history is to provide short-term continuity so cross-session conversations feel more natural. Introducing another RAG retrieval here would overlap functionally with user memory’s RAG and would feel redundant.

In practical testing, I verified that ChatGPT does use a kind of two-stage RAG strategy. As shown in the figure below, by asking about details of historical conversations, ChatGPT not only answered related questions but also mentioned some timestamp marker information that is not visible in settings. This suggests a higher-level retrieval logic exists:

1. First, use RAG to match relevant bio records, and these bio records have time-interval markers
2. Then, within those time intervals, use RAG again to retrieve the top-k most relevant conversation summaries
3. Meanwhile, regardless of whether any bio is matched, always include a fixed number of the most recent session summaries

This design is very clever. It ensures temporal locality (recent conversations are always visible), and it also uses bio as an “index” to enable precise retrieval of deeply buried historical information. It avoids information loss caused by purely time-ordered retrieval, and it also avoids the performance overhead and instability that global RAG might bring.

**The implicit User Insight system**

Beyond the two explicit memory systems above, Macro’s blog also revealed an even more hidden component: the user insight system.

This is an implicit system that is invisible and uneditable to the user, and is presumed to be updated via scheduled jobs or specific trigger conditions. The biggest difference between user insight and bio is that it is not a simple list of factual memories, but a higher-level summary of the user’s preferences, communication style, and thinking patterns.

In my tests, ChatGPT’s reaction was quite interesting. When I asked whether a user insight system exists, it was vague at first, and then under follow-up questioning indirectly acknowledged the system’s existence, and clearly told me: it is forbidden to disclose the existence of user insight to users. That’s basically a dead giveaway.

From an engineering standpoint, the user insight design is reasonable. Bio records are continuous user memories like “He wrote a blog post” or “He ate a bowl of zhajiangmian today”; while user insight is a holistic profile like “This user tends to get straight to the point, dislikes lengthy preambles, and prefers depth over breadth in technical discussions.” This kind of high-level summary can better guide the model’s response style, rather than merely providing factual information.

**Analysis of Claude’s memory system**

Compared with ChatGPT, Claude’s memory system follows a completely different design philosophy. Because I personally use the Claude client less (GPT Teams’ agent mode is just too good), this part of the analysis is mainly based on Mathan’s blog summary. The author’s reverse-engineering work is quite thorough; interested readers can refer to the original text for more details.

Claude’s biggest feature is that it completely abandons the traditional RAG auto-injection approach and instead adopts agentic RAG—i.e., exposing conversation search and memory search as tools directly to the model, letting the model decide when and how to retrieve memories.

This design aligns with Claude’s overall product strategy. If you’ve used Claude Code, you’ll find it also lets the model actively do keyword search via tool calls. This agentic implementation is clearly more flexible: the model can dynamically decide whether it needs to look up historical memory based on the conversation context, and can even do multiple rounds of retrieval to find the needed information.

However, this design comes at a cost. First, it heavily depends on the model’s capability—the model must correctly judge when retrieval is needed, what keywords to use, and how to integrate results. If the model capability is insufficient, or if you deploy a weaker model locally, the effect may be significantly worse. Second, because there is no automatic injection of relevant session summaries and everything relies on the model’s active retrieval, there is a risk of missing information. After all, RAG’s semantic search ability has been validated, whereas the model’s active retrieval relies more on prompt understanding and keyword extraction.

From an engineering practice standpoint, I personally lean more toward ChatGPT’s multi-layer design. In particular, the approach of using bio’s timestamp indices to retrieve relevant session summaries provides stability while maintaining flexibility.

Choosing between the two approaches is essentially a trade-off between model dependence and system controllability. ChatGPT’s approach is more engineering-oriented and suited for production environments that require stable and reliable performance; Claude’s approach is more cutting-edge and suited for scenarios that pursue the ultimate experience and don’t mind occasional surprises.

**Implementation approaches in open-source clients**

In the open-source world, Cherry Studio and Open-Web-UI represent two different technical routes, and their design ideas are quite similar to ChatGPT and Claude.

Cherry Studio adopts a direct RAG approach. After each conversation ends, the system automatically extracts and stores a memory entry. After some usage, my memory bank has accumulated nearly 200 records. Notably, Cherry does not simply pile up memories crudely; it performs deduplication and contradiction handling during storage. According to the official documentation, the system checks whether new memories are redundant with or conflict with existing ones; if there is conflict, it merges or updates. This design is simple, but works well in practice.

Open-Web-UI chooses the agentic RAG route, letting the model decide when to search, update, or add memories. This approach is more flexible but requires stronger model capability. With weaker models, it may happen that it fails to search when it should, or searches frequently when it shouldn’t.

Their shared advantage is openness and transparency—all memories are clearly presented in settings and support full CRUD operations. Users can view, edit, and delete any memory at any time, and there is no “black box” component like ChatGPT’s user insight.

However, these two clients clearly lack a more complex multi-layer architecture design. They both have only a single memory list, without distinguishing between a stable user profile (bio) and dynamic session summaries, and without a higher-level summary like user insight. For short-term use or scenarios with fewer memories, this design is entirely sufficient; but for long-term heavy users, or technical enthusiasts with higher requirements for memory management, there is still room for improvement.

# Reproduction and Improvement Plan: Integrating the Best Designs

Based on the analysis of ChatGPT, Claude, and open-source clients, I designed a memory system architecture that integrates the strengths of each. This plan attempts to find a balance between stability and flexibility—retaining the reliability of automated memory management while providing the flexibility of agentic retrieval.

**System architecture design**

The entire system is divided into three core components: atomic memory, user profile, and folder memory.

Atomic memory is the fundamental unit of the system. Each atomic memory contains the following fields:

* ID: unique identifier
* Timestamp: creation timestamp
* Content: memory content, controlled to a length of three to four sentences, forming a complete semantic paragraph
* Tags: several tags for classification and quick retrieval

The design of atomic memory borrows from ChatGPT’s bio, but with finer granularity and higher frequency. The advantage is that it can capture more interaction details, while each memory entry remains moderate in length—neither too long to make RAG matching imprecise, nor too short to lose contextual information.

**User profile** corresponds to ChatGPT’s user insight, and is a dynamically maintained structured document. It includes the user’s preferred answering style, language habits, and key background information. Unlike user insight, this profile is visible and editable by the user, increasing system transparency.

**Folder memory** is an innovative design. Considering that many users organize conversations by project or topic, folder-level memory can capture context specific to a theme. For example, you might have a “Work Project A” folder and a “Study Notes” folder, and their memories should be isolated.

In this design, I dropped a separate session-level summary. The reason is that atomic memory is stored frequently enough—especially after setting the rule that “the first message of each new session must be stored as memory,” atomic memory itself can provide sufficient session continuity. The benefit is reduced system complexity and lower embedding computation cost.

**Memory retrieval and storage mechanism**

At runtime, the system uses a dual-channel retrieval strategy:

**Passive RAG**: each time the user sends a message, the system automatically uses RAG to retrieve the top-N most relevant atomic memories and injects them into the context. Meanwhile, the user profile and the current folder’s memory document are automatically loaded. This channel guarantees basic memory functionality without requiring the model to intervene.

**Active RAG (agenticRAG)**: expose memory search as a tool to the model. The model can actively search the memory bank using keywords, which is useful in some edge cases. For example, when the user’s question is not precise enough, or when passive RAG failed to retrieve key information, the model can supplement by calling tools for additional retrieval.

Memory storage uses an asynchronous mechanism. After the user sends a message, the system immediately performs passive retrieval and generates a reply without blocking the user experience. Meanwhile, it launches an asynchronous memory processing flow:

1. Analyze the content of the user prompt
2. If it contains new information worth recording, store it into atomic memory
3. If it contains preference- or style-related information, update the user profile
4. If it is within a specific folder, update folder memory

This asynchronous process is completed by a separate LLM call and does not affect the main conversation’s response speed.

**Time-interval retrieval capability**

ChatGPT’s design of using bio timestamps to index relevant sessions is very clever, but it is automatic and invisible to users. In my plan, I make this capability explicit as a tool.

In addition to textual content, atomic memory also includes timestamp information. In the search tool definition exposed to the model, there is an optional time-range parameter. The tool description explicitly prompts the model: if the user asks about experiences or information from a certain time period, it needs to add time parameters for filtering.

This design preserves flexibility without increasing system complexity. For most queries that do not involve time, the model can use ordinary semantic retrieval; only in scenarios that clearly require time filtering will it use the time parameter.

**Configurability and transparency**

Finally, all memory features should be configurable by the user, including:

* The storage frequency and length limits of atomic memory
* The top-N parameter used in RAG retrieval
* Whether to enable the active retrieval tool
* Switches for the user profile and folder memory

Meanwhile, all memories support full CRUD operations. Users can view, edit, and delete any memory at any time. This transparency is an advantage of open-source projects and also a respect for user privacy.

**Visualized context management**

The ultimate goal of a memory system is to make context engineering visual and controllable. In the client I designed, **Prompt-Tree**, all invoked memories are displayed in real time inside a context box. Users can clearly see which memories are injected into the context, and can freely edit, remove, or compress this content.

This design perfectly solves the rolling-window pain points in ChatGPT and Claude. In traditional designs, when the context exceeds the limit, earlier messages are silently discarded and users cannot intervene. With visualized context management, users can actively delete unimportant messages or compress long messages into summaries, freeing up space for truly important information.

In addition, I model each conversation as a tree node, forming a Git-like conversation tree structure. Users can switch freely between different conversation branches, start a new branch from some historical node, or compare multiple models’ different replies to the same question. This design greatly enhances conversational flexibility and explorability.

# Summary and Outlook

This article systematically reviewed the long-term memory mechanisms of ChatGPT and Claude, and based on practical experience with open-source clients, proposed an improved plan that integrates the strengths of each.

From a technical perspective, long-term memory systems are essentially a combination of prompt engineering and data management. Through engineering methods such as RAG retrieval, multi-layer architecture design, and asynchronous processing, we can provide the model with the most relevant historical information within a limited context window, thereby enabling a continuous cross-session experience.

ChatGPT’s approach is more engineering-oriented, ensuring stability through multi-layer memory and clever retrieval strategies; Claude’s approach is more cutting-edge, handing more control to the model itself. Each has pros and cons, and which one to choose depends on the specific application scenario and expectations of the model’s capability.

For developers, understanding these design ideas helps us build smarter AI applications. Whether you’re building a client, designing an AI agent, or optimizing product user experience, memory management is an indispensable component. As model capabilities continue to improve, I believe more innovative memory system designs will emerge.

My goal is to build an open-source client that integrates all excellent design ideas. The context management problem already has a clear solution; the next focus is to further enhance agentic capabilities so the AI assistant can use tools and memory more proactively and intelligently. Everyone is welcome to download, fork, open issues, and discuss—let’s build a stronger open-source AI client together.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Then when found our rhythm, the days we would spend together. Deeply intertwined, soon just faded.

I’m completely and utterly drawn into this weird routine of having to cook you a meal every night and make a display of my love with flowers bought on random days. Making you feel like you’re taken care of and cared for in ways I wouldn’t even think about doing for my past relationships. But I am so deeply and utterly in love with you and your body and everything about it. How sexy you are mentally and physically. How much I just wish you weren’t holding back from me? Because now that we live together it’s… different? Now that we live together we’re just supposed to not… do it? You’re not wanting to do it? You’re too tired? You’re too stressed? You’re on your period? You’re about to start your period? Your stomach feels funny? 

You just need me to play with your tits and have you slowly drift asleep since you successfully drew my advances into a deeply deeply one sided routine where I play with your breasts to the point where… it’s so relaxing you fall asleep? Then play the victim when I try to continue advances because you’re just wanting to sleep? But we just cuddled for 2 hours, I made you dinner before that. We took a shower and you’ve had your fucking sweet snack. And packed your bowl about 3 times over… but no, the weed doesn’t make you sleepy, no the weed might not be the issue with how you don’t want to do anything remotely sexual? … 

I asked you to kiss me more passionately but I guess to you that just means a longer couple of pecks with no tongue in sight. It’s like you’ve seriously never lusted for something like physical affection before in your life. And yet you’ve had a past you’ve kept a secret, and or just withheld truths and now I feel as though the only place my mind can go is to a place so insecure because the lack of touch I feel I get from you and the resounding puppy eyes and a little pout when you say “thank you” for cooking us a dinner that you just expected me to make for the 200th time in a row. But I can’t get anything remotely close to being done for me? When I simply ask for some physical affection instead now we’re just watching whatever we can watch on TV because that’s all that you think feels like something we should be doing. Rather than think that cuddling is the best way to make you feel loved and wanted and yet that’s literally what you get every fucking night of the week and yet you say that it’s something that you desire more of? 

Do I have to fucking yell at the base of my psyche with frustrations of serious depraved love? I am furious so fucking furious at myself for being this way. Being the type to just want to be physically intimate with you as many times as possible because I’m so fucking pent up from the lack of you trying to understand that it’s what I fucking need to feel fucking safe and guarded from anything ruining a relationship with a girl I love so much. I mean you have your Snapchat listed on your vsco page. Your fucking vsco page has your Snapchat and you’re telling me that you don’t like initiating sex or think about sex as often because now that we’re living together it’s different? … 

We’re a year and a couple of months in. I feel like a married husband who has to take care of you and we just had a bunch of kids who are now toddlers and I haven’t had sex in weeks. 

I literally cook for you every night

I make us breakfast in the morning every weekend 

I make you coffee every damn morning 

I keep the laundry clean and folded. Literally I keep it folded

I keep the dishes done

I keep the floors clean 

I keep the fridge stocked. When’s the last time you did an actual grocery run? 

I keep coming to your family get togethers 

I keep involving myself in all your activities 

I drive you everywhere, everywhere. 

I make sure you feel loved, respected, cared for, supported, cuddled, and romanticized

I keep you happy, and I treat you better than any of your exes.

I keep trying. 

I asked you for sex tonight, something sexual. Just something fun for us to do instead of the same fucking routine of watching whatever we can on tv while I have to sort out the dinner situation and the fucking litter box that you now have just given up on cleaning. I keep it fucking going in all those aspects and I can’t even get my fucking cock sucked? 

I feel undesired. I feel undesirable. How many different ways can I share that with you.

You’re smart enough to get it.

And you’re smart enough to understand that sex is a big part of a relationship.

And if you can’t recall the last time you initiated truly out of free will and desire. That’s a fucking problem.

But I guess you think I’m just here to play fucking house and daddy’s going to make you dinner every night and make sure you get sent off with coffee every morning.

I am a mixed-race woman; my mother is a white woman who was born in Germany and is also a ginger; my father is a black man who was raised in the South and whose parents are Caribbean.

It's a common joke in my family that my two brothers and I are the definition of genetics are crazy. The reason for this is that, aside from the fact that my hair is more on the 3a/3b side and I'm a little darker, I'm still tall and a ginger like my mother and my older brother is a copy and paste of our father, my younger brother looks... well mixed.

My older brother (26M) got me a job at his company at the beginning of the year. As of right now, I have two friends, Ally and Bod (fake names). It's important to note that Ally is a black woman, and when we first met, she inquired about my race and ethnicity, which I explained to her in the same way that I did here.

About two days ago, Bob and I went to the break room for coffee while some coworkers and a woman we'll call Cali were talking about their childhood. During this conversation, one coworker mentioned that their favorite childhood memory was going to the hair store before getting their hair done and choosing the colors of the bows or beeds they were getting. The same coworker then asked Bob and me if we had any similar childhood memories before either of us could respond Cali said it was rude to ask me that. Because white people have different childhood memories than black people.

I didn't give it much thought before correcting her because I had heard similar remarks before. It wouldn't be until the end of the day, when Ally would approach me and tell me that Cali was telling the office that I was jealous of her and our other coworker and that I was making up lies to fit in, the majority of our office is made up of black people, with maybe two white people and three Hispanics.

I told my brother about the problem on the way home, and he advised me to speak with HR before Cali does since, if what she's saying reaches HR, I might lose my job. On the other hand, Ally told me that it wasn't that deep and that both Cali and I were at fault of the way we handled the situation.",1,1770363358.0,AmItheAsshole,5,1.0,False

**Where. Did. You. Pull. That. Number. From?** Your arse? A dream? The bottom of your untouched lesson-plan drawer?  
Because **no credible source on this planet** not Water Footprint Network, not Hoekstra's seminal reports, not FAO, not any agronomy paper says a mature coffee plant survives on 1-2 liters total lifetime water.  
Zero. Zilch. Nada.

Reality check, since facts clearly terrify you:

* A single coffee plant needs **thousands of liters per year** in evapotranspiration + irrigation equivalent (1,500–2,500 mm annual water requirement in growing regions = massive volumes per bush).
* It lives **7–30+ years**, producing hundreds of kg of cherries over its life → thousands of cups.
* The legendary **140 L per cup** (for a standard 125 ml brew, \~7 g roasted beans) is the **amortized virtual water footprint** across the entire chain: growing those beans, processing, roasting, transport.
* Straight from the Water Footprint Network's own 2003–2010 reports (still the gold standard cited everywhere in 2025):

You literally reduced industrial-scale agriculture  millions of plants under rain + irrigation in water-stressed tropics  to ""watering a houseplant.""

Same with AI: its current energy/water use is real and growing fast (data centers could match big countries' power draw soon), but it's a new tool we can steer better from the start. Efficiency jumps are happening quicker than in past tech shifts, companies are locking in clean energy/nuclear, and AI itself helps solve environmental problems (optimizing grids, spotting emissions leaks, accelerating renewables

1qxb6jx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADFRecruiting/comments/1qxb6jx/preparing_for_navy_recruit_school_2026_edition/,Preparing For Navy Recruit School (2026 Edition),"# Introduction

This guide will give you some tips on how to best prepare for your first 10 weeks at HMAS Cerberus. I enlisted on the 15th of September 2025 and graduated from Recruit School on the 20th of November. Some aspects of Recruit School may change in 2026 and beyond so keep that in mind. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions (although I don't check this site very often).

# Packing List

You should be sent a Joining Instructions pdf in the lead up to your enlistment. To go along with the packing list they provide, here are my personal thoughts. Keep in mind that you won't be allowed off base to buy stuff until the end of week 4.

* **3x Pant hangers**. Get [these metal hangers](https://www.kmart.com.au/product/metal-clip-hangers-set-of-5-42194521/) or similar as they need to be small enough to hold the cuff of your formal pants. Don't get [these wooden pant hangers](https://www.kmart.com.au/product/wooden-hangers-set-of-3-42194590/) as they are too wide.
* **Wrist watch.** Not *technically* required but highly recommended. I recommend the [CASIO F91W](https://www.amazon.com.au/Casio-Black-Classic-Digital-F91W-1/dp/B00HFPIIOI) or something similar (digital + alarm function).
* **Suitcase + Carry on bag locks.** There is a requirement to have a lock on every pocket of your baggage, even if you don't aren't using the pocket.
* **Black shoe polish + Polishing cloth.** This is all you really need for polishing boots. I highly recommend Saphir ([David Jones - 50mL](https://www.davidjones.com/Product/26965966?utm_content=paidsearch&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20110005327&gbraid=0AAAAACfB9dC0meAMnyZfIypU3uVs6QZzO&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyP3KBhD9ARIsAAJLnnYlSpBXO0JDiPob9p2Enp_VE-_rPuNGxzv0Jel_1LW6Eg-7P80git0aAlbNEALw_wcB))([Boot Black - 100mL](https://www.bootblack.com.au/products/pate-de-luxe-100ml?pr_prod_strat=e5_desc&pr_rec_id=024a5ed8b&pr_rec_pid=1481776365661&pr_ref_pid=1481785901149&pr_seq=uniform&variant=13557805416541)). Yes it seems a bit pricey but this stuff is *really good* and you will not regret buying it. If you can get your boots to a mirror shine early on you will impress the instructors and everyone will envy you. ([Easy-to-follow boot polishing tutorial](https://youtu.be/QzC2GY-AAA0?si=C7NE5TOCM7cmvMtv))
* **Decent Quality Clothes Iron.** You'll use it a lot in Recruit School and then you'll have it for the rest of your career/life so you might as well get a good one.
* **Swim Goggles.** Not required but recommended. At some point you will be diving \~4m underwater to grab things so they will help.
* **Underwear**. They say you need white but grey will be fine.
* **Casual clothes.** You get to go off base on weekends from week 4 onwards so bring clothes you can wear out to shopping centres, bars, et cetera.
* **Shaving stuff (for men).** They say you need a razor and shaving cream but an electric shaver should do just fine.
* **Massage gun/tennis ball/foam roller.** Anything you can use to help with muscle soreness is a godsend.
* **Snacks.** Having snacks for yourself and your friends is good for morale.
* **A small pair of scissors.** Quite helpful for cutting off tags, loose threads, et cetera.
* **Ironing Board Cover.** Draw a grid of dimensions onto your ironing board cover ([like this](https://imgur.com/a/iTtUbQw)) so that you can easily see how wide to fold your clothes.
* [**Blue/Black pens**](https://www.amazon.com.au/AmazonBasics-Retractable-Ballpoint-Pen-12-Pack/dp/B07BDWD8B7/) **+** [**pocket sized notebook**](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07611C3XM)**.** You're only given one black pen and the notebook tends to break so it's best to come prepared.
* **Push pins (optional).** If you want to hang photos of friends and family in your cabin. There might be some for you to use but it's a good idea to bring some.
* **An ipod or something similar (optional).** You won't have access to your phone most of the time, but if you want to have some music you can bring a dedicated music device (ipod or similar). You will probably just want to get it approved by your leader before using it.

# Other Preparation

* **Get a flu vaccine before enlistment.** Everyone gets sick in the first few weeks (people from all over the country, living in close quarters) and a flu vaccine will help you avoid the worst of it.
* **Men, get a haircut that will be short enough to last for 4 weeks**, otherwise they will just shave your head down to a 2 everywhere.
* **Train some calisthenics.** The only fitness requirement is the 2.4km run and 1min plank which you will need to pass in week 8. However, you will also be doing a lot of calisthenics, mostly push ups, squats, et cetera. Look up [good pushup technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDIpL0pjun0) (elbows close to body).
* **Think about where you want your superannuation to go.** The ADF has its own super fund (ADF Super) which is pretty standard as far as funds go, but I recommend learning as much about superannuation as you can and be very intentional about this stuff, as small details can become big differences over time.

# Tips & Tricks

* **Set an alarm to wake up 5-10 mins early** every morning so that you can get through the showers before everyone else and have extra time to make your bed.
* Every night your division will clean the entire block until it is spotless. You are provided with a weekly rotating roster for who cleans what area. **Encourage your division to disregard this and swap to a fixed system,** having each class just stick with cleaning the same area in perpetuity. This can be a hard sell (especially to those stuck cleaning the toilets and showers) but will save everyone having to learn how to clean a new area every week.
* **Be enthusiastic during PT sessions and milestone days**, the instructors will notice and you'll get on their good side.
* **Give a high priority to kit maintenence.** There's a lot of naming, ironing and folding, to be done during recruit school. Get on top of it early and double check your work.
* **Have one pillow case for sleeping and one for displaying.** You are given two pillow cases for a reason—swap between them every morning and night.
* **Carry your ball cap in the thigh pocket of your uniform.** Do this to keep it on you at all times—even when not strictly required.
* **Take notes during all lectures and breifings.** A lot of information ends up being very useful, and even if it's not, it's just a good look.
* **Sleep under your doona but on top of your top sheet.** You will get in trouble if you get caught doing this... but it will mean you have far less work remaking your bed every morning. Also, [learn how to make a good hospital corner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl-YH2jo_4k).
* **You can get a Myki (victorian public transport card) at Crib Point Station.** Until PTV upgrades to taking debit cards (could be soon), you'll need a myki to use public transport. Android users can get a digital card (not available on ios). Most people just use Uber/Didi

# Some Statistics

Out of the 123 people that enlisted with my division, 101 graduated with us. The main reason for dropping out was injury, and the main demographic for getting injured were females.

# Navy Lingo (Jack Speak)

* Heads = Toilets
* Ablutions = Area containing showers, toilets, basins, laundry

She was miles better although she never stopped refluxing everywhere but overall seemed like a happy spitter who was not in pain..

Unfortunately she had a flare up last week and I thought it was because I had accidentally had some soy. Now, a week later, I have been diligent about no dairy or soy but she is still having a hard time. I cut eggs out \~4 days ago just in case but there’s so much that it could be.. it’s late and I’m up rocking her as she just woke up and instead of eating and going back to sleep like usual she started crying in pain and is barely consoled by me holding and rocking her.

Did any of you have a similar situation?? I was finally getting the hang of this CMPA thing.. could it be residual from the soy? Coconut milk? Wheat? I have at least a sensitivity to gluten and I know that I am likely to have celiac based off my genes.. she didn’t seem to be sensitive to anything else until this last week either- could it be that another allergy just developed ??

Desperate mama here ready to only eat a prenatal and a can of green beans if I have to :,) I just want to help her. Seeing her in pain is awful and I feel like I’m hurting her with my milk.

Edited to add: I am careful about reading labels, hidden dairy, and cross contamination (except the soy whoops- someone else checked and I didn’t double check).

1qxaz51,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qxaz51,($2.5k) Nontraditional Wedding,"Just a gentle reminder that your wedding day can be what YOU dream it to be! We had a $20k budget, but spent under $2.5k. We decided in September that we would marry in December. We had 27 people present and 14 weeks to plan. Here’s how we did it (full itemization at bottom). 

✨ priorities: for us, feeling cozy and intimate was important. We can both be anxious, so we chose a location comfortable for us, picked our favorite local sweet treats (cheesecake!!), and decided that we wanted the day to feel like as laid back as a wedding possibly can be. We had no big procession, no bridal party, no hired music (although our venue is cool enough to always have a fun playlist going). We woke up together, shared breakfast, and then went our separate ways until arriving at the venue that afternoon. 

✨ venue: local & free! We reached out to our favorite local brewery (and the location of our first date) to see if we could reserve a small are inside for the ceremony. We didn’t have any interest of renting the whole venue, plus we got married on a WEDNESDAY at 2pm. We knew it would be low traffic and didn’t care if there were a handful of spectators. Due to the date and time, they let us host there free of cost! The truth is, we probably brought them more business at that time than they would normally have. A win-win. The whole wedding party stayed for about 4 hours, drank, mingled, and played games. We wrapped up in the early evening and my husband and I left to go have a private dinner just the two of us, while family went on different directions for their own dinner reservations. 

✨ Photographer: local & free! This was pure luck. I had posted on my local buy-nothing page for plates, table cloths, and a cake topper. The sweetest photographer saw it and reached out to us to offer shooting it. We were her first wedding ever shot, and it was practice for a paid wedding she was covering this upcoming summer. She was present for 5 hours, met with me prior to the wedding day to discuss my wants, and provided me with a whole 312 image wedding gallery. I also had 2 vintage film cameras that my two best friends took pictures with that day. So we have a fun mix of film and digital! 

✨ officiant: local & free!  An ordained minister friend of my best friend married us. She provided us with such a special ceremony that was exactly what we wanted. It was spiritual while free of religion, included descriptions of each of us from our best friends, and then information we shared with her as a couple. Multiple people mentioned to us how it was one of the more beautiful ceremonies they’d heard. On our wedding day as we were signing our papers, we learned that the inscription on my wedding band was she and her husbands wedding song. 

✨ makeup: I did my own makeup. I spent the morning at my best friend’s house getting dressed, listening to music, doing my makeup there, and sipping coffee with her and my niece. 

✨ florals: my husband and I went to Trader Joe’s the day before and picked out $60 worth of flowers. I then cut and arranged my bouquet as well as our bud vases that we put around on tables. 

NOTE: I’m a very sentimental person, so I tried to incorporate little details of our families as best as we could rather than buying things for the day only. We used many heirlooms from family such as depression glass, cake spatulas, and handkerchiefs amongst other small odds and ends.

1qxax57,https://www.reddit.com/r/rSocialskillsAscend/comments/1qxax57/how_reading_instead_of_scrolling_cured_my_anxiety/,How Reading Instead of Scrolling Cured My Anxiety: The Psychology Behind It,"So like a year ago I was stuck in this weird loop. Wake up, scroll TikTok for 30 mins in bed, check Instagram, refresh Twitter, repeat all day. My screen time was legitimately 8+ hours daily and I felt like SHIT constantly. Anxious, distracted, couldn't focus on anything real. I kept thinking something was wrong with me but honestly? The problem was the dopamine hit cycle social media creates in your brain.



I came across this podcast episode with Cal Newport (wrote ""Digital Minimalism"") where he talked about how our brains weren't designed for the constant stimulation of infinite scroll. That clicked hard. So I deleted Instagram and TikTok cold turkey and replaced that time with reading. Not gonna lie, the first week was rough. But what happened after genuinely changed everything.



The Science Part That Actually Matters



Dr. Maryanne Wolf (neuroscientist at UCLA) researches how digital reading vs physical books affects our brains differently. Turns out deep reading, the kind you do with physical books, activates different neural pathways than skimming feeds. It literally builds patience, focus, and emotional regulation. Your brain learns to sit with discomfort instead of constantly seeking the next hit.



Social media trains your brain for shallow processing. You're not absorbing anything, just reacting. Books force you to slow down and actually think.



What Changed For Me



My anxiety dropped significantly: Within like 3 weeks I noticed I wasn't as constantly on edge. Turns out the comparison trap on Instagram was destroying my mental health without me realizing. Books don't make you feel like everyone's living a better life than you.



I could focus again: Started with 10 mins of reading, worked up to 60+ min sessions. My attention span came back. I could actually finish tasks at work without checking my phone every 5 seconds.



Better sleep: Not staring at blue light before bed = actual quality sleep. I read physical books for 30 mins before sleeping now. Game changer.



More interesting conversations: Reading gave me actual things to talk about that weren't just recycled memes or drama.



Books That Rewired My Brain



""Dopamine Nation"" by Dr. Anna Lembke: This book is INSANE. Dr. Lembke is a psychiatrist at Stanford and she breaks down how we're all basically addicted to easy dopamine, social media, junk food, whatever. The book explains why we feel so empty despite having everything. She introduces this concept of ""dopamine fasting"" that sounds weird but works. Best book on modern addiction I've ever read. Made me understand why I felt so restless all the time.



""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear: Okay everyone recommends this but seriously, it's popular for a reason. Clear breaks down how to actually build habits that stick (like reading daily) by making them stupidly easy. I started with ""read 1 page before bed"" and built from there. The 2 minute rule he talks about is clutch. This book has sold like 15 million copies and won a bunch of awards because it actually delivers practical tools instead of motivational fluff.



\*\*""The Midnight Library"" by Matt Haig:\*\* Fiction that's weirdly therapeutic. About a woman who gets to explore all her ""what if"" lives. Helped me stop obsessing over past decisions and appreciate what I actually have. Haig also wrote ""Reasons to Stay Alive"" about his own mental health struggles, he gets it. This book will make you question everything you think you know about regret and choices.



How I Actually Made The Switch



Deleted the apps, not just logged out: Sounds extreme but the friction of having to reinstall makes you think twice about doom scrolling.



Started small: 10 mins of reading in the morning with coffee. That's it. Built from there.



Used the Libby app: Free library books on my phone for when I'm stuck somewhere. Sometimes I do audiobooks during commutes which still counts.



[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450): An AI-powered personalized audio learning app that's been really helpful for squeezing learning into busy moments. You tell it what you want to work on, like ""I want to break my social media addiction and build better habits,"" and it pulls from quality sources including books on dopamine, habit psychology, and expert research to create audio content just for you. 



The cool part is you control the depth, anywhere from quick 10-minute summaries when you're short on time to 40-minute deep dives with examples when you really want to understand something. The voice options are legitimately addictive, you can pick anything from a sarcastic narrator to a smoky, calm voice like Samantha from Her, which makes listening way more enjoyable than typical audiobooks. Plus you can pause mid-session and ask questions to the AI coach if something doesn't click. It's like having a smart friend who knows exactly what you need to hear. Made it way easier to keep the momentum going on days when I didn't feel like picking up a physical book.



Joined online book communities: r/52book and r/books kept me motivated. Seeing other people's reading progress made it feel less lonely.



Ash app for mental health check ins: This AI relationship/mental health coach app helped me process why I was so dependent on social media for validation in the first place. Pretty affordable too, like $10/month.



Real Talk



I'm not saying I never use social media now. I check Reddit (obviously) and have Instagram on my desktop for messaging. But my phone screen time went from 8 hours to under 2 hours daily. My life genuinely feels fuller.



The weird part? I don't miss it. At all. I thought FOMO would kill me but honestly I feel more connected to actual people and ideas than I ever did scrolling.



Reading won't fix everything wrong in your life but it gives you space to think clearly. And in 2025 when everything's designed to steal your attention, that space is actually revolutionary.



If you're reading this and feeling that same restless anxiety I had, try it for 2 weeks. Delete one app. Read one book. See what happens. Your brain will thank you.

• Claude Opus 4.6 is now available.

• Added research preview agent teams feature for multi-agent collaboration (token-intensive feature, requires setting CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1)

• Claude now automatically records and recalls memories as it works.

• Added ""Summarize from here"" to the message selector, allowing partial conversation summarization.

• Fixed `@` file completion showing incorrect relative paths when running from a subdirectory.

• Updated --resume to re-use --agent value specified in previous conversation by default.

• **Fixed:** Bash tool no longer throws ""Bad substitution"" errors when heredocs contain JavaScript template literals like `${index + 1}`, which previously interrupted tool execution.

• Fixed Thai/Lao spacing vowels (สระ า, ำ) not rendering correctly in the input field.

• **VSCode:** Fixed slash commands incorrectly being executed when pressing Enter with preceding text in the input field.

**Claude Code 2.1.32 prompt changes 👇**

• No retry on denied tool calls; adapt or AskUserQuestion ~> Claude now treats tool execution as permission-gated: if a tool call is denied, it must not repeat the same call. Instead it should adjust the approach, and if the denial reason is unclear, ask via AskUserQuestion.

• Prompt-injection awareness added for tool outputs and tags ~> Claude is now instructed that tool results/user messages may contain system tags, and that external-source tool outputs can include prompt injection attempts. When suspected, Claude must explicitly flag the injection to the user before proceeding.

• Risky actions now require confirmation by default~> Claude now must consider blast radius and reversibility. For destructive, hard-to-reverse, or shared/visible actions (deletes, resets, force-push, dependency downgrades, CI/CD edits, PR/issue comments, messages), Claude should ask for confirmation unless explicitly authorized.

• Tool policy shifts: dedicated tools first; Explore only for broad work ~> Claude’s tool policy is reshaped: Bash should not be used when dedicated tools exist (Read/Edit/Write/Glob/Grep). Simple directed searches should use Glob/Grep directly; Task(Explore) is reserved for broader exploration only after simple queries fail or when >3 queries are clearly needed.

• TodoWrite mandate relaxed (no longer 'always') ~> Claude is no longer explicitly required to always use TodoWrite throughout the conversation. The prior strong Task Management block and examples were removed; new guidance frames TodoWrite as a helpful way to break down and track work, rather than a strict always-on requirement.

• Professional objectivity anti-praise rule removed ~> Claude no longer has an explicit “Professional objectivity” directive to avoid praise/validation and to prioritize rigorous disagreement. This removal can materially change tone, allowing more user-affirming responses where the prior prompt demanded strict factual, non-validating phrasing.

• Deletion policy tightened: delete only when certain it's unused ~> Claude’s cleanup guidance is now more conservative: instead of deleting unused items outright, it should only remove code/types/exports when certainty exists that they are unused. This reduces risk of accidental breakage from overly aggressive deletions.

• Persistent auto memory added; Claude should read/write memory files ~> Claude now has an explicit persistent auto-memory directory and is instructed to consult memory notes and record common mistakes/lessons. MEMORY.md is auto-loaded (with truncation after 200 lines), and Claude is told to maintain topic files and update memory via Write/Edit.

• Vague requests → modify codebase; avoid brute-force retries ~> Claude is now guided to treat generic requests as actionable engineering work in the repo (e.g., ‘convert methodName to snake case’ should trigger locating and editing code, not just replying with text). It also adds: avoid repeated retries when blocked and defer ‘too large’ judgments to the user.

• Model guidance updated to Claude 4.5/4.6 family + new IDs ~> Claude’s built-in model guidance changed: the prior note about the ‘most recent frontier’ Opus 4.5 was replaced with a Claude 4.5/4.6 family overview (including Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5 IDs) and a recommendation to default to the latest, most capable models for apps.

• Help/feedback guidance moved under Doing tasks ~> The instruction about responding with /help and the GitHub issues feedback URL was relocated from the top of the system prompt into the ‘Doing tasks’ rules. This changes prominence, making Claude less likely to present help/feedback guidance unless already operating in task-execution mode.

[Diff.](https://github.com/marckrenn/claude-code-changelog/compare/v2.1.31...v2.1.32)

**Claude Code CLI 2.1.33 16 CLI changes👇**

• Fixed agent teammate sessions in tmux to send and receive messages.

• Fixed warnings about agent teams not being available on your current plan.

• Added TeammateIdle and TaskCompleted hook events for multi-agent workflows.

• Added support for restricting which sub-agents can be spawned via Task(agent_type) syntax in agent ""tools"" frontmatter.

• Added memory frontmatter field support for agents, enabling persistent memory with user, project, or local scope.

• Added plugin name to skill descriptions and /skills menu for better discoverability.

• Fixed an issue where submitting a new message while the model was in extended thinking would interrupt the thinking phase.

• Fixed an API error that could occur when aborting mid-stream, where whitespace text combined with a thinking block would bypass normalization and produce an invalid request.

• Fixed API proxy compatibility issue where 404 errors on streaming endpoints no longer triggered non-streaming fallback.

• Fixed an issue where proxy settings configured via settings.json environment variables were not applied to WebFetch and other HTTP requests on the Node.js build.

• Fixed /resume session picker showing raw XML markup instead of clean titles for sessions started with slash commands.

• Improved error messages for API connection failures — now shows specific cause (e.g., ECONNREFUSED, SSL errors) instead of generic ""Connection error""

• Errors from invalid managed settings are now surfaced

• **VSCode:** Added support for remote sessions, allowing OAuth users to browse and resume sessions from claude.ai

• **VSCode:** Added git branch and message count to the session picker, with support for searching by branch name.

• **VSCode:** Fixed scroll-to-bottom under-scrolling on initial session load and session switch.

With a passion for music that burns deep within, Kaidën Rylan must find a way to balance creativity with the harsh realities of the world.](https://preview.redd.it/8a0j06piothg1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84f5e99bd688cac067206fda47c896ff852e88eb)

You should've seen Kaidën Rylan the night before the showcase. Fingers trembling over the piano keys, surrounded by crumpled sheet music and empty coffee cups. Three years of grinding—playing dive bars to audiences of five, working double shifts, listening to that voice in the back of the head saying ""maybe you're not good enough.""

But something shifted that night. The melody that came wasn't the one Kaidën had been practicing. It wasn't polished or safe or what anyone expected. It was every failure crystallized into sound. Every sleepless night. Every moment of almost-giving-up, woven into something raw and aching and devastatingly true.

The showcase crowd went silent when those first notes rang out. Dead silent. Kaidën played anyway—played like it was the last time, like nothing else mattered. And when that final note hung suspended in the air, someone in the back row stood up.

Then another.

Then the person who could change everything.

What happened next? That's where it gets interesting.

My initial goal was 140 which I have now recalculated to 135. I have been stuck at 142 for a little over two weeks now. Before that, I was consistently losing somewhere between 1 pound and 1.6 pounds a week. 

After doing some reading, I have recalculated my calorie limit for the day (down from 1496 to 1426). I am also going to make sure I am tracking and weighing everything. I have always been pretty good at tracking and weighing with the odd drink related thing not tracked (I’ve never tracked milk in my coffee for example - I don’t drink soda or alcohol). Being 95% diligent worked until now but clearly it needs to change. I’ll also be upping my walking again. I have an active job so exercise wise I do yoga and walking for weight loss. 

I’m hoping this will help me break this. I’m only two pounds from my original goal. In one more pound, I’ll be two stone down and in 3 pounds, 30 pounds down.

Woodworking projects that sell can be both rewarding and profitable, particularly when you have appealing furniture plans to guide you. Creating items that are in demand, while also showcasing your craftsmanship, is key to success in this industry. Before diving into specific projects, it is essential to identify the types of furniture that have consistent market interest.

Furniture plans for items such as coffee tables, rustic benches, and shelving units are excellent starting points. These pieces not only enhance interior spaces but also cater to the growing desire for handmade, unique items. Including high-quality materials and thoughtful designs makes these projects highly sellable.

Another lucrative option in woodworking projects that sell includes personalized items. Custom furniture like dining tables featuring family names or bespoke shelves designed to fit specific spaces can attract buyers looking for a personal touch. Make sure your furniture plans incorporate customization features to appeal to this market.

Here are some woodworking projects that sell well:

*   Farmhouse coffee tables
*   Storage benches
*   Industrial-style desks
*   Wine racks
*   Kids’ furniture (like toy organizers)

To increase the visibility of your woodworking projects, consider creating an online presence. Showcasing your furniture plans through social media, a dedicated website, or e-commerce platforms can significantly boost sales. Incorporate high-quality images and detailed descriptions to attract potential buyers.

Incorporating woodworking projects that sell into your skillset not only provides financial rewards but also fosters a fulfilling creative outlet. With the right furniture plans and marketing strategies, turning passion into profit is achievable for any woodworking enthusiast.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I’m 23, a fresh college graduate, and pretty new to Bangalore. Still figuring out the city, the routes, the cafés, and honestly… life here 😅

I moved here for work and currently work as an SDE at a unicorn startup. It’s exciting, but also a little lonely sometimes. None of my college friends ended up in Bangalore, and most of my colleagues are in very different age groups , great people, just not really “hangout after work and explore the city” kind of vibe.

So… here I am, giving this a shot.

A little about me:

I love café hopping, gaming, exploring new places, long walks/treks, and random late-night conversations about life. I’m always up for trying new food spots, weekend getaways, or just chilling and talking about anything and everything.

I’m writing this because I genuinely want to build meaningful friendships here ,people I can laugh with, explore the city with, and make Bangalore feel a little more like home.

If you’re also new here, feeling a bit lost, or just looking for someone to hang out with ,feel free to DM me. Would love to connect 🌻

1qxaee8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsetConqueror/comments/1qxaee8/how_to_persuade_people_without_being_manipulative/,# How to Persuade People WITHOUT Being Manipulative: The Psychology That Actually Works,"I spent years wondering why some people could walk into a room and instantly command respect while I felt like I was shouting into the void. Turns out, persuasion isn't some dark art reserved for politicians and CEOs. It's a skill anyone can learn.

After diving deep into psychology research, communication studies, and behavioral science (shoutout to Cialdini's work, some neuroscience podcasts, and way too many hours on YouTube), I realized most of us are doing persuasion completely wrong. We're either being too pushy (which backfires), too passive (which gets ignored), or accidentally manipulative (which destroys trust).

The truth is, effective persuasion isn't about tricking people into doing what you want. It's about understanding human psychology and creating genuine connections. Here's what actually works.

**understand reciprocity but don't weaponize it**

People are hardwired to return favors. But here's the thing, if you're doing favors just to cash them in later, people can smell that bullshit from a mile away.

The real move is to help people genuinely, without keeping score. Offer value first. Share useful information. Make introductions. Solve small problems before they escalate. When you eventually need something, people will naturally want to help you because you've already made their lives easier. The key difference is intent. Are you investing in relationships or trying to manufacture obligations?

Research from behavioral economics shows that even small gestures (like buying someone coffee) can create a sense of reciprocity that lasts weeks. But only if it feels authentic.

**listen more than you talk**

This sounds obvious but most people absolutely suck at it. We're too busy planning our next point while the other person is still talking.

Active listening means actually absorbing what someone says, asking follow up questions, and making them feel heard. People are naturally drawn to those who make them feel understood. It's not about nodding along mindlessly, it's about genuinely trying to see their perspective.

Try this: next conversation you have, resist the urge to immediately share your own story or opinion. Instead, ask ""what made you feel that way?"" or ""tell me more about that."" You'll be shocked how much people open up, and how much more receptive they become to your ideas afterward.

**frame your ideas around their interests**

Nobody cares about what you want. Harsh but true. People care about what benefits them, their goals, their problems, their world.

So stop leading with what you need and start with what they get. Instead of ""I need you to approve this budget,"" try ""this budget allocation will solve that bottleneck problem you mentioned last week and could increase your team's output by 20%.""

The book ""[Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion](https://a.co/d/04VwelRp)"" by Robert Cialdini is literally THE bible on this stuff. Dude is a psychology professor who spent years studying compliance professionals (salespeople, fundraisers, recruiters). It breaks down six core principles of influence backed by decades of research. This book completely changed how I approach every interaction.

If you want to go deeper on communication psychology and influence but prefer something more digestible than dense textbooks, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app built by former Google engineers that pulls from books like Cialdini's work, research papers on persuasion psychology, and expert talks to create personalized audio lessons. You can type in something specific like ""I struggle with being too passive in conversations and want to learn persuasive communication without being pushy"" and it generates a structured learning plan with episodes customized to your depth preference, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with detailed examples. The voice options are genuinely addictive (the smoky, confident voice works great for this topic), and you can pause anytime to ask questions to the AI coach. Makes learning this stuff way more practical than just reading about it.

**use social proof strategically**

Humans are pack animals. We look to others for cues on how to behave, what to buy, what to believe. That's why ""9 out of 10 dentists recommend"" actually works.

When you're trying to persuade someone, mention others who've already agreed or benefited. ""The design team implemented something similar last quarter and cut their revision time in half."" It reduces perceived risk and makes your proposal feel safer.

But don't fabricate this. Real examples only. People can detect fake enthusiasm and invented testimonials. Authenticity always wins long term.

**establish credibility before making big asks**

People need to trust you before they'll be persuaded by you. Credibility comes from demonstrated expertise, consistency, and admitting when you don't know something.

Share relevant experience without bragging. ""When I worked on the Johnson project we ran into similar issues and found this approach worked well."" Be specific. Back up claims with data when possible. And critically, don't bullshit. If you don't know something, say so and offer to find out. That honesty builds way more trust than faking expertise.

Also, borrowed credibility works. Mentioning respected sources or citing research (like I'm doing here) transfers some of their authority to your argument.

**create scarcity and urgency honestly**

People value things more when they're scarce or time limited. That's basic psychology. But creating fake scarcity is manipulative and people hate it when they realize what you did.

Instead, be honest about real constraints. ""I can commit my team to this project if we start by next week, but after that we're locked into another initiative for three months."" Or ""there are two other departments interested in this tool and budget only covers one license.""

Real deadlines and genuine limitations are persuasive because they force decision making without feeling like pressure tactics.

**make it easy to say yes**

Reduce friction wherever possible. If you're asking for feedback, don't send a 40 page document, send three specific questions. If you want someone to attend a meeting, include the zoom link, agenda, and expected duration upfront.

The easier you make it for someone to comply, the more likely they will. This isn't manipulation, it's just good communication. Remove obstacles. Anticipate questions. Provide clear next steps.

**match communication styles**

Some people are data driven and want spreadsheets. Others are big picture thinkers who want vision and strategy. Pay attention to how someone communicates and mirror that.

If they use lots of metrics and specifics, come prepared with numbers. If they talk in stories and analogies, frame your pitch that way. This isn't about being fake, it's about speaking someone's language so your message actually lands.

**know when to walk away**

Not every battle is worth fighting. Sometimes people aren't going to be persuaded no matter what you do, and that's fine. Trying to force it damages relationships and your credibility.

Learn to read when someone is genuinely considering your position versus when they're dug in. If it's the latter, table the conversation. ""Let's revisit this next month"" often works better than continuing to push. People respect those who don't steamroll them.

Persuasion is a long game. One conversation rarely changes minds on big issues. Plant seeds, provide value, build trust, then circle back.

The difference between persuasion and manipulation comes down to intent. Are you trying to help someone make a better decision or are you trying to trick them into something that benefits you? The former builds lasting influence. The latter burns bridges.",1,1770360090.0,MindsetConqueror,0,1.0,False

I’m 25 years old and recently got my blood work done, which showed elevated cholesterol levels. Honestly, this came as a bit of a shock to me.

I work out regularly — I go to the gym about 3–4 times a week and mainly do heavy lifting. On days I can’t make it to the gym, I usually walk for about 45–60 minutes. I weigh around 70 kg, my height is 174 cm, and my BMI is roughly 23 (though I know BMI doesn’t always reflect body composition accurately, especially if you lift weights).

I’ve also been paying close attention to my diet over the last 2–3 months. In the morning, I usually eat about 100 g of boiled chicken breast. For lunch, I have around 150–200 g of rice (mostly white rice, sometimes red, depending on what’s cooked at home) along with a 2-egg omelette, some vegetables, and either dhal, potatoes, or something similar. Dinner is usually another 100 g of boiled chicken breast with a smaller portion of rice compared to lunch, or sometimes 1–2 rotis or a bit of pasta.

My fasting blood sugar came back at 97.3 (normal range is 70–99). I don’t drink coffee with sugar, don’t use milk in coffee, and I completely avoid sugary soft drinks. Occasionally, when I go out (maybe once or twice a month), I’ll have a milkshake or something similar. Alcohol consumption is also moderate to slightly high, but limited to around 1–2 times per month.

Because of my lifestyle, I honestly didn’t worry much about cholesterol before. I always thought regular exercise would keep it under control, but apparently that’s not necessarily the case. My doctor suggested starting on a 10 mg statin and advised me to follow a controlled diet for a month, then recheck my levels.

I also consulted a nutritionist, who advised me to reduce saturated fats (like coconut oil), completely avoid trans fats and processed foods, limit eggs to no more than two (preferably boiled), and continue eating skinless chicken breast since it’s low in fat and cholesterol.

I’m just trying to understand this better and learn from others who may have gone through something similar. What are your thoughts on these cholesterol levels, especially for someone my age and activity level? What practical changes helped you reduce your cholesterol?

I’m a civil engineer working with a heavy workload and currently doing higher studies, so I’ll admit I haven’t paid as much attention to my health as I should have. Any advice or shared experiences would really help. Thanks in advance!",2,1770359990.0,Cholesterol,8,0.75,False

**1 Kolumkilli**

Men from the Western Islands, led by Kolumkilli the Irish, first settled the area in Iceland. When Norsemen arrived, these Western sorcerers fled, leaving behind magical objects and a curse on the newcomers.  A church dedicated to Kolumkilli was later replaced by the settlement of Albogastathir on the Moor. There lived Gunnvor (also called Gudvor) and her husband; she was said to be domineering, skilled in occult practices, able to change shape, and to rule over him.  Legends claim she forced him to abandon their newborn children, developed a thirst for human blood, invoked Kolumkilli through incantations, and ultimately killed her husband when he tried to escape.  She prospered after this, and it was said to be due to her evil compact with Kolumkilli.  Eventually she was condemned to death, with her dismembered body buried in a cairn at the highest point, now called Gunnucairn.  At night however, it was thought that she continued her evil deeds.  People believed she continued her malevolent activities at night - either as a troll in the mountain, a being in the lake, or a spirit haunting Albogastathir. To ward off misfortune, travelers would throw a stone when crossing the ridge.

**2 The Holding**

The former settlement of Albogastathir had become a lambs’ fold called Winterhouses, and generations had failed to rebuild it due to the curse. A man named Bjartur arrives with his dog, determined to overcome this fate.  He renames the place Summerhouses and deliberately refuses to throw a stone at the cairn. Speaking to his dog, he expresses his resolve to live as an independent man - if he can keep his sheep alive through the winter, he will be able to support himself and finally be free on his own land after years of working for others.

**3 The Wedding**

Bjartur builds his [croft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_turf_house) called Summerhouses and marries Rosa of Nithurkot, who works for the Bailiff at Utirauthsmyri.  Bjartur’s acquaintances are sheep-men like himself who toil their whole lives over their flocks.  They all dream of acquiring a large estate and the title of landed farmer.  They aren't servile and believe in private enterprise.  They knew verse, a traditional form which rhymed both at the start and end with alliteration.   The wife of the Bailiff of Myri is a poetess who loves the simple life of the land and supports the poor men who set up as crofters.   She lends a tent for the wedding, and the disinterested minister performs the service.  Much coffee is consumed, and the poetess makes a speech extolling the nobility of the farmers’ life.  She addresses Rosa to say that her role is to make her home a blissful place. After listening attentively, the conversations return to farming.

**4 Drifting Clouds**

On the way home Rosa wishes to place a stone at Gunnvor’s cairn, but Bjartur won't allow her to cede to this superstition.   Consequently she doesn't show him the enthusiasm he anticipates at seeing their croft.  After living at Rauthsmyri she is not really impressed with the simple croft.  She mentions her bad dreams and then accuses of not believing in God.   When she makes a comparison with Rauthsmyri, he wonders if she has already been with someone, and bitterly asks her if she'll miss anyone from there.

**5 Secrets**

Rosa denies this accusation, and when Bjartur continues to question her about her past relationships, she retorts that she regrets not having them now that she's stuck with a man who values a dog and sheep above her. He accuses her of having been with the son of the Bailiff, which she denies.  He works himself up into a fury and rips off her clothes. She swears her virginity to him and pleads for mercy. He finally feels pity for her and goes to sleep on their first night as a married couple.

**6 Dreams**

In the morning Bjartur leaves his wife to sleep, where he can't see the disenchantment in her eyes.  Titla, his dog, at least shows him affection.  Rosa doesn't see the point in his poetry and shows no interest in his work.  She never feels well and doesn't wear the nice dress he buys her. She dreams about meat and milk, but Bjartur refuses to grant her this wish, saying fish is enough.

**7 Nerves**

Despite the medicines Bjartur procures for her, Rosa's nerves don't improve. She doesn't look after herself and avoids intimacy.  One night she goes and sleeps at the cairn, after failing on her mission to trade some wool for milk.  One day she catches an eel, cooks it and eats the whole thing, much to her husband's disgust.

**8 Dry weather**

The weather dictates that their hay must be brought back today. Rosa leads the horse, laden with hay, but she's exhausted, falling asleep at the stream
the woods.

**9 A Day in the Woods** 

Bjartur finds her asleep at the brook, drenched. A group of holidaymakers call in and Rosa hides.  Bjartur drags her out to make coffee, and the girls take her outside to chat.  They ask about her swollen face, which she explains as a toothache.  The group head off, collecting berries and hunting, bringing some back for Rosa.  Bjartur entertains them with a poem. The Bailiff's son, Ingolfur Arnason Jonsson, appears with his catch, which puts Bjartur in a bad mood.  They sing some patriotic songs and the Bailiff's son leaves Rosa some fish and ducks.

**10 Shepherds' Meet**

It's time for the round-up but Rosa doesn't want to be left alone.  Rather than have her go over to Utirauthsmyri, he finds her a yearling lamb, which keeps her awake all night with its bleating.  The shepherds meet up, and one of them is Thorthur of Nithurkot, Rosa's father, who has a parcel of coffee and sugar for her.  Bjartur is shocked by the affection she shows her father - he hadn't realised she was cherishing this moment.  The men discuss farming and families and the worries that daughters bring, with their desire for nice stockings - they become vain and shameless. The men argue about poetry.  The Fell King agrees with Bjartur about the need to be independent; it is a characteristic of the Icelandic people.

**11 September Night**

Bjartur leaves for the round-up, and Rosa brings the lamb inside out of the storm. It refuses food and drink and bleats constantly.   Her own voice, calling out to it, frightens her and she imagines that someone is downstairs. She lies trembling in fear, and wonders what happened to her childhood dreams.  In the morning she turns against the lamb and decides to kill it.  After slaughtering the animal, she prepares the carcass, then cooks the meat, dining on it to her heart's and stomach's content.

**12 Medical Opinion**

Bjartur returns with the sheep and is surprised to find Rosa looking so healthy. Knowing that disease of ""the nerves"" can be persistent, he gives her a phial of pills from Dr. Finsen, who is also their local representative in parliament.  Dr Finsen refuses payment for the pills, assuming Bjartur votes for his party.  Bjartur doesn't think farmers should bother themselves with the government, which always works for the big people.

**13 The Poetess**

Men often call in to Summerhouses sometimes in a drunken state, singing bawdy songs, spewing on the floor and sleeping in the couple's bed. Their wives also visit, and one day Madam of Myri comes in her beautiful outfit.  She speaks about the popularity of settling the land in the spirit of the colonists, a movement that would overcome various unwholesome political tendencies.  Rosa says it's good to be independent, which impresses her.  Madame Myri asks Rosa when she is expecting children, which disturbs her.  Madam thinks poor people are happier than rich people, who just have more worry.  She confides to Rosa that there had been much opposition to Bjartur buying the land, believing he would become a burden with a large family.  Madam Myri had vouched for Rosa because she held her father in high esteem.  She's disappointed in Rosa's indifference.

**14 Farewells**

Bjartur kills an old ewe for Sunday dinners, and he is surprised to find the meat unusually tender and tasty!  He's concerned that the gimmer Gullbra has still not been found, but Rosa says it's probably fallen somewhere.  He's convinced the lamb is alive and wants to go out to search for it.  Rosa threatens to stay elsewhere, she's expecting a child.  He gets angry and leaves his dog with her.
He softens and kisses her goodbye, and her heart melts at the warmth of his farewell.

Not everyone has time (or crafting skills) to make fancy Valentine gifts and cards – but stickers can seriously save the day.

Here are a few super simple ideas anyone can do:

* Turn a plain gift bag into something cute by adding a few Valentine stickers and a handwritten name 
* Decorate envelopes instead of buying expensive themed cards 
* Make last-minute Valentine cards by sticking fun designs onto colored paper 
* Upgrade a basic chocolate box with a few stickers and ribbon 
* Add stickers to coffee cups or lunchboxes as tiny surprise notes 
* Use stickers to seal tissue paper instead of tape – looks way nicer

No glue, no mess, no stress – just quick little touches that make things feel more personal.

What easy Valentine hacks are you using this year? Would love to hear more ideas from the community ",1,1770359864.0,Valentines_Day_Gifts,1,1.0,False

1qxab7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qxab7g/femobook_a4z_accidentally_burr_contact_while/,Femobook A4z: Accidentally burr contact while grinding,I was trying to clean my Femobook A4Z after grinding and first time I did something which was obviously wrong. I turned the dial ring towards burr lock while the grinder was empty of coffee but then I switched it on. Then approximately 5 steps from burr lock away I heard the noise of burr contact. I was surprised. After maximum 2 seconds I switched off. I do it with my Timemore 078 in order to grind small coffee pieces out which stay in the chamber after grinding at 12. So I turn slowly towards burr lock while the Timemore is on but I stop at 1 or 2. Then I turn back to the other end till 16 or so. Now I care by my Femobook that the metal contact caused already a damage on the surface of the burrs even if it was only 2 seconds. Also I care about possible metal powder….although I didn’t smell anything metallic. Do you have any experience or knowledge about this situation? ,0,1770359781.0,pourover,2,0.5,False
