1j1pksf,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1j1pksf/my_sugar_baby_is_proof_that_platonic_sugar_babies/,My sugar baby is proof that platonic sugar babies exist.,"Look, I know most on here think it's impossible. But a platonic sugar baby does exist. We'll call her A. I bought her a house, I pay for the lease on her car (that she chose), I pay for her vacations, and I give her a generous allowance. I regularly buy her gifts, and I tell her how lucky I am to have her at least weekly. And no, we have never had sex. We have never done anything sexual. It is a loving, platonic relationship where she is given whatever she asks for, and much more because she is selfless.

Because she's my mom. And my mom is awesome. And she snorted coffee through her nose today when I said she was my platonic sugar baby. But this post proves they do exist. So don't give up hope, ladies! In 31 years, your son might grow up to be the platonic sugar daddy you're looking for! Be patient. ",0,1740917799.0,sugarlifestyleforum,0,0.5,False

I’m planning a short trip to Dubai and wanted to get your thoughts on my itinerary. I’ll be in the city for 2.5 days, so I’m trying to make the most of the limited time. My wife and I will be traveling with an infant and we're not too keen on seeing the usual tourist locations. We will skip Burj Khalifa, Dubai Frame etc. Here's what I've planned so far:

# Day 1:

* **Half-day**: Roam around **Dubai Mall** and catch the **Fountain Show**. Looking forward to seeing the mall and the fountains, but wondering if there are any spots nearby that offer a better view or unique experience?

# Day 2:

* **Morning**: Shopping at **Meena Bazaar** and exploring the **Old City (Al Seef).** 
* **Afternoon:** The second part of the day will be spent exploring Miracle garden and Global village.

# Day 3:

* **Morning**: Doing the **Edge Walk** for some thrill and city views. 
* **Afternoon**: Desert Safari. If anyone has any recommendations for specific desert safari companies or tips for making the most of it, I’d love to hear!

  
**TLDR;  Questions:**

* **Cafe with Fountain Show View**: Any recommendations on where to get a good view and a nice cup of coffee or meal while enjoying the Dubai mall fountain show?
* **Meena Bazaar for PlayStation 5**: Is Meena Bazaar a good place to buy a PlayStation 5? If so, do you have any specific stores that are known to be reliable for electronics? 
* Desert safari: Since we will be traveling during Ramadan, will the desert safaris be operational and also, if there are any recommendations for good organizers, please share them. 

Thanks in advance for your help! I’m really looking forward to any insights or suggestions.",1,1740917202.0,dubai,2,1.0,False

I found a lump in my left breast..with some research I've discovered it's in the upper outer quadrant. This is new (within the last week). I examed it super well because I have terrible health anxiety and spent 6 hours on Reddit reading breast cancer stories, symptoms, diagnoses. I cried for 5/6 hours of that time. I laid in bed until from 6-1am crying. I have a two year old and six year old and am so scared. I know someone who just died from BC and left behind kids a similar age. Scared is an understatement. Please please just reassure me.

I understand 80% or higher of all lumps tend to be benign. The lump isn't small, not pea sized, almost feels like a small golf ball or boiled egg size. If I try to pick it up I can literally lift it up and move it around. It feels like it's just in the breast tissue and not fixed to anything. It's become a little more prominent to feel now if I just rub my boob where as before I messed with it I really had to squeeze my boob to feel it. It's not painful but also not painless. A little discomfort. 

I'm about 10 or so days post ovulation and period is due in 9 days for context. I'm very petite, usually hang around 110-115lbs so my boobs are small (even smaller/deflated after 9 months of breastfeeding my first and two years of breastfeeding my second. No prior health issues. Dr. Does a manual breast exam once a year. I do drink 1-2 cops of coffee each morning, this is somewhat new... I only started drinking coffee maybe last Autumn so if this is common with caffeine use I have no problem stopping.. I'll probably actually start today

No other symptoms. No burning, no skin changes, no nipple changes, no discharge...maybe a little tingling in both but this happened during an anxiety episode and I tend to get tingly everywhere when I'm super anxious..I have a dr appt booked 5 days from now (for my annual well woman exam) but just emailed him and asked if he can squeeze me in tomorrow because I'm not sure my health anxiety can handle waiting a week...so we will see...if not I may drive myself to the ER for peace of mind because I can hardly function right now. I'm so inside of my head, reading about symptoms, looking at diagnostic scans. I've never had a lump in my breast before. My maternal grandmother had BC... I don't know the details but I know she had a mastectomy and is ok now, in her late 70s probably, close to 80.

Anyways

I’ve been posting a lot about RedCoffee here lately, and I just want to take a moment to say thank you. The support from this community has been incredible, and as the title suggests, I’m excited to share that RedCoffee has now crossed 8,000 downloads.

I know it’s not a huge number, but for an indie developer, this means a lot. It gives me confidence that I’m building something useful. To be honest, the past few months have been rough personally, but this project has kept me motivated and pushing forward.

For those who haven’t come across it before, RedCoffee is a CLI tool that generates PDF reports for SonarQube Community Edition analysis. Since SonarQube CE doesn’t provide a built-in way to export reports, I ran into this issue myself and decided to solve it. What started as a simple fix for my own workflow is now being used by teams across different places, which is honestly pretty amazing to see.

# What Does the Project Do?

Put simply, RedCoffee helps developers generate insightful PDF reports from SonarQube Community Edition analysis results. It’s a small tool but fills a much-needed gap for teams that rely on SonarQube CE.

I get that this is a very niche problem, but for those who need it, it makes life a lot easier.

# Latest Updates

I just released RedCoffee v2.2, and here are the two biggest updates:

*1. Sentry Integration for Monitoring Failures*

I’ve now integrated Sentry to monitor exceptions and track success/failure events. This was actually a learning moment for me since I hadn’t worked directly with Sentry before.

The reason behind this? A user from this sub reached out saying they were getting a 401 error, and I had no way to debug it because all logs were on their side. Someone suggested Sentry, and while it’s not a perfect fix, it at least gives me visibility into failures, so I can work on improving things.

*2. Test Coverage Using Docker & WireMock*

One of my biggest pain points was lack of proper test coverage. Decided to finally tackle it and found a solid approach using Docker & WireMock.

* I spin up a WireMock container in Docker.
* I mount the required files & mapping directory into the container.
* This lets me mock request/response interactions and write proper unit tests.

Still a work in progress, but it’s a big step forward. Hoping to wrap this up soon!

  
**Upgrade to Latest version**

I would please request to upgrade to the latest version of RedCoffee which is v2.2 . While v1.1 remains the LTS and v1.8 the most popular version, v2.2 comes with changes that would make this tool more useable.  
Here is the command to install RedCoffee v2.2

    pip install redcoffee==2.2

# 

# Target Audience

* Small teams using SonarQube CE who need a quick way to generate and share reports.
* Developers interested in SonarQube and looking to extend its capabilities.
* Anyone curious about Sentry, since v2.2 now includes it for monitoring.
* QAs & Engineers who want to learn Docker-WireMock integration for writing better unit tests.

**A Humble Request**

If you like this tool or you found this project to be useful , can you please star the Github repository ? The link for the same is available in the next section.

1j1pat4,https://v.redd.it/hgrgfvrcn9me1,"Update: Yogg Saron passed away last night, peacefully on my lap. I'd like to thank you all for your kind messages.","Not gonna lie, I feel quite empty right now. Looking for a video of him to post, it was quite surprising for me to see how fluffy he used to be. I had gotten used to see his less healthy appearance. I'd like to thank you all for the kind messages on my post yesterday, they brought me comfort as I waited for the inevitable. Sorry for the long text, you don't have to read it, I just want to vent a little.

About six months after I got him, he started showing symptoms that looked like wet tail or maybe just diarrhea. I took him to the vet but all the exams were normal, as if he was just like that. And indeed, it didn't change his habits very much, nor did it ever go away. It made caring for him much more of a hassle than with a regular hamster because it required a lot more cleaning, but that never upset me. It clearly had some effects on him though, he became very incompetent at same bathing, although he tried, and his fur became less fluffy with time. A second veterinarian gave the same results, so I just accepted it. I work from home and usually go for weeks without seeing people (and even then I only see work people) so he was my only company. As some of you may remember, he was also full time free roaming and my studio is more adapted to him than to me (I spend most of my time on my PC) and it was so interesting to see him changing nests from time to time. Now there are reminders of him everywhere and it feels weird to think he won't be running to my feet when I'm making coffee in the morning. 

A few days after I moved to the studio upstairs, I noticed a growth on his ear. The veterinarian confirmed it was a tumor forming but said it was too early for a surgery as it reached the bones out something and would come back and require another again and again. I was struggling financially at the time so I decided to wait. It didn't change for a while so I just kept cleaning the wound on his ear and once it grew again, he has it removed, but just as expected it started growing in the same place. At that point, his other problem got worse and required more care, it also made him walk very funny with his legs stretched. He was clearly struggling and I imagine he was in pain all the time, but rather than being slow and lethargic, he kept going as usual. His night walks and explorations, running on his wheels, eating and changing nests. It was amazing to see, but also kinda sad because he clearly just wanted to keep living even though his body was dwindling. This went on for over three months, which surprises me a lot since they're such fragile creatures. He lost a lot of weight, his fur became more unraveled, but his energy and his spirit were there to the very end. 

Yesterday, even though he was so weak he could barely stand, he kept trying to walk from time to time and would only be calm when resting on my hand. I held him for the whole day and he passed away very peacefully. He was a great hamster and I hope to one day have at least half of the strength and resilience he had, to keep going and trying to live as fully as I can no matter what.

Rest now, Yogg Saron, your struggles and suffering are over. You were a great pal and will be sorely missed. ",4,1740916765.0,hamsters,1,1.0,False

1j1p61u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eutychus/comments/1j1p61u/if_it_were_some_wrong_or_some_wicked_act_of/,“If it Were Some Wrong or Some Wicked Act of Villainy”,"Sometimes a guy prefers the older translation to the newer one. Like with this passage from Acts 18:14, when the Jewish bigwigs hauled Paul before the proconsul because he was teaching new things: “Contrary to the law this person leads men to another persuasion in worshiping God,” they charged, as though it was a crime. (vs 13)

It was a crime, according to their rules but the Roman proconsul Gallio could not have cared less. These people with their religious disputes were such a pain to him that he kept clear. He answers them, just before Paul is going to defend himself, and thereby making defense unnecessary, “If it were, indeed, some wrong or a wicked act of villainy, O Jews, I would with reason put up patiently with you.  But if it is controversies over speech and names and the law among you, you yourselves must see to it. I do not wish to be a judge of these things.” (14-15)

You can read the contempt. It oozes from the guy’s mouth. If he had to (it wouldn’t be easy and he wouldn’t like the task), he would “put up patiently” with these characters. If this fellow Paul had actually done something “wrong” or—is it sarcasm here?—done some “wicked act of villainy,” he’d hear them out. But he hasn’t! So—‘Sheesh! won’t you leave me in peace already?’ you can almost hear his dismissal.

The new 2013 NWT version misses that entirely. Here, Gallio is just the earnest county official: He says, “If, indeed, it were some wrong or a serious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to hear you out patiently.” Yes, that rendering gets the job done. It conveys that he’s not going to get involved. But, it’s not as good. It doesn’t convey how he feels about his subjects. Sometimes we are so determined to paint people as mild that we paint them as bland.

So, when the Jews are ignored, they take to beating the snot out of the synagogue head honcho—surely that will get Gallio’s attention. ‘Nope—I’m done,’ is his response, and you can almost see him rustling his newspaper to shoo them away. We read, “But Gallio would not concern himself at all with these things.” (17)

That response is slightly modified, for the worse, I think, in the newer version which reads that he would not “get involved,” implying he may have been “concerned” but his hands were tied by it not being his affair—so what could he do? Nah, I think he didn’t give a hoot. The older (originally from 1961) is better.

Sigh—the wording from the new serves as the basis for Bearing Thorough Witness about God’s Kingdom, the current JW commentary on Acts of the Apostles. As to Gallio’s indifference, it suggests, “Perhaps Gallio thought that Sosthenes was the leader of the mob action against Paul and was therefore getting what he deserved.” I don’t think so; since that implies that he cared. I don’t think he did. He just wanted to get back to his paper and cup of coffee.

No, I do not like the new. It is going in the direction of the newer mushier translations, like the New International Version (1978), which reads: “Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to them, ‘If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you.’” (14)

It’s not as bad as the word-salad Message paraphrase (1993), which reads: “Just as Paul was about to defend himself, Gallio interrupted and said to the Jews, “If this was a matter of criminal conduct, I would gladly hear you out. But it sounds to me like one more Jewish squabble, another of your endless hairsplitting quarrels over religion. Take care of it on your own time. I can’t be bothered with this nonsense,”

“Gladly!” He would “gladly” hear them out! NO! They are a pain in the neck! He would, “with reason, put up patiently” with them. The older versions render it better*. Like the Revised Standard Version of 1952: “But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious crime, I should have reason to bear with you, O Jews.” It’s not quite as strong as the older NWT, but it does convey he wouldn’t relish the task.

Forget that verse about the codger who mutters, “Why were the old days better than the present ones?” (Ecclesiastes 7:10) I’ll tell you why he grumbles over that. Because, they were!!

*In fairness to the Message, it does convey that Gallio considered the Jews’ concerns “nonsense.”

For the convenience of new members to the Galactic Confederacy.



Foreword



Welcome to the Galactic Confederacy! Before you begin your official duties or receive any assistance as needed, a short orientation period is necessary. However, in case of emergency such as war, disaster or other such circumstances, you will receive aid immediately.



Regardless of circumstances, this document serves as a guide to the galaxy's most... eccentric member - Humans.



Humanity were the creators of the Confederacy. Initially they decided to try form a Federation of states of sorts, but differences in Galactic politics and resource logistics meant that system was not a viable option. So they created the Confederacy instead. We all operate under our own system of governance, with agreements for free trade and security for merchant fleets from pirates. Registration systems to prevent fraudsters and as you probably know by now - a universal criminal registry to protect the galaxy against ne'er do wells.



But one thing about humans? They're very eccentric... Strange... unpredictable. Some might even say insane. Be that as it may they have become an indispensable, immutable, unimaginably needed resource, and most would say, friend within the galactic community.



Also - for the more warmongering members of the galactic community, a fair warning. Humans have this thing where they have no sense of scale, no 'chill' and the engineering prowess to make this silliness a reality. They have BIGGER ships than you, more heavily armed ships than you, more ships than you in total and they WILL splatter your face across the sixteen vectors if you give them the reason to.



So please don't.



In any case, when it comes to humans they have these phrases, words and 'human-isms' that mean certain things in certain situations. Things, which when said, mean certain things. This glossary will tell you what to do in the event of such things being said. Without further ado, here they are:

  


Number One - Hold My Beer



Ultimately one of the most infamous phrases in human history, this phrase is often used when a human wishes to do something crazy or 'one-up' another individual. This phrase is a human's way of stating the fact he or she CAN and WILL do better than the thing they just saw.



This is generally considered a good thing, owing to varying circumstances. In the right circumstances, this can mean two engineers engaging in an interesting sparring match in which they are trying to beat each other in a 'build-off'. This usually means the galaxy has another glorious innovation of technology, or a really big (CENSORED)-off gun to use against the Confederacy's enemies.



OR it could be used as a reason for you to drop everything and RUN.



This is NOT: An invitation for you to actually hold the human's beer. Ask the Councillor from Hamaris IV who did that once... He regretted it.

This is NOT: An order for you to take the human's beer from him. The Great Marankis The Fifth from the Saranis Sector still has nightmares about that day.

This is NOT: An invitation for you to take the human's beer, and drink it, even in jest. You cannot ask the last guy who did that, as he can no longer speak.

  


Number Two - Don't Worry About It



This is one of the most terrifying phrases a human can say. This usually happens when something BAD is about to happen, is happening or has happened. This phrase is uttered during, before or after a disastrous event. This phrase was originally used by humans to lie to alien crew members in an attempt to calm or placate them in case of emergency. Then that human did something suicidally insane to stop the problem from being problematic. Usually to their detriment. And/or death.



When a human says to you 'don't worry about it' the first and ONLY thing you should do is:



Worry about it.



When you are finished worrying about it, say your last goodbyes to that human, you are likely not going to see them again. At least not alive anyway. The only good thing about this phrase and its subsequent utterance is that the problem it is in reference to, almost always (within a 98% margin) gets resolved, fixed or finished.

  


Number Three - Would



This is undoubtedly THE most dangerous thing a human can say, especially when they're looking at you. But not for the reason you think. But nowhere near as dangerous as the word 'WILL'. But also not for the reason you think. The reason for this is entirely due to humans and their erm... breeding habits.



Yes, exactly the opposite reason you think. Human reproduction is one of the most complicated systems ever discovered by sapient life. They have no 'off' switch, and WILL actively attempt, if possible, to bonk anything that tickles their fancy. Unlike most denizens of the galaxy, humans will engage in sexual activity for entertainment, and they have no seasonal fertility cycle.



The good news is, that humans themselves are quite.... delightful. They are perhaps the most appealing species to look at and be around. Natural body warmth, mammalian in nature, omnivorous, with symmetrical features. Sounds nice doesn't it?



There are two ways to handle the situation of a human looks at you and says 'Would'.



Option A - Reciprocate, and use the phrase 'I would too'. This depends on if you like the human in question.

Option B - As fast as you can ambulate, do so rapidly in any direction the human isn't. In short - run the hell away.

  


Number Four - Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time...



This phrase is usually uttered during the aftermath of an experiment gone wrong, a failure of engineering, or when a human builds an enormous weapon and it fails spectacularly. Or performs so well it accidentally kills a god.



And that last part did in fact happen. They did in fact, accidentally kill a god. They promised they wouldn't do it again.

  


Number Five - This'll Just Take A Sec



A phrase that essentially means a task will take either a few minutes to a few days to complete. Again one of those things that humans do to placate the people around them and calm everyone's fears down. The duration of this task can be, as stated, a few seconds, or up to a few days, depending on everything. The human will often repeat this phrase during the task if you ever ask him how it's going. And regardless of duration will usually follow up by stating 'See? I told you it would only take a sec!' even if the task took several weeks.

  


Number Six - This Is Going To Hurt



A phrase used before a serious incident, when the human’s capacity for momentary foresight and pattern recognition suddenly understands there's about to be a problem. Or, when a human is about to do something stupid, like jump off a roof, chase a tornado, get in front of an avalanche, or do something dangerous. It depends on the situation of course, but it can either mean the human who spoke it just warned you to take cover or retreat to safety, or as a cue for you to retrieve a First Aid Kit.



Upon hearing this phrase, first consider the context, then do the following:



Option A - If it's a stunt, a dangerous trick or some other leisure activity, shrug your shoulders (or analogue thereof) and retrieve a First Aid Kit. The human will need it.

Option B - If it's a dangerous situation like an industrial accident or some kind of explosive danger - RUN.

  


Number Seven - All That Is Certain In Life Is Death And Taxes



You don't really need to react when a human says this. We're just putting this here because... well it's true, isn't it?

  


Number Eight - Hear Me Out...



This phrase is often used by humans for the purposes of laying out their opinion on certain activities and political or religious standpoints.



The sane ones do that anyway.



The phrase 'Hear Me Out' when spoken by anyone other than the sane ones, usually precludes a human doing one of the following activities:



Using a cannon in an attempt to deep fry poultry.

Using large quantities of gasoline in an attempt to light a campfire.

Using a railgun launch mechanism to deliver mail.

Using a starship's main Gauss Laser to carve out a smiley face on the surface of a moon.

Using explosives to heat up army ration packs.

Or other things of that nature.



So... Be careful and consider present company when hearing this phrase. It could either be a reason for you to demand a cup of coffee as payment for a debate, or a reason for you to pray to the Gods.

  


Number Nine - Don't Push The Red Button



Human ships have this strange tradition of having a rather large, very obvious big red button somewhere on the ship. We have never understood why, or how, or even when this tradition started. But every single ship has somewhere in it, a big, fat, glowing red button.



DO NOT PRESS THIS BUTTON UNLESS EXPLICITLY DIRECTED TO DO SO BY A HUMAN.



This button has been pressed accidentally or out of curiosity before. Bad things happened. Such as:



Enabling the Nuclear warheads present on EVERY human ship.

Activating an automated security protocol that exterminates all non-registered crew members.

Activating the Self destruct sequence.

Activating the 'blow up a random star' cannon.

Enabling the shield system that prevents anyone from leaving the ship. Ever.

Enabling the time drive system that jumps the ship to the 1970s... for some reason.



Again, this button does a whole massive host of things. It varies ship to ship, crew to crew, sometimes even engineer to engineer. There can be multiple buttons on a ship, or just one very BIG button. We have no idea how or why these functions would even exist, let alone be installed inside a starship, but they are, and that big red button controls those mechanisms.



Please don't ask why. Not even they know.

  


Number Ten - I Wonder If It Tastes Like Chicken



This phrase is usually uttered when a human encounters unusual alien food, or some kind of foodstuff or edible while exploring a planet. This is normal. Human brains function abnormally compared to the rest of the galaxy, and often will understand something by experiencing it first. This usually ends badly, but not the way you think.



After numerous medical advances, humans can survive almost anything they ingest save lethal chemicals like cyanide or expended nuclear fuel. Of course they are intelligent enough to know NOT to do that. But it wont stop them from grabbing and munching on a random mushroom or berry off a bush. Humans usually carry a syringe around with them that allows them to get away with this.



I Wonder If It Tastes Like Chicken is basically a human's way of saying 'can I eat this' and then attempting to compare the flavour (if any) to a certain poultry that exists on their home world, Earth.



If a human says this, be prepared for copious quantities of vomiting, diarrhoea or gastrointestinal stress responses, shortly before the human jabs themselves with the aforementioned syringe.



We still don't know why... But when a human likes what they are eating, its a sign you've either stumbled on a new favourite food stuff, or something that will make the human happy, but will make you explode.



If a human ever offers you this if you are there to witness it upon them liking it, politely decline and state you are on a diet. This will get them to back off.

  


And that will be all for orientation! There is  a lot more obviously, but outlying the some odd two thousand phrases used by humans, would result in this orientation pamphlet being the size of a large seven hundred page novel.  We will let you get used to how things work on your own time.



We had to. Now you do too.

- haven't noticed a reward/bonus for making latte art patterns, which would help justify spending time on making it in the first place (it's fun, but doesn't feel rewarding enough)
- the cost for decor feels very unbalanced, it’s hard to afford anything, which, as well as the limited options, takes away the fun of decorating

If that is the case, you should be glad you are reading this post, because it will not happen, and most likely with that mindset, i.e. searching for that huge winner and yolo-ing all your money in it, or at least your speculative part of your account...you do have your account split in speculative and long term, like 90% in SP500 and 10% for speculation, right? Right? Of course you don't, so just read on.

There are a ton of scams in this space, starting with management issuing fake, misleading, or incomplete information to move the price, and ending with the latest bagholder who bought stock at the highest point and is trying to convince people to bid up the price so they can unload their bags and cover some of their losses.

Here is what you need to avoid when trading stocks and my quick advice on what to do instead:

1. **Never chase a stock that is making large moves in the session for no apparent reason** \- it is already moving a lot, whether the move is organic or fake, it has already happened so just don't chase stocks if they ahve made large daily or pre/post market session move. Instead, check the daily chart and see what has happened to the stock in the past, and make sure you are not buying it just when it is about to crash. Even if there is a ""reason"" it might be a fake press release by management to manipulate the stock higher so they can issue more stock.
2. **Never buy a stock that is heavily pushed on reddit, twitter, stocktwits and other social media** \- it is  heavily mentioned, then again check the chart - if it has made a large recent move, then whoever is talking about it is recruiting people to offload their shares, and move on to the next. You do not want to be their exit liquidity. Do a quick search and make sure that there no ""DD"" or other posts on it that claim huge returns and pressure you into buying it.
3. **Never trust ANY person who is asking/requiring you to buy ANY stock** \- a lot of nasty groups on Telegram or Whatsapp will pressure people into buying at a certain limit price and will ask for proof of purchase, in order to ""make sure they pay you back if any losses occur"" and this is just them knowing how much stock they can unload on you. Usually these manipulators work in waves, so one group make money off the next group, and so on, but ultimately, they exit at the higher prices and the stock crashes. This should be easy to handle by simply ignoring/blocking these people/accounts but people obviously never learn.
4. **Related to the above, never trust ANYONE who is telling you an exit price** \- ANY exit price is psychologically price anchoring, and you will be stuck at that level whether you know it or not, while they exit at a profit at a much lower price while you end up holding heavy losses. An exception to this are delisting plays, where a stock needs to be above $1 or above 10 cents, depending on what listing rules they violate. Anything else is a scam and you need to run if someone tells you that a stock trading under $1 will be trading at $10 in the next two weeks. This happens all the time so just ignore/block these accounts and move on.
5. **Never trust ""DD"" writers who do not disclose their positions in the stock and their intent to trade in either direction**. Most often, you will find DD with a bunch of ""research"" copied and pasted off the company financials and with little or no analysis, which is there to overwhelm you with information and cause to scroll all the way down for the TLDR, which is most likely going to be something like ""going to the moon, put your helmets on"" type sales pitch but they will not tell you that they own the stock and will dump it on a tiny uptick.
6. **Never trust unsolicited emails, spam SMS or other messages with any stock recommendations** \- if you are getting these without asking for them, then you are the last round of money flow in the stock, and you will be dumped on, guaranteed. Block these people, emails and numbers, because they are not doing this for your best interest, even if they do call you ""dear or ""darling"" in the message. This is particularly true if as part of the messaging you are being romanced and flirted with - remember they are not into you, but after your money. Same as above, ignore, block, and move on.

Hope this helps everyone to stay alert and not look for that huge one time score. Trading is a numbers game, so you need to trade small, often, be diversified and always take quick profits or loses, i.e. don't get greedy with your profits or unwilling to take small losses and move on.

I scan daily for stocks with subtle movement patterns showing accumulation and I also trade delisting stocks where I expect management or some other stock promotion group to start issuing ""news"" about the company in hopes of moving the stock up so they can issue or sell more stock at higher levels. I am not blindly buying these stocks thinking and hoping they will make me rich as a long term investor, but I trade them short term knowing that they are good candidates for management to manipulate their prices higher for their own benefit. There is a major difference between buying and hoping, and anticipating and then buying. 

Coming soon for my kofi supporters - in addition to my own opening trades, there will be an automatic discord alert channel for delisting and accumulation plays as they happen, whether I have a position in them or not. I expect anywhere from 1 to 10 delisting algo alerts a day, and about the same number of accumulation algo alerts for beaten down stocks which are showing renewed energy and are moving up.

The flavor seems to hit its peak from mid-month to the end of the month. 

By that point, I notice no bubbles coming from the beans during blooming (meaning the gas has fully dissipated).  

I’m curious—how long do you rest your beans before brewing? Is there a specific resting period for different beans based on their unique characteristics?

Hey, for as long as i can remember i've never really had consistent sleep by any means. When i was on antidepressants I had agomelatine for 2-3 years and mirtazipine for 2 months for assistance with sleep (along with depression ofc) before switching to vortioxetine (which AFAIK, doesn't help with sleep) so i was briefly on zopiclone (3-4 months), i stopped antidepressants full stop around a year ago now, no concerns with that.

But since i haven't had any sleep meds , I'm back to really poor sleep every single night. Before being discharged from my mh team (get a max of 3 years under NHS) i did mention this, we practiced routines and sleep hygiene in general, i still dont sleep more than 2 hours at a time , so i never enter REM. 

I've brought this up with my GP but it just gets put on the back burner as they don't really know what to do?? Day to day im not stupidly exhausted, ill have a coffee around midday, a if im doing a long day at work and going to the gym after an energy drink around 4pm (i wont be home until 1am ish) and im sound but by the time i get in to bed im exhausted but cant physically sleep. From what i know i dont believe its insomnia, i have also completely cut caffeine out the equation to see if it would help (1 month) and nope.

Any ideas , simply so i know what i can look in to and bring up with the GP as i know its not healthy and i would like to be able to get an actual nights sleep.",1,1740914539.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1j1opmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/1j1opmy/how_i_finally_made_manifestation_work_after/,How I Finally Made Manifestation Work After Nearly Giving Up (Part 2),"
Thanks for all the responses on my previous post! A lot of you asked how exactly I managed to shift my mindset, so I figured I'd follow up with more details about what worked for me:

1. Daily Small Wins: Manifestation can sometimes feel overwhelming when focusing only on huge goals. I started intentionally celebrating smaller manifestations daily—a good cup of coffee, a compliment, finding a good parking spot. This trained my brain to notice abundance everywhere, making larger goals feel more attainable.


2. Alignment Journaling: Every morning, I wrote about how my ideal self would approach the day. Not just ""what"" I wanted, but ""who"" I needed to become. Doing this regularly helped me naturally align my daily decisions and actions with my desired identity.


3. Gratitude with Purpose: Instead of general gratitude, I focused specifically on appreciating aspects of my life that mirrored my goals. For instance, if I wanted financial freedom, I'd genuinely feel gratitude for the stability or comfort I already had. This created a feeling of having rather than lacking.


4. Mindful Letting Go: This was the toughest part. Whenever anxiety or impatience creeped up about my manifestations, I practiced mindfulness techniques—breathwork, short meditations, or just grounding myself in the present moment. This calmed my nervous system and reduced resistance significantly.


Doing these things consistently, my mindset shifted from scarcity to abundance, and honestly, manifestation became less about ""trying"" and more about ""allowing."" Now, my manifestations come more naturally and effortlessly.

I am tested regularly, use condoms always (at least until safely negotiated otherwise), keep clean and am up to date on all vaccinations\*\*.

I’m polysexual, open to pretty much anyone except super masculine/alpha male types.

# A little about me:

* I'm 5'9"" with a Dad Bod.
* I'm a friendly Taurus (Sag rising for the astrology fans—yes, I’m chaotic but grounded), somewhat sarcastic and love banter. I like to tease and be teased. 😉
* I like road trips, Hiking (but not in winter, I like my fingers un-frostbitten), and beaches (clothing optional or otherwise, but options are always nice right?).
* I'm a well rounded music lover - except screamo because I’m not convinced it's music. Fight me. (Actually, do fight me, I’m very much into that 😈).
* I'm quite handy - I helped rebuild my parents’ house, so if you need a shelf installed after I wreck you in bed, I got you - I can also fix the bed.... 👀
* I'm a bit of a nerd - fantasy books, video games, Marvel, anime, and sci-fi, but I can also appreciate an indie or Oscar-bait film.
* Other weird hobbies - I recently got into puppeteering and can get into most things, a lot of my life has been shaped by the interests of others, I love getting to experience new hobbies.

# Now for the fun stuff:

I’ve been kinky for 20 years now. I know how to safely navigate and negotiate a scene. I generally prefer checklists, but I understand that they can be tedious. It's also something that I'm open to doing later once we know we have ***some*** chemistry. I've been both Dom and Sub and am open to both again.

What I’m into:

* 🔥 **Sensory play -** wax, ice, fire, overstimulation, tickling, massage if it creates a sensory effect I am into it. I've got a violet wand for electric play as well. I like to play with sounds/music as well and have incorporated taste/smell into play in the past as well.
* 🛠️ **Toys -** Dildos, vibes, floggers, crops, Wartenberg wheels (because the Germans always need to be included somehow, right?)
* 🔗 **Bondage -** I am good with restraints and cuffs, I know a few rope things and have read a lot about it, but doing it would be mostly new to me. Happy to learn/explore with someone though. The point is, let me tie you down and do whatever I want to your body and I promise you won't regret it! 😁
* 💨 **Breath play -** Choking, belts, collars, leashes, some plastic bag play, and a personal favorite: the pillow-over-the-face move. I have experience in both windpipe and blood flow restrictions.
* 😈 **CNC -** (psychologically and physically) I am overly cautious on this one sometimes, and I'd like to find someone that makes me feel safe to let loose on this front. I've had partners this has been really easy and engaging, but also others where my partner is bad at communicating and that makes me very focused on the consent part.
* 💪 **Struggle play -** in relation to the above, I love wrestling and resistance, making me work for it!
* 🔪 **Knife play -** as more of a ""threat"" thing than an actual stabby-stabby moment. Not too fond of Blood.
* 🚿 **Watersports -** I'm open to it, if done right.
* 🍆 **Free use -**  is great, reading a book? Let me just scooch in right behind you and use you for pleasure while you read. Or come and sit on me while I game. Even better when it's multiplayer. Also love the idea of being woken up or waking someone up to sex.
* 🎭 **Roleplay -**  wise I am down for absolutely anything - I used to and still do from time to time write erotic fiction or participate in erotic roleplay (Bonus points if you know what F-Chat is haha).
* 👀 **Sex clubs & public play -**  are great. I'm more of a Voyeur than Exhibitionist, but am okay with being seen. The red room in Oasis is always fun on a crowded night.
* 💙 **Aftercare -**  no matter what kind of scene we just did, I believe in taking care of each other.
* Oh and **👉👌 Sex -** I'm not into Kink for the sake of just Kink, it's absolutely sexual to me. Orgasms aren't the goal always, but I'd definitely prefer they happen for both of us frequently.

# What I don't do:

* 💩**Scat**
* 🩸 **Blood/cutting** (This is a soft limit, I could be convinced to do this)
* 🙄**Starfish partners** if you ALWAYS just lie there like a mannequin, it’s a no from me - that can be PART of play or a scenario where that's the point, and then that's great, but not as a basis.
* 🔌**Receiving anal** (sorry, no pegging **but I’m happy to give**).

As for the logistics:

* I can't really host\*\*\* but I’m flexible with timing - weeknights and weekends work best.
* 5.5"" grower, and I’m cool with it, my hands, mouth, and tools are where the real magic happens anyway. 😉 (4.5"" circumference, 1.4"" diameter)
* If you do need something bigger, I actually love using sleeves or even a strap-on.

If you made it this far, congrats—you’ve unlocked the *Send Me A Message* achievement! Tell me what you'd like to do and how you'd like to proceed.

I prefer to meet for coffee or tea or whatever first to do a vibe check for both of our safety. I am also open to video chatting before we meet in person at all if that makes you feel safer. I'm honestly cool to just meet and get right to it as well, but I'd want to chat for a bit at the very least - it all depends on vibes. 

    ** (If you’re still Covid-conscious, I don’t mask much anymore, but I work from home and am open to adjusting if it makes you more comfortable. My partner still masks in public, so I respect the practice.)
    *** I *MIGHT* be able to host with some caveats on timing, and no bed being involved, but it's something to be discussed.

1j1ond5,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1j1ond5/breast_lump/,Breast lump,"Hey everyone!

I found a lump in my left breast..with some research I've discovered it's in the upper outer quadrant. This is new (within the last week). I examed it super well because I have terrible health anxiety and spent 6 hours on Reddit reading breast cancer stories, symptoms, diagnoses. I cried for 5/6 hours of that time. I laid in bed until from 6-1am crying. I have a two year old and six year old and am so scared. I know someone who just died from BC and left behind kids a similar age. Scared is an understatement. Please please just reassure me.

I understand 80% or higher of all lumps tend to be benign. The lump isn't small, not pea sized, almost feels like a small golf ball or boiled egg size. If I try to pick it up I can literally lift it up and move it around. It feels like it's just in the breast tissue and not fixed to anything. It's become a little more prominent to feel now if I just rub my boob where as before I messed with it I really had to squeeze my boob to feel it. It's not painful but also not painless. A little discomfort. 

I'm about 10 or so days post ovulation and period is due in 9 days for context. I'm very petite, usually hang around 110-115lbs so my boobs are small (even smaller/deflated after 9 months of breastfeeding my first and two years of breastfeeding my second. No prior health issues. Dr. Does a manual breast exam once a year. I do drink 1-2 cops of coffee each morning, this is somewhat new... I only started drinking coffee maybe last Autumn so if this is common with caffeine use I have no problem stopping.. I'll probably actually start today

No other symptoms. No burning, no skin changes, no nipple changes, no discharge...maybe a little tingling in both but this happened during an anxiety episode and I tend to get tingly everywhere when I'm super anxious..I have a dr appt booked 5 days from now (for my annual well woman exam) but just emailed him and asked if he can squeeze me in tomorrow because I'm not sure my health anxiety can handle waiting a week...so we will see...if not I may drive myself to the ER for peace of mind because I can hardly function right now. I'm so inside of my head, reading about symptoms, looking at diagnostic scans. I've never had a lump in my breast before. My maternal grandmother had BC... I don't know the details but I know she had a mastectomy and is ok now, in her late 70s probably, close to 80.

Anyways
.. I'm freaking out. I'm 29 years old (JUST turned). Any insight is appreciated. The anxiety is crippling ",2,1740914110.0,WomensHealth,0,1.0,False

It can be a lonely place to be - so, if you’re struggling, I truly hope you get some value out of what I’ve learned - and I really, deeply wish you all the best.

First of all, I wanted to make a point that will absolutely not make you feel better. Yet, I really do believe it to be true.

**IT’S A GOOD THING IF YOUR EX MOVED ON QUICKLY**

Believe me, I know it doesn’t feel that way. But it is. I wish I didn't, but I know what you're going through - the panic attacks, the sickness in your stomach, the intrusive thoughts of them with someone else, the awful self-esteem, the questions, the confusion. How could they do this to me? Did I ever really know them? I know how overwhelmed you feel, in every moment of every day - it's all you can think about. You’re absolutely consumed by them - and you know the worst part? All you can picture of them is how happy they are with their new partner - and so the cycle continues.

I absolutely know how soul obliteratingly awful this is - I’ve just spent a month in the middle of it. But, you know what? It’s a good thing. Yep, it is. Because no matter how hopeless you feel, how bereaved, how lost, how wounded, how betrayed - you, my friend, are GRIEVING.

Yes! You are processing, whether you like it or not. All these emotions, all this turmoil - this is what you absolutely should be feeling. This is your body fighting back against the total angst that your previous partner has put you through. This is your brain screaming into the void as it tries to make sense of the new depths of hell you’re discovering. It's such an onslaught of emotion that is totally unavoidable, and there’s nothing you can do to stop it - and so you shouldn’t. This is your anatomy doing something extremely important on your behalf. HEALING.

Accept that these are going to be some of your darkest days, but that you’re going to learn an awful lot. Don’t be scared of the pain coming your way. No feeling is final. You’ll be okay.

This is by no means definitive, but they’ve all helped me successfully navigate being (probably) lied to and suddenly dumped from a 9 year relationship. Fun!

First of all, is something I shouldn’t have to say but it appears I may need to. **DO NOT TALK TO THEM**. I’m so serious. You can’t have any meaningful contact whatsoever - it's just a form of torturing yourself in order to feel close to them for a split second. But, it never goes the way you need it to. Cut them off, else these next points won’t make a single difference.

Also, no. You can’t be friends. You’re not there to make them feel better, or give them a plan B.

**EAT**

If you’re anything like me, in times of crisis, the first thing to go is your appetite. Very frustrating, as cooking and shared meals is usually such a source of joy for all of us. But you’ll have to muscle through this, I’m afraid. Try to stick to regular mealtimes, and also take advantage of when you do feel hungry. I would tell you to sleep, as well. But good luck with that one.

W’s Pro Tip - Have yoghurt and berries for breakfast. It's good for you, and starts the day right.

**GO OUTSIDE, EXERCISE, SAY WORDS TO SOMEONE**

I think in this modern age, it's very easy to forget that we’re incredibly simple organisms. We all have the same basic needs, and same biological responses to our environment. Sunshine, fresh air - is good for you. Exercise, no matter how easy - is good for you. Being social, talking about how you’re feeling or just belly laughing to nonsense, is really good for you.

It’s a bit of a hack - that we can spend 20 minutes doing something, and our brain flushes us with happy hormones for the rest of the day. So, use it. I guarantee you’ll feel better for it. Also, clean your room.

W’s Pro Tip - Give yourself some fresh air as soon as you get up, have your coffee hanging outside your window, whatever you can manage. It's life-affirming.

**FEELING IS DEALING**

As a wiser man than me once said - ‘There will be times where all the things she said, will fill your head, you won’t forget her’. Paul was right, there will be times where the break up consumes you completely. There will be times when all you can think about is how right this person was for you (spoilers, they weren’t). There will be times when you feel scared about the future. There will be times when you feel alone. This is all ok, and believe me, it's better to be feeling these emotions than not. Just allow yourself to feel, don’t judge yourself for it, and no matter how awful it is - know that it’ll pass.

W’s Pro Tip - Cry. Cry a lot. If you need a trigger to start, find one. I sobbed my way through Return of the King and felt like a new man afterwards.

**EXTERNALISE, BABY**

So much of what we’re feeling and experiencing is only occurring in our own head. It can begin to feel like a pressure cooker in there - but, lucky for you, there’s a handy way to release it all. Get your thoughts out into the real world! You can do this however you want - be it journaling, talking to friends, writing a song - anything. Just put your thoughts out into the world, and I absolutely guarantee they’ll feel less scary.

It's not a permanent fix. You’ll say everything you want to and feel so much lighter, but unfortunately then you’ll start to find the pressure building once again. Know what to do? Just repeat the process! Believe me, you’ll find things to talk about.

W’s Pro Tip - Voice notes. They changed my life and I honestly think have sped the process up by a couple weeks. Journaling is great, but it's slow progress and I always felt I had more to say but couldn’t figure out how to write it. So find a friend, ask them if it's ok if you bombard them every day with voice notes, say you don’t need their thoughts and advice in return (though you would value them, if they had the time to respond), and absolutely unleash on them. Give yourself some points that you want to make, or touch on, and just hit record and start talking.

It. Will. All. Pour. Out. I promise you. Within a week or two, you’ll struggle for things to say. It’ll all be said. Then, give yourself a short break, and restart the process.

Don’t have a friend suitable, or wouldn’t want anyone to hear what’s going on inside? Just record them for yourself. But do keep them, they’ll be good to listen back to when you feel ready.

**DISTRACTIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT YOUR FRIEND (unless they are friends)**

This is a bit nuanced, and you really need to be honest with yourself about it. Distractions aren’t good for you, little moments of escape are. Keep your links with the things you like to do as healthy as you possibly can. Don’t drink/smoke on your own at home. Don’t sink joyless hours into video games. Don’t exercise to the extent where you’re not allowing to rest. Don’t binge watch series you’ve already seen, just to make yourself feel better. Don’t let the break up ruin your relationship to the things in your life that actually provide joy.

Try new bars with friends. Speak to your family. Play games that are fun and satisfying. Listen to new music, or listen to the same music with a new appreciation. Explore more interesting films. Find a new hobby. Learn to dance. Take a class. Buy a guitar. Whatever!

These are all great for you - exploring yourself and what you like, not just giving yourself brief reprieve from the pain inside you.

**STOP LOOKING AT THEIR INSTAGRAM, YOU IDIOT**

It's natural to seek closeness, or to seek answers - but this won’t help either way. You’ll feel worse, I guarantee it. Put as much distance between yourselves as you possibly can, and if you find yourself doing this even when you know how awful it is for you - delete the apps that enable you to do so. You’re absolutely not missing a thing. Delete your old chats, delete the pictures, don’t listen to their music. Allow yourself to exist and grow beyond them.

W’s Pro Tip - Don’t have things in your space that remind you of them. Get rid of it all. If there’s anything too painful to give away, lock it out of sight and out of reach. One day, you’ll have no problem parting with it.

**DON’T YOU DARE LOOK FOR A REBOUND**

It won’t help. You’re not ready. I don’t care if they’ve decided to start seeing someone else after a month - that’s their mistake to make (and it IS a mistake). What you’ve received is a gift, believe me - though I know it doesn’t feel like one at the moment. You have the opportunity to work through grief on your own; to learn exactly how strong you can be, how resilient; to grow in a direction that you, as an individual, wants to grow, untied to the whims of someone else; to learn what really makes you happy, what fulfills you, what excites you; to reflect on what you’ve been taught by the relationship, and how it ended, and therefore what you can bring to your next one; to heal and grow to more of a person than you ever were with them.

This is an opportunity to build yourself up for the rest of your life. Even if it feels like all you’re doing is getting out of bed - you’re carrying this unbelievable grief, getting up, and being open to the world. That is admirable, and brave - and you’re going to look back and amaze yourself at just how strong you became.

W’s Pro Tip - Your self-esteem will be severely damaged, and someone else’s attention won’t fix that. So, put things in place that will heal and maximise it. Do something new, get better at a hobby, get a haircut, work on your body, dress better - whatever works.

**GET SETTLED, YOU’LL BE HERE A WHILE**

One really important thing to keep in mind is that you’re not on a timeline. There is no magic point where you’ll automatically get better. If there was, it’d just be a case of waiting until then. But the end point, the finish line, only appears when we’ve done the work to process what we’ve been through - and that may take a long time. That’s ok. Maybe there was just a lot to process.

Don’t worry about how long it's taking. Don’t worry if you’re on schedule. If you’re allowing yourself to grieve, if you’re reconnecting with yourself, if you’re reflecting on what you’ve been through - believe me, you’re on track.

I could ramble on for hours, but I think these are great things to keep in mind. I know how awful you feel. I know how bleak life is. But, you’re not alone. We’re all rooting for you.

One day soon you’ll feel the sun on your back and take a deep breath, and all will be well.

Lots of love, W

1j1of02,https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1j1of02/genuinely_how_do_i_stop_burning_bridges_while/,"Genuinely, how do I stop burning bridges while quitting?","I've left 3 jobs now, and I'm not confident in a reference from a single director I worked under. I always end up asking a coworker in an equal role or a person that didn't manage me directly.

My first job out of uni I was put under far too much pressure when a senior member of the staff left, I had to complete tight deadlines in a software that I didn't know (not the one I was hired for). I lost faith in my boss who kept saying yes to the deadlines that had me sleeping under my desk, I gave referrals to help more people get hired but he kept going to me. He took me to every meeting and did genuinely seem invested in training me up like an apprentice, but he also rejected my sick leave when I went to the hospital for emergency surgery because 'we cant miss deadlines (that he set)'.

I handed in the months required notice and he got really mad. On one hand I understand because I was leaving him even more short staffed, but I'd been under the pump for a year. He walked out of office and took an immediate months leave until I was gone. He kept complaining to everyone else after I was gone that 'he had so much riding on me', 'she was my favourite and left me high and dry' etc.

So I was good at my job (kinda) but can't use him as a reference.

Next job did not go well. My direct manager had no issues with me, sung me praises, but the project I was put on had a lot of hiccups (out of our companies control), and went over budget. I got let go during probation because of the higher ups not liking the profit margins, but my direct boss did try to stick up for me...

Most recent job, the senior above me got fired for incompetence (fair), and I was told to pick up their workload until they found a replacement. 2 years later I was still doing all the responsibilities of the role above mine, on a salary that was 20k lower than what I should be based on even just my own role (lowballed myself after the firing). Brought it up with management that I felt like they'd been stringing me along for this promotion for too long, and they gave me another 'maybe next year' (small business). So I handed in my notice. 

Boss got really mad (again) because I was managing a bunch of projects and they were already struggling to hire someone into that role above me. That notice period was awful because he kept going on about how I was going to fail at all my future endevours because I was a lazy entitled millenial. I stayed til 10pm most nights for months and still he went on about how I always 'left on the dot'. tbh it was more funny than anything else, like he hated the strawman more than me.

Like I get this trend happens because I leave when I am overworked or disrespected, which makes it hard because then they get even more understaffed. But I really don't know how to avoid that. Like yeah I can work 18 hour days for below industry pay and get yelled at constantly and never leave. But. No. 

Do I wait until they cool down and catch up for coffee or something and ask about how they are going?

I'm really not trying to burn bridges, I'm keeping my cool, I'm working notice, overtime even during handovers. I can't tell if I'm a doormat for constantly pulling allnighters and working above my pay grade, or a lazy piece of shit that quits the minute things get difficult. Both?

To all your new drivers out there just a little bit of advice and pieces of knowledge to save you time and money:

1) you do not get paid for the time it takes for you to travel to the restaurant. Learned this the hard way, which includes number two:

2) if you get to a restaurant, and for some reason, they are unable to make the order do not expect compensation of any kind. You will not be compensated for your drive to the restaurant nor your time that it takes to have this order canceled so that you can move onto another delivery. This brings me to my third point:

3) do not cancel the order on your end. It will absolutely count against you. If you are able to get a hold of the customer, ideally them canceling would be best, but if not, then you will most likely have to call customer support and make sure they cancel it. This might still increase your cancellation rate, but you stand a better chance of it not and you will not get paid for the time that you spent on the phone with them trying to cancel the order

4) if you don’t want to stack up orders, and you don’t wanna have to decline them, which will would it decrease your acceptance rate then after you have selected the order select a little coffee cup. This pauses the orders and no new ones will come in. 

5) lastly for now don’t expect anything from Uber support. I have come to the conclusion that even when you think you’re chatting with a live person, you are not. You will see that they do not address what you’re actually saying and answer what they think you’re saying.

Please keep in mind that each decision and action here also has a big intricate sub-story, but I dont want to be too long. Also I was not sure how to structure this, but here it goes.

Here goes:

\- We have been together for over 7 years now.

\- I was primarily raised by my mom, though we moved in to my step-dads when I was still in kindergarten. My relationship with stepdad is not the best, though, its much better now as I'm older than it was in the past. Though I want to add, that both of them are working a lot, so as far as the raising goes, I would say I was partially left on my own, raising-wise, since elementary school.

\- I have a bachelor in computer science, my GF has a bachelors in design.

\- Im currently working full-time while also studying masters Data science. She currently does not study, nor work full time, though she does a lot of part time jobs, primarily as a barista/waitress.

\- I am currently living at her place with her whole family (for about 4 years now), and everyone is fine with it. She has a rather large family, and I wouldnt say they live in a huge house, but at least we have our own room. The whole family is rather well connected though. Until recently, I was just sleeping here, but would continue to go to my families house (which is 10min away) to take showers and clean clothes. I would also have to store most of my stuff at home, since I didnt have much space at GF's house. This decision to stay at her place was largely due to her feeling great attachment to her family. I suggested numerous times, that maybe we could try to go live at my families place for a while, but to no avail. Now I also started ""living"" here for real, taking showers, cleaning my own clothes etc. I do not have to pay for anything, besides my own food. That being said, I try to live as low cost as possible.

\- I am a really clean person, and I dont like to make myself a burden for others. What I mean is, I have been raised in a way to always clean after myself, to clean after my lunch right after I eat it, not later. I am also really self sufficient. This means that all of the stuff I need done, I do myself (within reason, of course, I need help sometimes, but I will be the one figuring out what help and where to get it, and execute).

\- I would also consider myself prioritizing others before myself. I think long and hard about interactions I have with people, I'm aware when I dont act the best, and am actively trying to improve myself, though its hard. I try to help everyone with anything, especially my GF.

\- Im more of an introvert. I dont like to party, I can drink (but dont, since alcohol does not give me any notable benefits, I do not get ""lose"", I just compensate for drunk-ness, and try to behave rationally/same as before), same thing with weed. GF likes to party, but not drinking per-se, but just letting lose/dancing. This means that usually, I am not going to the parities with her (and we are both fine with that). I like to talk deeply with people, I like to explore the meaning in things, I like to discuss difficult questions with people. GF was less like that, more of a surface level communication, but is getting more and more into it, though I wouldnt say she likes it, she finds it difficult to think about stuff she does not understand. 

\- Since my GF has 3 siblings, we at some point decided, that we would also like to have as many children.

\- I am really self aware of the current situation I/we live in. The financial market is not the greatest, and prospects of me/us owning a home are not great. Unless one of us gets a really great job, buying a house on our own is probably possible only if both are stuck in debt for 30y, which sucks. I do have immense luck though, since my mom has some land we could build on, which reduces the cost significantly. So I am really positive about owning a home one day, but I know I will still have to work hard for it and earn it.

\- GF's family is not that lucky,  ""X / 4"" hits hard, if X not large enough haha.

\- Realistically, I feel like a house building procedure should be start-able in 3-4 years. I am saving around 80% of what I earn (I dont do lunches at work, I home prep, also try to save as much as possible on transportation, not buying unnecessary things). Also I am incredibly lucky that I do not have any additional costs, like rent. This feels like an okay time to start a family as well. While ideally, I would of course want to be able to provide everything myself, the reality is, that I would still need to get into debt. And I realize the more I manage to safe now, the less I will pay in the long.

\- I am constantly thinking about ways I could improve my (or I should say, our) odds. I am currently working on trying to start teaching kids during the summer about CS etc... I am also (really ambitiously) looking to develop some Saas (already have an idea and was working on a prototype, but then saw that a large local company also started working on it, which destroyed motivation), though with full time job and studying I already have a lot on my plate.

\- While I feel like doing ""everything I could"" (noone is doing everything they could), her life is not sorted out yet. I am trying to help her find a job in her field, asking if companies I interview for also need designers, also try to convince her to write to random companies, to at least start as an intern or something, to gain experience. But she just does not do it. When we talk about why, she claims that she does not yet feel comfortable with her skill. Then I analytically try to help her overcome that barrier, asking which sub-fields she would like to improve in, and try to help her find relevant sources to learn from. But she just doesnt do it. For her bachelors, she was doing something semi-interdisciplinary, some interactive website. Since she does not know programming but only design/3d modeling in blender, we decided (during her thesis) that I would help her bring the prototype to life after she finishes the diploma. This was 2 years ago, and we still didnt do it, even though I feel it has some potential. The reason being is, that she does not know how to bake some textures to the models (using some proprietary blender texture nodes, she needs to change it a bit) but just refuses to do it, so it didnt move in 2 years. 

In the meantime, since I deduced that maybe she just likes being a barista, I tried to encourage her to maybe do her own thing there (mostly because she is underpaid), since I feel like she really is an excellent barista, and also great with people). We tried to figure out what could work. But she just felt ""afraid"" to open her own bar. She also does not feel comfortable talking with her boss about the pay (though most people dread this probably). She also does not want to switch jobs, because she feels good with the current people she works with, except for the boss (which is totally valid imo). 

I should also add that she is an incredible baker, she creates cake masterpieces, and really knows her stuff desert-wise. So I also suggested she could start selling them. This was argued about for years. She felt like she does not know enough about it, she wants to join some classes (that are overpriced imo, but sure go ahead) but also does not act on it. And its not like I am the only one saying she is great at this. All the cakes she did do, the customers loved them (even if they were not her friends). Since the place she works at as a barista buys and sells cakes and other baked goods, I also encouraged her to try to maybe place at least one of her products there, but she does not want anything to do with the boss. So again nothing. 

4 months ago, she had a wonderful idea, to open a moving barista trailer. She felt really motivated and I though that finally she found something that makes her happy and feels confident in. And again, I tried to be as helpful as possible, tried to find where we could get the trailer she wants, found out that ordering from china is probably the cheapest, started talking with Chinese sellers about the prices/potential pitfalls, tried to inform myself with local government institutions if Chinese trailer is even road-safe/allowed, how to pay import tax, what DDP etc...  \*\*and i know this might look like I am a total control-freak, taking her joy or doing stuff she didnt ask me to do...but it is not like that (wellp she might disagree), but there are numerous other projects she started and didnt finish, even though I did not help/have opinions on...\*\*. So the last 2 months, I have been also dealing with this. While I was doing this, she was looking for which equipment she wanted to have, looking at some expensive coffee machines etc. I suggested to her that before she ""wishes"" for 10k of equipment, she should just start small, so she sees if it sticks before she spends money for this. Worth noting here, that she actually does not have enough money currently to cover this investment, but I am more than happy to help. That being said, maybe the following will say something about her character. When we were discussing how this would work financially, she refused to provide at least the money she had, she said, that I said I will buy it for her and she would return it once the business will pop-off (not in a scammy way, i know she would). One argument later, she changed her mind so that she would only give (lets say) 65%, because she needs the rest for her ""expenditures"".   
Anyway, since ordering from China is not the safest, I was also searching locally for people who ordered from China, so that we could  check the quality and if it fits her needs. I found a guy, who owned 2 of the exact ones we were trying to get. I tried to schedule a meeting with him and my GF, but GF somehow got out of it, so I went alone...He provided some good insight and agreed that he would show his trailers to us, to just give him a call and we can arrange something. Me and my GF decided on some tuesday afternoon, to go check it out, but she again got something in-between (she switched work with coworker, not necessary, she was just being 'nice'), so we didnt go check it yet for about a month. Since this didnt work out yet, I was also looking for other options, found some guy that creates custom trailers, and called him, asked about the price etc, and he said that its best if we tell him exactly what we want, so he can estimate it best. I told to my GF, that she can make a blender model resembling the custom trailer she wants, and we could also go check the local guy's trailers, to see how much space there is and what would fit her. This was 2 weeks ago, still no progress.

Basically, yesterday, again, we got into a fight. It was a dumb fight, dont want to write another paragraph about it, but basically, i asked her if she would go for a walk at 1600, she would say, sure, but lets go at 1700. When the clock turned 1655, she messaged me, if we could go half an hour later....So we almost went at 1740, when her cat was behind the outside doors, so she let her in, and then went ask around the house if anyone has fed her already, which they did. So in the end, we left the house at 1750. This is not an alone event, so I was a bit pissed. We started arguing again (nothing out of the ordinary, not a big fight), but then I had to leave. When I came back, she suggested, I should move out for a bit, so we can think about it in private. She claimed that she feels constant pressure about me wanting a house, and that she feels pressure she needs to save all the money she saves. She also claimed that she is a much happier person than me, and that maybe I should seek help. So basically, I am not exactly seeking help here, but just asking for opinions.  
  
Also, this is only an incomplete part of \*\*my\*\* story. I tried to write this as objectively and truthfully as possible. I am not here to hear a bunch of people telling me right, if anything, I wish they would tell me I am wrong. I just want to maybe get some tips on how to approach this ""situation"".  There are also hundreds of other variables I would love to explain, but I am not trying to write a book. I understand relationships are hard, and I also did not give up on it. I am merely trying to get some feedback about whether I really am the issue here. Even if she is the issue, I would never throw that in her face, I just want to help.

So there I was, standing my daily watch over the gut truck, balancing my breakfast burrito in one hand and my fifth Monster of the day in the other, when I spotted a walking disgrace to the fine institution that I single handedly keep afloat through my leadership.

A Sergeant. In cammies. On FANCY FRIDAY.

Unacceptable.

Now, I know what you’re thinking:
“But Staff Sergeant, why do you care? He’s not in your unit.”
“But Staff Sergeant, he’s TAD, he doesn’t have to wear Bravos.”
“But Staff Sergeant, shouldn’t you be at your desk doing actual work?”

SHUT THE HELL UP, BOOT.

See, real leadership means inserting yourself into situations that don’t concern you because if I have to suffer, EVERYONE has to suffer.

So, with the speed of a 3rd extension Corporal running away from responsibility, I waddled at max capacity toward this undisciplined millennial disgrace, glistening in Monster sweat, ready to unleash a level of toxic leadership not seen since my last reenlistment package got denied.

I deploy the knife hand and bellow in my best Green Belt DI voice:

“HEY! YOU BETTER SQUARE YOURSELF AWAY, DEVIL DOG!”

Instead of immediately dropping into the front leaning rest position and thanking me for my superior leadership, this soft excuse for a Marine TURNS AROUND LIKE I’M NOT EVEN HIS STAFF NCO.

Then he hits me with:
“Uh, Staff Sergeant, I’m TAD, I’m not in your chain of command.”

EXCUSE ME?

NOT IN MY CHAIN OF COMMAND?!?

LISTEN HERE, YOU SHITBAG
I AM EVERY CHAIN OF COMMAND.
I AM THE MARINE CORPS.
I HAVEN’T READ A SINGLE MARADMIN SINCE 2011
I KNOW EVERYTHING.

So, like any true motivator, I immediately enter a 45 minute sermon about discipline, tradition, and how “the problem with this generation” is that they don’t want to be hazed anymore.

And then…

HE JUST WALKED AWAY.

I stood there, mouth open, burrito slipping through my sausage fingers, Monster dripping onto my coffee stained Bravos, watching this absolute disgrace DISRESPECT my leadership by simply… ignoring me.

No “Aye, Staff Sergeant.”
No “Thank you for your wisdom, Staff Sergeant.”
Not even a “Can I carry your gut truck trash for you, Staff Sergeant?”

Just pure, unfiltered, 21st-century disrespect.

As I stood there, clutching my exploding heart, my knees screaming for medical separation, I whispered the words that have become my morning mantra:

“This new generation is a disgrace to the Corps.”

And that, gentlemen, is why I’m here, venting to other real warriors who still understand what it means to lead from the front.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go deny some leave requests for no reason and spend the next four hours in the smoke pit talking about my Iraq deployment that ended before half of you were born.",3,1740912468.0,USMC,3,0.6,False

as the title says I want to convert my hand grinder to an electric one.  
Coffee beans (especially the kind that i like) require quite high torque.

At first I tried using a battery powered screwdriver but it was far from strong enough:  
[https://www.amazon.de/dp/B086SQK2RK](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B086SQK2RK)  
Then I tried a battery powered drill which struggled a bit but did the job:  
[https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0CFY1NPX7](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0CFY1NPX7)  
So as a proof of concept it works!

**So to make things easier, smaller and replicable by others I need your knowledge.**  
I have no knowledge of electronics but i like to tinker with stuff.  
I need a motor that has at least as much torque as the one on the drill in the second link (i'm not sure I trust the advertised numbers), and anywhere between 250-600rpm.

I don't know if i need a geared motor or a stepper motor or another type. I also want to do it as cheap as possible but with relative reliability the things that I see lead me to believe I can do it with under 60€ (or 75 with variable rpm)

The plan is to make a 3D printed housing for the motor that also holds the grinder in place. This is the part that i know how to do. After i finish this I would like to release the 3D files for free and provide a guide on how to assemble everything. It is important for me for the end result to be cheap, easy to build and the parts to be easily purchasable so I want everything to be available on [**amazon.de**](http://amazon.de)

1j1o7c0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1j1o7c0/february_was_the_worst/,February was the worst,"So, I left a long-term 14 yr loveless relationship  a year ago. We were going through the motions, wouldn't look at each other in the eyes after work. Financially, we were in good shape, took luxury 3 week vacations but I always had this nagging feeling he wasn't the one. I didn't want to get married, I didn't want a baby with him. It was hard to essentially go through a divorce, a lot of emotions to process.

There were a lot of reasons though and felt mutual. Eventually, I had fallen in love with a co-worker after 2 years of denying that I liked him. We got into a relationship and became so close very fast. It's the most loving relationship I've ever been in, he's amazing in so many ways. We're highly compatible too. One thing that has been difficult is my boyfriend has 3 kids from a prior long-term relationship. I had never dated anyone with kids before so that was like a shock to the system. But, it's been working and I've had to adjust to some things in regards to being a stepparent.

Like finances are tough. My boyfriend works two jobs to pay for child support and I don't see him a lot because of this. But, we worked together so we had facetime during the day, took breaks together. It was beautiful and fun actually. We both loved it! It made any financial problems feel not that bad because we at least could see each other. And, after dating him, I will say, my lifestyle changed a lot. I live way more modestly now which isn't a bad thing though. I grew up poor and struggled a bit in my 20s, so it wasn't that big of a deal to me. 

So, at the beginning of the year, I found out I was pregnant. We both wanted the baby so badly. We debated for a long time what it would look if we kept the baby and the logistics. We concluded that he would be working literally from morning to night all the time except his custody day with his kids. He'd never be home to see me or his baby and he wants to be a part of our lives, he wants to be a full-time father again. I know that would've made him so happy but the reality is that I would have been living like a single mother essentially. Not how I pictured either.

So, we unfortunately got an abortion and it was really hard on us. I still haven't fully processed it and have some negative emotions to work through in regards to doing that and him already having 3 kids. It hurts so much. I've told him in detail how it makes me feel and he's supportive and we're trying to improve our lives and finances to plan on a baby in the future.

Then, less than two weeks later, I was fired unfairly from my job. The store manager was the worst type of person. He would harass certain people and after I began dating my boyfriend, I became a target for whatever reason. 2 other people in my dept were fired for marking down product meant for shrink and a lot of times it was scanned out for shrink, we had permission from the dept manager the majority of the time. All 3 of us who were fired were immigrants with dual-citizenship, interestingly enough. They wanted to downsize the dept too, and of course the people marking down bad product to buy themselves were an easy target. No verbal or written warnings ever for something we had permission to do. And literally, nearly everyone in the dept was doing this in some way. It was a culture. It might have gotten out of hand and I know I shouldn't have been doing that but it was a gray area somewhat. 

I no longer have an income and don't get to work with my boyfriend anymore. I'm still grieving the baby and now I'm processing job loss and having time with my boyfriend. 

It all feels like way too much to deal with as someone who has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. 

It's too much loss within a couple weeks. Lose our baby, lose a job and feel like I'm losing my boyfriend. I know I haven't lost him but now that we don't work together, I really don't see him that much through the week. One half day together and then one afternoon/evening. Then at night, after 8pm. His day off, the kids are over, so while we're together it doesn't feel the same. I had worked there nearly 8 years. Another woman had been there over 15 years.

We used to have coffee and get ready together in the morning, drive into work together, take breaks together and just go through the day be each other's sides and now I just sit here alone for sometimes 14 hours straight. I might see him for 45 mins in between jobs. I know, working with your partner isn't the norm, but we did and both loved it and had gotten used to it. 

My anxiety has gotten so bad. I've been neurotically deep cleaning the house. I have a very small business but with no job, it's hard to fund for materials right now. I have debt related to starting my small business. Everything feels like it's at a standstill and I want to believe that we're making way for new and that there's something better down the road but with how I feel, I don't know if that's true. 

I've been trying to keep myself as busy as possible but feel so lost. I've been through some hard times but at 33, this feels like the worst. I've been recovered from a drug addiction for many years now and this feels so much harder than that. I'm hoping for the best but it's just waayyy too much to process at once

\- Telling myself ""I've thought this thought before"" whenever anxiety bubbles up, and immediately redirecting my thoughts to a different topic.

\- Telling myself when I'm about to overthink that ""I've never out-thought this thought before, so what would change now?"" 

\- Telling myself that reassurance seeking is literally pointless, we don't know the outcome of anything.

\- Bit of a sadder one but when I see  TikToks of ROCD sufferers and avoidant attachment really visibly upset about how they're trying to get through, I try tell myself that I am strong and will not let my negative thoughts get me back to that same space I also once was before.

\- Focusing on my partner! And focusing on how funny or endearing or complimentary we are of each other. 

\- I like myself better when I'm not overthinking! And better about focusing on the world. Genuienly the little things like buying myself a funky new coffee or spraying my fav perfume and redirecting myself to appreciation and compassion.

1j1o4z3,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1j1o4z3/a_meeting_with_my_younger_self/,A meeting with my younger self!,"A meeting with my younger self

It was a drowsy day, Monday was mundane to me. I decided to call in sick, skipped breakfast and went for a long walk in the nearby garden. 
I wanted to talk, talk a lot so decided to call him, yes I called my younger self today.

He first told a straightaway no. May be fearful, may be not having enough petrol to travel or spend on coffee or probably insecure about his belly and body shape. I suggested him to take permission and recommendation from his best friend to which he agreed. And you know what, he cheerfully called me within a few minutes and agreed to meet. 

I asked him to suggest the place to which he replied sugar and spice, I told it is no more now. His face dropped down and became really really sad. I can sense the turmoil in his brain. He might have cried a little because this place was very close to him and he used to take his favourite people there for having pastries, be it his crush on Janmashtami or his best friends for his birthday. He considered it as his second home. I knew how to bring him back to senses and suggested unwind cafe nearer to Ghod dod road because I am aware that he will get confused between citylight, ghod dod and Vesu. He has not travelled much, he has not suffered much. 

And in the evening at sharp 6 pm he came, hiding his belly, hiding his pimples and walking with a broad smile. I went to the place at 5:30 only because I knew he was punctual. He was present at the location at 5:45 pm only as usual and kept waiting downstairs. 

He wore his favourite blue shirt and grey pants, he thought it would help him hide his extra belly fat. Alas! he was wrong, he was really fat but he was honest. He was comparatively happy without any heartbreaks. I gave him the menu card, he loved being a centre of attraction those days. He ordered chocolate brownies with ice cream and gleamed with utter joy. Ordered two and asked me politely. I ordered two slices of pizza. Our favourite till date. Because We+Pizza = together forever. He was skeptical thinking about his body fat but I assured him.  Also, little did he know that those brownies were the main culprit for his weight gain. He was not aware about the concept of sugar cravings, about low carb high protein diet, about the intentions of the people dear to him, about his parents’ financial situation and their hardships, about the heartache he will have, about the heart stroke he will have, about the multiple dengue attacks he will have, about the toe surgeries he will have, about his best friends secret engagement or his younger brother’s marriage. He was there sitting unwavered, unharmed; awaiting his brownies, awaiting his life.

He tried to initiate the conversation and kept looking at my apple gadgets, for him this was his dream. He thought that apple products were made for cream people and not for us. He went through my clothes and shoes. He was amazed by the brands. Still he noticed my dull eyes behind my contact lenses, and scanned my white hair through the broad head. He asked me about our mother and I said she is all okay. I asked what she was making today. He uttered chicken curry, roti and meatballs. My favourite till date but I don’t eat them anymore. I have now turned vegetarian, I have turned barbarian with my own family.

He kept talking about the pressure of his exams, his father’s attitude and his mother’s sacrifices. He asked me about the future. I gave him some positives; the doable salary package, the job in hometown which he wanted, the posh house, loving parents, singlehood and a cute little nephew. He blushed and asked about our marriage, I commented no with an assuring smile and said it will be in our best interest. 

I talked about us being a Chemistry teacher, his weakest subject. Talked about being best friends with wonderful people at multiple job roles. Talked about office politics and heartbreakers, exciting solo trips and sleepless, teary nights. He was shrewd yet sensitive, wasn’t able to digest more and told me to stop. His eyes were wet, his body shaken, he pulled down his shirt and pulled up his pants, he wiped his face with the small hand rolled napkin and took his slingbag to storm out. He literally ran and never looked back. I was sure that he would call his best friend and our mother was there to hold him. I know he will sleep contented and realize it was a dream, he will also skip his meals for a day and again engage with his daily routine, expecting a miracle to happen, expecting to marry with his crush, expecting his best friend to be his side forever, expecting to earn much for his parents and family.

Personal Experience (Through Jackie’s Eyes)

Jackie, my neighbor’s mom, has always been the go-to person for natural health advice in our community.



When I mentioned I was researching Gluco Extend, she lit up and told me she had been using it for a few months. Curious to hear her thoughts, I asked her to share her experience.



Jackie explained that after struggling with fluctuating blood sugar levels and constant fatigue, she decided to give Gluco Extend a try.



Within a couple of weeks, she noticed a marked improvement in her energy and found herself reaching for fewer sugary snacks—a win-win for both her health and her pantry budget.



She also appreciated the simplicity of the supplement: just a couple of capsules with her morning coffee, and she was good to go.



However, she did mention one small hiccup. The first few days brought a bit of stomach upset, but this faded quickly as her body adjusted.



Overall, she was thrilled with the results and even recommended it to a few of her friends at her weekly yoga class. Hearing her story firsthand only reinforced my belief in the product’s effectiveness.

1j1nzc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nihilism/comments/1j1nzc0/perhaps_until_fall_sets_in/,Perhaps until fall sets in?,"I'm so back and forth with all of this, and it doesn't really matter what someone may have to say or what therapy supposedly can do, meditating or a form of spirituality or religion, so just setting a rough date seems to have worked. This morning at least.

There's enough money in my bank account to make it until later this year. Tired of working, say what you want about that and I'm not a lazy worker, just over it. Hard to put into words and I'm fine around other people, not even putting a mask on either I have a lot of fun with others. And they'd be surprised and perhaps appalled that I have a rough date set.

It's not depression, I know what that's like. Pretty soon I'm going to get up and make some coffee then probably go to the gym. It's supposed to be really nice outside today so I'll definitely get outside and enjoy that. But in the end none of this meant much of anything, and that's OK. 

There's just something that's pretty simple about none of this having a purpose, meaning. To where expounding upon that is just pissing in the wind. And I've come across plenty of posts on here about how this sub is not for depression, nihilism is not depression, well cool and I'm not. Just setting a date of sorts and...happy Sunday. I hope that none of whoever out there reads this gets to this point. 

Life is an odd thing. Goes without saying. There are a lot of wonderful and meaningful things out there and experiences that I've had, just tired though. Not physically because I'm about to go run on a treadmill for a while, just tired.",1,1740911404.0,nihilism,0,1.0,False

Kendu is 1 year old and is backed by a rock solid community. We are arguably the strongest community in crypto right now and we are gonna get a lot stronger once the market turns(we are a sleeping giant). Kendu has 17k holders and we are growing daily. Community is the reason Doge, Shiba, Pepe and other billion dollar meme coins reached the heights they did. Kendu also has produced a lot of IRL products and events which sets us out amongst the rest, as it bridges us between the real world and crypto, this will help us onboard a lot of new investors.

**WHY DOES COMMUNITY MAKE SUCH A DIFFERENCE**

Community provides a coin free, 24/7 advertisement, a culture and a home for its holders. It can capture the eyes of potential holders whilst saving project funds for listings. Community is addicting, humans need interaction and that's what a community provides. At Kendu, no matter your beliefs or background you are welcome, you will make friends here and learn a hell of a lot.

**IRL EVENTS**

Kendu has a glow in the dark pickleball event in India ran by Kendu Entertainment, which is attracting lots of very reputable people

Kendu is a head sponsor of Miami Music Week which is coming on the 29th March

**IRL PRODUCTS**

Kendu Gum, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Energy, Kendu Pendants, Kendu Merch, Kendu VideoGames  
and more

**WHY CHOOSE KENDU**

Kendu is at a very similar mc that Shib was at in Feb 2021, this means Kendu is in a position in which a 1000x is very possible. If we reached Shib's level, which is certainly possible since there is now far more money in crypto, this is over a 4000x. We have the same characteristics that Shib had. There is no reason we cannot do the same. Stop Gambling and Start Building. Join Kendu, its your  
chance to retire.

Kendu’s distribution is very good, only 52% of the supply is owned by the top 100 wallets, compared to over 70% in other major memecoins. This gives Kendu way more stability and it is a great sign we will go far.

Kendu is ranked very positively by Certik(a very reputable organisation who rates the safety of a crypto)

Why are Koreans not interested in DMZ? 


1. It takes about 1 to 2 hours from Seoul to DMZ. It's not even interesting. DMZ is a tourist destination mostly visited by foreigners or locals who fantasize about war tensions.


2. In fact, the DMZ is a region of strong military significance, and it is the border with North Korea. But Koreans don't want to recall the heaviness or political complexity of the subject. So, I may not feel the need to visit.


3. The DMZ does not come as a particularly attractive tourist destination because people in Seoul can access various tourist destinations in Seoul without having to go to Paju, where dmz is located, for an hour. This is because I can already do many interesting activities in Seoul.


4. South Koreans don't expect to meet North Koreans or feel something about North Korea in DMZ tours. They can't see and film freely during DMZ tours, and they have to go on a group tour. It's old-fashioned. 


So I'd rather go to Gimpo Aegibong Starbucks where I can meet Marines, or Paju Odusan Dopino Coffee Shop.
