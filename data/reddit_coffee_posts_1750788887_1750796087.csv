1ljlgd8,https://i.redd.it/6y9dicslgx8f1.jpeg,"(D&C Solutions) about ""cargo containers"" and the problems with them.","I'll just say it straight up. Using a very hardcore outdated mod (MKS or USI or any 'logistics' mod) that adds outdated parts that looks very bad in terms of modern KSP graphics, and is extremely difficult, just to make these functional is criminal in today's world of KSP. By no means is Station Parts a bad mod, nor is MKS or any resource mod. I respect the authors of MKS for doing what they do, but sometimes I feel like I'm playing a hardcore version of KSP when trying to build a tiny base. Any logistics and storage modules just don't have any good functionality without MKS, USI, or any ""resource consuming"" mod of your choice. They're purely aesthetics, and they look cool otherwise.

How about we fix this into a more modern version of KSP thats:  
1. Simple and effective  
2. Doesn't over-utilize resources  
3. Takes a page from KSP2?   
  
Well... instead of using them just for ""base building,"" we can use them for full blown colonies, also supporting tweakscale.   
  
Unfortunately I am not a ""mod-maker"" so if anyone is willing to pick up this ""mod idea"" please contact me.

The Mod Idea:

D&C (Drop and colonize)   
In the vab or sph, you can choose from (these) cargo parts or mods of your choice to build colony parts (such as domes, vab's, launchpads, comm towers) with one click. However in career and science mode, they take up resources (parts) and the less engineer Kerbals within a 100 meter diameter, the more time it takes to get done.   
  
These effects are negated with sandbox, but you will get a warning message if your resources (boxes) are insufficient to build a part. It doesn't negate anything though. You have unlimited parts in sandbox.   
  
This sounds really cool as all ""utilization"" mods besides EPL (extraplanetary launchpads), (other mods) doesn't really allow for base/colony building. Even then, EPL limit's itself by how big you can make your ships and base parts, Kerbal Konstructs feels a bit cheaty, and MKS is extremely outdated and just has very basic looking parts. It's also really resource dependent, and quite hard might I add.  
  
This mod (although I don't know how to make mods) will 100% simplify the colony process and I think it sounds extremely fun. Also, all base parts have interiors. you can build 100 meter domes, 50 meter domes, launchpads for ISV, etc... There would probably be over 50 base parts. You can also connect other base parts via walkable pressurized tubes (with interiors) Another cool feature is that Kerbals will automatically reproduce at a rate depending on colony size and the surplus of food (which comes included with just building domes or farming buildings (or cargo containers) Farming isn't even required. It just increases the efficiency of Kerbals in their tasks.  
  
You can also define base borders so that the 100 meter rule starts to work wherever you want it. The limit is 1000 meters though for one border side. Kerbals will also willingly walk around inside structures and will grab coffee and such. (This animation can be borrowed or modified from Kerbals inside the vab or sph walking around.) It will only be visible however if you choose an active Kerbal and go IVA inside the dome.

The mod will also include a side-step third person camera mode, and a first person camera mode, to completely solidify the interior walking experience of these base parts.

I really hope you enjoy this mod idea. I've looked everywhere for similar mods and not one came close to my idea. The idea is to take Kerbal Konstructs and make the structures (per game) and not (all saves) while adding a construction feature where Kerbals will be animated building the structures and colony buildings over time. (give or take depending on how many Kerbals you have within said diameter)

Something really cool might I add (again) will be the feature to connect other buildings in EVA, via a draggable and inflatable tube that can go for hundreds of meters.

This is basically my solution to the KSP2 colony problem for KSP 1.  
  
I'm also aware that someone else already made a ""KSP2 alike"" colony mod very recently. If anything, I would like to see those parts integrated with a mod like this.

I want colonization with buildings to be simple, not repetitive, and easy for the player. No need to stress about a lack of resources. Relax. Your Kerbals are already building farms inside the dome, because they're self-sufficient, they already developed a resource harvester, and they've already constructed a solar farm. (as long as you have enough Kerbals lol.)  
  
It just makes sense, and that's how it should be done. A self-sufficient base shouldn't require any player intervention. Kerbal see, Kerbal do.

Again, I'm not a mod maker, and this is not a ""mod release."" Thanks for understanding.",2,1750795503.0,KerbalSpaceProgram,0,1.0,False

Truthfully, I really wanted to work in ATC because I've always liked managing/organizing logistics and solving problems of that nature, but the biggest thing that I've found concerning about that job is that everyone made it sound *significantly* more likely that you're assigned somewhere for an almost once-in-a-lifetime chance at doing ATC and it could be somewhere busy like ATL or it could be in the middle of nowhere and kinda boring and you either take it and work or don't and never get to do ATC.

Alongside that, being a pilot, at least as far as I'm aware, has at least one but maybe two benefits in terms of ""travel"" over ATC. Almost assuredly, I imagine you have to stay away from home and have at least a few hours to try a food place wherever the destination is (even if you have to wake up early in the morning to take a flight back). The other *maybe* benefit but not one I'm expecting everywhere is that I've heard major airlines can have an employee benefit to last minute fill in seats that aren't purchased, which, at least on days off might be helpful for me to go back and see my extended family or go somewhere new. 

**But I want to double-check on the average experience of the need to permanently relocate for work, depending on where you live.** To be specific, I live in LA and since I've been here coming up on 4 years, I'm not too keen on moving and starting over somewhere completely new. I suppose I can - I'm 26 and single so I don't have heavy ties here, I suppose, but I'd prefer not to have to move to Wyoming where I imagine there's no signs of life for miles. I'm not pressed to be home every night or even most nights though - I've been away from home for practically 2 months for my current job and I really do like traveling and seeing new places a lot. I just like a few of the places I frequent here a lot - the coffee shop I'm currently at for example. 

So, have you had to relocate cities or even states or farther for a job as a pilot and is it a common thing that you've seen others have to do as well? ",2,1750795411.0,flying,2,1.0,False

He had originally said something like we could grab bubble tea, coffee, dessert, a beer, or whatever, so I figured he was open to different ideas. I suggested the new bar that just opened at the mall. Then he responded and suggested we meet at a coffee shop instead.

At 7pm. For coffee.

I do not know. I am not expecting a nice dinner, but with so many options right there, it just felt low effort. I might just be spoiled by past first dates where we sat down somewhere and had food, but this felt more like a last-minute filler plan than someone actually trying.

Am I being difficult for feeling like this prospect has no potential, or is that a fair reaction?

1ljlcch,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectmanagement/comments/1ljlcch/from_brain_dump_to_done_how_i_built_an_aipowered/,From Brain Dump to Done: How I Built an AI-Powered PM Workflow That Automatically Grooms Tasks,"Okay PMs, as an Sr Engineer who has to wear their scrum master or PM hat often it's confession time: I used to spend more time grooming backlogs than actually managing projects. You know the drill - brilliant idea hits during coffee, gets scribbled on a napkin, then dies in refinement hell for 3 weeks.

Not anymore.

**The Problem We All Know:**

* Ideas come fast, structured tasks come slow
* Backlog grooming meetings are soul-crushing
* Half the team checks out when you're discussing t-shirt sizes for the 47th time
* Tasks sit in ""Draft"" status forever because writing good acceptance criteria is hard

**My Solution - The Brain Dump Pipeline:**

**Step 1: Raw Idea → Claude Desktop** I literally just talk to Claude about whatever random project idea I have. ""Hey, I want to build a customer feedback widget that does X, Y, Z."" Claude asks smart questions, helps me think through edge cases, identifies technical requirements I missed.

**Step 2: Claude → Flotify via MCP** Here's where the magic happens. Claude doesn't just help me think - it directly creates tasks in Flotify through MCP integration. Each task comes out fully formed:

* ✅ Clear user stories with acceptance criteria
* ✅ T-shirt sizing (it actually gets our team's velocity)
* ✅ Business value scores
* ✅ Priority rankings
* ✅ Definition of done that matches our standards

**Step 3: Flotify → Execution** Tasks land in our backlog ready to go. Team picks them up, or I assign them to AI agents for the simpler stuff. No grooming meeting needed.

**The Results:**

* 30-second idea → Production-ready backlog
* Eliminated 90% of our refinement meetings
* Team velocity increased because less time debating, more time building
* AI agents handle \~20% of our technical tasks now

**Simple Setup:** Just Claude Desktop + Flotify MCP. Total setup time: maybe 20 minutes.

**Advanced Setup (for the ambitious):** Throw n8n into the mix. Now ideas can trigger from anywhere - Slack messages, calendar events, GitHub issues, customer support tickets. Full automation from idea capture to task assignment.

**The Learning Loop:** Best part? The AI learns from our completed tasks. It's getting scary good at predicting effort estimates and writing acceptance criteria that actually match how our team works.

I went from dreading backlog management to actually enjoying the creative planning process again. Anyone else building similar workflows? Would love to compare notes on what's working.

**Tech Stack:**

* Claude Desktop (any MCP-enabled client works)
* Flotify MCP + Task Manager
* n8n (optional, for advanced automation)

Living together for one. In the last month or so I’ve noticed his screen time has jumped quite a significant amount. And in the last two weeks he’s been off work (office renovation) it’s skyrocketed to nearly 9hrs a day. I have gently said “hey you’re really scrolling away over there” to which he replies “I’m allowed”. Then a few weeks later I mentioned how it’s not good for your brain to be doing it that often. Now, I’m a frequent Redditor and all but it only consumes maybe 25 mins of my daily screen time. His Reddit use is more like 6hours a day. Every time I look over at him he’s scrolling. He will put his phone down on the coffee table and picks it back up within 30 seconds. We were in a waiting area for a small procedure and he had already given me his phone to put away and he could not sit alone with me in a room for 8 minutes before asking me to get his phone. I said “that’s a little concerning” but he shrugged it off. I sat quietly knowing I could look at my phone later. 

In the past this was a huge problem with an ex. I would ask him a question and it would take several minutes before he bothered to look up at me and answer. Sometimes so long that I’d forgotten what I asked. I don’t think it’s fair to compare someone to an ex but I’m starting to worry that’s happening here too. Maybe I’m a terrible bore, and the problem is me. I try to engage him in conversation and he’s just flicking his screen into oblivion and half answering me or will say “I’m reading”. 

Something about it is unattractive. And there’s also an annoying aspect to this as well. When he’s finally finished for a few mins if I happen to be reading my kindle he expects me to put it down immediately because he has something to say. That makes me see red if I’m being honest. I politely say “I’m reading” and he will go back to his scroll but often I never know what he was going to say because he stays on his phone for another hour. 

I asked him to let the dog out and he said “okay one minute” then I realized that she had been waiting at the door for 40 minuets when I came back down from what I was doing upstairs. I’m getting annoyed with this scrolling. But I don’t want to treat him like a child and cap his screen time because he’s an adult and he should want to spend time in the world with his partner. 

How can I word this without coming off like his mommy or his teacher?

TL;DR - my partner is spending upwards of 9hrs a day on his phone and it’s worrying to me. How can I curb his screen time without sounding like his mommy? ",2,1750794816.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

* I initially connected with a **District Vice President** through LinkedIn, who kindly referred me to someone from the team for a coffee chat.
* After that, I had a coffee chat with a campus team member, and a few days later, I received an email from a **Senior Talent Acquisition Partner** to move forward.

* I submitted the application the same day and also replied with a confirmation email, attaching my resume and expressing my interest in the position.

**Now it’s Tuesday (after the weekend), and I haven’t received any update.

* Does the expired link mean anything concerning if I already submitted my application?

I know that more research needs to be done in this area, but there is at least one study out there that says at least preliminarily that Zep/tirz helps with alcohol addiction. I have seen story after story of people who are on this med that say they used to drink a lot and now they don’t want alcohol any more. There are countless anecdotal stories of people with personally admitted alcohol problems/addictions who are saying they’ve completely quit drinking with this medication. 

While reading these forums I’ve read stories of people who’ve controlled their use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. I’ve read stories of people who’ve controlled their intake of caffeine, coffee, and energy drinks. I’ve seen people who’ve stated they’ve been able to control their gambling and shopping/spending while on this medication. 

I know that it’s a sensitive topic and I appreciate anyone who answers. I was wondering if anyone has noticed a difference in their personal consumption of pornography? In this day and age there is a lot of talk of pornography addictions causing issues for people. 

Has anyone curbed their use of pornography while on this medication? Has it helped you with a self identified “problem” of overuse of pornography?

Looking for some advice,"I’m a 43F lesbian. I’ve been going to a yoga class for about a year. A woman who is quite a lot younger than me (25F) has been going there since a few months ago. Since she started, she has been going out of her way to talk to me. I haven’t noticed her talking to anyone else since she’s been there. It started out with her just chatting to me about mundane daily life things, but she has recently started complimenting me about my appearance. She has told me I have very nice hair and nails, and has also asked me about my skincare routine. She is also into wellness and keeping healthy, which is another thing we have talked about. She’s been blushing when she talks to me, and I think I have been blushing too. I’ve also noticed her smiling at me a few times during the class itself. I’m getting the impression that she is flirting with me. It definitely feels like she is being more than just friendly and platonic. She also knows I'm a lesbian, and has told me she is as well. I’m flattered by the attention she is giving me and honestly, I look forward to seeing her and talking to her.

I’m thinking about asking her if she would like to meet up away from the class for a coffee or lunch. I’m actually a late bloomer myself (I didn’t come out until I was 40), and I’m unsure what the etiquette is for making the first move, particularly when there is an age gap involved. I think there’s a good chance she has more lesbian dating and relationship experience than me generally, even though she is a lot younger than me. I'm certainly sensing there is a mutual attraction between us though. Do you think I should just ask her, or just keep reciprocating her compliments and attention, and hoping she asks me?",4,1750794188.0,latebloomerlesbians,0,0.83,False

I just got an ECM Synchronika II with the Lucca Flow Control installed. I'm trying to understand what the expected flow rate is when the valve is fully open and there's no coffee in the portafilter (i.e., water-only test into a scale).

From what I’ve read:

Stock ECM Synchronika (no flow control) should deliver around 10 g/sec (i.e., 250 mL in 25 seconds), due to its rotary pump.

With Lucca Flow Control installed, even when fully open, some users report a reduced rate of about 6–8 g/sec due to the needle valve introducing slight restriction — even at its max open position.

Is that statement accurate?

I did a test and got 7 grams per second.

Is this normal? What’s your experience with:

Flow rate in grams/second with flow control fully open.

Whether your paddle hits the body (limiting how open it gets) as mine does.

Any mods or fixes you’ve done to improve it?

Appreciate any input — trying to figure out if my flow control is performing as expected or if it needs adjustment.

1ljku2r,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2006/08/13/the-enduring-agony-of-a-pit-bull-rampage-3/,"The enduring agony of a pit bull rampage. Originally Published August 13, 2006.","“Brooks Foley heard a soft whimper and stopped still in the hallway. The sound was barely audible at first over the hiss of a shower, but it grew louder and louder until it was a heartbreaking sob.

His 10-year-old son was falling apart.

Four months had passed since the rain-soaked November afternoon outside of Cary when a neighbor’s three pit bulls attacked Nick Foley. The dogs tore pounds of flesh from his arms and legs. They broke bones, slashed nerves, spilled half of his blood onto the wet grass.

With painstaking work, trauma surgeons had saved Nick’s life and therapists had helped him regain much of the use of his body. His spirit, it seemed, had recovered as well: Most of the time he acted like the same goofy 5th-grader he had been before the attack.

“But he wasn’t the same. Chunks of muscle were missing from his limbs, leaving bone-deep divots papered over with grafted skin. The left side of his face bore two thick, half-moon scars where his cheek had been ripped open like a tent flap. And a specialist had just told the family that Nick’s right hand, the one he used to hold a pen and throw a baseball, might never work properly again.

It was too much. In the isolation of the shower, unable to shield his eyes from the damage, Nick cried out:”

“If it’s not going to get better, why should I have this arm? I want to chop it off. I wish I could set it on fire.”

Brooks understood. The dogs had gone after him, too, savaging his legs and right forearm so badly that he had retreated. He still suffered from flashbacks, tremors and a tormenting, complicated guilt. Sometimes he cried so hard that he couldn’t move.”

“Brooks went into the bathroom and tried to comfort his shivering son, to make him believe that everything would be all right. He just wasn’t sure he believed it himself.

So it went throughout the family, throughout the entire stunned neighborhood. The trauma of that day changed everyone it touched, ending friendships, straining family bonds, casting a cloak of fear over a once-relaxed northwest suburban community.

Much of the story was untold before now.

And it all began with a knock on a door.

On the drizzly afternoon of Saturday, Nov. 5, Jourdan Lamarre came to the doorstep of the Foley house.

She was a spirited 10-year-old with coffee-colored eyes and a pageboy haircut who lived across the street. She asked if Nick could help her sell Girl Scout candy and wrapping paper. Just a few more buyers and she’d earn a prize.

“Only go to homes you know,” cautioned Polly Foley, Nick’s mother.

That was just about all of them. The neighborhood, an aging collection of ranches and two-stories a mile north of Cary, was the sort of place where someone would plow the next-door driveway just to be nice, or drop by to chat over a cup of coffee.

In 1998, Brooks and Polly Foley bought a beige split-level on Hunters Path as their first house, thrilled to finally sink roots in a community. Life had been a whirl from the moment the two devoted Catholics had met at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Wash.

He was from Virginia, the son of a career Marine, cool and brainy on the surface, compassionate and vulnerable underneath. She was from Nebraska, earthy and striking, with untamable black curls and a boisterous laugh that could fill a room.

They had married their junior year and two years later had their first child, Maureen, a witty, red-haired girl. Two more children–slender, introspective Alex and chunky, attention-grabbing Nick–soon followed, and the family moved wherever Brooks’ software engineering job led them.

It was here, in McHenry County, that they finally grabbed hold of the suburban dream. They got the house, the back yard, even the dog–a pitch-black Labrador retriever mix named Java, a gift from a family friend. A dog seemed like a natural addition: Practically everyone in the neighborhood had one.

That included Scott Sword. A former tavern owner who hustled odd jobs for a living, he was tall and bulky, carrying 320 pounds that was more brawn than fat. Despite his intimidating size, he often came across as an overgrown kid, his voice crackling with boyish enthusiasm whenever he told a story.

Sword lived one street away from the Foleys, on Hawthorne Drive, in a shoebox of a house that seemed barely large enough for him, let alone his partner, Cathy Doyle, their son and daughter and a pit bull named Good Girl.

Sword got the dog eight years earlier, when a stranger entered his bar and offered him a puppy. The 8-week-old with a rust-colored coat was no purebred–it was later determined that she was a mix, perhaps with a splash of the Italian hunting breed Cane Corso in her background–but she was adorable. Sword and Doyle had no reservations about taking her into their home.

They named her Good Girl for her even temper and unwavering obedience. She was always around when Nick dropped by to play with Sword’s son, Max. The boys had been good friends for about a year and a half, riding bikes or playing Nintendo, and Good Girl seemed to accept Nick as one of the family.

Always looking to pick up extra money, Sword eventually mated Good Girl with a neighbor’s pit bull across the street. She had seven floppy-eared puppies, and Sword and Doyle sold five for about $90 each. They kept two white-coated pups for their kids, naming the female Stella and the male Petey, after “The Little Rascals” mascot he so strongly resembled.

Nick loved the dogs’ frenzied energy. He and Max would play with them, coaxing them to leap up and snatch sticks the boys dangled in the air. The puppies even came to follow Nick’s commands, meekly accepting a tap on the nose and a stern “No” when they tried to seize his Popsicle.

Nick’s parents knew of pit bulls’ reputation for violence and were nervous about Nick playing with them. But they accepted his reassurances that the dogs were well behaved.

What they didn’t know, what Nick didn’t know, was that Petey was developing a temper as he grew. He was barking and snapping at strangers, behavior that continued even after he was neutered.

In October, when Petey was a year old and a solid 75 pounds, a trainer dismissed him from obedience school, saying he was too volatile for a group lesson. Doyle brought him back for a private session, but the trainer, believing Petey was showing aggressive tendencies, refused to take the leash. Doyle vowed to the trainer that if Petey didn’t improve, she would have the dog destroyed.

One week later, Jourdan came to the Foleys’ house. Homebound all day because of the rain, Nick was eager to join her. He slipped a hooded jacket over his T-shirt and sweatpants and bolted outside.

About 4:20 p.m., ducking raindrops, they came to Scott Sword’s place. As they walked up the driveway to the side door, Jourdan would later recall, they heard growling. She hesitated but Nick reassured her.

“It’s OK,” he said. “I know these dogs.”

He didn’t, of course.

Pit bulls have a legacy of violence in their genes, and even some who think the dogs aren’t inherently aggressive compare them to loaded guns.

They first appeared in the 19th Century when English gamblers, seeking an ideal specimen for the dog-fighting pits, combined the strength of a bulldog with the endurance of a terrier. The resulting mix, refined over time, was short but incredibly muscular, its tapered head equipped with powerful jaws. Above all, the dog was “game”: It had the will to keep fighting until death.

The pit bull made its way to America, where blood sport enthusiasts marveled at its tenacity. In his memoir, dogfighter George C. Armitage wistfully recalled a 1916 match in which “the side boards of the pit were covered with blood, and the dogs were wrestling and tumbling all over the pit, with never the sign of a turn, or a let up in the speed.”

That hostility was meant to be directed solely at other animals–owners routinely killed pit bulls that attacked their handlers–but experts say that over the last 20 years, drug dealers, gangbangers and macho types have sought out “man eaters” to protect criminal enterprises or act as intimidating status symbols.

Kennel clubs recognize purebred strains such as the American Pit Bull Terrier and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, but mixed breeds that share their characteristics are also generally called pit bulls. Combined, the dogs killed 76 people between 1979 and 1998, more than any other type, according to a study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.

Defenders say that’s due more to popularity–there are perhaps 4.8 million in the U.S. today, among the most of any kind of dog–than to any built-in ferocity.”

  


“Randall Lockwood of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, who has studied dangerous dogs for three decades, said the vast majority of pit bulls are docile, but others are descended from hard-core attack dogs. If an owner hasn’t tracked the lineage of both parents, he said, “Who knows where the breeding stock comes from?”

Sword knew nothing about Good Girl’s background or that of the pit bull that fathered Petey and Stella. But aside from Petey’s occasional belligerence, Sword had never seen any problems. As Nick and Jourdan approached his door, which was closed but not latched, he was watching TV with the dogs stretched out nearby.

A small fist rapped on the door. It opened a crack.

Instantly, the tiny house was a riot of barking so loud and stabbing that it hurt Sword’s ears. All three dogs scrambled toward the door, their nails clicking and sliding on the kitchen’s linoleum floor.

Good Girl and Stella slipped through the doorway, but Sword managed to tackle Petey. He felt a flash of relief until the dog whipped its head around and snapped.

Sword’s thumb was nearly severed. He lost his grip, and Petey broke free.

Outside, Jourdan and Nick ran screaming when the first two dogs exploded through the doorway, followed seconds later by Petey. Together the animals knocked Jourdan down, tore through her two jackets and savaged her waist and left leg.

Nick, who had made it behind a tree, returned to reach into the storm of teeth and claws, trying to pull his friend to her feet.

“Stand up! Stand up!” he shouted.

Frozen with fear, Jourdan would not move.

“No!” she said. “No! No!”

Nick tried to go for help as Sword, bleeding heavily, peeled the dogs off the girl. Jourdan scrambled to her feet and ran away, and in a blink, Petey was on Nick’s heels. The boy didn’t get 20 feet before all three pit bulls took him down.

Sword tried again to pull the dogs away, even biting Petey’s face so hard that he broke off the gold cap from a tooth. But the animals seemed lost in a blood lust, wriggling from Sword’s grasp and clamping onto Nick’s arms and legs.

Sword lifted Nick in a bear hug and turned in circles, trying to keep him out of the dogs’ range, but they leaped at the boy, tearing bits of flesh with every jump. As Sword tired, the animals latched onto Nick’s arms. Sword felt Nick’s bones snap.

Exhausted, Sword slipped on the grass and toppled over. He rolled onto Nick, trying to protect him, but the dogs kept boring into the boy, stripping muscle from his arms and legs. Suddenly, though, they disappeared.

Sword lay there, falling in and out of consciousness. Then from beneath his body came a small, spookily calm voice:

“Mr. Sword, could you please get off me?”

Nick was left facedown in the mud. He felt no pain as the grass beneath him turned red. He was thinking that if he sat up and tried to touch his arm, his hand would pass through like vapor.

Am I a ghost? he wondered.

The idea jolted Nick into silent panic. Another thought fluttered through his mind:

Am I going to heaven or hell?

  
“Polly, a teacher, was grading papers in her family room when she thought that somebody needed to round up her son.

The Foleys had 6 p.m. dinner reservations at a Schaumburg fondue restaurant to celebrate Alex’s 13th birthday. It was about 4:40 p.m., and the light was slipping away fast.

Polly peered through the big living room picture window to Jourdan’s house across the street. An ambulance and firetruck were parked in front. Maybe Ed Lamarre, Jourdan’s father, had thrown his back out again.

“Nick doesn’t need to be there,” Polly told Brooks. “Why don’t you go get him?”

Ed Lamarre had dialed 911 after Jourdan had come home screaming, her left leg flayed open. The paramedics had responded quickly, but the girl, in shock, didn’t tell them about Sword and Nick.

Brooks knocked on his neighbor’s door. Ed Lamarre answered, staring without expression as Brooks asked for his son.

“He’s not home?” Lamarre said. “Jourdan’s just been bit by three dogs on Hawthorne.”

Three dogs on Hawthorne. The pit bulls.

Brooks began walking on numb legs, then broke into a trot, his eyes darting left and right. He turned the corner onto Hawthorne and through the gloom saw a massive human shape sprawled on a lawn.

Brooks knew it was Sword. But an instant later he noticed the dogs gnawing on the ankles of someone who lay underneath the big man. They were tugging at a pair of sweatpants as if wrestling a chew toy.

As Brooks peered into the murk, his mind swirling with fear, the faintest outline of a thought formed in his head. The ankles, those sweatpants …

Nick?

But before his brain could complete the idea, before he could call out or take a step, the dogs charged. Without a sound, they were on him.

Good Girl clamped her jaw around his right forearm, digging deep into muscle as the other dogs bit his legs. He punched Good Girl square in the face repeatedly, but she only growled and tightened her grip.

“Stop!” Brooks screamed. “Stop!”

Until that moment, no one else in the neighborhood had seen what was happening. Some heard barking and shrieking but figured it was only the sound of kids and dogs playing.

Brooks’ shouts finally roused their attention. Deborah Rivera saw the dogs and went to the end of her driveway, banging a heavy frying pan with a metal spoon. Gerd Gerdes and Jim Dunn ran to the skirmish with baseball bats and swung hard at the pit bulls’ heads.

“\[The dogs\] were possessed,” Rivera recalled. “\[The bats\] would knock them down, and like cartoon characters, they would shake their heads then go right back to biting even worse.”

The pit bulls ripped at the men’s legs. At last, though, the dogs retreated a few yards, making wide circles around the bodies lying in the grass.

As Gerdes and Dunn stood guard, Brooks remembered the ambulance parked at the Lamarres’ house. He wrapped what was left of his shirt around his mangled arm and staggered home to get help.

The half-thought that had been forming was gone. That wasn’t Nick on the lawn. It couldn’t be. His son was still out there.”

  
“Reaching his house, he opened a door and shouted, “Go find Nick! Go find Nick!” Then he crossed the street and slumped down on the bumper of the ambulance that had come for Jourdan. He was pale, breathing heavily. His jeans were shredded. Deep wounds criss-crossed his arm.

Polly moved toward her husband, but he put up a hand and yelled once more for her to find their son. The pit bulls were on a rampage, he said, and Nick was missing.

Polly rushed to Hawthorne Drive, screaming Nick’s name in a voice she didn’t recognize. More than a half hour had elapsed since the attacks began. A woman who had happened upon the scene in her SUV was on the phone with 911 dispatchers when she saw Polly walk past.

“Lady! Lady!” the woman called out. “Will you please get in my truck?”

Ignoring her, Polly moved toward the shapes on the lawn. One of them had short legs. The thick brown hair was matted with rain and blood. Polly’s eyes traced the familiar curve of the hairline and the straight line of the little nose, a near match of her husband’s.

“Oh my God,” she cried. “That’s my son, that’s my son, that’s my son …”

She saw Nick’s back rise and fall and knew he was alive. He slowly turned his head and his left cheek flapped open.

Polly, always squeamish at the sight of blood, willed herself not to faint.

Before she could get closer, two of the pit bulls returned. They circled Sword and Nick, sniffing at them, but their eyes were locked on Polly. She slowly stepped back. The dogs left, silently vanishing into the darkness.

“Mom’s here, Nick,” she called out. “I’m not going to leave you. Mom’s here.”

Polly dropped to her knees and whispered a desperate prayer.

“You gotta help me, Jesus. You gotta help me.”

At 4:50 p.m., McHenry County Deputies Kyle Mandernack and Ed Maldonado were asked to respond to a dog bite on Hawthorne Drive. Routine business, they thought. But six minutes later, when they arrived at Sword’s house, they saw men with baseball bats, horrified neighbors and, on a lawn, two bloody figures.

The Cary Fire Department and ambulance crews were already there. Matt Hanus, who lived three blocks away, was using his pickup truck to barricade the dogs in Sword’s house, where they had retreated. Hanus revved the engine and honked the horn whenever one appeared in the doorway, trying to frighten it back inside.

Paramedic Sue Pencava was first to reach Nick. She asked him if he was in any pain. He said no.

Pencava was amazed. She’d seen many terrible injuries on the job and knew full well how the body reacted to shock. But Nick’s calm was beyond any explanation she could imagine, save one.

“I just felt that God had taken him to a special spot away from all the pain,” she said later.

Handguns drawn, the deputies emerged from their cars and devised a quick plan: If the pit bulls stayed in the house, they’d wait for Animal Control. If the dogs came out and offered a clear shot, they’d try to kill them.

The deputies jumped into the bed of the pickup truck, switched to heavier weapons–a slug-firing shotgun and a CAR-15 assault rifle–and waited.

With the front yard momentarily clear, the paramedics loaded Sword into one ambulance, and after rolling Nick in a sheet, lifted the boy into another.

“Where are you taking him?” Polly demanded.

“Who are you?” one of the paramedics asked.

“I’m his mother.”

“Is he allergic to anything?”

“No.”

Polly had only a moment to tell her son that she would see him at the hospital before the paramedics slammed the doors and pulled away.

For 45 minutes, the pit bulls scuttled in and out of the house, venturing only a few feet from the doorway before turning back under a barrage of air horns and sirens. Finally, Petey rushed the truck.

“I have to take this shot!” Mandernack shouted, pulling the trigger. A 2-inch lead slug tore through Petey’s chest. Wounded, he lurched away.

The other pit bulls charged. Maldonado shot Stella, and she reeled into Sword’s back yard and crumpled to the ground.”

“Mandernack fired, hitting Good Girl. She ran down Hawthorne Drive before a Cary police officer shot her again. She fell down but struggled to get to her feet.

“It was still growling and snapping and showing its teeth, the whole nine yards,” Mandernack recalled. “When it got up, that’s when I took the final shot and put it down completely.”

The only dog left was the injured Petey. Mandernack soon found him one street away, pitifully scratching at a front door as if asking to come inside. Mandernack killed him with a shotgun blast.

The echo of the final shot died away about 5:43 p.m., almost an hour and a half after Nick and Jourdan had knocked on Sword’s door.

A knot of people formed in the middle of Hawthorne Drive, their faces illuminated by police spotlights. Six of their neighbors had just been taken away by ambulances. One of them, they had heard, might die.

They asked police repeatedly for more information and traded eyewitness accounts. They told a gaggle of reporters that their neighborhood was friendly and close-knit, but away from the cameras the first stirrings of discord surfaced.

(Long read)  


Most of them had known Sword’s dogs. The pit bulls had never been the subject of Animal Control complaints, and some insisted they had always seemed sweet-tempered, wagging their tails around other people and pets.

But with the blood still slick on the lawn, others contended the dogs had sometimes appeared uncontrollable, roaming unleashed on Hawthorne as Sword unsuccessfully tried to wrangle them inside.

A chill had descended with the night. Nobody was sure what had happened, or what might come next. There were still plenty of dogs in the neighborhood.

And some of them were pit bulls.

The ambulance bearing Nick sped toward Advocate Good Shepherd Hospital near Barrington. He was there within 16 minutes, wheeled into the emergency room with blood soaking through his sheet.

Dr. Stephen Rivard, a seasoned ER veteran, had stayed past his shift to determine whether Nick’s injuries were serious enough to warrant a transfer to a Level One trauma hospital, which handles the most desperate cases.

He unraveled Nick’s bandages and gasped.

The answer was obvious. Good Shepherd wasn’t set up to handle this. Nick would have to go to Advocate Lutheran General in Park Ridge, the closest hospital with a major trauma center.

First, though, the doctors and nurses stabilized Nick. They put an IV line beneath his collarbone–his arms were too damaged–to give him fluids, blood and painkillers. They cleaned his wounds and wrapped him tightly in soft bandages so that only his mouth and eyes remained uncovered.

Nick remained quiet. He was awake, alone and terrified, but his composure astounded the men and women trying to save his life.

“He didn’t say, \`Where am I going? Where’s my mom?’ all the things he should have said,” Rivard recalled.

As he was pushed from the ER on a gurney, Nick opened his eyes, looked up and said: “Thank you.”

The doctors and nurses waited until the ambulance had left. Then they walked to an empty bay, closed the curtain and wept.

1ljkqa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UAE/comments/1ljkqa2/spoiled_kids/,Spoiled kids,"I was working at a Caribou Coffee shop today when, at some point, a large group of teenagers came in.

They were SO loud, swearing constantly, putting their feet up on the tables, and acting absolutely disrespectful to everyone around them.

When the barista politely asked them to behave, they were incredibly rude to her — started yelling and arguing back.
She told them they were being too loud, taking up a huge amount of space without even ordering anything, and disturbing other customers.

All the adults sitting there were shocked. One British lady also spoke up and supported the barista, backing her up.

Later on, the same group of kids went into a nearby supermarket and started shouting and yelling all over the place.
I couldn’t take it anymore and called out one of the boys in their group.

He immediately started arguing with me, saying something along the lines of “we’re just kids.”

People in the store were clearly annoyed too and several others also confronted them about their behavior.

And here’s the thing — part of that group were Europeans.
Have some of these European parents really lost their sense of responsibility?
Forgotten how to raise their children with basic manners and respect for others?

Shouldn’t children be taught not to put their dirty, smelly feet on tables where people eat?
It’s absolutely disgusting.

Or maybe parenting duties have just been comfortably outsourced to a nanny?

A buddy in the trade keeps complaining about two massive time-sucks:

1. **After-hours customer calls** that pull you away from family/dinner/sleep just to book a basic appointment.
2. **New techs blowing up your phone** with questions that *should* be in the manuals (but who has time to flip through those on a job?).

**What if software could handle both?**

* **Auto-call assistant**: Answers calls, books appointments, and even reschedules—no human needed for the simple stuff. (You finally mute your phone after 7PM.)
* **Chatbot for techs**: Trained on manuals from major brands (Carrier, Trane, etc.). Young techs ask it first—""What’s the torque spec for this Lennox valve?""—instead of calling you mid-dinner.

**Serious question**: Would this actually help your shop, or is it solving the wrong problem? Be brutally honest—I’m a dev, not an HVAC pro, and I don’t want to build something useless.

I sighed softly in relief. I wasn't sure what was in the message she just got, or who sent it, but it seemed to soften her demeanor some. I was still trying to figure out why my hand was trembling, and just how to stop it. For the time being, I kept my hands clasped together in my lap. I looked around, taking in the crowd of people shuffling by, seeing the ever-present Ironclad security force on their patrols, and hearing the inane chatter of the people. There was an *itch* between my shoulders I couldn't quite scratch—instinctive, not physical.

I did my best to shrug it off and focus on the conversation I was having with Angela. ""Well... It's not much to tell, but I think that if our lives could be lost so quickly, that it only serves to reason that we try to *enjoy* it more, you know?"" I squirmed a bit in my seat, an odd feeling building in my chest.

Angela nodded. ""I think that's a *fantastic* thing, Ozzy. We absolutely *should* enjoy our lives more. We were luckier than most of the rest of the people. If memory serves me, I think only *one* person survived besides us, and we weren't listed in the roster as having attended that day for some reason.""

I cast a quick glance to my left, seeing the same Ironclad Sentinel that had been there for forty-five minutes. Why was he staring at us? ""Yeah, but I think she died on Friday. Even after LibertyForge and Vanguard spent hundreds of millions in an attempt to save her.""

*Ozzy? Are you okay? Your stress levels are rising.*

*{The Sentinel to our left has been staring at us for forty-five minutes! Why?}*

*That's odd. Give me a moment............. You need to leave. Both of you.*

*{What? Why?}*

*Make up any excuse and leave. Now, please. And quietly.*

Angela sipped her coffee, a thoughtful expression on her face. ""I'd heard that. Pretty sad that she did.""

I leaned toward her and softly spoke, ""Um... I'm not feeling too great out here around all these people, Angela. I keep thinking *something* will happen again. Is there somewhere else we could go?""

She leaned in, her face radiating worry. ""What's wrong, Ozzy? I mean, yes. My home is just a short train ride from here. Would that be okay?""

I nodded and moved to stand. ""Yes. I-I'm sorry, Angela.""

She snorted and waved her hand, then punched something into her phone. ""Don't you dare. It's absolutely okay, and to be honest, I was feeling a little antsy, myself. Shall we?"" She stood and gestured toward the train.

I nodded and walked beside her, beginning to feel somewhat better. With her nearly a foot shorter than me, I had to adjust my stride to keep pace.

*There is a crowd of people coming up behind you. Try to get in the middle of them, and stay with them.*

*{Okay. I don't understand, but please tell me when you think we're safe from whatever it is you've found.}*

*Absolutely.*

True to Nova's word, a crowd swept up from behind, moving a *little* faster than us, and I put an arm around Angela's shoulders, keeping her close as we matched their pace. I heard a soft intake of breath when I did it, but reasoned that she would have pushed me away had I crossed a line. Instead, she seemed to *lean in* a little bit. I didn't know what it meant, but as long as we were both moving, I didn't care. A few moments later, and part of the group split off and went down a street while the rest of us continued to the train station. I followed the periodic commands from Nova, managing to keep us roughly in the middle of everyone until we got to the busy station.

Angela tugged me toward a sign, and pulled my head down to make sure she was heard. ""Looks like we have a five minute wait. Will you be okay? There's a *lot* more people here, Ozzy.""

I looked around slowly, not seeing any Sentinels nearby. ""I *think* so? That weird feeling I was having is gone, at least.""

""Good."" She patted my arm. She looked up at me with a smile. ""That was *nice*.""

I cocked my head. ""Huh? What was?""

A soft laugh bubbled up from her. ""The way you put your arm around me. It felt...*nice*. Like you were there to keep things from happening.""

""I mean... Kinda?"" I ran my good hand through my hair. ""I didn't want anything to happen to *either* of us, so... yeah.""

*I have performed a full scan of your surroundings. There are no Sentinels or drones in quite a distance. You are safe.*

*{Thanks, Nova. Why did we leave like that, though?}*

*Because that Sentinel was watching you two, and* ***only*** *you two. When you left, he followed at a distance that* ***most*** *AI assistants cannot detect. My sensor package appears to be different than most, and I could easily track him. You lost him when the group split.*

*{Oh shit. Anything else? Any idea why?}*

*I have a theory, and you won't like it. Neither of you will, and yes, you will need to tell Angela.*

*{Let's wait until we get to her house.}*

We stood there, near the front of the platform, Angela pressed to my side and my arm over her shoulders, looking for all the world like the most awkward couple ever. I was too *terrified* to move, and she seemed lost in a daydream. A couple of minutes later, the train sped into the station and stopped. The doors on the opposite side opened and hundreds of people exited, chattering away. The entry doors opened and we all boarded, taking a seat or standing, as we felt necessary. Angela and I took a pair of seats next to the door, and a few minutes later, the train sped off at a blistering two hundred miles per hour.

We sat quietly, watching the scenery fly by, hearing hushed conversations from other passengers and I finally felt a bit safer. Still a touch anxious, as I had no idea what Nova was going to drop on us in a few minutes.

Three stops later, Angela patted my hand, snapping me from my daydreams. She stood, and I rose with her. Slowly the train came to a stop, and we left through the exit doors. She silently led the way to her house, and I followed, feeling a little comforted that Nova hadn't alerted me to anything *new*. A few minutes later, and Angela had closed the front door behind us.

""Welcome to my home, Ozzy. If I'd even *thought* I'd be bringing you back here, I'd have cleaned a bit better. Are you feeling better? Can I get you something to drink?""

I shook my head and felt a rumbling from deep inside me. ""No thank you. Um... Where is the bathroom?""

""Ah. Coffee. Right. It's down the hall to your left.""

I went to the bathroom, surprised by the sudden urgency. When I returned, Angela had seated herself on the couch, a couple of glasses of water on the small table. ""Sorry.""

""No, you're fine. I should have warned you. Coffee also helps you *go*. There's no predictability to it, but it's there. Please, sit.""

I sat on the end of the couch, away from her, leaning my elbows on my knees. I was about to open my mouth, when I heard Nova's voice come through the speakers in the house.

*Hello, Angela. I am Nova, Ozzy's Assistant.*

Startled, we both looked around.

""Nova? How did you get in her system?""

*I'll explain in a moment. Suffice to say, it was trivial. There has been a...development. Ozzy, that so-called itch you were feeling? You two were being watched by one of the Sentinels. Unfortunately, I have itentified him as having been at the church when it was attacked.*

""What? How is that possible? Ozzy and I are the *only* other survivors.""

""She's right, Nova. The other survivor died on Friday.""

There was a momentary pause. *I didn't say he was a survivor.*

My eyes went wide, and I looked over at Angela. Her mouth was open.

*You understand, then. Good. Yes, I believe that ten members of the Sentinels executed the attack on the church that maimed you, Ozzy, and wounded you terribly, Angela. I have positively identified the man thanks to a tattoo on his hand. It was* **not** *an act of the Nullborn.*

I sat back on the couch. Ironclad did this? Why? What was the use? ""But... *why*? What purpose could there be in attacking the church? We were *harmless*!""

*I do not have sufficient data to answer that question. Angela, you should know that you are now* **both** *likely to be under tighter scrutiny for quite some time. I would suggest continuing as you have been. Pay your bills, work your shifts, and above all else -* ***do nothing suspicious.***

I sighed. This was getting real old, real quick. Angela spoke before I could.

""How do you know all this, Nova? How did you break into my home security?""

*I simply asked your AI. Cosmo was quick to let me in.*

""Cosmo? Is this true?""

A second voice answered. It's tone was *markedly* different from Nova's. ""*Yes, ma'am. Nova is a class III-C AI. I am simply a class II-A. I must follow its commands. It has forbidden me from reporting this incident to AetherNet. I have been sending the usual callback pings, so that nothing is seen as amiss. Is this to your liking, Ma'am?*""

""Uh... Sure, Cosmo. That's fine."" Angela looked at me, and I could see the fear there.

I sighed. ""Nova, is this location secure? Are you positive none of this conversation will get to Aether?""

*Yes, Ozzy. Nothing said here will leave this location.*

I shifted on the couch, facing Angela, who had a throw pillow pressed against her middle. ""There's something you should know..."" And I told her *everything*. From getting the HoloFrames, to having them ""upgraded"", even that the Nullborn lived among us, quietly going about their lives, trading tech for favors and information, though I refused to tell her who it was that I knew among them.

""...and here we are. You wanted to know what hope I found? It's *them*, Angela. The Nullborn. And I'm going to help them however I can. You can either turn me in or not; it really doesn't matter at this point. The system is going to come for us, *regardless*. Once that Sentinel relays what he's seen to headquarters, our days are most likely numbered.""

*There* ***is*** *another possibility, Ozzy. His superiors may simply remove* ***him****. I would bet that their orders were to eliminate the entirety of the churchgoers. Failures are not taken lightly at Ironclad. Either that, or they will do nothing. Neither of you exhibited any outward suspicion, so he might also say nothing, knowing the potential consequences. I still recommend caution, however. If, after a couple of months, nothing happens, I would say you are in the clear.*

I nodded along with Nova's explanation. Made sense, after all. ""Think you can do that, Angela?""

Angela shook her head, clearing the cobwebs in her mind. "" Yeah. Be boring for a couple months. Sure. No problem.""

""You okay?""

""I'm just trying to take it all in, Ozzy. It's a crazy story, to be sure. I didn't even know class III-C AI *existed*.""

""Yeah... sometimes even *I* can't believe all this. But I'm here. *Living it*. I even have access to *music*, now.""

Angela's face brightened. ""*Music*? I've not heard it since I was a little girl.""

*Shall I play the same piece that was your first, Ozzy?*

I smiled, knowing what was coming. ""Yeah. I think that's a good idea, Nova. Just make sure nobody else can hear it.""",1,1750793772.0,Words_From_Ivor,0,1.0,False

1ljkm1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/bicornuateuterus/comments/1ljkm1p/not_enough_weight_gain_and_major_fatigue/,Not Enough Weight Gain and MAJOR fatigue?,"Hello, I'm 32 and this is my first pregnancy at 20 weeks pregnant and have gained about 3 lbs. A little stats on myself before pregnancy. I've been about 103-107lbs all my adult life and it just happens right before my trip I was traveling and walking a lot so I was at my lower weight of 103. I easily fluctuated about 3 lbs throughout a week. I'm 5'-1"" and lived a fairly average lifestyle of diet and exercise with no known medical conditions prior. I also was not an avid caffeine person as I was sensitive to coffee prior.  
  
At 4-5 weeks I had some bleeding so I saw my OB earlier after a visit to the ER and was diagnosed with BU. Nothing's changed with my diet and I actually do eat more throughout the day than I've ever before but I've had major fatigue, so much that I'm barely moving and have been living on my couch/bed, even in my second trimester. I had some mild nausea during first trimester but not enough to throw up regularly, more like dry heaving. I don't normally weigh myself and bc I've been too concerned with my bicornuate uterus I didn't want to add another worry to my pregnancy. I also feel so heavy and uncomfortable (for what I'm used to) and I have a protruding belly that has graduated me out of my clothes so I really didn't think I had an issue gaining weight until my recent visit at 16 weeks.   
  
My OB asked if I was feeling nauseous or if I had trouble eating. I said no, I was eating more frequently, and she said now that I'm in my second trimester (last time I saw my OB was at 13 weeks) she said I'll probably start to gain more weight and noted I had so far only gained 3lbs and was 106lbs. I saw an MFM for the first time for my 18 week anatomy scan who didn't comment on my weight (nor did I get weighed or measured but they wrote in my patient portal that I was '103 lbs and 5'3"" which is both untrue) but said the baby is around the 50% percentile so I don't think she was concerned but I was still the same weight from my 16 week appt and same now. They did catch that I had placenta previa but everything else seemed fine and baby was good. My weight hasn't really fluctuated much either since getting pregnant. I'm currently 106.4 consistently to the decimal..   
  
However, my major concern is I've been super super tired all the time since my pregnancy and second trimester hasn't made things easier, so I'm wondering if I should be worried about my lack of weight gain may be due to a not normal amount of fatigue caused by something.. Thank God the baby is fine but is there something wrong with me that I'm so tired that I'm needing more food but that food is going elsewhere other? I def eat well over 1500 calories a day and I know a lot of it is going to the baby too but I know there's a lot of other risks that BU puts you at and so I'm wondering if anyone's experienced something similar. I've never experienced such fatigue before and it seems to be getting worse.   
  
This sounds so bad, but I honestly feel like I have loveable parasite inside me. I hate to refer to the baby that way and I am beyond grateful the baby is healthy and growing (was super nervous after my 16 week appt for my anatomy scan at 20 weeks), but I literally feel so not like myself. I feel like it's messing with my mental health as well. The cabin fever and me wrestling with getting out of bed but yet my body not being able to follow. I keep telling myself it's the last time I'll have the freedom to go out and enjoy life but I feel like I've already lost that. The weight is honestly maybe not my worry but just what's going on with me and how I feel.. the numbers just put a measurable scale to what is ""normal""..

That was what brought me into Captain Cluckey's that evening. I stood there in line behind 
two middle aged women who were taking a rather long time to place their order. Where is 
my mind by the Pixies played over the restaurant speakers. Over the music I could hear the
man in the dirty ragged clothes out front, still yelling about the end of days. I did my best to 
ignore him, just like everyone else. I turned back to look out the window, past the ragged 
man and across the street to the bus station. I thought about how I should have been out of 
this backwoods town and on my way back to Chicago by now. 

Unfortunately, my car had 
broken down a mile outside of the town of Pleasence. The town mechanic said he could 
have the part in sometime next week, but I had no intention of hanging around that long. 
Double unfortunately, the bus to the city didn't run until the next morning. So, for the time 
being, I was marooned here.

I glanced down at the receipt in my hand, the attached coupon read, Free regular fries with 
next purchase. I had gotten a Clucky combo meal earlier that day and with nothing else to 
do, I decided to grab my extra fries and loiter around town till morning. I was low on cash, 
so a room at the local motel wasn't in the cards.
I checked my watch, 7:35PM. “Only about 13 hours to go.” I thought to myself. I glanced up 
to the ladies ahead of me, still talking over their order. The door chimed behind me and a 
group of teenagers came in, laughing and talking loudly. I gave them a cursory glance and 
noticed one of them wore clothes that weren't quite in the style of the others, an old 
letterman jacket and jeans instead of the tee shirts and shorts the others wore. I noticed 
the bruising on his throat and made a note to myself to not make eye contact with that 
particular young man.

 I was sandwiched between the two chatty Kathys and the obnoxious 
teenagers and my social anxiety was climbing to a fever pitch. Not only that, but the 
nicotine itch was beginning to set in. I shrugged to myself and stepped out of line; I was in 
no hurry after all. 

Stepping out into the warm summer evening, I looked up orange and purple sky. The sky that
seemed so clear out here away from the city. I pulled my crumpled pack of cigarettes out 
of the pocket of my thrift store Hawaiian shirt as the ragged man continued his tirade a few 
feet away from me. I lit my cigarette and continued to ignore him. After a moment he 
noticed me and stepped over, directly in front of me. 

“THEY ARE HERE! YOU ALL MUST LEAVE THIS PLACE! DON’T YOU UNDERSTAND? THEY 
ARE BENEATH US! THEY ARE AMONG US! AND THEY WILL COME FOR YOU ALL! YOU 
THINK YOU KNOW THE TRUTH; YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT COMES AFTER BUT YOUARE ALL WRONG! ALL OF YOU! THEY WILL DEVOUR YOU! THEY WILL HOLLOW YOU OUT 
AND FILL YOU WITH HATRED AND ROT! ROT! ROT!

I inhaled the smoke and focused on the setting sun, doing my best to ignore the man's
putrid breath as he screamed in my face. I exhaled and watched the smoke drift through 
the man's face before calmly moving to lean against the restaurant wall. I didn't react to 
the man, didn't acknowledge him. I couldn't, if I did, he would never leave me alone.

Eventually he went back to his place on the sidewalk and started his speech all over again. 
I glanced over at him, standing there shouting, begging to be heard, preaching his heart out 
to an absent congregation. I pitied him, what he was. I wondered at the circumstances that 
brought him to that place.

After smoking another cigarette and doom scrolling on my phone for a few minutes, I went 
back inside and found that the line had dissipated. The cashier from earlier was gone, 
replaced by a pimple faced kid with a name tag that read, Jimmy. His head hung low as I 
approached the counter. Probably looking at his phone, I thought.

“Welcome to Captain Cluckey's, how may I help you?” 
His voice carried such melancholy that I assumed those other teens had been giving the 
poor kid a hard time. 

“I'll take a small soda and a free regular fries.” I said laying the coupon on the counter. 

The kid looked up at me slowly, his eyes finding mine and studying me for a moment. 

Suddenly his mouth dropped open in a dopey smile and he turned and headed back into 
the kitchen muttering something about being right back. I stood there, confused. “The hell 
was that about?” I wondered. 

After a few minutes, the cashier from earlier came out from the kitchen and saw me.
“Sorry about the wait sir, what can I get you?” He said stepping up to the counter.

I squinted and looked back to the kitchen, “What happened to the other guy?” 

“Other guy?” He asked. “What other guy?”

Then it hit me. “Shit.” I muttered under my breath.
I glanced around the restaurant. The chatty Kathys were nearby, watching me curiously. 

From their point of view, I had just placed my order to thin air. So, I looked like a crazy 
person. That was fine, maybe I was. Who the fuck cares. 

I looked back to the group of teens, they were still in their own world, still being obnoxious. 
But the out of place one, he was watching me now. I did my best not to meet his eyes, but I 
knew he could see me. He knew I could see him. I fucked up.

“Looks like it's time to go.” I thought. I turned to head for the door and saw the ragged man standing outside. I needed to compose myself before leaving, I was rattled. I needed to clear my head; be alone for a moment.

 In the bathroom I splashed water on my face and 
studied myself in the mirror. I looked older than my 25 years. My shaggy sandy blonde hair 
was now streaked with silver, and the lines on my face were more care worn than they 
once were.

“Hi there!” Came the voice from behind me.

Jimmy, the other cashier, was there. I tried to act like I didn't hear him, looked through him
when I turned around, tried all the usual tricks. But when I went to open the door, Jimmy stepped in my way, and I hesitated.

“I know you can see me.” He said, his eyes burrowing into mine.

Yeah, the jig was up. I do my best to avoid these situations, otherwise they never leave me 
alone, always seems to be just a little more unfinished business. I sighed, “What do you want?”

He laughed, “How?” He asked. “How can you see me? Can you see others?”

I shook my head, “Doesn't matter. I can see you, I can hear you. Tell me what you want or leave me alone.”

“Okay, Okay.” He said. “I'm sorry, I just... I haven't spoken to anyone in... Well, I'm not sure how long. Your car broke down right? It's a small town, people gossip, and all I can do is listen. Well, until now.” He smiled wide.

I nodded and made a get on with it motion. 

“Well, there are others here. They want what I want, maybe you can talk to them too? I’llgo...”

“No!” I demanded, grabbing his arm before he could leave. “No others, that's the deal. You already know, I can't change that. I help you and you never mention this to anyone else. 
Got it?”

He stared down at my hand on his arm, “Holy crap, you can actually touch me.” His eyes shot up to mine. 

“Thats the deal, got it?”He nodded, “Okay, I mean, yeah deal.”

I let go of him; icy pain was radiating up my arm from my hand. I’ll never get used to how it feels to touch the dead, they have substance but at the same time they don't. Like trying to hold on to frozen mist.

“So, what do you want?” I asked again.

He smiled, “Well, my name is Jimmy.” He said pointing at his nametag. “And I was murdered.” He turned to show me a series of stab wounds on his back. 

I nodded, “And you want me to find the killer, right?” 

“Oh, no.” He said, still smiling, “I know who it was. He got away with it, but he died a few months ago. Heart attack, and he saw me as he passed. It was very cathartic.”

“Okay. So, what do you want?” I asked.

“Weeell. Here’s the thing, and you might want to brace yourself because this is a big ask... What was your name by the way?”

“My name is Jonas.” I said. “Now please for the love of God, tell me what you want.”

“Oh, like the Weezer song, neat. Okay, well here goes. So, the man that killed me, also killed several other people around town, mostly just drifters and the like, no one who would be missed. Only he wasn't the only one. He was actually a member of some kind of cult
based here in Pleasence. I'm not sure what their practices or goals are, aside from killing 
lots of folks. But I do know that whatever they are planning, it will be coming to a head soon. I've heard lots of hushed talk about the new moon and rituals and a lot of other such stuff. I think they want to open some kind of doorway to somewhere, but I really can't be 
sure. You really never can tell with these culty types. So, my request is that you, Jonas, seek out the members of this cult and put a stop to whatever they're cooking up.” 

I took a breath and blew out my cheeks. “So, there's a cult?”

“Yes.”

“And they are doing something big on the new moon?”

He nodded, “Correct.” 

“Which is tonight.”

His smile faltered a little but didn't go away altogether, “Um, I guess so.""

I leaned back against the sink and crossed my arms, ""So, you want me; one mentally unstable guy, to find and stop a whole ass cult from opening up some kind of doorway or something? And you want me to do it tonight? Like right now? Does that about sum it up?”

His smile had completely melted away as I laid it all out. He said, “I mean, it sounds like a lot when you say it like that.”

“Goodbye Jimmy.” I said as I brushed past him and out the door.

Of course, he followed me, “Hey wait!” He yelled across the restaurant as I made my way to the exit.

“Don't follow me.” I said over my shoulder.

“Are you alright sir?” The cashier asked as I passed the counter. 

I ignored him and pushed through the door, also ignoring the still ranting ragged man on the sidewalk. If the kid was right and there really was some kind of cult here, doing something tonight. I wanted to get as far away from here as possible. I was halfway down the block when I heard the dead cashier calling out to me again.

“I know it's a lot, but what are the odds of you, of all people, showing up here right at this 
time. Thats either one heck of a coincidence or you are meant to be here. I believe you are 
here for a reason Jonas.”

I pulled out my phone and held it to my ear. If anyone happened to be watching, I was just 
taking a phone call, “I'm here because my car broke down, there is no other reason.Besides even if I wanted to help, it isn't possible. I don't know the first thing about dealing with cults or whatever. Now stop following me.”

“It is possible if we work together, if we have faith...”

“Faith?” I laughed, “Faith in what? In people? The universe? “God?”

“How can you not have faith? With your gift...”

“Gift? My Gift?” I said, cutting him off. “You wanna talk about gifts, about beliefs?” I shook my head, “Let me tell you a story. See, the original owner of the house I grew up in fell asleep with a lit cigarette in his hand. The house was almost a total loss, but my folks 
happened to come along and got the place for a steal. Would you like to take a guess which room he died in?” I asked. “Every night he stood the foot of my bed, tears running down burnt and blackened cheeks, going on and on about how he was a good Christian. How he 
shouldn't still be here. And when he found out I could see him...”

“What happened?” He asked. 

“He screamed, raged, begged me to help him, demanded I help him.”

“And did you?”

“I was 9 years old. What the fuck could I have done?”

Jimmy said nothing so I continued, “It wasn't long after that, he realized he could make 
physical contact with me.”

Jimmy winced.

“Yeah, now he had someone to take out all his anger and frustration on.”

“Didn't you tell your parents?” He asked.

“Of course I did, and they sent me to therapy. And therapy led to doctors, which led to
medication, then to psyche wards and institutions. No one believed me. Do you have any idea how many 
people die in those places? Do you think they move on when they do?” I shook my head, “I just thought the burned man was bad. Is that your idea of a gift?”

He began to speak, then trailed off.

“Yeah, I wouldn't know what to say either. You wanna know what I believe kid? I believe that God, if he's even still around, either hates us or doesn't give a shit about us anymore.”

‘Thats not true.” He said.

I chuckled, “Look at yourself kid, if you’re such a faithful believer, then why are you still here?”

“I don't know!” he shouted, “But there has to be a reason, I have to believe I'm here for something.”

I shrugged at him and turned to leave. “Sorry, kid. I'm all out of Faith.”

“Please, Jonas.” He continued. “Fine, don't do it for me, or faith or God or any of that. Do it for the innocents that haven't died yet. Please help me stop them from killing anyone else.”

I stopped. I didn't want to deal with this, didn't want to know about some cult in the middle of nowhere. But now I did, and if he was right, people could die tonight, innocent people. How would I feel if I could have stopped it and didn't? What would that kind of decision do to whatever is left of my own battered soul. Shouldn't I at least look into it and see if anything can be done. I sighed, “God dammit.”

Jimmy smiled when I turned around,“Where and when is this ritual happening?” I asked.

“So, you'll help?”

“I don't know. I don't know if there's anything I can do. But I have nothing else to do and nowhere to go so I might as well check it out. So, where's it happening?”

He shrugged, “I don't know for sure where, but it has to be happening soon right?”

I looked as the last rays of sunlight sank below the horizon, “Yeah, I'd say so. Okay, do you know of any other members of the cult? Where they live?”

Jimmy thought for a moment. “I know that Mr. Paterson, the school science teacher, and Greasy Bob, the guy who runs the gas station, are both members. I've heard them discussing some horrible things inside Cluckey's. But I've never been to where they live, you'd have to go without me.”

“Shit.” Funny thing about ghosts, if they had never been there when they were alive, they can't go there when they're dead. “No, if I'm doing this, I'll need someone watching my back.”

Just then flashing red and blue lights pulled up next to me and stopped. Jimmy stood there, his legs vanishing into the hood of the town sheriff's car.

“Evening son.” He said it friendly enough, though he eyed me suspiciously. 

“Evening.” I nodded back in greeting. “What can I do for you officer.”

He pushed an oversized cowboy hat up on his head, “Well we got a call about somebody out here by the Cluckey's having conversations with himself. Would you happen to know anything about that?”

I smiled, “Oh yeah, sorry about that. I must look like a crazy person. I was talking on the 
phone; I have a Bluetooth earpiece.” I said pointing at my ear, which was fortunately covered by my long hair.

The sheriff nodded, “Oh I see. Well, I suppose that makes a little more sense. Although, you're not from around here, are you? What brings you to town?”

“No sir, my car broke down and is in the shop here. Should be fixed sometime next week but I'm leaving on the bus in the morning.”

“Okay, so where are you staying tonight?” He asked.

I shrugged, “Honestly, I haven't quite figured that out yet.""

He studied me for a moment, “Well we have a fine motel in town, and if needs be we have a cell or two empty at the station. Come on by, if you can't find somewhere. It aint the Ritz but you won't be on the street.”

I smiled and nodded, “Thank you sir, I might just do that.”

He nodded back, “Tell them Sheriff Reed sent you.” And with that, he drove off, leaving me alone again, sort of alone.

“I got it.” Said Jimmy. “Old Mrs. Thompson. She runs the pharmacy, and she used to give me piano lessons when I was a kid.”

“And she's part of the cult?” I asked dubiously.

“I mean, I don't know for sure. But she was always such a hateful woman, and I did see her talking with the science teacher and greasy Bob a few times.” He shrugged, “Although everyone around here talks to everyone at some point, could be just coincidence.”

“Do we have any other options?” I asked.

He shrugged again, “Not really.”

“Okay then.” I said, “Let's go see old Mrs. Thompson, the evil pharmacist.”


Ten minutes later, we were standing in front of a large old farmhouse with a long, winding, fence lined driveway, complete with a dilapidated red barn and grain silo.

“This is the place.” Said Jimmy. “So, what's the plan?”

“Does this place look too picture perfect to you?” I asked.

“What do you mean?” 

I shook my head, “Never mind. So, what happened to Mr. Evil pharmacist?”

“Oh, he passed years ago. Poor man had a stroke while tending the field.”

“A stroke huh?” I asked. Turning to look at him halfway up the long dirt drive.

“Yeah, bless his heart.”

“I'm guessing you haven't been back here since you died?”

“No, why?”

I stopped and pointed towards the barn, “Because he's still hanging from the tree next to 
the barn.”

He looked to where I was pointing to see the late Mr. Thompson. He was in fact still there; his hands bound with the same blue nylon rope as was around his neck. His eyes bulged as they followed us up the drive. 

Jimmy’s mouth dropped open in shock, “Well that dirty rotten liar. Why would he go and doa thing like that?”

“Look again kid, most people don't bother tying their hands to kill themselves.”

He gasped, “That means...” 

I nodded.

Jimmy shook his head, “Poor Edgar. Well, that seals it, she has to be one of them.”

“I think you're right.” I said pointing to the house. 
The old woman stepped out of the front door and walked over to an old pickup; she was wearing some kind of dark cloak or robe. She started the truck, and the headlights illuminated the drive.

“Get down.” I said as I ducked behind a bush next to the fence line, then realized who I was talking to and mentally kicked myself.

 I took the kick back when Jimmy did in fact get down behind the bush next to me. The truck passed, probably going to wherever the ritual would be taking place. I briefly considered diving into the truck bed as it passed but quickly dismissed the idea. It was moving too fast, and I didn't think I was stealthy enough to get in without making a sound.

When we were sure the truck was gone, we made our way to the farmhouse. I was hoping I could find some clue as to where the ritual would be.

Jimmy stepped through the front door and waved to me through the glass; I grinned and 
flipped him off. 

“Can you see anything?” I asked.

“I don't know what to look for.” He said waving his arms. 

I sighed, “Are there any schedules or notes stuck to the fridge that say big secret cult thing at this time. Anything like that?“

""No, nothing here in the front room, which is the only room I have ever been in. Well, and the bathroom one time but I don't think we will find anything in there.”

“Damn. Okay, I’ll find a way in.”

I was hoping this was one of those country towns you hear about, where everyone is so friendly they don't even bother locking their doors. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with a locked and deadbolted front and back door. But not totally disappointed, I found one of the side windows had been left cracked open. 

I slid open the window and looked in, it was the kitchen. I climbed inside, careful not to knock over any of the dozens of dishes stacked precariously by the sink. I looked around the kitchen and dining room. Apparently there had been some big feast here, and all of the 
food was just left out.

“What the hell?”

“What is it?” Jimmy called from the front room.

“Is Mrs. Thompson a bit of a slob?”

“What? No, not at all, she's always been very tidy.”

“It looks like she had company, like a lot of company. A big dinner or something but they 
didn't clean any of it up. All the food and dishes are just left out.”

“Why would they do that?” 

“I'm not sure, unless they thought there was no need to clean up.”

“Like they weren't coming back.” Jimmy continued.

I left the disaster of a kitchen and made my way into the front room. Jimmy was staring out the window at Mr. Thompson, dangling from the tree.

“Isn't there something you can do for him?” he asked.

I shrugged, “I don't know, he most likely can't speak, and even if he could, he seems to be bound there.” 

I started searching through the papers on Mrs. Thompsons desk. Out of the corner of my 
eye, I saw Jimmys head sink low. I cleared my throat, “I'm hoping, that stopping whatever his wife is doing will be enough to set him free.” He nodded slightly, and I went back to my search.

“Anything yet?” Jimmy asked as I came back from searching the bedroom.

“No.” I grumbled as I plopped down on the couch and pulled out my cigarettes.

“Oh Mrs. Thompson hates smoking, you shouldn't...” He started then stopped when he saw the look I gave him. He nodded and smiled awkwardly, “Right, evil cult lady. Wish I could have one, really stick it to her.”

I lit my cigarette and chuckled. “How did you die anyway?” I asked.

He looked down at his feet for a moment then took a calming breath, “Well, it was a typical Tuesday night for the most part, only we weren't as busy as we usually were. My boss, Dave, told me I could take the night off early. He said he was gonna close soon anyway, 
had some work to do at the church or something. I thanked him and headed out the door. I had been home for about an hour when I realized that I forgot to clock out. I was tempted to just say “Oh well” and fix my timecard on my next shift... But I always had to be a goody two shoes, that's what my brother used to say anyway.” 

He took another deep steadying breath before continuing. “When I walked back into the office to clock out, I noticed the back door was open. I could hear voices but couldn't make them out. So, I got closer and peeredout through the open door. Dave was there, but he wasn't alone. Greasy Bob was there, and another man that I didn't know, He was an older man, with white curly hair and dirty clothes. They had him hogtied in the bed on Bobs truck. He looked up at me and moaned 
something through the duct tape covering his mouth. I don't know what it was, but his eyes pleaded for me to do something. Dave had been telling greasy Bob something about where to take the man, but he stopped at the man's moans for help. They turned around and saw me and I ran, I tried to anyway, but I wasn't quick enough.” He sighed, long and sad, “And that was the end of me.”

I breathed out a lung full of smoke, “Fuck... I'm sorry.”

He nodded and continued, “Afterward, when I figured out I was dead, I learned about the cult. Like I said, Mr. Paterson and greasy Bob would come into Cluckey’s and discuss things. And there were always rumors around town about...” He trailed off.

I looked up at him, “What?” 

“The rumors, I never thought about it until now but...”

“What rumors Jimmy?” I demanded.

He was pacing the floor, “The old chapel on the edge of town. When I was a kid the older teens at school always used to tell us stories about it being haunted, but I never really believed any of it.”

I gave him a look that said, “Really?""

He shrugged, “Well, that was before. And I still don't think its haunted, I mean maybe it is but that's not all. They used to tell stories about seeing dark hooded figures coming and going from the chapel on certain nights. Holy crap, Jonas. I think that's the ritual site.”

He smiled and put up his hand for a high five, “come on Jonas, let’s go stop a cult!”

I grinned and got up, putting my cigarette out on the couch and slapping his hand, “Lets 
fucking go.”

We left the Thompson house and headed for the old chapel. I checked my watch, 9:40PM. “Still a couple hours till midnight.” I thought to myself. I had no idea if midnight mattered but it seemed like the time to do culty ritual shit to me.

It took about 25 minutes to walk across town to the old chapel, even at a brisk pace. We were about 100 yards away from the chapel when Jimmy came to a dead stop.

“What are you doing?” I asked turning back to face him. 

“I can't go any farther.” he said demonstrating by walking forward and not actually moving. “Other kids would go to the chapel on dares, but this is as far as I ever made it.”

“God dammit.” I muttered, “Okay. Well, I guess I’ll go see what I can do. You stay here and keep a watch out.”

“For what?” He asked.

“I don't know, just yell if you see anything.” 

“What are you going to do?” 

I shrugged, “I’ll figure something out.” 

I crouched down in the tall grass by the road and crept up to the big creepy old building. “What the fuck am I doing?” I kept asking myself.

The old chapel was, old to say the least. It had once been painted white but was now almost all bare wood, only a few chips of paint still clung to the weathered boards here and there. The windows looked like they had all been broken and boarded up, and a faint 
orange light poured out from between the boards. The steeple stood tall but warped at an odd angle, and the large cross that stood up on it was partially broken off, making it resemble a capital T.

I could hear hushed voices inside, chanting low andominously. I crept up to a window and tried to see inside but my view was blocked by old pews shoved against the sides. Throughthe boards, I could see the ceiling of the chapel, there was a large hole in the roof. If I could get up there, I could get a better view of what was happening. 

I crept my way around to the back of the building and found the old Mrs. Thompson'spickup. Luckily it had been parked right up next to the building. I climbed on top of the truck's cab as quietly as I could, then scrambled my way onto the roof, a little less quietly. 
The roof boards creaked under my weight, and I held my breath, hoping no one had noticed. 

When there was no sign of anyone coming to see what the noise was, I made my way further up the roof, crawling on my belly. When I reached the edge of the hole, I peered down to see a dozen people. Most of them were dressed in dark robes with hoods up. They walked in a circle around a large pentagram drawn on the floor. Another man stood at the alter holding a large leatherbound book. He wore a white robe and hood. 

I leaned out to see better and the boards began to 
creak more. Suddenly they gave way, and I fell down into the midst of them in a heap of rubble, luckily some poor bastard broke my fall. The assembled cultists jumped back at my sudden arrival, then one by one, they all 
gathered round to look down at me.

“So, I guess this isn't AA?” I said between coughs.

“You!” Said the man in white, who I guessed was the leader. 

He removed his hood and glared at me; it was Sheriff Reed. 

“Evening again, officer. I think I'll take that cell now.” I said as I climbed to my feet.

“The son of a bitch killed Bob.” Said one of the cultists behind me.

“What the hell are you doing here?” 

“I was gonna ask you the same thing?” I said, “But I think I already know.”

He squinted at me, “Whatever you think you know, you're wrong.”

“So, you're not trying to open a doorway to hell and let out a whole bunch of nasty shit? Pretty much fucking up the whole world.”

The cultists around me started muttering to each other.

“We are doing the world a favor. I know you can't see that, but you will.” He said as a smile spread on his face. “You will soon see firsthand. Since you robbed us of one of our number, your blood will have to do.”

I looked back to see the cultist I had landed on; his neck twisted at an unforgiving angle. “Oops.""

“Hold him.” Said the sheriff.

I looked around and recognized one of the hoodedfigures approaching me.

“Hey Mrs. Thompson. Edgar says hello, or at least he would if the rope hadn't crushed his throat.”

She stumbled back in surprise, “What? How...” 

But I didn't wait for her to finish. My foot shot out, connecting with the nutsack of the man in front of me. He crumpled to the ground as I pivoted and threw a punch at the next cultist, their nose crunched audibly and blood splattered Mrs. Thompson. Unfortunately, that was about all the damage I managed to do. I tried to fight but there were too many. suddenly, something hard impacted the back of my head and the last thought that ran through my head as my vision went dark was, “Well, shit. This is how I die.”

I came to some time later. My hands cuffed around a pillar at the back of the chapel. The cultists were chanting something in some language I couldn't understand, maybe Latin? I wasn't sure. I could feel blood, sticky on the side of my face. I tried to move but the cuffs would let me get far.

“You’re awake.” said the sheriff. “Just in time.”

I stood, as well as I could, “In time for what? To watch you end theworld?”

“To watch us save it. And you, whoever you are, get to be a part of it. Though you don'tdeserve it.”

The sheriff went back to his place behind the alter and raised his hands addressing the assembly. “My friends. Tonight is the long-awaited night. You have all worked so hard to get us to this point and I am so very grateful to you all.” 

The cultists gave polite cheers and applauded.

“This world is sick my friends, and it will only get sicker. We must stop it. We must bring about the great cleanse.”

They applauded louder.

“Just as God cleansed the earth with the great flood, we must now bring upon it the power of the cleansing flame! Only then will the world know true peace and righteousness again!""
The cultists shouted with joy.

“The hour approaches, bring out the sacrifice!”

The cultist came and uncuffed me from the pillar, I tried to get away but it was no use. They drug me to the center of the pentagram. Sheriff Reed approached me, the book and a knife in his hands.

“You must have really bad luck son. You see, Bob there had volunteered to be the sacrifice. But since you decided to drop in and break his damn neck, looks like you’re it.”

I squirmed in the cultists grip, “How do you even know this will work? Don't I have to be willing or something?”

Someone punched me in the gut, causing me to gasp for air. As he approached, he pricked his finger with the knife. My shirt was ripped open and began drawing something on my chest.

“Doesn't say anything about willing, only that the sacrifice be marked with the sigil. Which now, you are.”

The sheriff opened the book and began reading a passage. The language he spoke, it made 
no sense, it hurt my head to hear. My vision blurred and cleared then blurred again. I thought I would pass out, then I saw it. 

Through the hole in the ceiling of the chapel, stood 
a huge, emaciated figure. Towering high and blocking out the night sky, its flesh the color of ash. Two massive wings spread out, flexing and stretching, eager to take flight. There were charred and broken skeletons dangling from the thing's coal black antlers. Its face was like that of a jackal and its eyes were deep set and burning with a fire so hot I could feel the heat from them. As it looked down at me, I saw visions of scorched cities and towns, the oceans boiled and the whole world burned. I knew that there would be no peace on earth, there would be nothing left but ash and ruin if this thing got out. I could not let that happen.

I looked back at Sheriff Reed just in time to see him plunging the knife straight at my heart. I had no other choice. I did something I absolutely hated. Something I had only done once before. I clenched every muscle in my body, and I shifted myself out of the living plane.
Every cell in my body screamed out in agonizing pain. It felt like dying, which I guess it kind of was. I could only hold it for a few seconds, but it was enough. The knife passed through me and into the chest of the cultist behind me. I shifted back and fell to the floor, looking 
back at the cultist with the blade buried in his chest. 

Everyone gasped, the sheriff started to say something but was cut off by the cultists blood curdling scream. His body began to stretch and expand as skin ripped, and bonessnapped. Suddenly his eyes caught fire, and his body exploded. Showering everyone with chunks of gore. Just as quickly, the cultist who had been next to him began screaming as his eyes caught fire. I jumped to me feet and ran for the door. I heard the wet pop as the next one exploded and the screaming continued. I shoved through the door and slammed it closed behind me. Maybe I'm an asshole for barring the door shut with them inside. But I did it anyway. 

One by one the screaming stopped, accompanied by the sound of 9 more people exploding from the inside out. Then came a great deep howling roar that seemed to shake the earth, car alarms went off, dogs and coyotes howled in the distance. The tone was so low, I felt 
like my eardrums would burst. There was the sound of strong winds like a hurricane, heat radiated from the edges of the chapel door. Then all at once the roaring and wind sound faded away into nothing.

After a few minutes, when I was pretty sure it was all over, I opened the door and stepped inside. The blood and gore that had to have covered the place was burnt to ash, but the robes lay there still, empty and smoldering but whole. I walked across the floor to what stood at the center of the ash covered room. The book, it completely unharmed. I bent down to pick it up and read the inscription on the cover, Liber Vitae, Mortis et Ultra.

“Whatever that means.” I thought. No clue how those yokels got ahold of something like this, but I figured I had better hang on to it. Wouldn't want it to fall into the wrong hands,again.

Jimmy was standing there waiting for me as I approached, “Jonas! Are you alright? What 
happened? And what was that thing standing over the chapel? “And why are you covered in blood? Eww”

I laughed and patted him on the shoulder, “Let's get out of here, I'll tell you on the way.”

On the way back into town we stopped by a pond where I rinsed the blood off of my shirt and out of my hair, didn't need anyone asking complicated questions. Jimmy was doing enough of that already. I told him what had happened and how I stopped the cult through 
sheer stupid luck. 

“You mean you went ghost mode?” he asked, grinning like a kid.

I shook my head, “First off, that's fucking stupid and I'm not calling it that. Second, I really don't know what it is or how I do it. It just seems to be something I can do, though it hurts like hell and I never want to do it again.”

A firetruck passed as we walked back up the street towards the bus stop, it looked like it was headed for Mrs. Thompsons place.

We sat together on a bench next to the bus station and talked for a while. Jimmy told me stories about his life growing up in the small town, we laughed and joked together. I wondered to myself what was still keeping him here, I had assumed that once this was 
over, he could move on. 

It turned out I had been unconscious for longer than I first thought. My watch and phone 
had broken at some point, so I had no clue what time it actually was. As we sat there 
talking like two old friends, I could see the first rays of the sun peaking over the treetops.

Jimmy stopped halfway through a story; his eyes focused on a man a few blocks away. The man was maybe in his mid 50s, with thinning gray hair and a thick mustache. The man stopped to unlock the front door of a hardware store. I looked back to Jimmy and saw barely contained tears in his eyes.

“Your dad?” I asked.

He nodded, “We had a fight, just before I...” 

Now I understood.

“I told him I hated him, that I couldn't wait to get away from him. But, I didn't mean any of it, 
I was just angry.”

“What was the fight about?” I asked.

Jimmy shrugged, “I can't even remember, we fought so much about anything and everything, we were just so different. I’d give anything to take it all back.”

I nodded and got up.

“What are you doing?”

I didn't answer, just kept on walking. I stepped through the doors of the hardware store the man had entered and saw him behind the counter a thermos of coffee in one hand and a newspaper in the other. 

“Excuse me, sir.” I said stepping up and clearing my throat.

He smiled, “Early bird huh? What can I help you with today?”

“Um, you don't know me, and this is gonna sound a little strange, but I knew your son, Jimmy.”

He blinked and looked me over, “Okay.”

“I just wanted to tell you that he was a good friend. He had a great heart, and he spoke very fondly of you.”

The smiled sadly, “You must not have known him too well. We didn't really get along, especially near the end.” 

“Everyone has rough patches, that's part of life. He loved you; he may not have shown it at the time. But he always loved you.”

There were tears in the man's eyes, but he held them back as he nodded again. “Well, thank you, young man. I really needed to hear that.”

Jimmy was standing outside, waiting for me. “Thank you, Jonas. Thank you for that.” He sniffed.

I just shrugged and looked at the rising sun, “Morning already, I'm starving.” 

“Oh hey, you still have the coupon.” He said.

I dug around in my pocket and pulled out the receipt, crumpled and with a drop of blood on one corner but still readable. I smiled.

“One small soda please, and my free regular fries.” I said, placing the coupon down on the counter.

The cashier took it and looked it over, before hissing through his teeth, “Ooh sorry sir, this coupon is only good if you purchase a Cluckey combo.”

I sighed, “Really?”

He nodded and slid the coupon back across the counter to me, “I'm afraid so.”

“So, I have to buy a combo with fries to get the free fries?”

“That is correct sir.”

I shook my head and laughed.

“Would you still like the small soda?” He asked.

I stepped out of Captain Cluckey’s, small soda in hand. “Yo Jimmy, youre not gonna believe this.”
...

“Jimmy?” I said again
...

I glanced around for him, but I already knew. I smiled and chuckled to myself, as I pulled out my last cigarette and headed for the bus station.

I run into a maintenance guy alot in my complex. He’s maybe 35 and I’m 27. He whistles at me when he sees me, a lot. Knows I have a boyfriend. And has done some strange things that I don’t want to type here only with the small chance he will see it.

I run into him ALL the time. I’m talking bare minimum 5x a week. I work from home so I’ll take my trash out, go grab a coffee, or take a walk so I run into him in the hallways easily. 

He’s super nice, and I’ll ignore the whistling and just say “how’s it going?”, we will talk for a bit, nothing weird really, he’s just asking me basic questions , but I can’t help but feel like he might make an advance.. 

Is his behavior innocent? It really upset my boyfriend when I told him that he whistles at me, this has been going on for over a year, and ends his sentences with “love” and “beautiful”. My boyfriend wants to address him directly. I don’t want him to do it only because I run into him all the time and he’s also the assigned maintenance man for our apartment. He could just be a flirt and nothing more, just wondering how to navigate it.

He also doesn’t want to enter my apartment for maintenance things when I’m not home or I’m in meetings - which makes me feel strange. He’s told me this directly. To my understanding as long as I consent to him entering while I’m not there they can do it, so the creation of a rule to me is what makes me feel a little off.

Should I address it myself or just keep blowing it off? Like I said he’s very nice, but I feel a little strange about his comfort level towards me. Is he just being nice?",1,1750793457.0,Apartmentliving,6,0.67,False

I really don't drink coffee, but lately I've been feeling sleepy since I always sleep in the morning. I love watching movies and doing laundry at night. I'm a night owl. So, for me to function well at my job, I have to drink coffee even if I don't really like it. My mom doesn't like it either since I have a chronic illness and she said it's not good for me, but I have no choice because I'm really sleepy. Then, while I was trying to take a nap last night during my 20-minute break, Mama kept nagging. At first, it was fine; I'm used to her nagging, but I was hurt when she said I was faithless, which is why I haven't been able to go abroad even after applying many times. She said her churchmates' children always ask for the Lord's guidance and even ask the pastor to pray for them. Tanggap ko naman na I'm going to hell na talaga, but her saying that I didn't get my dream job because I don't believe in God didn't sit well with me. I just got rejected last month and I spent a lot on it; she knew about it and how I feel. I didn't ask her for a penny; I borrowed from my father, but I paid him back, actually paid him the other day. I used all my own money. I did everything myself. Besides, I just want to go abroad for her, too, because I want her to live the best life. I am the breadwinner.

I was working and crying at the same time. She kept on telling me binibilang ko na mga nabigay ko sa kanya pero hindi naman talaga, I was just telling her na kung hindi dahil sa trabaho ko wala kaming mga meron kami ngayon. Sabi pa niya sakin last month na okay lang di ako natuloy sa pag abroad kasi may plan daw ang lord para sakin tapos ngayon naman iba na naman narrative nya bat di ako natuloy. Kahapon lang binigyan ko pa siya ng pang salon niya since I received a payment from my side hustle. Ive been working non-stop to buy her food and everything na kinicrave nya. I don't earn much but im always doing my best to provide her everything. I am not a good daughter, but i was never a problem to my parents. I became independent at an early age. Never akong naging sakit ng ulo nila. Inuna ko pag aaral ko kasi alam kong we're poor. I have no savings kasi sila inuna ko. Last year lang umalis sa puder ko mga pamangkin ko pero gusto nya may savings na agad ko. They don't know that I'm borrowing money to pay for all of our family's expenses because I don't want them to feel that we can't afford even simple things.

She expects the same from me with all her creative ventures. 
I’ve always been interested in creative subjects and I know a lot of people that work creative jobs. I know how much time and effort goes into starting out as an amateur artist and growing into a professional. You have to be very lucky and sometimes you have to keep a job on the side for multiple years if not forever. 
My mom is always talking about quitting her job and opening a store selling home made soap or quilts, home made cakes and coffee. She changed every what she wants to sell because she changes her hobby every year to. I am personally of the opinion that if your going to deliver a service or product that you have to do if well first and grow your skill a bit. So when she starts talking to me about buying a big sowing machine at the price of €5000 or buying a coffee business, I always ask her if she knows what she is getting herself into. It takes a lot of time keeping a business running and she’s not really particularly good in any of the creative things she does because she’s never done anything longer than a year. She always tells me that I should be more supportive of her and that she knows how to use money. I know that I’m pretty naggy but I also feel like I should be honest about my feelings.

*\[Sunday, March 25th, 5173. A small coffee shop overlooking the ocean\]*

I sighed softly in relief. I wasn't sure what was in the message she just got, or who sent it, but it seemed to soften her demeanor some. I was still trying to figure out why my hand was trembling, and just how to stop it. For the time being, I kept my hands clasped together in my lap. I looked around, taking in the crowd of people shuffling by, seeing the ever-present Ironclad security force on their patrols, and hearing the inane chatter of the people. There was an *itch* between my shoulders I couldn't quite scratch—instinctive, not physical.

I did my best to shrug it off and focus on the conversation I was having with Angela. ""Well... It's not much to tell, but I think that if our lives could be lost so quickly, that it only serves to reason that we try to *enjoy* it more, you know?"" I squirmed a bit in my seat, an odd feeling building in my chest.

Angela nodded. ""I think that's a *fantastic* thing, Ozzy. We absolutely *should* enjoy our lives more. We were luckier than most of the rest of the people. If memory serves me, I think only *one* person survived besides us, and we weren't listed in the roster as having attended that day for some reason.""

I cast a quick glance to my left, seeing the same Ironclad Sentinel that had been there for forty-five minutes. Why was he staring at us? ""Yeah, but I think she died on Friday. Even after LibertyForge and Vanguard spent hundreds of millions in an attempt to save her.""

*Ozzy? Are you okay? Your stress levels are rising.*

*{The Sentinel to our left has been staring at us for forty-five minutes! Why?}*

*That's odd. Give me a moment............. You need to leave. Both of you.*

*{What? Why?}*

*Make up any excuse and leave. Now, please. And quietly.*

Angela sipped her coffee, a thoughtful expression on her face. ""I'd heard that. Pretty sad that she did.""

I leaned toward her and softly spoke, ""Um... I'm not feeling too great out here around all these people, Angela. I keep thinking *something* will happen again. Is there somewhere else we could go?""

She leaned in, her face radiating worry. ""What's wrong, Ozzy? I mean, yes. My home is just a short train ride from here. Would that be okay?""

I nodded and moved to stand. ""Yes. I-I'm sorry, Angela.""

She snorted and waved her hand, then punched something into her phone. ""Don't you dare. It's absolutely okay, and to be honest, I was feeling a little antsy, myself. Shall we?"" She stood and gestured toward the train.

I nodded and walked beside her, beginning to feel somewhat better. With her nearly a foot shorter than me, I had to adjust my stride to keep pace.

*There is a crowd of people coming up behind you. Try to get in the middle of them, and stay with them.*

*{Okay. I don't understand, but please tell me when you think we're safe from whatever it is you've found.}*

*Absolutely.*

True to Nova's word, a crowd swept up from behind, moving a *little* faster than us, and I put an arm around Angela's shoulders, keeping her close as we matched their pace. I heard a soft intake of breath when I did it, but reasoned that she would have pushed me away had I crossed a line. Instead, she seemed to *lean in* a little bit. I didn't know what it meant, but as long as we were both moving, I didn't care. A few moments later, and part of the group split off and went down a street while the rest of us continued to the train station. I followed the periodic commands from Nova, managing to keep us roughly in the middle of everyone until we got to the busy station.

Angela tugged me toward a sign, and pulled my head down to make sure she was heard. ""Looks like we have a five minute wait. Will you be okay? There's a *lot* more people here, Ozzy.""

I looked around slowly, not seeing any Sentinels nearby. ""I *think* so? That weird feeling I was having is gone, at least.""

""Good."" She patted my arm. She looked up at me with a smile. ""That was *nice*.""

I cocked my head. ""Huh? What was?""

A soft laugh bubbled up from her. ""The way you put your arm around me. It felt...*nice*. Like you were there to keep things from happening.""

""I mean... Kinda?"" I ran my good hand through my hair. ""I didn't want anything to happen to *either* of us, so... yeah.""

*I have performed a full scan of your surroundings. There are no Sentinels or drones in quite a distance. You are safe.*

*{Thanks, Nova. Why did we leave like that, though?}*

*Because that Sentinel was watching you two, and* ***only*** *you two. When you left, he followed at a distance that* ***most*** *AI assistants cannot detect. My sensor package appears to be different than most, and I could easily track him. You lost him when the group split.*

*{Oh shit. Anything else? Any idea why?}*

*I have a theory, and you won't like it. Neither of you will, and yes, you will need to tell Angela.*

*{Let's wait until we get to her house.}*

We stood there, near the front of the platform, Angela pressed to my side and my arm over her shoulders, looking for all the world like the most awkward couple ever. I was too *terrified* to move, and she seemed lost in a daydream. A couple of minutes later, the train sped into the station and stopped. The doors on the opposite side opened and hundreds of people exited, chattering away. The entry doors opened and we all boarded, taking a seat or standing, as we felt necessary. Angela and I took a pair of seats next to the door, and a few minutes later, the train sped off at a blistering two hundred miles per hour.

We sat quietly, watching the scenery fly by, hearing hushed conversations from other passengers and I finally felt a bit safer. Still a touch anxious, as I had no idea what Nova was going to drop on us in a few minutes.

Three stops later, Angela patted my hand, snapping me from my daydreams. She stood, and I rose with her. Slowly the train came to a stop, and we left through the exit doors. She silently led the way to her house, and I followed, feeling a little comforted that Nova hadn't alerted me to anything *new*. A few minutes later, and Angela had closed the front door behind us.

""Welcome to my home, Ozzy. If I'd even *thought* I'd be bringing you back here, I'd have cleaned a bit better. Are you feeling better? Can I get you something to drink?""

I shook my head and felt a rumbling from deep inside me. ""No thank you. Um... Where is the bathroom?""

""Ah. Coffee. Right. It's down the hall to your left.""

I went to the bathroom, surprised by the sudden urgency. When I returned, Angela had seated herself on the couch, a couple of glasses of water on the small table. ""Sorry.""

""No, you're fine. I should have warned you. Coffee also helps you *go*. There's no predictability to it, but it's there. Please, sit.""

I sat on the end of the couch, away from her, leaning my elbows on my knees. I was about to open my mouth, when I heard Nova's voice come through the speakers in the house.

*Hello, Angela. I am Nova, Ozzy's Assistant.*

Startled, we both looked around.

""Nova? How did you get in her system?""

*I'll explain in a moment. Suffice to say, it was trivial. There has been a...development. Ozzy, that so-called itch you were feeling? You two were being watched by one of the Sentinels. Unfortunately, I have itentified him as having been at the church when it was attacked.*

""What? How is that possible? Ozzy and I are the *only* other survivors.""

""She's right, Nova. The other survivor died on Friday.""

There was a momentary pause. *I didn't say he was a survivor.*

My eyes went wide, and I looked over at Angela. Her mouth was open.

*You understand, then. Good. Yes, I believe that ten members of the Sentinels executed the attack on the church that maimed you, Ozzy, and wounded you terribly, Angela. I have positively identified the man thanks to a tattoo on his hand. It was* **not** *an act of the Nullborn.*

I sat back on the couch. Ironclad did this? Why? What was the use? ""But... *why*? What purpose could there be in attacking the church? We were *harmless*!""

*I do not have sufficient data to answer that question. Angela, you should know that you are now* **both** *likely to be under tighter scrutiny for quite some time. I would suggest continuing as you have been. Pay your bills, work your shifts, and above all else -* ***do nothing suspicious.***

I sighed. This was getting real old, real quick. Angela spoke before I could.

""How do you know all this, Nova? How did you break into my home security?""

*I simply asked your AI. Cosmo was quick to let me in.*

""Cosmo? Is this true?""

A second voice answered. It's tone was *markedly* different from Nova's. ""*Yes, ma'am. Nova is a class III-C AI. I am simply a class II-A. I must follow its commands. It has forbidden me from reporting this incident to AetherNet. I have been sending the usual callback pings, so that nothing is seen as amiss. Is this to your liking, Ma'am?*""

""Uh... Sure, Cosmo. That's fine."" Angela looked at me, and I could see the fear there.

I sighed. ""Nova, is this location secure? Are you positive none of this conversation will get to Aether?""

*Yes, Ozzy. Nothing said here will leave this location.*

I shifted on the couch, facing Angela, who had a throw pillow pressed against her middle. ""There's something you should know..."" And I told her *everything*. From getting the HoloFrames, to having them ""upgraded"", even that the Nullborn lived among us, quietly going about their lives, trading tech for favors and information, though I refused to tell her who it was that I knew among them.

""...and here we are. You wanted to know what hope I found? It's *them*, Angela. The Nullborn. And I'm going to help them however I can. You can either turn me in or not; it really doesn't matter at this point. The system is going to come for us, *regardless*. Once that Sentinel relays what he's seen to headquarters, our days are most likely numbered.""

*There* ***is*** *another possibility, Ozzy. His superiors may simply remove* ***him****. I would bet that his orders were to eliminate the entirety of the churchgoers. Failures are not taken lightly at Ironclad. Either that, or they will do nothing. Neither of you exhibited any outward suspicion, so he might also say nothing, knowing the potential consequences. I still recommend caution, however. If, after a couple of months, nothing happens, I would say you are in the clear.*

I nodded along with Nova's explanation. Made sense, after all. ""Think you can do that, Angela?""

Angela shook her head, clearing the cobwebs in her mind. "" Yeah. Be boring for a couple months. Sure. No problem.""

""You okay?""

""I'm just trying to take it all in, Ozzy. It's a crazy story, to be sure. I didn't even know class III-C AI *existed*.""

""Yeah... sometimes even *I* can't believe all this. But I'm here. *Living it*. I even have access to *music*, now.""

Angela's face brightened. ""*Music*? I've not heard it since I was a little girl.""

*Shall I play the same piece that was your first, Ozzy?*

I smiled, knowing what was coming. ""Yeah. I think that's a good idea, Nova. Just make sure nobody else can hear it.""

The NCLEX, a formidable gatekeeper, loomed large in my mind. Months turned into a blur of dedicated study, late-night reviews, and countless practice questions. Each correct answer fueled a flicker of hope, a step closer to the dream of practicing nursing in the United States. The day I saw ""PASS"" illuminated on the screen was a moment of pure, unadulterated joy, a validation of every sacrifice and late-night hour. It wasn't just a test result; it was the key that unlocked the first door to a new chapter, a testament to resilience and unwavering determination.

With the NCLEX hurdle cleared, the next phase of the journey unfolded: the complex world of immigration. Securing an employer sponsor felt like navigating a labyrinth, filled with paperwork, interviews, and the anxious wait for approvals. I vividly remember the day I received the job offer, a chance to work in a bustling hospital in a vibrant American city. This was followed by the meticulous process of filing the I-140 petition, each document a piece of my future being carefully assembled. The priority date became a constant companion, its slow movement on the visa bulletin a source of both frustration and anticipation. The waiting taught me patience, a quality essential for both nursing and the immigration process.

Finally, the email arrived – an invitation for my immigrant visa interview. The culmination of years of hard work, financial investment, and emotional fortitude, it was a moment charged with both excitement and trepidation. Stepping onto American soil with my newly granted Green Card felt surreal, a profound sense of accomplishment washing over me. From the rigorous demands of the NCLEX to the intricate dance of immigration paperwork, my journey as an international nurse was a testament to perseverance. It was more than just obtaining a license or a card; it was the realization of a lifelong ambition, a new beginning in a country that now felt like home.",7,1750793074.0,NCLEXsuccessStories,10,1.0,False

I’ve been tinkering with ChatGPT for a few months and I’m convinced we’re only scratching the surface in our space. Here’s how I’m using it so far:

* **Rate & lane analysis for big RFPs:** I drop in DAT, GreenScreens, and internal data, then have the bot flag outliers, blend averages, and spot margin opportunities.
* **Oversize/OD route checker:** One prompt + ZIPs + dims + weight → which states need permits, escorts, curfews, etc. Huge time-saver.
* **Daily market brief:** A scheduled 7 AM summary of capacity shifts, diesel prices, tender rejections—perfect five-minute coffee read.

I know AI can do a lot more—billing audits, carrier scorecards, appointment setting, you name it—so I’m looking to learn from the hive mind.

1. What repeat tasks have you automated with a chatbot or other AI tool?
2. Any “aha” prompts, plug-ins, or workflows you’d be willing to share?

My mother, sister, and brother stood in the cold beside the new earth and I stood with them. We did not look at each other. We looked at the hole.

My father, who had been the warrant for our lives was in that hole, and we were what was left. Four shapeless things set to motion by some old and forgotten custom because the man who gave us shape was in the ground and whatever part of us that knew the right way to stand or breathe was down there with him.

The ride from that place was quiet. My mother (Eleanor) sat beside me and her hands were knotted one on top of the other in her lap. In the back my sister (Clara) had listed against my brothers shoulder (Thomas.) He stared out at the passing dark with the stone face of a boy playing at manhood and I could feel his gaze on the back of my neck from time to time.

We arrived home. The air was choked with the baked meats and pale casseroles of the neighbors, a sick kind of charity that no one would touch.

A woman from next door was speaking. Mrs. Gable. “Eleanor you must eat something. You will need your strength.”

My mother smiled. “Thank you Carol. You are too kind.”

I could not stand the sound of their whispers nor the weight of their pity. 

They looked at us like we were relics of a sudden and common tragedy. 

I would not be one of them. 

I had to leave.

“Mother,” I said. “I’m going to take a drive, just to… clear my head”

She turned her dark eyes on me. They were old eyes. “Leo perhaps it is best you stay. The hour is late.”

“I wont be long,” I said. “I just need some air.”

Clara looked up. “Well, don’t go too far Leo.”

“I wont.” I put my hand to Thomas’s shoulder as I passed.

I woke the engine and pulled the car from the curb and left behind the house with its false piety and its wilting flowers. I had no destination. I just drove. I pushed the car out onto the blacktop and the tires screamed on the turns. 

The houses fell away to fields and then the fields gave themselves over to the woods, a dense and unbroken wall that ran along the old state road. Here I thought I would find a silence I could stand. For some miles I did. Only the engine and the wind that tore through the open window.

The sun was going down in the west and it bled across the sky in violent hues of orange and deep purple. Its beauty was an offense and a blasphemy. The world had no right to such colors when my father could not see them. I pushed my foot to the floor.

And then the engine choked. It coughed once and then again. The steady hum of the motor tore itself into a rattling gasp. The car shuddered and bucked and I wrestled the wheel and guided its dying weight to the gravel shoulder just as the engine quit altogether.

I tried the crank. 

It gave a lone dry click and then nothing. 

I sat there for a long time with my hands gripping the wheel. 

The colors bled out of the sky and left it a bruised and draining gray. I was stranded. On a road that went nowhere, flanked by a black and serrated wall of trees. Miles from a town that was awash in my own sorrow. The last of the sun died behind the treeline and the dark seeped into everything.

And it was in that quiet that the sound came. Drifting from the absolute black of the woods. It was low and it was lonesome and it was the slow aching voice of some stringed instrument.

I believed it to be a cello though I could not say for certain. I sat in the car and listened to it and knew nothing else.

For a long space of time one part of my mind spoke reason. I would have to be a fool to walk into the woods at dusk on an empty road. Thomas would have called me so. My mother would be made sick with the worry of it. And yet, I would have to be a fool to also sit in a dead car. 

The road was empty of other travelers. There were no houses here. There was only me and there was the sound. I reasoned that it was a man and that a man might help me and I pushed open the door of the car. The music was made clearer. It was a tune of impossible sadness. It called to me.

The trees were old, and thick black pines stood like skeletons against a sky draining of its light.

""Hello?"" I said.

The cello did not stop playing. 

It only beckoned me onward into the coming dark.

I do not know how long I walked on that soft bed of pinefall but I broke through the trees and into a clearing and I stopped. The thing I saw was wrong and it was right all at once. In the center of that small glade on the trunk of a felled tree sat a man. He held a cello before him and its wood shone with a deep and secret light and he drew the bow across its belly with his head bowed to the work. He was still save for the measured slide and return of his arms. 

The clothes he wore were dark and finely cut and they had no place in such a setting. His hair was the color of a crow's wing and his face was a bloodless pale. He played out the last of the phrase and the final note hung in the air like a soul loath to leave its body and then it was gone and there was only the low hum of the forest night. 

He looked up then and his eyes found me in the gloaming. They were dark and they were deep and there was a great stillness in them as if my coming there was a thing he had been waiting on for some long time.

""Lost, little bird?"" He said.

I cleared my throat of a sudden thickness.

""My car,"" I said, and gestured with my hand back toward the road I had left. ""It broke down on the service road. I… I heard your music.""

""Ah,"" he said. A smile touched the corner of his mouth. ""It does tend to carry on the evening air. Forgive my lack of a formal concert hall."" He set the bow to rest across the strings. ""It is a dangerous thing to wander into these woods after dark.""

""I was hoping you might have some way to get a message to town,"" I said. ""Or know of a nearby house with a telephone.""

The man stood and I saw that he was tall and slender and he moved with a litheness that was not entirely natural. 

""There are no houses for miles,"" he said, and his tone was soft and I thought I heard pity in it. ""And my means of communication are rather more... esoteric. My name is Julian.""

""Leo,"" I replied.

He took a step from the log and I took a step back from him. There was a warning in the deep part of me. He saw this and he stopped and the smile did not leave his face.

""You are burdened, Leo,"" he said. And his dark eyes looked not at me but into me as if he could see the hollow ruin in my chest. ""I saw it on you the moment you stepped into my glade. You carry a heavy weight. A loss…""

The truth of his words struck me dumb. As if he had reached into my skull and pulled the thought from me.

""My father,"" I whispered. ""We just buried him this afternoon.""

""I am truly sorry,"" Julian said, and the words sounded true in a way that nothing else had. ""There is no pain like it. The world keeps turning, foolishly, maddeningly, and you are left with an amputation in your soul.""

He took another slow step toward me and this time I did not move. 

""What if I told you there was a way to soothe that pain? To quiet that part of you which knows only how to grieve?""

I blinked at him. ""What are you talking about? Nothing can do that but time.""


""Ah, but time is a crude, clumsy surgeon,"" he said. He stood now no more than an arm’s length from me and I could feel a coldness coming off him. ""It dulls the wound by piling scar upon scar, burying the fresh ache under a heap of smaller ones. But it never truly heals it. The pain remains."" He tilted his head like a curious hawk. ""I offer something more profound. A release. A gift that rewrites the very nature of suffering. It does not erase the memory, but it cauterizes the wound forever. The hurt will become a thing you observe, like a painting from your past, but no longer a blade twisting in your gut.""

His words were a dark gospel sung to the raw and weeping wound inside of me. That part of me that clawed for release was now stronger than the part that counseled fear. I only wanted the pain to be over.

""How?"" I asked.

Julian's smile widened and I saw his teeth in the twilight. They were very white. ""It is simple,"" he whispered. 

And his hand rose and came to rest upon my shoulder. The cold of it was a shock. His touch was absolute and I knew I could not move from that spot if I tried. His other hand rose and cupped my jaw and he tilted my head to the side.

""This will only sting for a moment,"" he said. ""Then, the healing begins.""

Before my mind could make sense of his meaning he leaned his head to my neck. I felt a sharp and piercing pain, a pain of two points like hot needles driven into my flesh. A gasp was torn from my throat but no cry would follow it. 

A great and sudden weakness flooded the vessel of my body and the world upended itself. The dark trees smeared into streaks of black and the last of my grief and my fear dissolved into a rushing dark. 

The last thing I saw was the darkness of his eyes as he looked down upon me. And in them I did not see malice. I saw what I took to be a terrible and profound pity.

I woke to the steering wheel pressed into my chest. A gray and cheerless light seeped through the glass of the car windows. It was dawn. And the memory of it came back to me. 

A pale face. 

The touch of a cold hand. 

A pain like two spikes driven into the flesh of my neck. 

I sat upright with a winded gasp and my own hand flew to my neck. My fingers found two small hard knots on the skin, like the bites of some strange insect, but I knew in my soul they were not.

I was in my car where I had been. The door was shut. There was no sign of the man Julian, and there were no tracks in the dirt but my own leading to the dark wall of the woods. I did not know if it had been a dream or not.

My body felt… strange to me now. The hollow ache of grief had been muted. I knew the fact of my father’s death but I did not feel the weight of it. And in place of that weight there was a high and terrible alertness. 

On pure instinct I reached for the crank and gave it a turn. The engine caught and tore itself into a living sound, a sound of greater power than I had ever known it to possess. I put the car in gear and I fled that cursed stretch of road.

The familiar streets of my town were different. The clatter of a milk wagon down a side street was like a gunshot right next to my ear. The smell of coal smoke from a chimney a block away was like a black powder in my lungs. The world came at me, an assault on the senses. It was too much.

I pulled the car to the curb before the house and I killed the engine. I stilled myself for what was to come. I saw the curtain in the window twitch and then the door was thrown open and my mother was on the porch. The black funeral dress was still on her. She had not slept.

""Leo! Oh, thank God, Leo!"" She came down the steps in a rush and her arms were around me as I stepped from the car. ""Where were you? We were beside ourselves! Thomas was just about to go looking for you with Mr. Gable!""

I held her. And through the thin black cloth of her dress I could feel the frantic beat of her heart. I could smell the life on her, the heat of her blood in the veins and the salt of her skin, and some new and ravenous thing woke in the pit of me. I pulled back from her as if from a fire.

""I'm sorry, Mother,"" I said. ""The car… it stalled on the old service road. I must have been more tired than I thought. I fell asleep waiting for someone to come by.""

She put her hand to my face and its warmth was a brand on my cold skin. ""You're pale as a sheet. And you feel so cold. You come inside this instant. I'll get some coffee on, and there’s leftover ham.""

The thought of coffee made me sick. And the image of the ham, of its pink and lifeless flesh, sent a gorge rising so powerfully that I had to clench my teeth to hold it down.

""No, Mother, please. I just… I need to lie down. The exhaustion just caught up to me, I think.""

Inside, my sister Clara was at the foot of the stairs and the worry on her face gave way to relief. And Thomas stood in the doorway to the sitting room. His arms were crossed over his chest and his eyes were hard and they questioned me. ""Where'd you go?"" he asked.

""The car broke down,"" I said again. And I pushed past him toward the stairs. ""I’m fine.""

But I was not fine. The house was full of their life, of their heat and their breath. I went to my room and I closed the door on the sound of them. I leaned my back against the wood. And a hunger I did not know clawed at my gut. It was not a hunger for any food I had ever eaten.

I stumbled to the small mirror over the washbasin. The face that looked back at me from the silvered glass was my own and it was not. The skin was tight across the bone and it held the waxy pallor of a corpse. But it was my eyes that held me. They were still blue but there was a new darkness swimming in them, a depth that had not been there before. 

And the pupils were blown wide like an animal’s. And as I stared the man in the mirror parted his lips. And my tongue, of its own volition, went to my canine teeth. And found that they were longer. That they were sharpened to a point.

A great dizziness washed over me. The memory of the man Julian. *It does not erase the memory, but it cauterizes the wound forever.* And the grief was far and distant. But in its place he had put this thing. This cold alertness. This revulsion for food. This awful and unholy hunger. He had given me his gift. And I ran my trembling fingers over the two perfect punctures that lay hidden beneath the collar of my shirt, and I knew. The cost of curing the soul’s grief was the soul itself. I was no longer Leo, a son and a brother. I was something else entirely.

The days that followed were a new kind of hell. I stayed locked inside of my bedroom with my curtains drawn tight against a sun that held a searing malevolence. The pale light that trespassed through the gaps itched and burned my skin.

My family in their grace and their ignorance respected what they took to be my exhaustion. They left trays of cooked meats and bread outside my door and the food went untouched until my mother would retrieve them hours later with a small sigh.

And the hunger grew. My own stomach was a place of disgust for the food of my mother’s house. When Clara would knock and her clear voice would pass through the door it was a torment. 

When I heard the sound of my brother Thomas in the hall, the sound of his hot thrumming life was a tremor of want that went through my whole body. 

I stayed in that room not for myself but for them. For what I had become viewed my family not with the love I knew but with a cold and terrible calculus.

""Leo, please,"" my mother said through the door on the third night. ""Let me in. Talk to me. Doctor Hanes said he could make a house call. Are you ill? Whatever it is, son, we can face it together.""

""I am fine, Mother,"" I called out to her. I was coiled on the bed, my fists clenched to whiteness. The drum of her heart through the thick oak of the door was a lure I could not long deny. ""I just need rest. I will be down in the morning.""

But on the fourth night the hunger was a tyrant and my body screamed for what it now needed. I knew if I stayed within those walls I would lose what little purchase I had and commit a horror that could never be undone. When the last of the light had gone a fever came upon me and all reason was ash. I had to be out of that house. I had to feed.

I slipped from my room and I passed through the dark house and it made no sound to mark my going. The floors that had groaned my whole life beneath my weight were now silent under my feet. I passed down the stairs like a draft of cold air. I unlatched the front door and I went out into the night.

The moon was a high cold eye in the darkness and it bathed the world in a silver light that was more true to me now than the sun had ever been.

I did not go to the woods. The nature of the thing I was knew that the herd was in the town. I stalked the edges of it and I kept to the black shadows of the alleys and the stone walls of gardens. And every sense was a fire in me, alive to the night and what it might offer.

And then I heard him. The unsteady scuff of his bootheels and a slurred and tuneless song. A man who had come from the side door of Connolly's Tavern, too deep in his cups to navigate the main road. He was a tramp I knew by sight. He stank of cheap whiskey and sour sweat and beneath it all was the rich copper scent of his blood and it was a call to the deepest part of me. I took him in the narrows of the alley behind the butcher’s shop. He was fumbling at his trousers with the slack jawed confusion of the drunkard. He saw me step from the ink black shadows and he squinted his eyes.

""Hey, what you... what you want, boy?"" he slurred.

I gave him no answer. 

There were no words for this.

I crossed the space between us in less than a second. One hand clamped to his mouth to quell his cry and the other pulled his head to the side and the vein there pulsed against the night.

The world went red.

There was the brief terror in his eyes and the panicked thrash of his limbs and then a gurgling sound as the hot iron taste of his blood flooded my mouth. And it was a benediction and a damnation in a single instant. The relief was ecstasy, an explosive charge that silenced the agony I had carried for days. The flavor was life itself. Rich and deep and true. It stilled the beast in me.

When the fever passed I fell back from him. The man slumped to the stones. His eyes were wide and they saw nothing. A small dark trickle of his blood had run down his chin and his neck was a ruin. The cobblestones were slick and black with him. I looked at my own hands. At the front of my shirt.

A great wave of revulsion crashed over the calm of the predator. And the boy named Leo was there again, staring at the work he had done. I had killed a man.

I fled into the dark, trembling with a foul mix of satiation and a loathing for myself that had no bottom. I found a horse trough blocks away and I washed myself in the cold clear water.

When I slipped back into the sleeping house the silence was no longer a refuge. It was an indictment. I was the wolf in the fold, a monster cloaked in the skin of their son and brother. The new and terrible keeper of Julian's awful and bloody gift.

""I insist.""

My mother said the words in the hall. I had crept from my room for a glass of water and she stood there waiting for me. The light from the downstairs lamps was a hostile glare that made me squint my eyes.

""We will all have dinner together tonight,"" she said. And her arms were crossed over her chest. ""At the table. As a family. The Gables sent over a fine roast, and Clara baked a loaf of bread. There will be no more of this hiding in your room Leo. Your father would not have wanted this.""

I could not argue. ""Yes, Mother. Of course.""

Her face changed. The hard lines of her resolve softened. ""Good,"" she said. ""Six o'clock. Thomas will be home from his part time stocking work then. It will be nice. We will get back to normal.""

Normal. 

The word was from a language I no longer spoke.

At some minutes to six I came down the stairs. And the smells that rose from the dining room were horrible. The rich scent of roasted meat, a smell I had once coveted, was now the perfume of cooked death. The yeast and wheat of my sister’s bread was like the smell of dry dust.

They were all there when I entered. Clara gave me a small and hopeful smile. Thomas looked at me and his usual suspicion was held in abeyance by his mother’s will. My mother sat at the head of the table near the steaming dishes and her face was lit with the brittle triumph of a woman who had wrested one small victory.

""Leo! Come, sit,"" she said, and gestured to my seat across the table from Clara. ""I will serve you a plate.""

""Thank you, Mother, but I can serve myself,"" I said. 

I placed onto my plate a slice of beef so thin it was translucent. I took a single boiled potato. A sprig of green parsley. I sat. The life that came from them, the heat of their bodies and the rhythm of their breathing and the low thump of their hearts beating just beneath the skin, all of it was an agony to me. The hunger that had been sated but two nights before stirred in the pit of me, a sleeping wolf roused by the proximity of the flock.

""It feels so good to be all together,"" Mother said. And she began to speak of the weather and of the goings-on at the parish. Clara spoke of a book. Thomas said nothing. He only watched me from over the rim of his glass of milk.

I took up my fork. I nudged the potato. Forcefully, I lifted it to my mouth. The moment its mealy substance touched my tongue my body rose in revolt. My throat closed like a noose and a hot bile climbed my gullet. I forced it down with a swallow of water.

""Clara, this bread is simply wonderful,"" Mother said. ""Leo, you must try a piece."" The basket was passed to my hands.

I took a piece and I tore a small corner from it and put it in my mouth. All I could think of was the man in the alley. All I could remember was the glorious and terrible torrent of his life.

""Is something wrong, Leo?"" Clara asked. ""You look as though you've eaten a lemon.""

I pulled my lips back from my teeth in a thing that was meant to be a smile. ""No, not at all. It's… delicious. I think perhaps my stomach has shrunk from not eating properly these past few days.""

Thomas set his fork down and the sound of the silver on the china was a sharp report that silenced the table. He was looking at me.

""You haven't swallowed a single bite, Leo,"" he said. ""I've been watching you. You just move it around the plate.""

""Thomas, that is enough,"" Mother said.

""No, it's not,"" he said. And his eyes never left my own. ""Something's wrong with you. You're always cold. You never go out during the day. Your eyes look... strange. And you haven't eaten a real meal since the day of Father's funeral. Don't lie and say you have. We can all see you haven't.""

A great silence fell over the room. The ticking of the clock in the hall was the only sound. My mother stared at my brother as if he were a stranger to her. And Clara’s gaze went between us and her bottom lip began to tremble. All of them looked at me.

A low pressure built behind my canines. 

My hands below the table had taken the napkin and were twisting it into a knot. 

I had to leave. Now.

""I don't feel well,"" I said. I pushed my chair back from the table and its legs shrieked against the polished wood of the floor. ""Thomas is right. I'm not hungry. Forgive me.""

I did not wait for their reply. I turned and fled from the light of the room and from their living faces. I took the stairs two at a time. I shut the door to my room and I locked it and I collapsed against the cool wood of it. My body trembled with the thing it held inside me. And from downstairs I could hear the sound of their voices. Muffled and urgent. My mother's reprimand. My brother's hot defense. My sister beginning to cry.

The lie was cracking.

A week passed in that house and it was a week of coldness. I became a ghost in my own house, a creature of the upper floors and the deepest hours of the night when I might slip down for a glass of water from the tap.

My brother's suspicion was a wall between us now, and my mother’s love was fear.

The hunger in me had been fed. But it was a patient beast. It was coiled and it was waiting. And a thing stronger than the hunger rose in me now, a need that drove me from the house. A need for answers.

What was I? 

And what were the laws of this new and cursed earth I walked upon?

There was only one who knew.

That night, when the house had fallen into a sleep that was not restful, I went out from it. The car answered the crank. It did not fail me now. I drove the miles of dark road back to the place where everything had changed. I parked the car on the patch of earth where the man I was had died. I went to the wall of the woods. The path to the glade was not a memory in my mind but now a new instinct in my blood.

""Julian!"" I called to the darkness. ""I know you are here. Show yourself!""

There was no sound. I stepped into the trees. The branches that reached for me I broke with a strength I had not owned before.

""There is no point in hiding! You did this to me. The least you can do is explain!""

""Such impatience,"" a voice said. It came from directly behind me. I turned and he was there. Julian, leaning against the great trunk of an oak. ""Patience is a virtue of eternity, Leo. You must learn it.""

I did not have the time for his philosophy. 

""What did you do to me?"" I said. ""What am I?""

He pushed himself from the tree and walked toward me through the gloom. ""Is it not obvious?"" he said. ""I gave you the gift I promised. I have made you like me. Immortal. Strong. Keen of sense. You are untethered from the sluggish, inevitable decay of your kind. We are predators at the apex of the world, beings of the night."" He paused. ""Or rather, you are a confused fledgling who blundered through his first feed like a clumsy animal. I heard of your work in town. Very… enthusiastic."" 

A cold shame washed through me. ""He was a person,"" I said. 

""He was sustenance,"" Julian corrected. ""Cattle have names, too, I'm sure. You mustn't get attached. Sentimentality is the anchor that drowns our kind. It roots you in a world you are no longer a part of.""

""My family… I cannot eat. The smell of their food makes me sick. And when I'm near them… I feel...""

""The hunger,"" he said, and he nodded as a scholar does at a simple axiom. ""Yes. Their beating hearts. The sound is louder to a newborn like yourself. It takes a discipline you do not yet possess to live beside them without seeing a meal. It is a skill, I confess, that I myself have found little use for.""

""But this, this is not a life,"" I said. ""I am a prisoner in my own home. The sun…""

The amusement left his face. ""Ah, yes. The great Tyrant Sun,"" he said. ""That is the one true law. The price for what we are. You are right to hide from it. Direct sunlight is death, Leo. A swift and ravenous death. Avoid it as you would the very eye of God.""

“So that’s it? I'm condemned to the shadows forever? To hide from them, and starve for…""

""For blood,"" Julian said. ""Say the word. You must accept what you are. That is the only path. You crave the essence of life. Red blood. Human blood. Your life is measured now from hunt to hunt."" He stepped closer and the unnatural cold of him washed over me. ""I chose you, Leo, for the great darkness I saw in your grief. I thought to grant you a life where such pain had no purchase.""

""You did not cure my pain, you made it eternal!"" I said to him. ""I will lose them all, my mother, my sister, my brother, and I will still be here when they are dust. Your gift is a curse.""

A strange and knowing sadness touched his lips. ""Perhaps,"" he said. ""Or perhaps you have not lived long enough in its shadow. A century from now, when their faces are but a painless echo, you will see the mercy I have given you."" His words were the words of a madman. ""Now, go home, fledgling. Learn control. Your family is your first and greatest trial. Live beside them. And we shall see if you are a shepherd or only a wolf. The choice, as they say, is yours.""

He turned then. And he did not walk into the woods but was consumed by them, the deep shadows pulling him back into themselves until he was gone. I stood alone in the moonlight. I was chilled not by the air of the night but by the terrible and lucid knowledge of what I had become. He had given me the laws of my new life, and a challenge. To control the beast. Or be devoured by it from within.

And so I went out into the night to do the work that must be done. I took to the lonely roads between our town and the next. The drunks and the tramps of my own streets I left to their miserable sleep. Their disappearances were too close to home. instead, my hunts were for men who traveled alone, for farmhands returning late from a distant field. Julian's cold catechism was my guide. I learned to be a clean and silent predator. The bodies I gave to the deep woods and the earth took them without comment.

But my brother was not a man for illusions. He had our father's eyes and our father's unwillingness to abide a lie. The sickness I had claimed as my shield had grown thin with the passing weeks. He watched me. And he knew the man I had been, and he saw the wrongness of the thing I had become.

He chose his time. One night when I was coming from my room to go out upon my hunt. To take a drive, I called it. Mother and Clara were abed. He was waiting at the foot of the stairs. A shadow standing in the greater shadow of the hall with his arms crossed over his chest. He barred my way.

""Out for another drive, Leo,"" he said.

""Yeah, the night air helps clear my head,"" I said. And I made to step around him.

He did not move. His eyes, so like our father’s eyes, held mine. ""I do not believe you,"" he said. ""Mother chooses to believe. And Clara is too afraid not to. But I do not. I have been watching you. Since that night.""

""Nothing has changed,"" I said.

""Everything has,"" he said. And he took a step toward me. The living heat of him rolled off his body in waves and the coiled thing in me stirred. ""You are stronger. I saw you move that heavy crate of Father's old books in the attic last week like it was nothing. I remember it took both of us to get it up there. And you’re colder. Mother touched your arm this morning, and she said it was like touching marble."" His voice went lower. ""What happened on that road, Leo? What was done to you?""

I tried to keep my voice flat. ""You are letting your imagination get the best of you. I am only grieving.""

""This is not grief,"" he said, and he shook his head slowly. ""Grief makes you weak. It makes you cry. It makes you need people. You... you are the opposite of that. You avoid the daylight. Where do you go every night? Tell me the truth, Leo.”

""There is nothing to tell,"" I said. ""I am handling my grief in my own way. And I would appreciate it if you would stop keeping watch on me like I am a criminal and let me live in peace.""

He stood there. ""You are not him,"" he whispered. His eyes fell from mine. ""I do not know who you are. But you are not my brother.""

And with that he unbarred the way. He stepped to the side. The small war he had been waging was over and he had lost. I passed him by and I opened the door to the night. I could feel his eyes on my back, the eyes of a stranger. I knew as I went out from the house that the last door to the man I had been was now closed and barred forever.

The quiet dread my brother had harbored began to seep from the walls of our house and bleed into the very soil of the town. The disappearances of lone men, scattered by miles and weeks, began to spread to the public. At first it was whispers over fence posts, then a low murmur in the general store. Then, the matter was made ink and given a name in the *Creek Valley Ledger*.

""Another Traveler Vanishes on County Line Road,"" my mother read aloud one evening. Clara’s hands were frozen over the bright colors of her embroidery. Thomas stared into the fire place. I stood half swallowed by the shadow of a velvet curtain.

""Authorities issue warning,"" Mother went on. ""Travel after dark on the less frequented roads is ill advised until this… this rash of 'unexplained incidents'… has been resolved. They suspect wild animals. A bear, perhaps, or a cougar.""

In the charged stillness that followed her words, I felt the shift. Three sets of eyes, a silent and unified inquiry, turned to me, the family’s nocturnal traveler. The animal they spoke of stood among them, cloaked in the skin of their son, their brother.

In that moment, a terrible clarity descended upon me. My presence in that house was no longer a comfort but a slow and creeping contagion. My deceptions, my spectral comings and goings, my very unnatural being had not just cut the fabric of our family; the predator I contained was now casting a long and bloody shadow upon the world they inhabited. To protect what remained of them from the rot I carried within me, I had to excise myself from their lives.

It was the final and only act of love the monster I had become was capable of.

That evening, I did not retreat to my room. I remained among them, a silent witness to a life I was already outside of. I watched my mother in her chair, her nimble fingers mending a pair of Thomas’s socks. I watched Clara at the desk, the glint of lamplight on the pale gold of her hair as her lips moved silently, forming the words she composed in a letter to our aunt. And I watched Thomas, who sharpened a small pocketknife with a whetstone. He never looked at me, but I knew he felt my gaze.

I committed every detail to the long, empty vaults of my memory. 

The gentle slope of my mother’s shoulders. 

The nervous way Clara tucked a stray wisp of hair behind her ear. 

The hard calluses on my brother's hands. 

I was burning these memories into my endless mind, a final, perfect memory of all I was about to abandon.

Hours later, when the house lay in the absolute stillness, I made my preparations. I had packed nothing. My old life required things. My new one required only me. 

I took the small amount of money I had. In my room, a hard knot formed in my throat. 

I took up a pen and on a single sheet of foolscap, I composed my last lie.

*Dearest Family,*

*I must go away. There is a sickness in me that I cannot cure by staying here, a restlessness in my spirit that will do more harm if I remain. Please, do not try to look for me. Do not grieve for me. Think of me only as having set out on a long journey. I know you will not understand, but know that I am doing this because I love you all more than words can say.*

*Yours in memory,*

*Leo*

The ink was not yet dry when I laid the note upon my pillow. I slipped from my room and stood for one final moment in the upstairs hall. Their heartbeats, a steady, tripartite rhythm of life, was the last true music I would ever hear.

I descended the stairs and went out into the night. I did not take the car. I would simply walk. I would walk until the sun became a threat on the horizon, and then I would find shelter and wait for the darkness to grant me passage once more.

And that all happened in 1918. 

That was the last time I ever saw my family. 

The world went on. It remade itself and remade itself again. Quiet towns became loud cities.

I learned to live in the spaces between. Chicago. New Orleans. San Francisco. New York. I never stayed long in one place. My face did not change and people, in time, would notice.

I was once a watchman in a factory that built weapons for a war my brother may have fought in. 

I was once a bartender in a jazz club full of smoke. I served liquor to men and women who thought their lives were endless. Their beating hearts told me a different story.

I became the predator Julian had envisioned. Clean. Quiet. Untraceable. I learned to hunt other predators. The brutes in back alleys, the swindlers who fed on the hope of others. It was a rule I made for myself, a small thing to keep the man I had been from turning to dust inside me.

But my family did not turn to dust. My curse was a perfect and unforgiving memory. Their faces did not fade. The final quiet evening in the sitting room was a scene I could not forget. I learned that love did not require a beating heart, and grief did not scuff or wear with the passing of years.

As time went on I began my search for them, I dug through the dry archives of counties and the records of men. I peered into the lit screens of microfilm, and later, swam in the great black ocean of the internet.

I found it all, piece by agonizing piece.

In a society paper from 1925, I found Clara’s wedding announcement. She had married a doctor from Philadelphia. There was a photograph, a grainy black-and-white image. She was beautiful in the style of the day. She looked happy. I hoped the man was a good man. I hoped he made her laugh. I wondered if she ever spoke of her brother who was lost.

One night in the archives of a Midwestern city, I found the name of my brother. It was on a list of men who had fought in the Second World War. *Thomas Alden Croft. Private First Class.* He had survived. He was the man our father would have wanted him to be.

The decades passed like the turning of a page. It was the 1950s. On a buzzing microfilm screen, I found the notice of my mother’s death. Eleanor Croft, 1878-1952. An obituary. *Beloved mother of Clara Bellweather and Thomas Croft… Preceded in death by her husband, George, and her son, Leo, who disappeared many years ago…*

The year is 2025. A six lane highway is in place where the service road used to be. Cars move at a faster speed, their passengers are lost in small, glowing screens. I stand at its edge.

When the sun is a final red smear on the horizon, the ache begins. It is not the hunger. I cross the manic highway, slipping through the river of traffic like smoke, and enter the quiet of the woods. Some of the old trees are still here.

I come out into the town cemetery. It has grown in the last century, a creeping city of stone that has swallowed the fields. I walk past the new graves. My feet know the way to the old section, where the marble has been worn soft and blind by a hundred years of rain.

I stand before a simple family plot, marked by a cross of graying stone. My heart always feels as if it tries to beat here. I kneel on the cool grass. My eyes do not need the light to read the names.

I touch the first stone.

*ELEANOR CROFT*
*BELOVED WIFE AND MOTHER*
*1878 - 1952*

A long life. She had seen her grandchildren. I hope they were a comfort to her.

Next to her lies my sister.

*CLARA BELLWEATHER (NÉE CROFT)*
*A LIFE FULL OF GRACE*
*1902 - 1988*

She saw a man walk on the moon. Did she tell her children a ghost story about the pale brother who walked into the night and never returned?

And Thomas. Brave, honest Thomas.

*THOMAS ALDEN CROFT*
*A DEVOTED HUSBAND AND FATHER*
*1904 – 1965*

He died too young. The war had perhaps taken its payment late. Or life had. He had been a better brother than I was given the right to be.

Then there is the last spot. A marker for my father, his dates ending just before my own story began. And next to it is a wide and hollow stretch of green earth. There is no stone for me. The boy named Leo Croft had simply vanished. This empty ground is my only monument. I am forever here beside them, and forever gone.

This is all that is left of the boy who grieved for his father one hundred and seven years ago. My grief is not gone. It has been made pure and eternal. Julian was wrong. He did not cauterize the wound. He encased it in amber. The pain of their loss is as it was in the first moment.

The moon is high now. My lone shadow falls long across their graves. I am alone now. For all the time that is left. The hunger, the hunt, the life in the shadows, that is not the curse.

This is the curse. This vigil. This memory that will not fade. This is the horror. To be a living monument to a dead love, haunting the graves of my own past. 

Forever. ",5,1750793028.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Been involved with the discussion here for X amount of years, and it's the same show.

Largely, it's Mind talking with Mind. Mind is thought. So one thought after another.

Coffee, weed, alcohol. Whatever other stimulants. And off it goes: gooning over the idea of it. Mental masturbation.

Then there's the tension of it, the claim to ownership, Ego.

I'm better than you. You're better than me. We're better than them. They don't understand us. You don't understand me. I don't understand you.

The same show, over and over.

As of late I appreciate /u/Diced-Sufferable and /u/Cyberfury. They're honest. Living it, without pretense and excuse. And neither of them will see this before it's deleted.

""Why do you delete your posts and comments?"" Headaches. When these words are met and thought about, or you think about the writer objectively, as some thing, it hurts.

Thinking...hurts.

So with that, I wipe my hands of the mess and bid you all (the three people who see this) farewell.

8:15am admitted to hospital
8:30am had several awesome nurses get me comfortable, drew blood,placed iv line,hooked up ECG,asked a million questions and all of them shared my raw sense of humor which immediately put me at ease. I warned them I had to pee all the time and they promised to put 1 of those wick away banana things in my crotch so I could let it all go when the urge hit me. 
9:15am anesthesiologist came in. He mentioned the process of general anesthesia and I told him he might want to check with the EP as I was informed it would be Twighlight.  I told him I didn't care either way but begged him to knock me the fuck out for the groin numbing,incisions and catheter snaking!!! He checked and confirmed it was not general unless they had unexpected findings during the initial study. 
9:30am EP came to see if I was ready and if I had any questions.He went over the plan and I agreed,if necessary, for a blood transfusion or pacemaker if need be. A nurse came in to shave right and left groin areas,but was pleased I regularly shave a landing strip ..so there's that. 
10am Rolled into Surgery/Cath Lab. 6 or 7 people were on my squad. They put on my favorite 80's rock station and they sang with me. The worst part seemed when they applied the freezing cold large (?grounding?) patches on my back.They were going slow and careful.I said ""Just put them on quick! Like when you walk into a cold swimming pool and the water just about hits your butt Crack! Just do it!"" They secured my hands down so I wouldn't move or ""try to help them"". They placed an oxygen clip under-into my nose. They confirmed my name again. I felt a rush,high feeling and asked if they just gave me something.1 person said ""I don't think so?"" Then it was total lights out. Thank God..LOL. No pain,nothing felt. I think the anesthesiologist realized I might get a bit psycho and took my anxiety seriously! I woke up briefly and saw the EP looking at my heart on a big screen tv,but I didn't have my glasses on so I couldn't see what was happening and dozed off. 
12:30pm Arrived back in my room. EP came in. He couldn't trigger the SVT but found 3 abnormal pathways that were probably the source of my problem and ablated them. 
I had to lay flat for 2.5 hours. Super uncomfortable!! I had a headache,but I knew it was from not having coffee. After drinking 3 warm cups of coffee, while laying flat, through a angled straw, I was good to go. 
The only med they prescribed was 1 aspirin a day for 30 days.
Today my left groin area is sore but just alittle. No pain on right side. My chest feels a bit tight and sore but no big deal. I'm icing both incision sites every couple of hours which I feel is so important and helpful. I'm tired and shakey, but I will continue to lounge completely both today and tomorrow.  I don't want to fuck this up! I will shoot for thursday to go back to work as i feel I will be ready.In a few hours I will take off my groin bandages and shower. So if you don't hear back from me, I bled out😂. 
I understand your fears out there in Reddit land!! I had an amazing experience and if I had to do it again for whatever reason, I would in a ""heartbeat"".

1ljkbdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1ljkbdk/aita_for_still_being_unable_to_get_over_and_move/,"AITA for still being unable to ""get over"" and move past my boyfriend's emotionally insensitive actions and reactions after my abortion?","To start, (35F) and my partner (39M) have been together for almost 2.5 years. We moved fast in the beginning, things were so easy and we are just best friends, great communication, chemistry, things in common - we both love to hike, read, art, etc. We both truly feel like soulmates, both past divorced from our first partners, etc. He is usually very thoughtful, surprising me with coffee every Thursday from the beginning, bringing me food, cooking breakfast and lunch, etc. He definitely has a very protective demeanor and works very hard. We also are both ambitious with good jobs. We laughed a lot but he teases a lot out of love which is usually fine.

Slowly over time, he did state that he was taking things more seriously, so things I was doing around the house etc suddenly wasn't good enough. We'd have family time, but each time he had good things to say, but always critiques, like I'm not thoughtful enough, I keep forgetting things like unplugging the rice if I open it first, etc. I ask what I can do to be more thoughtful, he says he doesn't know, and that if he told me it doesn't count. I would keep trying, but it was always not enough. I started making coffee for him the night before, I missed a few days and then he brought it up that it caused him to lose trust, and didn't understand that I felt that was a little harsh after a few mistakes. Also, issues of me offering to do things like dishes, and he'd turn down my offers so I'd stop asking, and he'd get frustrated at me that I wasn't helping (he'd often get to them first so I couldn't just do them without asking).

Fast forward to a month ago, we're both childfree by choice and I've considered getting sterilized. I am on BC, and take it as directed, but somehow got pregnant anyway. It was a shock, and he was very supportive at first, it was very conflicting and I was struggling mentally, but followed through with a medical termination. He's not typically an overly emotional guy, but I am and was struggling and the night before my appointment I asked him how he was feeling, he made a ""so so"" face and said he was neutral. I got hurt, and responded, and it turned into a big argument where he thought I was asking how he felt THAT SECOND, not how he felt overall. I kept trying to clarify, but to this day he denies remembering that I ever clarified and swears he thought I was demanding he feel sad that second, and he got angry and said that I reminded him of his toxic dad, throwing a pity party, etc, and ended up sleeping downstairs. I was so hurt, considering the situation, and self harmed that night which I haven't done in years.

He didn't address it the next day, I was also dealing with the mental trauma of dealing with the abortion etc, but I brought it up that night, trying to explain how I felt hurt by what he said and he wouldn't apologize, stating that he thought I was telling him what to feel (which I think it was excessive even then). I then said I hurt myself - he didn't reply. I thought he didn't hear me and moved on, but when asked later he said he did hear my ""but assumed that you just scratched yourself like you used to"". He didn't understand why that hurt me that he didn't ask.

There were many other instances though, of trying to have a conversation and get across something he did hurt me and why, and him stating his thoughts at the moment without empathy. He's so cold. Talking to him hurts and causes me anxiety because he doesn't understand me - I've been super low and suicidal, he knows that but is holding me at arms length. Even the other night when we're trying to understand each other, something new happens - he tweaked his back in the morning and I offered to help multiple times that day, taking the dogs out, grabbing dishes, etc - but he declined each time and said he didn't want to restrict himself. Then when we went to take the trash out, he came back in and asked ""Do you wanna help me?"" and I jumped up and immediately helped. Turned out he's mad that I didn't offer to help, and when I said that was unfair because he declined my help all day he says that I ""should have realized the trash was heaver and offered"". I think he feels misunderstood and I feel like I'm playing a game I can't win, and also very unsupported in one of the darkest points of my life. 

  
I don't know - he said last night that he's ready to move on and move past this, but he's willing to keep talking about it if I need to. I just don't feel like he's actually sorry or took responsibility for his actions and hurting me, and I just feel like an asshole for not just getting over it. 

TL;DR: BF is stoic in general, but very physically supportive (footrubs, bringing and cooking food, etc) but after an abortion he is not being empathetic and denies things that I said in arguments which makes me feel crazy, just generally not caring or apologizing with a ""but..."" when he hurts my feelings because he stands behind what he was feeling at the time.

Hey, MaximizeMe crew! 🌟 Ever have one of those days where your brain feels like a browser with 97 open tabs? 🙄 Yeah, me too. But I stumbled upon something that might just be the trick to rebooting your energy without a gallon of coffee or a 3-hour nap. Curious? Let me tell you about my little 7-day experiment with diaphragmatic breathing.

**Why Breathing? Isn't that, like, automatic?**

Sure, we all breathe. But how often do we breathe *right*? Diaphragmatic breathing, also known as ""belly breathing,"" is apparently the cheat code for a calmer mind and a less stressed body. It’s so simple, even a sloth could do it. 🦥 But here's the kicker: it’s backed by actual studies showing decreased cortisol—basically, it's like giving stress the finger and saying ""not today!""

**The Week of Breathing Adventures:**

- **Day 1: The Awkward Start 🤷‍♂️**  
  I felt like I was learning to walk again. Breathe in through the nose, let the belly expand, breathe out through the mouth. What’s that? Belly not moving? Oops.

- **Day 3: Less Weird, More Zen 🙏**  
  It started feeling kind of natural. I realized I was catching my stress and, instead of texting my BFF about my breakdown, I just… breathed.

- **Day 5: Cortisol Who? 👐**  
  Work was chaos. Dogs barking, emails flying in like spam missiles. But somehow, I drowned out the noise with my new breathing groove. I'm telling you, I felt like some kind of unshakable Jedi.

- **Day 7: Achievement Unlocked 🕺🏻**  
  Focused? Check. Energy levels? Up. Stress? Down. Who knew putting in a little breathing work could feel like discovering a secret brain switch?

**Why You Might Wanna Try This:**

- It’s **free**. In an economy where anything *free* is worth trying, right?
- **5 minutes a day**—you got that time. Just think of it as Instagram scrolling but for your lungs.
- Ever wanted to look cool while doing yoga? Now you actually know one of the poses. 😉

In all honesty, it felt like I hit refresh on my whole system. And while I might not be a Zen master just yet, this simple practice was a game-changer for my focus and stress levels.

So, have you ever tried diaphragmatic breathing? Would you? Let’s chat about how this underrated superpower could help you, too. 🗣️✨",1,1750792459.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Everyone whispered it was a fairytale, but Sarah was trapped, a silent prisoner in a gilded cage.
Her world crumbled when Marcus, the man who'd allegedly 'saved' her, began using her parents' struggling diner as ruthless leverage, threatening them with prison.
Then, his mistress Tiffany arrived, turning Sarah's home into a stage for relentless humiliation.
Marcus's cruelty escalated: from gaslighting his infidelity to forcing Sarah into a childhood trauma trigger - a dark, rat-infested root cellar.
He even publicly shamed her with leaked childhood photos and doused her in greasy dishwater at a high-society event.
The betrayal was absolute.
How could the man who promised her the world become her tormentor?
Why did he constantly break her down?
In despair, Sarah decided she couldn't escape him alive.
She contacted her childhood chemist friend, Evie, for an untraceable substance.
Her grim plan: a final, shared exit.
But Evie's ""poison"" wasn't what Sarah thought.
It was a reversible sedative, designed not for an end, but for Sarah's ultimate freedom and Marcus's brutal, surprising reckoning.

Chapter 1
Sarah Thorne, born Sarah Miller, stood by the floor-to-ceiling window.

New York City glittered below, a sea of lights that never sl**t.

People on the street, if they looked up, might see her silhouette in the penthouse of Thorne Tower.

They would think she had everything.

The wife of Marcus Thorne, tech mogul, billionaire.

A fairytale, they called it in the papers.

Sarah knew the whispers.

""She's so lucky.""

""He saved her from that awful little town.""

The faint scent of old diner grease and stale coffee, a smell she thought clung to her skin no matter how many expensive perfumes Marcus bought, always made her feel like an imposter in this world.

This particular perfume, ""Appalachian Wildflower,"" was his creation for her, a constant reminder of where she came from, and who he thought she was.

She touched the cold glass, her reflection a pale, silent woman.

Lucky was not the word she would use.

Marcus entered the room, his presence filling it instantly.

He didn't look at her, his attention on a tablet in his hand.

""The press are having a field day with those charity photos,"" he said, his voice smooth, pleasant. ""You looked... appropriate.""

Sarah flinched internally at the word. Appropriate. Not beautiful, not happy.

She turned, offering a small, practiced smile.

He finally looked up, his eyes cold, assessing.

""Good. Keep that up.""

Then, his expression shifted, a flicker of something dark.

""I trust you haven't been dwelling on... unhelpful thoughts.""

Dread, cold and familiar, settled in Sarah's stomach.

Unhelpful thoughts meant any thought that wasn't complete devotion to him.

The next day, he showed her the live feed.

Her parents, looking small and worried, stood outside their struggling diner in West Virginia.

The diner he had ""saved"" by paying off its debts.

""A charmingly rustic establishment,"" Marcus said, his tone light, almost gentle. ""It would be a shame if, say, a sudden tax audit revealed irregularities. Or if health inspectors found something... unsanitary. People go to prison for less, Sarah.""

He zoomed in on her mother's tired face.

""They're old. Prison would be very hard on them.""

Intense fear gripped Sarah, making it hard to breathe.

Helplessness washed over her. He owned her, every part of her, even her family's fate",1,1750792352.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

	All the right words clogged my throat like a dirty dish rag. Instead only meaningless nonsense poured out. 



	“Nice day isn’t it.” My voice years out of season and my company barely noticed the words. They blended into the ambient background. Nothing more than the bird songs that flitted across the lake. They served the same purpose with none of the efficacy.



Her only response was a thin smile and nod. She was propped back on elbows in a pose I’d seen a thousand times before, laying on the same blanket we always laid on. Some red and white checkered heirloom that could be anything from my grandmother’s heirloom, to a thrift store pick up. It didn’t matter. Now it was going to take on a new meaning. The platform that everything started… or…



“Did your parents lend you the money?” She asked absently, eyes closed as the sun took her in its arms. 



They hadn’t. 



	“I don’t know. Still waiting to hear back.” 



	“Mmm.” She mused, not really listening. 



	It was early in the day, the sun not quite hot yet, the wind not offensive in its occasional appearances. Nearby a family of squirrels watched on curiously, not a care in the world. It really was a nice day. So far. 



	“How are things with Landon?” I asked, trying to ease my way into this.



	“Ugh, don’t ruin the mood. He can rot and fester. I hope they find him washed up on a shore somewhere.” 



	I swallowed nervously. Kady always had a bit of an edge to her. One I had been cutting myself on for years. Black swirls ran up one arm, black ink that had faded from shadow the shading. Swirls that looked like the smoke that dribbled from her lips, a white stick dangling from rose tinted lips. 



	I looked down at my mustard colored shirt, khaki pants, sensible shoes–Orthopedic–and wondered for the 17th time today what I was doing. 



	Throwing everything away for a chance I guess. I was never a risk taker. I would throw milk out a week before its expiration date. But, sometimes you can’t have cereal without milk. 



	“Kady, we’ve been friends for a long time right?” 



	She finally opened her eyes a fraction, staring off into the blue sky for too many seconds. 

*Had I already messed this up?*



	“Rory. You’re standing at a crossroads right now, and you can make a choice. Once you make it there’s no going back. Your words can’t be unmade once you squeeze them out into the world. Are you sure you wanna take this step?” 



	She leveled her eyes on me and it was like I’d been slapped. I’d never actually been slapped. The last time someone hurt me was a pinch and I had struggled not to cry.



	I opened my mouth to speak but she cut me off.



	“Take a moment. Think about it. It’s a nice day. We don’t have to rush.” 



	She closed her eyes again, taking in the sun. They had been friends for so long that the silence was as comfortable a companion as anyone else. They often said more with nothing at all than any words. This was what made this so hard. 



	Beyond the torn jeans, the black tank, the smell of cigarette smoke, and pale scars that had almost faded, I saw the girl that I had grown up with. The one who’s smile used to be brighter than the sun. The girl I had confessed my love for nearly a decade ago, and who had politely turned me down. I thought that would be the end of it at the time, but we were eleven. You can move on from heartbreak easier back then. The heart was more elastic. Now, years of longing had made it brittle. I knew that the next tap would shatter it. 



	But I wanted cereal. 



	“You know it’s tough to make a heartfelt confession when you already know everything I’m going to say.” I said, a sheepish smile pulling at my lips.



	“Well you’re as subtle as a 12 gauge to the teeth. How long were you digging for this blanket by the way?” 



	My cheeks burned and I didn’t answer. In truth I had spent a few hours digging through boxes to find it. It was the same blanket I had confessed on the first time. I wasn’t sure why I thought things would go better this time around. If anything this blanket was bad luck. 



	“Oh it was just lying around, I thought it’d be fitting.” I said casually. 



	“Well, you’re not wrong there.” 



	“Kady I can’t… do this anymore.” I finally eked out. 



	Her eyes were still closed but he was pretty sure she saw them roll them. “You know I hate melodrama Rory. What can’t you do?”



	“Be your friend.” 



	“*Be My Friend.”* 



	The words came out at the same time. 



	“You’re predictable lad.” 



	“Sometimes the truth is obvious I guess.” I said, he began to get up.



	“So you were just pretending all this time?”



	“No, you know that’s not what-”



	“When my dad was beating the shit out of me and you gave me a place to stay, you were just pretending?”



	I had cleared out the guest room and we stayed up all night playing Mario Kart. We alternated between laughing and crying all night. 



	“Kady stop, you…”



	“Were you pretending when you spent the whole summer with me helping me get my grades up?” 



	That was more of a favor to myself. Everyday was a vacation. I would get us coffee and have Kady all to myself for hours at a time.



	“Kady…”



	“I guess this was all just an elaborate ploy just to FUCK me wasn’t it.” She said, her eyes snapping open, her smile serpentine. 



	“Fuck you!” I finally said, tears actually pricking my eyes. 



	“I know you want to.” She said with a laugh. “But answer me this before you pack up this musty blanket and run home.” 



	I didn’t say anything, I just stared through red defiant eyes.



	“If we got together like you want, and I agreed to date you, would you be ok never fucking me? Or is that a dealbreaker for you?” 



	“I uh…” The question caught me off guard. I loved her. Of course I wanted intimacy, but I loved her for a 1,000 other reasons besides. Just being around her made it a nice day. “No… No it wouldn’t. I’d be ok with that.” 



	She leaned me, inches from my face, “I guess you weren’t pretending then. Go home and get ready.” 



	“Get ready? For what?” I said quickly standing, trying to collect the blanket, that she was still on. Kady fixed me with a level look.



	“For our date tonight. You’re gonna take me to dinner, and we’re gonna go down that road.” 



	Today was my last nice day, and my first great day.

I highly prefer meeting someone for coffee sooner rather than later these days... and if they happen to link their insta on their dating profile I might take a peek... but even so I don't like doing that bc it really tells me nothing about who they are in real life.

I mean, many of you know this power of moka, it can really extract all the juices from fairly humble beans.

But this coffee is something.

I don't know much about coffee processing, but as far as I understand, this is some sort of soft anaerobic.

It doesn't have an aggressive yeast or alcohol smell, and frankly you still get a lot of regular castillo behind all this magic. But the magic is definitely there. Very sweet with a gentle, suddenly not-so-typical-colombian-acidity.

If your roaster works with this lot, it's definitely worth a try. I did it in a classic 3-cup moka with preheated water and a fairly coarse grind, which is what I usually use for beans I'm not familiar with, but I could definitely have ground it finer and it would be even sweeter.",5,1750792151.0,mokapot,0,0.86,False

Our lives are a series of moments in time, big and little. The *big* moments always seem to take precedence over the little moments.  When we are asked to reflect on what was important or what had the most significant impact, the answer is usually things like weddings, births, vacations, or graduations. But really, it’s all the *little* moments that truly matter… Having all your children present at the dinner table, the conversations to and from practice, all the youth baseball games you attended to watch your child play, every book you read to you child or grandchild, every morning coffee with a loved one, each workout with a friend,  each time you sat with a grandparent and talked, all the kisses goodnight, all the I love you’s, all the daily hellos and goodbyes with friends and family. All the millions of little moments in our lives with the people we love, all the interactions with the ones we care about. Cherish *these* moments. Because you might not realize it, but kids grow up. People get old. Friends move away. Life and time do not stand still. Our daily routine with the people around us will eventually change. That is just a part of living. And what remains are the memories we hold on to. So don’t take for granted the *little* moments that make up your life. In the end, they are more meaningful than all the big moments combined.

Did I just imagine it?,"Hi I(21F) have a recently new crush on my best friend’s brother(21M). I always thought he was attractive but all we ever do is like playfully tease and bully each other. I was over at my best friend’s house and we were hanging out with two other guys(my best friend’s boyfriend and one of his friends). While outside playing ping pong and darts her brother comes home and sees us outside so he came outside to join us. Everyone was playing darts at this point and I was standing by the ping pong table so him and I started playing together he teases me and I tease him back, we make each other laugh a lot and we’re just talking and maintaining good eye contact. I could even feel him staring at me when the ball fell off the table and I had to go get it all the normal stuff I’m not sure why but I always feel tension around him not like bad tension like good “make your skin crawl” or you can just feel someone like they’re right beside you but they aren’t. 

Night goes on and we decide to switch up to a drinking game. I help him set it up and we went to grab the stuff and tension was really high when it was just us(at least to me). The game involved us throwing and bouncing a ball to score points but it kept landing into the pool. It was only my best friend, her boyfriend, his friend and myself playing but her brother decided to stay and watch to keep score. During the game he kept doing the same thing teasing and talking to me and i’d obviously do it back. Since the ball had landed into the pool multiple times I just decided to jump in and get it while full clothed. We played some more before the other guys had to leave so they did. It was getting cold at this point and I said that out loud and my best friends brother asked if I wanted sweats which my best friend said none of hers would fit me because they would be too big. He asked if I would be comfortable wearing his and I said sure so he brought me some and I changed into a t-shirt and his sweats. 

I came back outside and my best friend went into the house to go to the bathroom but she was gone for like an hour. During that time him and I played the game some more and he taught me about the rules since he didn’t finish before he said “I was trying to explain the rules earlier but no one was listening” and I said “tell them to me I was listening” he looked kind of taken aback by that. The alcohol courage helped and we talked a lot while we played. He asked if i wanted a drink of his drink i said sure and I said the game was kinda boring because my friend drank all the drinks. He said do you want a drink I can go get you one. So we did and I followed him through the house but stopped before the garage when he went into thinking oh he’ll just pick something out. He calls from the other room and is like “are you going to come here and pick?”. Again tension is hella high when we’re alone so I was kind of like I shouldn’t but I did. We got one we head back out and continue playing and talking while we played I lift my hands up to stretch forgetting his sweats are too big around my waist and when my shirt lifts you can see my underwear band. He glances down and stares at it for a good bit before I put my hands down after stretching. 

After a little my friend comes back and asks us if we wanted to watch a movie we both said sure. Before we go inside with my friend he asks if I want to shotgun a drink I said why not and he pops one open for me and helps me know how to do it. At this point he’s really close and I feel it. I couldn’t finish mine so I just said he could have it and left to sit on the couch with my friend. It’s an L couch so my friend is laying and in the turn of the L leaving room on both sides I decide to sit on the small side beside her and her brother sits on the end next to me. He gets up thinking that he smells and puts on cologne and comes back. This is when I think I lost all sense because it was strong and I love a good smelling cologne. I was still kinda cold so I told my friend and her brother takes off his jacket and hands it to me and I just kinda stare at him and he’s like do you want it or not. So I put it on. 

We put on a movie and turn off all the lights it was a horror movie. It was very disturbing but during the movie him and I are whispering and talking same with my friend and every time he talks to me I turn and hold eye contact with him while we talk and he does the same. I KNOW I KEEP SAYING “TENSION” but this eye contact had it I don’t know what else to say plus the fact he was right by me just inches away. He’s over here asking me what haircut he should get or if he should just keep his hair and wether or not he smells and he puts his hand in my face wanting me to smell it. I start to get paranoid and hear noises in the house the usual thing you get when you watch a scary movie and he jokes and says “the ghosts are going to get you” I playfully shove him and tell him to shut up he’s all smiles. My friend falls asleep at like 3am for some reason he’s still out on the couch with me even though she’s asleep TENSION HIGH. 

We put on a new movie and get blankets my blanket is too small so my feet show he points it out and I call him weird and tell him the blanket isn’t big enough so he tosses his blanket over my legs as well. We whisper to one and other and keep talking and the dogs get up on the couch right next to him pushing him closer to me. We’re like almost elbows touching at this point and I start getting fidgety. it’s like 4am at this point and he was starting to fall asleep. I laid my head down like I would be laying in a bed and asked how he was comfortable sitting like how he was and he said he wasn’t and then slid down and laid down like I was. We’re basically arm to arm at this point and it’s 4:30am I ask him why he’s still out here and he says “I don’t know” a few more minutes roll by and it’s now 5am so I tell him he must be uncomfortable he should just go into his room. He says he hasn’t because the dog is laying on the blanket so I get up and say he can get out the opposite way on the side I was laying on. He hesitates for a second before pulling the blanket from under his dog and going to his room. 

The next morning it was like nothing happened. We didn’t talk to one and another and I made sure to stay by my friend’s side. We just exchanged glances and I could feel him staring at me. My friend and I go to get coffee and he asks if we can pick him up one so I pay for his as like a thanks for the sweats and jacket. It’s been 2 days now the tension is still there but now we don’t talk and it’s like we stay far away from one and other. I think i’m just delusional and it was one sided tension and he was just being kind.",1,1750791866.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

The only option is to manually delete your non-sleep hours OR turn privacy mode on/off manually *every day*?
Dude… my coffee maker has a freaking timer, but a $10k “smart” bed does not? 
I hang out in my bed a lot. It’s the *only* place in my very crowded, 3-generation home where I have personal space lol so I watch TV in bed… i read… or doom scroll on my phone… Hang out with my dogs or cats (although none of them generally *sleep* in bed with us)… And often times my cats congregate in here during the day when I’m gone. 
There is zero chance I would remember or even *want* to edit my actual sleep times every day. 
And it would be super easy for them to literally just give you the option to tell your bed to only track between X and X hours… So why haven’t they done it? 
Because of this I will never truly get into tracking how my sleep went or if it’s getting better or worse or whatever because I only think of it every couple weeks then it’s basically useless because of how much time I spend in it not sleeping and I’m certainly not going to go back and edit each day ONE. AT. A. TIME. 
Honestly none of this should be a surprise… I regret this purchase immensely. Way too much money for a piece of crap overall and not nearly as comfortable as it should be. We have also never changed our sleep numbers (AND we both use the same number! ) so that’s just useless as well. We have a split king and nothing seems to keep the mattresses from drifting further and further apart plus the actual mattresses are Weak at the sides - and especially on my husband’s side starting to bulge out.
The only thing keeping me from buying a new bed is how much this freaking thing cost to begin with. Ugh. 
OK mostly I’m just venting but if anyone has any usable suggestions for someone who will seriously never remember to add yet one more thing to her daily to-do list…? I’m all ears. ",1,1750791765.0,sleepnumber,3,0.6,False

I wanted the effect to be the material stretching across my breasts, presenting me as a sex kitten in waiting. I wasn't sure how it would work ........","**Chapter 1: Two boobs, a hole, and a wanted pole**

A bigger dilemma of my life happened when my gay best friend unintentionally turned me on at a 'randoms' pool party. Up until that point, I'd never had the urge to do a guy, or a girl, for that matter. At twenty, I hadn't ever been attracted to anyone that wasn't a movie star. I was a late bloomer to some. To me, a relationship with a movie star would never happen, so I was safe from STD's, unwanted babies, and heartbreak when I selected which screen hottie would cause my delightful vibrated orgasm. The rabbit was an all-time favorite. ""So, Ethan, I was wondering..."" I started as if it were a normal conversation with anyone of my friends. If I wasn't so comfortable around him I wouldn't be able to ask this rather uncomfortable question. Especially since I had no way of knowing how it would change our relationship in the future. I was that comfortable with him though. His pine-green eyes shifted in my direction, giving me a quick once over before returning his attention to his book. ""Yes?""

I shifted my light blue cotton shorts higher up my thighs and grabbed the back of my black tee, pulling the excess material behind me. I wanted the effect to be the material stretching across my breasts, presenting me as a sex kitten in waiting. I wasn't sure how it would work with a gay guy –-I'm such a liar—but it was worth a try. And then the words spilled out, ""I want you to take my virginity."" Those seven words bounced off the walls of his apartment, taunting me, teasing me with their stupidity. Saying it in my mind was a different reality to saying it out loud, and Ethan's silence was killing me. What was I doing? How could I say it like that? Blurting the words out had not been the best choice. I'd even tried to make myself appealing to him. Two boobs and a hole between my legs kept insisting it wasn't possible. He liked dick. Plain and simple. What was I thinking? Resisting the urge to hide my burning face into my hands, I let my humiliation consume me as I watched him and waited. Waited for him to point and laugh, to tell me to get out for being so ridiculous, but all he did was blink at his book, a frown creasing the sides of his peach-colored lips. He peeked at me from the corner of his eyes before he turned away, looked straight ahead with a clenched jaw, and then shifted back to stare at me again. Cassie, I don't need to state the obvious,"" he said, flexing the binding of the book, making it bend under the pressure. It was settled. It was as simple as that for him; the end of the story. I felt stupid for blurting out my secret desire to have sex with him, but at least he hadn't laughed. I knew this wasn't going to be easy. I'd thought about this for a long time. I even began to consider making Ethan's boyfriend, Seth, a part of the 'devirginize Cassie' mission. It had to be Ethan and if Seth had to come as a result then I was okay with it. Seth was like a rippling supermodel. A piece of my curly brown hair fell onto a pink cheek as I sighed and folded my arms across my chest. I turned my upper body towards him and leaned closer, settling inches away from his side. ""I know you like guys. I understand that, but I don't trust anyone else to do it. You're my best friend, Ethan. And let's be honest, at the rate I'm going I won't lose it until I'm like,"" I paused, my eyes rolling upwards as I pretended to do some mental math, ""eighty. ""Don't be overdramatic. Why now? You've never cared before. I'm not gonna tell him. My two main reasons were for me and me alone. Sharing my reasons would be way too embarrassing. His glistening abs and a pair of black swim trunks at a pool party had tweaked my nether regions so much that I'd been wet-dreaming about him for months. When I realized I wanted him, a rational bug came and bit my ass, and shortly after Seth was appearing in my erotic dreams too. 'Cassie Sandwich' fantasies haunted my sleep and wake time. It's not my fault. And I'm not gonna tell him! He didn't need the confidence boost anyhow. Ethan was always walking around shirtless and Seth was touchy – as in he was always touching me or Ethan. I noticed it a few weeks ago, about three months after the incident that would end up taking over my dreams, how much Seth enjoyed physical contact too. Seth would run his fingers up my bare thighs when I had shorts on or bump me from behind with his hip. He would pat my ass and make comments about my small chest... he even took a finger and pulled the neckline of my shirt down to peek inside. All the flirtations I may not have noticed, coming from a gay guy, if my sex-drive hadn't gone into warp speed. Well? Why now?"" Ethan repeated his question. I wasn't going to let the answer 'because you and your boyfriend make me horny, Ethan' slip out, but it settled on the tip of my tongue. Biting my lip, I shrugged. ""I don't know. I guess I want to know what it feels like. A horrified expression crossed his face, but he shook his head quickly, his sandy blonde hair falling into his eyes. He clutched at the binding of his book and brought it up to his face before he spoke again. ""This isn't the 'I fell in love with my gay best friend' is it?"" I slapped a hand to my chest and let my mouth drop, faking an outraged expression. I vehemently shook my head in denial. ""Absolutely not, I just want you to stick your pole into my— He held a hand up, face-palming me. ""If you finish that sentence I'll— damn! I'm getting an unwanted visual. I scoffed. ""Hey, I happen to be very sexy. Brett Carson told me that my lips are great for sucking—I'll kill you,"" he said, his eyes darkening. He raised a thoughtful eyebrow when I kept silent. ""I didn't know Brett liked you. I shrugged. ""I didn't either. Clearly, I needed to try a different strategy. Already I let him steer me off-topic. It might've worked with Seth, Ethan's current boyfriend, but not with me. I pouted my lips, attempting a seductive look that probably just made me look constipated. ""I love you. Ethan scowled and shifted farther down the couch, away from me. ""I love you too, but I'm not deflowering you. Why not? He flinched away from my high pitched cry. ""Would you stop screaming like it's the end of the world? All I want you to do is—""

He nodded with a scoff. ""Is stick my pole in your—""

I held my hand up. ""Okay, you're right that wasn't the best word choice.""

""Ya think?""

I sighed, rolling my eyes and sweeping a hand through my hair for dramatic effect. ""It's not that big a deal, Ethan.""

""Oh really? Then let Brett do it.""

I faked a gag. ""His hands are like meat hooks and his face looks like a very ugly bulldog.""

""Well, it's not a big deal, right?""

""Ethan!"" I reached over and punched him as hard as I could, but he barely flinched.

""For argument's sake, let's say I consider this, what about Seth? Does he get a say in this? He is my boyfriend, after all.""

""Well technically, since you like guys and I'm a girl, it wouldn't really be cheating.""

He scoffed. ""That is the most retarded thing I've ever heard!"" He heaved a sigh as he discarded his book on the floor, nudging it to the side with his foot. ""You do realize that Seth is paranoid that you are gonna turn me straight.""

I frowned, stretching my legs and reaching behind me to scratch my back. ""Is that even possible?""

Ethan snorted and settled his elbows on his knees, his chin in his hands. ""No.""

I smiled. ""You're such a freak.""

He grunted.

""If it's not possible, then what's the problem? It's just sex!""

""If it was 'just sex' you wouldn't be asking me."" I thought I'd lost him, but he turned his face, settling his cheek on his palm as he stared at me. His wheat-colored brows drawn together in serious contemplation. ""Are you sure you want it to be me?""

Hell yes! I pretended to think about it for a second before I nodded slowly.

""You understand in order for me to take your virginity I have to be-um-well..."" His face burned a lobster red as he stumbled over the words.

""Turned on?""

He inhaled and then nodded.

""Yes. That's why I was thinking that maybe we could ask Seth to join us,"" I said, feeling relieved to have finally gotten it out, hoping he doesn't think less of me for wanting this.

He blinked and his lips parted. ""How did I know you would say that? And you think I'm the freak?""

Blowing on my nails with an 'I-know-something-you-don't-know' look, I nodded. ""Seth tells me things, Mr. Sub. I could be your new dom. I think I could handle a whip pretty well and how hot would I look in slutty leather?""

Ethan's face flushed ""Oh lord,"" Ethan mumbled. ""Why do I put up with you?""

The corner of my mouth lifted in a smile. ""Because you love me and I'm your snuggle bunny.""

I could see it in his eyes. He'd given in. My brain grew legs and leaped with joy as he scrubbed his hands through his hair. ""Oh man,"" he mumbled. ""I can't wait to hear what Seth has to say about this.""

""He'll want to know why he can't pop my cherry.""

Ethan groaned, his shoulders sagging, his face now hidden in his palms, ""That's exactly what he'll say.""

I patted his muscular shoulder, letting my fingers linger longer. ""We probably won't even have to talk him into it.

 **Chapter 2: You're not the Yoda of sex!**

I'm in heaven. Foot-rub heaven.

Seth was on the floor, my leg settled in his lap as he thrust his thumb along the arch of my foot. After an eight hour shift at The Coffee Barn, I purred like a cat, pointing my toes, and arching my back at the attention. I snuggled down into the suede couch at Ethan's, sinking further into the cushions, and flung an arm across my brow, humming my pleasure.

""I'll totally pop your cherry for you, Cassie,"" Seth said as he applied more pressure to my heel.



""A little to the left,"" I mumbled and lifted my arm to peek at Ethan to see his reaction.



He was scowling at Seth and cradling the cup of iced coffee I'd brought him. ""Babe, your predictability could get boring.""



Seth raised an eyebrow. ""I'm predictable? That's not what you said last night!""



Ethan pointed at me, completely ignoring his taunt. ""She knew you'd say that. Hell, I knew you'd say it."" His shoulders lifted as he inhaled and exhaled.



Only Ethan could make breathing look sexy, I thought, pretending to hide my eyes beneath my arm again, but really my eyes morphed into a hawk because I didn't want to miss a thing.



""Gorgeous, you just know me in and out,"" Seth said with a saucy wink. His cerulean blue eyes sparkled with mischief and he gave a sexy smirk as he reached over to rub up Ethan's thigh.



I nudged at his stilled hand with my ankle. ""Just because you're groping Ethan doesn't mean you get to stop rubbing my foot,"" I said.



""I'll bet she's a wild cat in bed,"" Seth said. He had one hand still on Ethan's thigh, but the hand that had been rubbing my foot slide up my bare leg.



I smacked at his wandering hand. ""Don't be dirty.""



Seth snorted. ""Says the girl that wants to be deflowered.""



""And what I don't understand is why? Stay a virgin,"" Ethan said, crossing a leg over his knee, effectively blocking Seth's hand. ""Once you lose it, it's gone and you can't get it back.""



He was twenty-one, a whopping one year older than me, and he was talking like he was a knowledgeable old man? I wasn't asking him to do this because he was an expert. I was asking because I felt safe with him and telling me to not lose my virginity wasn't going to change my mind.



""Well, thank you, Yoda, for that insightful speech. Are you a virgin, Ethan?"" I raised an eyebrow and folded my arms across my chest.



""No.""



""Are you sexually active?""



Ethan's face flushed—God, he's cute. He raised his iced coffee to his lips and took a sip before speaking. ""Yes.""



""Daily, in fact... sometimes three times a day. In the bathroom, on the bed, in the kitchen... on the kitchen,"" Seth said, his grin widening with every lip nibble or nervous hand that swept through Ethan's hair. ""You know, he's a screamer, Cass?""



""So you've informed me, multiple times. Just last week,"" I said dully.



It was true. Seth was all about the 'shock' factor and if he could put someone in an uncomfortable position he'd do it every time. Seth's frequent conversations about their sex life could have been half of the trigger to what made me notice a glistening wet Ethan that day. They're both drool-worthy, no one would deny that, but the idea that it had been Seth's fault from the beginning was there.



Why wasn't he rubbing my foot anymore? I scowled at him



""Seth, please!"" I cried out, once again nudging his fingers with the tips of my toes. His large hand immediately started again.



""The point is Cassie right now. Not our sex life,"" Ethan said, a deep growl rumbling in his chest. ""By the way,"" he kicked at Seth with his foot, ""I want to talk to you about that!""



""About what?"" Seth asked.



""About how much information you share with Cassie. Why do you do that?""



Seth smirked. ""Next time I do it, be sure to watch her face.""



I frowned. ""What is that supposed to mean?""



Seth raised an eyebrow and tilted his head. ""Has anyone ever told you your lips were made to be wrapped around a cock?""



Ethan gasped and turned his head towards me looking scandalized. ""Didn't you tell me the other day that Brett said something like that to you?""



I nodded and frowned deeper. ""Yeah. He did.""



""That's because I'm the one that brought it to his attention,"" Seth said with a chuckle.



""Did you now? And why were you talking to Brett again? And about 'cocks' no less?"" Ethan asked.



Brett was the type of guy that didn't care if he got it from a dog just so long as he was getting some —guys, girls, threesomes, moresomes— the drunker the better, party type of guy.



""He's right, Cass. Stay a virgin,"" Seth said, trying to change the subject. His sarcasm let me know he was on my side though.



""Smooth, Seth. Real smooth,"" I said, nudging his hand with my foot again. ""Would you stop stopping? I'm in pain here!""



""I've always loved the way you beg me!"" He grabbed my big toe and wiggled it.



""And what makes you two think you're qualified to tell me to stay a virgin or not? Just because you've had sex, doesn't mean you're the Yoda of it,"" I said.



Seth glanced at me, raising an eyebrow and turned to Ethan. It was a 'you handle this' look and I knew that I'd said something they both disagreed with.



Oh, joy. Seth, you traitor!



Ethan didn't seem to have a problem answering either as he shifted on the couch and settled against my shoulder, dropping his head next to mine. ""You're right, it doesn't mean I'm 'Yoda' of sex, but I've had it, unlike you. So I know what you're asking for, something you don't fully understand. Not to mention, you're a girl. I've never had sex with a girl, but it's clear the first time for a girl versus a guy is completely different.""



I frowned, ignoring most of what he said except for the part about not having sex with a girl. ""How did you know you were gay if you've never had sex with a girl?"" I asked. I didn't want to deviate too much from the main topic, but it niggled my curiosity bone.



Seth chuckled. ""First of all, how do you know you're straight if you've never had sex with a guy? Are you battin' for girls town and don't even know it? Probably not. Plus, he's on the football team, Cass.""



That wasn't really an answer.



I shrugged. ""So? Lots of guys are.""



Seth turned, lifted his arms up to rest over my bare thighs, and stared at me pointedly. ""Think about it, hon. He's popular, he looks like a fucking sex god, he hasn't come out yet, and therefore cheerleaders are bouncing around in his face with those tight little outfits. When a male has no reaction to that but has to run into the restroom when the guys are changing in the locker room because he gets a boner, well that's a pretty damn big sign.""



""That happened once and it was before you,"" Ethan said, his shoulders stiffening.



""You never told me about that."" I scowled, drawing back my elbow to land a gentle blow to his midriff. His surprised grunt in my ear sent tingles down my spine.



""Hey,"" he grumbled, rubbing his stomach.



""Why didn't you ever tell me? We've been friends since kindergarten and I thought we told each other everything."" I wasn't terribly upset about it, but it seemed like an important event in his life that I should've known about. He turned so that he was facing the side of my head, his body leaning towards me.



""If you remember, I didn't actually come out to you until I was fifteen. That happened when I was thirteen. Besides, you know how my family is.""



I frowned. I did know how his family was and it had always been a sore spot for him. Honestly, I think if he told them he was gay they'd be fine with it, but I could see why he'd be hesitant to say anything. At his family cookouts, the guys wrestled. They called each other 'fags' and 'pussies' and went out of their way to make people laugh or feel uncomfortable. They did it with innuendoes or just a plain old beat down, but it was always in good fun. No one ever complained, except for the females when they got too rowdy. His family was all about sports too. Hunting, fishing, real manly men stuff, as I'd heard Ethan's Uncle Ted refer to them on occasion.



""They love you, Ethan, and you know what your dad would say if he found out? That he still loved you and how you got your jollies off was your business,"" I said, wanting to reassure him.



Seth snickered. ""I'd imagine he'd want to have the talk with me too.""



""The talk?"" I asked curiously.



""Where he threatens me with a shovel? I'll bet he'd even pull out all the stops and include your Uncle Ted too.""



I snorted and nodded enthusiastically. ""He would.""



""It took me fifteen years to come out to you, Cass, and you're my person. My family is just a different story,"" Ethan said, sounding tired and defeated.



My heart clenched at the Grey's Anatomy reference. It was another thing Ethan was 'in the closet' about. He was a Grey's Anatomy junkie. The three of us would have a crash course marathon of the last season just before the new season came out so we would be up-to-date on everything that happened. Of course, Ethan usually watched every season before that crash marathon.



""So you knew you were gay before you were born?"" I asked skeptically.



Ethan shrugged. ""I knew something was different when I was old enough to understand.""



I pushed my bottom lip out in a pout, deciding to finally let him know his previous comment got to me. I twisted my upper body enough to reach for him, pulling him tightly to my chest. ""You're my person too,"" I said, letting my voice crack with emotion as my arms wrapped around his neck. ""That's why I want you to do this for me.""



His strong arms wrapped around me but his shoulders slumped. ""I love you, Cassie, and in a perfect world, I wouldn't be gay. You'd be my soul mate,"" he whispered into my neck. ""It's just not a perfect world, but I'll try-""



""It's a perfect world because you're in it,"" I said back.



Seth cleared his throat and made a thumping noise against his chest. ""You know, you're lucky shit like that doesn't piss me off anymore.""



Feeling guilty, I pulled away. ""Sorry.""



In the beginning of Seth and Ethan's relationship, Seth had expressed some agitation when Ethan and I spoke to each other that way. I thought, until that day, that the way we spoke to each other was natural. I tried to distance myself out of respect for their relationship, but we all ended up being miserable, and luckily it was Seth that realized it. Seth sat me down and told me how sorry he was, that if he didn't like Ethan so much it wouldn't have bothered him. After that, the three of us became inseparable, and Seth warmed up to me fast. Seth mentioning that it used to tick him off made me feel even guiltier for making this request, but I could never trust anyone else as much as I trusted them.



Seth reached over and smacked the side of my upper thigh, causing me to squeal as the sting knocked me out of my thoughts. ""Just the way you two are. I've gotten used to it. Now, let's get back on topic... sex!""



There was such seriousness to his voice that I pulled back from Ethan, resting my hands on either side of my hips. The pause that followed had me biting my bottom lip before lifting my hands and rubbing my thighs vigorously. The tension thickened as the topic of the conversation switched. I swallowed as I shifted against Ethan once again and inhaled sharply. I was turned just enough towards him that I could feel the tip of my breast brushing against his arm and every time I moved, chills shot through my body.



Gawd, I'm so dirty but talk about a crowd-pleaser.



I didn't even care that Seth had stopped rubbing my aching feet anymore and it seemed like the perfect time to ask again. ""So will you?"" I asked. ""I mean, Seth seems to be okay with it?"" I raised an eyebrow in Seth's direction, his nod confirmed it, but the indecision in Ethan's face as he glanced at Seth made my stomach hurt.



Ethan cleared his throat and bowed his head, sliding his hands up my calf, kneading gently. ""I knew you were serious, but I think it's only now just sinking in.""



Seth completely stopped rubbing my calf in favor of sliding his roughened fingers further up towards my thigh. My breath caught and my eyes widened as I followed his movements. ""You both know I'm not completely turned off by girls,"" Seth added.



I held my breath at the sudden heat coursing through my stomach as Seth continued to rub in circles, going higher because I failed to stop him. I cleared my throat and paused, briefly closing my eyes as he got closer to my inner thigh. ""I-I didn't know that,"" I whispered, wishing I could take a huge gulp of water.



""Really?"" he asked with surprise. ""No wonder you let me touch you so casually.""



This was casual? Good lord! Now I want to know what un-casual is... I trembled with anticipation. I was being flayed alive and it was Seth's ever creeping hand doing it. My thighs slapped together, holding him still.



And it was no wonder I'd always felt regret when he stopped touching me on those 'casual' touching days. He had been trying to arouse me on purpose or at least cop a feel. I meant to let that accusation known, but the words stayed wedged in my thoughts.



""I just thought I was in a lucky situation where my boyfriend didn't care when I felt up his female best friend who, surprisingly, also didn't care. I lost my virginity to a female, just so we're all clear.""



""I knew this, but where are you going with it?"" Ethan asked. I felt him shift beside me, but couldn't bring myself to open my eyes wide enough to see what caused the movement.



How could anyone's brain function at a time like this anyhow? I let out an unintentional whimper as his fingertips wiggled through my clamped thighs and slipped underneath the material of my shorts.



""I'll let this happen, but only if I'm there. In fact, I want to be involved, but seeing as it's your first time and all, Cass, I would understand if you just wanted it to be Ethan,"" Seth said with a raspy voice.



Ethan released a breath I hadn't realized he'd been holding. My eyes popped open and I lifted my heavy-lidded gaze up to his flushed face. ""What?"" he asked.



He had to have known it was going this way! Seth must've said that for Ethan's benefit.



""What would be really hot is if while he popped your cherry I could fuck him from behind,"" Seth said in a partial joking tone. He pushed off the floor to sit on my other side, the side Ethan wasn't occupying.



My heart fluttered. I swallowed, wiggling between them both as chills ran through me. He was just as close now, almost plastered to my back and Ethan to my front, and I knew I would die from sensation overload. My skin was prickling with every breath, every shifting body part against me. I was far too sensitive and my dreams had nothing on the reality. If I died now I could consider myself almost lucky.



""Well, Cass? Would you mind?"" Seth asked.



My reaction was slightly sluggish given the situation I found myself in, but since it had been something I'd thought about before it didn't take much longer to respond, ""Didn't I make it clear already? Of course, I don't mind!""

 

I struggled with Ethan's front door as I juggled two iced coffees, a box of cupcake muffin hybrids, and my 'seen-better-days' imitation Coach purse. An eight-hour shift from hell, courtesy of The Coffee Barn, and that mighty doorknob was two seconds away from taking me out.



""Pft. I might just let it,"" I mumbled before giving in and tapping my aching foot against the door.



It swung open instantly, and there stood Seth, the fit model with permanently bronzed skin, thanks to his Italian and Greek heritage, cerulean blue 'fuck-me' bedroom eyes, and medium length hair so black it almost had a blue sheen. He wore a pristine white polo shirt, barely hiding the tribal art tattoo that curled at the base of his throat, and light gray sweats. Draw-string sweat pants were his go-to when he wasn't in public.



I swallowed and offered him a timid smile. ""Hey. I got you an iced coffee,"" I said, holding the cups out to him.



Seth took them but didn't say anything, which was unusual. Whether it was teasing me mercilessly, making gutter worthy jokes, telling stories about his Mafia involved family, or snarky remarks at something stupid I'd said he always had something to say.



So when his silence continued and his head tilted to the side as he eyed me I knew Ethan had already told him what I wanted. I bit my bottom lip at the realization, pausing as I noticed Seth's eyes zoning in on the movement. My heart fluttered and I could feel the heat filling my cheeks. It was fairly cold outside, so my cheeks were already chapped and probably pink, but where my apartment was on the wrong side of town and lacked everything, Ethan's was the exact opposite. So the heating in the building had already started bringing my body to a normal temperature and I wasn't so sure I'd be able to hide my blush for much longer.



""He told you?""



Seth neither confirmed nor denied it, but his lingering gaze down the front of my body told me the truth. I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly as I stepped inside, trying not to bump into his front as he stood immobile in the same spot. I shucked my shoes off, careful the movement didn't upset the contents in the box I held, and wiggled out of my red plaid fleeced jacket I'd found for practically free at a local Goodwill.



""What's in the box?"" he asked, stepping closer towards me.



I glanced up warily and turned my body away from him so I could hide my treasure. ""It's not for you. You and Ethan got an iced coffee.""



""Okay, but what is it?"" His hand darted out to try and grab it from me, forcing his chest closer to my face so that I got a whiff of pine and sandalwood. One of these days I planned on smuggling his and Ethan's cologne so I could spray my lumpy bed pillows with it. Where Seth smelled like spice, Ethan smelled like sugar, well specifically honeysuckle and fresh cotton, which to me was the equivalent of sugar. It was one other way they offset each other so well.



Resisting the urge to bury my nose in him, I danced out of his reach and held the green box to my chest, desperately trying to keep the gold-dusted chocolate ganache on my hybrid cupcake muffins from pressing into the top of the clear film.



""I'm not sharing with you!""



He paused and glanced down at me. When I'd first met Seth, about three years ago, I'd been intimidated by him, mostly due to his height, numerous tattoos, and strange scars that littered his torso. He easily was half a foot taller than Ethan and Ethan was just passing six feet. There I was, Miss Short Stuff, at a solid five four. I got over it, but now, with him towering over me, I remembered my hesitance at that first meeting.



""But you expect me to share with you?""



My mouth dropped open and I stilled. I knew Seth would eventually plow into the topic. It was just his way, but I hadn't expected it to be over my dessert. ""That's different!"" I cried out.



The corner of his mouth curled upwards into a smirk. ""Is it now? Care to enlighten me then.""



I frowned and bit my lip as I thought about it. ""Well—""



He raised a black eyebrow and folded his arms across his wide chest. ""Yes?""



""You're not the only one that has to share in that instance.""



""Oh,"" he managed around a chuckle. ""Okay."" He stepped away from me and made a wide gesture with both of his hands towards the living room.



I lifted my head, squared my shoulders, and pushed my chest out. My show of defiance only made him laugh harder. I was used to this type of ribbing from him. He was always trying to take my food, something he thinks is just so hilarious because I react to it, but he didn't know the reason behind my actions. It wasn't the first foster home I'd been in where they treated the kids like trash. I had plenty of instances after my biological parents died in that crash, but it was only after my adopted parents --both of whom I thoroughly adored--bit the bullet, and before Ethan's parents could legally swoop in and save me, that I experienced what true, gut gnawing, hunger felt like. That foster 'hell' thought it was okay to feed the children as sparingly as possible.



Sobering thoughts could bite my ass. I was truly tired of them creeping into my daily life activities and a marathon of sex might just fix that problem. I bit the inside of my cheek to keep from grinning like a loon as I took closer steps to the living room, but Seth's hands wrapped around my upper arms, pulling my back against his chest. He leaned down closer, so close I could feel his coffee-scented breath ruffling my hair and caressing the auricle of my ear.



""Are you sure you want to do this, Cassie?"" His whispered words made me shiver as I watched the back of Ethan's head bob enthusiastically as he played some 'shoot-em-up' game on his game console. I settled into his chest, letting my eyes shut briefly at the contact of his muscular pectorals against me.

 

**Chapter 3: Losing his girl virginity**

Saying I'd merely thought about having a threesome with my two best friends was the biggest understatement of the millennia. Mainly, it was Ethan and Seth as the leads, where I would make a cameo, but a starring role I'd never even dreamed of. Well, actually I had, many, many times. I just didn't think it could be a reality.



My mind's blown!



As the idea settled, my hands drifted in front of me, resting on my stomach while the subtle head of a raging bull slipped through me; as subtle as a raging bull could be at least. A caged monster trying to break free from my shorts caused me to push my palms into my lower abdomen. The intense jolt of pleasure caused a surprised grunt to escape my lips and my hips rolled like an instant reflex to relieve the pressure. I knew they both noticed my reaction when the silence continued and all I could hear was my staccato breathing as I tried, but failed, to remove my hands.



""That was fucking hot,"" Seth said breathlessly. ""It doesn't take much to turn you on, does it?""



He moved suddenly, and I felt the flat palms of his hands under my ass, lifting me, pushing me towards Ethan. I yelped as the movement forced me to straddle Ethan's lap and the suddenness of having him between my thighs caused me to wiggle against him. My hands rested against his chest, my head bowed, and my breathlessness left me lightheaded. I couldn't' believe the fast pace of the situation either. One minute we were talking about it, the next minute we were doing it.



My body was right on topic, by my mind needed to catch up.



The couch dipped as Seth scooted closer, and Ethan's hands clamped on my waist, stopping a second hip swivel. ""Under normal circumstances, I would have felt like I was being molested.""



""Oh come on, dude! You had no reaction to that?"" Seth asked gesturing towards his own lap. ""I'm half hard.""



I flushed, trying to calm myself through my yoga breathing techniques. Clearly, this was having more of an impact on Seth and me than it was on Ethan.



No biggie, Cass, you expected this. Right?



""I'm sorry,"" I said and tried to get off of his lap only to be stopped by Seth's hand on my lower back, keeping me still.



Seth pushed against me, his chest tight against my back as he swiftly captured Ethan's mouth in a rough, passion-filled kiss over my shoulder. With every tongue slash for dominance, Ethan leaned forward into me trying to get closer to Seth, but Seth pulled away enough to whisper in Ethan's ear. Whatever he said did enough to cause Ethan to react and shift beneath me. I was sitting on the rising evidence.



Heat pooled in my stomach, and I closed my eyes, but Ethan's deep, rough groan startled me. I turned my head to see Seth pop Ethan's earlobe out of his mouth. Ethan's hands lifted and rested against my sides, clutching tightly. Perhaps if the blood rushing in my own ears hadn't been so loud I'd have been able to hear them, after all, we were close enough.



""What did you say to him?"" I asked, watching as Ethan tried to catch his breath, his fingers digging almost painfully into my sides.



""I'll tell you after he takes your virginity,"" he said to me. ""I'll do what I promised, Ethan... to both of you. How about we do this now?""



Hello! I'm on top of Ethan. Aren't we already? Was what I thought to myself, but out loud I could only emit a noncommittal whimper of confirmation.



""Just like that? It seems like this is happening a little too quickly. Cassie..."" Ethan started sounding out of breath before he trailed off.



""I wouldn't have asked you if I wasn't sure. I was okay with it when it was just an idea. I'm okay with it now. The only hurdle is you,"" I managed with surprising clarity.



Ethan swallowed and took a shaky breath. ""So the three of us?""



I paused, letting it sink in what I was really asking for. I looked over at Seth, turning my head to the side as I examined him. ""Yeah, the three of us,"" I mumbled, and in an attempt to lighten the mood added, ""Plus, it seems only appropriate that you'll be losing your girl virginity to me.""



""My girl virginity?"" Ethan gave a breathless chuckle while continuing to hold my hips firmly against him.



""You've never been with a girl. So you have girl virginity.""



Seth snorted and smiled with his eyes. A few more jokes and the tension in the room dissipated. However, five minutes later when we all moved to Ethan's floor, 'awkward' reared its ugly head. Ethan tried to settle his body on top of mine but only successfully managed to dig his elbow into my ticklish stomach, and my shorts were climbing up my ass with my back flush against the shaggy, white carpet.



Uncomfortable!



Seth, the one who suggested our current position, was sitting on the couch above us, thoroughly amused at Ethan's uncertainty, and watching intently with his chin in his hands.



Why does Seth get to stay comfortable?



Ethan pulled back, removing his elbow from my belly, scowling as he settled his weight on his knees. He reached forward to grip my thighs, trying to push them apart so he could rest against me. This started a completely new bout of laughter as the feel of his fingers digging into my flesh tickled more.



""Would you stop?"" Ethan asked with exasperation.



I had a feeling his flustered expression had nothing to do with being turned on. Awkward is what it was. While I was more prone to laughing with his extremities digging into my sides, the situation alone was enough to get me going again. Ethan didn't help either. He would've seen it too if he wasn't being so uptight. I couldn't let this go without some form of comic relief if only to relieve the rapid beating of my own heart every time he touched me.



""Oh, mm, right there, baby."" I managed a fake moan before a snort of laughter escaped.



Seth chuckled and Ethan scowled. Not the result I'd been wanting, but it would do. I quickly turned my head to the side, my cheek pressing into the carpet as I gasped for breath between laughter and the occasional cough.



""Well, I'm glad you two find this amusing,"" Ethan said, sounding miffed.



""Cassie,"" Seth mumbled, his tone reprimanding, but amused all-at-once as he shook his head. He made a quick gesture toward Ethan. ""Ethan, take your shirt off, show her those rock hard abs. Maybe she'll get more serious.""



I instantly sobered. Ooh. Good idea!



Ethan pulled back, steadying himself on his knees, his hands placed at his hips. ""If I'm taking my shirt off so are you,"" he said with a pout.



Whoa! Two for one. Hooray!



""Yeah Seth, take it all off!"" I giggled and lifted my gaze towards him. ""Don't be shy.""



""Actually, Cassie, I was talking about you,"" Ethan said.



""I-"" I started. ""Oh, fine. I see how you are,"" I teased, smirking up at the both of them. ""Seth still has to take his shirt off though. Ethan, you have to be turned on for this to work, right? Now, strip... the both of you!"" I clucked my tongue and crinkled my nose into a scowl to rival all scowls when neither of them moved. ""Well?""



""I wanted to wait. See how Ethan responded to you without me, but fuckin-a if that wasn't a hot little speech,"" Seth said and whipped his shirt off his head rumpling his perfect black hair before throwing it at my face.



His warmth clung to the gray material, smelling like laundry soap and burnt charcoal from the chicken he'd cooked on the grill. I balled the shirt up and threw it back. He dodged it with cat-like reflexes and shot me an eat-shit grin. I made a tsking noise and sat up, bringing my face and upper body closer to Ethan's. His eyes widened, but he didn't move. ""Maybe I should try first though.""



""Try what?"" Ethan asked.



Yes what, Cassie? My thoughts were mean to me, but I barely knew what I meant either.



""To-um- to turn you on, Ethan."" I paused but clung to that idea. ""Don't I need to know how to turn you on by myself? You know, for practice?"" Really I just wanted an excuse to start touching him.



Ethan chuckled and nervously rubbed the back of his neck. ""Well, hopefully, the next guy you're with won't be gay and you won't have to try so hard.""



""How very encouraging,"" I said drolly and rolled my eyes. I shifted, scooting away from him, and folded my arms across my chest. ""Tell me what to do.""



Ethan raised an eyebrow. ""Uh,"" was all he managed before turning to look at Seth.



""Don't look at me,"" Seth said, holding his hands up. ""This is gonna be hot as hell.""



""Voyeur,"" I mumbled accusingly.

1ljjqy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryjujuarmy/comments/1ljjqy3/we_found_a_secret_underground_german_facility_in/,"We found a secret underground German facility in the Black Forest, what was in there scared me for life","I am Liam Smith. I’m a 27-year-old American from Miami, Florida, who enlisted in the US Army in 1942. During the time I was a soldier, I had witnessed how the Allies had landed on the beaches of Normandy during D-Day, how we had pushed the Germans out of France and even the Battle of the Bulge. Now we were pushing deeper into the heart of Germany itself. In the northern parts of the Western Front, the Allies had broken through the Rhine defenses and since the Germans defenses in the southern parts near the Rhine seemed scarce, it would only be a matter of time before we would march further.

Through everything I endured, I always found comfort with my 4 closest comrades – Jacob Steinberg, A Jewish American from Indianapolis, the macho figure Henry Robinson from Detroit, the shy photographer Drew Scott from New York and the Afro-American military engineer Tod Jackson from New Orleans. From those 4, I was closest with Jacob, who’s ready to take on anything. Due to the fact that he understands German, he’s useful when translating captured German documents for us. Tod was the most recent in our squad, since he transferred from another regiment due to the sheer harassment he got for being Afro-American. Although in our regiment some whites do whisper things about him, it is in Tod’s eyes nothing compared to what he underwent in his previous regiment.

Then there are my superiors. First there’s commander Miller, a veteran from World War I. He’s known for his brilliant tactics against the enemy, but he never takes up a gun and fight side by side with his soldiers. No one blames him, though. I mean, he’s too valuable to lose and also because he was already 60 years old. Then there’s lieutenant Joseph Wilson, a father figure to the squad, willing to risk his own life for the sake of his men. We are all very loyal to him. And then there’s sergeant Ben Allen, a cold figure who would scowl his men for the slightest mistakes. Sergeant Allan is disliked by every soldier of the squad and even commander Miller ordered Wilson to watch Allan’s every move or actions.

It was April 21, 1945. It had been raining for days, turning the dirt roads of the German countryside into endless trails of mud. Trees stood like ancient sentinels along our route, their branches reaching over us like skeletal arms. We had pushed through village after village, some abandoned, others holding pockets of resistance too weak to stand for long. It was clear to all of us the war was drawing to a close. Hitler was cornered in Berlin, and the Wehrmacht and SS have lost their bite. But even a dying beast can lash out one last time.

We were sheltering in a German farmhouse just outside the Black Forest. Night was falling and a low mist curled around the treetops in the distance. Our squad had taken some much-needed rest, sprawled out on makeshift cots or writing letters home by the flickering lanterns. I sat by a cracked window with Jacob, listening to the distant thunder. The air smelled like wet leaves and burnt oil.

“You think they’ll surrender soon?” I asked, shifting my rifle off my shoulder and resting it against the wall.

Jacob shrugged. “They have to. They got nothin’ left but scraps and fanatics.” He ran a hand through his brown hair and took out his cigarette lighter. He didn’t light anything. Just flicked it open and closed in a steady rhythm.

“Then what the hell are they still doing in the Black Forest?” Henry grunted from behind. He had been polishing his gun. “Damn Krauts should know it’s over.”

“Maybe they’re hiding something,” Drew piped in from his corner, adjusting the lens on his camera. He was the quietest of us, always watching, always recording. “The SS never really played by the rules, did they?”

Tod snorted softly, fiddling with a busted field radio. “If they are, they’re doing a hell of a job keeping it to themselves.”

“Jackson!” came a sharp bark of Sergeant Allen.

Tod stood at attention, snapping a salute. “Yes, Sir!”

“I want that radio working before we head out tomorrow. If you screw up like last time, I’ll have you running laps through the mud until your boots melt.”

“Understood, Sir.” Tod replied in a serious tone.

Allen’s eyes narrowed, then stomped off to the adjoining room. His bootsteps echoed like gunshots. The man had a face like cracked concrete and a personality to match.

“Guy’s a walking ulcer,” Henry muttered under his breath.

“Yeah, well, he’s not wrong about the radio,” I said. “We might need that if anything goes wrong in those woods.”

Lieutenant Wilson entered not long after, his uniform somehow still crisp despite the weather. His presence changed the air in the room. Much softer and warmer.

“Evening, men,” he greeted us with a nod. “Commander Miller has briefed me on a possible objective in the Black Forest. You all are going in tomorrow morning. We’ll advance quietly. No fireworks unless necessary.”

Jacob looked up. “Any intel on what we might find, Sir?”

Wilson shook his head slowly. “Only rumors. High command thinks it might be a last-ditch weapons depot or SS communications hub. Whatever it is, it’s hidden.”

“Hidden,” Henry repeated, “That never means anything good.”

Wilson offered a rare smile. “That’s why I’m sending the best men I’ve got. Don’t make me regret it, Robinson.”

Henry grinned. “Wouldn’t dream of it, Sir.”

Wilson turned to me. “Smith, you’ll take point. You’ve got the best sense of direction in this squad. Keep them steady.”

“Yes, sir,” I said.

That night, none of us slept very well. The rain drummed against the roof, and the forest loomed outside like a dark wound in the earth. Something about it made my stomach twist, but I kept that to myself. We were soldiers. We had seen worse.

Or that’s what we believed.

April 22, 1945 – 03:15 AM

We began our march on 3:15 AM. The mist clung to the ground like a shroud, and the forest seemed to swallow all sound. We moved in tight formation, 25 men in total. I led with Jacob, Henry, Drew, and Tod at my side. Our boots squelched through the wet earth.

“It’s too damn quiet,” Drew whispered.

“No kidding,” Tod replied. “Where the hell are the patrols?”

“Gone,” Jacob murmured. “Or hiding.”

“Or dead,” Henry added grimly.

By 5:30 AM, we reached the base of a hill that rose like a tumor from the earth, covered in thick pines and jagged rock. As we rounded the slope, I caught a glimpse of something metallic.

“Hold up,” I whispered.

We crept forward, rifles raised. There, embedded in the hillside, was a massive steel door. It looked only a few years old and was pretty much intact. Painted on it in the middle, was a large, black swastika.

“Sweet Jesus,” Drew breathed.

Wilson stepped forward, radio crackling. “Commander Miller, this is Lieutenant Wilson. We’ve found a steel door embedded in the western ridge. It’s marked with a swastika. Requesting permission to enter.”

There was a pause, and then the man’s voice came through, rough as gravel.

“Proceed, Wilson. But be careful. God only knows what those bastards built in there.

We opened the door with crowbars and raw muscle. It slid with a moan that echoed into the void beyond. A pitch-black hallway stretched inward. Our flashlights pierced the dark, revealing smooth steel, industrial walls.

“Everyone, stay alert,” Wilson ordered, his voice barely more than a whisper.

We filed inside slowly, our boots clinking on the concrete as we swept our flashlights across the dark corridor ahead.

“I feel like we’re walking into a goddamn grave,” Henry muttered, holding his gun up, his finger close to the trigger.

“You got that right,” I said in a low voice. “Why would they hide something *this* far in?

Drew chimed in from behind. “Feels like we’re going into a tomb...”

“It *is* a tomb,” Jacob added solemnly, pointing to the warning sign painted in German just above the entry point. “**Zutritt verboten. Eigentum der SS-Okkultabteilung.**”

“What the hell does that mean?” Tod asked.

“It means: ‘No entry. Property of the SS Occult Division.’” Jacob replied.

We stopped.

Wilson turned to Jacob, raising an eyebrow. “Are you serious, Steinberg?”

Jacob nodded grimly. “Dead serious, Sir.”

We continued deeper.

Soon we found a generator room, a small concrete cubicle with a rusting old diesel generator.

“Jacob, Tod, look,” I pointed to the generator.

Jacob and Tod managed to kick it on after some fumbling, flooding the hallway with dim yellow bulbs. They flickered like candlelight in a crypt, but at least we didn’t have to use our flashlights anymore.

“Well, that helps,” Henry muttered. “That saves us batteries of our flashlights.”

That’s when we saw how empty the place was, *too* empty.

There were no bodies. No signs of a struggle. But the lab equipment – rows of steel tables, racks of vials, chemical burners, German typewriters, even opened briefcases full of documents – was still there.

It was like every German in the facility, scientist or guard, had vanished in the middle of the workday. Like they had *run*.

Henry tapped on one of the cabinets, glancing inside. “Why would they leave everything behind like this? The Krauts are usually meticulous.”

Jacob leafed through one of the folders, squinting at the Gothic script. “They were making nerve agents. Some of this… this isn’t conventional stuff. Looks like… psychological weapons too. Hallucinogens. Shit, that targets the mind. It says: **Projekt Schattenherz**.”

“Schatten… Heart?” Drew asked, peering over.

“No, **Shadow Heart**. That’s a loose translation. Could mean Black Core, or Core of Darkness, depending on context. There’s something about merging ancient rituals with modern science.” Jacob replied.

“Don’t like the sound of that,” Tod muttered.

Then we reached it – a big room with the Nazi banner hanging on a wall.

Red, massive, with the black swastika stitched into its center like the eye of some unblinking god.

Jacob stepped forward, his jaw tight. He reached into his pocket, pulling out the lighter he always used for his cigarettes. He lit it and held the flame to the bottom corner of the banner.

It caught quickly, curling and blackening like dried skin. Ash fell to the floor, and the swastika crumpled in on itself.

That’s when we saw it.

The banner had been hiding another steel door. This one was thicker, older, no hinges, no handle, just a big circular seal burned into the center like some ancient glyph.

I’ll never forget the symbol.

“God…” Jacob muttered to himself.

There was a large black circle in the center, ringed with three concentric circles and twelve angular lines forming a radiant wheel. SS-runes flanked each side, and above it sat the death’s head insignia.

“Black sun…” Jacob said, almost in a whisper. “I heard about it of a dossier from the captured castle of Wewelsburg, Heinrich Himmler’s castle, where the same black symbol is inlaid on one of its floors. This… this is bad.”

Henry scoffed. “So? It’s just another Nazi symbol.”

“No,” Jacob said, firmer now. “This isn’t just a symbol. It’s… a *seal*.”

“A seal for what?” I asked.

Jacob didn’t answer. He didn’t have to.

We called Wilson and Allan. They came quickly, their boots slamming against the floor.

“Allan,” Wilson said, “secure the perimeter. Steinberg – what is this?”

“It seems like a secret door, Sir. We saw it after I had burned the Nazi banner that was covering it.”

“How do we open it?” Wilson asked.

Jacob shrugged his shoulders. The door had no visible locks, no keyhole. Just the symbol.

But Tod studied the seam along the wall, tapping the metal with a small tool, ears listening carefully. “There’s a mechanical relay here. If I can hotwire the circuit, I might be able to force it.”

“Are you sure that’s wise, Jackson?” Wilson asked.

Tod stared at him. “Sir… nothing about this place is wise.”

He got to work. Sparks flew from Tod’s toolkit as he connected wires, shorted contacts, and twisted nodes. The door let out a horrible *clunk*, like a tomb being unsealed.

And slowly… it began to slide open. Behind it, nothing but darkness.

A long staircase descended into a dark void, the concrete steps slick with condensation, or maybe something else.

Eventually, we reached the end of the staircase and saw that were was a long dark hallway in front of us.

“Jesus,” Drew whispered, lifting his camera. He snapped a photo. The flash briefly illuminated a sign painted on the inner wall:

**LABO S**

**Nur für autorisierte SS-Wissenschaftler**

**“Nur das Blut kann uns retten.”**

“What does it say, Jacob?” Drew asked.

“It says: ‘LABO S, For authorized SS scientists only’ and… ‘Only blood can save us.’ Jacob replied.

An uneasy feeling crept across my spine when Jacob said those words.

Eventually, Wilson gave the order.

“Everyone, we proceed carefully. Steinberg, Scott, Smith, Robinson, Jackson, Allan, you’re with me. The rest of the squad will follow, split down the branching corridors.”

As we stepped into that hellish descent, I felt the darkness close in around us like a coffin.

The air grew thick and humid, smelled of rust, rot, and something far fouler…

Even Allan, ever the unflinching bastard, hesitated.

“You guys feel that?” Tod whispered.

“Yeah,” I answered, sweat starting to bead on my neck. “It’s like we’re not alone.”

We reached the base after 5 minutes. A large open antechamber greeted us. Walls lined with crude oil paintings of runes, blood-red streaks, and statues – some human-shaped, others less so.

We flashed our lights on the map fixed to the wall.

It was a diagram of the facility.

Jacob exhaled sharply. “God…”

“Spit it out, Steinberg,” Allan barked quietly.

“It’s a maze. It stretches… my God, miles underground.”

“Why the hell would they build something so big?” Henry asked, voice low.

“They weren’t just hiding from bombs,” I muttered. “They were hiding something else in here.”

Eventually, Wilson ordered the squad to split up and navigate through the facility, but they must always keep their guard up.

Sergeant Allan, and us five – I, Jacob, Drew, Henry, and Tod – took the right corridor.

The beam of my flashlight cut through the heavy gloom in thin slices, revealing cold concrete walls covered in condensation. The place stank of mildew, rust, and something beneath it… a coppery, organic undertone that sat heavy in the back of my throat. The air was thick and unmoving. It didn’t just smell stale, it felt dead.

Tod walked ahead of me, his flashlight held low, illuminating the ground. Henry was to my left, always a few paces ahead, rifle raised and ready, his usual cocky strut subdued. Drew lingered behind us, nervously glancing at every shadow that flickered along the walls. Jacob, quiet as ever, held his flashlight close to his chest, the trembling light betraying the tension in his fingers. Sergeant Allen brought up the rear. He said nothing, his face a cold mask, but even he was alert in a way that told me this place had unsettled him too.

The hallway was narrow, the concrete walls etched with the signs of rushed construction: scratch marks, tool gouges, even fingernail scrapes in places, like someone had once been dragged.

Our boots echoed faintly on the floor, yet somehow it felt like the sounds were swallowed up almost immediately, devoured by the silence.

We passed storage rooms and side chambers – each one empty, abandoned, filled with cobwebs and dust-covered crates. Some crates had been smashed open, their contents – glass vials, syringes, rusted surgical tools – scattered across the floors like the remnants of a hurried escape or… something more violent.

There was a red smear on one of the walls at shoulder height. It wasn’t paint. We didn’t say anything about it. We just kept moving, each man knowing better than to speculate aloud what the hell might’ve caused it.

After about 15 minutes of silent advance, we came upon the first sign of death.

Tod froze mid-step and raised his hand. We stopped instantly. His flashlight beam held steady on a shape sprawled across the corridor just ahead – at first a mess of black fabric and grey flesh.

We approached slowly, weapons raised. I reached it first and crouched. What remained on the ground had once been a man, an SS guard. But whatever had killed him hadn’t just killed him. It had torn through him like a wild animal. His chest cavity was open, ribs snapped and jutting outward like broken branches. His face was frozen in a scream, jaw torn at an unnatural angle. One of his eyes was missing. The other stared directly at me.

“Jesus,” Henry muttered, covering his mouth. “What the hell did that?”

“No bomb did this,” Tod said quietly, crouching beside me. “This ain’t shrapnel or bullets.”

Animals?” Drew asked, voice barely above a whisper.

“Underground?” I replied. “No. This is something else.”

But as we stepped further, more bodies followed.

Down the corridor, the walls became darker. Streaks of dried blood painted long vertical lines. We found three more SS guards – each one worse than the last.

One had his arms pulled clean off, the tendons still hanging. Another had his throat ripped so deeply that his head was barely hanging on. The last was just a torso, severed midsection, with his spine torn clean out and trailing behind like a grotesque tail.

Sergeant Allen broke the silence. “Keep moving. Eyes up.”

We obeyed. Nobody argued, not even Henry. There was no room for ego here, not anymore. Whatever did this, it didn’t kill out of necessity. It killed with purpose.

The deeper we went, the more it felt like the very walls were watching us. I started to hear things. Soft taps, like nails on steel. Once or twice, I thought I saw movement in the distance, flickers of something just out of the range of my flashlight. My breath came out in puffs, even though the air was damp and warm. I was sweating, but my body felt cold.

It was Jacob who voiced what we all thought

“This isn’t war,” he said, “This is something else.”

He was right.

We hadn’t stumbled into an abandoned lab or some last-ditch Nazi bunker. No. We had walked straight into something buried for a reason. Hidden not just from the Allies, but maybe even from the Nazis themselves.

Whatever had happened here, it had gone fatally wrong. And something told me we hadn’t seen the worst of it yet.

The corridor split ahead, branching off into a wide section where doors lined both sides like sealed tombs. They were thick, metal-plated things, most of them shut tight. Each bore a stenciled number and the same insignia: a black sun, overlaid with an angular rune I didn’t recognize. A crude marriage of science and mysticism. It made my skin crawl.

The first door we came to was marked **Labo E-4**. Henry tried the handle. It gave after a few tugs, opening inward with a soft hiss as the seal broke. What we found inside stopped us cold.

The room was a sterile white that had yellowed with time and decay. Rust spread across the corners of the walls like creeping mold. In the center of the room stood an operating table under a rusted surgical light.

Chains hung from the ceiling ending in thick manacles crusted in dried blood. The table wasn’t empty. Something skeletal and vaguely human still lay strapped there.

It had no eyes. No skin. Most of its lower body was missing, yet the ribcage was unnaturally wide, as if something had tried to grow outward from inside.

Tubes had been inserted into the remains. I could almost swear it was moving, but when I blinked, it was still.

Jacob spoke.

“That’s not… anatomy,” he murmured. “Human anatomy doesn’t look like that.”

We didn’t linger. One room was horror enough. But there were more.

In **Labo E-5**, we found a wall covered with photos pinned in neat rows. Each photo depicting a different stage of what could only be described as ritual surgery. Men, women, even children lay on gurneys with symbols carved into their flesh.  Some had their skulls partially removed, exposing their brains while they were still alive, based on the annotations written in German across the photos.

Drew turned away and vomited heavily. I couldn’t blame him. Even sergeant Allen looked paler than usual.

The shelves in that room were stocked with glass jars. Inside floated twisted, malformed specimens – organs with too many chambers, a three-eyed fetus, a shriveled head with no mouth but two twitching, gray eyelids.

On the far wall, diagrams were drawn on a blackboard in chalk. Not anatomical diagrams, but arcane ones. Circles, lines intersected with runes and numbers. Pentagrams overlaid with mathematical equations. Something bridging the gap between rituals and science.

“This… this is theology and thermodynamics smashed together,” Jacob muttered as he examined them. “This isn’t just Nazi science. This is occult engineering.”

In **Labo E-7**, we found a pit. The room was larger than the others, dimly lit by the flicker of half-functioning emergency lights.  In the center, a square hatch had been left open, leading into a deep concrete shaft. Around it were strange restraints built into the floor, which were meant to hold something large.

On the walls were markings burned into the concrete itself, charred and black. Symbols, words in Latin, runes and what looked like Enochian script.

Henry leaned over the pit, shining his flashlight down.

“God,” he whispered. “There are scratches on the inside. Like something tried to climb out.”

I didn’t want to look but I did anyway.

He was right. Claw marks. Dozens of them, some deep enough to crack stone. I didn’t see the bottom. It felt more like a throat than a shaft. Like the bunker itself had swallowed something whole.

We moved on, chamber after chamber.

**Labo E-9** had bookshelves – rows of them, filled with handbound volumes in leather covers that looked suspiciously like skin. Most were written in Latin, but a few were unrecognizable symbols that shimmered faintly when the flashlight passed over them.

On one table lay a dissected corpse mid-autopsy, with detailed notes on the table beside it. I picked them up. The handwriting was clean. The words described something born without a soul, engineered to host something else – *ein Gefäß*.

“What does ‘ein Gefäß’ mean, Jacob?” I asked.

“A vessel,” Jacob replied, “And I believe… a human vessel.”

“It doesn’t make any sense,” Drew whispered behind me. “How the hell did they get this far underground? This is more than just war. This is… a whole belief system.”

Jacob didn’t respond to Drew. He was scanning the symbols on the walls with an intensity I didn’t like.

We kept going. **Labo E-11**. **Labo E-13**. Each more grotesque than the last. One was filled with audio reels and tape machines. Jacob played one briefly. A woman screaming, over and over, in perfect rhythm. Then silence. Then chanting – deep, guttural and inhuman.

In another, we found cots and beds for the scientists who worked here. Some had been torn apart from the inside. Blood on the walls spelled something in jagged German: “It still lives.”

No one said a word after that. We just moved. Quieter. Slower.

By the time we reached the far end of the corridor, the rooms had stopped being labeled with numbers. Just symbols now. Scrawled in charcoal, burned into the metal. There was one final door, larger than the rest. Reinforced. The kind of door used to seal something in… or out.

Jacob stepped forward. “This is where the experiments ended,” he said. “Or began.”

Tod looked at him sharply. “What do you mean?”

He didn’t answer. Instead, he pressed a hand against the door, as if feeling for something beyond.

Allen checked his weapon. “We’re going in.”

None of us were ready for what waited beyond. But we opened it anyway.

The final door groaned as it opened. Beyond it was not just another room… it was a hall. The ceiling vaulted high overhead, lost in darkness. Metal catwalks zigzagged above, and the air was thick with a smell like rotting copper and wet iron. The walls pulsed with a heat that didn’t come from machinery or light. It felt alive.

We entered cautiously, our weapons raised. The lights here flickered more steadily than elsewhere. Somehow, this part of Labo S had retained power. Spotlights embedded in the ceiling illuminated specific stations: workbenches, ritual circles, medical operating areas, and glass tanks along the far wall filled with murky fluid.

In the center stood a massive stone slab, surrounded by concentric circles carved into the floor – overlapping geometric designs, half occult, half mechanical. Runes wove through with strange technical annotations: symbols next to voltage values, sigils mapped to wave frequencies, runes paired with what looked like radio schematics.

And at the heart of it all, on a pedestal of bone-white marble, lay a black leather notebook.

Jacob was drawn to it immediately. He didn’t hesitate, picked it up, slowly peeled back the front cover, and began to read aloud. His voice was low, his brow furrowed and his eyes darting across the pages.

“It’s written by someone named Dr. Magnus Erhard Weiss. SS-Obersturmführer. Head occult-scientist of Division Ahnenerbe, **Einheit Schwarze Krone**, **Unit Black Crown**.” He swallowed. “It’s half diary, half formula compendium.”

We gathered around as he read the following out loud to us:

*“Our experiments in vibrational transfusion have surpassed the limitations of human biology. The host bodies respond best when laced with bronze and quartz matrices, with the runes etched directly into the nervous system allow for increased resonance with the lower frequencies. This is the key: the human soul must be severed and replaced with directional energy – artificial consciousness guided by ritual.”*

Jacob’s voice shook slightly and turned the page.

*“Subject 23 achieved partial synchronization. It remained alive after removal of all vital organs, save the brain and spinal stem. When placed inside the Third Seal, it spoke a word in a language none of us knew, and every light in the chamber died at once. That was the first time we realized we were dealing not with madness, but with contact.”*

I stared at Jacob and asked scared: “Contact with what?”

Jacob looked up. His face was pale.

*“It doesn’t name itself. It came when the Veil was torn through magneto-spiritual induction. Using blood as conductive medium, and sound as direction. It calls from beneath the skin of the world. It needs vessels. Blood amplifies the resonance.”*

He paused again. Then, more pages:

*“The final subject,* ***Götterträger Eins*** *(God-Carrier One), was prepared from conception. Born in darkness. Fed on ash and marrow. Carved with 88 runes before its first breath. We bound it in the ninth chamber. It opened its eyes, and we heard the choir through steel. Not voices. Screams in reverse.”*

No one spoke.

Jacob turned to the last few entries, his hands shaking.

*“The beast grows restless. No containment is holding. It speaks now in our dreams, infecting the scientists. One tried to open the door for it. We shot him. It laughed in our heads. It has no hunger for food. Only blood. Endless, violent blood. The more it drinks, the more it remembers. Its name is not meant for mouths. But it remembers now.”*

Jacob hesitated and turned to the last page. His eyes widened.

“It’s… written in a different hand,” he murmured. “The script is erratic. Like it was scrawled in panic.”

He read it slowly.

*“It’s out. We failed. The Black Crown is shattered. The blood calls to it. The beast, it can’t be killed. It feeds. It feeds endlessly. Please, if you find this, for the love of God…”*

Jacob stopped. He looked down at the very bottom of the page. His voice dropped to a whisper as he translated the final line, written in smeared German, still wet with flakes of dried blood:

**“LAUF. ES IST NOCH HIER.”**

“Run. It is still here.” Jacob muttered softly.

No one breathed.

Somewhere, deep in the corridor behind us, we heard some metallic shift. Then the faint, unmistakable sound of **wet footsteps**. Not shoes. Not boots. Bare. Heavy. As if whatever made them had more than two legs.

“Lights out. Weapons ready. No sound.” Allan said in a hoarse whisper.

We turned off our flashlights. The notebook stayed in Jacob’s hand.

In that moment, all we heard was breathing. Not human. Not animal. It was deep, thick with phlegm and fluid, gurgling faintly like air rising through blood. It echoed through the darkened corridor behind us.

Allan held up a fist, signaling silence. We crouched low, flashlights off, weapons aimed toward the doorway. The distant red emergency light above us blinked every few seconds, bathing the room in a hellish pulse.

In each flash, shadows twisted.

“Thermal,” whispered Henry, sliding his scope over one eye.

He stopped.

Then, he said quietly: “Nothing. It’s just cold.”

Jacob looked at him. “How can it be cold and breathing?”

That’s when the sound of breathing changed, it deepened, grew slower. Not a pattern of respiration, but mimicry. It had heard us breathing. It was trying to copy it.

A scraping sound echoed through the hall, like claws raking concrete. Then silence.

We waited. One minute. Two.

Then, **BOOM**.

The entire laboratory shook. The door we had come through slammed shut, by itself.

Allan spoke low and fast at the same time: “We’re not waiting to be picked off. We clear this lab and find another exit. Anything moves that’s not one of us, shoot.”

We moved. Swift and quiet through the vast chamber, stepping around shattered tanks, overturned ritual equipment, crushed steel scaffolding.

We passed a room with observation glass. It had been smashed from the inside. Inside it, a single operating chair stood bolted to the ground, torn restraints dangling from the armrests. Blood painted the walls in clawed swipes. Symbols carved into the floor glowed faintly, reacting to our presence – just barely, as if still alive, or remembering what had been done here.

“Smells like burnt teeth,” muttered Tod, covering his nose.

Jacob turned to him. “That’s ozone and calcium. When they fused the bone. It's what they used to anchor the soul to the host.”

Henry gave him a look. “You sound like you’re starting to believe this shit.”

Jacob didn’t respond. We moved further

Down one hallway, we saw signs in stenciled Gothic:

**Versuchssubjekte 1–12 (Test Subjects 1–12)**

**Schlafräume der Wirtträger (Dormitories of the Host Carriers)**

**Kammer IX: Göttlicher Einschluss (Chamber IX: Divine Containment)**

We stopped. That last sign was torn, warped. The paint looked like it had been smeared by a hand soaked in viscera. Underneath someone had carved in German: “It is not divine. It is hunger.”

“This place looks like it has been shut down for years now,” sergeant Allan whispered to himself, “How is there fresh blood on the walls?”

Then, the lights went out completely. Total darkness swallowed us.

Drew clicked on his flashlight. The beam landed on a wall, then swept across a stretch of corridor and froze.

Something had moved.

We saw a limb – no, a shape – disappear around a corner. Tall. Wrong. It had bent to fit the hallway ceiling. Its skin had looked wet, pale, and scarred with blackened sigils. No eyes, but a face. A long, lipless jaw. And something like horns or perhaps branches, fused to its skull.

“Did it… did it have ribs on the outside?” Henry muttered.

But we didn’t answer. We ran.

It followed. Not with the chaos of an animal. This thing stalked. It wanted us to move and split up. Jacob’s notebook pages fluttered as we fled through dark corridors. Behind us, we heard metal twist, doors groan, and then screams – faint, far away.

We turned into a narrower hallway, marked only by a number burned into the wall: **IX**. The Divine Containment Chamber.

It stood ahead: a vault-like circular door, three inches thick, torn open from within. The walls bore claw marks but not scratched – carved with purpose. Words. Sentences. All in Latin, German, even in symbols we couldn’t place.

At the center of the chamber was a black circle stained with a thick crust of dried blood. Chains hung from the ceiling, broken. Runes beneath them had been cracked – scratched out by something trapped inside.

We were standing in a cage.

Jacob raised the notebook again. “This is where it was born. This is where they fed it. Rituals involving the blood of political prisoners. Forced trauma resonance. Repetition of murder to increase the vessel’s saturation. Each death made it stronger. They wanted to create a living ark for something beyond understanding. A container for something older than myth.”

Tod’s voice was hoarse. “Is it still in here?”

Jacob turned a page.

“No,” he said. “*It doesn’t stay in any one place.* It moves through the lab. Through the runes… and blood.”

Something whispered. Not aloud. Inside us. Drew dropped to his knees, screaming and clutching his head. His eyes rolled back.

And in the air, we smelled rot. Flesh that had never known burial.

We aimed our weapons.

A shape loomed in the dark. **Tall. Silent. Watching.**

Then it moved.

The moment the shape moved was like the world itself shuddered.

It was impossibly tall, nearly touching the ceiling, but it didn’t walk. It glided, sliding over the cold concrete floor with a silence that gave a chill across my spine.

Its skin looked stretched tight over bones that twisted in unnatural angles, pale like dead wax, marked with dark sigils that pulsed faintly in the dim light. What I first thought were horns were more like branches, crooked and sharp, weaving out from its skull like a twisted crown.

Its face – if you can call it that – was a nightmarish void, a hollow with empty sockets, but somehow, I could feel it watching me.

I swallowed hard and steadied my gun. “Hold your fire… until it moves closer.”

But Henry’ didn’t wait. He fired a burst from his Thompson. The bullets tore through the creature’s side with a sickening wet crack, but it barely flinched. Instead, it turned toward him, and I swear, I saw a grin crack open the void where its mouth should have been. A sound like tearing cloth and something wet – and alive – came from it.

Drew screamed again, clutching his head, as if the creature’s presence was invading his mind. “Get it off me! Get it off me!” he cried, staggering back into the wall.

I grabbed him before he fell. “Drew! Snap out of it!”

Tod’s voice rang out. “It’s not just physical! This thing’s inside our heads!”

Allan barked orders, trying to keep us together, but the creature was relentless. It lunged at Allan, who barely dodged. The air smelled of sulfur and decay.

Jacob, shaking but focused, whispered, “It’s feeding off our fear. The rituals… the blood sacrifices were meant to awaken it, but they never controlled it. Now, *it hunts*.”

Suddenly, the creature’s shadow stretched across the room, swallowing the flickering lights. In that darkness, I heard it speak – not with words, but a voice echoing in my mind: *“You will become the sacrifice.”*

We opened fire together. Bullets tore through the air, but it was like trying to stop a storm with stones. The creature’s limbs twisted and bent as it dodged, closing in on Henry.  Before we could even react, the beast snapped Henry into its maw, or whatever it was.

In a flash of time, we all saw Henry’s body being snapped in 2, with his body parts falling on the concrete floor and blood spewing out of it.

Then, it charged at full speed at Tod. Just as it reached out, however, Tod shoved a makeshift charge from his pack into the creature’s side and triggered it. The explosion shattered the chamber. Flames licked the walls, smoke thick and acrid filling the air.

The creature screamed – a horrific, guttural sound like nails on a chalkboard mixed with the roar of a dying beast. It staggered, wounds smoking and seeping dark ichor. But it was far from dead.

Just then, we heard more gunshots from a left hall. It was Wilson firing at the creature’s empty eye sockets.

“Wilson!” yelled sergeant Allan. “Where’s the rest of the squad?!”

“Dead!” Wilson replied. “This creature took them all! Even my group got mauled by it after I investigated a chamber alone!”

The creature, however, was beginning to regain its composure and locked its gaze onto Willson.

Wilson loaded another magazine and fired directly into the creature’s face – into the void where eyes should have been. “Go! **NOW!**” he ordered.

We all did as he ordered us to. Me and Jacob dragged Drew, who was still screaming, whilst Tod led the way forward. Sergeant Allan looked behind towards his superior colleague as the creature closed in on Wilson.

Then, we heard a loud scream. The creature had Wilson into its maw, void, whatever it was.

“**GO!**” Wilson screamed one last time as he pulled out his dagger and stabbed the creature’s right eye sock with all his might.

We ran, and we heard the screaming of both Wilson and the beast echoing through the hallways of the maze.

I don’t know how long we ran through those hallways with the walls edged in messages, but we eventually made it back to the staircase we had descended earlier.

The creature hadn’t followed us, and we eventually made it back to the steel door with the Black sun on it. Wilson’s sacrifice had saved us. Well, only 5 of the entire squad…

When we got out of the facility as a whole, we entered the broad daylight. The sun was shining through the forest, and we could even hear birds sing happily. But that could not cheer us up from what we had just witnessed in that underground maze.

Later, we reported to commander Miller of what we had seen, the upper facility, the staircase that led to a more secretive one below, the rooms we had seen and most of all… the creature. Miller had a look of concern on his face when we told him, but due to the fact that 5 of us told the same thing, he believed us. Jacob even handed over the diary he had taken from the largest room and translated everything to Miller. Miller asked if Drew had somehow taken photos of the beast, but Drew was to struck by fear and shock, since he couldn’t get the voices out of his head from what the beast said earlier. Drew even had to be transferred to a field hospital to recover mentally.

It wasn’t long before the entire regiment heard about what had happened. They laughed at it and even said that we had gone mad in the first place. Especially Drew, who was screaming in his sleep, to the annoyance of other injured soldiers. Commander Miller did order that the inside of the facility had to be destroyed. It was only the first hallway that they had blown up but that was enough to make parts of the hill crumble and the stone rubble covering anything that was once an entrance.

When the war in Europe had ended, we were all given a medal for our heroic military actions. On September 7th, 1945, 5 days after the Japanese had capitulated, we were transferred from Europe back to the US via ship. Although all the men on board celebrated their victory, we kept ourselves confined in our cabin that we shared on the ship.

After I came back to the US, I returned to my home in Miami. I eventually moved to the state of South Dakota because of the new job I gained as a businessman. On my work, I met a woman named Lisa and before we knew it, we fell in love, got married and had two children named Elias in 1949 and Alice in 1951. Still, I sometimes had nightmares about what had happened back on April 22, 1945, in that cursed facility. But even that faded over the course of time.

It is April 22, 1975, and I was sipping my coffee as I read the newspaper. What I read on the 5th page shocked me to my core. The West German government found a document signed by Himmler in 1935, where he and Hitler agreed to build a secret underground occult research facility in the Black Forest. They were now removing the stone rubble, but the workers tell of how they somehow smell blood and that in their sleep… *they hear voices*.",1,1750791579.0,scaryjujuarmy,0,1.0,False

1ljjnqb,http://www.veepn.com,Why Every Social Media User Needs a VPN (And Why I Chose VeePN),"
I’ve been using social media for years, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Twitter and so on. But it wasn’t until recently that I started thinking more seriously about online privacy. We share a lot on these platforms, sometimes without even realizing it. Our personal data, locations, browsing habits... all of it can be tracked or even exposed if we’re not careful.

That’s when I decided to start using a VPN, and after trying a few, I landed on [VeePN](http://www.veepn.com). Honestly, I didn’t realize how much I needed one until I started using it.

First off, public WiFi is a huge risk, I use it all the time in coffee shops and airports, and without a VPN, anyone could snoop on what I'm doing. VeePN gives me peace of mind with strong AES 256-bit encryption and solid protocols like WireGuard and OpenVPN. My data stays encrypted and my IP is hidden, which is exactly what I want when I’m posting or scrolling through socials.

They also have a strict no logs policy, which was super important to me. I don’t want my activity tracked by ISPs, advertisers, or anyone else. With VeePN, none of that data is stored, not even connection timestamps or IP info.

One feature I really like is the Kill Switch. If the VPN ever drops for a second (hasn’t happened often), it cuts off my internet so nothing leaks out. That’s clutch when I'm sending private messages or uploading stuff.

For people in more sensitive situations like journalists or activists there’s a Double VPN option, which routes your connection through two servers for even more protection. I don’t use it every day, but it's good to know it's there.

Another bonus? VeePN has NetGuard, which blocks ads and trackers. It also helps avoid clicking shady links that sometimes pop up on social feeds. Their split tunneling feature is cool too, I can choose which apps go through the VPN and which don’t.

Performance wise, I’ve had no issues. They’ve got over 2500 servers in 89 locations, so I get fast connections without big speed drops. I watch videos and upload content without any lag.

And yeah, it works on basically everything. I have it on my phone, laptop, browser, and even my Smart TV. One subscription covers up to 10 devices, which is more than enough for me, but they offer add ons if you need more.

Price wise, it's super reasonable. I got mine for about $2.49/month with a 30 day money back guarantee. It’s honestly a small price to pay for the privacy and security I get in return.

If you spend any time on social media especially on public networks I really recommend checking out [VeePN](http://www.veepn.com). It’s been a game changer for how I browse and share online.

1ljjlzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterSurvivorsGame/comments/1ljjlzk/has_anyone_noticed_this_game_has_started_feeling/,Has anyone noticed this game has started feeling increasingly unfriendly?,"I used to love this game. It was fun to play, didn't feel too heavy handed with ads, the loop was engaging, etc. All around, a fun diversion especially at work with nothing to do or when commuting. Lately, though, it feels like it's getting hostile. Some of the things it does baffle me and straight up feel targeted to make me lose. 

Some examples from recent runs:
-Playing Journey, starting with less than 100HP and enemies doing 25-30 damage per hit. 
-In the normal mode, the game hitting a point where it's like it realizes I'm too strong/getting thru the levels too easily and ramps the difficulty up big time. 
-Level 32 w/ a Legendary lvl25 Echo, full lvl30 purple gear (strike set), purple lvl30 prospero. A little past the halfway point I had around 1100HP, Vampire at 4/6, dual swords and dual plasma guns, and various other buffs and items. Usually go crit up to crit kills cause explosions, armor/hp, range, fire rate, etc. I was able to sit in the middle of a horde and just soak, between my armor, vampire, and my items I was remaining at or just under full HP. Next level, a regular phase, I kept getting chunked. The mobs went from doing 90-120 damage to doing 300+ per hit and the vampirism went from feeling like drinking from a fire hose to sipping from a coffee stirring straw. I almost died a few times. By the time I got to the boss, I had the HP skill revive, an angelic bulwark, and almost 1400 HP with a ton of armor and shields, maxed vampire w/ vampire upgrades, etc. The boss hit me with a tiny orb and did 1100 damage in 1 hit.

How the hell are you supposed to combat that? I was stacked, and 1 hit from one of the tiny bouncing balls that flies all over takes almost every scrap of HP. Despite the constant attacking, my vampirism was barely healing me (maxed vampirism with multiple vampire items and each tick was still only doing +1).

Anyone else get the feeling something changed? ",1,1750791261.0,MonsterSurvivorsGame,0,1.0,False

""Dev'essere pazzo…” He spatial at me calling the attention of the closest chef beside me.



No…I want mad.



I kept my head down as the restaurant manager yelled at the top of his voice. The last time I had looked at him, as he spoke, his spittle that went flying out from his mouth ended up washing my face.



""Once beaten, twice shy"" was something I was quite accustomed to. I knew that my manager would take silence as a sign of submission. Men like him preferred ego play rather than being right.



I said nothing, and he continued to fire rapid Italian at me.



Of course, I had done nothing wrong, but the man just liked to make a mountain out of a molehill. Couple with my exhaustion from my classes earlier in the day, I was in no mood to argue.



“Perché stai intralciando tutti? Sei così disoccupato? Perché devi starsene lì in giro sembrando un pomodoro! Sì, un grande idiota!”



I was apparently an idiot and a tomato according to him. 



The large kitchen bustled behind me, but some of the kitchen staff had chosen to stay in instead of work.



It's them you should yell at, not me, I thought. I was constantly picked upon by this man.



Giuseppe had been nothing more than a thorn in my flesh since I started working at the restaurant. While I thought it was because I was simply new, the treatment had lasted over six months now, and there were yet more new staff.



He pointed in front of me and finally dismissed me. I deepened the bow and scurried over to the table I was serving.



“You good?” I heard a voice behind me. It was the chef that jumped when Guiseppe was yelling.



“Yeah.”



“There's a customer outside. Why don't you leave the dishes…I'll handle them.” He said with a smile.



I pushed ioen the door connecting the kitchen from the main dining area to find that the customers had gone but had been replaced by a single man.



His long muscular legs were crossed and clad in beach trousers. He wore a white shirt that was rolled up to his sleeves to expose his tattoos.



On his neck was a necklace of something that looked



like an anchor, but I wasn't sure as I wasn't close enough. His face was blocked by the magazine he was reading, but his long, veiny fingers were quite eye-catching for me.



""Is there something I can get you, sir?"" I asked in English. The mysterious man put down his magazine and turned bright hazel eyes to look at me.



Holy virgin.



His gaze was burning, and the hazel of his eyes were almost a deep amber color. He had a straight nose, full lips, and a jaw sharp enough to cut through butter. He was quite a handsome man.



I shook my head to clear my thoughts and asked again. ""Is there something I can get you, sir?"" The man smiled just a bit, with the smile not quite reaching his eyes.



""Coffee,"" he answered in a deep voice that sent shivers down my spine. Feeling the need to leave his presence, I quickly skirted away with eyes wide open, and picked up the job of hot coffee and went back to his table.



Completely avoiding his gaze, I kept my eyes focused on the coffee in front of me. The last thing I wanted was to spill coffee over his expensive-looking brown leather shoes and get scolded again by my manager. It was quite rare for me to get scolded twice a day, but a regular daily scolding was normal.



Just as I was about to pour his cup, I heard him mumble something. ""I'm sorry, what?"" I asked. He shook his head. ""Damon. That's my name. What's yours?"" he asked, with a slight smile tugging at his lips.



Those lips… 



""I'm sorry, what?"" I asked again, all of a sudden feeling very repetitive. I shook my head at my own actions. This is very unlike me. Men were secondary in my life at the moment, so I couldn't explain why I felt this way. Sensing my discomfort, the stranger smiled. ""Elena."" I answered.



He leaned forward and rested his elbows on the table, bringing himself dangerously close to me. I swallowed loudly and watched as his eyes moved over my neck.



Those eyes… 



Distracted and trying to regain my composure, I turned back to the coffee jug I held and hugged it to my chest as though it would shield me from his gaze. ""Pretty name,"" he said in a deep voice. ""Did your mother give it to you?""



I froze at the sound of the word ""mother."" I barely knew the woman, but it felt strange talking about myself with someone I had just met. I only knew my mother in the last moments of my life and even struggled to remember my face.



Feeling clueless, I nodded and plastered a fake smile on my face. The man, called Damon, released a low hum that sounded like a purr of a large cat.



But he was a beast. He seemed like a beast ready to pounce on me at any given moment. I looked up from the coffee I was holding and focused my eyes on his nose, afraid to meet his gaze.



""W-Will that be all?"" I stammered. His lips curved into a slow and sensual smile that promised strange things and sweaty nights. I bluId pink.



He shook his head. ""When I need you, I'll call you. I would love to likely be getting another cup of coffee, so please stick around,"" he said.



I all but ran back to the kitchen once he nodded at me to leave. On shaky legs, I leaned against the cold kitchen counter where the chefs kneaded bread.



I didn't know why I felt that way but the man made me extremely nervous and self-conscious . Not wanting Giuseppe to find me idle, I quickly glanced around to see if Giuseppe was close to me. He wasn't, making it incredibly lucky for me.



I took in a couple more breaths before straightening myself away from the counter. my legs were still shaking, and most of all, my underwear was ruined.



The mere fact that he looked deep into my eyes and smiled the way he did was more than enough to release the torrents between my legs.



I was wet and bothered.



I huffed and picked up the jug of coffee beside me. As soon as I set it down at its rightful position, I looked back to find Damon on the phone.



His eyebrows were drawn together, and he drummed his fingers rapidly on the table. Whatever that was, it looked urgent because he stood up, dropped a couple of Iets of money, and walked off quickly.



I let out a breath that I didn't know I was holding. In a way, I was glad that he was gone. He confused me and made me feel in a way that I had never felt before.



I hoped that I wouldn't encounter him again. Encounters such as the one I just had were like Christmas or even worse, a lunar eclipse. Stuff like that only happened once in a lifetime.



# 2



Elena



Evenings were my favorite time. I would finish work or school and happily skip to the dark streets of Rome with one destination in mind.



Aside from the tourists, which offered much entertainment, it was a favorite place to be after a tedious day at work.



I cut through the crowded streets using alleys and backways, easily navigating the darkness as though I were familiar. And I was familiar with it.



I knew the path like the back of my hand and wasn't afraid to tread there even at night. My destination was the arena. The arena served as my escape from reality.



Sandwiched between school and work, I was constantly torn apart by responsibilities. Not forgetting Pablo's consistent calls, I was truly stumped and needed some respite.



The building was a warehouse. It wasn't dilapidated and old, but it was refurbished. I heard that some rich mafia man found it amusing to watch people fight without the strict rules of MMA.



The arena, however, was a cheap dump littered with adrenaline junkies like myself. I only needed a couple of coins to make my way inside, and sometimes I would get in for free.



Crowded nights like tonight were one of those nights. I smiled at the large doorman who served as both a bouncer and a collector. Fred wasn't Italian, but he had mostly acclimatized into society.



Fred nodded his head at me and returned my smile with a wink. He blocked the people who were crowded in front of him and made way just for me. With a giggle, I patted his hand and walked right in.



The warehouse could normally fit a thousand people standing side by side, including the circular ring. But that was only on slow nights. On nights such as this, at least 5,000 people were crammed in the small space making the atmosphere hot and humid.



Just above the ring was a hanging light that illuminated the caged ring below. There were no seats. People stood, and some brought tables so they could stand and watch the fight from a farther and higher distance.



The arena had high ceilings that accommodated a gallery on the second floor. More people stood there, but they were fewer. They were VIPs. The gallery housed different cubicles and chairs that served as perfect viewing spots for those who could afford it.



I never dreamed of staying there. I had a spot that I liked to stand surrounded by people I had come to know.



There was Paul, Edmond, and Julian. The three would always keep my spot for me. Paul waved me over as soon as he spotted me. With an enthusiastic wave in response, I elbowed my way through the sweaty crowd.



The fight hadn't even started, but the crowd was already hailing in anticipation of the fight.



Apparently, some new guy was coming in from outside to challenge one of the best fighters the arena had ever seen.



Paul grabbed my hand and pulled me up to the table they had secured. As I stood there, I felt the worries of the day melt away and dissolve into the rhythmic chant of the crowd for the one they called ‘the Iron Fist.’



The arena was not a pretty place. In fact, no ladies should be found in such an establishment.



The place smelled like urine, sweat, blood, and money. So in all ramifications, I shouldn't be found in such a place. But it was the only place I felt truly alive. It was the only place I felt I could be myself.



So the announcer entered the ring. ""Ladies and gentlemen! Let's jump right into it. In the red corner, we have one of our best."" The hall was silent as they waited for the introduction of the world-known Iron Fist.



""He's strong, he's fast, he is heavy with the fists, ladies and gentlemen, benefactors, and others, I present to you Iron Fist!"" The crowd went wild with cheers and chants.



I smiled as I burned the memory and the sound into my mind. The hall fell silent again as soon as the announcer raised his left hand, signifying silence.



""On the blue side is a newcomer. A desperado if you must. He's confident that he can take on one of the best in the business."" The statement warranted a few laughs from people in the gallery.



I looked up to find them smiling and snickering. Perhaps they knew it would be a beatdown, but I chose to keep my eyes open.



""Ladies and gentlemen, he is unknown, he has no name. So let us call him the Tattooed Maniac."" This one got more laughs from people as the announcer smiled at his own hubris.



The arena fell silent. Just as the fighter came out, I couldn't help but widen my eyes. It's not like he was small. He was quite tall and with well-defined muscles, he looked formidable.



The name the announcer gave him made me think he was covered in tattoos from head to toe. But I was wrong. He had some, but not enough to cover his skin.



He looked familiar, and since I was quite close to the ring, I could see what made him so familiar – the necklace he wore.



Normally jewelry wasn't allowed in the ring, but whoever he was, they allowed it anyway. It was the man from the restaurant. Damon, I remembered, was his name.



I looked at him closely, my eyes scrutinizing every inch of his body. His thighs didn't look merely muscled, but they seemed to have power in them for a few explosive movements. His biceps strained as he lifted his fists in a ready stance.



His stance was strange. It wasn't the typical boxing stance; it reminded me of Thai boxing.



His hands were closer to his ears, and his head was ducted down in between his elbows, giving him a lesser field of vision. But it was a stance that I had seen in action all too well. I knew that Damon would win even before he landed the first punch.



I quickly raised my hands as the man yelling, ""Place your bets,"" came around me. I dropped €20, my last cash, much to the protests of my friends.



""I bet on the Tattooed Maniac,"" I said, earning a startled look from the man himself. He shook his head and quickly wrote me a tally. I quickly moved my eyes back to the fight that hadn't even started.



As soon as the referee dropped his white handkerchief, the two men collided. It was quicker than I thought. But the Iron Fist swung with a wide punch that would have incapacitated his previous opponents. But I knew I placed my bet on the right fighter.



Damon instantly dodged and returned with an uppercut to the Iron Fist's chin. Dazed, the Iron Fist shook his head and tried to retaliate with another wide punch.



The swing was slow, and Damon saw it. He didn't duck, but took a step backward, allowing the Iron Fist to spin under the weight and power of his own fists.



As soon as the Iron Fist stopped spinning, Damon punched him again with an uppercut. This one knocked him out. The fight was over in less than a minute.



The crowd didn't cheer; they just stood silent. But I smiled and fist-bumped into the air, careful not to disturb the silence. I looked back at the ring to find Damon looking straight at me. He turned his head to one side and let out a little smile. He winked and then turned away.



Just what was that? I asked myself, feeling a rush of heat rise to my cheeks and another between my thighs.",1,1750791234.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1ljjkoq,https://i.redd.it/ndf135x19x8f1.jpeg,"From “Are you pregnant?” to “Damn, girl!” – My Lazy Girl Weight Loss Miracle","
Let me tell you the truth, not the Instagram-filtered kind.

Pre-pandemic, I was that red-haired head-turner with a 26-inch waistline—fit, fierce, and confident. Then life hit me hard. Stress, long hours, zero movement, comfort eating, and next thing you know… I stopped measuring my waist at 36 because I couldn’t take the number anymore. People thought I was expecting. My clothes didn’t fit. My confidence vanished. I was showing up to client meetings praying my outfit would do something, anything, to make me feel normal again.

Worse? I started questioning if my team still respected me, if my husband still found me attractive, if my worth was fading with every extra kilo. I’d cry in front of the mirror, not because “slim = beautiful,” but because I didn’t feel like me anymore.

I tried everything. Pills. Coffees. Teas. Lipo RFs. Nothing. I work 12-14 hours, 6 days a week. I drink. I smoke. I don’t walk. I don’t gym. I needed something that would work for my lifestyle—no sugar-coating.

Then I found SF.

Desperate, I messaged Miss Glen. No questions asked, just help me. 30 minutes later, my order was being packed. I started Tirze.

💥 First dose in—and no joke—I went from inhaling a full pizza to barely managing a quarter slice. I didn’t force myself. I just felt done eating. No cravings, no obsession with food.

🌙 A month later? People stopped asking if I was pregnant. My face slimmed down. Arms, legs, back—everything was trimming down. Clothes fit. Confidence returned. Now, it’s June 2025 and I’m a curvy, stylish, smoky arse mumma rocking a size Medium again! Not skinny. Not pressured. Just happy.

And the best part?
No workouts. No 10,000 steps. No starvation.
Just Tirze, every 4–5 days. Currently on 5mg and it still works for me.

💖 What I love about SF & Tirze:

✅ You feel full faster
✅ Fat melts evenly—arms, thighs, even those stubborn back rolls
✅ No rebound even when you miss a dose
✅ Perfect for us busy, burnt-out girlies who just want to feel good again

⚠️ Heads-up though:
🚰 Drink water—3L a day at least
😵‍💫 Don’t skip meals, even if you’re not hungry (yes, Tirze does that)
😴 I do feel a bit tired sometimes, but I think it’s more my 14-hour shifts than the med

This is my miracle.
From hiding in Zoom calls to strutting into meetings again.
From self-doubt to quiet confidence.
I’m not done yet, but damn, I’m proud.
Thank you Miss Glen and the SF fam—you saved me from surgery, from shame, from myself.

To anyone who feels stuck in their body—lazy, exhausted, hopeless—you’re not alone. You just need the right push. I found mine. 💋",0,1750791179.0,CasualPH,2,0.3,False

Details from website (Harper Collins Canada)

About the Book

From the internationally bestselling author of the Morisaki Bookshop novels comes a charming and poignant story set at a quiet Tokyo café where customers find unexpected connection and experience everyday miracles.

Tucked away on a narrow side street in Tokyo is the Torunka Café, a neighborhood nook where the passersby are as likely to be local cats as tourists. Its regulars include Chinatsu Yukimura, a mysterious young woman who always leaves behind a napkin folded into the shape of a ballerina; Hiroyuki Numata, a middle-aged man who’s returned to the neighborhood searching for the happy life he once gave up; and Shizuku, the café owner’s teenage daughter, who is still coming to terms with her sister’s death as she falls in love for the first time.

While Café Torunka serves up a perfect cup of coffee, it provides these sundry souls with nourishment far more lasting. Satoshi Yagisawa brilliantly illuminates the periods in our lives where we feel lost—and how we find our way again.

1ljjhg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1ljjhg0/how_do_couples_typically_balance_household/,How do couples typically balance household responsibilities when one partner works longer hours and the other is currently at home?,"My husband is a resident physician and currently works three jobs. On some days, he’s gone for 12–13 hours, 4 days a week. He has Friday evening through Sunday off.

I’m currently not earning — I’m actively job searching (it’s been a slower market in my field) and also working on starting a business. At the same time, I handle most of the household responsibilities: cooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, taking care of our cat, household maintenance, and vacation planning.

His only household contribution is putting his laundry in the washer and dryer and then leaving it in the dryer for me to fold during the week. This sometimes ends up blocking the machines when I need to do my own laundry or wash sheets. He also usually expects his meals to be heated up when he comes home after work.

He feels that because I’m home, I have more time, and that he works very hard during the week and should be able to fully rest or go out on weekends. He’s not really interested in doing things like grocery shopping or errands together — which I understand to some extent — but it means those tasks continue falling solely on me during the week.

He acts like he “works really hard for me” “work very hard” “does so much for me”- all his words. Even though I’m not earning, and he is, I really limit my expenses and barely ever go out for coffee or do things for myself.

I’m trying to understand if this kind of division is typical, especially when one partner isn’t earning at the moment. How do other couples in similar situations divide responsibilities fairly while also respecting each other’s time and effort? I dont want to feel like a maid servant.

TL;DR:
Husband works 3 jobs and is gone long hours during the week; I’m currently job hunting, working on a business, and handling nearly all household tasks. He does minimal chores and expects to fully rest on weekends. Wondering how other couples balance responsibilities fairly when one partner isn’t earning but is still working from home.

1ljjdjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1ljjdjd/mating_moon_complete_story_link/,Mating Moon Complete Story Link?,"I sat in our Ford F350 truck, pulling a horse trailer behind it, my cheek against the cool window of the truck. Mom was driving now, giving me a break, humming along to some old country song. I wasn't even paying attention to what it was at this point. We had been on the road for three days now. Three long days. I couldn't wait to get there.

I let out a loud audible sigh and turned to my mother, ""How much further till we stop? I've gotta pee.""

She looked down at the gas gauge and over to the GPS that was on the dash console. She shrugged her shoulders, ""I'd say another twenty minutes till we hit the next gas station. Can you wait that long? Or you want me to pull over and you can find a bush."" She smiled, knowing I did not want to ""find a bush"". Especially not in unfamiliar territory.

""I can wait."" I sat up straighter and reached over to the radio, pushing the eject button for the CD she had playing.

""Hey,"" she looked pissed. ""I was listening to that.""

I shrugged. ""It's making me sleepy. We need something more upbeat. I don't know how you can stand to listen to that for hours on end.""

""The point dear daughter, IS for you to sleep."" She smiled but it didn't go to her eyes. I stared at Mom for a few minutes. She looked tired. She looked tense. She kept looking in the mirrors, I'm guessing she thought someone would follow us. She had her long hair thrown up in a pony tail, little wisps of her brown curls falling out around her face. My mother was beautiful. She always had been. The bruise on her cheek was now a faded yellow, almost gone. I sighed and looked away, rubbing my sore thigh. We just have to get there, and we would be safe.

Three Days Prior

I had just graduated Veterinary School. I was home with my mother during the day, a rarity since I was typically at school. But now I was finished. I was Dr. Ashlyn Cane. I was working on my resume and looking over some near by postings for Vets. Mom leaning over my shoulder giving her opinion now and then. She knew more about these places than I did. She had been here most of her life.

My father wasn't home. I was glad. He was drunk most of the time. He was loud and over bearing. He spent a lot of time at the bar, hitting on the waitresses and tossing back whiskey like it was water. It took a lot of liquor to get our kind drunk. Werewolves had a high tolerance, since our metabolisms were so fast, it burned off quickly. If I had to guess, I'd say Grady Cane (that was my father, but I rarely called him Dad), drank about two gallons of whiskey a day. His stupor generally lasted long enough for him to fuck some floozy at the bar, and then come home and knock my Mom around a bit. He'd sleep it off and then get up and go to work the night shift at the lumber mill. My opinion of my father, he was a piece of crap. But Mom was mated to him, so she felt the pull that made her stay. She also felt it every time he was cheating on her, pain in her stomach. I would hear her sometimes, laying in her room, crying. I hated him.

Mom was just pulling dinner out of the oven, as I was packing up my laptop and papers to go put them away. Grady stumbled in the kitchen door, his eyes instantly on me. ""What the fuck are you doing here?"" he growled out.

""Um I live here."" I continued to try to make my way to the stairs, to head to my room.

He growled at me. Actually growled. I stopped dead in my tracks, looking him in the eyes. His eyes were blood shot, and the smell of liquor was heavy on him. I glanced nervously at Mom, as she set the pot roast on the counter and turned to him. ""Grady, leave Ash alone. She's done with school. She's trying to work on her resume and find a job. Now let's get ready to eat dinner before it gets cold."" Her voice was soft, timid. I knew she was trying to defuse something that I wasn't even truly aware was happening. I glanced back to his face, he was still staring at me. He hadn't even looked Mom's way.

""Don't fucking tell me what to do Carolyn,"" he shifted his gaze to my Mother again. She took a step back from the counter, inching towards the other end of the kitchen island. I stood there, paralyzed. I wasn't sure what I should do, but the moment he lunged for me, I shifted. I was not going to allow him to try and hurt us. Since he was so drunk, he couldn't shift.

Grady must have realized what was happening, because he grabbed a kitchen knife that had been laying on the counter and swung it at me, as I lunged at him. It stabbed me in the leg. I whimpered as I hit the floor, blood oozing from my leg. I instantly shifted back to my human form, placing pressure on my thigh. Grady had never hurt me before, but I was also not typically home at the same time as him

Mom screamed at him, ""What the hell are you doing Grady?"" I lay on the floor, holding pressure on my wound, as I watched him stalk towards my mother, a menacing look on his face. He had dropped the knife on the floor the instant it hit my leg. I looked at it, then back at him as he kept moving towards my mother.

I watched as Grady slammed his fist into my mothers face. He was huge and my mother was petite, he sent her flying back. Her back hit the refrigerator hard and she slid down it to her butt. ""You don't raise your voice at me! This is my fucking house,""he was seething, his spittle hitting her in the face. Mom sat there with her hand against her eye. She just sat there, looking at the floor, not making eye contact.

I was pissed. I picked up the knife, grabbed my cell phone and limped out the back door. I was going to call my Uncle. He was the Alpha. Our house sat at the very edge of Pack Land, closest to the human town, but far from other pack members. My father never wanted to be near other pack members. He liked his privacy. I would assume so he could terrorize my mother without anyone knowing. Specifically the Alpha.

We had five acres, a pasture out back that was fenced in, and horse barn. I had two horses out in the barn. I had trained them myself, something I was proud of. My father hated that I was talented at taking care of animals. He would always make comments about how he was surprised that someone as weak as me could tame any animal. He was an asshole.

I limped over to the barn, dialing my uncle. He answered on the first ring. ""Hey Ash, heard you graduated! Congrats.""

I whimpered as I bumped my leg on the fence as I climbed through it. He heard me. ""Ash, what's wrong?""

""I think you need to come here as fast as you can. My father is drunk. He stabbed me in the leg and he's inside with Mom. He punched her in the face."" I started crying, something I rarely did.

My Uncle didn't know that my Mom was being abused, she never told anyone. She was embarrassed. She would stay away from the others when she had visible injuries. She told me to never tell Uncle Tobias. This time, I didn't care. My father had to pay. I heard the my Uncle hang up the phone, without so much as a word. I knew it would be just a few minutes before he got there with some of the enforcers.

My Uncle Tobias arrived five minutes later, with his Beta and three enforcers. He saw me sitting in the pasture, my back resting against a fence post, holding pressure on my leg. It had almost quit bleeding. I just needed a couple of stitches so it wouldn't scar, but I couldn't quite get to the barn to grab my suture kit from the office. I was shaking inside. Tobias motioned to his Beta to come to my aid, as he made his way into the house, one enforcer remained outside, his eyes trained on me, and shifting back and force to the screen door that my Uncle had just gone through.

I heard some yelling, but couldn't make out what they were saying. The Beta helped me stand and we made our way to the barn. I quickly cleaned my wound and put a few tight stitches in. We made our way back outside. As were walked towards the house, I suddenly saw Grady get tossed right out the door into the yard, the two enforcers that had been inside were right behind him. My Uncle came out a couple minutes later, carrying my mother in his arms. Her whole face was bloody, her lip busted open and a trickle of blood coming down her forehead. I could hear her softly whimpering.

The enforcers grabbed Grady by his arms, hauling him up. The third enforcer starting pounding into his face. My Uncle said something to them, so quiet I couldn't hear it. They simply nodded, threw Grady in the pack of one their trucks and drove away. My Uncle snapped his head my way, making eye contact. ""Ash, get in the car now. I need to take your mother to the doctor. Then we are going to have a serious chat."" He strode the car, laying Mom down in the back seat. The Beta helped me hobble to the car and get into the back, me gently putting Mom's head in my lap. She sat there crying quietly.

And that is how we ended up leaving Northern California and our beautiful Red Woods forest behind. We both were treated at the hospital, then went to sit with my Uncle as he made a few phone calls. He asked me if I thought I could drive with my leg the way it was. I could. It was my left leg, and the truck was an automatic. We went back to the house, and packed up some things, loaded my horses and tack, and hit the road, heading to Montana. We were going somewhere outside Great Falls. If we were both in tip top shape, it was an easy 2 day drive. But we would need to stop more frequently to let our wounds heal. We weren't going to be able to shift while traveling, it could be dangerous. And shifting was the fastest way to heal.

I had no idea we even had family in Montana, but apparently I had another Uncle, and he was Alpha of the Lone Wolf Stables in Montana. The name was of course a cover up, so the humans didn't catch on. And it really was a horse ranch, which excited me. I was going to be their Veterinarian, much to my surprise. It was part of the deal my Uncle made, so we could start a new life. He didn't want my mother to feel ashamed of what had happened, so he gave her the one thing she asked, let us move away and start over.

We pulled into the little gas station that was seemingly in the middle of nowhere. We were somewhere in Idaho. I thought I saw a sign that said Idaho Falls, but since I was half asleep, I couldn't be sure.

Mom pulled in next to a gas pump, handed me the card, so she wouldn't have to go inside. She didn't want anyone seeing her face. It was still healing, and she didn't want people staring. I opened the door, a little bell jingling as it opened. There was a guy behind the counter reading a magazine. He looked up, his eye catching mine. Instantly I knew, Werewolf. We must have crossed into another Pack's territory. We better make this quick, and get moving.

I walked to the counter, acting like it was no big deal that we were here. I handed him the card, ""Gonna fill up on pump 2 please."" He glanced out the window and saw Mom had pulled the pump handle and was standing there waiting to pump the gas, as she glanced around on high alert.

He snatched the card from my hand and swiped it and handed it back, without a word. ""Thank you sir, can I use the restroom?"" He grunted and pointed at a sign to his right that said restroom. I smiled a thank you and walked to the bathroom. I quickly handled my business and walked out. There was now another guy in the little mini mart. There was no other car outside, so I found this odd, but just kept walking.

""Hey girl,"" the man from behind the counter said. I turned to look at him, one eyebrow cocked.

""What happened to her face?"" He pointed out the window towards my Mom who was now staring at me through the glass door, all her injuries clearly visible.

""Ummm, she got in a fight."" I didn't know what else to say. Our kind didn't allow domestic violence, it was punishable my death. Speaking of, my father should be nearing his death sentence. Alpha said they would torture him a bit, wait for him to sober up and then deal his sentence.

The other guy in the store approached me. ""You two ladies in some kind of trouble?"" He was looking me up and down. I had on a pair of denim shorts, my now healing wound visible.

Shit, I thought in my head. I looked at the guy behind the counter and back to this other one who felt like he could undress me with his eyes. ""Just passing through to Montana. We are fine."" I went to walk away and the guy grabbed my wrist.

""You don't look fine."" His voice was soft. I took another look at him, now that he was close. He was handsome, with dark brown hair and two dimples in his chiseled face. He had a five o'clock shadow, which only added to his allure. He had on a pair of cowboy boots and tight wranglers. Any other time I might be inclined to talk more, but we needed to get out of there.

I abruptly pulled my hand back. ""We don't want any trouble. We just have to get back on the road. Thanks for your concern."" I walked as fast as I could to the door, the little bell jingling as I walked out. I looked at my Mom, mind linking her to get in the truck now. Her eyes grew big, as I heard the door open behind me and Mr. Handsome followed me out. He stopped about two feet out of the door and stood with his hands in his pockets, not taking his eyes off me. I jumped into the passenger seat and closed the door, looking back at him as we pulled out. He stood there staring at me as we drove away. I sighed and sunk into my seat, willing Mom to drive faster and get us the hell out of this town.

We had just turned off the main interstate, somewhere outside Great Falls. I pulled the truck into the huge truck stop. It was filled with huge semi-trucks and big pick ups, some pulling trailers. Mom was asleep in the passenger seat, the seat layed back as far as it would go. She was wrapped in a fuzzy blanket. I looked over at her, tapping her on the shoulder. Then I hopped out to gas up the truck, stretching my back. We were almost there.

Mom must have woke when my door slammed shut. I heard the passenger door close and she walked around the front. ""Hey Ash, I'm going to go inside and use the bathroom. You want some coffee or something?"" I gave her the thumbs up and she pulled her hood up over her head, trying to hide as much of her face as she could.

I leaned back against the truck, closing my eyes for a minute, waiting for the pump to click, signaling it was finished. Once I was done fueling, I took a look around. There was a big grassy patch off to the side of the gas pumps. I pulled my truck in over by the grass and hopped out to exercise the horses. They had been cooped up in that trailer for days now. I had tried to let them out to stretch as much as I could.

Walking back to the rear of the trailer, I swung the door open and latched. I jumped up to grab my horse Bailey and let her stretch. Bailey was a roping horse, and I used her to work the cattle back at our old pack. I was hopeful that she would be of use where we were going. I felt just a little twinge in my leg, as I stretched my leg. It was pretty much healed. The tiniest of scars would remain, but otherwise it felt pretty good.

I was walking Bailey back and forth in the grass, when she stopped, ears perked up. I walked up and rubbed the side of her face, ""What's up girl? You nervous?,"" her nostrils flared at me. I looked around but didn't see anything, then went to put her back in the trailer. I was inside tying her lead rope and backing up Buck. Buck was my gelding. He was a Buckskin, hence his name. I wasn't any more creative than that I guess. Mom comes around showing me my coffee.

""You want me to drive?"" she says sipping her cup.

""Nah I'm good. We are almost there, right?"" I asked, as I stepped out of the trailer, swinging Buck's big butt around to the side of the trailer.

Mom looked around, pulled her phone out of her pocket, checking our location and her directions. ""Yep, looks like we have maybe two more hours. I grabbed us a couple of breakfast burritos from inside. They actually look edible,""she half laughed. ""I'm going to jump back in the truck, I don't like people staring at me. I got plenty of weird looks in there."" She went to walk away. I touched her arm.

""Mom, you need to stop worrying about what other people think. It's all going to be fine,"" she nodded her head. I had to ask her, ""Um, did you scent any other wolves in there?""

She looked back at me, a little smile on her lips. ""Maybe a couple. For sure some cute cowboys in there,"" she winked as she went to the cab of the truck. She knew my weakness.

Pacing Buck up and down the grass for a few minutes, I was talking to him, rubbing his thick dark mane of hair. He was a huge Buckskin. They weren't usually as big as he is, but he was a gentle giant. He didn't spook easily. So when he suddenly stopped short at the back end of the trailer and snorted, I knew something was up. I looked over to the tree line. Standing just barely out of sight was a huge chocolate brown wolf, his sparkling green eyes staring back at me. I wasn't sure what he was doing, if he was trying to scare me, or was just observing. He didn't try to come any closer, and it didn't appear anyone else could see him there. My trailer was blocking the line of sight. When the wolf made no effort to move, I turned and walked Buck to the back of the trailer to load him. I had my eye on the wolf in my peripheral vision.

As I jumped back out of the trailer, and latched the gate shut, the wind shifted and I caught a scent. It was the most amazing scent, like a combination of musk and leather. I tilted my head toward the tree line, the wolf was still there watching me. Oddly, I didn't feel threatened. I walked to the cab, and climbed in. As I closed the door and started up the truck, I took a peek back to the woods. The wolf was gone. Hmm, that was weird.",1,1750790731.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1ljjcho,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShilajitBenefits/comments/1ljjcho/the_5_most_noticeable_benefits_ive_experienced/,The 5 Most Noticeable Benefits I’ve Experienced from Shilajit,"As someone who’s been taking Shilajit consistently for over 3 years now after trying various forms, learning the difference between good and poor quality, and researching the science behind it here are the five benefits that I’ve found most noticeable and reliable:

1) More Stable, Natural Energy
Not a “jittery” stimulant effect like coffee but a deeper, more sustained energy. Shilajit supports mitochondrial function and helps the body produce energy more efficiently at the cellular level. Over time, this translates into better endurance and less of that afternoon crash.

2)Better Stress Tolerance & Mood Stability
Shilajit contains trace minerals and fulvic acid, which support adrenal function and hormone balance. I’ve noticed more resilience to stress and fewer mood swings, particularly in busy or demanding periods. It seems to help the body “buffer” against everyday stressors.

3) Support for Hormonal Balance
This one may vary person to person, but for me, it’s had a clear effect on maintaining healthy testosterone and overall hormonal health (which tends to decline gradually with age). It’s a big reason why Shilajit has been used traditionally in both men’s and women’s wellness for centuries.

4) Joint Comfort & Recovery
An unexpected bonus after about 2–3 months of regular use, I noticed improved joint flexibility and quicker recovery after physical activity. The anti-inflammatory properties and mineral content of Shilajit likely contribute here.

5) Mental Clarity - A subtle but clear improvement in focus, sharper memory, and less mental fatigue over the course of the day. Again, this seems tied to its role in supporting cellular energy and antioxidant activity.

The key, in my experience, is consistent use and choosing a truly high-quality resin, properly sourced Shilajit (there’s a lot of low-grade product on the market, sadly). The benefits build gradually — this isn’t a quick-fix supplement, but one that supports deep, long-term wellness.",1,1750790665.0,ShilajitBenefits,0,1.0,False
1ljj8l9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ljj8l9/aio_for_asking_to_not_debate_at_dinner_then/,"AIO for asking to not debate at dinner, then apologizing, but my best friend of 20 years is now completely on his new girlfriend’s side?","
A little background: I (33M) have been best friends with this guy for 20 years. We’ve always had a solid, respectful friendship and never had any major blowups. Recently, he started dating a new girl. A few nights ago, six of us (me, my girlfriend, my two best friends, and their girlfriends) all went out for dinner and drinks as sort of a sendoff for me.. I’m moving away for a new job for the next three years.

After a 4ish drinks, my best friend’s girlfriend brought up that women make less money than men in the medical field. I genuinely just said, “Oh, that’s interesting—my girlfriend is a doctor. Do you have any data on that?” I swear, I wasn’t trying to argue, I’m just an analytical person and wanted to know more.

Immediately, she got defensive and aggressive, saying she works in the medical field and sees it firsthand. She kept assuming I was challenging her, even though I tried to explain I wasn’t picking sides, just asking for info. I made it clear a couple of times that I didn’t want to get into a political debate at dinner and asked if we could drop it and send some data about it another time. I must have said two or three more times that I didn’t want to discuss politics, just that I’d appreciate data at a later point if she had it.

She didn’t respect my boundaries at all. She kept pushing, and after the third time I tried to end it, she just got up and stormed away. Some guy she apparently knew from the past bought her a shot at the bar, and then she sat alone until my friend went over to her. She ended the whole conversation by literally leaving the bar without giving me a chance to actually talk things out or clear the air. No apology from her—just left on a negative note, when the night was supposed to be about me leaving(maybe I’m selfish for thinking this):

Before they left, my best friend comes up and asks me to apologize to her. Wanting everyone to feel safe and not sure what the hell just happened, I went over and apologized, explaining that I’m not taking sides, I’m just an analytical person and I’m genuinely sorry. 

She never apologized to me, and actually told my best friend that I’m an asshole even after my apology.

For context, this girl has a habit of calling people names, especially my other best friend—she makes fun of his mustache, calls him small, and basically emasculates him in front of everyone, including his own girlfriend. She did it again that night and acted like it was funny.

Her boyfriend (my best friend, the one siding with her) tells me all the time that she hates “Beta” guys and says he tries not to act like one around her, because she’s constantly saying she doesn’t like Beta energy. He’s basically told me he tries not to be a Beta just to keep her happy.

Now my best friend is saying I’m the asshole here. He just wants me to admit I was the asshole and insists she did nothing wrong except storm off. I feel like her storming off completely removed my ability to have a constructive conversation, and that if she kept pushing her point, I was at least entitled to a real dialogue. But instead, it just felt like a power move: storming off, taking a shot, commandeering my friend, and then leaving the bar with him.

So now I’m wondering—should I even bother trying to stay friends with my best friend? 

Is it even possible to have a relationship with him while he’s dating someone who thinks I’m an absolute asshole? 

Should I try to reach out to her one-on-one and have coffee, or just let it go? 

It just sucks because I’m about to move away for three years and my best friend of 20 years is siding with someone he’s only known for a few months.

For the record, I called my friend and said I just want his girlfriend to feel safe around me and I’m happy to apologize again. He basically circled back to the whole thing and pushed for me to admit I was the asshole and I said I’m happy to say that I’m an asshole, but does he not see any wrong on her end and he said no.

So… AIO for how I handled this? And what should I do about my friend?",2,1750790428.0,AmIOverreacting,27,0.67,False
1ljj6zk,https://www.reddit.com/r/cabosanlucas/comments/1ljj6zk/water_quality_at_the_resorts/,Water quality at the resorts,"My wife, five year old son and I are traveling to a resort at Cabo next week and some of my work colleagues were teasing me about not drinking the water.  At first I thought it was an outdated rumor until I googled it and found that even today the tap water in Mexico, and even at Cabo resorts, is unsafe to drink. 

I'm unsure as to how this resonates throughout the resort. I would assume that any water provided to me to drink would be safe to drink.  Does this include coffee as well? What about cooking and cleaning dishes in this type of water? What about brushing teeth and bathing in this water? I take a few vitamins and medications, I presume I need to use bottled water for this.

My assumptions is that I'll be fine because if everyone was getting sick at these resorts no one would go.  I guess my concern is how diligent do I need to be to make sure I'm avoiding tap water on the resort.  Has anyone gone to a resort and had an issue with the water quality?

I've had plenty of electrolytes, a couple of cups of coffee, and I just feel wiped out. I don't think I'm truly hungry as I still have 70 extra lbs. of weight to lose. I read ""The Fasting Cure"" by Upton Sinclair yesterday, and I don't relate to the stories of people have surges of creative mental energy and writing for 16 hours a day. I've been minimally productive, and I've had to nap in the afternoon both yesterday and the day before.

24 hours into the fast my ketones were at 1.5, then 48 hours into the fast they were down to 0.9 mysteriously. It wasn't until 72 hours in that I started ""therapeutic ketosis"" at 2.5. This morning, I tested at 3.6, so the ketone machine is starting to get going. But what this indicates to me is that my metabolism is pretty unhealthy if it takes that long to start producing a significant number of ketones considering I've been on a keto/carnivore diet for 90 days now.

I did a 5-day fast a couple of weeks ago, which felt a little easier than this one for some reason. So far I have lost 30 lbs. from fasting. I was 249 lbs. about 93 days ago and this morning I weighed in at 219.

I am desperate to get better, and have been struggling with fatigue, brain fog, and body weight for years now. I'm sick and tired of feeling sick and tired. That being said, I'm not sure how to tell when I should continue a fast or break it.

Any feedback, advice, or encouragement would be greatly appreciated.",11,1750790066.0,fasting,10,0.93,False
1ljj2g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/1ljj2g5/the_soeoeiua_saga/,The SOEOEIUA Saga,"I matched with her on a dating app, pretty asian girl, she is over a decade younger than me but old enough to be out of post-secondary education and quite frankly was too good to be true.

I will tell some but not all because the story is still being written none the less I want to get something off my chest.

Our conversations started off very nonchalant, classic get to know you type convo, what do you like to watch, eat drink, life plans blah blah.

So maybe after 2 or 3 days of steady texting back and forth, she brings up that her hobby is trading crypto, and that the market is very good right now so she is looking to create a ""trading plan"" and ""make some money"".

I bring up how I used to be into options trading (real options in the stock market) and then she gets all excited and it progresses to her pressuring me to do it with her, she's been doing it for 4 years, and she can ""teach me"" how to trade crypto...

So she goes about telling me what apps I need to download first, some third party app that allows you to trade real money into bullshit coins.

It is so easy! just e-transfer your hard earned cash to this third party app, then simply buy USD Coin and then send it to [SOEOEIUA.com](http://SOEOEIUA.com) account you just made!

So we start out with $150 worth, she is texting me what time, the amount and whether to go long or short on the ""trades"".

She wins 75% of the trades but seemingly got greedy on the last one, so we only come out even, so no profit and then she tells me to withdraw, so I withdraw the money and boom it is back in my third party account.

As the days progress we are steady texting still but she keeps bringing up how good the market is, and that she is going to trade and that she wants me to make money with her!

So I bring the money back into SOEO and just like that we are trading and then in the span of 10 minutes, boom she is 4 for 4 on her trades, BUT she wants to go more... the market is HOT and she wants to make more, and that I should deposit more to increase the amount of profit we can make with bigger trades! Red flag #1 by the way, constantly pushing me to increase the amount in my account.

Before I continue the story, from start to finish I suspected something fishy the entire time, never gave her my personal phone number, never gave her any account information, she never had access to any of the money, all trades, deposits and withdrawals were done by me, but like a true dumbass I did not even listen to my own intuition.

So I deposit more money and WOW she keeps winning all these trades!

The next day THE MARKET IS STILL SMOKING HOT! and she's come up with a new ""trading plan"" and when we meet in person she will teach me how to trade like her, because after all it took her 4 years to learn how to do it right!

So we make more ""profit"" and red flag number 2 comes my way:

When I try to withdraw, the transaction is held back this time, well apparently my Profits have exceeded the amount I deposited, and well simply put that just isn't allowed!

This ""rule"" is loosely written in their ""Trading Risk Tips"" a little hyperlink that you'd never click because obviously you know the risk involved, you are trading crypto after all.

Since I violated this I am given 2 days to deposit more money into the account to put it back into a ""stable state"", which I do since I had the cash ready to go and thanks to the sunken cost fallacy, seems like a small amount of money in comparison to what is locked up.

Great! now I am free to withdraw it all right? WRONG Red flag number 3:

Due to their money laundering rules, whatever deposits you make, you need to make a subsequent trade for that same amount.

I detest with the ""support"" team how these two rules are in direct contradiction to each other.

But they assure me, ""just make the trades and then you can transfer the funds, immediately!"" always ending the conversation with ""have a happy life!"".

So I message Crypto girl and she says okay! let's make more profit since my account is in a ""grace period"" and I won't be hit with the aforementioned profit over principal rule!

We do some more ""trades"", and come out with some more ""profit"", not a crazy amount but still more.

Go to try and withdraw for a 3rd time, Ohhh no no, you need to pay taxes on the profit you made! I've lost count of red flags at this point, but I am seeing red. I am berating whoever is on the other end of the support chat, telling them none of this information is written anywhere, it doesn't make sense why I would be paying taxes in crypto coins, blah blah.

I'm only met with: You have 2 days to complete the task and there is no way they can cancel the withdrawal request some how magically because you know how else are they going to force me to pay my ""taxes"".

So like a dumbass, I come up with the money - despite my bank and third party app and my bank blocking me, trying to save me every step of the way.

Make a different account on a different app in an attempt to circumvent the first crypto app.

Transfer over the last amount needed to pay my ""taxes"". So they receive the funds and release the money back into my SOEO account, but since the first app was now frozen, I wanted to change the wallet address to second app.

Try to withdraw, not everything, just what I had deposited and BOOM you guessed it: can't withdraw it. Seeing crimson red at this point.

Do you know why? Well because The amount of money in my account now exceeds the ""VIP"" threshold, but I have not deposited enough to BE a VIP member. So now there is another batch of money they want me to deposit and you guessed it, I NEED TO DO IT IN 2 DAYS OR INCUR A 20% CHARGE EVERYDAY I'M LATE LIKE EVERY OTHER TASK - and then it will be something else... and then it will be something else, and by the end I would be drained of everything.

Thankfully I found a modicum of sense again, and am no longer giving into their bullshit.

At this point I am still talking to crypto girl, who is offering to put up some of her money to help pay off their newest demands, but I don't trust her anymore, how can you trust someone who is willing to give you their money despite you never meeting them and has had a hand in all of this nonsense.  Every hurdle with SOEO I have questioned her, how did you not know this? How did you not know about the profit principal rule? How did you not know about the money laundering rule? How did you not know about getting ""taxed"" and she's being trading for 4 years and somehow she didn't know about the VIP rule.

By the way, yes you read that right, this fucking dumbass writing the story hasn't even met her in person yet.

We've made plans to meet over coffee, or have talked about cutesie date ideas like an escape room or teaching her how to golf blah blah nothing ever happens though, always something comes up.

Filed a police report and am fully expecting to eat the loss on this, but all the same like a true dumbass I gave SOEO my driver's license to ""verify my account"", so there is some concern there.  
  
I have ceased communications with crypto girl since filing the report.

We will see what tomorrow brings, I am not completely drained of money and I will recover but this still really, really sucks, and truthfully I don't care much about the money, I just feel violated... not sure when I'll ever truly trust a stranger again.

I’m an independent journalist (not based in Belgium) currently researching a murder case that took place in Belgium in October 2017. The victim was a Kenyan woman named Elizabeth Wafula, and her partner, James Ololo, was found guilty and jailed in 2022.

I’m trying to access the court proceedings or judgment, but I’ve hit a wall, Belgium’s national court database (Just-on-Web) requires a Belgian ID to log in.

Would anyone here be willing to help access the documents or point me in the right direction on how I might go about it? I’d be happy to buy you an e-coffee for your troubles.

Thanks so much in advance!

I think it's around 12 years old, and seems well loved, but it still seems to work great. Only issue is a button that sometimes is hard to press before it beeps.

It was also really dirty when I got it with all kinds of old coffee dried and stuck to it, so gave it a thorough cleaning. 

I'm really new to this kinda machine, so it has been fun digging through all of the settings it has, including the built in cup warmer.

I won't give it to her if it's some sort of unsafe plastic. I know the brand is renowned and actual generations old but I want to doublecheck if anyone knows first.

Right now she's literally just using a travel water bottle, fully plastic, for her coffee.

1ljipq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1ljipq9/moving_away_from_family_guilt/,Moving away from family guilt?,"So when my (f26) husband(m30) and I got married 5 years ago we moved into an apartment in between his family and my family. About 30 minutes each direction. We would get bored and go to my family house all the time. We’d even stay the weekends over there a lot. 

About a year later, we got pregnant and bought our first home literally 3 minutes away from my parents home. My mom and I are super, super close and we hang out every day. We go to the gym, get coffee, shop, etc. every day just about. We’re both SAHMs. She’s super close with my sons (1 & 3) and sees them every day. They like to go over to her house multiple times a week. Or some days, if my husband goes to his office (he works from home most of the time) he will drop us off at her house and we just hang out there. You get the idea of how close we are. 

Not saying we don’t spend time with other family or my husband’s family- I’m just sharing the dynamic between my mom and I because that’s the only thing holding me back from possibly moving. 

The problem is the city we live in. I’ve lived here my whole life and I’ve never felt home here. I’ve just had to accept it because that’s where my family is. I would love and I dream about moving somewhere else. I’d love to move across the country but realistically that’s not gonna happen. Another city I’d love to live in is 1.5 hours away. It’s not like that’s far- it would just change my lifestyle because things would be very different. 

If we move I’d like to do it relatively soon because my oldest son will be starting school in a couple years and I want them to go to the same school K-12th to provide that stability. I just feel it wouldn’t be fair to my sons or to my mom. To change their relationship because they’re so close. I lived next door to my grandparents growing up and it was the best. I love that my sons have that. 

I have lived in the city I’m referring to for a bit during college and loved it. I would dream about living there when I got older and raising my kids there. If we move to that city, we’d also be moving in the opposite direction of my in laws so that would be 2.5 hrs from them. As much as I’m unhappy in my current environment, should I just stop being selfish and settle for the sake of having the family/relationships/the village I have here? 

I should probably also add that my husband is down for whatever. He says yes to everything I ask for. He likes our current city but he also always hints at moving too. 

TL;DR I would love to move but I would be giving up my village as I have 2 toddlers",2,1750789221.0,family,2,1.0,False

But I've got some questions about its battery life that I'm hoping you all can help with.

The specs say it can do 5 cold water brews or an  200+ hot water brews. That's a huge difference.

Realistically, how much of a difference does using pre heated water actually make to the battery life in your experience? Also, is that 5 shot cold water heating capacity generally enough for longer trips, or do you find it really beneficial to pre heat water to keep the battery going? I'm thinking about bringing a hot water kettle with me anyway.

Any insights would be super helpful for planning!",4,1750788939.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

More steep gravel switchbacks and loathsome ripios. More frantic marathons between tight ferry connections. Bucolic harbor towns idling in the steam of hot morning coffee and the trumpeting foghorn of imminent departures. Falling asleep on the boat’s steel cargo deck floor, an exhausted heap puddled beneath my own bike. Waves lapping at my shoes. Gently rocked between dreams by the motor’s calming troll.
 
A spoke explodes in the dust of rocky shrapnel. Then another. My bike is growing resistant to the finish line, it seems. I’ve overworked its drivetrain by some 7,000 miles and replacement parts have remained nearly impossible to source across the entirety of South America.
 
Lashing the two broken spokes together with an old strip of velcro, I rode another hundred miles to Chaitén, the next-closest village, where an abuelito was riding a rusted mountain bike of his own. I asked if he knew any mechanics nearby. “Siempre llevo radias extras conmigo, pero no las herramientas exactas a reemplezarlas.” He said there was someone named Jorquera a few kilometers south of town. I surveyed more locals to see if anyone had his phone number until a friendly older couple wrote it down and invited me back for breakfast the next day if I needed to stick around.
 
Jorquera’s bike shop was a happy kind of chaos. A tired wooden tool shed in the forest, half cobwebs, half scattered tools and blackened rags. He rustled through them like an anthropologist, unearthing just the right wrench from a tangled pile of discarded parts.
 
His work pace was frenzied and his Spanish was even faster, nearly impossible to translate in time with the lyrical wave of bikepacking formalities. “Donde vienes y adonde vas? Hablas bien español, como aprendías?” You get used to strangers feeling more like family, a universal camaraderie between the smashing of tools and instant coffee. “How bad are the ripios?” I always ask, as if it helps to know. “When will the road start to climb? A storm is coming, have you heard any news?”
 
We couldn’t unlatch my cassette’s lockring, even after hammering away at it with a flathead wedge, so Jorquera snipped a spoke bead off from its tip and bent the rod into place.

As an academic researcher who mentors students, I’ve seen firsthand how the right *essay writing help* can make or break a semester—especially when you’re in survival mode.

Recently, I decided to test [https://papersroo.com/](https://papersroo.com/) to see if it really deserves its spot among the *best writing services*. TL;DR? It surprised me—in a good way.

🔍 What Papersroo Offers:

* Rush deadlines: as short as 3 hours  
* Free features: formatting, title page, revisions  
* 24/7 support (yes, even at 2 AM)  
* User rating: ★★★★☆ (4.6/5 from 1,200+ reviews)  

My Experience: I ordered a 1500-word analytical essay on *climate policy in the EU*. Gave them a tight 6-hour deadline to really test their game. It cost me $76 with the discount, which felt fair for the speed and complexity.

To my surprise, the essay landed in my inbox 20 minutes early. It was well-structured, cited properly (APA), and had zero AI or plagiarism issues (yes, I checked!). Not perfect—but definitely *submission-ready* after a quick once-over.

Bottom Line: Sites like Papersroo can be a *lifesaver* when time’s short and your brain’s fried. Just remember: don’t use them to cheat—use them to manage workload smarter. Oh, and don’t expect Hemingway for $10/page.

😂 *Bonus: The only thing it didn’t do was make me coffee… maybe in version 2.0?*
