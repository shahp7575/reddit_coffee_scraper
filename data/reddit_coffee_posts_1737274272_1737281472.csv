As it is shown on the chart, it is clear that people go to a café more than buying the coffee or tea. In the last 4 weeks, it is shown that on all five cities the percentage of buying instant coffee and going to café is much more than people buying fresh coffee. 
 
In Sydney nearly 45% of folks buy fresh coffee and in Melbourne over 40% consume the fresh coffee while in Hobart is closely 40%, in Brisbane and Adelaide is around 35% which puts then at the lowest percentage, However, in Hobart and Brisbane, city residents buy more of instant coffee than the fresh one which puts them at almost 55% while Sydney has the lowest percentage of approximately 45%.  
 
In all five cities the percentage of city residents going to a café is higher than other two, which place Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney on the highest percentage of over 60% consumers and Adelaide and Brisbane of the lowest percentage of residents, by Adelaide being nearly 50% and Brisbane at 55%.",1,1737281254.0,ieltswriting,0,1.0,False
1i4vc62,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1i4vc62/is_my_mom_neglectful_19f/,Is my mom neglectful? (19f),"I’m sorry if this breaks the rules but this crossed my mind recently and i’ve honestly been at a loss and need some advice. :( My mom is my legal guardian and is the only legal guardian in the household. I’m the second youngest of my six  siblings. Six of which that are constantly at work and hog the household keys. I’ll get into “hogging the keys” in a minute because it is a key part of this story. 


I guess the first question is like to start off with is if staying in a small room for 20 days straight is normal. I know it sounds bizarre but that has honestly been my reality for months now. I’m rarely granted the chance to leave my house and whenever i am able to it’s either for menial errands or whatever boring thing my mom wants me to do. I call it boring because it’s either going to the store or  to a random relatives house (trust me, it’s not as fun as you’d think.) I would just sit on the couch, almost lifeless and tired as she talks to her relative and chatters. That’s it 


that has legitimately been my reality (like i’ve said before) for years. We never do any fun activities. It’s just errands —> back to my personal jailed hell. I don’t remember the last time i’ve  ever went out and about and laughed, had fun, did something, just anything. I’m swear to god i’m not lying. 

She’s always gone. And because the other residents got the keys, i’m legimateky inable to leave my house. (Because there is nobody able to lock the door.) Let get into my room. It’s a small twin bed with a. small window and a closet. It’s a really small room. 23 hours a day im laying on my bed. I barely eat.


This isolation has left me with zero friends. I’ve lived like this for about 6-ish years now. I’ve never went to prom. When i scroll through insta stories and see people going to coffee shops, hanging out in carnivals, or just going to a museum, i want to cry. I wonder what it’s like. I’ve never done anything a normal teenager would have. I have told her my feelings and i do believe that she does understand a bit but she’s glued to her phone a like moth to a flame. 

Im so hungry. All of the time. I don’t remember the last time i’ve eaten breakfast. My depression and fatigue just gets really bad and i stay in my bed when there are days where there doesn’t seem to be a ton of options: like If there is it’s just menial fruit and bunch of condiments that don’t go together. I watch a lot of mukbang videos alone and stuff because i just crave a full meal sometimes (i kinda feel myself getting emotional typing this.) But it’s true.. 

I’ve told her how i’ve felt but the next day she just acts normal and whenever i’m crying in my pillow i hear her and my other siblings in the kitchen laughing and having fun and i feel like an outsider ailen who’s crazy 

I miss being young especially before the pandemic because even though i’d stay home usually for 2 weeks straight, i’d have to e ability for her to take me to the park and sometimes i could interact with the other kids there and i could fell the sun and touch the grass and play for an entire day and it was just so beautiful. I feel so pathetic because i feel like that’s a basic human right but it’s so foreign to me at this point 

I am aware that i an legal adult and i am in the process of getting my listened so hopefully i will be able to own a car and go out finallt and do things that i’d like, but staying in my jail for so long (my small ass room lol) i kind of lose my perception of time and stuff since i spend a lot of time in here

She was messaging me every morning, afternoon, night and wanting to call me a couple times a week. We went out on a first date it went great. Seen a movie, hit up the bookstore, had coffee and made out a bit before I left. She lived a couple hours away but I felt pretty good after the date. So we scheduled a second date for Saturday and continued my regular routine. Saturday roles around and she cancelled a couple hours before the date and wants to reschedule because she ""wasn't feeling good"". I agreed and asked what day she was thinking but got emotional an deleted my messenger. When I re installed it the next day and realized I couldn't see what she had messaged me I  just decided to give it another day before I responded. I couldn't see what she had said to me because it said message unavailable after re installing. I told her I couldn't see her message as I reset my phone. Anyways she was so mad that I didn't message her back within 2 days that she decided to end things saying ""It felt like you ghosted me and and that was the one thing I told you not to do."" It just seems like a lot. I know I shouldn't have ignored her but at the same time she was being really clingy. Am I totally in the wrong here? I did apologize and try to tell her how I was excited to see her and got upset when she cancelled last minute. Seems like I couldn't just take a couple days to relax.

I’m terribly sorry, that I have not written to you in quite some time. I hope you’re still employed in the factory, and that your occupation has not yet become eligible for drafting. Because the life in the trenches is not a life I wish upon anyone. We have about three or four days out of them and eight or nine in them. When we are out supposed to be resting, we have to go on working parties, digging graves or trenches, build fortifications, and any work needed. And no matter were we are, we are always under shell fire, so not much of rest anyway. Every day we can see more of their ships descending from the sky. If the other fronts are anything like ours, I fear that if the flowers of peace will ever be planted, it will be in soil spoiled by sulphur and blood. Lately the fighting has been incessant , the dead lay beyond our trenches, their extremities convulsively raised and contorted towards the sky like a dead forest. We wear our respirators almost constantly because of the awful smell of the dead. I’ll never get these sights out of my eyes, it will be an everlasting nightmare. If I live to come home, I’ll try to tell you all about it, because I cannot possibly express it in writing as words fail me. The things are indescribable.

Your loving Brother

Vurian





Carsius Prime, (Centarus Arm Sge Vul Quadrant).



Field Marshal Johannes Thorsson stood at the edge of the battle map, its flickering display painting him in shades of zircon and crimson. The lines of the front carved out of the landscape like scars. Sinuous and irregular their bulwarks extending seemingly without end in all directions but one, marking the frontline across the blasted terrain. The Cereus 62^(nd) army group had bled to hold their current ground, but the time for stalemate had passed. Now, the order had come the 62^(nd) had to pierce through to Lankensorn, force a spear through the ramparts and give the northern and eastern circumvallating forces a window to reconstitute and hopefully create their own breaches into the invaders lines. And tighten the noose further around the enemy forces bridgehead near Vergemler Steep. Captain Astrid Falkenholm of J Company, 105^(th) Ranger Battalion, approached with a brisk salute. She bore the drawn look of an officer who had spent weeks in the rain and mud, her once pristine uniform torn and stained with the grime of the trenches. Yet her eyes, still sharp as a predator’s, met the Field Marshal’s, with resolve.



\- “My lord Thorsson,” she began, her voice steady but taut with restrained frustration.



\- “Our scouts report the enemies have taken up additional positions on the Turmund Ridge and dug them self in deep. fortifications, earthworks, and heavy mortar positions. Our preliminary bombardments barely scratched them.”



Thorsson nodded, his expression as immovable as a stubborn ox.



\- “Ja. They are resourceful, got to give them that Falkenholm. And damn hard to dislodge once they manage to get them self's a footing. But we have to take the ridge!”



Astrid hesitated, her hands clenching behind her back.



\- “Permission to speak freely, sir?”



\- “You may.”



\-”The dead and wounded from yesterdays assault are still trickling down through our trenches towards the surgical FOB’s, I estimate about 35 000 casualities, I had to send parts of my company to assist with prioritisations and first aid ”



\- “We cannot repeat the failure at Harald’s Gate. If we march up that ridge head-on, the men will die in droves. Their forces have stood stalwart against all our attacks and they quickly adapt. Their incursions more precise and their counter attacks more ferocious. If we commit to yet a another massive direct assault, I fear we will lose more than men, we will lose hope in our ranks”



Thorsson raised a hand, silencing her without ire.



\-”I know, that you know, just as well as I do ,that our ongoing efforts and relentless attacks are not solely to try and gain ground and push their lines further back. We can give them no respite, no room to concentrate their forces. ”



Astrid felt a sharp cold wave of embarrassment and shame wash over her, she tensed her jaw as she fought back a blush creeping up her neck.  
  


The Field marshal walked over to one of the reinforced viewing ports of the command bunker and stared up at the low thick cloud cover that concealed the sky.



\- “I hope you don’t think, I do not see, Falkenhom? That you believe I would throw away our sons and daughters in a fool’s gambit?”

His voice, though calm, carried the unmistakable reverb of a commander who mourn every soldier lost under their command.



\-“Do not mistake necessary orders for callousness or blindness.”



Astrid’s hands fell to her sides and she slightly leaned forward as she, with a hint remorse in her tone, interjected.



\-”Forgive me My Lord, I choose my words poorly if they led you to believe, that the intent behind them was to convey any doubt in the motivations behind your orders and decisions. I only”



Thorsson turned and faced Astrid, his expression harbouring signs of a smile



\-”Any one of sane mind would question the fact that so many are sacrificed for so seemingly little ground. I can not fault you for this ”



\-”However we should count the stars for our luck, that we managed to force this conflict into one of static warfare and containment for as long as we have.”



\-“The Turmund Ridge will not fall to brute strength alone.”



\-”What I’m about to tell you is a warning order, I trust you with this information because you and your men will be asked to play a crucial role in the coming weeks, and you will need time to prepare.”



He gestured to the map, where new symbols flickered into place, markers of hidden mine entrances and forgotten tunnels revealed by scouting parties.



\- “Our forward engineers have found remnants of an ancient mining network beneath the ridge. The Lions men , for all their ingenuity, seem to be unaware of what lies below them. We shall use these tunnels to place charges beneath them.”



Astrids’s brow furrowed.



\-“A calculated risk, my lord. If the enemy discovers us?”



\-“They will not,” Torsson interrupted, his voice ironclad.



\-”I have personally overseen the selection of the men for the saboteur groups, once the charges are detonated we will unleash a cavalcade of violence, sung in by the roar of a million artillery shells! ”



Thorsson’s eyes rested for a moment on the piercing gaze of Falkenholm.



\-”I need J Company to, get across no man's land, unseen. Lay in wait, just out of range of our artillery, just beyond Hill 275. Once our artillery barrage begins, there will be a 5 minutes countdown, then Hill 275 will be excluded form the barrage. This will be your window to seize or destroy the mortars and machine gun positions on that hill. If J company manages to hold Hill 275 during the main assault, you will create a thin gap beyond Stumblers Hill and along Bloods Creek, for the 15^(th) Asanders Brigade and the 6^(th) Mechanised Division to approach and assault Turmund Ridge from, with significantly reduced estimated casualties.”



He paused for a moment placed his hands on the edge of the strategical planning table and lowered his head.



\-”Once you have taken the hill; Your main objective is to hold it and restrict the enemies ability to pin down the 6^(th) Mechanised and the 15^(th) Asanders Brigade. And if you do manage to capture any offensive equipment, I want you to try and create as much havoc within their lines as possible. But, and I mean this, Do not proceed any further or join the rest of the assault. There will be 2 Mechanised Divisions and 12 infantry brigades participating in this operation. You are my surgical instruments don’t let the tide of violence dull your edges. I have plenty of hammers and rocks, but few sharp knifes.”



She raised her right hand to her right eyebrow and in an almost mechanical movement, and saluted.



\-“I will see to the men”, Astrid exclaimed with a stringent voice



Thorsson nodded and haphazardly saluted back and added,



\-”Let me know if there is anything you will need.”

Astrid turned, and with rejuvenated seal left the command bunker.



Field Marshal Johannes Thorsson sat down to review the latest situation reports from the other theatres. He had been there, when the envoy had addressed the planetary council. The Envoy had spoken about unification, threat of human annihilation from aliens, and the divinity of their king, the Lion. All lies he was sure of it. When subjugation had been refused, their planetfall had been almost immediate. Johannes remembered being surprised at how the worlds regions, seemingly in a single breath, had managed forget all past squabbles and scramble their forces in a united effort try to contain the invaders. That was four years ago, an still no end to the war in sight. He did not want to admit it to himself but deep down, a kernel of doubt had sprung root. At this point it was impossible that the forces and resupplies making daily planetfall would not be reinforcements from a main force. Even so, how the expeditionary contingent could have sustained such warfare for such an extended period eluded his comprehension.



Was there any validity to the claims the envoy had made? , he thought to himself. Before quickly suppressing his doubts.



\-”They might have pushed this dog in to a corner, but they will soon become acutely aware of just how hard it can bite.” Thorsson said under his breath.









As Astrid made her way through the meandering trenches she was halted by a procession of wounded, slowly making their way back towards the forward surgical field hospital

solemnly she moved through the swaying and limping mass, it’s repeating ebbs and flows agitated only by the the occasional stretcher bearer teams frantic movements.

On her way though the procession towards one of the non arterial trench systems, she came a upon a small statued figure sitting towards the mud wall of the trench. His arm and hand stretched out as if he was waiting on someone to grab it.



Astrid’s purposivety normally unwavering, yielded. She took the grasping hand in hers, letting it rest as if it was a wounded dove in the palm of her hand. Slowly the head of the small statued figure rose. Revealing the mutilated face of a very young man. Both his eyes shot through, their torn remains now mixed with eyelashes and skin



\-”I’ lost my way, can you help me?”

The boy asked calmly



Astrid could see the markings left by the medic, “why had he been deemed ‘will not survive’ ”she thought to her self.



\- “ it’ts alright, son”



\-“I… I can’t see, Ma’am, Wi wi will, I need an operation”



\-”Poor boy, he doesn’t know he never will” she thought to her self.



From the far end of the trench section a large soldier carrying two large ammunition cases hastily rounded the corner , his steps teetering on running and leaning forward as if each step stopped him from falling over.



Astrid threw out her free arm and grabbed him by his shoulder.



His momentum almost pulling Astrid with him, as he tried to stop without losing his balance.

The soldier turned towards Astrid with an exasperate expression, that slowly turned into one of surprise.



\-“Take this man to the forward surgical field hospital, and make sure he gets treated!”



The large soldier looked at the wounded man, then back at Astrid. His gaze began rapidly shifting in an erratic pattern betraying the struggle between the thoughts in his head. Just as he was about to open his mouth to speak, Astrid cut him off.



\-”I understand, you already have orders. That's self evident, unless you are running around with ammunition cases for fun. If the field hospital is further away than where ever you are going with those boxes, then drop them of on the way.”



\-”Yes ma’am, ” the soldier replied sheepishly.



The soldier moved the Ammunition box from his left hand to under his right arm, and leaned down towards the wounded young man.



\- “I’m Thomas, you want to come with me? I’ll take you to the medics , and they can get you patched up. ” He asked with a soft voice.



The wounded soldier nodded.

And as and Astrid and Thomas helped him up he said:



\- “I’m Bernard, but my buddies call me Nard.”



The two men slowly made their along the trench.



\-”Why do they call you Nard?” Thomas asked.



\-”One time our Sergeant, got so mad at me, he forgot the first part of my name when he yelled at me. I guess it sort of stuck.”



\-”What did you do to get your sarge so mad?”



The two rounded the corner of the south end of the trench, Astrid stood still for a moment longer trying to hear the reply, but they were now to far away for her to hear much more than the melody of their speech on top of the wind, distant rumbling of engines and artillery.







There was an aura of unease in the company command post. They were all waiting, waiting on a specific date and time. But no one knew which time or day they where waiting on. J Company had now gone over their battle plans multiple times a day. They had made contingency plans for seemingly every possible situation and drilled every last scenario almost to the point of absurdity.

Astrid observed the member of her staff, some where pacing the room, or continually shifting in their chairs, others picked their nails or at some small piece of scab on their hands. Every one showed signs of being anxious, all except Private Julian Baumhauer. Built like an Oak and often just as stoic, that man could fall a sleep just about anytime, anywhere. Astrid would be lying if she didn’t say she was at least a little jealous of him. An hour earlier Astrid had been given the final order, in about 34 hours they were expected to be in position just beneath Hill 275. She had not told the rest of the company or her subordinates, she wanted them to get the opportunity to have tonight's supper with relative piece of mind. Astrid got up, and walked over to the small stove in the corner of the room to refill her coffee mug.

She slowly turned towards the room, while blowing on the coffee and carefully testing the heat with her lips.



Between her breaths as she continued blowing on the coffee, she announced to the room;



\-”In 15 minutes I want every Platoon and squad leader in here for orders, and before you ask. Yes! we’re doing this thing.”



The previous feeling of unease filling the room was quickly replaced by a sense of duty, and the commotion people moving with purpose.

Astrid stood still, slowly drinking her coffee as the chaos around her slowly settled into order. Eventually the only movement in the room was her arm as she moved the mug to and from her lips, in front of her stood 35 officers in silent anticipation. She sat the mug aside and pulled back the sleeve on her left arm with her middle- and ring finger, revealing her watch. Astrid’s eyes focused on the watch face for a moment before her eyes started trailing the second hand.



\-”The time is 17:32.15 now…… 17.32. 25 …….. now ”



Everyone in the room quickly turned their gaze from Astrid to their respective watches, as they continued to listen to her declaring the time.



Astrid Continued;



\-“17:32. 40 …… now, 17:33. 00 ……. Now. Does any one need additional time giving or are we all synced?”



\-”Good!”



\-” As you all know, we have been tasked with taking Hill 275, Our assault plays crucial part for the success of Operation Spetum. I was informed that our Field Marshal decided on that name earlier this week, quite fitting in my opinion”

The listeners nodded in agreement.



\-”Now, The enemy holds Hill 275, from now referred to as THE HILL, They are entrenched and have multiple fortified, short range artillery positions and Machine gun nests. Enemy strength is estimated to be company sized. Possibly a dedicated communications platoon as well, either on, or in very close proximity to THE HILL. It’s imperative that we cut any communication lines and capture any radio equipment. The trench systems just to the North and south of THE HILL are fortunately for us not directly connected with the entrenchments on THE HILL due to the steepness of its sides. There are however two Trenches leading up the hill from the east, or from behind THE HILL. These will be referred to as INDEX and MIDDLE, and we need to get a vantage point over these as soon as possible, once we have established our presence. Our Company’s main objective is to open up a safe gap along Bloods Creek for the forces storming Turmund Ridge to approach through. Us holding THE HILL will not completely remove the enemies ability to fire down Bloods Creek, but it will no longer be a shooting gallery. This means we will need to engage down into the trench systems and other firing positions, from our position. Hopefully with captured artillery. Once the main spearhead of our forces, that will be barrelling right into the centre of the enemy frontlines, has breached the second line of trenches. We will change our focus to give them supporting fire. If we are unable to hold The HILL ,we are to destroy as much of their equipment as possible and hinder their ability to utilize the position.”



\-”Now for some specifics. We depart tomorrow evening once the sun has set”



\-“Our approach will be veiled by the storm that is expected to hit tomorrow evening, with a little luck it will begin just after dark, giving us extra time to move slowly and hidden through the night. Then at 4:30 we have to be in position just beneath THE HILL. Once the first salvo of our artillery barrage is fired, the countdown begins. FIVE minutes, then our objective will be excluded from the barrage.



The rest of the barrage will continue for another 35 minutes, before switching over to a creeping barrage, marking the start of the main assault. This will give us a 35 minute window take the THE HILL. The quicker and quieter we can seize it, the greater the chance that we can await the approach of the main assault in relative peace.”



\-”Questions?”



A single hand rose form the group.



\-”Yes!”, Astrid said while nodding in the direction lieutenant with the raised hand.



\-” Will there be radio silence through out the, entirety of the operation?”, the lieutenant asked with a short brisk tone.



\-”Until we can be sure that they are aware of our presence, we will hold radio silence. Any communication between platoons will have to be done with runners in the meantime, if absolutely necessary. Any communication back to HQ will be done with RCP-Drones.”

Astrid scanned the room looking for any other raised hands or facial expressions that conveyed confusion.



\-”If there are no other questions, You are all dismissed. Now go and make sure the men are ready for tomorrow.”



A loud CLACK rang out as every pair of boots in the room smacked together in unison. Then the crowd of officers dispersed and left the room, synchronized like a flock of swimming ducks entering a lake from a narrow stream.





The next day evening, there was a bustling through out the trench systems. Every soldier, platoon and company seemed to have very pressing orders to attend to, and preparations to make.

J Company however stood as a cohesive unit, just waiting. For the last half hour the wind had been steadily picking up, and even thicker and darker clouds slowly moved in over the battlefield.

The winds were blowing perpendicular to the trench in which, J Company was waiting, insulating them from the biting chill of the wind. But it howled at them as it passed over the trench.

As every shadow grew with the setting of the sun, so did they dim. The cloud cover was so thick, that as the horizon still shifted through the colours of fire and blood. The ground had already been painted with the darkest of ink.

A hand was raised, and the Company proceeded to exit the trench in six columns. Through the night they battled the biting wind and occasional hail as they slowly made their way over the ravaged landscape, filled with wreckages, deep craters, pieces of barbed wire, and the torn bodies of those who had found their final resting place violently and sudden.

Some craters were so deep that they had to climb up their edges in pairs. The closer they got to the hill the slower they had to move, eventually resorting to crawling. Because the temperature had crept so low that the mud began to freeze making the ground crackle under their boots. Although the wind was still blowing so ferociously that all but the loudest of screams would be drowned out. They did not dare, risk a sudden lull in the storm betraying their approach.



Astrid’s entire body ached from the strain and cold. The cold steel on her rifle burning her chin as she tried resting her neck in between shuffles, as she crawled under a group of fallen logs. As she cleared the last log and looked up, their objective suddenly loomed over her barely visible in the dim light from the enemy encampments scattered and reflected against the low clouds and thin fog.



She looked back and quietly said to her platoon deputy.



\-”We’re here, tell the men to get them self in to position and ready. We are quite early so if they need some rest, now would be the time to try and get some.”



Grouped together in their platoons all of J Company, laid pressed against a half frozen mudbank, concealed from the Lion’s forces and shielded from the worst of the weather.



In an instance the horizon behind them lit up as if the clouds had ignited. Then came the roar, indescribably loud the hail of artillery fire came raining down all along the frontline. Plumes of mud, stone and fire spewed up like erupting volcanos. The explosions ripping apart the ground and and setting fortifications a blaze. In between the near constant and deafening explosions the screams of the next incoming shells was all that could be heard.



Private Wilkes, adjusted the strap of his helmet and clutched his rifle. He could feel his heart pounding, the thump in his chest almost visible through his uniform jacket. Just Beside him, Sergeant Lewis checked his wristwatch. The older man’s expression of grim determination, reinforced by his heavily scarred face.



\-”Two minutes ” Lewis growled, his voice rough like gravel.



Wilkes looked down along the mudbank most of the platoons were sporadically visible to as the fire raining down, illuminated the landscape. He could see their Company commander Capitan Falkenholm crouched down and looking just as intently at her wristwatch as his Sergeant.



\-”Thirty Seconds”



Everyone shifted around and secured their footing, leaned up towards the edge of the bank and stood in a stance reminiscent of a predator ready to pounce.



\-”Ten seconds.. seven, six ……. four, three, two”



”Move! Move! Move!” Astrid barked as the barrage crept away from the THE HILL. The men leaped over the edge of the bank, weapons ready.

The climb was brutal from the outset. The ground was a morass of half frozen mud, jagged rocks and boulders . And the wind carried flakes of razor sharp snow, that cut in to their faces. The first obstacle was the barbed wire, stretched in stacked lines across the slope. Explosions from the barrage had torn gaps in some places, but in others, the wire remained intact, a deadly barrier.



”Wire cutters, up front!” Sergeant Lewis shouted, his voice cutting through the chaos.



Corporal Larsen darted forward, his hands working frantically as he snipped at the wire. The sharp twang of severed strands was drowned out by the barrage still hammering all along the front. As Lewis and the men of his platoon made their way through the rows of barbed wire, other parts of the company had, had better luck with the artillery clearing their paths. And some of them where already half way up the slope and had began fanning out. Just as Lewis got clear of the barbed wire, he could see that Falkenholm had stopped about half way up The Hill and was frantically signalling with her hands. A runner came stumbling down towards them, sliding and hopping down the muddy hill side.







\-”There are firing positions in the hill side! They have dug out, the whole hill might have tunnels,Captain wants your and 5^(th) platoon to breach and clear from the inside while the rest of us continue clear THE HILL from the top! ”. The runner exclaimed while trying to catch his breath



Sergeant Lewis nodded and turned to his platoon.



\-”Alright boys, looks like we are going caving, on me!” Sergeant Lewis said with his raspy voice.



Just as Astrid turned to continue the ascend there was a crack followed by the zip of bullets as a machine guns opened fire.

”Down! Find cover!” Astrid bellowed.

She threw herself into a shell crater as a burst of fire kicked up dirt near her face. She dared a glance over the edge, spotting the muzzle flashes from a machine gun nest partially concealed behind sandbags.



\-”Baumhauer!” Astrid yelled. “Take it out!”



Private Julian Baumhauer, nodded grimly. Clutching a grenade, he dashed forward , darting between cover, the machine gun crackling as it tracked him. A round clipped his thigh, and he stumbled but didn’t stop. With a roar, he hurled the grenade into the nest before collapsing behind a boulder. The explosion sent debris and bodies flying, silencing the gun.



\-”Push on!” Astrid screamed.



As they advanced, they encountered the first artillery position: a pair of short-barreled howitzers nestled together in a concrete emplacement. The gunners, stunned by the barrage and the sudden appearance of infantry, reached for their rifles too late. On top of the Hill there was obvious signs of confusion among the enemy. Some were running to re-man their positions, while others frantically tried to get in side of their bunker entrances again to respond to the fighting now raging inside their tunnels. In the chaos and confusion a moment of respite appeared for Astrid, to survey the situation.



\-”Fuck. Matthews! Where’s Baumhauer?” Astrid shouted while hastily looking back and forth over the parapet surrounding the artillery position.



\-”He got hit while clearing the machine gun position Ma’am, Forseti is tending to him they’re still on the hill side.” Mathews replied.



\-”This is taking to long, we need to cut off those who have managed to get them self into defensible positions from reinforcements. And force the rest of them into the bunker system. By the sounds of it 2^(nd) and 5^(th) are wreaking havoc down there. Any one trying to escape we can cut down by setting up firing positions there and there. Two machine gun groups would be able to hold those entrances. That will free up most of 3^(rd) ,4^(th) and 6^(th) can set up defensive positions looking over INDEX and MIDDLE.”



\-”Yes Ma’am ”





\-”Wilkes, On me! Get this thing loaded!”

Wilkes scrambled to help Lewis in the dimly lit corridor, his hands trembling as he armed and shoved a shell into the breech of the Sergeants shoulder fired grenade rifle. The gun roared, its shell slamming a hole through the wall as the round obliterated the hastily constructed machine gun position, at the far en of the corridor, in a spray of smoke and shrapnel.

The defenders firing desperately to hold the line. Machine guns roaring, rifle fire snapped and ricochets bouncing of walls with high pitched tangs, around the advancing men. The final push was a bloody and grueling melee. Eventually the intensity of the fighting gradually died down, the further up the bunker system they came. The sustained adrenaline secretion and stress had Wilkes in tears as he forced his trembling body past yet another corner. A bullet whizzed past his head and he threw him self on the ground. A familiar voice shouted in the distance



\-”Wilkes! Is that you?”



\-”Yes! It’s me. Hold your fire”, he replied with a trembling voice.



\-”You bastards, you made it!”, the voice replied



\-”Now get up here, The main act is about to begin.”



Wilkes collected him self and got up of the bloodstained concrete floor. His Sergeant, Sergeant Lewis padded him on his shoulder as the remainder of 2^(nd) Platoon made their way up the stairs.



Hill 275 was now firmly in the hands of J Company, yet the battle was just about to begin.

1i4v3dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i4v3dq/aitah_for_feeling_i_need/,AITAH for feeling I need ,"AITA for feeling I need more from my man?
I (35,F) and my husband (37, M) have been married for 6.5 years, and have 2 daughters, aged 1 and 6 yo. MM pay of our marriage has been me going back and forth to his home country in West Africa because during the pandemic when our eldest was 2 he decided to leave the country which terminated his green card paperwork. He also quit school and lost his student visa. I had already accepted my first post-doctoral position when he left, which was remote but required me to be some where in the US. Thankfully my boss allowed me to work abroad occasionally throughout the 4 years. During this time I became pregnant and decided to have the child in the US. I was left with no spousal support but thankfully my mom was around to help. My husband met his second daughter when she was 6months old. This was very hard for me but apparently is normal in his culture. My husband is very cold emotionally which happened when I was pregnant the first time. We had only been dating several months before the pregnancy but he didn’t seem to be this cold until I became pregnant. He blames it on me though saying he can’t show mice any affection, which includes looking at me with a smile, unless everything is calm and perfect. But I was stressed as I was a struggling grad student and basically had to figure everything out on my own including new housing and insurance stuff. My student health insurance did not cover children and we were living in a shared house with four other room mates, which was not very kid friendly. I also didn’t want to disrupt anyone’s life as they were all either in graduate school or working professionals. But it caused extra stress on me. 

But this is just all background to the real question. So fast forward to now, four years later: my contract ended and because I was at home with our second baby I was barely able to even finish my workload let alone look for another job. My husband finally got his green card. But now the issue is that he is the sole income earner and I from his home country. He doesn’t want to use his degree or work in the US. So we moved back to his home country with intentions to stay. It is a developing country and I don’t speak any of the languages here. I’m trying to learn French and can speak a bit but can’t really follow conversations so I’m constantly confused and feeling left out and alone. I’m constantly uncomfortable. But I thought at least being here, at least trying he would be warmer to me. Whenever I express this he either tells me he is uncomfortable with showing affection and/or laughs at me which just hurts me even more. I realized today that he hasn’t even met me halfway because I remember how uncomfortable he was in the US and how he refused to go out with me. I know how he feels because I also don’t like going out in his home country because I am uncomfortable. Sometimes the only white (Hispanic=white here), English speaking person. So I get it! But the difference is I’m trying. Except yesterday I just couldn’t push myself, I just wanted alone time, to relax and not get a headache from the ""kids"" party which was just too loud for me. So add being uncomfortable plus auditory discomfort, which I struggle with. I also have social anxiety and it takes a lot out of me to force myself into social situations even in the US. So I refused to go and just listen to my body which was telling me to rest. I just didn’t have the energy nor the composure to endure feeling lonely in a loud room of people. 

This morning I felt attacked because I said maybe I should have pushed myself to stay but my body was not good. I want to cut out meat from my diet which is hard here because they eat so much meat but I know it hurts me. I had also washed my yoga mats and started to exercise. So I’m trying to put more veggies in my diet and exercise more. I know this helps with my energy level and stress. I’m prone to migraines and headaches. So I started the day off with some light stretching and a spinach pineapple-mango smoothie. But I also wanted a hug and kiss from my husband. I don’t think this expectation is out of the ordinary but he refused to look at me with a soft face. I’ve told him his body language always makes me feel like he doesn’t love or even like me. But he refuses to change. He told me I was making excuses about why I felt bad yesterday and I should just change my diet and exercise more. I just didn’t want to hear it. I wanted to enjoy my oats, smoothie, and coffee. But I felt my traps start to tighten and a headache coming on. I asked if he wasn’t willing to put himself in uncomfortable situations like showing his wife affection, which I honestly find hurtful that that makes him uncomfortable, why should I put myself in uncomfortable situations like being here in the first place? I have now resolved to leave as soon as I can secure a job somewhere and de-center my life away from him and really any other man. So AITA for wanting to get out? I kinda feel like the A-hole because I put my trust in a man and feel defeated as a woman who hold 2 phds and always took pride in my independence. Would I be the A-hole if I stayed? I need strangers input specifically those in marriages or relationships with those from different cultural and racial backgrounds. How should I proceed? I’m very torn because we have 2 daughters together and he is a good dad to them. He actually showers them with affection constantly. Which also hurts me that he can’t extend that sort of physical love to me. But honestly if it hadn’t of been for me making sure his children had a relationship with their father I really doubt he would have stepped up as he was very cold to them at first too and had no problem not being in their lives before. So internet, please advise or admonish. But please be kind and respectful. Also sorry for the long post.",1,1737280131.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I made a medium light Christmas blend from a local roaster with notes of chocolate and cinnamon. While those notes are rater genetic I already had some pretty nice cinnamon shine through in the past. However with this big batch it completely lacked those and also had a slight bitterness (even though I seemed to be the only one noticing it).

It's pretty obvious to me that I overextracted the coffee and have to go even coarser and lower the temperature. 

My parameters were:

Ratio: 50g coffee / 850g of water (1:17)
Water temperature: 92°C
Grind size: 90 clicks on K6
Bloom: 1:00 (didn't intend to bloom for so long but got distracted)
Total brew time: 4:40

Since I rarely brew this much at once it's hard to make many iterations to improve.  
What I would try if I'd repeat this amount and coffee:

Ratio: 50g coffee / 850g of water (1:17)
Water temperature: 90°C
Grind size: 105 clicks on K6
Bloom: 0:30
Total brew time: Maybe 3:30 - 4:00. (A bit longer brew time with a Chemex is okay in my opinion and it's probably hard to get 850ml through in sub 3:00 while having no bypass)

What do you think? Or not try with that much at all and brew something more concentrated with a V60 and dilute afterward (bypass brewing). ",1,1737278939.0,pourover,2,0.67,False

But only on Sundays.
The one day I will allow myself.
One day of lingering in the limerance.

It doesn't matter what I do that day.
Busy morning of bouncy steps, bubbly smiles, and brunch happiness.
Or lazy days wrapped in sheets, cats, and daydreams.
It still manages to come back to you.

Do you think of me?
Do you miss the glances over the cluttered counter?
The jokes about how you cook and I just watch.
""Why you staring at me?!"" ""Cause I like watching you do your thing""

Light-hearted banter about anything and everything.
Spices and steam rising in the air.
Almost as fast as the blush rushing to our cheeks.
Careful about how close we get, what we said out loud.

We just started a routine, you see.
Something I got hooked onto so easily.
It was comfort in a person.
And I really wanted to explore the depths.

Dinner with friends.
Alone quality time.
Constant texting.
Even with the crazy adult life.

I craved more.
Not physically. 
Well maybe...
But I wanted the soul.

I wanted to dive into those stormy eyes.
Delve into the darkest parts.
And anchor myself there.
Wrapping around the Pandoras's box of feelings. 

Let our demons dance together.
So maybe, just maybe
That pain you tried to hide
Wouldn't feel so heavy.

I understand why you went quiet.
I do it, too.
Get lost in the chaos of our own mind
And let the whirlwind consume.

The quiet focus on survival.
Grinding away the days to get somewhere better.
Healing behind a mask.
But I admit, I miss our Sundays.

Have a coffee for me one day.
Reminisce on hazel eyes,
Shy touches, and comfortable quiet.
Know that they still share Sundays with your stormy blues.

1i4usvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop_uncensored/comments/1i4usvl/why_didnt_apt_translate_into_success_for_rosie/,Why Didn’t APT Translate Into Success for Rosie?,"

Rosé’s album had great results but it doesn’t really feel like she was piggybacking off of one of the biggest hits this year. The streams for her singles were decent but it was almost like APT was never released. None of them ever hit 4 million daily streams iirc. Mantra and New Woman performed pretty similarly despite no huge song preceding. APT should’ve been her breakout into the West but it has seemingly had little impact on her album performance.

So my question is: why? She was in a really good place: large fandom, hit song, lots of promo, and a safe album in English. 

Some may argue that the tone of Rosé’s album was too different to APT but it’s seems like her solo streams were fandom-carried from the start. I do think she would have performed a bit better if her album was more in the style of GUTS by Olivia Rodrigo, releasing a pop-rock hit followed by ballads isn’t the wisest idea. However, I don’t think her album was as boring as some have suggested. When I saw reviews, I was expecting an album far more slow and minimally produced than it actually was. None of her songs felt like Taylor Swift to me apart from Two Years.

As for the album itself, I enjoyed it but it doesn’t have much replay value for me. All the songs were pretty good but there was never a point where I wanted to immediately add a song to my playlists. Drinks of Coffee and APT are the only songs I stream. I believe she was limited by her stylistic choices. I’m not a professional vocalist or anything but she sounded like she was straining in a few songs and couldn’t really belt or produce a climax high note. There were moments where I felt like she was fighting between cursive-singing and singing with clarity. This kind of limits her ballads for me as they don’t feel as hard hitting and sound a bit grating at times. ",0,1737278818.0,kpop_uncensored,8,0.48,False

1i4urbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampingandHiking/comments/1i4urbf/annapurna_base_camp_trek_faq_everything_you_need/,Annapurna Base Camp Trek - FAQ - Everything you need to know -  from a Trekking Guide in Nepal ,"Hello once again my fellow hikers, as I still see a lot of queries regarding the Annapurna Base Camp hiking in Nepal, as an independent trekking guide operating in Nepal, here are my pointers for your perusal. This article is divided into subsections and hence you can directly jump over to whichever information you are looking for. The goal of this article is to provide you with enough information so that you can undertake this trek independently or if you are looking to have more details of the trek for your planning. Thank you for taking your time to go through the information and happy hiking.

**Introduction**

Annapurna Base Camp trek you to the heart of Annapurna Himalayas where you would have magnificient views of the Annapurna ranges and the majestic Fishtail (Macchapuchre) mountain. Nowadays, the trek can be easily completed in 6 Days starting from Pokhara and ending at Pokhara. It is a perfect beginner friendly trek and since the highest elevation is at 4200 metres, there are minor risks of High Altitude Sickness. However, I have observed no of people getting down with Altitude Sickness if they try to push themselves too hard or ascent too fast due to time constraints or personal reasons. It is a perfect starter to the multi day hiking adventure in the Himalayas. The teahouses are well equipped and you can expect creature comforts of hot showers, internet service, electricity, freshly brewed coffee, etc in this trek. By this account, it is still a challenging hike if you don't have a lot of experience hiking and somedays can be pretty demanding. Let's dwelve into the details of the hike starting with:

**Transportation**  
Our journey generally starts from Pokhara. One can hire a private jeep from Pokhara to get to Jhinu which is the last vehicle point of the trek. The cost of single jeep hire ranges from 50-60 USD and hence, if you are in a group of 2-4, this is an ideal way of getting to the trail head. Alternatively, you can also get a shared jeep from Harichowk of Pokhara or Baglung Bus Park, where you can expect to pay about 10-15 USD per person. Mind you, some shared jeeps/buses doesn't go exactly upto Jhinu and diverts mid way to go towards Ghandruk, so you have to essentially get off at the junction and hike for about an hour to get to Jhinu.

**Permits**  
If you are trekking independently, you can acquire FIT Permits from the Nepal Tourism Board Office at [Kathmandu ](https://g.co/kgs/J2nw2PQ)or [Pokhara](https://g.co/kgs/L31LPmz). You have to be present in person, fill up a form with your details, mention Nayapool as an Entry and End Point of the trek, submit the form along with the photocopy of your passport, 2 p.p. size photographs and NRs. 3000. The staffs at NTB would process your forms and hand you the ACAP Permits within 10-15mins. This Permit is all you need to traverse around the majestic Annapurna region and works as a single entry permit. You will be required to submit this permit at the checkpost at Birethanti (after Nayapul) and/or at Chomrong. You will also be required to present the permit during the exit and hence I suggest you to hold onto them till you are back at Pokhara.

**Teahouses and Amenities**  
Annapurna Base Camp trek is laiden with decent teahouses with the creature comforts mentioned above. The food choices are abundant and unless you are going there in high season or peak tourist season, you don't have to worry about not finding Accommodations. Having said that, I have seen quite a no of independent trekkers who arrived in peak season and had to settle for Dining Halls due to lack of rooms. Also, unlike other trekking destinations, the teahouses in ABC route doesn't have firewood heater to keep the rooms warm. Hence, depending on the times of the year, it is advised to carry warm clothes to wear after your arrival at the teahouses.

All the teahouses have hot shower facilities and some even have laundry services. You can expect to pay about NRs. 200 for the Hot Gas Shower and as for the 6-7 days of trek, there would be minimal requirement of laundry services.

**Hydration/Food**  
One of the most blaring questions is of hydration. There are no provisions of bottled water beyond Chomrong and hence, I suggest you to bring a Nalgene Bottle and use Steripen or Water Purification Tablets that you can purchase at Thamel. Alternatively, you can also buy Filtered/Boiled water from the teahouses. However, given your requirement of 3-4 litres daily and the cost of NRs. 150 per litre to NRs. 200 per litre, it can add up quite fast. Hence, I suggest you to bring your own water filtration such as Steripen, Sawyer Filter or Water Purification Tablets.

The food situation is quite good on the trails as there will be plenty of options. I haven't encountered anyone with serious cases of food poisoning so far. The meat products are not available beyond the place called 'Bamboo'. However, I would suggest you refraining from meat products when you are hiking altogether just to be on the safe side.

**Connectivity and Electricity**  
Annapurna Base Camp is well connected with Internet Access all the way to the basecamp. The cellphone connectivity is until Machapuchre Base Camp (MBC) with 4G Connectivity. The internet comes from Fibre Optic connectivity. However, they would ask for additional NRs. 150 - NRs. 200 to use the Internet services, should you require once you reach higher elevations.

Each of the teahouses/camps have their own micro hydropower plant and hence, unless you are staying at the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) or Machapuchre Base Camp (MBC), these two are the only places without electricity and rely on Solar Power.

**Itinerary and Add Ons**  
This is a rough guide to how I plan my treks to Annapurna Base Camp generally.

* Day 1 - Pokhara to Jhinu (By Jeep) and Hike to Chomrong
* Day 2 - Chomrong to Dovan
* Day 3 - Dovan to Deurali
* Day 4 - Deurali to Annapurna Base Camp
* Day 5 - Annapurna Base Camp to Bamboo
* Day 6 - Bamboo to Jhinu and Jeep back to Pokhara

Day 1 - We would start after our breakfast (8-9am) and get on the jeep heading towards Jhinu. The journey would take about 3 hours and we would show our permits at the checkpost in Birethanti. As we reach Jhinu, we would prepare ourselves for the hike, cross a long suspension bridge and begin a rather steep ascent to Chomrong. This would take another 2-3 hours in an average pace and can be completed under 2 hours for a moderately paced hiker. Since we would still be in lower elevations, the conditions are quite hot and humid during the hike, followed up by the chill/cold evening at Chomrong.

Day 2 - We start fairly early from **Chomrong**, depending on the time of the year between 7 am to  am. We do so to avoid the ascend of **Upper Sinuwa** in the blaring afternoon sun. There is another checkposts at Chomrong where we enter our permits and off we go downhill for about an hour to be greeted with a suspension bridge. As we cross the beautiful suspension bridge, our steep ascent to **Upper Sinuwa** begins. It might take about 2 hours to reach Upper Sinuwa where we generally take a longer 15-20mins break, have some tea admiring the views. The trail becomes more easier and flatter after Upper Sinuwa and after another hike and a descent we reach **Bamboo**, where we will have our lunch. Generally, we aim to have our lunch between 12-1 pm for an early morning start of 7 am. After our lunch, the trail goes through a slight ascent finally we reach **Dovan** after about 1-1.5 hour of hike after Bamboo.

Day 3 - From **Dovan** to **Himalaya**, it is a pretty accessible trail until we reach a beautiful waterfall after the hike for about 1-1.5 hour.  From the waterfall, our ascent begins for another 1-1.5 hour till we reach the place called Himalaya. This is our lunch place for the day and please don't forget to have some Pizza on this place for which it is quite known for. After lunch, we begin a gradual ascent to Hinku Caves for about 2 hours and another 40 mins of hiking would bring us to **Deurali.**

Day 4 - Another early start to the day, the trails are failry accessible with moderate ascent until we reach **Machapuchre Base Camp(MBC)**. The valley opens up and you would be greeted with the awe-inspiring views of the entire Annapurna Himalayas. It takes about 2-3 hours for modertalely paced hikers to reach MBC where we would take a small tea break. Then another 2-3 hours of uphill ascent would bring us to the fabled **Annapurna Base Camp (ABC)**. Today we will have our lunch at Annapurna Base Camp spend time inside the teahouse awaiting the beautiful sunset at ABC. We wil have an early dinner likely 6-7pm and fall asleep to wake up early for one of the most wonderful sunrise at about 5:30am depending upon the time of the year.

Day 5 - After we soak in the scenery, we will have a rather early breakfast in about 6:30-7am and start our preparations to go back down. We bid farewell to the ABC and begin our rather long day to get back down all the way to **Bamboo**. On a good pace, we would have our lunch at Himalaya and reach Bamboo by 2-3 pm. However, for average pace, it might take 1-2 hours longer. I have had clients where they were exceptionally fast paced and we managed to get back down all the way to **Lower Sinuwa or Chomrong** at some instances. But, for regular hikers, this is a perfect place to call it a night and take on the journey next day.

Day 6 - As we begin our journey back to **Jhinu**, we would have our lunch at **Chomrong**. Today would also be a rather long day and suggest you to start early. It takes about 1.5 hour from Bamboo to Upper Sinuwa and another 2-3 hours from Upper Sinuwa to Chomrong. We will stamp our permits again at Chomrong. After lunch, we descend to Jhinu (1.5 hours) and get on the jeep to head over to Pokhara, again exiting the ACAP Checkpost at Birethati on the way.

This is the overall summary of the 6 days itinerary. Now, as far as the concerns for **Altitude Sickness** goes, you would have to be vigilant from **Deurali (3300metres).** Some decide to stay at **MBC (3700m)** and decide to take a early morning hike to **ABC (2hours).** However, I prefer to head over to ABC and fortunately, all of my clients have been fine and/or only presented mild symptoms of Altitude Sickness like Headache. However, pertaining to your conditions, you can make your own judgement on what fits you the best.

**Add Ons**  
Now onto the add ons for this itinerary, you can also continue to head towards Annapurna Sanctuary trek after returning back to Chomrong. Instead of continuing onto Jhinu, you can have an itinerary like this:

Day 6 - Bamboo to Chomrong  
Day 7 - Chomrong to Tadhapani  
Day 8 - Tadhapani to Ghorepani  
Day 9 - Early Morning hike to Poonhill (1.5 hours, back to Ghorepani (45mins) and hike to Birethanti (3 hours) and Jeep to Pokhara (3 hours)

OR

Day 9 - Hike to Poonhill - Back to Ghorepani (Breakfast) and Hike to Tatopani (Shikha)  
Day 10 - Tatopani to Pokhara (By Bus or Jeep) - 4 hours

In my opinion, if you have the time I suggest you to hike down to Tatopani from Ghorepani. Technically, you will come across a small town called Pokharebagar from which you can take a taxi (NRs. 500) to Tatopani. It is famous for its natural hot springs and actually a perfect way to end your trek. However, if you dont have the time or doesn's suit you on the budget, you can end your hike at Day 9 and take the jeep back to Pokhara from Birethanti.

Please bear in mind that the jeep access to Birethanti or Jhinu might be blocked in monsoon seasons or periods of heavy rainfall and hence plan accordingly.

**Gears and Equipments**

Hiking Tshirts - 2  
Hiking Trousers and Shorts - 2/1  
Thermal Base Layer - 1 Pair  
Goretex Windproof/Waterproof Shell (Top and Bottom) - 1 pair  
Underwear and Socks - As preferred (3-4)

Sleeping Bag - 1 (Depending upon the time of the year)

Gloves and Beanie - 1/1  
Trekking Shoes - Preferably Mid ankle height  
Trekking Poles - As Preferred

Head Torch  
Toilet Paper, Hand Sanitizer and Wet Tissues  
Water Filtration System (Sawyer or Steripen)  
Water Purification Tablets (Aqua Tabs)  
Nalgene Bottle (1ltr) or Hydration Bladder or both

**Cost**  
The age old important question of how much this might cost you to do this trek. Apart from the obvious cost of permits, transportations, etc you can expect to spend about 30-50USD per day for your Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and Accommodation along with some extras such as Hot Shower, Phone Charge or Internet services. There are trekkers who have done this trek in really small budget as well but it all depends on your dietary habits and preferenes.

Along with that, you can expect to pay about **30-50 USD** for an experienced trekking guide depending on his/her experience, qualifications, communication skills, group size, etc and about **15-20 USD per day for the Trek Assist (Porter Services).**

**Conclusion**  
Hopefully, this article was meaningful to assist you for the wonderful Annapurna Base Camp trek and left you with enough information to do it independently if you deem so. I haven't gone into full details of the landscape and the views as I would like you guys to be mesmerized upon your encounter to the beautiful himalayas.

After listening to Andrew Huberman and Peter Attia, here’s the general guideline they suggest:
Cardio: A couple of hours a week.
Resistance training: 2-3x a week.
HIIT: ~30 minutes a week.

My View:
Cardio: Based on the CDC, 75-150 minutes of cardio is more than enough to get most of the cognitive benefits from exercise. This doesn’t necessarily involve jogging or running, Type 2 cardio, like fast walking, is sufficient for optimal results.

Resistance Training: The benefits of resistance training are mostly related to boosting testosterone, IGF-1, and increasing BDNF. For testosterone, low and high levels seem to be the most problematic. A study shows that having moderate testosterone levels is the most beneficial for fluid intelligence, while high testosterone is known to reduce spatial and non-verbal intelligence. Increasing IGF-1 is beneficial for kids below the age of 10 but isn’t particularly helpful for adults. As for BDNF, most of it is produced during cardio. Meditation and even drinking coffee can also increase BDNF.

HIIT: There’s no unique benefit HIIT provides that cardio doesn’t, except when it comes to improving VO2 max. However, VO2 max is already highly correlated with resting heart rate, and training specifically for it won’t make you any better at cognitive tests.

Exercise offers several benefits, such as hippocampal neurogenesis, BDNF boost, and increased neuroplasticity, which are mostly achieved through 75-150 minutes of Type 2 cardio (fast walking) which most of us get indirectly through daily activities.

Resistance training can be useful later in life (near retirement) to prevent sarcopenia or osteoporosis, but beyond that, it’s not very beneficial, especially not HIIT.",0,1737278134.0,minimalism,4,0.25,False

Learn to appreciate the food culture. Learn to ditch packaged and junk craps and start to learn how bread is made and make it yourself. Learn to make food like a part of your culture, learn to eat slowly and respect the food(see the french and italians)learn to appreciate every small bite. If you don’t have time just cook a lot of food on the weekend in batch and freeze it, it’s all worth worth it trust me. I myself did the same and lemme tell you: i still eat lasagna(i make at home), i still sometimes eat a burger if i am going out and it’s offered by somebody. I don’t need to obsess over a cheat day and eat my whole weeks calorie in one day and feel guilty.

 Eat everything but please make it regular to eat homecooked food. Trust mehealthy food is much tastier once you start learning how to cook( i am amazed so many people aren’t taught this basic skill), there are so many ethnic foods that are way tastier than fast food craps( they have so many exotic spices and stuff), even grilling veggies with salt herbs etc. is better than boiling them. Diitch that processed corn flakes and eat a banana(natures snack) and yogurt, etc.

Last but not the least: DRINK WATER! don’t have any sodas at home so you don’t drink them. I personally dont even drink coffee or tea( i have caffeine sensitivity but you can drink it no problem). JUST WATER. I am amazed so many people keep saying water isn’t tasty, you don’t need it to be tasty to hydrated when your tired, ITS A BASIC THING to give it to your system. And make sure to drink 2liters of water to keep your system functioning properly.

After i did the same i have seen so many outcomes. I feel energetic, my acnes are gone(finally!), i can sleep better, people told me i lost a lot of love handles( yes they are so annoying huh), my bloating and constipation is gone.

Bowled sides and quite a wide flat base, any idea of where to get such cup as it was lovely for a flat white style drink. I didn’t see it on their stuff for sale shelf, and it was too busy to bother the disinterested teen on the till. 

This was a UK Starbucks as when it comes to flat whites, geography and hell even between coffee shops the swing in size and taste is wild. ",1,1737277906.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

But only on Sundays.
The one day I will allow myself.
One day of lingering in the limerance.

It doesn't matter what I do that day.
Busy morning of bouncy steps, bubbly smiles, and brunch happiness.
Or lazy days wrapped in sheets, cats, and daydreams.
It still manages to come back to you.

Do you think of me?
Do you miss the glances over the cluttered counter?
The jokes about how you cook and I just watch.
""Why you staring at me?!"" ""Cause I like watching you do your thing""

Light-hearted banter about anything and everything.
Spices and steam rising in the air.
Almost as fast as the blush rushing to our cheeks.
Careful about how close we get, what we said out loud.

We just started a routine, you see.
Something I got hooked onto so easily.
It was comfort in a person.
And I really wanted to explore the depths.

Dinner with friends.
Alone quality time.
Constant texting.
Even with the crazy adult life.

I craved more.
Not physically. 
Well maybe...
But I wanted the soul.

I wanted to dive into those stormy eyes.
Delve into the darkest parts.
And anchor myself there.
Wrapping around the Pandoras's box of feelings. 

Let our demons dance together.
So maybe, just maybe
That pain you tried to hide
Wouldn't feel so heavy.

I understand why you went quiet.
I do it, too.
Get lost in the chaos of our own mind
And let the whirlwind consume.

The quiet focus on survival.
Grinding away the days to get somewhere better.
Healing behind a mask.
But I admit, I miss our Sundays.

Have a coffee for me one day.
Reminisce on hazel eyes,
Shy touches, and comfortable quiet.
Know that they still share Sundays with your stormy blues.

- **Toaster:** A toaster is a quick way to prepare breakfast or snacks. Choose one that fits your kitchen style.
- **Coffee Maker:** If you love coffee, a simple coffee maker can make mornings much brighter.

### Cleaning Supplies

With all this cooking, you’ll need cleaning supplies to keep your kitchen in shape. Here are some essentials:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-starter-kitchen-set

Remember, a well-stocked kitchen not only fosters creativity but also makes meal preparation a joyful activity. So take your time to choose wisely, and soon you'll be on your way to becoming a confident home cook!

Tips for Choosing the Right Kitchen Tools for Beginners
-------------------------------------------------------

Choosing the right kitchen tools is essential for any beginner. Whether you’re moving into your first home or simply looking to upgrade your collection, having the right equipment can make a world of difference. Here are some valuable tips to help you pick kitchen tools that suit your needs.

First and foremost, consider what types of cooking you enjoy or would like to explore. Are you excited about baking, sautéing, or perhaps grilling? Your interests will guide you in selecting specific utensils that align with your culinary goals. For example, if baking catches your fancy, look for quality baking sheets, measuring cups, and a sturdy mixing bowl.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-starter-kitchen-set  
  
Another important factor is quality versus quantity. As a beginner, you might feel tempted to purchase a wide array of tools, but starting with a few high-quality items is more beneficial. Durable tools will perform better and last longer, ultimately saving you money in the long run. Here are some fundamental kitchen tools that everyone should consider:

- **Chef’s Knife:** A versatile kitchen essential for chopping, slicing, and dicing.
- **Cutting Board:** Choose a sturdy board that can withstand knife movements without dulling them.
- **Measuring Cups and Spoons:** Precision is key in cooking and baking.
- **Mixing Bowls:** Having various sizes caters to different tasks.
- **Non-stick Pan:** Ideal for easy cooking and cleaning.
- **Spatula:** Useful for flipping and serving food.

When selecting these tools, ensure they feel comfortable in your hands. If a tool is awkward or heavy, it may discourage you from using it. Take the time to test out a few options at a local store or read reviews before investing in anything. Comfort is key in making the cooking process enjoyable rather than cumbersome.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-starter-kitchen-set  
  
As you build your kitchen collection, think about versatility. Opt for tools that can serve multiple purposes. For instance, a good whisk can be used for mixing ingredients, beating eggs, or even making salad dressings. Tools that can adapt to your cooking style will save space and money.

Don’t overlook the importance of storage. Consider where you will keep your tools and how often you will use them. Ideally, keep the essentials easily accessible. For rarely used items, find a suitable storage solution that doesn’t clutter your kitchen. Wall-mounted racks or drawer organizers can be good ways to keep things neat and tidy.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-starter-kitchen-set  
  
It’s also wise to think about your budget. You don't need to spend a fortune to equip your kitchen. Many affordable brands produce high-quality tools. Watch for sales and shop during holiday seasons to score great deals. Purchasing a starter kitchen set may also provide a cost-effective way to gather multiple tools at once.

Remember that practice makes perfect. Don't be afraid to experiment with your kitchen tools. The more you use them, the better you will become at cooking. Even if you make mistakes, those experiences will teach you valuable lessons that cannot be found in recipe books.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-starter-kitchen-set  
  
To wrap it up, starting your kitchen journey need not be daunting. By focusing on your cooking interests, opting for quality, considering versatility, keeping budget in mind, and ensuring comfort, you will inevitably create a toolkit that encourages you to whip up delicious meals. Embrace the process, and enjoy your cooking adventures as you explore new flavors and techniques!

### Conclusion

Having a well-equipped kitchen is essential for anyone starting their cooking journey, and a home starter kitchen set is the foundation for culinary success. When selecting the essential components, focus on versatile tools like a good set of knives, measuring cups, and mixing bowls. These items streamline your cooking tasks and boost your confidence as you explore new recipes and techniques.

Choosing the right kitchen tools requires a thoughtful approach. Consider your cooking style and the types of meals you want to prepare. For beginners, it’s wise to invest in quality over quantity. Look for items that are multi-functional. For example, a sturdy cutting board can serve as a serving platter, while a pot can double as a mixing bowl.

I'm a working aerospace engineer starting a master's program in aerospace engineering and will be accessing software remotely, such as Solidworks, Abaqus, Ansys, Hypermesh, Python, and MATLAB. I need a laptop with the specs to handle this workload reliably.

Based on specs alone, I’ve narrowed it down to the Dell 16"" 13th Generation Gaming Laptop with an Intel Core i9 processor, priced at $1,599.99 at Best Buy. The specs seem more than sufficient for my needs, especially since I’m not planning to game on it.

However, after reading reviews, I noticed frequent complaints about overheating and issues with the charger. Since my primary use will be at a desk near an outlet, I’m wondering if these issues might still be a problem in my case. Occasionally, I’ll take the laptop to a coffee shop or hotel when traveling for work, but it will mostly stay in a controlled environment.

I’d appreciate any feedback from those familiar with this laptop or similar models. Should I be concerned about the overheating and charger issues even if I’m not pushing it for gaming?

Served my time, I move back to my hometown.
Now this is where it gets a little complicated. 6 months before I moved back to town I started dating someone new which happened to be my best friend’s fiancés ex gf. So fiancés ex gf is who I’m dating. Fiancé is with best friend. lol if you can’t tell it’s a small town. Also atp best friend and I haven’t had any reconnection between us since I left for the military. 

New gf and I have been dating for a year at this time. I go out to a local coffee shop to meet up with a friend for a little bit. While I’m there fiancé walks in and immediately recognizes me. I think nothing of it and continue my conversation with my friend. Fiancé is about to leave with their to go coffees but I could see their hesitation before exiting, they just couldn’t leave without saying something to me. That is when I am met with very angry nonsensical shouting. 

At this point a huge scene is being made in this once quiet coffee shop, so I made the decision to just try to leave. Fiancé wasn’t having that. They got in between me and my car door and kept threatening me. Throughout this entire interaction so far I had remained very calm and tried to deescalate the situation but nothing was helping. 
I kid you not the next thing they did was turn their back towards me and tried to donkey me in the stomach. After trying not to laugh at that sad attempt to hurt me?? I once again asked them to step away from my car door and let me leave to which they tried to swing at me. I put them in a headlock and kept them there tightening my grip, until my friend talked reason back into me and I let go before they passed out. Another chance for them to walk away. No still wasn’t enough for them. They then tried to pull my hair. So that’s when I punched them straight in the eye and nose. Drawing some blood finally made them run away to their car. 

Mind you the whole time this fight is happening in a coffee shop parking lot, my once best friend is screaming at her fiancé “if you love me you will stop” just repeatedly. Also the first time and last time I saw her again since I left for the army. Now it’s pretty obvious fiancé tried to jump me bc they are clearly mad I was fuckin their ex right? 

Well another year or so passes after this whole fight mess. I got lonely and reminiscent and called up my best friend to see how she was doing and I honestly just needed someone to talk to(I was battling ptsd pretty hard at the time). We talked for hours, it felt like old times just her and I against the world again. Having conversations with her feels like getting high, but it started to get late and conversation started to dwindle. That’s when she said “listen I’m all for us being friends again and I really do miss you a lot but you know we can’t be friends again till you apologize to my fiancé”….and she said that those were her terms that her fiancé had nothing to do with those boundaries…Aitah?

Hello friends, I am going to share the review of an extremely popular house called Indian Perfumery aka Alt. I got 12 different perfumes of 20ml each and got a 5 ml sample free. The bottles were pretty strong, and the spray was mist type. No fancy artwork but very neat and clean presentation. Again, want to emphasize that the observations are subjective and my honest take. It may perform or smell differently to others. One interesting thing I encountered during trying them be careful while spraying. If the mist enters your nose, it may make you nose blind for a while. Due to this I had to try couple of them on the second day with caution for an honest observation. Overall, I had a pleasant experience with this house. Please let me know if there is something which I can do to improve.

**1) Black Phantom**

**Clone of:** Black Phantom by Killian

**Impression:** Opens with the boozy smell of rum along with the nutty smell of almonds. The projection is very weak. There is a faint smell of dark chocolate as well. So, the thing is I expected this frag to be a projection beast, but I was disappointed by its performance. This faded away quite fast. First day I thought I have olfactory fatigue, but it was same the next day as well.

**Rating:** 3

**2) Grey Vetiver**

**Clone of:** Grey Vetiver by Tom Ford

**Impression:** A fresh citrusy opening with a hint of spice and mint. This stays for initial 15 mins. Then comes the aromatic smell of vetiver along with woody and musky smell. This was a fresh smell and lasted 4 hrs. It lasts more on garments.

**Rating:** 8

**3) Dior Prive Collection Vetiver**

**Clone of:** Prive Collection Vetiver by Christian Dior

**Impression:** This is plain simple vetiver. I get a very faint herb smell which is hardly detectable. This fails to perform. I might use it to layer it with any other frag.

**Rating:** 3

**4) Cafe Mocha**

**Clone of:** Private Blend

**Impression:** Being a coffee lover myself, I just love this frag. If you step into a cafe coffee day the beautiful smell of fresh roasted coffee beans is what these smells. It is a perfect cafe latte.

**Rating:** 8.5

**5) JPG UltaMale**

**Clone of:** Ultra Male Jean by Paul Gaultier

**Impression:** It has a fruity and sweet opening which consists of pear, citrus, a subtle mint, and a hint of powdery lavender which stays strong for around 30 mins. In the heart there is an aromatic and spicy note. I can smell the warmness of cinnamon. It settles into a soothing vanilla, woody and musky profile. Overall, this projects very well and has a good longevity.

**Rating:** 8.5

**6) BDC**

**Clone of:** Bleu De Chanel by Chanel

**Impression:** Minty lemon opening with added orange feel. Very refreshing and the initial impact is too good. Transports you to a beach with a virgin mojito. The projection is exceptionally good and easily it stays on the skin for 3-4 hrs and garments even longer. You can then start getting an aromatic smell and finally it ends with a woody and musky smell. The best part is the freshness of lemon stays throughout the experience.

**Rating:** 8.5

**7) Neroli Portofino**

**Clone of:** Neroli Portofino by Tom Ford

**Impression:** This is a noticeably light and airy summer scent. Starts with citrus along with a pleasant flowery scent. Reminds me passing through a group of jasmine plants early in the morning. In the end there is a musky scent. Overall, a very refreshing smell. Projection and longevity are decent but not so great as others. You keep getting occasional whiffs in-between until it fades out in 2 hrs.

**Rating:** 7

**8) Invictus Victory Elixir**

**Clone of:** Invictus Victory Elixir by Paco Rabanne

**Impression:** The aromatic cardamom and pepper welcome you. Then there is more aroma which settles to a sweet vanilla and some trace of woody smell. Overall, this is good and projects well for that initial 15-20 mins. The longevity is moderate, and it stays on garment more than the skin.

**Rating:** 8

**9) L’Immensité**

**Clone of:** L’Immensité by Louis Vuitton

**Impression:** This gave me a Vibrato vibe at the start, maybe because of the grapefruit and ginger. I may be wrong so excuse me :). It starts off as a fresh citrus and ginger based mocktail. I say mocktail because of the aquatic feel I get. This profile is awesome. I love the freshness and the subtle hint of ginger along with some aromatic herbs. The dry down to me is powdery and musky. The projection and longevity are decent.

**Rating:** 8.5

**10) Oud Satin Mood**

**Clone of:** Oud Satin Mood by Maison Francis Kurkdjian

**Impression:** This is for the rose lovers out there. Starts off with a sweet smelling rose powder which stays for a longtime. The projection is exceptionally good. It finally settles into a nice vanilla and woody smell. The longevity is also fairly good. I am not a fan of this profile but if anyone likes this profile it is incredibly good.

**Rating:** 8

**11) Musk Therapy**

**Clone of:** Musk Therapy by Initio

**Impression:** It is a mix of citrusy, mint, white floral like jasmine type of frag with added musk. This is a little sweet and warm fragrance according to me. Overall, I can also smell a certain tablet kind of smell, like a calcium tablet. It had decent projection and good longevity. I sprayed a few drops before my workout, and it held its potency while I was sweating like a pig.

**Rating:** 8

**12) Electric Cherry**

**Clone of:** Electric Cherry by Tom Ford

**Impression:** Opens with a sweet fruity candy kind of smell with a hint of ginger and spice. The initial projection is incredibly good. In the heart there is a pleasant smell of jasmine flower, and it ends with a powdery musky smell. The sweetness stays throughout the journey. Overall, it is a very uplifting perfume which will awaken your spirits. This is a female oriented frag imo, especially teens.

**Rating:** 8.5

**13) Baccarat Rouge 540**

**Clone of:** Baccarat Rouge 540 by Maison Francis Kurkdjian

**Impression:** As soon as I spray, I get the smell of jasmine flower with the smell of saffron. They continue to be the major contributors. Then there is a mix of earthy, woody, musky smell. Just like the smell you get when you are around a damp tree. Somehow, I did not enjoy this profile. Maybe the og will be a little different, but not my type. Projection and longevity are moderate. Kind of an intimate scent to me.

**Rating:** 7.5

She’s quite innocent and has historically been a little naive reading guys intentions. Just as she met me she had this guy friend who they spent a lot of time with each other for months, she thought it was just platonic until he confessed his love for her and tried to kiss her, she was shocked and ultimatum realised she’d been unintentionally leading him on. This was as she started dating me and we agreed for everyone’s sake that she’d cut out contact with him. 9 months later we broke up for a 3 month period and she made contact with him, during this time they spent a lot of time together, got closer, he started giving her signals, she was commenting love hearts on his posts, their friends were assuming something was happening to the point one of his friends asked her. She seriously considered dating him during this time but ultimately decided he wasn’t her type. We then got back together which when the guy found out things got a little weird with her as he was avoiding her, they ultimately sorted it out. To her credit she said he was back in the scene as friends and I agreed that I was uncomfortable but I’d make an effort for her because I knew how much he meant to her as a friend. As time has gone on (3months) I found out that she did seriously consider dating him which she didn’t tell me at the start and everytime they go for lunch together or for coffee/ice cream one on one together it drives me insane and makes me feel extremely uncomfortable. On the flip side, I’ve unfollowed girls who me being friends with 4 years ago has triggered her and I’ve done everything to make her feel comfortable. She has told me more or less that she wouldn’t cut him off unless he made a move on her again etc but even though I trust her, I know he’s waiting and I know given the opportunity he’d pounce on it.

1i4u4x3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i4u4x3/my_dad_had_a_seizure_i_think_in_a_japan_airport/,my dad had a seizure (i think) in a japan airport. how do i stop obsessively worrying? ,"17f i'm dealing with lots of stress after watching this happen. my dad is 67. me and my family traveled to vietnam for a few weeks to see family on my moms side. me and my dad both went home a week early because i had school and he had work. we arrived in japan for a connecting flight. we checked a screen which told us our next flight was at a specific gate. we went and ate at a sushi place, my dad didn't want anything to eat but he had two beers. when we arrived back at the gate about 20-30 minutes before boarding, i decided to check with a flight attendant if it was the right flight. although i'm 100% sure we went to the gate read on the screen, they told us we were at the wrong gate. they told us the right gate was far and to run so we weren't late. we sped walk at first but my dad started running, he was running for so long i couldn't even keep up with him. when he got there, i was around 70 feet behind him, but i could still see him and watched him enter the coffee place nearby. i took my eyes off him for a second and lost track of him, i thought he went through the coffee place to the gate so i went there and looked around for him. after a minute i spotted him sitting at a table in the coffee place. i walked up to him and some airport staff were surrounding him. he was slumped over, eyes half open, and drooling on himself. he had sudden jolts every so often. he was completely unresponsive. i was panicking, the staff was trying to tap him awake. they confirmed i was his daughter and i was trying my best to help. like asking to get a cold towel, and wiping his face. they asked me questions about what happened. two australians came over, a male paramedic and a female who knew first aid. they didn't know each other but they just met. the paramedic laid my dad on the ground and the woman just tried to keep me calm. after laying my dad down my dad began to gain consciousness but he was acting very off. his movements were exaggerated, like he was VERY drunk. he was looking around like a baby, his eyes and mouth were wide open and he was moving his tongue weirdly. he began to talk to the paramedic and my dad couldn't control his volume. he was slurring his words and rambling, he kept saying he was fine. my mom over the phone revealed to the paramedic that he was having issues with his heart valves and was supposed to get heart surgery. his doctors thought it was crazy that he was going to asia for 3 weeks, but agreed to let him go as long as he didn't over-exert himself. my dad slowly began to get better, and when the japanese paramedics arrived he was back to his normal self. this whole thing lasted for around 10-15 minutes, or atleast it felt like it did. my dad ended up getting released from the hospital early, his brain and heart scans were fine and they gave him the okay to fly. they didn't tell him any info on what happened probably because of the language barrier. we stayed at the airport hotel and got on our rebooked flight the next day. he had wheel chair accommodations and got special treatment. everything went smoothly after that and now we're back home in america.

i'm very worried for my dad. me and my family had to beg him to get wheelchair accommodations. he was very embarrassed over the whole thing. he keeps insisting it was fine but it was very scary especially since i was there with him alone. i'm very very grateful to everyone who helped us, a kind staff member even gave me her instagram to communicate on. i'm just having massive anxiety over leaving my dad alone. i'm scared he will have another seizure when i'm not there. i feel guilty for not being able to keep up with him when he was running, or why i didn't check the coffee shop he went into first. i also feel a bit angry with some of the flight staff, like whoever put the incorrect gate on the screen and didn't update it, and the lady who told us to run when we weren't actually really late. we were in group 5, and when we got there the flight wasn't even boarding. we would've had time if we just walked. it's just been a painful reminder that my dad is getting old. it was really disturbing to see him this way, and sometimes i feel like it was my fault. when i was eating at the restaurant, after i was done eating we just sat there and talked instead of heading back. and i know my dad is forgetful, i feel like i should've continued our conversation while walking. the rest of my family doesn't arrive for another week and its giving me lots of anxiety that i'm the only one here to keep an eye on him. it'd feel better if my mom was here, they sleep together and wake up at the same time every morning. how do i stop worrying about this event? i don't think he will have another seizure as long as he doesn't tire himself out like that again, he tells me he's fine and not to worry, but i'm so scared and i feel responsible for him.

Wednesday’s Scoop (In Case You Missed It)

Anyone who has lived in Swansea for a while will tell you that we’re not an area blessed with much snowfall - not in the past couple of decades, at least.

But there was a period where, snow or no snow, interest in skiing was at its peak - and one Swansea businessman decided to capitalise by building a dry ski slope - the remains of which can still be seen today.

Read the full and fascinating story of Swansea’s Dry Ski Slope: [https://www.swanseascoop.com/p/swansea--dry-ski-slope-centre](https://www.swanseascoop.com/p/swansea--dry-ski-slope-centre)

Also, on Friday afternoon, I accidentally sent a “Wednesday” email (that I meant to schedule for the future!) about the amazing story of Lizzie, the famous Swansea Museum elephant who dodged WW2 bombs! Sorry about that, but I hope you enjoyed it nonetheless. 😊🐘

","Woodworking can be a fulfilling and enjoyable hobby. For many, the appeal lies in transforming raw pieces of wood into beautiful, functional, and practical items. Whether you’re looking to create a stylish bookshelf or a simple cutting board, simple woodworking plans provide the blueprint for success. In this guide, we’ll dive into the basics of woodworking, explore essential tools and materials, and offer step-by-step instructions for creating simple yet impressive projects.

# 1. Introduction

Woodworking offers a satisfying blend of creativity, craftsmanship, and practicality. Simple woodworking plans are a perfect way for beginners to ease into this craft. These plans break down complex tasks into manageable steps, ensuring that even those new to woodworking can succeed.

**Why Simple Woodworking Plans Matter:**  
For beginners, having a clear and easy-to-follow guide can make the difference between frustration and success.

They include everything from the tools you’ll need to detailed diagrams, making it easy to bring your vision to life.

* **Clamps**: Hold pieces of wood together while assembling.

# Types of Wood Used in Simple Projects

* **Pine**: A softwood that is inexpensive and easy to work with. Ideal for beginner projects.
* **Oak**: A durable hardwood with a beautiful grain, perfect for furniture projects.

# 3. Key Elements of Simple Woodworking Plans

What makes a woodworking plan effective for beginners? Simplicity, clarity, and comprehensive detail are key. Here’s a breakdown of what you should look for in an ideal plan.

# Clear Instructions and Diagrams

A well-designed woodworking plan will include straightforward, step-by-step instructions along with diagrams. The diagrams should clearly show the dimensions and how each piece fits together.

# Material and Tool Lists

Each plan should provide a list of all the materials (wood, screws, nails, etc.) and tools required for the project. This ensures you have everything you need before starting.

# Step-by-Step Process Breakdown

The heart of a good plan is the step-by-step breakdown. Each step should be simple, easy to follow, and clearly show what needs to be done next.

# Safety Guidelines for Beginners

Every woodworking plan should emphasize safety. Proper safety gear, like goggles and hearing protection, should be worn, and any potential hazards should be highlighted in the instructions.

# 4. Types of Simple Woodworking Projects

Woodworking can encompass a wide variety of projects. For beginners, starting with simple projects helps build confidence and skills.

# Small Furniture Items

* **Bookshelves**: A practical and relatively simple first project. Materials like pine are easy to work with, and the design can be as simple or elaborate as desired.
* **Side Tables**: A small table is a great entry-level project that provides a useful end product.
* **Chairs**: While a bit more complex, a simple chair can be a great way to learn about joints and stability.

# Home Décor

* **Picture Frames**: Create custom frames for family photos or artwork. This project teaches you basic cutting and assembly skills.
* **Planters**: Simple wooden planters can add a personal touch to your home décor.

# Practical Items

* **Storage Boxes**: These can be simple or more decorative, and they're a great way to practice measurements and cutting.
* **Cutting Boards**: A fun project that requires precision cutting and finishing.

# Outdoor Projects

* **Birdhouses**: Ideal for beginners, these small projects can teach basic cutting and assembly.
* **Garden Benches**: These projects offer slightly more complexity, as they require sturdy joinery for stability.

# 5. Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Simple Woodworking Plans

Creating a woodworking plan from scratch involves several steps, from the initial concept to the finished product. Let’s break down the process.

# Conceptualizing the Project

Start by deciding what you want to create. Think about what will be practical for your space, what fits your skill level, and what tools you have access to. You can draw inspiration from books, websites, or your own imagination.

# Drafting Initial Designs

Once you’ve decided on a project, create a rough sketch. It doesn’t need to be perfect, but the more detailed you are, the easier it will be to follow the plan later. Include measurements, as this will guide your cuts.

# Choosing the Right Materials

Select your materials based on the project. Softwoods like pine are great for beginner projects, but if you’re looking for something with more durability, hardwoods like oak or maple may be better. Also, take note of the thickness and width of the wood for each piece in your design.

# Making Detailed Instructions

Now, take your design and break it down into simple, clear instructions. Include all necessary tools and materials and be sure to include safety tips. Write each step carefully, ensuring that beginners can follow along without confusion.

# Testing and Refining the Plan

Before sharing or using the plan, it’s essential to test it out. Build the project yourself or ask someone else to build it based on the plan. Make adjustments as needed based on real-world execution.

# 6. Choosing the Right Materials

When working on woodworking projects, the materials you choose can have a significant impact on both the look and durability of your final product.

# Softwoods vs. Hardwoods

* **Softwoods** like pine are cheaper and easier to work with but may not be as durable or have as fine a finish as hardwoods.
* **Hardwoods** like oak and maple are more durable and create a more polished look but are typically more expensive and harder to cut.

# Budget-Friendly Wood Options

If you're on a budget, consider materials like pine or poplar. These woods are inexpensive, easy to find, and versatile for a range of projects.

# Eco-Friendly Wood Choices

Recycled wood, bamboo, or sustainably harvested woods are all great eco-friendly choices for woodworking projects.

# Types of Fasteners and Adhesives

* **Nails and Screws**: Basic fasteners for securing wood pieces together.
* **Wood Glue**: Often used in combination with nails or screws for a stronger bond.

# 7. Detailed Woodworking Projects for Beginners

Here are a few simple yet rewarding projects to help you get started.

# Simple Bookshelf: Materials, Tools, and Instructions

* **Materials**: Pine boards, screws, wood glue.
* **Tools**: Saw, drill, measuring tape, square.
* **Instructions**: Measure and cut four boards to the desired size, drill holes for screws, and assemble the pieces using screws and wood glue.

# Coffee Table: Step-by-Step Plan

* **Materials**: Oak, screws, wood finish.
* **Tools**: Drill, saw, screwdriver, sander.
* **Instructions**: Measure and cut the table top, legs, and support beams. Assemble the frame first, then attach the table top and finish.

# 8. Understanding Measurements and Cuts

Accurate measurements are crucial in woodworking. Using a tape measure, calipers, and square can help ensure that your pieces fit together perfectly.

# 9. Basic Woodworking Techniques

Mastering basic techniques like drilling, sanding, and assembling joints will elevate your woodworking skills. Practice these skills before moving on to more complicated projects.

# 11. Tips for Improving Your Woodworking Skills

Start small, learn from your mistakes, and consider taking classes or watching online tutorials to continue improving.

# 12. Troubleshooting Common Woodworking Issues

Mistakes happen! Whether it’s a crooked cut or a rough edge, there are ways to fix most woodworking problems.

# 13. Tools You’ll Need for Simple Woodworking Plans

From hand tools to power tools, understanding the tools necessary for your project will make the process smoother.

1i4u3fh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4u3fh,My extremely UNaethetic and functional coffee station.,"Hello everyone. Wanted to show my coffee station ever since I got into the rabbit hole of specialty coffee, but unfortunately I can’t manage the counter space. Finally I gave up and decided to show my equipment nevertheless. Maybe when I move out of my hostel in a few months I’ll be able to showcase my stuff better.
Details of equipment:
1. French press: A cheap French press I bought a few years ago off amazon. Nowadays I only use it sparingly to foam milk when I try milk based drinks (<once a month)
2. Aeropress Go: first coffee brewing equipment bought a few months back after deciding to get back into coffee. Very reliable, quick and portable (I had a cheap coffee machine for a few months which I donated).
3. Picopresso: bought just after the Aeropress, I thought I liked espresso.This makes great espresso once dialled in, but I have discovered that I enjoy pour overs the best.
4. Bialetti moka pot: reliable coffee, good for milk based stuff, used sparingly.
5. V60 Switch 02: My workhorse. This makes great coffee. This is my daily driver and the versatility I can achieve with this is unprecedented. I generally use the 4:6 method and keep adjusting the initial 40% for the bean.
6. Deep 27: My newest brewer. The first cup I made was very under-extracted, but the second cup was very delicious (made by the pulse recipe by aramse). I think I will use it the most for afternoon and evening brews when I just need a small cup of coffee.
7. Wacaco Exagrind: My grinder, bought with the picopresso. Works great for me, for both espresso and pour over grinds.
8. Hario air kettle: I don’t have a gooseneck kettle, and good ones are too expensive for me right now. This is a very good alternative that I found, which has a very consistent stream for both low and high flow.
Rounded off with a standard electric kettle (not in photo) and a good enough weighing scale.
Currently I am drinking 4 coffees: 3 are from Naivo (Ratnagiri 72H Anaerobic Naturals, Kudiraipanjan 96H Sugarcane Maceration, and Salawara 75H Carbonic Naturals) with a long story of my order getting mixed up and me receiving 2 extra coffee beans. No complains with Naivo, they gave me my order and let me keep the 2 other bags for free. The 4th is the most interesting: It’s a Geisha from Huila, Colombia anaerobic washed process. It has very distinct flavour from all the other coffees I have tasted till now. Very sweet undertone, medium body with mild acidity. I use the Airscape coffee containers if I cross 3 weeks past the roasting date.
3rd photo is of the coffee bed of Salawara estate beans I brewed today. I used the osmotic flow method for the first time in stead of my usual 4:6 method. It gave a cup with bright acidity, medium body body, light sweetness and a prolonged aftertaste.

I'm a 37-year-old Finn who lived in England for a little over eight years before returning to Finland a couple of years ago. I'm married with a child so I'm not looking for anything else than kindred spirits and blossoming friendships.

I've been penpalling since I was 11-12 years old and in spite of some breaks that I've taken over the years, I've never really lost my love for the written word. I've always been shy and very much an introvert (maybe highly sensitive as well even if never officially diagnosed?) which is why getting to know new people ""in real life"" can be challenging for me. I guess that's why writing has always been my preferred medium of communication and in fairness, I do express myself better in writing 💜 That's why I'm not searching for people who send one A6 sheet and goodies every two weeks. Quite the opposite. Although, I don't solely stare at the number of pages written, I do expect to receive letters that require more than five minutes of my time to read. Furthermore, I cannot guarantee replies in a certain time frame. I most certainly don't (can't) write back ""straight away"".

Reading is another dear hobby of mine: I mainly read chick lit and crime novels but I'm happy to try other genres as well should the plot be compelling enough. If I could, I'd spend all my money on stationery and new books: if only I could buy a house big enough for a 'Beauty and the Beast' style library... Sigh.

In addition, I like, for example, travelling and visiting new places (Japan 💜 I'm currently studying Japanese by myself), rock and heavy metal music, owls, history, being by the sea, drinking too much coffee (I am Finnish after all), postcards with quotes on them, Downton Abbey, journalling, Moomins, Christmas and everything that goes with it... Just to name but a few things ☺️ 

Hopefully someone, a kindred spirit perhaps, would find me and my introduction interesting enough to want to become (pen) friends ☺️",6,1737275648.0,penpals,0,1.0,False
1i4u2tq,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1i4u2tq/quit_again_and_my_fav_benefits_are_back/,Quit again and my fav benefits are back ,"I had a couple successful stints off caffeine in 2024, but I think each only lasted a month or so. I picked it up again in July during a family visit and thought, no problem, I’ll just drop it again. Wrong! Every time I start again - even one cup of coffee or Yerba mate - it is so, so hard to quit. I have one cup followed by euphoria and hyper productivity, get hooked, and by the end of the week I’m back to 450mg a day and an anxious, tense wreck. To quit, I feel like I need a long chunk of
time with no work to be exhausted and miserable until the worst of the withdrawal passes.

I decided to quit again for new years, and then got the flu a couple days before new years, so
I used that opportunity to stop caffeine and just lay in bed for the first couple days. So I’m up to a 20 day streak now.

If there were some pill that gave all the benefits that quitting caffeine does, it would be regarded as a miracle drug. The first week was definitely hard. I weirdly don’t get headaches from lack of caffeine, but the exhaustion was bone deep.

3 weeks in, my sleep is amazing. It’s hard to overstate how much of a difference it is. I feel rested and like I slept instead of like I, well, didn’t sleep. It’s easier for me to get out of bed in the morning. I have adhd, and always thought coffee helped it, but it made it so much worse. I am able to narrow in on tasks and focus so much more readily now. My energy and attention stays much more constant through the day.

And for my favorite benefit and the main reason I quit - my muscle tension, esp in my neck and shoulders, has gone from actively bothering me every day to almost completely gone. I still have knots and issues, don’t get me wrong, but they don’t feel inflamed and like they’re screaming at me anymore. I was getting a massage about once every 3 weeks just to manage pain levels. Now, I can feel where my root issues actually are vs all my muscles feeling like they’re on fire. And I’m really looking forward to saving time and money that was going to massage. I think a huge part of this is likely that I’m clenching my jaw less.

Also, I’m much more hydrated - I often have dark purple circles under my eyes, and they’re lightening considerably with caffeine removed.

I’m starting to lose weight. Towards the end before I quit I had given up coffee but was drinking Yerba mate with sugar, and it was adding up. 

Finally, I feel more even, less anxious, and less frustrated or angry.

Seriously, if a pill promised to make me wake up rested, eliminate my muscle tension, lesson my under eye circles, lose weight, and regulate mood swings, I don’t know how much I’d pay for it but it would be a lot. And we can have that just by avoiding this drug.

Cons: esp with ADHD, I’m so bored sometimes and desperately want the euphoria and mood bump I know it would give  me.  My husband still keeps Yerba around and I want it so much. But then I remember the awful sleep, muscle pain and how it takes me 6 months to quit, and I find the strength to continue.

Btw, I used hot chocolate as a bridge off caffeine, and then stopped that. It was helpful as a bridge.",9,1737275577.0,decaf,0,0.92,False
1i4u1r4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/comments/1i4u1r4/devupdate_18_first_year_of_walkscape/,DevUpdate #18: First Year Of WalkScape!,"# First Year Of WalkScape!

Welcome to the special development update! We’ve reached a significant milestone - WalkScape is now **one year old!**

To celebrate this, I’ll write here all the significant things that have happened so far, and also share some testimonials and interesting statistics. Let’s dive in!

# The Timeline

* 19.01.2024 — WalkScape Closed Beta release.

We had originally hoped to release the Closed Beta earlier, and after a lengthy crunch, I managed to get everything ready for the release during the 18th. However, Apple's review process took a surprisingly long period of time. After multiple hours of waiting, the first version of Closed Beta (0.1.0+72) was released around 6 AM Finnish time. It was a long night! The first wave of WalkScape had 750 players.

* 20.01.2024 — Leaderboards added to WalkScape Portal.
* 20.01.2024 — I flew to London to show the game at Pocket Gamer Connects London.

Gotta say that I was very tired during this trip, having just spent the last few weeks staying up all night finishing all that was needed for initial Closed Beta release, and then flying to London straight afterwards.

* 07.02.2024 — Improvements to the Patreon & Buy Me a Coffee integrations.
* 28.02.2024 — Wave Two for WalkScape began.

With Wave Two, our player count increased from 750 to almost 5,000. We also released a pretty large content update to the game that went live with the Wave. This Wave focused on activities for the transformation skills, as well as plenty of beloved unique items spread throughout Jarvonia and GDTE.

* 13.03.2024 — Post-Wave Two update released with pedometer fixes.

During the first few months, even after this update, a lot of my time was spent on trying to perfect the pedometer in WalkScape. For the most part, we had difficulties on fixing weird pedometer behavior for Android devices. Sadly most of this work was also wasted, as Google released a fix to it with the introduction of Recording API.

* 15.03.2024 — Another pedometer fix update released.
* 18.04.2024 — Myzozoz joins WalkScape development team.

After spending a couple weeks on review process, we hired a new developer to WalkScape - myzozoz! Our increased Patreon & BMaC support finally allowed us to hire another pair of hands to work on the game. Before this, I was the only developer working on the game, and floursifter worked on community management & content design, and maxchill worked on art.

Around this time, another fix to pedometer issues was released as well.

* 16.05.2024 — Android pedometer finally fully functional.

A couple of weeks before this, Google had released Recording API. I had worked around 2 months at this point trying to perfect the Android pedometer on my own, and suddenly Google released an API that fixed it overnight.

Also, the website was reworked from scratch, and Wave 2.5 date was released.

* 01.06.2024 — Wave 2.5 began.
* 27.06.2024 — A new update with a bunch of new features was released.

After a couple of months spent on the pedometer, we were finally back to adding new features to the game. We released Friends system, WalkPedia, major content rebalance, Shop rework and Adventurers Guild with a few new locations and a bunch of new content to the game.

* 11.07.2024 — Achievements added to WalkScape.

Another update released, adding the achievements system to the game. The team also went for Summer vacation around this time, and it was my first vacation I had had in years, so I was very happy!

* 20.08.2024 — Syrenthia update released, and Wave 3 begins.

Our most massive update was released, adding Consumables and a ton of new content, including a new realm to the game. At this point, we started to feel that our internal development tools and engine were starting to get stretched to their maximum, and they urgently needed improvements. The update was actually pushed out from an airplane while me and myzozoz were flying to Gamescom.

* 19.09.2024 — Not a Cult turned one year old.

The company I founded for WalkScape had completed its first year! It was a lot of learning for me how to run a business, and I had at this point worked on WalkScape full-time for around 8 months.

* 03.10.2024 — Pocket Gamer Connects Helsinki, and winning the Best Indie Game award.

We had been at four conventions at this point — PGC Helsinki 2023, W Love Games 2023, PGC London 2024, Gamescom, and now PGC Helsinki 2024. We won the best indie game audience award from PGC Helsinki, which was a huge deal for me personally.

* 17.10.2024 — Hotfixing WalkScape, patching Syrenthia issues.

We released a series of minor patches to WalkScape and added translations to the game. Many of the issues here were mostly content-related, which were a result of our outdated internal development tools. When I started this project, I thought it would be enough that I create tooling that only scales for one person who is using them — me. With the project scaling up massively, both with the team size increasing and the game getting more complex, the engine and tooling started to show that they needed more work.

* 01.11.2024 — Work on reworking the game engine started.

With most of Syrenthia-related issues now fixed, I started to work on reworking the game engine. This process is now almost finished, with the reworked engine hopefully released very soon. Floursifter and maxchill started to work on our next content update, while myzozoz worked on Party system.

# My thoughts

I'm super happy with the progress we've had in our year one. There are also a ton of things I didn't include here — we made a license agreement with Jagex, we started Wave 3.5, I overhauled the UI of the game, we released a merch store, we had an intern Sorgo joining our team for a few months, and a lot more. With a tiny team, and with just community funding, we've got a lot of things done in our first year of operation.

There were also a lot of lessons learned during the year. A lot of my time was also spent on company bureaucracy stuff, fixing the pedometer, and now the last 3 months have been spent on reworking the game engine. This engine work has been a massive time sink, but I'm very pleased that it was done. Now the game's code is finally properly organized, it uses multi-threading, we have new server technology to support multiple times the players we could before. Most of all, the technical debt has now been paid that was mainly caused by rapidly expanding things.

Also, the first year was unsurprisingly a year of many firsts. I've never run a company before, I've never sat at the other end of a job interview table (which was a local pub actually, we didn't have an office at that time), I've never needed to write privacy policies, pay salaries, do accounting, represent a company at game conventions, hold board meetings, and so forth. Working as a game startup requires you to really wear dozens of different hats. And I'm glad we've made it through without any major issues.

After the engine work is done, we're looking forward to getting back to releasing new features more rapidly. We also need to rework our internal development tools, as one of the biggest pain points for us during and after Syrenthia was how messy creating content for the game got when its complexity increased.

# My wishes for 2025

For 2025, I'm definitely most excited about getting the game to Open Beta. That's our biggest priority.

Our largest bottleneck for getting things done more rapidly is that we still only have two developers. One of my greatest wishes would be hiring a third developer for the game, but our finances at the moment don't really allow it. Not a Cult had revenue of 62k euros during the first year, with 2k of profit. So there's little to no extra left after paying all of the costs that go towards the development.

I'm hoping that our revenue would increase so that hiring one more developer would become possible! The money we get from Patreon & BMaC goes directly into making the game better and speeding things up, and every bit of support helps. And thank you all who have been supporting us and helping us over the first year. It would've never been possible for me to quit my previous job, put my university studies on indefinite pause, and hire another full-time developer to the project without the support.

# Numbers & testimonials

Let's dive into some numbers and some player testimonials we've had during the first year! We've asked these people who are included in the testimonials for permission to use their testimonials.

* Wave 1: 752 Closed Beta players, and 4,948 registered accounts.
* Wave 2: 4,718 Closed Beta players, and 10,447 registered accounts.
* Wave 2.5: 12,085 Closed Beta players, and 21,864 registered accounts.
* Wave 3: 19,811 Closed Beta players, and 30,115 registered accounts.
* Wave 3.5: 24,683 Closed Beta players, and 47,290 registered accounts.

During the first year, our player count increased by 3,282% and the number of registered players by 955%. For those who wonder why we have had the Wave system even for our supporters: with almost 50k registered people and just one person (me) reading and answering the customer support emails, it's been one of the reasons we've managed to make so much progress between the waves. During the waves, most of our time goes to customer support and marketing.

Our players together have now walked over 8.1 billion steps. And I must say, that one of the best things of our first year has been all of the feedback, testimonials, and community interactions we've had. It always makes my day to hear that the game has helped someone greatly — that's something much greater to me than just making a game. And I'm very thankful for everyone who has been cheering for us, translating the game, and providing invaluable feedback or helping in other ways throughout the year. So **thank you, WalkScapers!**

Here are some testimonials we’ve had:

# Let’s make 2025 even better year for WalkScape

That's all for this development update! 2024 was a great year, and we learned a lot about how to make the game even better. Our goal is to use all we have learned and make 2025 the best year for walking and playing the game. It was also a huge change for me personally, going from an IT consultant and university student to full-time entrepreneur. We'll keep working as hard as we can to deliver the best possible fitness game there is. I'm hoping our community keeps being awesome and providing us with their feedback to guide us on this task. And most of all, we'll keep walking.

Like typical besties, we did almost everything together. But when we started college, we began drifting apart a bit due to our busy lives and new social circles. We still kept in touch, just not as much as before.

One day, she texted me about a New Year’s party she was hosting and invited me over. She told me to arrive a bit later, around 10:30 or 11 PM. I thought that was fine and asked if we should have dinner beforehand or at her place. She told me she would eat before the party and suggested I do the same. She also mentioned that some of her friends would be there, and I was genuinely looking forward to meeting them.

When I arrived, I met her friends and did the usual introductions. Later, while helping one of her close friends with dessert, her friend casually mentioned how delicious the dinner had been earlier. Surprised, I asked when they had arrived, and she told me they’d been there for hours, cooking and enjoying the meal together.

I was hurt but kept a straight face, trying to enjoy the night and not bring it up to my best friend.

A few days later, I texted her, asking if we could talk over coffee. I felt like she had lied to me by not mentioning the dinner before I arrived, and I needed to understand why. She admitted that she and her friends had planned the dinner together and that she hadn’t intended for me to join, assuming I had other plans. She apologized, but I couldn’t shake the feeling of being excluded and I didn’t express how deeply it affected me. We hugged and went our separate ways.

Since then, I’ve ignored her messages and calls. Eventually, I decided to cut her off completely. I deleted her number and even changed mine when I moved to a different city for a new job.

So, am I the asshole for not forgiving her over this?

I know some might think this isn’t a big enough issue to hold such a grudge over, but she was my best friend. It’s not just that she didn’t include me in their dinner, it’s the fact that she wasn’t honest about it. She let me think we’d be eating separately and then meeting for the party, but in reality, she had no intention of including me in that part of the night. I understand people make new friends, but she could’ve at least been upfront with me.",2,1737275185.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False

I(19m) am technically in a slight dilemma with his girl(18F) and we're friends for now. For context, shes been really friendly with me and we've have talked platonically and went for coffee a few times now. The both of us have sent reels to each other regularly. But something you should note is that she's interested in me before i introduced her to my bro because i wasn't ready for a relationship at that time. But now that im more ready, what do i do?

Edit: Now im not jumping to conclusions but the thing im suspecting that they won't last long is because my friend will be moving to study abroad somewhere far. Because from experience my friend too isn't particularly low in terms of how many exes hes had.",1,1737275165.0,askteenboys,5,0.67,False
1i4tza9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i4tza9,Passed My PMP Exam Yesterday.,"I discovered this community a few months ago.
I have been studying for the PMP on and off since March 2024, but I never thought I was ready until I came across this page.

I attended a PMP course to fulfill the 35-hour requirement, didn't know about Udemy Option.

I decide to give it a shot serious in December, took two. weeks off to fully revise and I did both the two mock exams as well as the Mini Exams.

In my country, finding PMI centers is not easy, so I decided to take the exam from home. Naturally, I was scared because I had read so many stories about challenges with taking the exam at home. However, my experience went smoothly, and I finished with 55 minutes remaining on the clock.

If you are doubting yourself like I was, see the photos of my Study Hall (SH) before I decided to take the exam.

My exam included about 8 drag-and-drop questions and 2 questions on SPI and CPI.

As is customary here, the materials I used were:

1. Study Hall (a must!)


2. 3rd Rock Notes (exam cheat sheet)


3. David McLachlan’s YouTube videos


4. Muhammad Rahman’s 23 exam mindsets



Best of luck In your PMP Journey.

It was a rather slow realisation as I awoke to a new day, the crushing truth that none of this had been a dream slowly dawning on me as I awoke to the sound of waves lashing against the upper floor windows. It was then that my sleepy state rapidly subsided, and I recalled every awful detail of the previous night. With the effects of last night’s alcohol consumption largely wearing off by this stage, little things began to come back to me. The first notable image which ran through my mind with renewed clarity, was the arrival of this mysterious ferry at Balmain East, near on midnight. It was clear to me now there were definitely not supposed to be any ferries running back this way at that time. And furthermore, something about the vessel didn’t look right. The ferries of Sydney Harbour have a distinct green and yellow look to them. I suppose I passed it off at the time, as it was dark and foggy, and I was more interested in getting home than anything, but I did recall being slightly taken aback at the time by the unique dark grey colouring of this one. I sat up, rubbing my eyes, intending to head outside and confirm my hazy memory, when I heard a crackle from above me…

*“Greetings passengers. The café service is now open. Please proceed to the counter in an orderly fashion, and you will be served momentarily.”*

Huh… I thought. I might actually get to speak to someone, maybe find out what the hell is going on. I glanced around, and yes, there was indeed a man behind the counter at the café. He was a rather tall individual, bald, and he wore a grey suit. Strange attire for a café worker on a commuter ferry, I thought, but then again… look where we are… I gathered myself before standing up and making my way over to the café. There were a couple of passengers ahead of me, so I stood back and waited my turn. Their behaviour seemed ever so slightly off to me, and I was reminded of the strange man last night. They were acting very similar to him, standing there nervously, shifting their weight from side to side, heads down staring at their feet. The first man made his way up to the counter, and quietly mumbled something to the attendant, before stepping back and waiting for his order. The tall man behind the counter smiled softly, before turning around and reaching into the freezer compartment, pulling out a Mrs Macs sausage roll and throwing it into the microwave. He then returned to the counter as the second customer stepped up, placing an order for a coffee and a slice of carrot cake. Café guy gave me a weird vibe. He was simultaneously the kindest man I had ever laid eyes on, smiling the sweetest of smiles as he served the customers their orders, and yet there was something ominous about his demeanour, as though secrets were hiding behind those kind eyes. Secrets I wanted in on. I snapped myself back into the present moment, as I noticed he was staring at me, and I stepped up to the counter. His expression changed as he got a good look at me, the kind smile replaced with a look of concern, and a hint of amusement.

“Hmm”, he mused. “Interesting…”

I raised an eyebrow at this, curious to know what he found so interesting about me.

“Um… excuse me, but, what’s interesting?” I asked him, not bothering to beat around the bush. He stared back at me for a moment, before shaking his head.

“Oh… sorry sir, never mind me, it’s a bit too early in the morning I suppose. What can I get you today?”

I glanced around behind me, and seeing no more customers waiting in line, I decided now was a good time to press for answers. I leaned in, lowering my voice to an almost whisper.

“Can you tell me what’s going on? I got on this ferry late last night and before I knew what was going on we were heading out to sea. Is this normal? Is there a new route I don’t know about? And what’s with the Captain? He didn’t answer when I knocked on the door and called out…”

Café guy breathed in slowly before letting out a sigh, and I stepped back, sensing a little annoyance on his part. I quickly relaxed though, as that kind smile returned.

“Sir… this is the same route this service has always taken. This is the same route it will always take. There’s no need to worry, you’ll be home soon. Now, what can I get you?”

I just stared at him, a mix of curiosity and concern present on my face. But I decided to place a molecule of faith in his words, he seemed confident that I’d be on my way back home soon enough. Don’t get me wrong, even in that moment, I was still acutely aware that something was very wrong with this ferry, but it’s amazing how far the rational side of the brain can stretch when it wants to. 

With a sigh, I spoke up. “Just a coffee thanks mate. Latte. Two shots.”

Café guy nodded, “Coming right up sir.”

I waited patiently as he prepared my coffee, humming Kumbaya to himself as he did so. He was an odd fellow, with a personality that didn’t seem to match his face. With a hiss of the coffee machine, steam pouring out of the vents, my coffee was ready, and he handed it to me with that same warm smile, never wavering. I nodded to him before turning and walking back toward the rear doors, eager to get some caffeine into my system.

Sliding open the rear doors, I stepped out onto the upper deck, walking over to the railings and resting against them as I stared out over the infinite blue expanse before me. Yep, definitely wasn’t a dream, there was no sign of land in any direction. I noticed how strangely quiet it was, and I then realised the ferry’s engine wasn’t running. We were just kind of bobbing up and down there in the water. The waves, a little calmer now, lapping up against the side of the boat. I gripped the railing a little tighter, as I noted the absence of Seagull calls, realising we must be very, very far out to sea. I felt a chill come over me as I imagined the expansive black hole beneath the ferry, the only protection from being swallowed up by it being this rickety bucket of bolts I was standing on. My grip on the railing tightened a little further as the ship subtly rocked from side to side. I sipped my coffee, trying my best to distract myself from those thoughts, and I pondered what lay ahead for me. My mind was still plagued by the possibilities as to what could be going on, still not satisfied that a hijacking was out of the question. Would we soon be approached by pirate vessels? Would we simply explode at any moment, leaving any survivors to the fate of the pacific ocean? No, that didn’t make sense, there weren’t enough of us on board to make any kind of terroristic political statement worthwhile. There was something more to this. I didn’t know what, but with every passing second the hope of actually getting home was becoming more and more of a distant pipe dream.

***Bwooooooom! Bwooooooom!***

Two loud blasts from the Ferry’s blower, and the engine roared to life, an announcement over the P.A following a moment later.

*“Attention passengers, this service will be departing momentarily. The café is now closed. Please take your seats.”*

I stepped back inside, just in time to see café guy closing up shop and heading downstairs. He gave me a little wave as he left, and I hesitantly gave a half hearted wave back to him. I really wasn’t sure about this guy, and I think he knew it. Something about his non-answers earlier had my alarm bells ringing. Chugging back the last of my coffee, I threw the cup in the trash before heading downstairs to grab a seat on the front deck. I noticed my fellow passengers on the way past, all 3 of them this time. All sitting in the same row of seats. They gave me a little side eye as I walked past, one of them still chowing down on his sausage roll as he stared at me, a look of apprehension in his eyes. What the hell? Why were they so worried about my presence? Brushing it off, I pushed open the door to the deck, and made my way up to the bow, grabbing a seat in the shade provided by the upper deck. There I sat, my leg nervously bouncing up and down, as the ferry began to make a move. I wondered where we were headed this time. Norfolk Island? Auckland? Bloody Antarctica? All I could see ahead of me and out both sides was blue. It gave me the feeling of being stranded in another world. In a lot of ways I suppose I was, the underwater realm beneath me a dark, endless, alien landscape to those of us who dwell above it. I shook my head, not wanting to think about that. The ferry began to pick up speed now, and the winds blew harshly across my face. It was still cold, despite being in the middle of the summer months. I squinted my eyes and shuffled across a couple of rows where I could be at least a little shielded from the harsh sea breeze, and there I kicked back and tried my best to enjoy the ride.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

For ages we sailed, it must have been at least 3 hours at a guess, before I finally began to catch sight of land. It wasn’t long before the iconic Sydney skyline started to come back into view, and I felt at least some relief in the knowledge that we were heading in the direction of some form of normality. The vessel slowed its pace as it rounded the bend into Port Jackson and we began the scenic cruise into Sydney Harbour. Despite the strangeness, I couldn’t help but take in the beauty around me. I had lived here for many years, and I had seen these sights a million times, but they still never failed to take my breath away. My home city truly is beautiful, picture perfect beaches and stretches of crystal blue waters define the natural landscapes, intertwined with lush forest reserves, age old architecture, and the awe inspiring cityscape rising up beyond. The smell of the salty harbour air gave me something of a sense of calm as we sailed past beautiful Watson’s Bay, the Sydney Harbour National Park, Robertsons Point, the Botanical Gardens, and eventually rounding the bend into Circular Quay as the Harbour Bridge and Opera House came into view. It doesn’t matter how many times you’ve seen it, there’s still that same sense of wonder that overcomes you every time you lay eyes on it. I actually managed to crack a smile in that moment, my racing anxious mind finally slowing to a manageable pace. We were back. I was almost home.

Except… I wasn’t. It probably took me longer than I should have, but eventually it dawned on me. Where the hell was everyone? I got up from my seat and I walked around to the port side of the ferry, looking out over Circular Quay, usually packed with tourists and people going about their day by this hour, yet it was eerily empty. I could see random people, just figures, walking between various laneways and side streets in the distance, but nobody walking along the waterfront. The restaurants, normally so busy the lines are out the doors, were all closed. Even the Opera House was strangely deserted, no tourists posing for photos, no tour groups making their rounds. I wondered if perhaps it was a public holiday or something. But no… I didn’t think it was. At least, not as far as I knew. That shouldn’t account for the total lack of tourists in any case.

I continued to pace around the deck, my feet clanging against the metal as I strolled, and I gazed out all over the harbour. There were a few vessels out and about, but even the water traffic was very quiet today. Nowhere near as many boats out as there usually were. The ferry began to slow its pace now, the engine dying down to a low gurgle as we began to swing into Darling Harbour. I glanced out over the oddly still waters as we steadily drifted by the Barangaroo docks, where all this had begun. I was silently hoping perhaps we may be stopping there, but alas, it was not to be. The ferry did indeed stop, however, right there in the middle of the harbour. The vessel lurched backwards, swinging to the left slightly as it came to an abrupt halt, and I steadied myself on a nearby pole as it did. I shot glances all around, wondering what may be the cause of this sudden emergency stop. As I stood there, I began to get the strangest sensation come over me. It was nothing like the creeping dread that had been building over the last 12 hours, it was a sudden, urgent sensation, screaming at me that I was not safe. I stood frozen, clinging to that pole and staring out over the deck, into the deep, murky waters mere feet away. Suddenly, startling me out of my fixation, an announcement over the crackly P.A system…

*“Remain inside the vessel. Attention. Remain inside the vessel. For your own safety, do not go near the water. I repeat, stay away from the water”.*

I leaned back a little upon hearing that. This has gotta be a joke, right? An audible ripple on the surface startled me, and I took a step back. The water was otherwise still, what had caused that? Another barely perceptible splash, and the water began to ever so slightly bubble, right there in that one spot where the ripple had appeared. I slowly stepped back, fearing sudden movements may startle… something… One step… then another… until finally I could feel the port side doorway. I quietly slid open the door, and stepped backwards inside, before sliding it shut again. I turned around, and I froze. All three of my fellow passengers were staring at me, eyes wide with fear. Not concern this time, no, stone cold fear. I didn’t know what to do. I just stared back at them, gesturing with my hands as if to say “what?!” They all turned away as I did so, looking straight ahead, their backs rigid, their hands in their laps. I didn’t know what was going on, but I got the vibe that the expectation was to sit still and be quiet, so I quickly grabbed a seat next to the doorway and steeled myself. As I sat there in my seat, I heard things. It was barely audible at first, but grew slightly louder with each repetition. A soft banging sound, emanating from below the vessel.

***Bwoonngggg!***

It echoed throughout the cabin. I glanced outside, hoping to catch sight of something. Anything that might give me a clue as to what was going on.

***Bwoonngggg!***

There it was again, louder this time. It was as though there was something heavy floating under or around the ship, bashing into it periodically. But here’s the troubling part, it was clearly impacting a different area of the ferry each time it happened. Something was down there, intentionally slamming into us.

***Bwoonngggg!***

For many long hours, I and my fellow riders sat there, still as statues, as this… whatever it was… slammed itself into the boat over and over. Occasionally, I could feel us tipping backwards, or to the side ever so slightly, and I silently prayed that whatever was doing this did not possess the force necessary to tip this floating nightmare into the harbour where it awaited. I wanted off this ferry, but not that way. The hours ticked on by, and as night began to settle in over Sydney, our knocking menace finally left us be. I couldn’t be sure, but I could have sworn as the ferry’s engines powered up once again, I saw a clearly defined slipstream catapulting away into the dark waters in front of us. Maybe it was just my imagination, or a trick of the light, but honestly? I don’t think so…

The ferry began chugging away again, and at this point I was all but convinced I was still not getting off this thing. It had been almost 24 hours by this point. This time last night, I was still slaving away in the office, and as I thought back to that, I’d have given anything to be back there again. I glanced over at my 3 fellow travellers, still sitting there in that same row of seats, one of them with his head in his hands, shaking his head from side to side. I decided to try my luck and just talk to them, I really wasn’t sure how approachable they were, so I’d held off until now. But I wanted answers. I got up from my seat and walked on over to their side of the ship, sitting down one row behind them. I spoke up…

*“I’m just gonna ask… do any of you have any idea what’s going on?”*

They stayed silent, their eyes facing straight ahead, not moving at all. I focussed my attention on the one guy who was acting a little differently from the rest, his head still in his hands, his hands clearly shaking now…

*“Mate… please… this is clearly not normal. Whatever is happening here, it’s* ***not normal!*** *Please! I just want to know what’s happening!”*

The man lifted his head from his hands, and slowly turned around to face me. I could see his eyes were red and wet. He was quite a young man, in stark contrast to the older two beside him. He looked like he wanted to say something, but was holding back.

*“Please man… please! What’s going on?! Where is this ferry going?!”*

He quietly stared for a moment, before speaking up…

*“To the end of the line…”*

He spoke these words softly, yet with a tone of finality, before turning back around, and facing straight ahead like the rest of his group.

With a groaning creak, the ferry took a sharp left, adjusting its heading toward the Parramatta River. I sat there in a state of shock. I tried once again to get the attention of any of these guys, but with no luck. Something about the way he said what he did suggested that this “end of the line” was not a place I wanted to end up. I got up from my seat and left them be, making my way to one of the front rows of seats again, resting my head against the glass, and just… watching…

A strong wind began to pick up outside, and the ferry was swaying softly from side to side, its metal construction straining and creaking as it drifted slowly down river. As I watched out my window, I noticed things that just… didn’t make sense. Things were in their place, kind of. I had sailed down this river many times for work functions and what not, and everything I was seeing was technically where it was meant to be… But, what was there, was entirely wrong. A mass of tidal trees, right there where they should be, yet different. Gnarly were their forms, twisted and lanky. Not the beautiful green canopy I was used to, but a looming mess of spindly dead limbs which seemed to reach out for our vessel as it slowly made its way past. A few of them even scraped along the side of the ferry as we went, sending out an awful noise not unlike nails on a chalkboard. The houses which lined the river, they were different too. Gone were the beautiful brick constructed riverfront homes which lined the waters. In their place, tall cage-like constructions, their bars rattling in the fierce winds outside, and the water from the murky river lashing up and over them. As we sailed closer to them, I began to notice figures inside these cages. People… at least I think they were. Flailing around from side to side, splashing through the shallow waters of the riverbanks which these enormous cages sunk into. They waved their hands as the boat sailed by, as if trying to get somebody’s attention. I turned away from the window when we sailed close enough by them that I got a good look at their faces. They were terrifying, their expressions distorted into scowls with a burning anger deep in their eyes.

I got up from my seat, deciding to once again try to raise someone’s attention. I ran up the stairs, making my way to the entrance to the Captain’s quarters. As I got to the door, I noticed the internal privacy shield was down, and I could see inside this time. I saw only a man facing straight ahead, much like the other passengers. But this man was not nervous. He stood firm, his composure rock solid. I once again tried knocking on the door, screaming at him to open up and help me, but his focus did not break. He had one job, it seemed, to drive this ferry, and nothing was going to stop him. Defeated, I wandered back to the rear of the upper deck, taking a seat by the Portside windows. I could do nothing but sit and watch as we traversed further and further into the darkness. As we sailed, I noticed yet another strange figure. Not in the cages this time, no, just walking along the riverside, navigating around those awful trees as it made its way along. Eventually, it took a turn, walking down to the riverside. I watched as this person… or this thing… took slow steps out along a strange wooden pier, something that looked like it was built in the 50s. And there they stood.

I knew what was coming, but I didn’t want to believe it. My heart skipped a beat as the ferry swung a hard left, and began pulling in to dock at this rickety old jetty. As we pulled in closer, I could see this person’s face more clearly. It was a relatively young man, perhaps mid 30s, and he was shaking. Whether from the cold or out of fear, I did not know. I shuddered as a terrible grinding noise rang out as the ferry scraped against the old jetty. A clang from below, and I looked out to see a well built man wheeling a ramp out onto the wooden docks. It was the same guy from last night, the one I had resolved to keep clear of. But where the hell had he been?! I hadn’t seen him at all since I boarded.

***Bwooooooom! Bwooooooom!***

Another two blasts from the ferry’s horn, followed by a stern voice through the P.A…

*“DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL!”*

My heart was racing. This was my chance! I looked down, watching as the young man shuffled his way across the ramp, the ferry bouncing up and down threatening to dunk it into the water at any moment. I got up from my seat, and started making my way downstairs.

*“DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL!”*

To hell with that. I picked up my pace, running down the stairs, my only goal to get the hell off this forsaken boat. I gave no thought to the strangeness outside, to this twisted otherworldly plain which awaited me, all I knew was that step one was getting myself off this thing. I broke into a sprint when I hit the bottom floor, dashing toward the doors, when suddenly…

***SMACK!***

I ran straight into the boarding passenger. I stepped back, my plight pointless now, as the gates slammed shut and the ferry began to pull away into the night. The man stared at me, his eyes wide, and clearly shot with fear. The look in his eyes as he saw me, it was like he was staring his own death in the face. It was haunting. He grabbed on to my arms suddenly, and I tried to pull away, asking him what the hell he was doing! He simply stared at me, as he gripped me tight, and asked…

*“HOW… are you here?!”*

Before I could get a single word out, he turned and ran upstairs. In shock, I just stood there for a moment, watching as “ramp guy” slammed the contraption back against the wall and stormed off to the back of the ship. Shaking myself back into the moment, I turned and I ran upstairs, following that guy… And I froze.

There he stood. Right there just beyond the top of the stairs in the aisle… just staring. He didn’t look scared anymore. No, he scared ***me***. His face, the best I can describe it is devoid. Devoid of emotion, devoid of expression… devoid of life. He was completely and totally still, staring straight ahead. Not at me, just straight ahead into thin air. I slowly approached the guy, waving my hand in front of his face. No response. I tapped his shoulder, trying to raise any sign of life. Nothing. Very carefully, I tiptoed around to the side of him, keeping my eyes locked on him at all times. I was just about to back away, when in that moment, his head snapped toward me…

***“ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?!”***

Jesus Christ! His voice was… awful! Deep and distorted, and his eyes full of sheer hatred. I stumbled back, almost toppling down the stairs. I grabbed at the rail, trying to keep my composure as I stepped backwards. As I did so, he took measured paces toward me, coming closer and closer. I turned, and I ran. Grabbing the side of the wall, I pivoted around the corner, making a beeline to the ferry’s lavatory. I could hear his footsteps, still coming down the stairs as I ripped open the bathroom door and hurled myself inside, locking the door behind me.

And there I stayed. Listening to this thing, for a human being I was now convinced it was not, knocking on the door… all throughout the night.",1,1737274991.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1i4txpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1i4txpb/gas_hob_issues/,Gas hob issues,"Hi all,

Apologies this might be the most rediculous question ever asked here. This is the definition of operator error but I'm hoping you can help. 

I seem to lately not be able to turn on the gas hob for about 10-15 tries and I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. I know it's operator error because my flatmate has no such issues. This is also a new one for me as I've been using a gas hob fine for decades!

I'm wondering if someone would be able to explain the mechanics of how these are supposed to turn on. Am I pushing to softly or too hard maybe? Is it supposed to be in a certain position to be safe to stay lit?

It's an electric lighter where the left (9oclock) is off, hightest gas position is bottom (6 oclock)  and smallest is about 1oclock. The light seems to start clicking at the 9oclock.

My method (which I swear worked before) is push down for clicking at 9 oclock and move to about 4/5 oclock wait a few clicks and presto fire-o! This is no longer working. My flatmate has tried to work with me on this to no avail and I'm losing it because I like a stove top coffee in the morning, but this is a stressful way to start the day! It also happens at other times of the day....

Any feed back or knowledge would be most welcome.",0,1737274954.0,AskCulinary,1,0.5,False

It was a rather slow realisation as I awoke to a new day, the crushing truth that none of this had been a dream slowly dawning on me as I awoke to the sound of waves lashing against the upper floor windows. It was then that my sleepy state rapidly subsided, and I recalled every awful detail of the previous night. With the effects of last night’s alcohol consumption largely wearing off by this stage, little things began to come back to me. The first notable image which ran through my mind with renewed clarity, was the arrival of this mysterious ferry at Balmain East, near on midnight. It was clear to me now there were definitely not supposed to be any ferries running back this way at that time. And furthermore, something about the vessel didn’t look right. The ferries of Sydney Harbour have a distinct green and yellow look to them.

The ferry began to pick up speed now, and the winds blew harshly across my face. It was still cold, despite being in the middle of the summer months. I squinted my eyes and shuffled across a couple of rows where I could be at least a little shielded from the harsh sea breeze, and there I kicked back and tried my best to enjoy the ride.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

For ages we sailed, it must have been at least 3 hours at a guess, before I finally began to catch sight of land. It wasn’t long before the iconic Sydney skyline started to come back into view, and I felt at least some relief in the knowledge that we were heading in the direction of some form of normality. The vessel slowed its pace as it rounded the bend into Port Jackson and we began the scenic cruise into Sydney Harbour. Despite the strangeness, I couldn’t help but take in the beauty around me. I had lived here for many years, and I had seen these sights a million times, but they still never failed to take my breath away. My home city truly is beautiful, picture perfect beaches and stretches of crystal blue waters define the natural landscapes, intertwined with lush forest reserves, age old architecture, and the awe inspiring cityscape rising up beyond. The smell of the salty harbour air gave me something of a sense of calm as we sailed past beautiful Watson’s Bay, the Sydney Harbour National Park, Robertsons Point, the Botanical Gardens, and eventually rounding the bend into Circular Quay as the Harbour Bridge and Opera House came into view. It doesn’t matter how many times you’ve seen it, there’s still that same sense of wonder that overcomes you every time you lay eyes on it. I actually managed to crack a smile in that moment, my racing anxious mind finally slowing to a manageable pace. We were back. I was almost home.

Except… I wasn’t. It probably took me longer than I should have, but eventually it dawned on me. Where the hell was everyone? I got up from my seat and I walked around to the port side of the ferry, looking out over Circular Quay, usually packed with tourists and people going about their day by this hour, yet it was eerily empty. I could see random people, just figures, walking between various laneways and side streets in the distance, but nobody walking along the waterfront. The restaurants, normally so busy the lines are out the doors, were all closed. Even the Opera House was strangely deserted, no tourists posing for photos, no tour groups making their rounds. I wondered if perhaps it was a public holiday or something. But no… I didn’t think it was. At least, not as far as I knew. That shouldn’t account for the total lack of tourists in any case.

I continued to pace around the deck, my feet clanging against the metal as I strolled, and I gazed out all over the harbour. There were a few vessels out and about, but even the water traffic was very quiet today. Nowhere near as many boats out as there usually were. The ferry began to slow its pace now, the engine dying down to a low gurgle as we began to swing into Darling Harbour. I glanced out over the oddly still waters as we steadily drifted by the Barangaroo docks, where all this had begun. I was silently hoping perhaps we may be stopping there, but alas, it was not to be. The ferry did indeed stop, however, right there in the middle of the harbour. The vessel lurched backwards, swinging to the left slightly as it came to an abrupt halt, and I steadied myself on a nearby pole as it did. I shot glances all around, wondering what may be the cause of this sudden emergency stop. As I stood there, I began to get the strangest sensation come over me. It was nothing like the creeping dread that had been building over the last 12 hours, it was a sudden, urgent sensation, screaming at me that I was not safe. I stood frozen, clinging to that pole and staring out over the deck, into the deep, murky waters mere feet away. Suddenly, startling me out of my fixation, an announcement over the crackly P.A system…

*“Remain inside the vessel. Attention. Remain inside the vessel. For your own safety, do not go near the water. I repeat, stay away from the water”.*

I leaned back a little upon hearing that. This has gotta be a joke, right? An audible ripple on the surface startled me, and I took a step back. The water was otherwise still, what had caused that? Another barely perceptible splash, and the water began to ever so slightly bubble, right there in that one spot where the ripple had appeared. I slowly stepped back, fearing sudden movements may startle… something… One step… then another… until finally I could feel the port side doorway. I quietly slid open the door, and stepped backwards inside, before sliding it shut again. I turned around, and I froze. All three of my fellow passengers were staring at me, eyes wide with fear. Not concern this time, no, stone cold fear. I didn’t know what to do. I just stared back at them, gesturing with my hands as if to say “what?!” They all turned away as I did so, looking straight ahead, their backs rigid, their hands in their laps. I didn’t know what was going on, but I got the vibe that the expectation was to sit still and be quiet, so I quickly grabbed a seat next to the doorway and steeled myself. As I sat there in my seat, I heard things. It was barely audible at first, but grew slightly louder with each repetition. A soft banging sound, emanating from below the vessel.

***Bwoonngggg!***

It echoed throughout the cabin. I glanced outside, hoping to catch sight of something. Anything that might give me a clue as to what was going on.

***Bwoonngggg!***

There it was again, louder this time. It was as though there was something heavy floating under or around the ship, bashing into it periodically. But here’s the troubling part, it was clearly impacting a different area of the ferry each time it happened. Something was down there, intentionally slamming into us.

***Bwoonngggg!***

For many long hours, I and my fellow riders sat there, still as statues, as this… whatever it was… slammed itself into the boat over and over. Occasionally, I could feel us tipping backwards, or to the side ever so slightly, and I silently prayed that whatever was doing this did not possess the force necessary to tip this floating nightmare into the harbour where it awaited. I wanted off this ferry, but not that way. The hours ticked on by, and as night began to settle in over Sydney, our knocking menace finally left us be. I couldn’t be sure, but I could have sworn as the ferry’s engines powered up once again, I saw a clearly defined slipstream catapulting away into the dark waters in front of us. Maybe it was just my imagination, or a trick of the light, but honestly? I don’t think so…

The ferry began chugging away again, and at this point I was all but convinced I was still not getting off this thing. It had been almost 24 hours by this point. This time last night, I was still slaving away in the office, and as I thought back to that, I’d have given anything to be back there again. I glanced over at my 3 fellow travellers, still sitting there in that same row of seats, one of them with his head in his hands, shaking his head from side to side. I decided to try my luck and just talk to them, I really wasn’t sure how approachable they were, so I’d held off until now. But I wanted answers. I got up from my seat and walked on over to their side of the ship, sitting down one row behind them. I spoke up…

*“I’m just gonna ask… do any of you have any idea what’s going on?”*

They stayed silent, their eyes facing straight ahead, not moving at all. I focussed my attention on the one guy who was acting a little differently from the rest, his head still in his hands, his hands clearly shaking now…

*“Mate… please… this is clearly not normal. Whatever is happening here, it’s* ***not normal!*** *Please! I just want to know what’s happening!”*

The man lifted his head from his hands, and slowly turned around to face me. I could see his eyes were red and wet. He was quite a young man, in stark contrast to the older two beside him. He looked like he wanted to say something, but was holding back.

*“Please man… please! What’s going on?! Where is this ferry going?!”*

He quietly stared for a moment, before speaking up…

*“To the end of the line…”*

He spoke these words softly, yet with a tone of finality, before turning back around, and facing straight ahead like the rest of his group.

With a groaning creak, the ferry took a sharp left, adjusting its heading toward the Parramatta River. I sat there in a state of shock. I tried once again to get the attention of any of these guys, but with no luck. Something about the way he said what he did suggested that this “end of the line” was not a place I wanted to end up. I got up from my seat and left them be, making my way to one of the front rows of seats again, resting my head against the glass, and just… watching…

A strong wind began to pick up outside, and the ferry was swaying softly from side to side, its metal construction straining and creaking as it drifted slowly down river. As I watched out my window, I noticed things that just… didn’t make sense. Things were in their place, kind of. I had sailed down this river many times for work functions and what not, and everything I was seeing was technically where it was meant to be… But, what was there, was entirely wrong. A mass of tidal trees, right there where they should be, yet different. Gnarly were their forms, twisted and lanky. Not the beautiful green canopy I was used to, but a looming mess of spindly dead limbs which seemed to reach out for our vessel as it slowly made its way past. A few of them even scraped along the side of the ferry as we went, sending out an awful noise not unlike nails on a chalkboard. The houses which lined the river, they were different too. Gone were the beautiful brick constructed riverfront homes which lined the waters. In their place, tall cage-like constructions, their bars rattling in the fierce winds outside, and the water from the murky river lashing up and over them. As we sailed closer to them, I began to notice figures inside these cages. People… at least I think they were. Flailing around from side to side, splashing through the shallow waters of the riverbanks which these enormous cages sunk into. They waved their hands as the boat sailed by, as if trying to get somebody’s attention. I turned away from the window when we sailed close enough by them that I got a good look at their faces. They were terrifying, their expressions distorted into scowls with a burning anger deep in their eyes.

I got up from my seat, deciding to once again try to raise someone’s attention. I ran up the stairs, making my way to the entrance to the Captain’s quarters. As I got to the door, I noticed the internal privacy shield was down, and I could see inside this time. I saw only a man facing straight ahead, much like the other passengers. But this man was not nervous. He stood firm, his composure rock solid. I once again tried knocking on the door, screaming at him to open up and help me, but his focus did not break. He had one job, it seemed, to drive this ferry, and nothing was going to stop him. Defeated, I wandered back to the rear of the upper deck, taking a seat by the Portside windows. I could do nothing but sit and watch as we traversed further and further into the darkness. As we sailed, I noticed yet another strange figure. Not in the cages this time, no, just walking along the riverside, navigating around those awful trees as it made its way along. Eventually, it took a turn, walking down to the riverside. I watched as this person… or this thing… took slow steps out along a strange wooden pier, something that looked like it was built in the 50s. And there they stood.

I knew what was coming, but I didn’t want to believe it. My heart skipped a beat as the ferry swung a hard left, and began pulling in to dock at this rickety old jetty. As we pulled in closer, I could see this person’s face more clearly. It was a relatively young man, perhaps mid 30s, and he was shaking. Whether from the cold or out of fear, I did not know. I shuddered as a terrible grinding noise rang out as the ferry scraped against the old jetty. A clang from below, and I looked out to see a well built man wheeling a ramp out onto the wooden docks. It was the same guy from last night, the one I had resolved to keep clear of. But where the hell had he been?! I hadn’t seen him at all since I boarded.

***Bwooooooom! Bwooooooom!***

Another two blasts from the ferry’s horn, followed by a stern voice through the P.A…

*“DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL!”*

My heart was racing. This was my chance! I looked down, watching as the young man shuffled his way across the ramp, the ferry bouncing up and down threatening to dunk it into the water at any moment. I got up from my seat, and started making my way downstairs.

*“DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL! DO NOT EXIT THE VESSEL!”*

To hell with that. I picked up my pace, running down the stairs, my only goal to get the hell off this forsaken boat. I gave no thought to the strangeness outside, to this twisted otherworldly plain which awaited me, all I knew was that step one was getting myself off this thing. I broke into a sprint when I hit the bottom floor, dashing toward the doors, when suddenly…

***SMACK!***

I ran straight into the boarding passenger. I stepped back, my plight pointless now, as the gates slammed shut and the ferry began to pull away into the night. The man stared at me, his eyes wide, and clearly shot with fear. The look in his eyes as he saw me, it was like he was staring his own death in the face. It was haunting. He grabbed on to my arms suddenly, and I tried to pull away, asking him what the hell he was doing! He simply stared at me, as he gripped me tight, and asked…

*“HOW… are you here?!”*

Before I could get a single word out, he turned and ran upstairs. In shock, I just stood there for a moment, watching as “ramp guy” slammed the contraption back against the wall and stormed off to the back of the ship. Shaking myself back into the moment, I turned and I ran upstairs, following that guy… And I froze.

There he stood. Right there just beyond the top of the stairs in the aisle… just staring. He didn’t look scared anymore. No, he scared ***me***. His face, the best I can describe it is devoid. Devoid of emotion, devoid of expression… devoid of life. He was completely and totally still, staring straight ahead. Not at me, just straight ahead into thin air. I slowly approached the guy, waving my hand in front of his face. No response. I tapped his shoulder, trying to raise any sign of life. Nothing. Very carefully, I tiptoed around to the side of him, keeping my eyes locked on him at all times. I was just about to back away, when in that moment, his head snapped toward me…

***“ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?!”***

Jesus Christ! His voice was… awful! Deep and distorted, and his eyes full of sheer hatred. I stumbled back, almost toppling down the stairs. I grabbed at the rail, trying to keep my composure as I stepped backwards. As I did so, he took measured paces toward me, coming closer and closer. I turned, and I ran. Grabbing the side of the wall, I pivoted around the corner, making a beeline to the ferry’s lavatory. I could hear his footsteps, still coming down the stairs as I ripped open the bathroom door and hurled myself inside, locking the door behind me.

And there I stayed. Listening to this thing, for a human being I was now convinced it was not, knocking on the door… all throughout the night.",1,1737274801.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

In the past, keto was fairly easy for me to stick to, I had successes, and a side effect was that it completely got rid of my heavy bleeding. Prior to keto the first time around, I had such heavy periods I have been hospitalised twice, and needed blood transfusions. That bad! On keto I was experiencing normal periods 2-3 days a month. Also, weight management is imp for my gyn issues. My doctor wants me to lose 40 kgs!! Anyway, I say this to show I have more than one reason to address my eating.

I travel a lot for work, internationally, and that’s when everything falls over. I am often in regions who dgaf or don’t understand what I’m trying to stick to! And my days are outrageously long and exhausting I’m out of whack.  That’s a bunch of context for you all!

So, I’ve been eating low carb since early Dec - Christmas and New Years aside - and just begun to IF. I’ve never done before really, but once upon a time I did a lazy version where I just narrowed my eating window to 8 hours. That can be easy for me to do, as long as I’m organised. The past few days I’ve been so busy I’ve been 18/6. I have one big meal (coffee, big cheesy omelette with spinach, ham and avo) to break my fast, and today as it was just 6 hours I had a small meal (keto ‘granola’ and yoghurt) My questions are:

Is there a preferred time of day that I should be fasting / is there a recommended meal I should be prioritising (ie breakfast)? Or something in relation to my own sleep patterns?

Secondly, I would love to hear your anecdotal experiences and personal recommendations around what I as a middle aged woman should be working towards. I’ve had conflicting advice from different ‘experts’ incl our family doctor, three different nutritionists and my keto mad PT at the gym. So I’ve decided to “shop around”, with the intent to ease myself into any changes, monitor the essential stuff through my doctor, and do what practically seems to be working. 

What might the ultimate IF goal to get to? I see people saying “30 hours fasting” and my keto mad mate will go do some bizarre carb loading and then fast for 3 days. I’m not personally looking for extreme, I just want to shift weight off my belly and arms, regulate my periods and avoid my Dr and his diabetes meds if possible!

Would love to hear what has worked for other women… which is mostly why I’m here, to lurk at others’ journeys.",1,1737274734.0,intermittentfasting,0,0.67,False

It’s early. *Very* early. But all according to plan. Buck sneaks a glance to his right, seeing the brown tuft of hair sticking out from the covers next to him. He smiles to himself, before sneakily scurrying out of the bedroom and headed towards the kitchen.

He pulls out his phone.

*3 unread messages, 100% battery, March 4th, 5:30 AM*

It’s their fifth wedding anniversary. The photo album from their wedding is already on the kitchen counter, but Buck has no time for beautiful distractions. Eddie must have put it there… Smart man, he knows Buck can’t resist looking through it sometime during the day. They always have time off work for their anniversary, and he is going to make an amazing breakfast for Eddie to have in bed.

Six years as a couple, five years married. It’s crazy how fast time flies by. March fourth is still Buck’s favorite day, especially because of their anniversary. Every year they write each other a letter where they declare their love. Every year it has Buck bawling. This year won’t be different. He has a sneaking suspicion of where Eddie put his letter.

Buck can’t resist anymore. He opens the photo album. He flips through the pages to his favorite picture. The picture that always takes his breath away. The two of them at the altar on the beach, a kiss he never wanted to end. Both smiling softly. The sun basks them in a golden glow. And exactly where the letter is.

Through thick and thin, sickness and health, whatever may come, they have each other. For every heartbreak Buck had to endure, it all led up to this. Loving the man he will spend eternity with.

Everything’s prepped and ready. Tray full of food, perfect coffee, a small gift, a letter addressed to one Mr Eddie Diaz, and one letter addressed to one Mr Evan Buckley-Diaz. More fun reading them together.

Buck carries the tray with ease, a grin he can’t contain spreading across his face, and he knocks on the bedroom door before gently pushing it open.

“Happy anniversary, Eddie.” he gleefully says, stepping into the room. “Now, I know it’s a bit early, but I figured we could-” Buck looks up as he places the tray down on his side of the bed.

Eddie is quiet. *Too* quiet.

“Eddie?” he asks, leaning over to try and nudge him awake.

Dread is building in Buck quicker than he’s ever felt before.

*“Eds..?”* he whispers, leaning in closer, listening for Eddie’s breath.

He doesn’t hear anything.

Panic takes hold and he brings two fingers to Eddie’s pulse point.

He doesn’t feel anything.

“Eddie. Please wake up. This isn’t funny.” he shakes rougher now, gripping onto Eddie’s shoulder. “Eddie, wake up!”

He can’t breathe, the panic is taking over, his whole body is trembling at the revelation he refuses to acknowledge. He stumbles back out of bed, crashing into the wall before pulling out his phone, dialing 9-1-1.

“Nine, one, one, what is your-”

“I need- I need help. Four nine nine five South Bedford Street. Unresponsive, uh- I’m… please, I need help. M- Male, mid thirties, he uh, he won’t wake up. Help, *please.*” Buck barely manages to croak out, biting the back of his hand to try and stifle the sobs threatening to escape the back of his throat.

“... Evan?”

The sob escapes, *“M-M-Maddie..?”* he barely gets out before sliding down against the wall, pulling his knees up, burying his face in them to soak up the tears.

“Evan, have you checked for a pulse-”

“Yeah, I- I have. Just send someone, please.”

“They’re nearly there, just… Evan, please, listen to me. It’s going to be okay.”

Buck drops his phone as he wails over the loss. Cries and sobs echoing through the empty house. A pain so severe he’ll never recover. His heart broken beyond repair. His soul dwindling rapidly. This is it. The heartbreak that will destroy him. He knew it would happen one day. He just wished every night that someday would come after eternity.

He crawls into bed, pulling Eddie’s lifeless body tightly into his, holding onto him for as long as he can, kissing his forehead. His tears never stop, his cries never dry up. The love of his life is gone, and so is his love for life.

The agony is all encompassing, his entire body emanating pain and sorrow so deep he doesn’t see a bottom to it. His throat aches at the screams ripping themselves out. His eyes burn at the pressure building up.

Everything is a blur. Time is fleeting. His body is on autopilot. He’s a passenger in his own body. There are people, people are talking, words are said but nothing registers. Nothing registers except for the pain, except for the loss. He’s suddenly on the couch, staring blankly ahead. Someone moved him here, but he doesn’t know who. It doesn’t matter.

Bobby’s next to him. He’s talking to him, saying kind words. He’s explaining what happened. He says Eddie had a stroke in his sleep. Nothing anyone could’ve done. He’s trying to help. But there’s no helping anymore. Bobby disappears.

He calls Christopher. Christopher says he’s coming home, he can do his classes online. He doesn’t want Buck to do anything stupid. Buck knows that’s what he actually means.

Athena hands him a letter.

Buck opens it with trembling hands. He dreads this. They were supposed to read them together. It's more fun that way.

*Dear Evan,*

*Life was never easy for us.*

*We always had our struggles. We will always have our struggles.*

*Life would beat us down time upon time again.*

*But we’d always get back up.*

*Life might not be easy, but being with you always is.*

*You always make me smile, you always make me laugh, you always remind me life is worth living, despite how hard it is sometimes.*

*Your love saved me, it changed me.*

*If I had to go through everything I did to be with you again, I wouldn’t even hesitate. All the pain and misery that made me lead me to you, a love I could never imagine deserving. Yet here you are, a neverending font of love, and I will drink of it forever.*

*You are the star in the north-sky, my true north. You guide me through the dark, and pull me out of the depths. The strength of your love keeps me safe, sane and filled with bliss. I am so lucky that I have you by my side.*

*You told me I make you happy by just existing. You told me you would wait an eternity for me. Until every star in the night sky burned out.*

*Then let’s be happy in each other’s existence. Let’s be together for eternity. Let’s watch the last star in the night sky burn out together.*

*I’m here, with you.*

*Always.*

*Love, Eddie*

Buck feels a hand squeeze his shoulder and looks up from the tear stained letter. No one’s there. He glances over to the window. For a brief second he imagines Eddie standing by his side in the reflection, smiling a somber yet loving smile.

Buck smiles at the thought, placing his hand where he felt the squeeze. A hand lays on top of his. But no one’s there.

1i4tvk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1i4tvk2/grieving_very_short_term_25_months_relationship/,Grieving very short term (2.5 months) 'relationship'. Unsure how to proceed ,"Really struggling at the moment and looking for any sort of advice on how to deal with this situation I'm in.

Mid November last year, I met the most incredible woman. I'm 37M and she's 36. We instantly clicked and felt this deep connection that neither of us had ever felt before. I have been in multiple relationships in my life, have also been engaged and never felt anything like this. 

My last few relationships were very toxic, including my engagement. I was really hurt in all of them. This was different. This was the first time in my life I felt truly safe with someone. I felt this sense of peace and calmness from this woman that I've never felt before. She absolutely loved everything about me, and it felt amazing. I felt seen, heard and understood for the first time in my life. 

She's honestly everything I've ever wanted in a partner. She's extremely sweet, caring, loving, kind, empathetic, bubbly, incredibly intelligent,  hard working, very family oriented and has the same sense of humour as me. 

We both felt this sense of familiarity, as though we've known each other forever. It's so strange. Things moved so quickly, and I found myself acting out of character and so was she. The things we would say to each other, the way we acted around each other, etc.

We would spend hours on the phone together and chat daily, whether it was via text or phone call. We were both so drawn to each other.

I was starting to feel crazy as it felt like I was falling in love with someone I barely knew, and I could sense the same from her. 

Around Christmas Day, she experienced a family issue that she wouldn't tell me about, but it left her feeling extremely upset. When I tried to talk to her about it, she just said she couldn't talk about it and wasn't ready to talk about it yet. The only person she had spoken to about it was her brother. I respected this and just let her know I'm here to listen whenever she's ready.

I could see she was falling into depression, but she kept saying how talking to me and being with me felt so good and made her forget about everything. She did mention a few times that she felt bad because she wasn't giving me the best version of herself and this isn't like her. She said it feels like meeting the right person at the wrong time. Despite this, things were really good between us until a week ago. 

She was feeling really down that day. We went out later that evening but the vibe wasn't the best, but she was still really sweet with me. I took her out to dinner followed by coffee and a walk along the beach. 

Later that evening when I got home, I felt crap coz I felt like I didn't do enough to lift her mood so I texted her. We texted back and forth and she mentioned how she still feels so bad and she can't explain it. She said how it's eating her up inside coz she wants to give me the world but she can't. She said she realised she wasn't mentally able to give me herself at this point and that she realised that after that night. I asked if that meant she wanted space from me. She said she didn't really want to but maybe it was for the best. 

I tried to let her know that it wasn't affecting me and that I was happy to have her in my life, but she decided that space was for the best so that she could sort herself out. I didn't want to push it so I told her I respected her wishes and to take all the time she needs and that I'm here when she's ready to talk again. 

Fast forward to Monday, I sent her a text with a picture of a coffee cup with latte art with her name, something I did for her often as she loved them, and I added the caption 'thinking of you'.

She liked the message and replied 'there's so much I want to say but can't'. I asked her why, and she said that things were getting worse and she didn't want to be wasting my time by me hanging around waiting for her.

I sent her a message back saying that if she believes I'm the right guy for her then there is no wrong time because the right person will meet you in the midst of chaos and sit with you through it. I told her I was right where I want to be and didn't want to go anywhere. 

I told her that I'm happy to support her in any way she needs and if that means giving her space to process her emotions then that's totally fine, I was simply checking in to let her know I was thinking of her. 

She replied, 'I appreciate these messages and you more than you know but I can’t comprehend processing any feelings while I know you are giving me space and waiting for me.. which is a  vicious cycle of guilt and selfishness and I seriously don’t think I can handle that right now. Please don’t hold back and moving on would be the right thing to do. If our paths cross and it’s meant to be.. it’s meant to be🌹'

I'll be honest this response hurt me a lot, but I simply replied with:

 'That's fair enough, I respect how you feel.Whatever you're dealing with, I genuinely hope it all works out and you find yourself again. If you need anything I'm a phone call away 🌹'

It's now Sunday and there has been no contact since. I'm honestly struggling really bad. We still have each other on socials, so I don't think she's ghosting me and I'm fairly sure she's being genuine, but it's honestly hard to know what's true or isn't anymore. My past experiences haven't been the best.

I feel silly for even making this thread as I only knew this girl for 2.5 months, but I can't help it. She genuinely made me feel more in that time than anyone else has in any length of time. The connection we shared during this time was incredible. I had the best new years I've ever had with her. Is it normal to be grieving this bad over such a short encounter?

Normally I would simply let this go and move onto the next, but I can't this time. My heart is honestly in pieces and my mind is struggling to come to terms with how we can be so close one minute, speaking every single day, can't get enough of each other, to not speaking at all. It's so jarring and I'm sitting here wondering what the fuck I've experienced. Did I get love bombed? Possible avoidant? I just can't fathom willingly walking away from someone completely if I felt they were perfect for me like she claims, regardless of what I was going through. That's just me.

Im giving her space, but would it be a bad idea to send a short message checking in with her in a week or 2? Something simple like, 'Just wanted to check in on you. I hope you're doing okay. You're in my prayers always' (I'm a religious person just FYI). I'm just finding it hard to completely walk away from this.

1i4tvia,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1i4tvia/a_private_but_not_secret_relationship_my_2024/,A Private but Not Secret Relationship (My 2024 Plot Twist),"This is my first time posting here, so please bear with me.

I met this guy in one of my general subjects last August. He’s not the kind of guy who immediately turns heads in terms of physical looks, but he’s very well-spoken and an absolute gentleman. I usually go to class early (about an hour before), and he’s often there at the same time. While waiting, we’d have small chats.

It all started when he asked me to grab some coffee while we were waiting for class. I said yes since I was planning to get coffee anyway. I was ahead of him in line, and when it was my turn to order, I was about to pull out my wallet to pay  when, to my surprise, he stopped me and handed his card to the cashier to pay for my order. After that, we started getting coffee together regularly, but he didn’t like it when I offer to treat him in return. So, I started buying our coffee before he arrived to make sure he had no choice but to let me treat him.

One time, after class, he asked me out on a date. When we got to his car before leaving school, I was shocked when he asked for my parents’ phone numbers. He actually called my mom and dad to introduce himself and let them know I was with him. I mean, I’m allowed to go on dates, but I was surprised by how formal and respectful he was. Since then, we’ve been going on dates regularly, but every time, he texts my parents to let them know where we’re going and what time we’ll be going home.

He's a very private, low-key, and down-to-earth person. At first, I asked him why he’s always dressed in corporate attire, and he casually mentioned that he’s a working student. Later on, I found out that his family owns a group of car dealerships that sell various car brands, and he manages one of their dealerships.

He is also a very shy person and for some reason we dont talk to each other that much at school (we're from different programs) its more of like we just talk pag magkasama kami ng kaming dalawa lang or magkikita kami sa parking na. Our friends and classmates dont know na we're dating outside.

We’ve continued dating, especially after the semester ended in December, and we’ve gotten to know each other even better. We’re the type of people who don’t post much on social media or rarely share stories in IG. But one time this January (during New Year), I posted an Instagram story of us together, and my DMs literally exploded. Our classmates were shocked and didn’t expect that we were dating.

Two days ago, he asked me to be his girlfriend, and of course, I said yes! That night, the photo we took together became his very first Instagram post, and his friends were super shocked that we were dating 🤣

And that’s how my 2024 plot twist happened 😅

1i4tv7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/qelbree/comments/1i4tv7s/concerned_about_the_lack_of_info_from_my/,Concerned about the lack of info from my psychiatrist about this med,"It’s 3am and I’m on the 4th night of being unable to sleep ever since I upped my dose from 100 to 200. I was on 100 for a month and the 200 for just a few days. I decided to check reddit and see if anyone else had insomnia or nausea  and the first post I see is the pinned post warning not to go cold turkey. That led me to read a lot more posts on here. 

Before I started taking this my psychiatrist mentioned on lower doses I may feel more tired. She didn’t mention side effects of  drinking alcohol or being careful with caffeine. She never mentioned that I shouldn’t stop it cold turkey. Now after looking though many of the posts on here, it seems like a lot of people aren’t being told this stuff. I don’t drink coffee so caffeine already affects me pretty strongly. I almost took some Excedrin a couple of days ago due to a migraine and even taking that makes me jittery. I’m so glad I didn’t take it, it’s interesting because I got this gut feeling that it wasn’t a good idea to take it that day. Thank god I didn’t. Tonight I went out and had 2 drinks. I now have weird jittery chills on top of the nausea and insomnia. 

If anything I guess this is a learning experience that I need to ask a lot more questions and research before starting a new med. I trusted my psychiatrist and now I’m pretty upset.",1,1737274635.0,qelbree,0,1.0,False
