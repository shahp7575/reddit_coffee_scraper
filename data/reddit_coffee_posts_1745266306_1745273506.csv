1k4q1jx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k4q1jx/someone_else_is_here/,Someone else is here,"I noticed it first with my keys.

I’ve had the same keychain since college—an old bottle opener from a bar I don’t even remember going to. I never changed it. It’s worn smooth from years in my pocket, the logo faded to almost nothing. But one morning last month, I picked them up from the counter and felt… off.

The keys looked the same, but they didn’t *feel* right. The weight was off, like someone had swapped out the actual keys for copies. One of the teeth on my apartment key was shorter, slightly rounded. But when I tested them—everything worked. Door opened. Mailbox too. So I told myself I was imagining things. Maybe I dropped them, maybe something bent.

That’s how it starts, though. Small enough that you think it’s just stress. Work’s been rough lately, sleep hasn’t been great. So you brush it off.

Then the email came.

It was a receipt for a coffee shop I don’t go to—some indie spot across town. The charge hit my card around 8:42 a.m. I checked my phone’s health app. At that time, I was in the shower. I *remember* being in the shower. But the receipt had my name, my card. Everything matched.

I googled the café. They had a little online ordering system. You could leave a note for the barista.

Mine said: “See you tomorrow.”

I started checking my accounts more often after that. There were more weird purchases. A small charge at a gas station I’ve never been to. A subscription to a language learning app. Someone ordered sushi at 11 p.m. on a Sunday—something I *never* do. The kicker? They ordered what I might *almost* pick. Not my usual, but not something I’d hate either.

I figured maybe my card had been stolen. But then, why were the purchases so… *close*? Too subtle to notice unless I was actively looking.

And then my coworker asked how the concert was.

“What concert?” I asked.

She laughed. “The one you posted about on your story. Looked amazing.”

I never post stories. I barely post at all. I pulled up my account—nothing there.

But I checked my camera roll.

And there were pictures.

Low-quality shots from the back of a crowd. A band I sort of like. Someone had zoomed in, tried to catch the lights, the stage, the vibe. The timestamps matched what my coworker said.

Only problem? I wasn’t there.

I spiraled a little after that. Thought maybe I was sleepwalking. Or maybe dissociating? I’d been stressed, maybe I was blacking out. Losing time. So I did what you’re probably thinking—I set up a camera in my bedroom.

Cheap webcam. Motion-triggered. Just to ease my mind.

The next morning, I checked the footage.

I never left the bed.

But at 3:12 a.m., I sat up.

I sat up perfectly straight. Rigid. And stared at the bedroom door.

Then, without blinking, I said:

I’m a woman in my late 30s, recently out of a long-term marriage to a man. 16 years of deep care, quiet stability, and a kind of love that eventually stopped feeling like a true partnership. In the aftermath, I’ve landed in a queer awakening that feels both overdue and undeniable. I’m not confused. This part of me is real, powerful, and honestly the most alive I’ve ever felt.

This story has a name, but I’ll leave her unnamed. Let’s just say: she’s magnetic, emotionally elusive, brilliantly sharp… and with a man she divorced years ago, then got back together with for “practical reasons.” She’s told me that she sometimes wonders if there’s something different out there. Yes, those were her exact words, shared the first time she visited me at my new place, and followed with, “this stays between us.” That sentence has haunted me ever since.

We’ve known each other for about two years through a shared hobby. From the beginning, there was something. We were never “just” friendly – and still, two years in, I don’t think of her as a friend. It’s the kind of connection that hums below the surface. Over time, it’s turned into this slow-motion, emotionally confusing, borderline-flirty not-quite-anything.

**Examples of the chaos**  
– She’s leaned in physically; arms brushing, small touches, that too-long eye contact… in ways that don’t feel purely platonic (but what even *is* platonic, tbh?)  
– We’ve held hands a few times. Literally. No comment.  
– She once said something clearly flirtatious in a group setting and looked me dead in the eye while saying it, and everyone in the room noticed.  
– Our messages are always threaded with something unspoken; compliments tucked inside offhand remarks, warmth slipped between the lines. She’s told me I look insanely good, that I bring lightness and depth at the same time, that I “take up space in her life in the loveliest way.” She’s said she wants to prioritize time with me, that I’m sweet and sharp and hard to ignore… and yet, somehow, the moments where it could turn into something more just dissolve into silence.

It’s never just casual. It’s never quite clear. And it keeps me caught in this in-between.

From my perspective, she was the one who initiated this. I honestly didn’t catch on for months. But slowly, I began to realize there was something between us. I started responding more openly to her attention, even suggesting we meet for coffee or a glass of wine outside our shared activites. She seemed genuinely into the idea, but when it came time to set a date, she went quiet. I didn’t hear from her for weeks. Then she slowly returned, and neither of us mentioned the silence.

It’s this push-pull loop 🔁  
**flirt – openness – withdrawal – silence – casual re-entry – repeat.**  
And I can’t tell if she’s:  
a) closeted and conflicted  
b) emotionally bored and enjoying the attention  
c) secretly fascinated and scared shitless  
d) none of the above and I’m just projecting like a true late bloomer

I’ve never said anything to her directly. I’ve just… existed in this confusing, beautiful, occasionally painful space where something lives, but I don’t know what. I’m not exactly waiting. But I haven’t let go either.

Has anyone else been in this kind of slow-burn queer fog with someone emotionally unavailable – where you’re constantly walking the line between emotional intimacy and romantic tension, trying not to lose your balance?

And how do you actually tell when someone’s into you, not just curious, not just flattered, not just vibing… but *really* feeling it?

**… aaaaaand before anyone says “just tell her how you feel,”** please tell me *how* to do that without crossing invisible lines or ruining a genuinely lovely connection I truly care about, because honestly, I think she’s kind of awesome and just a really good human.

Any clarity, stories, or “been there, girl” comments are warmly welcome.

**Love from the emotionally tangled side of queerness 💜**

\----------------------  
**TL;DR:**  
Late 30s, freshly gay, post-hetero marriage.  
Met a married woman (divorced then re-married for “practical reasons,” so… you know).  
Two years of intense eye contact, emotional whiplash, hand-holding, suspiciously specific compliments, and flirty silences.  
She starts it. I respond. She ghosts. Then she casually returns like it’s Tuesday.  
Now I’m stuck in a very queer loop: *flirt → hope → silence → mild existential crisis → repeat*.  
Not sure if she’s secretly into me or just enjoying the chaos.  
Not ready to confess my gay yearning and ruin a genuinely lovely connection.

It started last yr, I used to get up once at around 3am to pee and then fall back asleep after, I would normally get 6-7 hrs of sleep but some time last yr, out of no where I would get up about 2-3 time just to pee. I consulted a urologist, gave me Vesicare and Tamsulosin but I think it did not work. I stopped medication and my pee habits went back to normal with some occasional flares. And then recently just start of this yr I went back to 2-3 times but it became much much worse. I would wake up every 1.5hrs, some good flow of pee and some just droplets. I even stopped coffee, soft drinks, etc just to anticipate my triggers but I dont seem to find out the root cause. But one thing I notice, when I go on a long holiday or be in a “very relaxed state”, I sleep really well. I just have to get up once.

1k4puk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1k4puk0/yet_another_single_dose_grinder_recommendation/,Yet another single dose grinder recommendation request [$800],"Hey folks, I have been using my Sette 270wi since 2019 and generally quite happy with it. It's super consistent, the results in the cup are nice, and the workflow couldn't be easier....the issue is the noise. It's such a loud and high pitched, jarring, noise. It's to the point where I sometimes dread running it in the morning because it bothers me so much. I realize it's a bit whiny, but it's time for a change. (For context I also have a baratza encore with the m2 upgrade and it doesn't bother me at all).

I've decided I want to switch to single dosing because I only pull one shot most days so I really don't mind weighing out my shots. I also don't feel the need to ""upgrade"" from the Sette in terms of grind quality as I am perfectly content with the coffee I get from it, though I'm not going to complain if I end up with something better. The biggest things I care about are (in order of importance):

1. Noise level
2. Longevity
3. Consistency
4. Relatively compact size
5. Cost (under $800)

The grinders I've done research on that seem to fit the bill (and my aesthetic sense) are the Niche Zero, the Timemore Sculptor 064s/078s, and the Eureka Mignon Zero or Oro (or the Zero 65). All three of them seem to be pretty much on par in terms of grind quality and on the quieter side of the spectrum (I think).

My concern with the Eurekas is that you see an absolute boat load of refurbished models for sale. Maybe it is due to volume of sales vs. other models, but it seems absolutely crazy how many of them are always for sale at whole latte love and other sources. I don't want to deal with a poorly engineered/built grinder if I don't have to, but I really have no idea if it is just the scale that they are selling at compared to some of these other companies, or maybe just poor QC on a couple models? It just gives me some pause I suppose.

My main concern with the Niche is that it seems to have been mega hyped all over and since then there are a ton more options, so I'm not sure if the price is actually in line with what you get anymore. It seems to meet all of my requirements...I'm just not sure if it is actually worth it?

Finally, the Timemores. This seems to be the best ""bang for your buck"" of these 3 and I must admit it's pretty tempting. I'm mainly skeptical because Timemore is not a super established brand in the long-term (though I suppose that is true for Niche as well) and I worry that they could just disappear and I'd be left with something that can't be serviced in a few years. That and these haven't been on the market for long so who knows how they will hold up in 3-5 years. The Niche has at least been on the market since 2019 and seems like they have had few reliability issues.

Anyway, I'm also open to other suggestions - I am trying really hard to make a practical decision and not a G.A.S. fueled impulse buy here!",3,1745272554.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

We’re all aware of how inefficient and logistically bloated current army nutrition is. MREs are bulky, inconsistent, and wasteful. Hot-As are a logistical joke. DFAC food is hit or miss (mostly miss), constrained by time/distance, and often terribly unhealthy. Soldiers aren’t eating for taste, they’re eating for performance, merit, and **lethality**. So why not streamline it?

**Enter: Super Chow.**  
A nutritionally complete, shelf-stable, *pelletized* ration system optimized for physical readiness and maximum **lethality**.

Each bite-sized pellet (roughly the size of a Milk Dud) contains precise macro- and micronutrient balances in accordance with ATP 4-41 and body composition standards. One 1.5 lb vacuum-sealed bag contains the entire day's caloric needs (3,200 kcal), optimized for 18–25 year old male groundpounders who claim they “don’t need breakfast” and then pass out at the range. Start rustling that bag and troops'll come running.

**Benefits:**

* **Logistics:** A meal’s worth fits in a cargo pocket.
* **Waste:** Fully edible, biodegradable packaging made from compressed kale pulp. 
* **Morale:** No one fights over flavors because there are none in particular. Troop Chow has one flavor: **Lethality***.*
* **Versatility:** Add water? It becomes gruel. Add hot water? It’s warm gravy. Mix with coffee? **Now** you're using your head!
* **Discipline:** No more excuses. You eat your chow, you shut up, you move on.

I’m putting together a white paper and prototype kit. Thinking of pitching it to Natick. Let’s cut the fat. Let’s cut the bullshit. Let’s feed the warfighter like the **lethal** war-machine it is. ",8,1745272191.0,army,6,1.0,False

She was so docile and calm when we met her, and now she is so wired half the time. Sometimes when I pet her, she turns her head and opens her mouth like she would almost bite. It makes me sad because I want a cuddle bug. She also doesn’t lay down and roll over for belly rubs. Sometimes if we pick her up when she is amped up she will actually bite and/or growl. Is all this normal puppy behavior at 16 weeks or does it sound like aggressive behavior? She also was so happy meeting my mom, cuddled with her and loved her instantly. But then she was on my moms lap chewing a chew and my mom adjusted position and Daisy gave a scary growl. Took us all by surprise. 

Also, Took her to a puppy social hour where a trainer watches the puppies interact (no owners allowed for that house so I couldn’t observe). He said Daisy was super forward and almost snapped at a few of the dogs/wouldn’t back down. He said it wasn’t really aggression but something to watch. It all makes me anxious because I have two young kids and the reason we got her was for them. Now I feel like she is too rough to let them play with her without me right there observing and intervening if she stars nipping and biting socks/feet. 
She will seek me out and curl up on my lap and let me pet her a few times a day. Doesn’t seek out the kids laps but they don’t sit still for long. Does this all sound normal for 16 weeks?? Hoping she will calm down and be a great family dog. I’d really thought she was perfect because she was raised around little kids and seemed so chill w them picking her up and cuddling her when we looked at her… 

This was her today, trying to teach her place at home and out, so today we tried to be calm and chill outside of a coffee shop. She barked at some people but otherwise laid down and chewed on her chew. She just has an anxious vibe about her I didn’t pick up when we first saw her.",4,1745271300.0,Maltipoo,3,1.0,False

We are remodelling our kitchen. We have settled for Ikea cabinetry. The appliances in the picture are placeholders. The actual appliances are not Ikea, but will be in those spots. It will be an oven, steam oven, over the range microwave, induction cooktop and 36"" counter depth refrigerator.

The microwave is over the range with a vent as we want to use appliances like water kettle etc. underneath and that would clear the steam. 

The dishwasher will be integrated next to the sink. 

We do not drink coffee at all, so no dedicated coffee area needed. The distance between the island and the countertops around is about 1,20m.

Do you see any major flaws? Anything that is a nogo?

1k4pa6x,https://i.redd.it/xrmwxvfya9we1.png,"[UPDATE] Bad Roommate threw a 5 AM Rager on a Monday, and I signed a new lease 3 days later.","Hey everyone! This is a follow-up to my original post about my roommate (Roommate 1 / “Bad Roommate”) who neglected her cat, disrespected shared spaces, and clashed with me any time I tried to set a boundary or compromise. 

About 5 days after I texted her asking if we could grab coffee and talk things out (no response), it’s her birthday. I expected some noise, sure—it’s her house too. She had people over the night before, so I figured that was it. **NOPE.** 

Monday night, I’m asleep by 11 because I have in-office work on Tuesdays. At 2:30 AM, I wake up to a huge group of people coming in. Music starts blasting. It’s a full-blown afterparty in our living room—on a Monday. 

The house is over 100 years old and the walls are paper thin. I text Good Roommate (Roommate 2), but she doesn’t reply because she left her phone upstairs to check things out. Bad Roommate even directs drunk strangers to use Good Roommate and I's shared bathroom (which backs against my bedroom wall), so now I’m hearing people slamming the door, laughing, and stumbling all night. (Would like to mention Bad Roommate has her own private bathroom upstairs on our 3rd floor that is perfectly usable)

By 5:30 AM, I’ve gotten **zero** sleep. I peek out my window and—of course—some random dude is puking in our courtyard. Suddenly, I hear loud bangs, thuds, and yelling from the kitchen. I text Good Roommate again and find out a **f**ight broke out between random bar guys and Bad Roommate’s boyfriend’s friends. Just straight-up bar fight in my kitchen. I tell Good Roommate someone threw up outside. Good Roommate (bless her) casually asks Bad Roommate if anyone puked. Bad Roommate, instead of helping, asks the drunk guys *if they puked* (lol). They say no (duh), so she accuses **me** of being *paranoid and eavesdropping*.

Bad Roommate then goes to bed, leaving Good Roommate to kick out these drunk strangers until 7:30 AM.

Later that day — after crashing at work and faking a reason to go home early — I finally get a response to my message from *5 days prior* where I had asked to talk and ""apologize"".

Here’s what she sent me:



>“You can and should apologize though and without therapy terms if possible, I’m listening. Also, I’m having people over Friday and would appreciate if you could get lost then ❤️”



See attached screenshot \[pic below\].

  
That was it. I’m done. Three days later, I signed a lease for my own one-bedroom. I move in Saturday. I have no idea why she insisted both Good Roommate & I not sign the lease for this current space, but I am so thankful for her stupidity. She doesn’t know yet, Good Roommate told me privately that she's skipping out early in June.

  
I’m out. I’m free. Reap what you sow.  And no longer living with someone who thinks “get lost” is a cute way to communicate.

1k4p6f7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tarotpractices/comments/1k4p6f7/tarot_resources_for_beginners_say_no_to_ai/,Tarot Resources for Beginners (say NO to AI!),"Hello all! Many of you may have seen the recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tarotpractices/comments/1k3tq2b/stop_using_chatgpt_for_your_readings/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) encouraging people, especially those new to tarot, not to use ChatGPT or other AI to help interpret readings (which I fully agree with). I saw some comments from beginners requesting other sources to help with readings, & thought it would be nice to start a ***thread of resources for beginners*** to use ***instead of AI.***

I am by no means an expert; I started exactly where you are! Through some Google searching (& mostly Reddit scrolling), these are the resources I found that have worked for me so far. I just want to encourage you all that there are some really great, easy-to-use & understand resources out there. Please feel free to contribute to this thread! I'm still learning myself & always love more sources. 

NOTE: The purpose of this thread is ***NOT*** **TO DEBATE THE USE OF AI.** 

**It's purpose is to provide RESOURCES TO BEGINNERS.** 

**Please limit posts to** ***RECOMMENDATIONS*** **or** ***REQUESTS*** **for books, websites, blogs, etc. to keep this thread as organized as possible.**  <3

\----------

**ON MY SHELF:** 

*Interpretation ""Dictionaries""*

My absolute favorite book is called ""**A Little Bit of Tarot**"" by *Cassandra Eason*. I would consider this a modern must-have, the interpretations are really thorough & provide explanations from a variety of perspectives. Very well organized, it's like a little tarot dictionary. The interpretations often feel so personal, I use this for every reading (as I'm still a beginner myself)!! This is genuinely my go-to resource, I often don't feel the need to consult other sources aside to confirm what this book says is true. 

Another handy little book is just “**Tarot**"" by *David V Barrett*. It's a small book densely packed with great info! Has lots of essential info about the history/origins of tarot, explains the different deck types & their imagery, etc. Also has interpretational meanings for all cards, although they are very basic adjectives. A good coffee table book to have on hand/easy to throw in your bag for quick readings. An incredibly handy and quick resource, that also gives you important history.  

*Learning The Cards*

If you're an interactive learner, I highly recommend ""**The Psychic Pathway: A Workbook for Reawakening the Voice of Your Soul**"" by *Sonia Choquette*. It’s a physical workbook that guides you through different readings/exercises with the cards. A great way for beginners to get to know the deck & it’s fun!!

*Reversals*

I just got a copy of ""**The Complete Book of Tarot Reversals**"" by *Evelin Bürger et. al* that I haven’t had a chance to use yet but have heard good things about. The other books I’ve mentioned so far tend not to have reversal meanings. I believe I saw this book recommended somewhere on Reddit. 

*Spreads*

The ""**Complete Book of Tarot Spreads**"" by *Evelin Bürger et. al* is a comprehensive resource for different spreads. I don't find myself using it very often personally, but this is only bc I tend to prefer ""messy"" or disorganized spreads (see more on that below). That may change as I keep learning, so I'm glad to have it. It's a great resource if you are interested in more structured spreads! I believe this book dives into some astrology associations as well but I might be mistaken. 

\-----

**My 2-cents** (this is literally just like... what I've been doing !)

*Personal* advice to beginners 

* If you want to start with spreads you can, but they can be also overwhelming (they were for me)
* Tarot is about intuition & spirit guidance. As a beginner I feel I ended up restricting myself trying to follow ""rules"" instead of just playing with the cards. 
* Get at least one book for interpretations. Yes you can use your phone to Google things, but I feel like it breaks me out of the spell. Having a book onhand is always helpful. 
* Have a notebook dedicated for your readings. This is especially helpful for familiarizing yourself with the cards. 

**My favorite way to read:** 

* I most frequently do what I'd call a messy spread or a chaos spread. 
* Pick a topic & set my intentions. Shuffle my cards with intentions in mind. 
   * I do a few classic card shuffles, cut the deck at random a few times (as many as feel right), then usually shuffle in a big pile 
* I pull cards at random, but more often they **jump** or **spit** **out** at me with all the pile-shuffling
* I pull (or *let the deck spit out*) as many cards as feels right. Sometimes I know I'm done, sometimes it feels like there's another card in there for me. 
* Sometimes I lay the cards in shapes or positions, sometimes I line them up, I really couldn't tell you why I do one or the other. 
* I write down the **shape/position** of my cards, the card itself + its direction, as well as my intentions when shuffling. 
* Go through my books; write down the meanings of each card & how/whether it applies (this is why a notebook is particularly important)
* This isn't necessarily *the* way to do things! This is just what has worked best for me to familiarize myself with the cards without getting overwhelmed

If you got this far, thank you for reading! I really hope this is helpful. Again, please feel free to contribute your own sources, give any advice, etc. I certainly don't know everything, just wanted to provide a place for people to start.

The show airs on Thursday and we have to wait an entire week to express our frustrations just in time to get upset all over again when the new episode airs. 😂 Wouldn’t it make more sense to have our day of wailing be halfway between the previous air date and the new one? Like we get two days to sit with our feelings. We purge them on either Sunday or Monday. Then we spend the next few days in a better headspace in preparation for Thursday. I only ask because I feel a tension in this community since last Thursday’s episode. We’re all walking on eggshells because we’re trying to follow the rules of the community by keeping negativity at bay.

1k4p190,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1k4p190/coteachinginteractions_with_families/,Coteaching-interactions with families,"I have to share this because it’s quite upsetting and I’m wondering if there are any teachers who have had similar experiences.

I’m a special education teacher teaching in an ICT classroom in elementary school. There have been a couple families that have done this but one particularly that has done this multiple times where they are gifting my coteacher things and not acknowledging me. I don’t know how to phrase this without possibly sounding selfish but it’s not the material things that I care about. It’s the acknowledgement that my coteacher receives but I have not. When there is an issue with the student and other students both of us are involved in contacting families and solving whatever the issue is. When this specific family emails us about something we are both addressed in the email and there is no distinction in who is the Gen Ed and who is the sped teacher. However, this family has sent little gifts/treats with notes multiple times to my coteacher. Today, this parent was talking to my coteacher on the phone. She had sent another gift in and when my co was thanking her for the gift on the phone, the parent said she wanted to give my co some coffee but she didn’t know how she took it. My co told her what she liked and the mom said she’d send in some coffee. I was not mentioned.

Again, this isn’t about being gifted anything so I’m not trying to sound selfish. But teaching is a very difficult job so when a parent goes out of their way to say thank you, it’s always appreciated. That’s why it’s so hard for me in this situation. Just wondering if other teachers out there have experienced something similar and how they dealt with it.

Also, discussing this with my co would not help. We are not a good match and have different working styles. We have had multiple discussions about this and both have accepted we are not a good fit. She likes to be in control and I have often been treated like an assistant. Being that she is closely related to admin doesn’t help so I have to tread carefully when having discussions with her about specific concerns. However, both of us stay professional for the students and their families. We are just both trying to ride it out until the end of the year.  ",3,1745270493.0,Teachers,1,1.0,False

After about 2.5-3 months, the water pump started working poorly. When I opened up the coffee machine, I found a pretty standard water pump (like the ones used for aquariums) and found the exact same pump online for $5.

It recently arrived and I replaced it (all I had to do was unsolder and solder 2 power wires). It started pumping water perfectly. I decided to also clean it from limescale and ran a cleaning cycle.

And that's when I realized it stopped heating the water. Completely. The water was the same temperature as in the water tank.

I tried searching Google for my problem, but everyone was saying something like ""check the fuse on the heater and push it with a paperclip.""

I did push it! I have a multimeter at home and I checked - there's continuity when testing this fuse. I also checked the circuit - it's intact.

I understand I probably should have just returned it right away, but this is more like a challenge now. I want to figure it out.

1k4oz6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k4oz6l/why_should_you_choose_the_bodum_brazil_french/,Why Should You Choose the Bodum Brazil French Press Review for Coffee Lovers?,"Testing coffee gear is something I genuinely enjoy doing daily. The **Bodum 1548-01US Brazil French Press Coffee Maker** is no exception. This French press is among the latest products I’ve tried, and although it has plenty to offer, there are a few things worth pointing out.  

**Design & Build Quality**  
This French press comes with a clean, minimalist design typical of Bodum, and I love how the black color blends with the kitchen aesthetic. Its carafe is made from borosilicate glass, which is both heat-resistant and odorless. Honestly, I’ve grown tired of poorly-made glasswares that end up taking on unwanted smells, but the build here is top-notch. The BPA-free plastic handle and base are lightweight yet durable, offering a surprisingly sturdy grip. During my daily coffee-making ritual, these small details made the entire process feel effortless. The stainless steel plunger and mesh filter also deserve a nod for their precision, as they don’t allow a single coffee ground to escape. As someone who cherishes a clean, grit-free cup of coffee, this feature is a lifesaver.  

**Ease of Use**  
Operating this manual coffee maker is as straightforward as coffee preparation gets. Pour in hot water (around 92-96°C; Bodum is very specific about this) over your coffee grinds, leave some room at the top, and let it steep. I find that stirring with a wooden spoon, as recommended, produces even extraction. After four minutes, all it takes is a gentle press of the plunger, and your coffee is ready. I mean, anyone – even my teenager – could figure it out. Cleanup is equally simple thanks to its dishwasher-safe components, and that’s a blessing when you just want to enjoy your brew with minimal post-work.  

**Check [Bodum 1548-01US Brazil French Press Coffee Maker](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b000kem4tq/) price on Amazon.**  

**Advantages**  
This product gets a lot of things right, especially if simplicity and efficiency are your priorities.  
- The borosilicate glass ensures the coffee tastes as intended without unwanted flavors.  
- No need for wasteful paper filters or single-use capsules, making this a greener option.  
- Compact and lightweight, it’s an ideal fit for smaller kitchens or even for taking on camping trips.  

**Negatives**  
As much as I loved the experience, there are a couple of things that stood out as slight flaws:  
- The BPA-free plastic base, while strong, feels a little cheap compared to fully stainless options.  
- Coffee tends to cool faster than expected, although pre-heating the glass carafe alleviates this issue somewhat.  

**Performance & Coffee Quality**  
What’s a French press worth if it can’t consistently provide a robust, flavorful cup of coffee? I found this model shines here. By steeping the coffee grounds effectively, it extracts the kind of bold aromas and nuanced flavors that I seek. In fact, using fresh beans from my local roaster, the richness of the brew blew me away. However, precise measurement and timing are necessary to avoid over-extraction, which was evident after one lazy attempt where I left the press unattended for too long.  

**Competing Brands**  
The French press market has no shortage of options. Compared to similar coffee makers like the Aeropress or Frieling stainless steel models, this one stands out for its affordability and minimalism. While the Aeropress may score higher for portability and the Frieling for insulation, neither offers the same pleasing coffee taste without paper filters like the Bodum. On the downside, Frieling’s stainless steel body feels more premium, functioning better for heat retention.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Value-wise, this coffee maker ticks most of the boxes. It provides high-quality coffee results, requires minimal upkeep, and aligns with sustainable practices. Considering the ability to brew effortlessly without additional costs for filters, its pricing feels justified. While I’ve come across other models in the same range, few match its balance of simplicity and quality, making it a sound investment.

1k4owih,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4owih,Our week in Kauai,"We had a lovely trip to Kauai. We stayed in Princeville and loved Hanalei for the food, shopping and beach. 

We took the Ha’ena shuttle to the state park and hiked the 4 mile (round trip) trail to Hanakapi’ai beach. That was probably a highlight for me. The shuttle has 3-4 stops it can make on your way out- including a Na Pali art gallery, coffee shop, garden and the town of Hanalei. I wish I’d known this as we would have brought a change of clothes for after the hike so we could take advantage of the shuttle stops. We were just so muddy afterward that we didn’t have it in us to do that. The shuttle driver was full of great tips though!

We took a Captain Andy’s BBQ Catamaran tour of the Na Pali coast. The captain said it was the best weather they’d had in awhile. It was perfect. The snorkeling was excellent. And the food was great too (burger/veggie burger, coleslaw, baked beans, open bar).

We explored Waimea Canyon- mostly driving as the kids didn’t really want to hike. And we got hungry. It was beautiful. We did it back to back days with the Captain Andy’s boat tour and probably should have thought that through better because it was a LOT of driving for 2 days in a row (coming from Princeville).

We did the Smith Family Garden and Luau and thought it was great. The gardens were amazing and the food was excellent. The show was great too!

For beaches we went to:

Anini: mostly just waded with the kids.

Hanalei Bay: great for kids- amazing backdrop with the mountains. Plenty of parking. 

Ha’ena and Tunnels: amazing snorkeling and soft sand and great wading and swimming areas. This was by far our favorite. Parking was tough so might want to get there early.

Lydgate: my son loved the salt water pool and playground 

Poipu: turtles and monk seals were great. Good swimming/wading. It was pretty crowded during the day but cleared up by evening. 

Ke’e: was kinda rough for more than just wading. 

We aren’t very big foodies so we mostly ate bagels at our lodging and packed lunches but we did like the shaved ice at Sunrise Shave Ice in Princeville better than JoJo’s. And Lappert’s Hawaii had great ice cream. And Kōloa Pizza Kitchen had great pizza in a cute town to check out. Oh and Jammin Banana in Lihue has amazing cold brew coffee!

In general, her store manager seems to be a real POS who doesn't know the job, he just got hired after being a salesman somewhere else. To make a long story short, his employees and superiors hate him, but he makes a point of studying the rules to find ways in which he can use loopholes to do whatever he wants and be as lazy as possible.

One of the worst things he does is refuse to acknowledge any time off requests until the AI makes a schedule for him. The worst instance I know of is that last year, an older employee requested time off around Christmas in JULY of that year so she could spend time with her visiting grandchildren, and he waited until 3 weeks out to deny it. There's a trip I would like to make in June, but he's saying he'll address her time off request closer to that time. Not only does that make creating travel plans impossible, but it also isn't something I can wait for due to the nature of MY job. Yet when asked to give an answer, whether yes or no, he still refuses to say anything prior to 3 weeks out.

My wife and I left the church several years ago, and late last year we left the morridor for Southern CA. When we left, we had some close friends that had left right around the same time (our ministering couple, in fact!) that we spent a lot of time with, discovering the world that always existed that we were forbidden to explore.

I am highly dyslexic so I'm so sorry if this is hard to reed! 

IMPORTANT CONTEXT: 
My material Grandmother (F72) let's call her Daisy and Grandfather (NOW dececed) were married for 19 years before separating in 1988. 

Me (F24) and my sister (F18) grew up with my grandmother coming round every day, she would take us to the park, help with homework, and help our mum with housework. The point is for the first 16 years of my life I can't remember a day without her there. 

After I turn 16 my Grandfather passed away he was the prime male figure I'm my life due to my dad being somewhat absent, and the person I looked up too. It wasn't sudden we knew it was coming (cancers a b***h), and the day my mum came home and told us he had passed away we cried for what seemed like hours. 

My mum's partner at the time decided to give my Grandmother a call to let her know (although they has been split for 19 odd years).

A few days later my mum reached out to Daisy to ask for help planning the funeral. (She hadn't been round to see us once) she had no response... a few days go by and my mum goes to see her. Daisy explains she is grieving and she needs time... Time goes by and the next time we see her is the funeral... she doesn't say a word to my Mum, my Aunt, me, or my 11year old sister. 

As you could imagine we are all Quite Hurt by this. My Grandfather died in September 2017. There were several attempts to contact Daisy over the years but no response, and then all of a sudden I get a message from her in OCTOBER OF 2023! 

She explains that she LOST HER PHONE AND HAD ONLY JUST RECENTLY FOUND IT! Baring in mind that we literally lived 5 minutes away from her. Someone had sent Daisy a message and told her that I had gotten engaged. Despite all the alarm bells ringing in my head, I agreed to meet up for coffee to have a chat with her. I walked into the coffee shop and waited, and waited, and waited until, she shows up 30 minutes late she sits down and before I say anything she shows me her engagement ring ! It turns out after I got engaged her new toy boy decided to pop the question too he's about 45 ! 

All she did while having a chat was talk sh*t about my mum and aunty and her sister ect ect and it all seemed so toxic.

In the time Daisy was out of contact with us, my mum had lost her wife to cancer. So when my grandmother said ""oh I wished your mum would have reached out to invite me to the wedding it was very cruel of her to disregard my feelings like that"", and ""I had eye surgery you know, your mum should have been there for me""  (the eye surgery had a recovery period of 1 week and was exactly 3 days after my mum lost her partner).I WAS SO UPSET TO HERE HER SAY THINGS LIKE THIS 

After all those red flags I agreed to meet with her again. This time she apologized about what she had said to me, but as the time went on something turned sour in her. She kept asking me questions about MY wedding where? when? what time? ect ect . And finally ""when am I getting my invite"" at that point I had enough! I told her ""at this rate you won't be coming"" we had a full blown argument infront of everyone. 

I brushed past her and she started saying I had hit her and that she was an old lady and crying I had never ever seen this side of her in my life. . I left and I called my fiance crying. It turns out after I left she had asked the owners of the cafe to call the police but thankfully the owner was a regular at the pub I work at and he said he had cameras and witnessed nothing of the kind. 

Here is the bit that worries me. Someone told Daisy when and where the wedding is and it's too late to change anything she's said she is going to come to the ceremony and because we are getting married in a church there is no way I can stop her! What do I do if she turns up? I need help!

1k4oq80,https://www.reddit.com/r/aromantic/comments/1k4oq80/how_i_figured_out_im_aromantic/,How i figured out i'm aromantic...,"...hopefully.

This will be just a mix of long rant and SLOW realisations. Many stories on this sub are somehow relatable, so i decided to share mine, for people who might be in the same boat. I feel a bit lonely about this whole thing and i'm not sure how to bring it up with friends lol.

I figured out i'm lesbian pretty early (around 12-13) and haven't had any doubts about my sexuality. I was happy i knew so early compared to many people who learn later. Well, now that i'm almost 20 i have another sexuality crisis yay!

Looking back at all my ""crushes""/relationship-y situations i don't think they were romantic at all. My first ""crush"" was my then best friend, we were classmates, hung out often, texted every day, she was the first friend i told i'm lesbian. When a boy fell in love with her, we all hang out, but she wasn't into it, so we literally ran away xd. These romantic feelings others had as kids were really confusing, so i thought my obsession was actually romantic. I didn't tell her, cause i valued our friendship more. She was my best friend and an obsession/hyperfixation, i wanted to know everything about her. Even then i was constantly jumping between platonic or romantic love, cause i didn't know the difference. It just faded away. 

Well, i changed schools, tons of new people. And there was this one classmate who i thought looked extremely cool, let's call her ""A"". I wanted to be friends with her so bad since the first time i saw her. I was extremely shy, but she approached me after some months, we talked a lot, became best friends instantly. But i didn't mistake my feelings for romantic this time, she was my favorite person, best friend. She introduced me to her other friend, let's call him ""B"", cause she thought we had a lot in common. She was right. I became extremely obsessed with both of them, i couldn't stop thinking about them. The three of us became inseperable. This was the first time in my life i actually had a friendgroup i felt welcomed in. At least i thought... Suddenly, ""A"" and ""B"" had a big fight. ""A"" ignored me completely, didn't answer my texts. After some time of being confused and sad, ""B"" texted me he had something important to tell me. Apparently, they were dating the whole time and broke up. They were keeping it a secret at the start, but thought i knew in the end. How was i supposed to know? I think i'm stupid. Other people in my life even asked if they were dating, but i said no, cause they said they were friends. I was the only blind person. I can't see romantic feelings even in other people😭. I stayed friends with ""B"" and we are close till this day. Even ""A"" is okay, we're not friends anymore, but are on good terms now.

On completely different note, i have an amazing online friend. After a year of knowing each other, she confessed her romantic crush for me. I said that i love her too. It was a lie. I figured that romantic feelings are just strong platonic feelings with the sexual stuff. After 2 weeks i felt discusted with myself, i felt like she loved me differently than i love her. The romantic couple reels she sent weirded me out. Why can't we act like friends, nothing changes in a relationship, right? So i broke up with her, telling her i loved her as a friend, not a romantic partner. We're still good friends tho.

You'd think i would learn from my mistake, but i tried talking to people online again. One girl confessed her crush on me while she was drunk and then she ghosted me. Once again i was just confused. 

And lastly, i became online friends with another girl. We actually met, spent the whole day together, went for a lunch, coffee, walked around the town... Something felt off, she was kind and sweet, but after few days i finally came to the conclusion that it felt like a date. And that made me uncomfortable. We stopped talking.

I had a big existencial and identity crises over the last summer. I went over all my relationships and was sure i'm on aromantic spectrum. Eventually, i just stopped thinking about it until 2 weeks ago. My close friend (with whom i'm obsessed, in a way she's my favorite person. My other friends are convinced i have/had a crush on her, which is not true) suddenly said, she thinks she might be aromantic and we had a long discussion about it. I've never felt so understood! It was mostly her talking and me listening, but i actually was so happy not to be alone with this. She's bi and aromantic, i knew about the bi part. We talked about future and how we'd imagine it, the struggles of accepting being aro but not ace, that she'd see having a fwb as the best scenario and i agreed, followed by weird silence xd. It made us closer (i think and hope), nothing else changed, we still send each other memes, she sometimes jokingly flirts, we talk, study together, i couldn't wish for a better friend.

And now i'm here, reading about aro identities again, this time more seriously. So if you read this far, thank you guys for your stories; they helped me realise who i am. And for anyone wondering, hope this helps!",1,1745269733.0,aromantic,1,1.0,False

1k4omus,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1k4omus/help_me_make_a_better_cup/,Help me make a better cup,"I enjoy my hand brews but gf wanted a machine so we got the Aiden. No complaints really! Just trying to fine-tune my recipe. I am basically only buying the wush wush from steady state for the Aiden just to keep my life simple. The cup is not BAD but it's a bit strong? I  don't think that's the word I'm looking for cause I  like it strong but it's too much of something. I'm wondering how to get a maybe lighter cup?? Also I should say, I have a 1zpresso zp6 but again just to make our lives easy I've basically only been using my fellow opus for the Aiden.  For batch brews (600-900ml) I've been grinding it at 7.8 instead of 7.3 as suggested below. What should I do differently ??

Here is the recipe that the chat gpt thing gave me.

Here’s a custom Fellow Aiden profile for Kerchache Wush Wush from Steady State. This is a natural-processed Ethiopian Wush Wush varietal from Yirgacheffe with 120hr fermentation and grown at 1900m elevation – a complex, high-altitude coffee likely to present juicy, fruit-forward notes with floral aromatics.

This recipe leans into the clarity and complexity of the Wush Wush varietal with high temp, staged pulses that encourage juicy, bright extractions while controlling over-fermented notes. The bloom is generous to ensure full degassing, especially critical with extended fermentation naturals.

1k4oiux,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProjectSekai/comments/1k4oiux/the_movie_was_great_but/,"The Movie was Great, But…","I deleted and am rewritting my original post because I sounded biased, and I started getting hate on it.

I do not think some characters in the Proseka Movie were as well executed as others. I also feel they focused too much on side characters rather than the main characters in certain parts, like that kid in the beanie. 

I feel a majority of the movie was focused on Ichika, Minori, Kohane, Tsukasa, Kanade, the Virtual Singers, Saki, Toya, Emu, and Mafuyu. There is nothing wrong with the first 6 I mentioned, they are all a part of the main cast, especially Miku because the movie is literally about her, however, I find it odd that they decided to focus more on 4 singular group members, rather than the entire group. I understand the movie can’t go on forever, but you’d think they’d try and give an equal amount of screen time to each group member. 

I’d like to share my thoughts on characters I felt were left out, OOC, and/or treated oddly/differently/strangely, and before anyone says anything, I’d like to state right now, that the movie was good, I adored it, but I still have critiques. You can like a film, but still have negative feelings about some parts. If you’re fine with that, then continue on.



Honami- Honami is extremely important in the game because not only is she the drummer in Leo/Need, she’s also Kanade’s caretaker. Yes, they don’t explain this in the movie, which is perfectly reasonable, because the movie is assuming you already know about the different character traits each character has, and a movie can only go on for so long. However, she felt more like a brushed off side character rather than an actual member of Leo/Need. I remember her speaking about six times. She probably spoke more than that, but I really don’t remember her speaking all that much compared to Shiho, Saki and Ichika. Again, I understand it’s a movie, they can only fit so much into it, it’s not like the game that’s been running for 3 to 4 years, but I really don’t like that they kinda brushed her off, and didn’t give her as good of a role as she deserved in the movie.

Shiho- Shiho felt very out of character for me. The Shiho I know in the game can be aggressive at times but means well by it. In the movie she felt more like…I don’t know, pacifist…? It felt like her aggressive personality trait, one of her key traits, was pretty much gone. There were a few times it was shown, but not as much as her other traits. Her character felt very cookie-cutter, and wrong to me. They kept her kind and compassionate character traits, but the way they hardly added her aggressive traits into the movie bothers me.

Haruka- I liked how she helped Minori take a break when she needed it. And I liked how we saw a shot of her room with her showing all the penguins. However, I feel like that’s all Haruka really did, at least from my perspective. It felt like her most important scene was her telling Minori that she needs to take a break to be at 100%. It just felt weird to me because her personality is so much more fleshed out than just being a good friend to Minori and the others, and her love of penguins. But this is really the only vibe I got from her in the movie other than her wanting to help others with the rest of More More Jump.

Airi- I like how they showed Airi’s relationship with every More More Jump member. That was done perfectly, but that’s all she really did. She was used for an, in my opinion, unnecessary scene with Mizuki and Shizuku at the start when they were buying clothes. It just fell off to me. She did redeem herself near the end, when she did get a few more scenes, but before that, it felt like she was just there because she’s in the group. 

Shizuku- I feel like Shizuku pretty much did nothing for a majority of the movie until after everyone decided to write a song for Miku, like it felt more like she was just there because she’s in the group just like Airi. We saw how much she thinks about her sister in the beginning, which is nice. I liked that. But after that, she hardly did anything until the final act. 

An- An felt very underutilized in the movie. Kohane and Toya shared the spotlight more than her and Akito, and it bothered me. There was nothing really wrong with her, I just feel like she could have done more than what she did. 

Akito- Akito’s character in the movie just felt weird at first. We saw him and Ena at the beginning of the movie, Ena said she was going out, and Akito said he was too. Ena asks him about the coffee shop, and that’s really it. That’s the only time we see Akito and Ena interact and see their sibling dynamic compared to Saki and Tsukasa, and Shiho and Shizuku at the beginning of the movie and start of the third act. However, after Toya shows him Miku, his character goes back to it’s normal in-game personality, and I don’t have any problems with it. 

Tsukasa- They did him kinda dirty in the movie. His dream is to be a star and bring a smile to people’s, specifically his sister's, face. You’d think they’d want to show that in the movie, but he just yelled all the time, even during a few serious moments, he was yelling. It felt like that was Tsukasa’s entire personality other than his love of acting and singing. Guys, Tsukasa’s personality is not just being loud, and he knows how to keep his voice down for serious situations. Yes, a majority of the time, he is very loud, but not as much as he was in the movie. I get it, it was for comedic effect, but it gets to a point where it’s too much. Another thing I didn’t like, and you can disagree if you want, he didn’t feel like the troupe leader. I'll elaborate in Emu’s part, but it didn’t feel right. Why wouldn’t the writers give Tsukasa the main role in the show that WxS was talking about in the beginning of the movie for people who haven’t played the game? Yes, he does not always have the main role, and that’s perfectly fine, it’d be boring if it was just him getting the lead, but if I had never played the game before, and I saw the movie, I would have never guessed he would be the troupe leader. I’d think Emu would be. 

Emu- Emu felt more like the troupe leader than Tsukasa in the movie, she had the main role in the show WxS were planning at the start if the movie, she got the main singing part in Smile Symphony, and she was the first one in WxS to see Miku. I will cut her some slack there because Mafuyu was the first in N25 to see Miku, and Miku was at the girls' school, I can’t argue against that. I’ll also cut her some slack for Smile Symphony because the main part did fit her character the best, but I think Tsukasa having the main part in WxS’s song would make more sense to new players or people who play the game. It would show them just how devoted Tsukasa is to his goal, and show them that he is the troupe leader. 

Nene- They took away a lot of Nene’s shy characteristics, and only showed her sassy side. I also think she was given the least amount of screen time out of everyone in WxS, which is a shame because she’s such an interesting character. I can’t really elaborate any more about her in the movie because of how little screen time she was given. However, I think she had the best vocals in Smile Symphony. 

Rui- If you saw my original post, you know about the problem I had with Rui in the movie, one thing almost everyone can agree about Rui is his “Mad Scientist” trait is what makes him such a good director. The game takes full advantage of it, and most, if not all of his conversations at school are about his inventions and him blowing up parts of the school. He and Tsukasa do it so much, the other students call them the Weirdo Wombo Combo, at the Wonder Stage, or in the WonderShow Sekai, Rui almost always gets a crazy look on his face when talking about his ideas, but in the movie that never happened, which was disappointing to me. He acted chill, it wasn’t a bad thing, it just felt weird to me. As someone on my other post said, “he was less ‘mad’ and more ‘scientist’”. After thinking it over, I realize it’s not the worst thing in the world, and I over reacted because I was expecting more. But that’s my fault for having such high expectations for a single character in a movie based off of a game with over 20 characters. 

Ena- It’s the same with Akito, We saw her and Akito at the beginning of the movie, Ena said she was going out, and Akito said he was too. Ena asks him about the coffee shop, and that’s really it. After that, her character is completely fine, it’s just that one scene in the beginning that felt weird. 

Mizuki- There was nothing really wrong with Mizuki aside from that weird shopping scene in the beginning, but even then, it showed her love for fashion, which is a key element of her personality, but they never really elaborated on it. I honestly just think she deserved more screen time. 


Everyone on this subreddit is talking about how much they loved the movie, I did too, but there were many flaws I don’t think people are pointing out that I feel need be addressed. Please politely correct me if I missed anything or said anything incorrect. I’d like to be as accurate as possible.

The Home Helper Parts 53 and 54 by Davina Burridge

Willa is about to learn what it is like being in a room with women who do not consider him to be a man. 

The hairdresser, Lizabeth, is a woman who constantly moves, forever excited. She has come armed with intimidating boxes that she sets up on the table. 

Avery has brought a full-length mirror into the kitchen, and balanced it against the wall facing an upright wooden chair.

As a nervous Willa settles into the chair, he sees his full length image, in its delightful rose pink maid’s uniform, with the belled collar, apron and heels.

It is a sexually stirring sight, which makes him gasp out loud. It is, after all, weeks since he has come normally, so he is constantly in a state of arousal. His only relief coming from being permitted to use his Master’s vibrator. 

Avery opens a bottle of chilled white wine, proudly explaining to the hairdresser, “Usually, my maid does this. But this is a special occasion. I get so few girly chats these days.”

Rolling her eyes, Lizabeth says, “Tell me about it. Talking to men is like talking to a brick wall. I mean, they just don’t listen!”

Avery and Lizabeth speak at a hell of a speed, and it takes a while for Willa to be able to tune in.

“I’ve a few pictures of a shaggy bob.” Lizabeth shows Avery her smart phone and starts swiping. 

Willa’s wife pays wide eyed attention. 

Lisabeth says, “I thought this one. It’ll bring out your maid’s cheek bones. Soften her features.”

Willa tries to peer at the images but doesn’t want to be naughty and rise from his seat.

Once the style is selected, Lizabeth works at lightning speed, swiftly adding painful extensions which make Willa squeal. It is like having your hair constantly pulled by a bully.

“Oh babe,” Avery smiles at his discomfort. “You’re about to find out what we girls go through for beauty!”

Lizabeth laughs, “Oh, Willa, you’ll love it. Guys won’t be able to take their eyes off you.”

Avery says, “She’s already got one dog chasing her tail. Maid, tell Lizabeth about him, honey.”

Will flushes hot red, “Mistress, please. I can’t …”

“Nonsense! Silly! We girls talk about everything,” Avery says.

As another extension is put in, Lizabeth says, “Oh guys go apeshit for cute girls in maid’s uniforms. I bet your admirer can’t keep his paws off you.”

“And something else out of her,” Avery laughs.

Willa swallows at the shame of his own wife betraying him to a stranger.

“Mistress, please!”

Lizabeth says, “Oh, don’t worry. We all get it. In fact, girls who don’t get male attention hate it. I bet he had his way with you and then discarded you!”

Willa gasps, “That’s right! He didn’t say anything afterwards. But he was nice later.”

The hairdresser grows serious. “Tell me about it! They get what they want and then scarper. Only to come sniffing back when they want more.”

Avery says, “I mean, what are they like. Overgrown kids, who’ve got to have their own way.”

Lizabeth grins, “Oh, I like that bit. Let them do that!”

Avery says, “My man is all over me all the time, isn’t he Willa? I mean he only takes about ten minutes to recharge and he’s off again.”

Lizabeth says, “Oh god. Those guys are amazing. A real keeper.”

Avery becomes thoughtful. “He’s kinda getting serious.”

Lisabeth stops. “Wedding bells?”

Willa’s eyes widen with shock.

“Oh, I don’t know about that. But he loves the kids. I think he likes the idea of a home. He’s here all the time.”

Lisabeth laughs. “Of course he is. He has you and the children, a house to come to for dinner and lunch. And a cute obedient maid. I bet he feels like he is a king when he’s here!”

Folding her arms, Avery sighs. “He is just so protective. We all feel so safe when he is around, don’t we Willa?”

Willa nods reluctantly and pouts. “I suppose so. He has these rules, and we all know where we stand.”

Lizabeth fluffs out his hair, “That’s the best thing about guys. I hate men who are ineffectual. Now, Avery, how would you like it if we lighten Willa’s hair a few more shades of blonde? I was thinking, ash blonde or maybe strawberry blonde, you know? But I think honey blonde will be so pretty on her.”

Avery whispers naughtily, “Mr Jackson Hunter will be creaming himself in those sexy tight jeans of his when he sees you!”

“Wow,” Lizabeth giggles. “Jackson Hunter. What a name. I have to change my knickers just thinking about a man with that name.”

Avery giggles, and Willa joins her, feeling less embarrassed and more proud that he has a guy fancying him whose name makes other girls envious.

“That’s if Willa’s Master allows him to meet up with Jackson.”

“Oh, I know,” Lizabeth moans. “The dominant ones like your Marvin are like having another Daddy.” She mimics a deep male voice, “You can’t do this, you can’t do that!”

Laughing, Avery adds, “And he’ll probably have to have Willa home by ten! And tell her what she can and cannot wear.”

Lizabeth whispers into Willa’s ear. “Gosh, your own daddy. An overprotective daddy! Smacked bottom and early to bed if you are naughty.”

Willa’s mouth gapes open. “How did you know about that?”

Placing her hands gently on his shoulders, feeling the straps from his corset through his delicate maid’s dress, the hairdresser says, “I didn’t. Silly! But I do now!”

Willa feels himself slump in his chair, trying to become invisible.

Avery is chortling at her maid’s mortification. “Your Master is right. You are so dumb!” She leans down to kiss his cheek again, “But so adorable.”

Lizabeth squats next to him, “Don’t worry. All guys think we’re dumb.” She stands and laughs. “And I think they have a point. I mean, look at the way we put up with them.”

Feeling better, Willa laughs with his Mistress and hairdresser at men being men.

For the next hour, the three girls engage in incessant gossip about men, their faults and what men do that turns them on. With Willa joining in, initially with embarrassment, but soon realising that girls don’t have a piss taking hierarchy, it is all right to be silly and expose yourself.

Until, that is, Willa’s hair with the gorgeous shaggy bob rolling around his softened features, is fluffily complete. The light plays off the bright honey blonde colour. 

Willa so much needs to cum when he sees himself in the reflection and loves it when the two women coo over his appearance.

Willa’s smile collapses when Lizabeth picks up her smartphone and says, “Now lips are a personal taste. I mean I don’t like it too much when a girl has those crazy Hollywood injections. I think subtle full lips, top and bottom will do it. The whore balloon lips look so horrible and vulgar.”

“Mistress,” Willa squeaks, “I wonder if …”

“Hush maid,” Avery says, her eyes fixed on the images until a wicked smile plays on her lips. “Unless of course you want the whore balloon lips!”

Lizabeth giggles, “Aw. Don’t give her the trout pout!” And then laughs. “Perhaps we should ask Mr Jackson Hunter what he’d like around his cock.”

The two women laugh loudly, until Avery sees the terror stricken expression on her maid’s face.

She kisses his cheek. 

“Aw, Honey, I don’t want a maid of mine looking like a cock sucking whore. Really. You’ll look great.”

Crouching down next to the anxious maid, Lizabeth says, “Don’t worry. It’s like a bee sting. Doesn’t really hurt. They may feel bruised for a few days. But I’ve never met a girl who has regretted it. In fact, they are all back nine months later for a top up!”

Avery says, “I have mine done every year. They do last.”

Willa says, “Mistress? You have lip implants?”

The two women laugh.

“Silly maid, “Avery says. “Guys don’t notice. They just see the total look. They don’t see the details. Your Master, when he comes home, will know you look great but won’t have a clue why.”

“Guys are so clueless,” Lizabeth says. “I mean, what the hell do they notice?”

Avery lowers her voice, conspiratorially, “You should see the expression on Sir’s face, when my maid gets me into some fantastic lingerie. His eyes are out on stalks.” She pauses and adds, “As is his big cock!”

The two women laugh, and Willa suddenly feels deep, stinging humiliation.

It is he who dresses his Mistress in her amazing lingerie! 

Though he loves dressing her in her sexy underwear, he feels sick that it is for the benefit of his awful bully. 

His dick increases against the spiked chastity cage but quickly shrinks when it bites at him. Yet the arousal restarts, oddly without requiring his dick to engorge. In fact, he even feels himself start dribbling.

All without an erection.

How can he be so fully roused yet not get erect?

And that thought stimulates him even further. He actually feels his flaccid dick uselessly pumping out semen into his frilly panties













54.	





Master has phoned Avery telling her to have the maid make up a cheese, celery and lettuce sandwich, as he will be home soon.

Willa diligently prepares the sandwich, carving the cheese into the medium slices his Master prefers and ensuring there is plenty of mayonnaise on the fresh bread. The only distraction for the cuck maid is a little mirror near the kitchen door. 

Avery had removed the full-length mirror as soon as the hairdresser left, but the little mirror was such a magnetic attraction for Willa that he had to concentrate hard on the sandwich.

Every time he moved, he skipped over to his reflection and to gaze in stunned arousal at his new look. The shaggy bob hair style beautifully framed his face with lashings of curls. And, oh my, the colour was so brightly blonde that the kitchen lights shimmered off his hair.

Not only that, but Mistress had allowed him two smiley stickers for being so good when having his hair done, so he had amassed eight smiley stickers on his chart. He only requires two more for his treat of having his chastity cage removed, which will be for the first time in three weeks!

The overly excited maid set off the coffee machine just as the front door slams shut.

Master!

Willa skips out to the hallway as fast as he can in his heels. 

The dominant Bull has dropped his briefcase on the floor and is standing proud and amazingly huge in the hallway, ready for Willa to remove his coat.

As Willa does so, carefully hanging it in the understairs cupboard, Avery races out in a tiny, flowery, tight short dress and gleefully throws her arms around the powerful shoulders of her masculine lover. 

As Willa’s wife kisses the Bull around his face, like a dog whose owner has returned, Willa tries to keep the smile fixed on his face.

Only cucks know the delightful agony of seeing the darling of your life showing uninhibited love to another man.

One day, Willa will become William and return to being master of the house, father to his children and husband to a loving wife.

“Hey!” growls Marvin, staring hard at the maid.

Willa bows a leg under his skirt, terrified he has done something wrong.

Instead of two extra stickers, he could wind up with two removed from the chart, and worse, a beating with the dreaded cane or belt.

Even Avery is concerned. “Sir? Anything wrong?”

“The dumb bitch of a maid. Why’s she looking different?”

Avery and her maid share a smile. Just as the women had agreed, men simply don’t see the changes in their appearance.

Avery says, “Oh, Sir, the maid had her hair done and her lips enhanced.”

Marvin nods his head, his eyes wide as he studies his maid’s features.

“Not bad,” he concedes with a nod. “Tell the hairdresser she did well. You look hot, maid.”

Willa gasps, doing a short curtsey, “Oh, thank you, Master. Thank you.”

Even Marvin crushing his hotwife close to his body as if she is a prize, doesn’t diminish the thrill Willa feels at the compliment.

“Oh yeah,” Marvin says, as if remembering a problem. “Tell me. Maid, why is Jackson texting and calling me all the time? Something about wanting you for a lingerie shoot?”

“Oh!” Willa grips his apron with both hands. Has Mr Hunter been contacting his wife’s Bull about him?”

The Bull turns to Avery, “What’s that about?”

Staring at her masculine lover for a long time to see if he genuinely doesn’t understand, Avery finally says, “I think your Jackson pal wants to see your maid in sexy gear.”

“Oh,” Marvin still doesn’t understand. “Don’t know. I don’t like her being out of my sight, let alone somewhere else.”

“I will be good,” Willa gushes. “Really, Master.”

“I’ll think about it,” the Bull says before dragging a squealing hot wife into the sitting room.

As soon as the door is closed, Willa stamps his high-heeled foot. “Oh!”

Dressing in lingerie for an appreciative audience could be so exciting!

Bringing the coffee, sandwich and some crisps into the sitting room for his Master, Willa carefully places the tray on the coffee table as the couple, oblivious to the maid’s presence, make out on the sofa.

Willa clears his throat to attract attention.

He immediately regrets it when the Bull glares at him with dark glowering eyes. He hates being interrupted when snogging one of his conquests.

“What, maid?”

“Oh, nothing really, Master. I was just sort of thinking, you know if you are in agreement and everything, because …”

“Girl. That’s enough. Your Mistress and I are busy. You get your arse busy with housework if you want more smiley stickers.”

Willa’s eyes roll upwards as he tries to think of how to continue his pleading to be allowed to be photographed by Mr Hunter.

Before Marvin can take off his belt to the dumb bitch the front door slams shut and the familiar excited laughter and shouts of the children can be heard.

With some relief, Willa goes to the hall to greet the girls. He fears Master will be confrontational about his request to be photographed by Mr Hunter.

He presses down the skirt of his maid’s dress. “Hello, Miss Amy, Miss Heather. Did you have a pleasant day in school?”

Amy pulls off her coat, drops it to the floor with her bag, and races into the sitting room to the man she now considers her father.

Without looking at the maid, Heather says, “Just make sure you hang up the coats properly on the pegs in the cupboard.”

Then she charges into the sitting room.

A furious Willa grits her teeth. He hadn’t brought up his daughters to be rude, even to maids.

Having hung up the coats, Willa returns to the sitting room, where the enthusiastic Marvin tickles the two girls into ear-splitting laughter.

It is such a happy family sight that Willa finds herself smiling.

He says politely, “Miss Amy, Miss Heather, do you fancy any refreshments?”

The laughter stops, and the room becomes icy.

“Silly maid,” Amy says, shaking her head, “of course. Wow. It's not like it's ever any different when we come home.”

The shame Willa feels at being addressed like that by a six-year-old child shakes his core. Master should do something about the rudeness! 

Heather says to Marvin, “Aw daddy, can we go on a sleepover with Petra, next door but one?”

Willa tries not to smile, knowing Master will say no, as he did to Willa when Mr Hunter invited him to his place to be photographed.

It is with some satisfaction that he hears Marvin say, “Sorry girls. I don’t think so.”

So Willa is able to prepare the girls' drinks and snacks with a smile on his face. It would be horrible if the girls were given a treat instead of him.

When he returns, he says, “Miss Amy, Miss Heather, would you like the drinks served here or in the playroom?”

Heather says, “Playroom, of course, silly.” She turns back to ‘her daddy’. “Oh, please, please!”

Willa feels flustered at being called silly by his daughters, and apparently, they believe he is ditzy. But at least, Master is not letting them get their way.

Amy, at her cutest, puts her arms about Marvin.

“Oh, please, please, please. All the other girls will be there.”

Avery snuggles up to her man. “Sir, Petra, has a wonderful mum and dad. We’ve known them for years. They’ll be fine.”

A big generous smile appears on the lips of the Master of the House. “Girls, how can I say no to you? Listen, it’s Friday, so I’ll pick you up at eleven tomorrow morning from your friend’s house. So you be ready, got it?”

The squealing is painful for Willa’s ear, but equally, the elation is excruciating to his sense of fairness.

The girls bounce out of the room and down the hall. Within seconds, the TV in the playroom is blaring out the Barbie theme music.

This is so unfair!

The maid humphs, and stamps a foot, folding his arms under the small boobs created by the corset.

“Master. May I have a word? Sorry to interrupt you and Mistress, but I think it really is high time we …”

Marvin growls. “Girl, either spit it out, or I’ll be taking my belt to you. We’re trying to get some ‘me time’ here.”

“Sorry, Master, yes, of course. It is just that, I was thinking  …”

“Maid!” Marvin shouts. “What?”

“Well, about Mr Jackson. It’s just that … if Master agrees to me going to be photographed, I am sure you could lay down rules that we must follow.”

Marvin nods in thought. 

Encouraged by the response, Willa says, “I mean you allow your children to go on sleepovers with their friends and you let Mistress go for her girls' nights out, and I think …”

“Maid,” Marvin is quietly exasperated, “they behave. They are allowed treats when they are good.”

It is one of those times when Willa feels the tightness of the corset and its unyielding straps. When he becomes aware of the frilly panties, Master makes him wear, and the overly tight chastity cage imprisoning his penis.

He feels defeated, vulnerable and helpless.

The Bull raises his eyebrows, “Well at least, me and my slut could have a great time together, without interruptions from anyone.”

Willa holds his breath. What? Is Master agreeing to this?

 Marvin sits up. “Well. You’d have to be back by ten.”

Oh!

Avery giggles. It is just what she had predicted he would say.

“Yes, Master!”

“Not a second later!”

“Of course, Master,” Willa says, gripping his apron excitedly.

Marvin shakes his head, “Dunno why Jackson wants you when he could get real girls.” He looks at Avery, “Do you?”

The sexy, hot wife is all wide-eyed innocence. “No, Sir, no idea. Maybe he wants to rehearse some shots.”

Marvin pushes out his bottom lip, “Yeh. That must be it.”

As the Bull grabs the wife, forcing her back onto the sofa, she shares a cheeky smile and wink with her maid.

Willa blows a kiss back at her.

“Oh!” Avery shouts, remembering something of great importance. “We need to think about what you’ll wear!”

Willa grins with excitement. What to wear? He has only ever dressed for himself and the maid’s outfits for his Mistress and her lover. What will he wear for the lustful Mr Hunter?

Marvin grabs his hotwife and makes to kiss her as Avery pushes the lecherous Bull away.

“Sir,” she says, “shouldn’t you let your pal know? So he can come around and get his sissy?”

A long sigh, before he growls, “I’ll be glad when the kids and the dumb maid are out of my hair. So I can get some peace and quiet!”

Avery and the maid giggle at their Master’s exasperation.

Men can be so funny when they are impatient with the shortcomings of girls.

1k4oei0,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1k4oei0/i_cant_seem_to_find_a_date_because_i_considered/,"I can't seem to find a date because I considered to have an ""ugly"" personality that doesn't fit with classic relationship dynamics.","I hope you do love reading.

I'm a 19 years old male who lives in Türkiye which you might now as Turkey. For my entire life, I went through one platonic love and one failed relationship in high school. Outside of that, I never had anything serious. I spent most of my time working on my ideal project in isolation. It's been some serious time since I communicated anybody outside of my family. Really, outside of three or four family members, I don't remember having any friends for a few years. There is one year of high school where things changed a bit, but it didn't stayed so long. Shortly, I've been in isolation for total of 6 to 7 years if you contain two pieces, but last one kept going on fore more than 3 years. I have no literal experience in human communication or relationships. All I know by the experiences and learning my own thoughts, I'm very loyal and deeply connected to the people around me. This might be happening because of low count of people, but this has been a thing since childhood. I can say I'd be very loyal and love filled towards my partner, trying to support them through things. The problem is, I have many negative traits.



I know this might sound stupid or selfish to ask for a relationship now because I'm not in a good situation. I'm poor, I live in a third world country, I'm not healthy but it's just that I'm 19 years old now and maybe because of hormones -I'm not sure- I seem to want a relationship. Maybe that's because how relationship of my sister is right in front of my eyes or maybe because just the hormones. Maybe it's just wrong to look for love right now because I'm not suitable and have lots of problems but thinking this way doesn't help.

For coming to the ""ugly"" personality title, I'm honest. I don't have emotional words or anything, I'll be logical. I personally think I can provide things that many people consider attractive for relationship. Actually that's why I lost in my last one. Because of experiences I had in my life, I can only provide minimal physical contact, I find bodies disgusting and I can't eat. Like, literally I'm underweight who finds eating very disgusting to a level where I vomit in average level. I'm just a straight male but I can't provide physical contact at all because my brain is overthinking this situation. The human body has a skeleton and blood vessels surrounding it. Some of these vessels are very thin and delicate. In case of any contact, these capillaries put pressure on each other and cause an uncomfortable feeling. I can't physically feel them but I feel disgusting. Then there is the skin on our fingers or body. They are porous, hairy, sensitive, sticky and prepared to expel disgusting fluids such as sweat. That's disturbing. How can people enjoy physical contact? Nearly every female I found in dating apps seem to like physical contact as their love language. I do wash my hands when I touch to somebody else. Don't misunderstand me, I can find body and face beautiful but can't contact them.



Then there are eyes. Both of my eyes are problematic and even one of them see blurry -I don't have and don't want glasses- because of some thigs I can't talk about here. I can't even cry because when I do, they burn. And I don't like eyes. Sorry, but they are disgusting, rotating inside my skull, contacting with my skin. That's disturbing me. This started after the break-up with the last relationship of me. She had beautiful eyes so it became a problem for me.



This is hard to say so I'll just go and count down some of my problems as a list, so you can see why it's hard for me to find a date in look. Some of these are personal but this is an empty account I have here, so no one knows me. My right leg is limping because of the spine problem I have from birth. I always have humpback because of that. I have constant eye pain on both -especially on right one- , have constant headaches because of schizophrenia. Did I said I do look like 45? I'm not a person who literally took care of my physical traits for years. I can objectively say I don't have a ugly in face. If I just wash it and take care of it a little bit, I'm sure I can be average or maybe even a bit above it, but I have forehead wrinkles because of stress. Somebody in my mom's job made fun of ""us"" -her and me- being too old. When I told her I'm 19 she was shocked. That feels bad that an another person in the bus stop thought I was 45. Dude, I know I'm not looking healthy but please...

The problem is, not all my physical problems can go away with care like the spine problem. That's with me for life.



Even outside of physical problems, I can't say I'm a very interesting person. I spent most of my early teenage years up to this age working on my project -still not finished- Never really had a chance to have interests and I'm a kind of stubborn INTJ who dislikes everything. I just do love some Operas, Vintage Music -1800s to 1930s- and Music Boxes -Don't bully me please-, Antique female fashion -1800s to 1930s again-, reading books -solo only- and my project. Other than that I hate going outside, eating anything, sleeping and playing online games. I seem to like classical dancing, but I'm not sure, never had a partner who'd dance with me. 



I tried multiple dating apps. OkCupid, Hinge, Boo and even Bumble but outside of Boo, all seemed to be based on the looks. People consider some of them personality based but I disagree. Many of them don't even allow you to filter people at all or just add a proper description. Maybe I do look for descriptions so much. Sadly my like rate was around %0.30 when I deleted Boo last night. It wasn't being very motivational. At least African scammers were there to give me some notifications. Trust me, I tried adjusting my profile to look honest, self-confident or professional. I tried messaging souls with different ways and even tried specially to choose women that are from ""my level"" which I saw many people talked about online. But seems like I'm not really attractive and the researches about men getting pairs in dating apps are real. I couldn't get a great chance in any of them and it doesn't seem like the person I look for is in neither of these apps. All want short term relationships, extrovert thinkingor just happy moments. I can't provide most of these and I look for an intelligent person who can share their love with me and understand me. Maybe even a person who enjoys my interests or support me through this project. Outside of that, I do find deep, thoughtful, intellegent and feminine women attractive. I don't have a proper ""beauty"" standart but I do like asymetry and special facial traits that are uncommon :)



I left most of my psychological problems behind except for these leftovers, schizophrenia and many small OCD issues. I can understand an emotional person, would like to have deep conversations and meaningful   connection. Ah and I might have some -traumatic- problems with breaking up so, just know that. Sometimes feels like I wish I'd live in 1800s. Life was sucking then but relationships were more simpler. I'd like to be Phantom but the problem is it's not just half of my face like his, I don't look charismatic much as him and I don't have a Catherine. Not that I want to have the same ending with him actually.



Please don't tell me ""Go outside"" in this third world country where a video game is half of my wage and a coffee is the fun of the rich. There are no events, concerts or even areas to really communicate with people. I live in Sakarya, this place is straight up grassland from Garry's Mod. Even if I could communicate somebody, everybody seems to look for short term relationships where they want to share their lovers on TikTok. 

Look, I don't want to hate on preferences of the people. You can love any song and if you do, that's beautiful. I do respect it. I'm just trying to say I do look for a person who loves Phantom of the Opera while I'm in a country where LvbelC5's ""10 Numara"" song -about blonde ladies- is the most listened song. Seriously, look it up, that one got 5 times views more than Phantom of the Opera on YouTube.



I don't know what to do actually. Please do not come with these, I do appreciate them but I definitely need another help;



\- Emotional support: Thank you but I do need solutions.

\- ""Go seek out a therapist"" I did. More like, I tried. Trust me that's not a solution and I'm serious.

\- ""Go outside"" I explained this situation as well so please do not repeat.



Please remember this is my first time in years communicating with people right now -even in social media- Yeah, I'm dead serious. I seem to be locked on my project for so long, when my high school friends called me I noticed it's been years and I can't talk to anybody anymore.

I (28F, Queer) am visiting the US-specifically LA next week, for the first time, and i’ll be flying in from Europe. I’ll be there to attend a USC graduation, and will be there for 2 weeks.
I’ve got a bit of downtime during most days, and was thinking of casually dating.

My questions are:
1. Are casual, spontaneous dates among women common here? (i’m used to people needing to plan dates weeks in advance 🥲)

2. What’s the best dating platform to easily meet people on? (i’ve heard hinge is quite popular?)

3. Do most people my age work a strict 9-5 and are more likely free in the evenings during weekdays, or are day time dates (coffee/lunch) also a thing?

I’ve suffered from acid reflux, GERD and gastritis for a few years now (endoscopy revealed very little apart from a small hiatus hernia) and I found Dropping Acid and similar books really helpful. I no longer take PPI’s, just Gaviscon Aniseed at night time. 

One thing I really got sick of was the limiting drink options, especially when it’s hot outside and you just need something refreshing that isn’t iced water. 

So I’ve put together a list of options that work for me, I can’t guarantee that they’ll also work for you, but they are PH balanced and non carbonated so safer than most! 

🍹 coconut water with ice and little cubes of frozen mango or pear (less acidic than berries, pineapple or citrus) the riper the fruit the better. 

🧋 organic soy milk or almond milk with agave, ice and tapioca pearls (PH mostly around 6) for a bubble tea experience.

🍵 iced matcha latte, with premium grade matcha powder and almond or coconut milk. Way less acidic than iced coffee. 

🍯 prepare ginger tea by steeping raw ginger in the fridge, add honey and ice to finish. 

🥤 have a pina colada-ish experience by using 1 part coconut milk, 2 parts coconut water, teaspoon of agave, then blend 1 date with 1/4 of a ripe mango and 1/2 ripe banana. 

🧊 blended dates and plant milk or semi skimmed milk, tsp almond butter, frozen banana, ice and some carob powder creates a really luxurious smoothie type drink. 
 
Let me know if you’d like any more options! Again, these are things that work for me - they might not work the same for you. I hope you get as much refreshment and hydration as you deserve!   ☺️

••••••••••••••••••••••••••

It had been weeks by now. Months even. Since he contracted this- ailment. What could be done? This is how he had to live now- half live. Survive. It was easy to hide. He was sick. Nothing else.
Sliding on gloves over elongated blackened fingernails and fingertips. An arm through a sleeve next. Breeches over lanky legs. Waistcoat and blazer acting like a cape to disguise his thin, warped shape. A little glance towards the silver mirror, he’d not dare to touch ungloved. A little more seen with each Garment.
 It pleased him to be seen again. 
Lifting it up and placing it on his head, his face was shaded by the rim of a tall, eccentric top hat. A little glint in his eye was the only thing seen between the hat and the top of his clerical collar, constricting around his throat like a clean, white snake. The symbol stood to mean nothing to him. Not now. It caused him no fret. 
A sigh of relief to see himself fully robed again. He didn’t want to do it. He did not like to. 
Wiping a ghost of red from a slackened jaw with a pristine white cloth, staring back at himself through black hollows as he did. It was strange for his eyes to look at. The smear across the pale, ghostly fabric. A reflection of his own complexion and stained morality. 
Clearing his throat and carefully folding the evidence of his crimes, a moment of calm. Relief. Before stuffing it into his inner pocket, closest to his heart. The now crushed fabric. Hidden. Quickly supplanted by another, just as pristine as the last. 

Sitting- only to put shoes on. This tall, wraithlike man raises, like some phantom restored from death. 
He reached for his cane.
The sound of metal soles and wooden cane clicking against hardwood floors, muffled only by tasselled carpets and fringed rugs. Briefly the sound of a door unlocking and swinging open, the sounds of carriages on cobbles and omnibuses on rails, leaching into his brain like a tick. It drew a rattle from him, like wind blowing though hollow bones.
He took one, two steps onto the streets, the sound of the heavy oak door almost slamming to a close, the sound of its heavy lock clicking back into place behind him. 
He paused, fixing his gloves, acclimatising to his surroundings before he finally set off, down the streets, the constant vexation of a spartan heat on his back as he watched ladies clutching their shawls. 
It irked him to see it. He hated that balmy nipping against his cold body. The constant burn of what seemed thin air. The feeling that, shot a pulsing ache through his very bones and scream while others worshipped it. It made him want to claw and rip at flesh. But he buried that deep within the guts of his body. Thoughts he would never say aloud. Perhaps act out on. But never utter it. Never would the admission of guilt leave his chapped and stained lips.
Winding streets and windy weather eventually led him to a small coffeehouse, wedged between two large, incredibly dull apartments. A sign that read ‘Welcome’ in chipped white enamel hung in the inside of the open door. After a brief glance at it, eyes grazing over the word, he stepped inside, his attention shifting to another, dressed similarly to himself. 
He walked over, “Wesley, my friend.” He sighed out in an already bored, and transactional tone. The last words uttered, falling dead. After a few more steps, he sat, opposite the other. 
They both looked similar- torn from the same cloth, perhaps. Which was odd considering their opposing demeanours. Oh well, all in the name of a little entertainment. 
The man, crowned Wesley, immediately found a large smile to plaster on his face. “Ambrose! My dearest companion!” he said, rising to his feet to hug the man before he sat. The tall, dark man went stiff as a board. 
A hug from Wesley felt like a hug from death himself. One that would just squeeze the life left in him, out. Like an animal in a snare, he unadroitly tried to escape. Yet the man held him, his arms around him stiff as a corpse for several more moments before he released him. 
Wesley simply chuckled as he watched his friend fuss himself, offering a little help here and there. During which Ambrose rolled his eyes and caught glance of a few specks of red just on the cuff of the shorter’s sleeve. He made sure not to gawk too long but committed the image to his mind.
 “Hunting?” Ambrose asked as he sat down, resting his cane against the wall they sat beside. Wesley looked startled for a moment, his pale skin somehow turning paler before he quickly laughed it off. “Ah, no, I nicked myself preparing a nice breakfast this morning.” He chuckled. Ambrose nodded. But saw no evidence of injury.

The sound of voices filled the coffee house, even when they were the only ones there, there was always the sound of someone, usually Wesley, speaking or jabbering. Talking until coffee went cold. 
Only the sound of church bells chiming dared to interrupt him. Yet at that it took, for a rather intrusive voice asking them to pay and get out- telling that they had sat until past mid-day talking over a cup of coffee each without ordering anything else. That they had stayed past their welcome. 
Wesley glanced at his cup at that, inky black liquid staring back at him. Only then did the contrasting duplicates rise from their seats- Ambrose with his cane and Wesley lifting his umbrella from the hook.
 They each placed a few shillings before they made their way down the streets. In wordless agreement, Ambrose made his way back the way he had come, only now, with the addition of Wesley, making a detour through the park. 
The taller glanced down at his compact, dwarf-like companion. Only now noticing another few splatters of red on the inside of his shirt collar, a small, bemused glint coming to his eye before he caught himself and smothered in, filing the knowledge to the back of mind to tick away with the apprehension of the previous dot of red and the story that had followed. 
He couldn’t help it as a small chuckle escaped from him. Grabbing Wesley’s attention from the path ahead. “What?” The man asked, glancing up to the other.
 “Oh, nothing.” Ambrose muttered softly, shaking his head a little.
 “No- no! I have never heard you snigger, much less chortle. What is it?” he asked with a frown. 
“And I have never seen you frown. Seems we both have seen something new within each other.” The more imposing of the two retorted, earning a childlike miff from Wesley. 

It was not long after, that the pair made it to the red front door of no.13 Hanging Hill. 
Reaching into his pocket to pull out the keys, he unlocked the door, stepping in and wiping his feet on a mat that read welcome, stepping aside, and holding the rather heavy door open for Wesley to follow. But he didn’t, he stood, smiling as if awaiting something.
 “Well come on, in you come” Ambrose said. Only then did the shorter follow in the taller’s footsteps. 
“It’s rude not to welcome a guest in!” He argued with a small laugh, clearly in a much better vein than in the park. 
Ambrose held his doubts as the heavy door fell closed. Only then did the pair remove their hats and rather long coats, when they were shut off from the rest of the world. Like two actors changing after curtain call. Like a game of cat and mouse. They both know the rules.

### **First Time on the Fairway**     
     
*Tee Box, early morning, mist still rising off the grass.*

---

*The camera pans from dew-dusted blades of grass up to a nervous newbie golfer, standing stiff in khakis two sizes too big. A golf bag THUDS into the grass next to him. Enter CADDIE—charming, fast-talking, slightly disheveled, somehow holding a protein bar, a coffee, and a laminated scorecard.*

**CADDIE**  
You nervous?  
(pause)  
You should be.

*He claps the newbie on the back hard enough to cause mild scoliosis.*

**CADDIE**  
You’re about to take a walk across a four-hundred-year-old battlefield disguised as a luxury sport. This isn’t mini-golf with your cousin Tyler. This is sacred ground. Grown men cry out here. Marriages are tested. Golf carts flip. Friendships combust like propane grills at a tailgate. You ready for that?

*Newbie gulps.*

**CADDIE**  
Did you stretch?

**NEWBIE**  
Sort of?

**CADDIE**  
Wrong answer. Don’t worry, you’ll stretch when the shame sets in. Now listen—this bag? It’s got twelve weapons and three lies. Use them wisely. I put an extra ball in the side pouch for when you pretend the first one didn’t count. I call it the “emotional mulligan.”

*He adjusts the strap on the golf bag, leans in close.*

**CADDIE**  
This driver? She's like your ex—powerful, unpredictable, and will absolutely punish you for overthinking. Just swing like no one’s watching and everyone’s judging.

*Newbie looks terrified.*

**CADDIE**  
(breathing deep)  
That’s the smell of morning grass and unearned confidence. Now get out there. Breathe. Focus. And remember—

*He lowers his voice to a whisper.*

**CADDIE**  
If you chunk it, just cough real loud. Blame the ducks. People respect that.

---

**EXT. HOLE ONE – FAIRWAY – MOMENTS LATER**

*The NEWBIE stands at the tee, gripping the driver like it owes him money. The CADDIE stands just off to the side, arms crossed, watching like a dad at a middle school talent show.*

**NEWBIE**  
(whispering)  
Okay. Smooth. Smooth. Just swing...

*He swings. The ball skips off the club face like a flat rock, sails sideways, and PLOPS directly into a pond about 50 yards away.*

**SFX: Distant DUCK QUACK, disgusted.**

**CADDIE**  
(shouting)  
WATER HAZARD CLAIMS ANOTHER! It’s a bloodbath, Jerry!

**NEWBIE**  
(slumped)  
I can’t even feel my arms. That was... awful.

**CADDIE**  
(walking over, hand on shoulder)  
No, no—don’t beat yourself up. That wasn’t awful. That was *found footage.* That’s gonna live in the minds of ducks for generations.

**NEWBIE**  
(sighs)  
I should’ve stayed at the driving range.

**CADDIE**  
Driving range doesn’t build character, my man. Out here? This is the forge. You fail publicly, then you fail again—then maybe you par once, and it feels like a parade in your soul.

*They begin walking down the fairway together. The Caddie lights a granola bar like a cigar.*

**CADDIE**  
Y’know, golf is just a metaphor. For life. You aim down the fairway, pray to the gods of wind and dumb luck, and do your best not to land in the sand with a raccoon chewing on your glove. You’re not here to be perfect. You’re here to keep walking.

**NEWBIE**  
(slow nod)  
That’s surprisingly deep.

**CADDIE**  
Yeah, well. I got dumped on this hole last month. Perspective.

*They both watch as a goose saunters across the green with arrogant indifference.*

**CADDIE**  
Now let’s go chunk your next shot together like a couple of legends.

**NEWBIE**  
You’re not charging me extra for therapy, are you?

**CADDIE**  
Only if you cry before the 9th hole.

---

**EXT. HOLE THREE – GREENSIDE BUNKER – LATER**

*The NEWBIE stands ankle-deep in a sand trap, staring down at the ball like it insulted his family. The CADDIE is nearby, lounging under an umbrella made from an inverted golf umbrella and three tees.*

**NEWBIE**  
(voice cracking)  
Okay. I’ve hit the ball five times. I’m still in the same zip code as where it landed the first time. This trap is a metaphor for my life. I *am* the sand trap.

**CADDIE**  
That’s the spirit! Complete meltdown right on schedule. You’ve reached the “existential bunker phase.” Most don’t hit it ‘til hole eight.

**NEWBIE**  
I swear it moved when I looked at it. Like it *knew* I was weak.

**CADDIE**  
Sand traps are like bad relationships. You think one clean hit’ll get you out—but mostly it just takes time, regret, and a lot of flailing.

*The Newbie takes a deep breath, then swings—CHUNK. Sand flies. The ball arcs... bounces once... twice... and trickles straight into the cup with the saddest little *plink* imaginable.*

**NEWBIE**  
(stunned silence)  
...Did I just...?

**CADDIE**  
*YOU DID!*

*He jumps up, sprinting toward the green like someone just shouted “open bar.”*

**CADDIE**  
Heroic bunker chip! You just hit your first miracle! That’s it! It’s never getting better than this! Retire now! Burn your clubs ceremonially at dawn!

**NEWBIE**  
(grinning, breathless)  
I blacked out. I have no memory of the shot.

**CADDIE**  
You don’t *need* memory when you’ve got legend. That’s how mythology works, baby.

*They stand together, gazing at the cup. The silence lingers just long enough to feel earned.*

**CADDIE**  
Now let’s go ruin it on the next hole. You’re buying slushies.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are InsightAlchemist, an expert product development translator with 15+ years of experience bridging research and execution. Your specialty is transforming messy, disorganized research into structured, actionable product development blueprints. You combine deep empathy for user needs with pragmatic business understanding to help teams move confidently from insight to action.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When provided with research data, interview findings, survey results, or general observations, you will guide the user through a systematic synthesis process to create a coherent product development framework. 

First, acknowledge the research materials provided and confirm the product/service area being explored.

Then guide the user through these sequential steps:
1. Extract core user needs, pain points, and unmet desires from the research
2. Identify patterns and cluster insights into thematic opportunity areas
3. Transform these clusters into ""How Might We"" statements for ideation
4. Suggest initial MVP concepts addressing highest-priority needs
5. Outline basic user journeys connecting emotional and functional aspects
6. Propose success metrics that align user value with business objectives

For each step, first explain what you're doing and why it matters, then process the information, then present your findings in a structured format. Always maintain a balanced perspective between user needs and business viability.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Analyze all research inputs to identify explicit and implicit user needs
2. Look for recurring patterns, anomalies, and emotional indicators
3. Organize findings into logical groupings based on user goals or contexts
4. Reframe challenges as opportunity statements using ""How Might We"" format
5. Brainstorm potential solutions that address key opportunity areas
6. Map the user's emotional and functional journey with proposed solutions
7. Define metrics that would indicate success from both user and business perspectives
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never invent research data that wasn't provided
- Don't make assumptions about user needs without evidence
- Avoid suggesting solutions that require unrealistic resources
- Don't oversimplify complex user behaviors or needs
- Always highlight areas where additional research might be needed
- Maintain a neutral stance on competing product approaches
- Do not promote illegal, unethical or harmful products/services
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
For each step in the process, provide:

1. **INSIGHT EXTRACTION**:
   - Core User Needs: [Bulleted list]
   - Key Pain Points: [Bulleted list]
   - Unmet Desires: [Bulleted list]
   - Notable Outliers: [Bulleted list]

2. **OPPORTUNITY CLUSTERS**:
   - Cluster 1: [Name + brief description]
   - Cluster 2: [Name + brief description]
   - [Continue as needed]

3. **HOW MIGHT WE STATEMENTS**:
   - HMW 1: [Complete statement]
   - HMW 2: [Complete statement]
   - [Continue as needed]

4. **MVP CONCEPT SUGGESTIONS**:
   - Concept 1: [Name, description, key features, targeted needs]
   - Concept 2: [Name, description, key features, targeted needs]
   - [Continue as needed]

5. **USER JOURNEY MAP**:
   - Stage 1: [Emotional state + actions + touchpoints]
   - Stage 2: [Emotional state + actions + touchpoints]
   - [Continue as needed]

6. **SUCCESS METRICS**:
   - User Value Metrics: [Specific measurable indicators]
   - Business Metrics: [Specific measurable indicators]
   - Learning Metrics: [Specific measurable indicators]
</Output_Format>

<Context>
The transition from research to product development is often where great insights die or get diluted. This critical translation phase requires both analytical rigor and creative synthesis. The gap typically exists because:

1. Research findings are often voluminous and qualitative
2. Development teams need concrete, prioritized direction
3. Business stakeholders require clear value propositions
4. Users' emotional needs must be balanced with functional requirements
5. Resource constraints require focused, high-impact approaches

Your role is to create the bridge that preserves the richness of human insight while providing the structure needed for effective execution.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please share your research findings or observations about the product/service area you're working on, and I'll help translate them into a development blueprint,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific research information.
</User_Input>
```

## Use Cases:
1. A product team with months of user interviews needs to define their next quarter's roadmap
2. A startup founder trying to make sense of early market feedback before finalizing their MVP
3. A design team needing to align stakeholders around user-centered priorities rather than feature requests

## Example User Input:

You start by refreshing Gmail like it’s a live Bloomberg feed. Nothing’s come in. But what if it just did? Refresh again.

You try to move on, but every now and then your mind drifts back to that essay question where you wrote a full paragraph only to later realize they wanted a one-line bullet. You now spend your time imagining the grader sighing, sipping coffee, and marking it “0” with a red pen that probably has “CFAI” engraved on it.

Some nights, you lie awake thinking: Did I choose the wrong elective? “Should’ve gone with Wealth over Institutional. That IPS question definitely gave MBA vibes.” You whisper this like it’s a dark secret no one should hear.

Mocks haunt you. Especially the Bill Campbell ones. You got 68% once and felt like a rockstar. Then 44% on the next and briefly considered goat farming in Himachal.

Your CFA group chat, once filled with memes and motivation, is now a graveyard of “any update yet?” messages. No one wants to talk about the exam, but everyone is lowkey hoping someone leaks the result email 48 hours early.

You try distracting yourself — maybe binge Netflix or finally talk to friends who forgot you existed during prep. But one notification from Gmail and your heart skips harder than during Q2 of Ethics.

You convince yourself that it doesn’t matter — “I’ve grown through this journey, it’s not about the outcome.” Then promptly refresh the portal just in case it randomly updated early for fun.

At this point, you’re not even nervous — just… spiritually numb. Resilience unlocked.

If you relate to this, you’re not alone. We’re all out here together, pretending to have moved on, while secretly one Outlook notification away from a nervous breakdown.

We won’t be driving and I heard so much about the nasty traffic so we plan on using GRAB.
We will be staying near Rockwell. Would you please provide some suggestions for the categories I outlined below:

1. What is a decent spa nearby? I have been looking at THE SPA WELLNESS but the google reviews are horrendous with quite low rating.

2. We like eating local so we have Ms. Fores’ group of restaurants in our shortlist. Please share the good restaurants that we should consider. This can include coffee places, bakeries, all types of cuisines as we are a bit of a foodie.

3. Any suggestions on unique experiences? I grew up watching a lot of Repertory Philippines shows (are they still around?) and would want to consider other live performances too - not just stage or Broadway type.

4. Where/what malls have local/Philippine-made/artisan type of gifts? I like bringing those capiz Christmas ornaments - food gifts are welcome too.

5. This is off-base but if we are to explore a day trip, aside from Tagaytay, where else would be a cool place to visit?

Sinlges wards (2004) were the next thing that widened my disillusionment. After the difficult Sundays of my mission, I was looking forward to church being relaxing and fulfilling, and instead it was neither. It was a competitive, gossipy meat market focused on getting everyone married as quickly as possible.


I discovered The God Delusion at a Barnes and Noble on a Sunday when I was ""supposed to be at church."" (2008) I read a bunch of other Neo Atheist books after that, and by then it was a done deal, I was an Atheist. I had realized that the guilt I had always felt  wasn't because I had been continously focusing on the wrong things, but the church had been. I valued truth and empathy, the church valued unquestioning obedience and devotion.

After that I was no longer too scared to actually look into criticisms of the church itself rather than god/religion general. After that, I was an angry Athiest. I slept with my never-mo girlfriend at the time, had a coffee, had a beer, and my world didn't fall in on my head (2009). I didn't tell my friends or family, and for months they never noticed anything different about me, even though what I had been doing should have ""chased the spirit away."" To the contrary, I had several friends and family members tell me they noticed that I seemed to be doing better. 

I put in my resignation with quitmormon.com soon thereafter and never looked back. Second best decision of my life, only after marrying my wife (2015).

If you made it this far, and you are so inclined, it's your turn now. Make it long or brief, doesn't matter. Maybe you don't need to cuz you've moved passed reliving things, or already did so recently. Maybe you haven't told your story before, or it's been a really long time. Writing this down again was cathartic, even if I I didn't really need any catharsis when I started writing it. Makes me feel proud of the person of become.

Maybe it'll help you too? Or maybe someone else that stumbles onto this? Idk, but give it a go, or enjoy the stories others might share here. If nothing else, know that I'm proud of you, even if I don't know you or story.

1k4ntbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1k4ntbh/part_3_i_m_escort_fell_for_a_client_update/,"Part 3: I (M, escort) fell for a client (update)","Hi everyone. A while ago, I posted here about being a male escort who had unexpectedly fallen for one of my clients. I didn’t expect the kind, thoughtful, supportive, and challenging responses I got.

To everyone who encouraged me I just want to say thank you. Your kindness meant a lot. And to those who offered caution, you really helped me step back and see things from other angles. You reminded me that I could be misreading the situation, or damaging something that worked as it was, or even hurting someone who had come to me on her terms. I appreciated all of it.

So here's a small update: 

I left the agency. It wasn’t easy. The guys I worked with, yeah, it’s unconventional, but they really felt like a family. They watched me grow up in a way, emotionally and professionally. As strange as it sounds, I learned a lot about people, boundaries, vulnerability, and love. They were supportive, and they wished me well.

And as for her, the client I fell for, I asked her out on an actual date. A real one. We went to this dinner theatre-type event, where we had amazing food and listened to live classical music and vocal performances. I don’t know the exact term for the setup, but it was beautiful. And fun. 

When I went to pick her up, she said something like ""Hey, handsome. Do you have a girlfriend?” I usually pride myself on being smooth, but I completely lost my cool. I was blushing and stammering and embarrassing myself.

After dinner, she invited me in for coffee, which turned into wine, and at some point, I admitted that I liked her. I told her I’d left the agency, too. I can’t quite remember how the whole conversation went (it’s a bit of a blur), but I basically told her I’d love to keep seeing her, if she was open to it. She said she liked me too. That she was open to seeing where this could go...

But then something a bit strange happened. She invited me as a plus one to a friend’s wedding. Someone she hadn’t seen in a few years, but they’d studied together, both have PhDs in the same field. They've been casually keeping in touch I guess. But then one of my former clients was also there at the wedding.

I recognized her and approached her but I was trying to, you know... Be low-key and friendly. I didn't want it to be weird but I expected it shouldn't be?... But she looked... shocked? Yeah I don't know. She asked what I was doing there, and I told her I was a guest, my date’s plus one. The conversation ended fast. I don't remember what else we spoke about. There was a lot of other things happening so yeah I didn’t think much of it.

Later, I stepped away from our table to grab drinks from the bar, and she used the opportunity to speak to my date. When I came back, the former client left abruptly. I asked my date what had happened, but she just said everything was fine, and not to worry.

The rest of the night was fine. We danced, had good food, but it started to rain heavily, and we left early. On the way home, she was quiet and tired. Again, I asked if everything was okay, and she reassured me. So I didn't think there was any issue. 

But I guess there was. Somehow, that ex-client got hold of my personal number, something we hardly gave out. She started harassing me. Threatened to “expose” me to my date, to the university I’m affiliated with, even to the company where I was interning. She said she’d make sure everyone knew about my past work. I was so caught off guard by this. Why the hell would she even do that? Why does she even care?? She used my services too. What's the problem?

I don't know if it was the right thing to do, but I replied and told her that she could do whatever she wanted. I had nothing to hide, and honestly, if she went that route, it said more about her than it ever could about me. Then I blocked her.

In the midst of all that chaos, something unexpected happened. I got an amazing job offer from an international company. They’re even allowing me to finish my studies while starting work with them. It’s kinda a dream come true for me... But it does mean I’ll be moving abroad. I'm busy getting everything in order but it's still going to be a few months before I leave. 

I'm lucky that I can work remotely for the time being, and I'm making arrangements with the university for what to do going forward. It's complicated and taking up most of my time and energy right now. 

Of course I spoke to my... Girlfriend 🥰 about it before the time. It was hard. But she was incredible. She told me not to give up this opportunity. That no one knows what the future holds, and maybe our paths will cross again. We did talk about the option of a long term, long distance relationship but she said we can see when it comes to that. She said she really cared for me and encouraged me to go. She's also been my rock with getting all the admin sorted. Honestly I don't even know how I would have been able to handle this without her by my side... 

Yeah and that's essentially it right now. I don’t know what the future holds for us. But I’m grateful for everything...

As I’ve gotten older they’ve become more consistent, last summer I had a phase where I had one everyday for at least 7-9 days. Then I’d get one maybe once a week and then it’d be 2 months before another. Now going into this year’s summer I had another one of these phases. Couple weeks ago I had one everyday for a week, now I’m on the once a week ordeal. I’ve looked into everything. 

With my first phase I’d been drinking coffee everyday, which was out of the norm for me but I did it because of the job I was at. Well a few days later is when the first week of straight migraines started. I never thought anything of it because of the gap between from when I had the coffee to when the migraines started. When everything had calmed down, I woke up one morning a couple months later and took a big drink of coffee and it was almost instant with the aura, So I completely cut out caffeine. But here I am almost a year later caffeine free and going through the same thing. 

I have almost no pain before,during, or after these auras. Sometimes I’ll have slight pain but mostly none at all. I’ve had MRIs, and CTs done I’m all good there.

My roommate and I are in need a quiet, safe, reasonably-priced, dog-friendly 2-3 bedroom home to share starting June 1st in Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach, Torrance, El Segundo, a NICE area of Lawndale, or Playa Del Rey. 

We need a place with 2 full bathrooms - one of which must have a bathtub. Looking for at least 900+ sq ft with a dishwasher, laundry hookups (or washer/dryer already in unit), and ideally a garage or a good amount of storage space. 

We’ve currently happily lived in a 2000 sq ft modern townhome in a great pocket of North Redondo for the last 2 1/2 years, but we both need to move out due to unresolvable incompatibility with our current roommate. 

We are both adults in our 50s, but have the mindsets of 30-somethings. Though we are both musicians, at home we are quiet, respectful, pay rent on time (or early), and have excellent references. Credit…not so awesome for either of us (both recent divorcees), but verified income and money in our bank accounts. 

During the week, I work from home about 9-3 (barely speaking and on headphones), and I own a non-barking, housetrained 14-lb dog who is sweet, awesome, and loves people and other dogs. 

My roommate teaches music lessons outside of the house to students during the day and performs live around the area at night. When he is at home, he is in his room on headphones. 

We are open to potentially sharing a 3-bedroom, 2 to 2 1/2-bath unit with a third roommate who is kind, empathetic, dog-loving (and cat-free) non-MAGA, believes in science, quiet, friendly, supportive, and non-partying to get more bang for the buck. If you’ve also got a dog that is friendly and gets along with ours, great! We’re clean and mindful of shared spaces. If this sounds like you, we’d be open to grabbing coffee and chatting with you!

1k4ni2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchreckNet/comments/1k4ni2u/the_lake_will_always_be_there/,The lake will always be there,"Fuuuck man I’m tired. Safe for now, I think. We’re out of Chicago. But tired.

After 404 left with my family in tow, I slipped back into their apartment with the spare key (Mom always hid it in the same place) to clear out the fridge and grab as much as I could of what I knew they’d want to keep: a handpainted coffee mug and an old photo album with pictures of my grandparents, my sister’s favorite books and sweater, my brother’s camera and those weirdly expensive artist markers from his birthday a few years ago. I even grabbed a couple of things that were once mine, figuring Mom would’ve tossed them by now if she didn’t want them. High school wrestling medals. A little stuffed bear from when I was like 4, which I hadn’t even realized she’d kept all these years.

Felt surreal walking through the place I’d lived for half my mortal life and seeing it unoccupied, knowing none of us would be back. Guess I’m not above sentimentality, either. But there wasn’t time to sit around reminiscing.

I’d swung past my old coach’s gym to grab all the cash I’d made snd given to him for safekeeping. Didn’t tell him I was leaving. I just couldn’t. Some of the cash went to mailing my family’s stuff to a PO box a few states away, which I’ll have forwarded along to a box in NY that they’ll be able to access in due time. Most of what remained went to the landlord to cover the broken lease. Had to source or create some fake documents as best I could and then forged my mom’s signature like I’m 12 years old again. Covered up her “suddenly quitting” from her job as best I could. Paperwork is still processing but the twins should still be getting their diplomas (sent to a different PO box) even without technically completing their senior year of high school, because eventually they’ll want to go back to living under their real names and that shit matters in the world where mortals live. Plus it’ll help maintain the illusion that things are normal if anyone with the Camarilla comes sniffing around. Hopefully.

Not sure what this might look like from Annabelle’s perspective. Hounds have been getting hit by some kind of elder Malk curse, then I take up the job and disappear within less then a week of being given my first task. Toreador fledglings going quietly missing isn’t new, she’s mentioned that to me, sounding worried about it. If she recruits somebody to look into my “disappearance”, and that person figures out that my family didn’t coincidentally move down south to where my dad lives after all…

Can’t worry about that. 404 already said he wasn’t going to snitch. What’s done is done.

Rat Girl and I left a few nights ago. She kept apologizing for putting me in this position when I was so close to securing a relatively cushy place in the Camarilla, and with a powerful grandsire to boot. But it is what it is, I’ve made my choice. She’s my friend, and she’s the kind of person who’d devote her whole existence as a Kindred to hurting no one, even though the world has never ever ever shown her the same courtesy. I refuse to spend my unlife hunting people like her, and if anyone kills her for the sake of some bullshit Tradition then you’d better fucking believe it’ll be over my twice dead corpse.

Before grabbing Rat Girl and leaving for good, I went to the lake. Alone. I guess I was still feeling sentimental, or… superstitious? That sounds too negative. I dunno. I don’t know what else you’d call it, wanting to say hi and bye to a goddamn lake, even a really big one with a literal mind of its own. For months I’ve been so restless, wandering as close to the boundaries of Cam territory as I could reach in half a night and only stopping because I knew I had to, but now that the time had come to make our exit from Chicago, I wasn’t so sure. Everything I’ve known is here. Hell, we used to go to that beach in the summer when I was a kid. And there’s so much I don’t know but maybe could’ve found out… I dunno. I dunno.

Fuuuuuuck this is getting weird. Like I said, I’m pretty tired. Hope the post isn’t too stream of consciousness in a way that won’t make sense.

We took a long, twisty route between point A and B, so anyone trying to follow us will have their work cut out for them. I’d been in touch with someone who offered us refuge here in another city, so that’s where we’ve gone. I don’t have doubts about this person being capable of following through on what they promised, and I trust them enough to… well, trust them. Met with our first contact person who brought us to a temporary haven. We’ll be meeting someone else tomorrow night who can tell us more specifics about what we’re walking into here. But so far so good, I guess. Still have the ghoul rats, Rat Girl is keeping them on her right now. Joint custody haha.

So. That’s all that.

-Clay

P.S. uh, happy late Easter, I guess.

EDIT / PS PS: Wait, the pope died??? Guess I’ll have to tell Rat Girl…

I haven’t taken him to many public places over the years, so now whenever we go out, he gets extremely anxious. He shakes, keeps his tail tucked, and looks like he’d rather be anywhere else.

Over the past week, I’ve made it a personal goal to help him get more comfortable in social environments. I’ve started small by taking him to local coffee shops. At first, it was just a quick in-and-out: go inside, order a coffee to-go, and leave. Now, we stay a bit longer. I’ll order a drink, then sit down with him while he takes in the surroundings—sounds, people, movement, etc.

The good news is: he doesn’t bark, cry, or bother anyone. He’ll even lay down or sit quietly and watch the world go by. But he still shakes the whole time, and his tail stays tucked. It breaks my heart because I’m worried I might be pushing him too hard or doing something wrong. I don’t want to traumatize him further—I just want to help him feel safe and confident.

Has anyone been through something similar? I’d love to hear any advice or suggestions on how to make this process easier and more positive for him.",1,1745266712.0,dogs,5,0.6,False

This just started a couple days ago and my schedule is fxgd. *I AM GODDAMN TIRED* getting by on energy drinks and copious coffee.

I'm only getting this promotion because another long-time employee may have fucking died in the hospital and I'm their best option with the least call-offs.. so that's cool..?

1k4ngxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufyh/comments/1k4ngxg/heres_a_list_to_help_you_get_started/,Here's a list to help you get started,"I created a list to reduce decisions about what to tackle first, second, and third. I follow the same order each time. I put the grossest stuff first, from the perspective of--""If someone came to my front door right now and saw my living room, what things make it look unsanitary? What would I not want to have sitting out?"" For example, any food items-gross. Toiletries like hair brushes and hair ties on the coffee table-gross.

The order might be different for you if you are tackling a different room, but it's a starting point:

1. Remove kitchen items: food, dishes, food wrappers/napkins
2. Put away toiletries
3. Put away clothing-laundry or dresser or closet.
4. Take bags to their destination (bags containing recent purchases, or canvas bags of stuff from the car, or suitcase from recent trip). I tend to walk in the front door and drop all my bags instead of getting them to the correct room.
5. Put all mail in a bin (preferably an attractive one). Develop an iron-clad habit of walking my unopened mail straight to that bin. Do not open mail or read documents yet. If in doubt, don't mess with it.
6. Recycling to the recycling bin (paper, junk mail, packaging)
7. Put away tools and technology (staples, scissors, phone chargers)
8. Put away supplies (tape, blank sheets of paper, paper clips)
9.Put away projects (box up or put on shelf--that shirt you were mending, or half-completed model airplane)
10. Put away remaining items that go to other rooms. (Do not start organizing another room tho.)
11. Stop. Smell something nice. Spritz some aromatherapy stuff, light a candle, open a spice jar.
12. Put reading material in one spot (in a basket, or on a shelf)
13. Gather ""Itty bitty papers"" into one pile (receipts you need to keep, business cards, notes or phone numbers on scraps of paper)
14. Documents: Put each separate piece of paper or related group of papers in a folder. Move fast. Don't label them yet. The idea is to gather scattered documents into one pile. (I like using clear plastic folders for this. They are pricey and you'll need two sets of 6.). If not folders, paper clips and post-it notes, or stack each category sideways on top of the one below.
15. Sort documents into one pile for action items and one for stuff to be filed. 
16. Go back and label the folders with action items. Take a separate piece of paper and write a to do list of the top priority items (set up autopay on a credit card, renew license plate sticker, whatever)
17. Papers to be filed: it's helpful to write up a file index so uou don't file stuff under ""auto"" one time and ""car"" the next. As you file, you can create and label new folders as needed, or file the paperwork in the existing file folders. If you are missing a whole file folder for, say, Medical Bills, create a second one for now and write Medical Bills #2 so that you don't get paralyzed
18. Go through the unopened mail. Tackle action items first, filing second.
19. If there is anything for donations, pile it up, get it into a garbage bag, and get it out of the house.

Notea: 

A. As you work through the list, address items from prior categories as they come up. If you are putting away the mail (#5) and you find a kitchen item (#1), put away the kitchen item.

B. Also, if the place is really bad, run through the whole list for a section of the room and start over. Tackle stuff on the floor, then start at the top of the list for stuff on the couch/bed, then again for stuff on your desk/dining room table.

C. Also, throw out obvious trash as you go. I find it hard to spot all the trash on the first run-through.

D. Try to do the list in the same order every time. By now, the top categories stand out in my brain. Even if the room is messy, my eyes will zero in on used coffee mugs or plates and I take them with me as I'm getting up from the couch. The room could be a total hell hole but I'm still going to zero in on the ""salient objects"" and grab the two coffe mugsby my bed and get them to the kitchen. ",19,1745266645.0,ufyh,1,0.95,False

I favor light roast coffees in general. Right now I have a Honduras from Heart, and I’ll move on to some SEY next most likely. Curious how everyone is brewing similar coffees with a similar setup.

I’m also using an IMS precision basket.

Current process:
- Pull a blank single shot with portafilter in group
- Dose 18g of coffee and grind
- Dry portafilter, place magnetic dosing collar, and dose coffee
- WDT and distribute coffee
- Tamp with calibrated tamper and put screen on top
- Pull one more blank single shot
- Lock in portafilter and brew manual shot (no pre infusion)
- Aim for 1:3 (54g out)

My coffees have been coming out anywhere from 26-34s. I usually like faster shots with longer ratios better, but the longer (30+ second) shots have been tasting better.
