I'm new to the world of luxury candles and looking for recommendations. I love the vibe of D.S. Durga's Breakfast Leipzig and Harlem's Speakeasy. Has anyone here tried them? 

I have been leaning into cardamom-coffee scents or woodsy fragrances (Brooklyn Candle's Fern & Moss is lovely). Sometimes coffee scented candles can be too sweet and woodsy scents can be too masculine/piney. Unisex is fine, and actually preferred, as long as the top notes don't overpower everything else. I'm open to suggestions! I know Diptyque and Trudon are quite popular, but they are too expensive for me. If there are brands I'm missing, aside from the two I'm debating between, please let me know. :) 

My only gripe with Brooklyn Candle Co is the weak throw- I've had much better luck with their reeds, but I like the coziness of candles.

1fw89s9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1fw89s9/i_think_dota_2_as_great_as_the_game_design_is_has/,"I think Dota 2, as great as the game design is, has a serious ""lack of dopamine"" issue for beginners","There have been many theories on why Dota has not been able to attract and retain new players like some other games (including major competitors like LoL), they range from really valid concerns such as complexity of game mechanics to less valid concerns like toxic player base (as if LoL isn't rated T for Toxic lol).

But one thing I haven't seen being mentioned much is that as a ~~drug~~ game, Dota 2 doesn't offer nearly as much of that initial dopamine hit to new players like many other popular games do.

In fact I would argue it's the opposite, the game is a strong case of ‚Äúdopamine blue ball‚Äù for beginners.

As a new player, you can play many games in a row without a single kill or even know why your hero kept dying, why you target wasn‚Äôt taking damage, why your hero couldn‚Äôt even move in a team fight, etc. It can be overwhelmingly frustrating without someone explaining things to you as you are going through that.

It's kinda comical that for a video game, so many of the hero skills/items are designed to stop the other guy from *playing the game*, from perma CCs to escape/save skills to items that disarm your opponent. It's great when you are on the side dishing it out but it feels awful for the side taking it, which is the side new players tend to be on.

An important measurement for successful video game design is **can you have fun if you are new and terrible at the game**? There are some games that pull this off exceptionally well (Hell Diver 2 comes to mind), and with things like ""I am gonna go make a cup of coffee because the enemy Ogre started stunning me"", I would argue Dota 2 is the opposite of that. That first dopamine hit unfortunately never came for so many people who tried Dota.

I remember trying LoL a couple times and in the first game I got multiple kills and was able to do stuff in flashy team fights, despite not knowing what I was doing. Our team lost badly, but I remembered cool moments from the game where I got kills or ""did stuff"", so I gave it a few more tries.

Now I'm not saying LoL is the better game because I still vastly prefer Dota, but guess which one is better at attracting and retaining new players?

Do I have a solution for that? I don't think there are clean solutions to this tough problem, without compromising on what makes Dota great in the first place. Valve has been making some effort in reducing unnecessary complexity (while introducing others) but maybe limiting heroes and *items* for new players games and unlock more of them as you go will produce a less frustrating experience, while building a sense of progress as one get better. But again, that's by no means a perfect solution and has its own issues.

And some people will argue Dota should just remain Dota and attracting and retaining new players don't matter that much, and maybe that is a valid point too since the game still has a decent player base after 12 years, which is very good for the game industry overall.",0,1728071884.0,DotA2,0,0.5,False

This is another experience I wrote about that got lost in the r/girlfartstories subreddit that got removed. Imma just copy and paste it how I wrote it.

I want to preface this by saying, I am in no way shape or form endorsing abuse or advantage taking of people with disabilities.
This is a bit of a long one as I want to give you guys background and details so sorry in advance.
Description: Let‚Äôs call her Cassie. Cassie is an Indian girl with black curly hair that sat well on her shoulders, wide nose, beautiful brown eyes and puffy lips that hid her black beauty marks around her lips and she had a genuine quirky smile and laugh. She goes to the gym quite often as was evident by her chubby but very curvy figure, her thighs matched her body‚Äôs structure well. Cassie also wears a hearing aid around campus all the time but I don‚Äôt know all the details about her disability. Her hearing seems to not be completely affecting her studies as she‚Äôs able to be in the non-special care class that my college has for others with disabilities. She had her own special seat usually in my lectures as all the lecturers are made aware of her hearing.
Story: This happened last year summer. I applied to do a summer course in my college to catch up on some credits I was missing. All the classes were kept at night on campus, which I didn‚Äôt like because I‚Äôd much rather have classes in the morning so I can enjoy the rest of my day lol. Anyways, classes were going fine for a week or so then one day I enter class late due to oversleeping from my nap, everyone was starting at me, I looked like shit as I just threw on some clothes and ran out the door to head to class. I didn‚Äôt wanna interrupt the flow of class too much so I quickly just took a seat in the front row to settle in quickly. The row was empty besides myself and Cassie. Cassie was sitting 3 seats down from me. (To note: This wasn‚Äôt a very popular course so the class size wasn‚Äôt large, probably about 25 of us would be present usually.) About 10 mins into my note-taking I get a faint whiff of what smelt like rubber and burnt coffee? I look around the class subtly and notice no one seems to notice the smell so I assumed they were all ignoring it or the smell was just really concentrated where I was seated and it definitely wasn‚Äôt me. I hesitantly look over at Cassie who was wearing a beige tank top with grey sweatpants and a Starbucks coffee cup. Seeing the coffee cup got me excited at the thought that Cassie just cropdusted our row in the lecture room. I get up and move to sit right next to her and she seemed a little guilty and spooked as she blushed a little at me. Indeed the smell definitely got stronger as I sat next to her but it was dissipating now. I always saw her in my lectures but never felt the need to talk to her, I asked her about what I missed whilst I wasn‚Äôt here, she briefly informed me then grunted slightly. I asked if she was okay
‚ÄúNo not really, I‚Äôm having a bit of gas‚Äù as she laughed softly. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, it happens to the best of us, I actually smelt it from all the way over there. Smells just like the coffee you‚Äôve been drinking‚Äù.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, I need my coffee to make it through these nightly lectures but they mess me up bad. You should move before I blow again, I‚Äôm warning you‚Äù
‚ÄúFarts don‚Äôt bother me much at all, you‚Äôre good, plus better me than anyone else‚Äù I had to raise my voice a little because she wasn‚Äôt hearing me clearly which I‚Äôm okay with.
‚ÄúYour torture chamber I guess.‚Äù
Shortly after, a low 2 second grumble escaped her ass. ‚ÄúUgh that one stunk‚Äù she said. I got a faint whiff of it, smelt like a worse version of the first fart but she must‚Äôve really dug it deep into the cushions of the chair as it wasn‚Äôt very audible unless you were listening for it and the smell lasted like half a second. Fast forward, class ends and I offer to walk her back to her dorm room. I didn‚Äôt care for any more farts at the time I just wanted to make sure she got back to her dorm safe, she declined at first but I insisted as it‚Äôs not safe for a woman to walk back to her dorm room this late on campus, as we‚Äôve had horrible incidents before. She agreed after a while and as we‚Äôre walking we stop by some benches to sit and chat and get to know each other and we exchange numbers and Snapchats.
‚ÄúI have to rip one again‚Äù ‚ÄúGo on then.‚Äù
Cassie gets up and goes into an empty hallway to do her business. I peak around the corner and I see her pacing and fanning her ass quickly to get rid of the smell. I was immediately turned on but quite conflicted because I know people with disabilities are regular humans like us but it still felt morally wrong lol? So I tried to push those dirty thoughts away and carried her safely to her dorm. We became friends shortly after and studied together and passed our summer course. I confessed through text to Cassie that I enjoyed her farts on that day at the end of the summer classes and she laughed saying if she knew she would‚Äôve ripped more as she found me attractive which made it hard for her to talk or be around me

At a family gathering we were playing charades  and we all picked like roald  Dahl movies or Disney/pixar my mum got up infront of me and my kids who were sitting down started swinging her hips be grabbed her imaginary penis and kind of gyratedü•π. Finally my sister said the full Monty and my mum said no Willy wonka ü•π

2. She recently told me she had seen my aunty while she was in the way to a drs appointment and according to my mum my aunty walked with her and said oh I'll see the dr also. My mum proceeded to tell me that my aunty asked the dr or help her with menopause weight gain and flashed her boobs at him. I see my aunty today and she said she never went to the drs with my mum I believe her my mum is a compulsive liar. She kept repeating it I said I'm sure she has. Bra on and tried to end the topic. She does this a lot a lot. 

3.i met her for coffee with my sister and she  told me oh I I've written some short stories I might sell them on amazon. I said yeah good cos she been unemployed all her life so I'm happy she might be doing something to give her a bit more to do and purpose. She said to me you read it now while your sitting there(because she wants to see my reaction I do feel she liked the disgust that it causes me ) . And she sent me the s tories on WhatsApp I didn't read it really  cos I was out in. Cafe I wanted to drink and laugh and talk with my sister.  Only when I got home I sat down to have a look i found 5 short gore stories. And she has added images also that she found on Facebook and one was our friends profile photo.  I was crying and called my sister 
M my sister confronted her and my mum said your such a prude people want to buy this stuff it's a top seller I told her where are you planning to sell that cos it's not going on Amazon I know she won't ever sell it was just for me. 

3.when I went on my first date I did kiss him I was like 17 when I got home she beat me within an inch of my life and said I was a whore etc. she broke all my stuff like in my room. The beatings were not unusual but honestly she used to have sex all the  time in her room while I was in my room. 

4.once I went away for a few minutes in primark to look at something and I found my mum had bought my daughter underwear and it was very sexy even I don't wear red. Lacy thongs and it Certainly  wasn't appropriate for school. I stopped buying my kids underwear in about year 7 or 8 they would just send me a link and I would buy it the parcel would come to them and then they take their underwear to their rooms themslebes. I wanted to give them their privacy and create that barrier even from me a long time ago.  I was so mad when I found out she was underwear shopping with my child.  From then I haven't let the kids close to her. My kids have the most homework and coursework in the entire country (good excuse why she hasn't seen them ) 

5. finally if at any time we see talking if I see her she will start saying did you see xyz on tv. I will be like no even I don't watch tv at all so obviously I haven't see it. She will go on to describe a gore movie and In great detail. I will say no I don't want to hear like I said when I squeem I feel she likes it. Anyway I not the person who like gore even in my video games I like very gentle games like Mario Nintendo or non combat games. I love peace and peaceful things. Gore makes me sick and I know she must watch it a lot. And I don't think she has the outlet to have a partner anymore she is in her 60s. 


Ofc course there is more then this. And after the underwear incident the kids were not alone with her again. That's when the gore movies and gore WhatsApp stories have stared so I put up a lot of boundaries so I feel like she is trying to get around them  

I have no memory of her abusing me as a child by way of Sexual touching. If it happened I can't access that memory. Verbal abused mental and beaten with hammers  regularly yes. I remember 

She did say that her own father would regularly SA her and her sisters. This I also just found out.

I'm trying to protect my kids from JW indoctrination, mainly by interrupting their 'spiritual routine', and helping them develop their own critical thinking skills. 

My son is 13 and afaik, mentally out. He hardly attends any meetings but does go out in field service about once a month because, I think, he likes that one to one time with his mum, and they go for coffee afterwards. 

By helping him become mentally out, I realise that he is virtually living the life of a half-pimo. He has never-jdub school friends and has been to their birthday parties. But he also has a lot of JW friends (from whom he keeps secrets about the birthday parties), and a large extended JW family, including cousins he is close to. 

It's a lot to navigate. 

Anyhow, his JW friend in another congregation invited him to stay over and go on the ministry with his family on the Saturday morning. I'm confident that he is not indoctrinated, and I want him to find his own way to make it work. His friend's family are Uber pimi and he is homeschooled. 

My son got back from his sleepover and I asked him how it went. He said, ""Dad, we went on the ministry and we literally knocked at two doors who were both not at home, then we went for coffee.  It was ridiculous."" 

This experience did more to erode the credibility of the JW life for him than any lecture I could give him on 587bce or Mexico/Malawi. If a super JW family don't care about preaching the good news, why the hell should he? 

If it has this effect on my kid, I wonder how his friend feels. With this kind of upbringing, even if he stays JW, how likely is it that he will pioneer? 

I think pioneering is really important for the Borg. They need to be able to offer a credible career path for 16-year old to choose that will keep them out of college. 

From this example, the whole JW model is crumbling.",9,1728071189.0,exjw,4,1.0,False

## History

Some of you might remember my previous race report that I posted after running my first marathon, the Vermont City Marathon. This was a big deal for me, as it was almost exactly 7 years after being diagnosed with MS. I was an avid runner in HS, so getting back to running again has been incredible for my mental and physical well-being. I've learned a lot about being an athlete with MS over the last few years, some of which I've been trying to apply to my marathon training. Some days, my legs just don't want to work, particularly for speed work. In addition, I have to do things like planning my training around my infusions that I get every few months that completely wipe me out. I'm also immunocompromised from said infusions, so I have to be really mindful of if/when I'm getting sick and what I need to do to train through it (if I can).

## Training

After running VCM, I knew that I wanted to put some of my newly-found fitness into practice before starting to train for Berlin. I had signed up for the Boston 10K late June, followed by a local 5K a week or so later. After the marathon, I took off about a week and then jumped into speed work. I mostly focused on intervals and hill workouts, trying to build back up a little bit of fitness after some time off and then race the BAA 10K. My main goal was to go sub-40, which I had never done before (admittedly, I had never run a 10K before either). I knew I was in shape to do it, but was still relatively new on racing at this point. Right as we were lining up for the race it started torrentially downpouring, which unfortunately made the course extremely wet and slippery. In the end, I finished in 39:35, which I was pretty happy with, and was looking forward to going top-3 in the local 5K coming up in a few more weeks.

As I prepared for the 5K, I knew that I wanted to incorporate a lot more strength training into this build. Unfortunately, it seemed like I was starting to develop Runner's Knee on my right side and some hamstring tendinopathy on my left. This came to a head early July, after trying to do a few runs through mild discomfort, causing both of them to flair up and completely parking my training for about two weeks. Sadly, I missed my 5K but knew that I had to keep my eyes on the bigger picture - a new PR in Berlin.

Mid-July I was able to start getting some better training in. Because of the injury, I was already a bit behind and jumped into the Pfitz 12/55 plan and tried to regain some of my lost fitness as safely as I could. The hamstring was better, but unfortunately the Runner's Knee continued to plague me for the entirety of the build. I'm not going to have to figure out what to do about it, but fortunately with some strength training, taping, and minimizing sitting with bent knees I was able to still run fairly well. I averaged 55mpw for the rest of July, and then I was feeling good so I adapted the plan to a hybrid 12/55-65 mpw plan. Starting in August, I hit 55, 62, 63, 62, 55 mpw and then started my taper. About 2-3 weeks out from the marathon, I was feeling in pretty good fitness. I ran a solo 5K ""tune-up"" in 18:30, intending to run a 10K but calling it short because of the weather, followed by a progressive 16 at about a 7:00 pace the next day. I was feeling great as I approached two weeks out from the marathon, but then my left hamstring started to flare up again, so I took it a bit easier and only did 30 miles two weeks out into the taper. The last week, the week of the race, I only ran 16, opting to rest more given my sore hamstring and all the walking I was doing traveling in Berlin.

## Pre-Race

We arrived in Berlin Thursday morning after flying in from Boston, planning to adapt to the time change and do some sightseeing for a few days before taking the train to Northern Germany and visit my wife's family for the rest of the trip after the race. I knew going into this that the jet lag and the sight seeing would be stressful, and they were, but I also didn't want to miss an opportunity to see such a cool city. It is what it is, and it is a sacrifice that I was willing to make. I started carb loading about 3 days out, aiming for 300g carbs on Thursday, followed by 500g on Friday and Saturday. Carb loading is pretty easy in Germany, as their bakeries are amazing, but I did find it a bit difficult to find things like powerade and gatorade, so I stuck to mostly orange juice for liquid carbs. On Saturday, we did a lot of walking and my legs were really feeling it so we called it an early night and I tried to get some sleep before the race on Sunday. I woke up at 5:30am, ate some bananas and bread, drank a coffee, then caught the U-bahn to the S-bahn and got off at Hauptbahnhof and walked towards the starting area. I knew immediately upon arrival it was going to be a shitshow - lines everywhere, almost impossible to find a bathroom, and I was glad that I chose to arrive about 75 minutes early so I could wait in line, use the bathroom, and drop off my bag. After doing that, I followed the mass of people towards the start line where I tried to get a spot at the front of Corral D...ultimately not a great spot to be but more on that later.

## Race

This is the first major I had ever run, and I knew that it was going to be absolutely packed. Even still, I wasn't quite prepared for the sheer number of people lined up around me. By the time we finally got going and the start was called, it took us another 20+ minutes to go from the front of the corral to the actual start line. My plan was to try and go out around a 7:15 pace and hold that for the first half, while weaving as little as possible, but that was almost impossible. My first few miles were completely boxed in, constantly having my stride cut short by people cutting around, trying to find a lane to move up. I was going way too slow, and there were tons of people barely jogging or already even walking at this point. How did they make it into Corral D of Wave 1? I have no idea, but it was a bit frustrating.

After the first few km, things started to open up a little. I was still finding that for my goal time I was constantly passing people and weaving through crowds, but that's all I could do and I was resigned to it. My legs were feeling great, and I focused on enjoying the crowds and the scenery as I got to the half way point in 1:36 and change. Finally things started picking up a bit and I was able to get some more room, so I focused on dropping my average pace a second at a time, aiming for that 7:15 overall pace and at least solidly achieve my B goal.

As we started approaching the 20 mile mark, I could feel my legs really starting to pick-up and settle into a pace. Unfortunately, my left achilles was starting to get uncomfortable, something I hadn't really ever had happen before. I wasn't sure if I had rolled my ankle slightly weaving through people (I had to dodge someone pretty hard around mile 18) or if it was just fatiguing from over-use, but it was definitely getting painful. Still, my HR was good and I was feeling strong while I hit the 32km mark and started through Ku'damm. I decided to pick up the pace and push it to the end, and was just praying every footfall that my achilles wouldn't give out on me. Through this last 10K I averaged a sub-7:00 pace, which felt great, knowing that if I could keep this up I would sneak in under 3:10 and maybe even be able to push for my 3:07 goal. My left leg was agony, but every turn was taking me closer and closer to the gate. Finally, after one last turn there it was...I admit I got fairly emotional. I had really put in a lot of work training for this run, and it felt like a huge battle to make it this far despite my MS. I knew that I could run marathons after VCM, but this felt like the first race where things started falling into place and I was really proud of what I was accomplishing.

I made it across the finish line and looked at my watch, 3:08:10, just barely off my A goal. My 2nd half was a 1:31:xx, which is also a PR for me and I negative split by 5 minutes (not my intention). I admit I'm still a bit disappointed, but I was happy for what I had achieved to get even to that stage. I know that I left many minutes on the course with the crowds and the weaving, so I'm feeling pretty confident of further dropping my time in the future. Still, this represented a PR of 18 minutes over VCM, which I was pretty happy with.


## Confirmation of Acceptance ‚Äì 129th Boston Marathon

So technically, MS is a qualifying disability for Boston and all you have to do is a complete a marathon during the qualifying window. I know that I didn't quite hit a BQ for my age group, but I decided I want to run it anyways because I don't know how long I'll actually be able to run for. Some people may find this sacrosanct, but I'm ok with that. Some day I'd like to have a more ""legit"" qualifying time, but for now I'm happy just to be able to run and to have an opportunity to participate in such a notable event. I live in Boston, so that further added to my desire to want to run this race.

For now, I can barely walk... I seem to have really messed up my achilles/ankle, which I'm hoping I can recover in the next few weeks as I'm signed up for the Boston Half-Marathon middle of November; I'd like to go sub-1:30, maybe even 1:27 or so, but we'll see how the recovery is. I finally got home last night after traveling for 19 hours and immediately tested positive for COVID, too (first time!), so that adds a bit more to the recovery time.

Hello again folks! Your resident performance obsessed Redditor here, with my updated Pagespeed guide! It's gone through significant revisions since the last time I posted it. It has grown another 60 pages, up from 308 to over 368+ (and growing!) pages of content. It's officially hit full on novel length!

Major content additions, expansions on everything that was previously in the guide, significantly better and more logical organization, revamped table of contents, grammar and spelling fixes, many new optimization strategies and much needed additional specificity.

**[Don‚Äôt forget to check the table of contents, it is not expanded by default! The icon is on the top left side on desktop](https://imgur.com/a/GjsPhfo)**

Included is a breakdown on how to analyze and interpret Speed Test reports to identify optimization opportunities.

There's an extensive amount of optimization information and resources for server stack configuration for NGINX, Apache, OpenLiteSpeed, Varnish, Object Caching, PHP, HAProxy, MySQL, SSL, Gzip/Brotli, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the Google Pagespeed module, Security considerations effects on performance and Linux optimizations. There are also a bunch of resources on database optimization.

Wordpress specific optimizations: It now has sections on how to optimize common features including Ads, Forms, Woocommerce, Analytics, Google Maps, Fonts, Custom Fields, Galleries, Video Players, Sliders, Filters, SEO plugins, Anti-Spam, Cookie Notices, Backup plugins; in addition to one size fits all optimizations(Images, Videos, CDN, SSL, CSS, JS, Resource Hints, Caching etc), and tons and tons more.

Every optimization opportunity has a free plugin option (or multiple) listed. Some paid plugins are included as I find them very useful(Perfmatters and Asset Cleanup Pro for example). However I've included alternatives for all paid options. Every single thing in my guide can be implemented for free. 

I've done my best to cover all of the bases you‚Äôd find in any page speed guide, in addition to a focus on adding uncommon optimization strategies and solutions that you won‚Äôt find in any off the shelf guide. This is a compilation of all of my research over the last 6 years delving into performance optimization.

I'm confident that if you follow every single step in the guide, almost any site you maintain can score 90+ on a Pagespeed Insights Mobile Speed Test. 

If you notice anything missing from my performance guide that you think I should add, or if there is some information you believe needs to be amended (or expanded on), please let me know in the comments and I'll be sure to add a section or revise the content on the topic (if necessary) as soon as possible!

If you feel that the guide is too overwhelming and you'd prefer to have someone else optimize your site‚Äôs performance or need a consultation, feel free to DM me.

If anyone wants to be able to import a large set of free optimization plugins (and you can selectively choose which ones to download/install), download WP Favs. I do need to update the collection since I've added tons to the guide since the last time I posted this, but it's still comprehensive:

https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpfavs/

The code to import them is: JAuOGP5BZICR5LmBsPANN9kpKHfiie

https://imgur.com/a/nU1v5CU

The most recent additions to the guide have been: A much expanded section at the top on how to read and interpret page speed reports, an inferences section on how to read waterfall charts for information not explicitly reported in Pagespeed reports with a case study on a page on ThemeIsle's website, more expansion on misconceptions, much more information on various types of server caching and various components of server stack optimization, and so much more.

About 2-3 weeks out from the marathon, I was feeling in pretty good fitness. I ran a solo 5K ""tune-up"" in 18:30, intending to run a 10K but calling it short because of the weather, followed by a progressive 16 at about a 7:00 pace the next day. I was feeling great as I approached two weeks out from the marathon, but then my left hamstring started to flare up again, so I took it a bit easier and only did 30 miles two weeks out into the taper. The last week, the week of the race, I only ran 16, opting to rest more given my sore hamstring and all the walking I was doing traveling in Berlin.

## Pre-Race

We arrived in Berlin Thursday morning after flying in from Boston, planning to adapt to the time change and do some sightseeing for a few days before taking the train to Northern Germany and visit my wife's family for the rest of the trip after the race. I knew going into this that the jet lag and the sight seeing would be stressful, and they were, but I also didn't want to miss an opportunity to see such a cool city. It is what it is, and it is a sacrifice that I was willing to make. I started carb loading about 3 days out, aiming for 300g carbs on Thursday, followed by 500g on Friday and Saturday. Carb loading is pretty easy in Germany, as their bakeries are amazing, but I did find it a bit difficult to find things like powerade and gatorade, so I stuck to mostly orange juice for liquid carbs. On Saturday, we did a lot of walking and my legs were really feeling it so we called it an early night and I tried to get some sleep before the race on Sunday. I woke up at 5:30am, ate some bananas and bread, drank a coffee, then caught the U-bahn to the S-bahn and got off at Hauptbahnhof and walked towards the starting area. I knew immediately upon arrival it was going to be a shitshow - lines everywhere, almost impossible to find a bathroom, and I was glad that I chose to arrive about 75 minutes early so I could wait in line, use the bathroom, and drop off my bag. After doing that, I followed the mass of people towards the start line where I tried to get a spot at the front of Corral D...ultimately not a great spot to be but more on that later.

## Race

This is the first major I had ever run, and I knew that it was going to be absolutely packed. Even still, I wasn't quite prepared for the sheer number of people lined up around me. By the time we finally got going and the start was called, it took us another 20+ minutes to go from the front of the corral to the actual start line. My plan was to try and go out around a 7:15 pace and hold that for the first half, while weaving as little as possible, but that was almost impossible. My first few miles were completely boxed in, constantly having my stride cut short by people cutting around, trying to find a lane to move up. I was going way too slow, and there were tons of people barely jogging or already even walking at this point. How did they make it into Corral D of Wave 1? I have no idea, but it was a bit frustrating.

After the first few km, things started to open up a little. I was still finding that for my goal time I was constantly passing people and weaving through crowds, but that's all I could do and I was resigned to it. My legs were feeling great, and I focused on enjoying the crowds and the scenery as I got to the half way point in 1:36 and change. Finally things started picking up a bit and I was able to get some more room, so I focused on dropping my average pace a second at a time, aiming for that 7:15 overall pace and at least solidly achieve my B goal.

As we started approaching the 20 mile mark, I could feel my legs really starting to pick-up and settle into a pace. Unfortunately, my left achilles was starting to get uncomfortable, something I hadn't really ever had happen before. I wasn't sure if I had rolled my ankle slightly weaving through people (I had to dodge someone pretty hard around mile 18) or if it was just fatiguing from over-use, but it was definitely getting painful. Still, my HR was good and I was feeling strong while I hit the 32km mark and started through Ku'damm. I decided to pick up the pace and push it to the end, and was just praying every footfall that my achilles wouldn't give out on me. Through this last 10K I averaged a sub-7:00 pace, which felt great, knowing that if I could keep this up I would sneak in under 3:10 and maybe even be able to push for my 3:07 goal. My left leg was agony, but every turn was taking me closer and closer to the gate. Finally, after one last turn there it was...I admit I got fairly emotional. I had really put in a lot of work training for this run, and it felt like a huge battle to make it this far despite my MS. I knew that I could run marathons after VCM, but this felt like the first race where things started falling into place and I was really proud of what I was accomplishing.

I made it across the finish line and looked at my watch, 3:08:10, just barely off my A goal. My 2nd half was a 1:31:xx, which is also a PR for me and I negative split by 5 minutes (not my intention). I admit I'm still a bit disappointed, but I was happy for what I had achieved to get even to that stage. I know that I left many minutes on the course with the crowds and the weaving, so I'm feeling pretty confident of further dropping my time in the future. Still, this represented a PR of 18 minutes over VCM, which I was pretty happy with.


## Confirmation of Acceptance ‚Äì 129th Boston Marathon

So technically, MS is a qualifying disability for Boston and all you have to do is a complete a marathon during the qualifying window. I know that I didn't quite hit a BQ for my age group, but I decided I want to run it anyways because I don't know how long I'll actually be able to run for. Some people may find this sacrosanct, but I'm ok with that. Some day I'd like to have a more ""legit"" qualifying time, but for now I'm happy just to be able to run and to have an opportunity to participate in such a notable event. I live in Boston, so that further added to my desire to want to run this race.

For now, I can barely walk... I seem to have really messed up my achilles/ankle, which I'm hoping I can recover in the next few weeks as I'm signed up for the Boston Half-Marathon middle of November; I'd like to go sub-1:30, maybe even 1:27 or so, but we'll see how the recovery is. I finally got home last night after traveling for 19 hours and immediately tested positive for COVID, too (first time!), so that adds a bit more to the recovery time.

As we walked, I tried to make small talk with him so the trip wouldn't be awkward and silent. I asked him about his program, what year he's in, and where he's from, to name a few topics. What I found was I would ask him something or say something and he would reply in a way that almost baited me into saying something offensive, for example, I asked what his first language was since he brought up that English was a difficult language for him to learn. He insisted I guess and got offended when I got it wrong because I was somehow stereotyping him based off the language I guessed. He also asked me to come home with him ten minutes into talking to him and asked me to meet him again, saying something along the lines of ""were going to talk again right? like go to coffee or in the dorms?"" as I was trying to leave. Ive ran into him a few times since then and I've found the conversations he's made me have slightly uncomfortable as well but I'm unsure if I'm reading too far into it.

Since I‚Äôm not drinking I also started using them when I‚Äôd go to socialise.

1fw7i6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1fw7i6e/routine_help/,[routine help],"Hi, Im 20f. In my country we have harsh winters and the preferred drink of choice is tea (chai). Last winters i had one too many cups but i had no issues up until January this year when I noticed my lips slowly turned dull and suddenly started turning black, first around the corners and then then the center too. They were rough to the touch, chapped, dry and constantly peeling and absolutely nothing helped until I saw a doctor for it and got prescribed a eczema cream. I didn‚Äôt chalk it up to the culprit being chai until my lips healed and I had a cup again and boom a few hours later they had a rough blackish cast. I cut out black tea completely and then I had a cup of coffee, again the same symptoms. 

So now I know its not seasonal due to winters like the doctors said but rather black tea and coffee. Is it possible to have developed a tannin allergy? Or an allergy to something else causing this? I am a college student so it‚Äôs not possible to cut out tea and coffee entirely.

I am 40 days on lexapro. 30 days on 5 mg. I wasn't really anxious before starting but was more ahedonic and depressed because of that. 
The side effects that i have are fatigue, irrability from time to time,concentration problems and lazyness because it takes away my motivation and my sleep is somehow worse because i dream and feel like not fully rested after sleeping. 
Has anyone experienced this? Because the fatigue and lazyness and apathy on it makes me actually depressed as well. I just exchanged the ahedonia where i had motivation to do things with being lazy and unmotivated fatigued monster. I did have periods of time where during days i would feel happier but I can't say that i had full days being good and since this fatigue and apathy aren't going away after 30 days on 5mg should I go down on 2.5? Because I can't imagine to increase to feel even more unmotivated and more fatigued or this all isn't dose dependent?
I started drinking coffee for concentration and fatigue and it helps abit. However I am not satisfied with this side effects. Do they get better or I gave it enough time? ",1,1728069701.0,lexapro,0,1.0,False

Do you or the person you know also have Diabetes? I found an article that is interesting regarding what is known as T3cDM. It certain parts, it makes sense that EPI would stem or cause blood glucose regulation. It became apparent in my case that this might be true. The physicians would take my blood for routine follow up and my blood glucose levels were routinely at 85 mg/dl. Slowly over the last year of check ups, I‚Äôve notice my fasting glucose getting closer to 95 mg/dl. Long story short, I decided to monitor my glucose with a traditional tracker and then with a CGM. Well, I‚Äôm staying closer to an average of 122 mg/dl and routinely have readings in the 140mg/dl with fasting glucose readings as high as 130 mg/dl. I eat a high protein low carb diet, no sugars or sweets outside of the occasional blueberries or slice of sourdough bread. No processed foods or sugary drinks. Only water and coffee. My A1c is normal and when tested fasting glucose flies under the radar. 

All this to say, please check out the article linked and please don‚Äôt discount your blood glucose with this disease.

A few days ago I bought myself a Breville Oracle (not the touch). I‚Äôd been saving for some kind of Italian machine but here in NZ, they will set me back a lot of money (I got this machine on a great deal so it was in budget) and I have a baby coming in a couple of months so coffee will be a necessity. Up until now I‚Äôve just used a French press with a Bodum grinder so definitely nothing flash. I drink a flat white when I‚Äôm out. 

I have searched for answers to my question but I‚Äôm finding it a bit technical to understand so I need some help in extreme newbie terms. The beginners guide seemed to be mostly for a manual machine so I wasn‚Äôt sure how to apply it to my machine. I know I have an automatic machine and that my coffee might not be perfect but right now it‚Äôs bitter and (I think) overextracted. 

I‚Äôve tried reducing the grind size and the shot duration (down to 26 secs) but that made it worse. Shot duration only seemed to almost completely fill my 170ml cup. I‚Äôm using the 2 cup basket on the 1 cup setting because I do like a strong coffee but not a bitter one!

Beans are Supreme, a strong roast, roasted sometime in September and kept airtight since then. 

Is my next step:
A) try the 1 cup basket
B) attempt to fiddle with the shot volume settings
C) change the grind - how?
D) something else?

Appreciate the total newbie help. Bit worried I‚Äôve made a mistake with this machine!",1,1728069610.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

We have traveled and spent at least 40 full days together this year and recently she had started to stay with me once a week.

  
Just last week, we were on the east coast at a dinner with a friend of hers and she was so proud to say that we were exclusive. Everything was perfect. We usually text every day and send each other memes, etc.

I had to leave Friday for work and she decided to go to the UK by herself. She recently had a minor episode where she totally flaked on me when we were supposed to meet and didn't communicate. She profusely apologized the next day and said she would do better. She mentioned that she was feeling depressed from seeing her family and that she was 'trying not to end her life'. I wasn't sure how to take it at the time and she told me that she  didn't want advice or feedback.

The following Sunday, she missed her first flight to the east coast and then the second one. But I had reservations planned at a nice restaurant and had to scramble to not only cancel, but to rebook for the next day. She ended up arriving late and I ended up sleeping at 2am even though I like to sleep early.

I just had a gut feeling that something was off so I was fearing that if she went to the UK by herself, she would fall into a deeper depression. It's gloomy and cold right now. Not ideal for someone facing a deeper depression.

That weekend, communication patterns changed. She messaged me a goodnight and said she was thinking of me but that was about it. It went from texting/meme'ing every day to just a goodnight and then no contact on Sunday.

Monday she gets back and asks to hang on Tuesday. I ask if everything is okay and she says yes. But I know something is wrong. She just won't talk about it. I figured that I'd just wait until she shows up on Tuesday so we can talk about it and also for me to be candid about how I need her to be a better communicator.

  
Tuesday comes. No contact. I text. Nothing. I call. Nothing.

By Wednesday, I know at the bottom of my heart that she's fully in it. I can feel it (despite not ever having dealt with this before).

  
I simply text her that I know what she's going through must be tough and that I'm there for her. 

No response.

Thursday, I decide to pull out all the stops. I text her that I'm dropping by to drop off a few goodies and when I arrive, she texts me to just leave it outside.

This is her first response/contact with me in 3 days.

I'm completely crushed.

I tell her that I'm going to work at the coffee shop nearby to give her a longer window and that I'd really like to see her and that honestly I feel saddened by her cold message to me.  

No response

I end up buying lunch for her and leaving it outside and telling her that I think she is brave and I will be there for her.

Her response is she doesn't feel like talking. 'Take care Aaron'.

I have a few questions here:

- Does it seem like she's breaking up with me here with those 3 words?

- I know the best thing I can do is to NOT provide advice/feedback and just sprinkle in affirmations that I'm there for her occasionally, but this is such a drastic change from daily texts. How should I approach communication now?

- We had international travel planned in the next 6 weeks to two locations, should I assume those are both dead?

- How long does it take to recover from this? if at all?",2,1728069301.0,depression,4,1.0,False

TL:DR: My wife has consistently lied in the past and I have found disturbing (to me) evidence that she may be cheating.

I've (37m) never really posted before and my heart is racing while I'm typing this. Probably because I've been drinking too much coffee, but I'm honestly not sure what to do.

As the title states, I'm nearly positive that my wife (38f) has slept with someone else. I could be jumping to conclusions, as I do suffer from mental health issues, (cptsd, panic disorder, autism spectrum at 35) but they're fairly well controlled these days. 

I suppose that I should just start from the beginning of when my suspicions started. 

We've never been a jealous couple and had always laughed it off when other people would try to flirt with us. I always felt very secure with her, because we had tons in common, and I've always been told that I'm a fairly attractive guy. Most women would tell my wife that I was a ""catch"". I've always adored my wife, and anyone that would meet her, would always tell her about how I wouldn't shut up about how happy I was with her. We've now been together for 22 years and we're getting ready to celebrate 14 years together married.

When I was 30, I ended up having a stroke, that caused me to have a number of neurological issues. Before the stroke, I worked way too much, and  was always at the gym. I was the pinnacle of health for a male at my age when this happened. Once it happened, I was unable to drive, and was left alone at my house for 3+ months while I recovered. We moved for work, so we didn't have anyone to keep an eye on me. I thought she would be there to take care of me. Instead, she suddenly wouldn't come home until 8 at night, sometimes later. She would always come home, take a shower, and wouldn't want to be bothered. She would grocery shop and say ""here's your food for the week"". I forgave it, because I knew how hard this must have been on her. The guy she knew before had effectively died after the stroke.

One day, I needed to use her phone to message someone, as it was conveniently on the bed. She said that was fine, but rushed in to tell me not to open some messages that were from another guy. When I asked why, she stated that he was a ""creep"" from work that was trying to hook up with her. That she wanted him to take the hint and leave his messages as unread. Before, she was talking about how interesting this guy was, and how he was covered in tattoos. She has always been into musicians and ""metal"" guys. I used to be one myself, before the corporate life got a hold of me. I trusted what she was saying and left it alone.

Fast forward a little bit, I'm starting to have less ""quirks"" from the stroke, and I'm able to start going out in public. My day trip was to the local Walmart to help me acclimate to the outside world again. While there, we're walking through the vitamins section, and she says suddenly ""we should buy some condoms"". I ask her why, because we haven't used them since our early 20's. She stated, ""I miss the way they feel. I've been thinking about how good they feel."" We hadn't had sex since my stroke because I had issues with involuntary spasms. Like an idiot, I said ""Ok, if that's what you want. I'd love to get back to where we were before and this would be a great test for me."" Surprise, we didn't have sex. A few weeks later, I'm determined to make her happy, so I go to her closet to find them (In hindsight, why did she keep them with her stuff?). It was a three pack, and I noticed the box was opened. Inside the box, there were two condoms. My heart sank, but I told myself there was a logical reason for it, and that she probably put it on one of her toys. I'm a guy, who loves his wife, so I'm obviously stupid. Later that night, we have sex. Afterwards, I ask her very casually about it, and asked if she had a good time with it. It was completely out of character for her, she started screaming at me. Saying that I invaded her privacy. She then stomps to her closet and started throwing everything out of it. Tears the place apart and comes back up to me saying ""maybe you used it!? How about that!? You're home all the time, maybe you're fucking someone!? Did you ever think about that before accusing me of cheating on you!?"" I never even stated that and I tried to calm her down. I finally said (again, I'm stupid) ""Look, if you slept with someone else, I understand. I haven't been well and you probably needed to find someone to meet your needs"". She then got back into bed and pretended to go to sleep.

I snuck her phone away and opened the messages that she had asked me not to open. The messages never indicated they were having sex, but they were very flirty. Pictures back and forth, some of her wearing a band tee. I left it alone for 3 years.

Fast forward three years. I find an old box of phones of ours while doing some house cleaning. I plug them up to look at old pictures. On hers, I find great memories, but then find screenshots of texts. It's of a guy shirtless sent to her. I'm livid at this point, because I've given her so much grace to come clean. I send the pictures to me. When she gets home, I confront her with the pictures. A completely different situation this time. ""Honey, this is your mental illness, you make things up in your head. You create scenarios that aren't true."" This pisses me off even more, because I have full clarity, and therapy had cleared me from most of my residual issues from the stroke. I scream at her to not lie to me. She tells me the pictures are from a ""meme"" that she thought was funny. I asked her where the joke was. She starts crying and says that she hasn't been honest in the past, but she doesn't lie to me anymore. That she believes in an honest relationship. (For reference, she created a fake account years ago to see if I would cheat on her and if I were gay. I never did engage and ended up finding out it was her when she forgot to change the location and it was in our house. Crazy shit. This was the first big lie.) I tell her if I catch her lying again, I'm divorcing her. She agrees not to lie to me again.

Over the years, I catch her small lies all the time, but whatever. I love her and I don't want to divorce her for silly exaggerations of the truth. Every time I catch her, she cries, fights, and then love bombs me. She also never wants sex unless she gets caught. Then she becomes a sex goddess suddenly. Again, I am a man, and we're very stupid.

Fast forward to now. We went a majority of 2023 with no sex. In 2024, she has been sex crazy lately, and has been doing things she's never done before. Moves that she couldn't possibly know. She's always out of town for work and on one occasion I traveled with her because I was one of her clients. While at the hotel, she said she was obligated to spend time with clients, and to drink with them. I ended up getting the flu while there and she was my escort to a baseball game. I would wake up from a fever and she wouldn't be there. I called her boss, whom I good friends with, and he had no idea where she could be. When he called her he said ""I don't know what you're doing, but your husband is your #1 client, and he's very ill right now. Stop what you're doing, go to him, and make sure he gets to the game tonight."" The whole time, she bitches me out about keeping her from more important matters, and that everyone is asking her where she's at. When we get to the game, she leaves me in the stadium to go take selfies with other people. She comes back drunk off her ass at the last half. To beat all, she doesn't understand why I'm pissed. During the game, she points out a guy who wants her to sleep with him and do coke with her. She then goes on about how she never would. I brush it off and just say ""I really don't give a shit, do whatever you want. I'm running a 102 fever."" The whole time, her boss keeps coming over to check up on me and ask where she's at. The whole time back, she's going on about how in love she is with me, and about how ""masculine"" I am. Lol

Down the road, she tells me that her and I have been invited to ""swinger"" parties. I show my disgust and then she plays along as if she's mortified about the prospect of it. I'm not knocking, but I'm very monogamous.

She's now writing a novel and asked me to design a cover for it, but doesn't want me reading it. I ask what it's about and she tells me. I design the artwork for it and she tells me her discord friends ""hated it"" and how it didn't represent the story she was telling. How is this relevant? Hold on. She always keeps her laptop and phone in front of her and is constantly on calls. 

Last week, I was talking with her, and realized she wasn't listening at all. I started saying crazy nonsensical things and she didn't even acknowledge it. I finally yell her name and she looks up pissed. I ask her if was even listening and she was honest about it. ""Probably nothing I'm interested in hearing"". I say, ok. I go silent. Later on, she tries to straddle me, and starts to love bomb me. I gently move her away from me and tell her I'm not interested. She acts hurt about it, but goes to sit down. The love bombing keeps going for two days, wanting to buy me gifts (which she never does), and smother me in kisses. I don't play into it.

I wake up on Tuesday, my gut is telling me something is up. I swore against ever doing it again, but I open her laptop, and hop on her discord. I find a string of messages to her friends where she's in Nashville for a recent business trip and was meeting Garth Brooks (gross, I know). When she messaged me that night, she said she wasn't having a good time, so she went back to her hotel room. Said she had one drink and called it a night. Turns out, she was absolutely plastered, and sending pictures of random guys to her friends. Talking about how ""fucked up"" she was and how she didn't know how ""she was going to control herself around all these hot guys while I'm so fucking drunk"". She was also sending messages of all these online guys she thought were ""so hot and how she wished they didn't live so far away"". Most of these guys are practically nude, while she gushes over their bulges. How she wants to run her tongue over their bodies.

On top of that, again not judging, I found copious amounts of gay porn. She told me many years ago, that she didn't like the idea of me looking at porn, and lusting for other women. I broke myself of it out of respect for her. Turns out, the novel she is writing is gay erotica, and I find very graphic excerpts from the novel. This is why she didn't want me to read it and why her friends felt like my cover art wasn't relevant to the story. I find artwork of her characters engaged in extremely sexual acts. She knew that I wouldn't want my name attached to a sex book. I'm definitely not a prude, but I do have a certain level of integrity.

I know this was long, but I'm not mad. I'm honestly just heart broken and sick with grief. I legitimately thought I was dying when I found this and had a full on panic attack.

Since I've typed this, I realized how fucking stupid I am, and I should feel validated. Feel free to roast me. I'm considered a ""tough, intelligent, leader"" type by my peers. However, I'm honestly scared, and I'm extremely sensitive in real life.

Day 3/4 were pretty brutal with headaches and brain fog and I came very close to walking on over to the corner store and grabbing a nice can of 3mg gum pillows.

BUT I didn‚Äôt and I think I have gotten over a hump here. That‚Äôs not to say I am not craving any at the moment but I don‚Äôt feel like ass right now. 

I‚Äôm happy to reach this point and proud but still have the thoughts of.. I hope this I worth it.

Pros: feel less dehydrated, somewhat less yippity anxiety, although tired my energy is much more consistent throughout the day, excited to uncover more pros in this new phase of life.

Cons: a bit ‚Äúbored‚Äù, missing the high point of say a zyn and coffee to start the morning, or one to break up the work day and dig in a bit.

Hoping the clarity continues to hit me as the days continue!

(Also posted in dating advice) 27m 23f,"Hey all!! This is my first ever post to the masses, just looking for some info really to help myself mull it all over. Also think it's funny I'm in this Reddit considering I'm not in one and that's kind of the issue üòÇ

Long Version: (TLDR below) 

So, I'm a single guy travelling, and ended up staying in another country for way longer than I anticipated. I went with an ex girlfriend of mine and we ended up splitting over different lifestyles and goals in life (I wanted to stay and travel, she didn't) we talked about it loads and that was just the natural conclusion. 4 months later! I'm single and ready to mingle, and I see an absolute bombshell. Who, I approach and ask out. To my delight she says yes! And although texting is suggesting pretty much no interest, after bumping into each other randomly one day we end up hanging out all evening. This leads to a couple of dates that range from beach sunset picnic cuddles and climbing walls with a big group of friends to private campfires with wine and...ya know. The intimacy straight off the bat was INSANE!!! We got on like a house on fire, our interests are all the same, politics, travel aspirations, and I feel like we're at the same stage in life although I'm 27 and she's 23. I've just finished grinding in work and am ready to travel while she is in her travel phase. She's spent time in the country I grew up in, her interests and volunteering is what I studied at university! And Aside from that the attraction, morals, general chat and communication is all awesome

On the first date (alone, had one with friends first) she mentions travelling to Europe in a few months. Cool! I'm going too (for work and family) she actually suggests that the stars are aligned and she'll come to see me there! Ended up basically making out and talking about sex and what we liked and etc etc great evening. Wow what a fairytale. 

Second date, AMAAAZING, beach swim, slackening, cuddles in a hammock and kissing in front of a sunset, from 9am to 9pm. The whole time we talk about how much we feel this is crazy but also feels right! I was stroking her hair and gave a few cheek kisses, and I got a few back. Neither of us have been so comfortable so fast. She even describes me as perfect. I should pop by her work the next day as I drive past (as I was already). 

So I drive past and somethings up, she's stressed, I ask why, ""nothing!""
Then we sit down and it comes up... I'm going travelling and I want to be single. To be honest this did suck, but it's a total green flag, she was already opening up to
Communicate about it and said she really wanted to get the record straight before anymore happened. I was obviously a bit unprepared for this and sad given the last few dates and weeks of messaging and how much I liked her but, it's a fair thing to hear. Who wants to be tied down by someone you just met after planning a Europe trip for a few months. 

I took the day to thinks about it and I am an emotional person so I was really confid and upset (still values for her to say)

We decided later on in the evening that we would just be ""BEEEEST FRIENDS"" after a long concert where both of us basically said, dunno what to do about this it kinda blows. 


Anyway fast track - next date is a day at mine and we end up having coffee with a view at a Roman villa, picnicking with her friend and then cuddling in a hammock all afternoon and napping. Now I slipped up here on the ""casual"" and was still being very intimate, and while cuddling in the hammock half asleep I said I felt lucky. And she said she felt lucky. ""SHIIIIIIIT"" 
Anyway the sunset came and her friend wanted to go so they left. A text came in later saying how spending time with me was like living in some kind of dream and that she can't wait to just sleep next to me. We had our first proper text convo ""F******K""

4th and finally she came for dinner at mine, my housemates and I had a fire, we drank wine and then we headed to bed.....AMAAAAZZZIIINNNGGGGG, not just because we'd already talked about it, had loads of lent up desire from dating and were on the same page physically, just, the connection. While looking into each others eyes she said Tom....I really like you. 

Next day we had a lazy wake up and I made her breakfast before we headed to a viewpoint. Where she said she wanted to talk about something..... 
I still want to be single.... this was not on my mind at all but led to a 4 hour long conversation where the jist was, I want to be casual and then go travelling, I'm not coming to see you in Europe and I might not come back, WOAH. I (perhaps sillily on paper) said I had enough feelings now that the idea of not being exclusive before she went was ahit and just made me anxious. She said that she didn't want to see anyone else, she'd even declined to give her number to someone because she ""had a boyfriend"" but exclusivity no matter how you look at it is a type of relationship, and that is not what she wants. Bummer. 

I said I'd decide on it and we tried our best to forget the conversation for the rest of the evening. Had fun playing board games laughing (both of us couldn't shift the fact that we felt weird and sad however) we cuddled and hugged and kissed at another viewpoint before heading home. She invited me to come climbing but I was so drained from the conversation (and crying in front of her lol) that I said I'd stay. 

A day later I sent a text saying that I couldn't do it. I was too invested and liked her too much a. It was just going to be shit. But the reason I liked her was just seeing her and being near her! So I couldn't do that and we cut ties. I then saw her a few times in person given we have the same hobbies and it basically just ended up being us hanging out anyway. During one such hang out she said it was really hard not seeing me and that she wished we could still. I went in to her work the next day and said I thought it was all stupid and agreed, two people with a connection like this should totally be seeing each other if we're both still 5 minutes away. She then said she wasn't sure, a 180 from the day before and I said fine, if she wasn't sure then it was a no. But, I did ask about prospects after travelling, conversationally and she said ""who knows, maybe I'll come back and fall in love with a ...(described me) 


A few weeks later, She went and I stayed for a while working which was definitely rubbish. But I said I hoped she had a good trip and we ended up sending a few messages back and forth each day, pictures, what we were up to...and it evolved. For the last 5 weeks while being in Europe, we've talked every night, full on conversations, sexting, nudes, FaceTime videos and phone calls, pictures of our days and messages saying how much we were looking forward to seeing each other. I quote ""I was sat looking at a Turkish sunrise the other day, one of the most beautiful things I've seen on my trip and I could only think about how excited I was to see you"" HOLY MOLY BOYS, we've made it. She even got some fun tea for the bedroom. 

I sent her a postcard saying a similar thing which still hasn't arrived. 

So she gets back a week before and the messages slow.... and so
For the story likes.... and I don't push. I get a Voice memo one day out of the blue saying she's got a job offer abroad (she's gone home to no job and no money) but is hanging with friends daily. I sent a text saying I was sad that she would leave but if that's what she wanted then do it!!! 
Upon that she apologised for being missing in action and said it's just been crazy. I sent her a few messages suggesting she had some space from me so she didn't feel bad and constantly apologise for not replying to something or whatever. She said that it was so undertaken and rare and how much she felt supported and how amazing I am. I said I felt appreciated and to have a good few days. She said she definitely didn't want a cold cut but space would be nice. Cool! Fine :)

I sent a text a few days later to say I was thinking of her and sent a photo of my day, she replied a few times which had me a bit confused so I asked if the space was over and if she could tell me how much she wanted me to message just as I wanted to support her and respect the space if she didn't want a conversation and she replied with something saying I needed someone to prioritize me and we should catch up in person when I got back ... now this freaked me out ngl it was very different to her usual messages so we called....

And she said she wanted to make sure we weren't jumping into anything and that we wouldn't be dating or exclusive. I said that to be honest after 2 months of daily texting and intimate texts I expected no prioritisation, commitment or anything of any kind, except that I didn't want to see anyone else. UH OH. We ended up having the same chat we had before and 2 hours later the few days of less messaging is now 2 weeks of suggested silence to ""work things out"" and nothing except a casual relationship which I'm either cool with or not. So!!!!! 

Be cool with casual!? Or was I being led on and obviously developing feelings and have a right to ask for no sleeping with other dudes. Orrr option 3, is the casual a cover for the fact that she is really into me but is just freaking about the idea of commitment. 

TLdR:

Girl who basically love bombed me twice pulled away randomly (maybe not randomly from a different perspective) and now I'm confused and very sad but willing to understand.

Our reality is virtual, the universe is holographic. Time and space don¬¥t exist, but the illusion of time and space does exist to enable us to have specific experiences in a 3d illusion game.

Abstract and key words:¬†

The article provides a comparison of the two cosmologies of Bashar and Seth. Both sources of information are not real from our point of view, the information is channeled. According to them, however, it is rather our own reality that is not really real. It is a projection of consciousness within consciousness, similar to a dream, constantly being recreated at the rate of Planck time. What we perceive as outer reality is a reflection of our own state of being. Time and space do not exist. They are an illusion. But the illusion of time and space does exist to allow us to experience a 3d reality game in an individualized and unique way. The experiences that we generate as players in our lives are our own indelible contribution to creation. The article comes with its own genuine definition of identity and consciousness.

Combine it with Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge. Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real¬¥ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls¬¥, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE¬¥ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you¬¥ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about.",0,1728068743.0,consciousness,2,0.5,False

As a background, I'm a straight male university grad student in my 20s. I've noticed this issue throughout my undergrad and its gotten to point where I can't ignore it anymore, as I feel its holding me back from meaningfully socializing with people around me. For example, in classes I notice people seem to actively avoid sitting next to me. During class, I do my best to mind my own business, sit up straight, and focus on the board, but I can't help but notice strange glances towards me from others, especially if a make a small movement or sound. I'm generally a very private person, and have no social media accounts, but it feels like there's this secret or rumor about me that only I am not aware of. People tend to make strange, baseless assumptions about me, like I'm dumb or incompetent, and I'm lost trying to figure out what about how I carry myself verbally and physically causes this. In conversations, I do my best to keep attentive eye contact with occasional breaks to not make others uncomfortable. Walking outside is hell. I keep my head down, headphones on, and wear sunglasses, but I can't help but notice that people's body language changes when they walk towards/by me. Things like adjusting themselves, pulling out their phone before they walk by, or uneasy side glances. Walking into a coffee shop or other social environment, I've noticed more often than not that conversations seem to end at my presence, like I'm making a scene or entered somewhere I'm not allowed to be, and it makes my just want to leave.

Some things I've worked on:

Hygiene:

I consistently shower twice daily, scented body wash on every surface of my body 2x daily, conditioner 1x daily, shampoo 2x weekly. I brush, floss, tongue scrap, and mouthwash 2x per day. Before going out I apply deodorant, scented moisturizer, hair product, and a conservative amount of pleasant smelling cologne.

Appearance:

I'm short in stature, physically in shape, with a full, trimmed beard (I suspect this may be the issue). I don't think I'm necessarily ugly and don't have any disfigurements, but friends and companions have made strange comments about how I'm ""handsome"" or ""sexy"" enough in a way that I get the sense that there is something off about my appearance. I try to dress in plain, inoffensive clothes that I never wear more than once before washing, and I have no tattoos.

I'm mostly wondering if there is any social science behind this issue, like certain intrinsic factors about people, both controllable or uncontrollable, that make others around them feel uneasy around them. Are there any social do's and don't s that I could not be considering in my day-to-day interactions that are making people uncomfortable. If anyone has experience with this issue, especially overcoming it, I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks.",4,1728068643.0,socialanxiety,6,1.0,False

1fw6yln,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1fw6yln/seeking_support/,Seeking Support,"Hello all, I hope that all is well. I am posting because I have been struggling with a breakup, that I am starting to think was with a female narcissist. 

  
I am a 28 yo Male, and my ex is 24.  We met approximately two years ago at a bar and had a one night stand.  She did not reply but did make a last minute date where we had one of the best dates I have ever experienced. That night we had an amazing physical connection, and made a follow up date.  She ghosted me and then replied the next day, knowing I had left the area.  Multiple attempts to contact were not reciprocated.  One day I was in Maine, her home, and posted a story so she asked to meet up.  We then had another nice date, and after that corresponded regularly.  I ended up moving, in large part because of her, to her area.  When we reconnected we quickly got into a relationship within a week.

  
The following relationship was then very good in many ways, we spent every day together and had alot of fun.  We had a vacation very early on that legit felt like a honeymoon.  Sometimes cracks would show, such as her flirting with other dudes in front of me for nicotine, and going through my phone.  To be fair, I was still adjusting to a relationship and would sometimes ponder if I got into a relationship too soon, and texted a friend this which she saw.  Additionally, once or twice I would absent mindedly check out other women. I also might have called her my exes name two months into it, not during sex or anything.  in my defense, her niece was about to come over and they have the same name so it was on the brain.  At this point she was like fully invested, and so was I but maybe with some hesitation. 

We would go to concerts together, and spent a majority of our time with just us. We both met our families, although she last second changed plans to meet mine for thanksgiving. She claimed it was because in my phone I told a friend I wonder if I should've stayed single longer and was not ready. Sometimes when we were apart I would text too often, and be emotional.  However we were usually able to patch things over.

  
For Christmas I went to her family, despite her not meeting mine yet.  On the night of Christmas I texted all of my friends merry Christmas.  One of them was a female friend, who was dating a good friend of mine.  She replied with saying she wanted to see me.  I suggested a double date or getting coffee just the two of us. My girlfriend was upset all night, and told me not to do this again.  I deleted the text of asking for coffee, and she became suspicious. 

  
Things were fine that Spring, and we made plans to move in together.  We were going to go to live near her family, but her mother had some complications and last minute the plan changed.  I made arrangements to move near my family, and we quickly found an apartment. This was an apartment I could not afford, but it made her happy. At this time she found out a month prior that I had replied to an ex of mine on snapchat.  I am not sure why I did it, but the conversation was genuinely benign.  My ex (hookup of a month not serious) snapped me that she had recently broken up with a boyfriend she lived with.  I said I had a relationship and asked for advice on living together.  A month later I told my girlfriend that this happened.  I did not think the interaction was problematic, but I withheld it from her due to concerns she would leave. 

  
A month later she read my journal and saw that I wrote a had a little excitement hearing from the old hookup, and that sometimes I think about flirting with other woman (who have bigger breasts lol) but that my girlfriend was irreblaceable so I know those thoughts are dumb.  After reading my journal my girlfriend left for q week and told me she went to a different place than she did, I found out from a peripheral friend (she hid her story frmo everyone I know) that she was in Oregon and not Florida. She kept telling me we were broken up and would not talk to me about the issue.  After a week she came back and I tried to tell her that is not a good way to communicate and her actions really hurt me.  Additionally reading my journal is like a giant boundary crossing.  She reframed things to be about how she was hurt, and I begged for forgiveness.

  
We kept living together for some time and things were good.  When visiting her family she kept extending her trip and missed her birthday with me which was never the plan. She went to Miami with her mom and I only found out when bored at work and checking her location.  Thanksgiving she once again left, and Christmas I once again visited her family.  During this visit my girlfriend started to become colder, not doing things with me and touching me less. This made me frustrated and this is where the dynamic really shifted.

  
After this we were okay, but she began to become frustrated with our living situation.  She had not looked for a job so her days were spent just waiting for me to come home.  When I would get home I would want to relax and cuddle, and she would want to go to dinner and get drinks.  We lived in Connecticut, so its not like there is a huge downtonw scene.

  
To feel more fulfilled she applied to graduate school and the plan was to move together.  Before moving she wanted to do one more visit to home, and during this she got a dog against my wishes.  Soon after that we went to a concert where she sat and acted miserable the whole time.  On many occasions she would want to go out when I would be falling asleep, and would mingle in ways that made me uncomfortable. Despite planning to go to Florida, she accepted an application to go to school in NYC.  I began to apply for jobs, and we toured some apartments.

  
About a week later I found she had been making arrangements with a classmate to move in to an apartment, without me.  I found this out because I called myself with her phone and she got a message from a girl I had never heard of.  My girlfriend reported she wanted to be able to focus on class and not worry about what I was doing when she wasnt there or tailoring her schedule around me.  She aso would never let me take the dog out, even though I have owned dogs my whole life. My girlfriend said she thought it was best if we did long distance, but did not want to lose me.

Things were okay, though we were no longer being intimate more than once a week, but anytime an argument arose it felt like she was on the verge of leaving me.  At one point she said ""what are you offering as a partner"".  When she attended a funeral for an ex boyfriend, she came home talking about how she felt validated because everyone was treating her like his widow.  She also then said that she had facetimed her most seminal ex boyfriend while away for the funeral.  I lost focus on supporting her emotionally and felt uncomfortable that she would facetime and ex or feel good about being treated like a widow, given that she would not have been comfortable with the same. 

  
We then moved out of our place.  During the few weeks of long distance we last she would go out often and disappear without messaging me much, having her roommate take care of the dog. I would tell her that I just wanted a little more communication and she said she heard me but nothing changed. Two days before she was to visit, for a wedding, for the first time since moving out, she had a friend stay with her three extra days and barely communicated.  She said she would call me about a plan, but never made herself available.  I called her, way too many times, and she said this isnt working she needs her independence and we broke up the day before my best friends wedding. Although we didnt technically breakup, she just said we need to talk.

  
8 days went by before I asked her to talk, since i did not know where we stood.  it was then that she broke up with me.  We agreed to not talk to each other and part.  That night she went out and texted me something about an inside joke even though I had just set my boundaries.  We then did not speak unless I initiated, wanting clarity on things and being confused.  She never texted about getting her stuff until I finally asked to make a plan.

  
When she visited we like had a date and some amazing breakup sex, stupid I know.  During this she told me she was not interested in dating at all, and needed to find herself since she is so young. She acted like I would date first and was worried she would lose me, saying that we should reconnect after a month and see where things go. Then, we blocked each other as agreed.  

Later that week I reached out to say this breakup is dumb, we love each other and should not be wasting life not fighting for that.  She agreed but we said to not jump right back into things.  However we would speak twice a day and still said I love you to each other.  A few days later I asked her what we were and she said ""we are just chit chatting to stay in each others lives to see where things go"".  That triggered me as it seemed to not really incorporate my needs.  I asked to talk on the phone and she ghosted me for a day, until texting me while on the subway to go out drinking with friends.  This made me upset, and she never replied.

After a month she kept reaching out to check in, even though I would succinctly reply if at all.  Eventually I caved and asked why she was doing this, to which she said to make sure I am not an enemy. Hearing from her so nonchalantly set my healing back an awful lot.  I recently found out that right after the breakup she got on the dating apps, and starting posting revealing photos which she had never done.  I also now know that about a month after we saw each other she was in another relationship, and is currently seeing this person.  Anytime she talks to me she acts like what she did was okay, and is very inconsistent. I got really anxiously attached at the end there so I get why I would not seem appealing, but to go from we will reconnect after a month, then two, then two year, was just confusing.  I know now that it was all words, and figured that previously, but it is still all really confusing.  After a two year relationship to immediately be in a relationship with someone else, when she does not typically get into relationships, crushed me and also made me really angry. 

I guess I am posting this giant novel to get some perspective.  I feel like I have taken away alot, and part of me is getting to peace with she clearly was never invested like I was, even though she would often say the opposite.  I feel like for a long time I have been going insane with the mixed signals, and am hoping to be validated by others reporting a similar experience and reaction. Although I am better, I cant stop thinking about her being with this other person, talking about me and all this other stuff.  Especially a month after having an amazing time together and her telling me all this things I want to hear.  I know that it just wasn't right for either of us, and maybe I got led on, but I am hoping to connect with others as a way of healing further.  I don't really have hope anymore, but I find myself waiting for her to reach out again so I can slam the door in her face. If you made it this far, you must be an English Major. Its hard not to be hard on myself, or feel terrible about the whole thing. I cant tell how much I was manipulated, and the person that I thought existed was maybe all on act.

I love books that look at this stuff from a very sociological lens as well, as in what the style/architecture says about the social/cultural/economic etc. conditions and aspirations. As you may be able to tell I'm a total novice and eager to read and learn, so the more approachable the book is for the layperson (in terms of architecture-specific lingo and concepts), the better. Not looking for coffee table books though, more analysis and history. Beyond atomic age futurism if anyone has any recs on these kinds of books in general about any genres of architecture/design I would love to hear them :) Thanks in advance!!",2,1728068464.0,architecture,0,1.0,False

1fw6xpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1fw6xpu/what_an_rollercoasteradvice_on_exclusivity/,What an rollercoaster‚Ä¶.Advice on Exclusivity!???,"Hey all!! This is my first ever question to the masses, just looking for some opinions really to help myself mull it all over. 

Long Version: (TLDR below) 

So, I'm a single guy travelling, and ended up staying in another country for way longer than I anticipated. I went with an ex girlfriend of mine and we ended up splitting over different lifestyles and goals in life (I wanted to stay and travel, she didn't) we talked about it loads and that was just the natural conclusion. 4 months later! I'm single and ready to mingle, and I see an absolute bombshell. Who, I approach and ask out. To my delight she says yes! And although texting is suggesting pretty much no interest, after bumping into each other randomly one day we end up hanging out all evening. This leads to a couple of dates that range from beach sunset picnic cuddles and climbing walls with a big group of friends to private campfires with wine and...ya know. The intimacy straight off the bat was INSANE!!! We got on like a house on fire, our interests are all the same, politics, travel aspirations, and I feel like we're at the same stage in life although I'm 27 and she's 23. I've just finished grinding in work and am ready to travel while she is in her travel phase. She's spent time in the country I grew up in, her interests and volunteering is what I studied at university! And Aside from that the attraction, morals, general chat and communication is all awesome

On the first date (alone, had one with friends first) she mentions travelling to Europe in a few months. Cool! I'm going too (for work and family) she actually suggests that the stars are aligned and she'll come to see me there! Ended up basically making out and talking about sex and what we liked and etc etc great evening. Wow what a fairytale. 

Second date, AMAAAZING, beach swim, slackening, cuddles in a hammock and kissing in front of a sunset, from 9am to 9pm. The whole time we talk about how much we feel this is crazy but also feels right! I was stroking her hair and gave a few cheek kisses, and I got a few back. Neither of us have been so comfortable so fast. She even describes me as perfect. I should pop by her work the next day as I drive past (as I was already). 

So I drive past and somethings up, she's stressed, I ask why, ""nothing!""
Then we sit down and it comes up... I'm going travelling and I want to be single. To be honest this did suck, but it's a total green flag, she was already opening up to
Communicate about it and said she really wanted to get the record straight before anymore happened. I was obviously a bit unprepared for this and sad given the last few dates and weeks of messaging and how much I liked her but, it's a fair thing to hear. Who wants to be tied down by someone you just met after planning a Europe trip for a few months. 

I took the day to thinks about it and I am an emotional person so I was really confid and upset (still values for her to say)

We decided later on in the evening that we would just be ""BEEEEST FRIENDS"" after a long concert where both of us basically said, dunno what to do about this it kinda blows. 


Anyway fast track - next date is a day at mine and we end up having coffee with a view at a Roman villa, picnicking with her friend and then cuddling in a hammock all afternoon and napping. Now I slipped up here on the ""casual"" and was still being very intimate, and while cuddling in the hammock half asleep I said I felt lucky. And she said she felt lucky. ""SHIIIIIIIT"" 
Anyway the sunset came and her friend wanted to go so they left. A text came in later saying how spending time with me was like living in some kind of dream and that she can't wait to just sleep next to me. We had our first proper text convo ""F******K""

4th and finally she came for dinner at mine, my housemates and I had a fire, we drank wine and then we headed to bed.....AMAAAAZZZIIINNNGGGGG, not just because we'd already talked about it, had loads of lent up desire from dating and were on the same page physically, just, the connection. While looking into each others eyes she said Tom....I really like you. 

Next day we had a lazy wake up and I made her breakfast before we headed to a viewpoint. Where she said she wanted to talk about something..... 
I still want to be single.... this was not on my mind at all but led to a 4 hour long conversation where the jist was, I want to be casual and then go travelling, I'm not coming to see you in Europe and I might not come back, WOAH. I (perhaps sillily on paper) said I had enough feelings now that the idea of not being exclusive before she went was ahit and just made me anxious. She said that she didn't want to see anyone else, she'd even declined to give her number to someone because she ""had a boyfriend"" but exclusivity no matter how you look at it is a type of relationship, and that is not what she wants. Bummer. 

I said I'd decide on it and we tried our best to forget the conversation for the rest of the evening. Had fun playing board games laughing (both of us couldn't shift the fact that we felt weird and sad however) we cuddled and hugged and kissed at another viewpoint before heading home. She invited me to come climbing but I was so drained from the conversation (and crying in front of her lol) that I said I'd stay. 

A day later I sent a text saying that I couldn't do it. I was too invested and liked her too much a. It was just going to be shit. But the reason I liked her was just seeing her and being near her! So I couldn't do that and we cut ties. I then saw her a few times in person given we have the same hobbies and it basically just ended up being us hanging out anyway. During one such hang out she said it was really hard not seeing me and that she wished we could still. I went in to her work the next day and said I thought it was all stupid and agreed, two people with a connection like this should totally be seeing each other if we're both still 5 minutes away. She then said she wasn't sure, a 180 from the day before and I said fine, if she wasn't sure then it was a no. But, I did ask about prospects after travelling, conversationally and she said ""who knows, maybe I'll come back and fall in love with a ...(described me) 


A few weeks later, She went and I stayed for a while working which was definitely rubbish. But I said I hoped she had a good trip and we ended up sending a few messages back and forth each day, pictures, what we were up to...and it evolved. For the last 5 weeks while being in Europe, we've talked every night, full on conversations, sexting, nudes, FaceTime videos and phone calls, pictures of our days and messages saying how much we were looking forward to seeing each other. I quote ""I was sat looking at a Turkish sunrise the other day, one of the most beautiful things I've seen on my trip and I could only think about how excited I was to see you"" HOLY MOLY BOYS, we've made it. She even got some fun tea for the bedroom. 

I sent her a postcard saying a similar thing which still hasn't arrived. 

So she gets back a week before and the messages slow.... and so
For the story likes.... and I don't push. I get a Voice memo one day out of the blue saying she's got a job offer abroad (she's gone home to no job and no money) but is hanging with friends daily. I sent a text saying I was sad that she would leave but if that's what she wanted then do it!!! 
Upon that she apologised for being missing in action and said it's just been crazy. I sent her a few messages suggesting she had some space from me so she didn't feel bad and constantly apologise for not replying to something or whatever. She said that it was so undertaken and rare and how much she felt supported and how amazing I am. I said I felt appreciated and to have a good few days. She said she definitely didn't want a cold cut but space would be nice. Cool! Fine :)

I sent a text a few days later to say I was thinking of her and sent a photo of my day, she replied a few times which had me a bit confused so I asked if the space was over and if she could tell me how much she wanted me to message just as I wanted to support her and respect the space if she didn't want a conversation and she replied with something saying I needed someone to prioritize me and we should catch up in person when I got back ... now this freaked me out ngl it was very different to her usual messages so we called....

And she said she wanted to make sure we weren't jumping into anything and that we wouldn't be dating or exclusive. I said that to be honest after 2 months of daily texting and intimate texts I expected no prioritisation, commitment or anything of any kind, except that I didn't want to see anyone else. UH OH. We ended up having the same chat we had before and 2 hours later the few days of less messaging is now 2 weeks of suggested silence to ""work things out"" and nothing except a casual relationship which I'm either cool with or not. So!!!!! 

Should I be cool with casual!? Or was I being led on and obviously developing feelings and have a right to ask for no sleeping with other dudes. Orrr option 3, is the casual a cover for the fact that she is really into me but is just freaking about the idea of commitment. 

TLdR:

Girl who basically love bombed me twice pulled away randomly (maybe not randomly from a different perspective) and now I'm confused and hurt but willing to understand. I need opinions!!

Over the last few weeks ive been keeping a better eye on our bank account, trying to be more involved and responsible. We have been together for 14 years, married for 4 of them. We have been having a pretty rough few weeks, lots of bickering and arguments that have snow balled into this.

Today is my pay day, we share a bank account and both of our checks go into it. while texting my partner I mentioned i was going to buy  a 2pack of t-shirts off Amazon for $11, and $2 worth of replacement tips for my paint pen. 

Yes i do own a lot of clothing (I've recently lost over 100lbs and almost nothing fits me properly anymore. Because of the massive weight loss my partner and I can wear the same size tshirts). No, I am not stealing their clothes.  We share a  closet. 

Yes, I did get a new pair of $30 work shoes weeks ago, and a costco pack of socks last week. ive been wearing the same pair of work shoes for nearly 2 years, at 40 hours a week. 

Yes, I did spent $45 to get my haircut and beard trim. I've tried to cut my own hair before, it.....didnt go well. 

Between my $10 bar tab, and my refillable paint pen i spent $14 on Tuesday of this week. 

Full disclosure- my partner has a SMI. Several years ago they were diagnosed with a personality disorder that makes controlling their emotions/feelings nearly impossible.  This causes them to have VERY big reactions.  

It's not new for my partner to suggest/hint  we should end our marriage/separate after a disagreement. I know it's a defense mechanism. It doesn't make it any less shitty for me to hear/read it.",5,1728068228.0,Manipulation,10,1.0,False
1fw6urz,https://i.redd.it/7x898f20essd1.jpeg,Reflections of a first time electric car owner. 3 months with the 2018 Leaf,"We've now had our 2018 high mileage 40kWh ex- taxi just over 3 months and done about 2200miles.  It seems to meet the needs of about 85% of our journeys with no issues, and could do the other 15% with some planning.

Observations so far:

Pros

It's GREAT having car that just works when you press the on button.

It's a practical size and ideal for moving our parents about.

Nice large boot with good access.

Controls simple and easy to use - and you can switch off lane assist etc permanently.

It's objectify identifiable as a modern car - everyone who has tried it says it just feels like a normal car. This is great for people not used to them.

Service parts like brakes and tyres seem cheap (based on having a look, it's not needed anything yet).

Bluetooth connection for the phone is useful for easy choonage.

The ability to do other things whilst it is fuelling up (it's a passive activity so you don't need to be at the car the whole time).

The torque is great. It surprised a fair few folk when hillclimbing.

Cheap to run.

 

Cons:

Cost of entry to electric car ownership. This is the most expensive car I have ever bought, and I'm lucky enough to be in the position to afford it outright. They are cheap to run but expensive to start with. Certainly, you could get a fairly economic diesel for significantly less.

Forward visibility at the A posts is atrocious.

The centre console is huge for no reason (may be a leftover of being backed on an ICE floorpan?).

Using it takes forward planning - I e. You have to remember to charge it before using it.  Even using a rapid CHADEMO charger adds 30mins to a trip - you can't just nip to the local garage and pop ¬£20 in and be on your way.

Public chargers can be variable. Not a car issue but one that crops up

Longer journey times are increased both because of charging stop times (no pee and grab a takeaway coffee). I've yet to try major distance but think I can offset this by planning.

1fw6uie,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1fw6uie/our_trip_to_rome_a_quick_recap_with_food_and_tour/,Our Trip to Rome: A Quick Recap with Food and Tour recommendations.,"Last week, my wife and I spent 5 amazing days in Rome. r/ItalyTravel and r/Rome Reddit groups helped me with planning, and I wanted to share my experiences here with future Rome visitors. Here are some¬† highlights:

**Landing and Airport**¬†  
  
We arrived at FCO, where immigration turned out to be a bit of a nightmare‚Äîabout a two-hour wait for those without biometric passports (i.e. for around 140 countries). Depending on the district you stay in, you can choose the regional train or Leonardo Express for airport transfer. Unlike blog recommendations, we found it quicker to take the regional train, as we stayed in Trastevere.¬†Quick note: The ticket validation machines seem to be broken at the airport. We did travel without validation, but it's better to let someone at the station know about this issue before boarding to be safe. I think since the train starts from the airport, they do not bother checking, maybe?¬†

**Accommodation**  
  
We stayed at B&B Trastevere, a fantastic hotel. Everyone was welcoming and helpful. The¬†room was cleaned daily and was very comfortable, cost-effective and spacious.

**Public transport**  
  
We decided on the B&B Trastevere because it‚Äôs next to the tram station and takes you straight to the centre of Rome. But unfortunately, the trams are closed for renovation till the end of the year. Alternate bus services run along the same tram route but aren't on time and can get quite crowded. We took the ‚Ç¨24 CIS 7-day pass, which needs validation only once - the first time you use it. Don't forget to write your name and DOB on the card. This was the most convenient thing ever as we never had to tap in or validate anywhere else, which is very difficult to do when it gets crowded on the bus. During the 5 days in Rome, we were asked to show our tickets to the inspector thrice. So, take that ticket and validate it.

**Food**  
  
We tried the famous places only in Rome. Notable mentions below,

* Gelato - Gelateria La Romana - the best we tried!
* Pizza - Pinsa 'mp√≤ near Vatican, Pizza ZaZa - small place, good pizza sold by weight.
* Pasta - Verso Sara, - Amatriciana
* Tiramisu - 2 Sizes Tiramisu - tried both classic and pistachio. Both are good.
* Coffee - Good everywhere; don't forget to try Maritozzi while you are at it
* Sandwich - Pane e Salame - went with their recommendations.
* Street Food - Trapizzino Trastevere - very tourist-friendly and great food

**Tours**  

* Best of Historical Center of Rome by Live Virtual Guide - The owner, Federica itself, took our tour, which was very informative and interactive. She is a great storyteller and knowledgeable.
* Borghese Gallery Tour - Highly recommended to do with a guide. We are not museum people at all. But still, we loved this experience with our Guide Claudia from 'Inside Out Italy'. We got to see Bernini, Caravaggio, and Raphael's works in person, with a guide explaining everything in detail.
* Twilight Trastevere Rome Food Tour - This 4-hour tour we took from Eating Europe. We loved our guide, Carolina, who asked to stay together like an Italian family. Being toxic, lol! The experience was good, and the guide was fun. Since we are alcoholics, we would have liked to have seen a better selection of wine or more local drinks for the tour.
* Colosseum, Palatine Hill and Roman Forum Tour - We went with 'Walks Italy'. Our guide, Michale, was so good. The guides from Walks Italy know their history. The guide had good¬†knowledge and storytelling ability and answered all our questions. I found the visit to the Roman forum more interesting than the Colosseum tour because of how he explained the history.
* Pristine Sistine Early Entrance Small Group Vatican Tour - We went again with 'Walks Italy'. Sev was the best guide we ever had in life. Very knowledgeable and informative. We wanted him to continue even after spending roughly 5 hours with¬†him. This man knows his history and art. He is a highly recommended guide, and if you can choose him, please do. The only downside about the tour is that, even if it says it's early morning and has fewer¬†people, that's not the case. It's a very crowded tour indeed. But we decided to overlook this since the guide was terrific.
* Angels and Demons tour - I read this book around 10 years ago and wanted to visit the places mentioned. Unfortunately, Trenitalia had other plans. They had an infrastructure failure, and the trains never arrived. We ended up missing the tour. We tried to contact the operator to reach the second location of the tour, but they weren't helpful or apologetic about what happened.

Anyway, that's the summary of our trip to Rome. I hope this helps someone.¬†",1,1728068187.0,ItalyTravel,5,0.57,False

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve recently started Elvanse and could use some advice from those with more experience. I have combined-type ADHD, autism, and OCD, - the holy trinity of fuckery! I was only diagnosed in June this year at 39 years old. I began taking Elvanse (started at 20mg, now at 40mg) about a month ago. I haven‚Äôt really noticed any difference so far, and I‚Äôm not sure what to expect.

I take it every day at 7am, followed by a high-protein breakfast. Then I do meditation, breath work and stretches before having a cold shower to kick in once the tablets are one hour into being in my system. Throughout the day, I drink 3 litres of water, decaf green tea, and avoid coffee and alcohol. I also do a
Midday reading and meditation / grounding.My only indulgence is a small amount of dark chocolate later in the day when the meds should be wearing off. One thing I just learned (that my psychiatrist didn‚Äôt mention!) is that I should be mindful of Vitamin C intake, so I‚Äôm keeping an eye on that now. Finally I end the day with breath work and meditation again. So whilst perhaps not perfect I do feel I do a lot of good things to help improve my symptoms - the main one being anxiety which can be horrible. 

I‚Äôm really unsure how to tell if the meds are working. My psychiatrist said I would ‚Äújust know,‚Äù but with my other challenges, like stomach issues, brain fog, and lethargy, it‚Äôs hard to tell what‚Äôs caused by my meds and what‚Äôs not. One odd thing is that I can still nap around 12:30pm, even on 40mg‚Äîhas anyone else experienced that?

I am fortunate as do not experience any other side effects besides the dry mouth which again is odd with how much water I have. I do some exercise, which i know I could be better at, however I do get a lot of activity with having a 3 year old and 1 year old to run after. 

Does anyone have advice on how to get the most out of the medication, or tips for recognising when it‚Äôs working? I‚Äôm open to any thoughts! As mentioned I have 2 young kids and suffered a severe burnout in Feb this year which resulted in me being signed off work until July, so I am desperate to make this work and get better. Or is one month too early for anything to be noticeable as I had many people say how life changing it is and really want a positive experience. 

Thanks in advance!

Just had my first ever cupping session, and honestly, it was such a sick experience! There were about 10 different coffees to taste, and I was super excited, but I held back a bit since I didn‚Äôt want to come off as too nerdy in front of the group. So I didn‚Äôt ask all the questions I had for the expert leading the session, which I kinda regret.

Tasting 10 different beans was a bit overwhelming, though. By the time I got to the 5th or 7th cup, my taste buds were all over the place, and I could barely tell one coffee from another. So next time, I‚Äôm planning to keep it simple ‚Äì just 4 cups max ‚Äì to really focus on the flavors and not burn out my palate. It was still an amazing experience, but I feel like I‚Äôll get more out of it by slowing down and limiting the number of coffees.

I‚Äôll definitely be doing this for the rest of my life, and next time, I‚Äôll stop caring about what people think and go all-in with the nerdy questions! Anyone else experience the same thing in their first cupping session?",2,1728067755.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

he was based from a different city but his location was close to mine. 

we instantly hit it off. even tho we were from different cities we were planning to fly down to see each other. 

he went to travel to europe for a month, but he constant kept in touch - regular ft, always texting 

when he did get back to the country, he said that he wanted to be the first one to come fly down and to see me.

it didn‚Äôt matter- i was smitten by him.

we lined our work schedules and it finally happened, he was coming down for the weekend! 

he said that he was gonna crash at a friends place while he was gonna stay here- cool

we spent all of saturday together. he was so much better than i expected. 

TOTAL GENTLEMAN, didn‚Äôt even lift a finger while we were together, had the most incredible date (he had planned everything) he made me feel super special. 

i would have kept the day going but he wanted to go out w his friends, which i was bummed about but he promised we‚Äôd go to a sundowner party on sunday eve- he got reservations and everything sorted.

sunday morning: 
he is not answering to my texts. i assumed he might have been up late and that‚Äôs why. 

the reservations are at 5, i get a text from him around 4:30.

i was pissed. i went out w by bsf and wanted to spend the day w her. she said i should still go see the guy and see what he has to say.

i agree. in a cab to go see him.

he then calls and says they he won‚Äôt be able to make it, bcs his other friend was flying out of town and he really wanted to go see him. 

i am shook.

he says that he is sorry and that he‚Äôll make it upto me.

i let it slide. 

monday morning: i go back to work and he had previously mentioned he wanted to explore that side of town as well (near my office) 

asks when do i get off, 6:30 i said. he says cool; he‚Äôll come pick me up. i get excited to see him again.

it‚Äôs 6:30 he‚Äôs running a little late, i told no worries, i‚Äôll wait by a cafe near my office and grab us some coffee. 

it‚Äôs 7, i am waiting at the cafe, asking for updates -NOTHING. i call him, he is declining my calls.

im up and ready to leave. he calls me back.

‚Äúi am not feeling too well, i got out of the cab and i puked, haven‚Äôt been feeling well all morning‚Äù 

i am taken aback.

i make sure that he is feeling better and ask him to take a cab home.

he does, i ask him to share his location to make sure that he gets home safe. he stops sharing the location midway.

since then he hasn‚Äôt replied to any of my texts or calls. i have no idea of what this man is upto - if he‚Äôs better or not. he hasn‚Äôt blocked me or anything from anywhere.

1fw6noh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1fw6noh/should_i_pursue_a_guy_im_not_attracted_to/,Should I pursue a guy I'm not attracted to?,"I would like to hear people's thoughts and opinions on a woman pursuing a man when there is no physical or emotional or mental attraction. I know our Lord is someone who looks at the heart and not the outward appearance, so I've been praying very hard to not discount a potential connection just merely on that basis. However, would it be wise to continue to pursue a man with whom the only commonality I currently see is that he's a self-proclaimed Christian? For more context, I initially pursued him and gotten coffee with this man (although more or less under a platonic context) and dropped hints that I would be interested in doing more hang-outs with him. But to date there has not been a follow-up on his end. I wonder if I would need to be more obvious about my intent to pursue to see whether or not he reciprocates, but at the same time, I'm feeling rather ambivalent because I feel that there is no physical or emotional or spiritual attraction (he seemed to be a rather lukewarm Christian so not sure about his spiritual maturity to lead me, whose faith is frankly not that strong). I also worry whether he was intimidated (?) during our last meet-up due to my age (I'm older than he his) and income status relative to him. 

On a slightly off-topic, I'm also wondering in general, if it's biblical for a woman to pursue a man even if she's not really attached/attracted to him, but for the purpose of seeking to be in a covenant relationship (instead of burning with passions)?

Any words of wisdom and prayers from fellow brothers and sisters in Christ would be greatly appreciated! Thank you :)",0,1728067694.0,ChristianDating,10,0.33,False

I adopted my boy from the shelter I work at early/mid August 2024. He was ~8wks old found on the street by himself. Covered in scabs and fleas, fearful of humans, generally shutting down in the kennel setting. 
Immediately when I saw him something kind of drew me to him. 
My husband and I had somewhat discussed the idea of getting a third dog but that it needed to be a male because our two females don‚Äôt love other females (they‚Äôre in their own little clique lol)
I love mixed breeds as my other two rescues are a GSDxMalinoisXAmericanBully and a SmoothCollieXPit (crazy combos‚ÄîI know) but I‚Äôd felt like I wanted a GSD after working in vet med + rescue for a couple years I liked the idea of having that breed. 
Anyways, I frequently sent my husband pictures of available dogs but none of them felt right. We even fostered a few but didn‚Äôt want to keep them. This little guy was different and I have no idea why. 

Fast forward to today: 
I have been working so hard with this guy!
We just got home from a trip downtown where my 17 week old GSD mix puppy sat quietly for 3 hours outside at a coffee shop table. With multiple people passing and talking to him, he just watched but still didn‚Äôt interact unless I gave him the ‚Äògreet‚Äô command, he didn‚Äôt make a sound and mostly just laid under my chair or beside me. He was relaxed, taking treats, drinking water, checking in with me, not trying to wander off, not scared of anything, not bothering anyone. 
I‚Äôm CONVINCED I have one of the best puppies as my other two dogs would‚Äôve done something crackhead-y for sure. 
This makes me so happy because I can use him as an example that you don‚Äôt have to have a purebred to have a good level headed dog. My 100% free dog is my dream dog ü´∂üèº

Than one day I feel like I had a psychotic break and everything felt like it wasn‚Äôt real. I had really painful headaches, ringing in my ears, blurry vision and felt like my balance was off. It was a vicious cycle because it was all I could think about all day, but thinking about it made it worse.

I've been lurking in this sub for a while and I thought I'd share my story of going no contact with my dad aged 13 after spending a couple of weeks with him and realising he was completely unhinged. Apologies this is so long!

I was pretty young when I realised that my relationship with my dad wasn't like other people's. We were not close at all. He might as well have been a housemate when he lived with us, and it's hard to describe, but I felt, I guess, sort of forced to think of him like a dad, when really we were more like strangers. 

Honestly, the first thing I think when I think about him is how disgusting he was. He fucking stank, and when I was little I wouldn't hold his hand because he was so gross. And he would fart constantly. He was also extremely loud (opposite of me).

He lived with us til I was 5 or 6 and all I can really remember about it is him staying in bed all day and having screaming rows with my mother. They had a toxic relationship and even though I was young when they split up, I was relieved that there weren't going to be any more arguments. 

My dad barely acknowledged my existence until he got a girlfriend when I was about ten. He was a leech. He rarely had a job and he saw her as his mealticket, and even though I was a child, I could tell that she was desperate for a man and a baby. 

I started to see him more regularly after this (maybe once a month), but I only ever really went to their house with my cousin or a friend who I spent the day playing with, so we didn't really spend any father-daughter time together.

I was a very anxious child, I hated being away from my mother and I had a thing about sleeping anywhere other than my own bed. When I refused to go on a holiday with my dad and his girlfriend, my dad was fuming. So his solution was to force me to go on a holiday for even longer and further away from home. We would also have to spend it doing what he wanted, which was being in a theme park nearly every day, despite him knowing that I was terrified of rollercoasters. 

I really wish I'd put my foot down and been firm about not wanting to go, but I was 12, timid, and was told that they'd booked it and couldn't get their money back. 

So on this holiday was me, my dad, his girlfriend, their baby and my cousin who was my age.

So the first day we get there I was a bit teary and homesick and he was instantly pissed off. The second day, I was teary again and begged him to let me phone my mother (I needed help to figure out the payphones) and this absolutely crossed a line. 

For the next two days he REFUSED to leave the hotel room. His girlfriend would have nothing to do with me, so she took the baby out and left me and my cousin to sit around the hotel grounds. 

After the first day of refusing to leave the hotel room (third day of the holiday overall), he screamed at me that it was my fault that the holiday was ruined, we were all going home early because of me, it was my fault he wouldn't leave the hotel and he wouldn't leave until I admitted that it was all my fault. I was trying my best to ignore him (as best you can when you're a 13-year old girl trapped in a hotel room with a full grown man screaming at you) and this infuriated him even more, so he ripped up my books (I was a really keen reader). I screamed back at him that he was the one ruining the holiday and me reacting seemed to prove to him that he was right?? I told him that once the holiday was over, I didn't want to see him ever again. His girlfriend did absolutely nothing while this was happening.

I can't remember exactly what happened next but by day five he'd agreed to leave the hotel room. I did my best to ignore him, and his girlfriend kept asking me to apologise to him. I told her I'd done nothing wrong by being homesick, I wasn't trying to be naughty and ruin the holiday and she said she knew that, but to do it anyway. I didn't. But even though I thought she was secretly on my side, she later told me that spending time with me had made her realise how vicious I was. 

The only other argument that sticks out is when I panicked because I thought I'd lost a bag with a camera in and my dad shouted at me not to cry. It turned out my cousin had left it with a ride attendant, but he didn't apologise to me or scold her.

Something that was never made clear to me prior to the holiday was the money situation. Apparantly my dad wasn't up for buying all my food, so I had to spend most of the money my mother had given me (which wasnt very much) on food. I remember one time he was feeding the baby a slice of pizza and I asked if I could have some because I was hungry, so he offered me the crust. I asked if I could have more, so he got hold of the pizza and tore a perfect circle around a slice of pepperoni.

Also, this really petty thing happened where I loved these collectible coins you could get at the parks. I got a few with my own money but dad and his gf refused to give me any change for them. The gf literally gave me a handful of change, enough to get at least 10 coins, and told me to use up all the money on coins for her baby, and not to keep any for myself.

On the way home he stressed to me that I was EXACTLY like him, despite us being nothing alike. 

When I got back, my mother picked me up from the airport and I went no contact. He rang the house phone constantly, and as his baby started to grow, he would get the child to ring up every day between me getting in from school and my mother getting in from work (if only my mother had had the common sense to change our phone number).

My cousin started to bully me at school as well. She'd shout 'slag' every time she saw me, but thankfully, this stopped after a few months. 

Fast forward to age 16. I'd just done my GCSEs and received a grovelling letter from his gf saying how much they missed me and how desperate my dad was to hear how I'd done in my exams. And how desperate their kid was for a big sister. Well, consider me manipulated because I got in touch and agreed to meet them for coffee. And guess what. My dad, who was so concerned, was actually surprised that I'd done my GSCEs, because he didn't know how old I was. His fucking gf. I was fuming. She'd thrown a bomb into my life for no reason and I had to go through going no contact again. Seeing them in person was extremely uncomfortable and even before he'd said about not realising I'd done my GCSEs I felt like I'd made a mistake. 

Few years later when I was at uni, my mum had moved in with her new partner and our house had been empty for a few months. She went round to check and there was a message on the answerphone from dad saying he was ill, he was sorry he'd been a bad dad and apologised for ""all the bitterness"" over Christmas. Neither of us knew what he was referring to, so guessed he might have turned up at the house and caused a scene or sent abusive messages to an old mobile number. 

If you think he'd realised what he'd done and decided to change his ways...you'd be wrong. 

A year or two after this I got a friend request from him on Facebook. I stupidly accepted and we made very small talk about music and stuff. 

In a weird way this was good timing because my mother wanted to sell our house and she needed his permission as she'd never got him to sign his share of the house over to her when they split up 18 years earlier (unbelievably stupid, I know). She said that as he'd only worked sporadically, he had contributed very little financially to the mortgage in the five years he'd lived there. 

My mum went to a solicitor to get advice, only for the solicitor to say that she couldn't represent my mum because she was already representing my dad! Sure enough, a letter arrived at the old house with him asking for a few grand that he could spend on his kid, because it was only fair that his kid should benefit from the house sale (my mum met the kid like twice). I told him that he didn't deserve the money, it was more than he had ever contributed and there was no chance of a relationship with me. He said he wouldn't be emotionally blackmailed and blocked me. This is a man who threatened to commit suicide every time my mother tried to split up with him. 

As an aside, he asked my mum to say that she didn't know who my dad was so that he wouldn't be forced to pay child support, which he did unofficially when he got with his gf, then stopped when I went no contact. I have no idea why my mother agreed to this. All I can say is that she's never had a problem she couldn't ignore, and is possibly the most passive person I have ever met. Unfortunately, there is no doubt who my father is.

Anyway! So that's where we are. I was approached by a flying monkey recently, and I wonder what they still have to say about me 20-odd years later and how they explain me going NC to themselves. After this, I stupidly got curious and searched for him on Facebook, but didn't expect to see much as he'd blocked me years before. I saw him tagged in a few things with a cartoon character's name but couldn't click on the profile. It rang a bell, and a little while later I looked at my blocked list and I'd blocked that account years ago. I vaguely remember getting a message from someone who knew my name, but as they had a cartoon name and didn't say who they were, I assumed it was just some weirdo and blocked them.

1fw6h8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Taskfulness/comments/1fw6h8m/how_do_you_feel_when_you_cant_scroll/,How do you feel when you can't scroll?¬†,"Just finished reading **Stolen Focus by Johann Hari.**   
In this book, he shared his experience doing a **3(!) months** screen time detox. He took his current project, rented a house in a small US city, - the Provincetown, and switched off every device that had a screen, to reach complete isolation.   
  
The first days, Hari says, he truly enjoyed the ""simple life"". A few weeks in, however, he noticed a troubling change in his mental state. When going out for groceries or to grab a coffee, he got extremely irritated by the people passing by. What made him feel this way was how freely others accessed what was out of reach for him - their smartphones, the world of information. The author gave it a good reflective thought and talked to attention experts to come up with a **""stimulation hole""** theory.¬†He suspected that, when he went offline, the loss of novelty, and excitement of social media could not be recompensed with real-life adventures, and his ‚Äúnormal‚Äù level of stimulation was unmet.

Although the evidence in this book was somewhat anecdotal, I found his observation very relatable. Even with no detox, I noticed this irritability rising in me, my partner, and even my parents(who are in their 60s) - when left with no access to our phones. For me, I think, it‚Äôs **the sense of control that I miss** when I can‚Äôt read the news.

1fw68kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1fw68kr/25f_25m_is_it_just_a_rough_patch_or_the_end/,"(25F, 25M) Is it just a rough patch or the end? ","I think my boyfriend and I have reached the end our relationship. We have been together for almost a year. I was working a very relaxed WFH job at the time I met him. He wasn‚Äôt working. Being that my job was super flexible, we spent so much time together. All day‚Ä¶every day. I loved being with him. One could blame it on the honey moon phase. He‚Äôs my absolute best friend. My favorite person. Before I continue, I will say this is long and might be all over the place as I try to sum up a year in one sitting.  

Some background: I (25F) struggled a lot growing up and always had to figure things out on my own. I had a rough childhood, it really was always just me. I worked 3 jobs at one point in my life. Even lived in my car for a few days. However, like I said, I always figured it out. I always made a way. I had to grow up quickly. On the other hand, my boyfriend (25M) has never had a job before. Never had bills. His parents always took care of him and covered all his expenses. Though, I won‚Äôt say he has a great family life either. They take care of him out of duty. 

I got laid off 3 months into our relationship and was super concerned about how id be able to pay my bills. I was worried. I submitted countless applications. I was unemployed for 2 months, my car lease was coming to an end at the same time. Stressed. I was stressed. My boyfriend was very comforting. He‚Äôs so good in that way. However, I never really felt like he UNDERSTOOD. I was going to move to Florida to live with my sister, which would‚Äôve been rent free and I wouldn‚Äôt need a car. I stayed for him. 

Eventually I found the job I have now. I have been here for 6 months. It‚Äôs very different from my old job. Very demanding. I don‚Äôt have set hours but some times it gets sooooo busy. It‚Äôs mentally exhausting. During this change, my boyfriend and I argued a lot. He‚Äôd get mad when I didn‚Äôt show him enough affection. Or didn‚Äôt have time to hang out all day. Which I did miss doing but unfortunately, I had to work. Because he‚Äôs never had a job, he wouldn‚Äôt get it. My livelihood depends on this job. This job is the only reason I can stay for us. I try to involve him as much as I can. I invite him to all work events or when I‚Äôm on the road, he tags along with me to keep me company. I call him almost all the time I‚Äôm at work, if he‚Äôs awake because he‚Äôs usually up at 11-12PM. 

This job was an adjustment for me too. Even when I was working 3 jobs, they weren‚Äôt as mentally taxing as this one. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm grateful to be working considering the market and they pay me well. I know if I was ever in a bad spot, my boss would help me.

To continue, we argued a lot. About different things. He would say I‚Äôm not as affectionate anymore, I didn‚Äôt want to hang out, I didn‚Äôt kiss him enough or hug him or I wasn‚Äôt as excited to see him anymore. I wasn‚Äôt soft. I‚Äôm sad to say it‚Äôs true. He was right. And I won‚Äôt try to justify. I feel like he never understood. The stress of real life. Not many people live his lifestyle. On auto-pilot, not having a real sense of what the world and adulting is like. Having to build yourself. I won‚Äôt say this was caused only by work. But my things I started to notice about him overtime.

He talks about getting married a lot. And I want to marry him. But obviously we are no where near financially stable for that. I have been on him about getting a job. Not to pay my bills. My responsibilities were there before him. But for our future. The 8 kids he talks about having. And also to finally cut ties with his family, who are a story of their own. 

Like I said, they pay for everything for him. But they aren‚Äôt great people. Because he‚Äôs dependent, he‚Äôs at their mercy. I converted to Islam before I met my boyfriend. But him being brown, the first few months of our relationship, we were hiding. Which I hated doing but I was ok with sticking it through. I love him. Eventually, the gig was up. And I met his parents. They were accepting. I spent Eid with them, went dress shopping with his mom and older sister, would go to his house to hang out with his mom, etc. I‚Äôd bring his mom flowers, ask if she wanted any food. It was great for a while. 

However, his little sister is the black sheep. She chose a non-Muslim man over the family. I won‚Äôt go into detail as it is not my story to tell. One day she brought him over. My boyfriend saw him at the house and kicked him out. It turned into a huge fight. Ever since then, it‚Äôs been terrible for me. Because her boyfriend couldn‚Äôt go over, she made sure the family didn‚Äôt like me so I couldn‚Äôt go over either. It was her way of getting back at her brother (my boyfriend). I never did anything directly to her or to his family. I was just a causality in the crossfire. His older sister always defended me. I love her. All that to say, I no longer have a relationship with his family. Which breaks my heart. Truly. I miss his mom. But of course they will stick by their daughter, I don‚Äôt blame them. 

Back to the job‚ÄîI know he‚Äôs been applying. He tries so hard. But he wants a job in his field. Cybersecurity. Which has been extremely competitive right now and he has no work experience. He studies almost every night for more certifications. And I‚Äôm so proud of him for that. He doesn‚Äôt ever apply to normal service jobs because it‚Äôs ‚Äúdegrading‚Äù.  Which blows my mind and actually annoys me. How do you expect a $100K+ job with no job experience. How can you talk about a family and getting married when you‚Äôre not willing to do what it takes? Some money is better than no money? Some step toward our future is better, right? Right‚Ä¶? 

During my work events, he‚Äôs helped set up. He‚Äôs so great in that way. Willing to drop anything to help me. One time he drove 50 min to help me move furniture for work. I am extremely grateful. When arrived, there was a lot of complaining. ‚ÄúMy wrist hurts‚Ä¶this is heavy‚Ä¶this is dirty‚Äù and I couldn‚Äôt help but get annoyed. I hate to say it but I need to be truthful‚ÄîI felt like the man. I honestly could have just done it on my own. Without having to baby him. 

He got paid for that. We need a runner for some odd jobs at work and I spoke about the possibility of him taking that on. They would reach out to him for tasks and he could either accept or deny. When I brought it up, he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good at building‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like that‚Äù. And it pushed me further away, because it just seemed lazy to me. We got into an argument about that and his response was ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say no, I‚Äôm just thinking‚Äù and I said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre saying no without saying no. You‚Äôre giving so many excuses to not do it when you could learn a skill along the way‚Äù Like I said, my boss takes care of his people. It could‚Äôve started as a runner but led to a larger opportunity. What did he have to lose? He had all the time in the world. We never spoke about it again. This is became another reason I withdrew.

I have been mean lately. Don‚Äôt misinterpret me. I am no saint. My temper got short, I can‚Äôt stand nonsense questions, I don‚Äôt hug, I don‚Äôt kiss a lot anymore. We haven‚Äôt been intimate. We used to stay in the car for hours talking when he would drop me off at home. Now, I just rush to get out and go inside.

Our latest fight, and the reason I‚Äôm posting this is because he got mad I didn‚Äôt post him for national BF day. We were at a coffee shop and he said ‚Äúwhat picture did you end up posting‚Äù and i told him I didn‚Äôt. He loudly said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the bare minimum‚Äù and walked out. I do love him but I‚Äôm just not happy. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs overall or just right now. I can‚Äôt tell. 

I‚Äôm tired of him cruising through life. I don‚Äôt blame him for the way he grew up, NO ONE should struggle. I don‚Äôt ever wish that upon anyone. But because of that, I have to figure everything out for him. I‚Äôm his first ever girlfriend, so I had to guide him and teach him. Which is ok, but at some point some things don‚Äôt have to be taught. 

The stress of being first girlfriend. I have to have all the answers. His family. Staying here for him when I could be living his life in Florida‚Äîwhich is the stress of my new job. His laziness with working. His complaints about men responsibilities. It‚Äôs all getting to me. To the point that when he walked out on me in the coffee shop, I didn‚Äôt go after him. I felt relieved for a moment actually. Sadly. I have spoken to him about these things before. But like I said, we grew up so differently he doesn‚Äôt get it. 

Another large fight we had was that I don‚Äôt send him selfies throughout the day. And the fact is I just don‚Äôt have time. I rush all my work in the morning and then drive straight to see him and then we hang out or go to the gym. I rush to see him and sometimes even skip work tasks. A selfie is the last thing on my mind, and I see him for hours after work anyway. This is so miniscule to me and he hates when I say that. But THIS is what you‚Äôre arguing about? I know I‚Äôm minimizing his feelings. But I risk my job to go see him.

I built a lot of resentment towards him. Again, I don‚Äôt expect him to take care of me so I don‚Äôt have to work. But I just see no ambition. No drive. He‚Äôs ok with being on autopilot. I have to do everything for him and I‚Äôm someone that figures things out. I use my brain all day at work and I can‚Äôt turn it off around him. I don‚Äôt trust him to lead. To put my guard down. I don‚Äôt want to be an independent women. At all. But I cant rely on him right now. I think our relationship has reached its end. I think he needs someone that can relate to him. That can give him what he wants. I really do love him. He‚Äôs my best friend, but maybe that‚Äôs the extent of our relationship. Or maybe I‚Äôm emotionally I mature, I don‚Äôt know. The man I once loved to my core no longer brings me peace. I am heartbroken. ",1,1728066623.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

1fw664k,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1fw664k/help/,Help,"So I‚Äôll start this off with the fact me and this girl I really like got with each other whilst drunk at a university party. The next morning, we go and get coffee and discuss about whether that would‚Äôve happened if we were sober, to which I said probably yes and she agreed. We then got with each other again after getting back to our room completely sober.

It is important to note that this had happened before, but she didn‚Äôt want a relationship afterwards.

I am not into hookup culture at all, and so asked her via text that I think we should start talking romantically and actually go on dates and do things properly, to which she agreed. We went on a date and it was incredible, and really enjoyable. Throughout the rest of summer holidays, we didn‚Äôt meet up at all as she was on holiday which I thought nothing of, as she had planned this prior to me asking her out, so I thought that after we got back to uni, we could go on more dates and start taking things more seriously. 

We are texting and everything is fine, and then a week before we go back to uni, she sends me a voice mail about how she ‚Äúisn‚Äôt looking for a relationship‚Äù, and how there was nothing romantic between us, and then proceeded to say that she was sure we could make it work and it would be lovely and cute, but she wasn‚Äôt sure she had the effort.

Here is the kicker, we are on the same course and friendship group, and I wasn‚Äôt going to try if I wasn‚Äôt 100% it was something we both wanted, so now I don‚Äôt have a choice but to be friends. 

Should I talk with her about it, as I am still wanting a relationship, and I‚Äôm scared about going on nights out and seeing her get with other guys etc. 

I don‚Äôt know, it was very sudden and painful, and I feel like she led me on for like 3 months.",1,1728066447.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Magical thinking isn‚Äôt always harmful, but Rachel has based her entire belief system and worldview upon magical thinking. The universe is always talking to her, sending her signs, gifts, the egg, feathers, etc. And sure‚Ä¶ signs and symbols can be really reassuring in hard times. But her entire life framework and belief systems are fastened to where everything has to have a deep meaning. I feel like this is something I leaned more into myself when I started following her in 2011. Has anyone else experienced the veil of manifestation and illusion lifted in their own spiritual practice? I feel icky knowing how she‚Äôs commodified magical thinking into her brand of trusting the universe (to do what? give her even more money for shills like Financial Freedom courses and imported coffee beans?)

In the same way that Ariana Grande‚Äôs blatant lying about plastic surgery has inevitably had an effect on susceptible young girls and women who feel like they will never measure up to an elusive, ephemeral standard of beauty, Rachel‚Äôs never-ending pit of money and support system in her wealthy father + his businesses is what propels her spontaneous life changes and impulse purchases. Both Rakel and Ariana are wealthy white women who grew up with financial security and the means to pursue their dreams. They‚Äôve both leaned a lot into the woo woo stuff which is really a lot of cobbled together traditions that they try to market as spirituality. And I think there‚Äôs a distinct difference between people practicing those alone in their rooms or with groups of witchy friends and those who make a ton of money off of spiritually inclined beliefs or things. Rakel isn‚Äôt at the point of selling crystals, but she would if she could. She would sell anything that she throws to the wall and it sticks, and when she says she‚Äôs ‚Äúinspired,‚Äù it‚Äôs just another money-making scheme she‚Äôs plotting up. It‚Äôs so fucking disappointing.

I think it‚Äôs also important to note that she (and Ariana) have the ability to prioritize spirituality because they have the time, money, and freedom. They get to address their top level of maslow‚Äôs hierarchy. It‚Äôs just not a cute look to flaunt massive purchases in a world full of so much financial disparity.",9,1728065982.0,rachelbrathensnark,0,1.0,False

Depending on the Grind Size, I got a Nimbu Paani (really sour) to an enjoyable sourness (the notes were that of an accented lemon/lime), and it had a very light body. I did not have any tonic or OJ at hand, else I think this would have worked well - complimenting the Tonic's bitterness

  
As per BT, the tasting notes should have Peach, Mosambi, Sugarcane  - I did not find any peach or sugarcane. BT Also suggests a Pour over or french press for this, but I made espresso

Firstly, I have really struggled to write this all down. Our friendship groups are so heavily entwined and it's got so many people involved now. I didn't even know where to start. So much has happened and I'm doing a lot of work on myself after all of this.

I (F26) started talking to my ex, J (M23), in February. We were in the same extended friendship group and I was really worried about dating within the group. I already had an ex in the group, C, who I had dated 5 years ago before he had met my friends through work in a small town (2 years after we split). He had no idea they were my friends until about a year before a wedding we both attended. We‚Äôre now on good terms after a lot of work after a messy split where C cheated on me with his ex at a festival. We don‚Äôt hang out or go for coffee but we do have a chat and get on if we‚Äôre both on a night out. 
From the offset, J pursued me and messaged me. Originally, I‚Äôd thought he was gay but it turned out he wasn‚Äôt. I ended up finally agreeing to a date after our mutual best friend, M (F23) pushed both of us to pursue the developing feelings. We had an amazing first date and we talked all evening. We went on more dates and the topic of spicy sleep started coming up more. I had made it clear that I don‚Äôt sleep with someone until a romantic connection has really been established due to past trauma that made it hard to connect after spicy sleep. He really understood and made me feel completely safe and relaxed with him about it. Our biggest disagreement was arguing over condiments and which are the best. He eats his fries dry and that is truly abhorrent to me. As stupid as it was, it made me laugh and it was like dating my best friend because he was already my friend beforehand. When things started to progress, we finally slept together and it was great! I didn‚Äôt feel sick having him in my bed and he was the first man to stay in my bed after my last boyfriend who caused all my trauma. I‚Äôd told him everything about it, in more details than I had with my any of my friends and he‚Äôd been so understanding and supportive about my issues and the commitment problems I‚Äôve since faced after the severe trauma I experienced.
We started planning further in advance for things. In May, we had two big date nights planned, one was a work event for him and the other was going to an event with friends. My birthday was a few weeks before these things as it is at the beginning of May and I‚Äôd asked if he wanted to come on the day out with my friends. I made it clear that there was no pressure from me to come and I just thought he‚Äôd enjoy the day as a lot of our mutual friends were coming as well as a couple of my friends from uni and childhood. He didn‚Äôt even hesitate when he said yes. Our next date involved us going out for dinner where he started making Christmas plans for me to spend time with his family. I ended up having a minor panic attack at planning so far in advance (we were in mid April at this point) and he stopped immediately once I said I wasn‚Äôt ready to talk that far in advance. We‚Äôd agreed not to sleep with other people after the first time we‚Äôd slept together as we were both serious about our developing relationship, so I thought. 
My birthday came and we had an amazing time- despite the little things that irritated me. He was over an hour late. The boys had gone to the pub whilst I went to brunch with the girls and they all ended up trashed and incredibly late. After a few stern words, they eventually showed up. I had a bit of a wobble about being the centre of attention but J took me off for some time where I was one on one with someone and talked me down from the incoming panic. We rejoined my friends at the pub and he pulled me for a chat about our future. He asked me to be his girlfriend but I told him I wasn‚Äôt quite ready for a label. We then agreed to complete exclusivity where we didn‚Äôt see anyone else anymore and ‚Äòbasically committed without the official label‚Äô according to J. After this, he spent the night chatting to my friends and told our Married Friends that he was going to 'take care of me' and that he was 'serious about me', something they relayed the next day out of happiness and excitement. All of my friends loved him and were so happy for us. We left at 9pm and he stayed the night- something that was becoming more routine. I loved spending time with him and my work colleagues were all enthusiastically rooting for us as I‚Äôd been single for 3.5 years with very little luck in the dating field at all. I was completely smitten with him and starting to see myself falling head over heels in love with him. During our evenings, we'd talk about the days we were having and he expressed his frustrations about his friends. Some of his opinions were questionable, to say the least, and were offensive. I called him out for the most part but, ashamedly, I didn't make it clear enough that he was being mean and shouldn't have said some of these things at all. 
He was going out of the country to a festival with ‚Äòthe boys and M‚Äô a couple of days after my birthday. I had no issues with this until M had asked me how I was so chilled with the situation. I trusted him up until M mentioned me being chill- I am not famous for my chill amongst my friends. When I asked for more details, she explained that his long term bad blood ex, L (F23), and his ex fling, B (F24), were both going as well. He‚Äôd completely omitted this but I just noted it and didn't mention to him I knew as I started to get suspicious. During the week he was away, we‚Äôd gone from speaking every day to no contact at all. I‚Äôd assumed he had no data there but he was viewing all of my social media posts within 10 mins of posting. I knew something was up but I had no evidence. 
Once they were back, I still heard nothing. M came over for dinner and proudly announced that nothing happened when they were away. I didn‚Äôt believe her. I knew something had- I just had no evidence still. Finally- after a drink- I asked to speak to J. He called me and I told him I knew everything so this was his chance to tell me the truth. This was the biggest bluff of my life. He immediately told me that he‚Äôd slept with L whilst they were away. He even followed it up with ‚ÄúI thought about you the whole time‚Äù. Within 5 days of my birthday, he'd slept with her. He didn't even apologise for any of it, not even those bad 'I'm sorry I hurt your feelings' apologies. After some insults hurled from my end, I ended it. I didn‚Äôt cry until I was finally off the phone and M was devastated. M shared a hotel room with L and she had lied about the night she'd spent with J. We had no idea if L knew about me but she lived with one of J's friends so we had assumed she'd known as J had told this guy about us. 
M stayed with me that night as I was a total mess. She's never seen me so upset as I normally have kept it together when things go wrong. She had known J for 10 years and decided to cut him out. We called Married Friends so we could let them know the situation and that I wanted to stay away from J but I wanted them to stay friends if they wanted. I told Married Friends and M that I support their respective friendships with J. Realistically, I didn't want to be that girl who split up the group and I didn't want them to choose between me and him. Surprisingly to me, they all cut him off. They said they all found his actions awful and were appalled by it all, especially after the way he'd acted less than 5 days before with me and all my friends. M and I spoke about it nonstop so I could piece my feelings together and work out where I stood. He'd made it clear that this was premeditated cheating during our break up chat and I couldn't fathom what I'd done to deserve it, to be honest. I'm not perfect, I never pretend to be but I don't think I deserved this. J idolises C and has really lived up to his legacy.
In the weeks that followed, I was egged on to confront L for her part, I reached out to B, who had heard on the grapevine about what had happened. I knew B through J and wanted to get to know her more before everything happened. We met for brunch and she just asked me what happened. I told her everything, sparing most details. She informed me that L had no idea. I was so glad I hadn't confronted L but I had spoken horribly behind her back. I contacted L that night to apologise for the things I'd said and she immediately responded apologising for the part she'd played in everything and asked to meet up. I was hesistant but we ended up going for dinner and drinks within a week.
She told me everything about that night, including the fact he wasn't as intoxicated as he'd made out. He used her grief from losing a parent to angle their closeness and he'd even done something similar to her when they had dated the first time round. She explained about how he has since been saying that I was horrible and controlling which is why he cheated on me.
I had one question for her, realistically. In the month after the split, I'd unpaused my dating apps. On one of them, someone had liked me using my late partners name and photos of us from before his death. I was shaken to my core. Married Friends automatically said they thought J was behind the fake profile. I wasn't sure but they were almost certain. I tore him to shreds on our break up call but surely not enough to warrant this? I needed to know if she thought he was capable of this. L informed me that something similar had happened following their break up but she never knew if it were him. For L, this confirmed it was him who had done this to her. I was devastated. It ended up being a rather lovely eve where I felt connected to my body and she is actually really lovely. We are quite good friends now, in fact!
L had a go at him for his behaviour that evening after leaving, B cut off J as well as her and I hang out so regularly now that she didn't want the negativity he brings around anymore. I heard rumblings that J has since said we weren't together etc so it wasn't cheating and I'm exaggerating. It hurts but I didn't want to keep it going really, those who knew what happened, knew. Those who didn't want to be involved, had my full support. I just wanted to heal and move on, to be honest.
So that brings us to now. He was called out by L's housemate. Housemate met up with J who was acting as if he hadn't done anything wrong. Housemate and I are acquaintances but he is close with L, B and M so he knew everything at this point. Housemate was angry at him for his conduct and told him as such. Made the point that he has split everyone up and everyone is angry. So, J got whiny and upset and sent apologies out. He sent one to M detailing how upset he was about the situation and how he's left it so many months because he was so scared but he's done loads of growth. He sent one to L about how he was sorry for his treatment of her and he is sorry for not telling her the 'details' about the week away. I had been reduced to the details. L had two apologies, M had one. I'm still waiting. Married Friends want apologies for his behaviour and the lying on my birthday because he clearly wasn't serious about me.
I don't think an apology would have changed anything for me, especially one he only sent because he was told off by Housemate, but I do think it would have given me that last bit of closure. 
I don't really know why I shared this but I just think I needed to get it out. It's been months of working on my self worth and just connecting with my friends. Friends and time are the best healers for everything.",4,1728065655.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False
