Also am I really still creeping out these expat women just like how people stereotype Indian men to be?,"So I am a male who turned 24 just a couple of weeks ago and living in the city Bangalore in India but I am a Bengali Indian. I talk with several women in my grad school who are Indians too but so far had no luck and never had a gf. There is this luxurious mall in our city where many foreigners who are expats go there. As Bangalore is the major IT hub of India, many expats do come here. So in the mall, I approached several foreign women who were mostly white women from countries like US, England, Canada, Australia, Germany, Spain etc within 20-35 age range to socialize with them. I don't flirt with them or ask them for a date immediately like in typical cold approaching. I just initiate conversation with them while they are strolling around in the mall or seated in a Cafe/coffee shop within the mall. Most of them were friendly to me and even seemed comfortable.

I would even apologize to check if in case I made them uncomfortable and they say no no you are fine. They smile too and talk and we talk about whether they are working in the city and introduce myself, ask which country they are from, how they are finding the city etc. Unfortunately I don't get to connect further with them on social media like Instagram as either I am hesitant or they say they are in a hurry so don't get the chance. But as I see people criticizing online about cold approaching, will they criticize my way of approaching them as well? Also am I still behaving the same way like people stereotype Indian men as?",1,1736870910.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

We were both excited—after all, it was our first big trip together. The idea of exploring Times Square, strolling through Central Park, and visiting all the iconic spots filled us with anticipation.

The drive to New York was filled with laughter, shared playlists, and talks about our future. But things started to feel off soon after we arrived. She seemed distant, always on her phone, and the excitement we shared on the road started to fade.

One evening, while I was waiting for her in our hotel room, I decided to go for a walk and clear my head. I wandered into a nearby café and grabbed a coffee, trying to shake off the uneasiness. When I returned to the hotel, I saw her through the lobby window—she was with someone else, looking far too comfortable for my liking.

My heart sank, and I confronted her right there. It turned out she had been seeing someone else before our trip, and she decided to meet him in NYC. Betrayed and devastated, I couldn’t believe she would do this to me.

That night, I made a tough decision. I packed my things, took the car keys, and left her there in the hotel. As I drove back home alone, I couldn’t help but question my actions. Did I do the right thing by leaving her there? Should I have handled it differently?

The drive back gave me plenty of time to think. Part of me felt guilty for leaving her stranded, but another part felt justified. She broke my trust and ruined what was supposed to be a memorable trip. Maybe it was harsh, but I needed to put myself first in that moment.

Now, every time I think back to that trip, I’m reminded of how betrayal feels and how important it is to surround yourself with people who genuinely care about you.",3,1736870884.0,AmITheJerk,0,1.0,False

1i19ews,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1i19ews/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_sister_bring_her_dog/,AITA for refusing to let my sister bring her dog into my home or meet her man's sister?,"I (38 F) refused my sister's (28 F), we will refer to her as J, request to bring her dog in our home or meet her boyfriend's sister and this set into motion a series of events that resulted in her cutting me out of her life FOREVER. (Im posting this again after editing, the comments said it was too long)

Now before all the doggy lovers get enraged I am going to give some context. My husband and I live with my elderly mother and we are both immune compromised (Lyme disease). So we have never had dogs in the home, although we have had strictly indoor cats in the past. We have both suffered with very bad infections and are extremely careful with cleanliness because Im prone to skin infection. So we keep the house clean clean clean. When I visit my friends they usually just stop their dogs from jumping on me to avoid any scratches (which has ended me up in the emergency room once before with strep/staff). But our space our boundaries, this is what makes us feel safe in our own space and J knows how serious it can be.

SO, back to the doggo incident of 2022, J knows why we can't have dogs around us. Now please understand I don't hate dogs, I find them cute and have compassion for all animals but we don't even have our own pets (and trust me I want fur babies desperately but this is our rather sad reality), so when I said no (gently mind you) and reminded her that we simply cant she started begging and pleading, she put on the big puppy dog eyes and they were brimmed with tears. My mom and I were both shocked, I had never seen her behave like this and found it very manipulative and really selfish. I said no again, firmly this time, but not in a mean way. She pouted heavily and kept pushing. We are not exactly close, but I still expect people to respect other people's boundaries with their own homes.

In the same conversation we were discussing her housewarming and it had been decided that they would have a housewarming for his family and my mom, and we would go to the house warming the night after which she was having for her friends. The reason? Well his sister (Lets call her R) never having met me, decided that she would anounce how she was going to 'crush' me while punching her palm again and again... in front of my mother (she found out we had conflicting opinions about Yoga, which I studied to become a teacher, it works for some, others it can cause hip problems from overstretching, its very spiritual and as I have Hindu friends who use it as a form of worship I respect it from a whole other space... not just some excercise... a bit much of a reaction yeah?).

So it was decided that I would give R a wide berth until such time as my sister's relationship was secure with her man, ideally once they were engaged. My sister then said she wanted my husand and I to attend his birthday at his mother's house the weekend after the house warming, where R would be. Which defeats the purpose of not going to the house warming and avoiding being 'crushed', a possible phsyical fight with someone who seems to want to get into with me, and maybe ruining my sister's relationship before it had a chance, besides, I don't want drama like that, I just don't have the spoons for it (fellow spoonies will understand). BUT I did tell her hubs and I would be thrilled to take her and her man for dinner for his birthday and I'd be happy to meet his family once they are engaged. Well... we were excluded from the second housewarming too as she decided to invite R to it so 'she didn't feel left out', they share a boundary wall so R can see all comings and going and can even see straight into J's kitchen from hers.

Now some more context, my sister, J, has never come to my housewarmings or birthdays or any special occasions in our adult lives. She has refused invitations to coffee and dinner with me or to even speak on the phone or text etc. So when all of this went down with trying to force the dog into our home and then trying to force meeting her then boyfriend's family she had already made it clear that she did not like me or want a relationship with me so I felt like she was using me to make her look good and give the impression of the happy family, which we were not.

So now, more than 2 years later, Im still blocked and exocmmunicado for refusing to let her bring her dog into our hom or meet R... but KARMA had plans of her own.

Within a year of moving in R turned on J in a spectacular way and tried to 'crush' her even threatening to F her up. After picking a fight with J's friend and J not taking sides, R took it as a massive slight and announced to J that she would break her and her man up. She turned the entire family against J, went on a smear campaign and loosed the flying monkeys that included the step father, mother, sisters and their friends, and did everything in their power to break them up as a collective, and guess what... they still have to see each other driving in and out, share a boundary wall and for a long time dance around the insanity of people I can only describe as rabid as they contiue to harass, pitch up at her house unanounced, bad mouth and treat her like a second class citizen. She still refuses to speak to me, even though I have tried to reach out a few times (at my parents request) and it really but I have made peace with it, but my mom battles.

AITA? Should I have just let the dog come OCD cleaned to keep her happy, cos I feel like she was just testing boundaries to see how far she could get me to bend to please her? Should I have gone to the house warming and let the sister crush me?",1,1736870788.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

Probationary Constable Peter Grant dreams of being a detective in London’s Metropolitan Police. Too bad his superior plans to assign him to the Case Progression Unit, where the biggest threat he’ll face is a paper cut. But Peter’s prospects change in the aftermath of a puzzling murder, when he gains exclusive information from an eyewitness who happens to be a ghost. Peter’s ability to speak with the lingering dead brings him to the attention of Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Nightingale, who investigates crimes involving magic and other manifestations of the uncanny. Now, as a wave of brutal and bizarre murders engulfs the city, Peter is plunged into a world where gods and goddesses mingle with mortals and a long-dead evil is making a comeback on a rising tide of magic.

**My thoughts while reading it**  
  
***Ben Aaronovitch’s Rivers of London is a vibrant introduction to a magical version of modern-day London, where the fantastical and the real merge seamlessly. The book combines urban fantasy with police procedural elements, delivering a witty, fast-paced story set against the backdrop of one of the world’s most iconic cities. While the novel shines in its imaginative premise and clever use of its setting, certain narrative flaws hold it back from reaching its full potential.***  
  
The story begins when Peter Grant, a rookie constable in the Metropolitan Police, encounters a ghost during a murder investigation. This discovery leads him into a hidden world of magic, ghosts, and supernatural creatures. Taken under the wing of Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Nightingale, the last practicing wizard in Britain, Peter begins to unravel the mysteries of magical London while learning the art of wizardry himself.  
  
One of the most exciting aspects of Rivers of London is how Aaronovitch integrates the magical with the real. The story takes place in a fully recognizable London, and the author’s deep knowledge of the city shines through on every page. Landmarks like Covent Garden, the Thames, and even lesser-known neighbourhoods are not just settings but active participants in the narrative. By weaving magic into the everyday life of the city, Aaronovitch creates a world that feels both fantastical and grounded. What makes this setting particularly compelling is how much you learn about London while reading. From its history and architecture to its geography and culture, the book is a treasure trove of London trivia. The anthropomorphized river gods—like Mama Thames, who rules the lower river, and Father Thames, who controls the upper stretches—are tied to the city’s geography in clever and inventive ways. These magical figures not only enrich the narrative but also highlight the importance of the Thames to London’s identity. It’s a book that celebrates the city’s quirks, contradictions, and hidden stories, offering readers a chance to see London through a new and enchanting lens.  
  
Peter Grant is an engaging protagonist whose mix of dry humour and scientific curiosity makes him a likeable guide through this magical world. His perspective as a mixed-race Londoner adds a unique layer to the narrative, allowing for moments of cultural insight and humour. However, Peter’s rapid acceptance of magic feels rushed and robs the story of what could have been a fascinating internal conflict. The ease with which he transitions from sceptical constable to apprentice wizard feels unrealistic, making his journey less impactful than it could have been.  
  
The supporting characters, on the other hand, are a delight. Thomas Nightingale, Peter’s enigmatic mentor, is an especially compelling figure. His old-world charm, stoic demeanour, and hints of a mysterious past add a richness to the story that often outshines Peter’s straightforward character. I found myself wishing the story had been told from Nightingale’s perspective instead. An older character with years of magical experience, countless secrets, and a unique view of London’s magical history would have made for a much more intriguing protagonist. His internal struggles, shaped by decades of solitude and responsibility, could have offered a depth that Peter’s more lighthearted narrative occasionally lacks. Nightingale’s role as a mentor is effective, but as the story unfolds, it feels like he was better suited for the lead role. The river gods, particularly the fiery Mama Thames and her family, are among the book’s most memorable characters. Even minor characters, like Molly the creepy housekeeper, bring humour and a sense of mystery that enrich the narrative.  
  
Despite its strong world-building, the novel struggles with pacing. The story alternates between gripping magical events and abrupt transitions to mundane scenes, such as Peter discussing paperwork or grabbing coffee. These shifts often undercut the tension and leave key moments feeling unresolved. For instance, an intense supernatural encounter might end suddenly, with little reflection or follow-up, which can frustrate readers looking for more narrative depth. Aaronovitch’s prose is light and conversational, filled with humour that makes the book a quick and entertaining read. Peter’s witty commentary is one of the book’s highlights, though there are moments when the humour feels misplaced and detracts from the story’s emotional stakes.  
  
What sets Rivers of London apart is its ability to turn the city itself into a character. Aaronovitch’s love for London is evident in his detailed descriptions and creative use of its landmarks. For readers familiar with the city, the book offers a magical reimagining of familiar places. For those less acquainted, it’s an opportunity to explore London in a way that feels both educational and fantastical. By the end of the book, you’ll likely find yourself wanting to visit the city—or at least look up its rivers and hidden histories.  
  
While Rivers of London is an imaginative and entertaining read, it doesn’t quite reach its full potential. The rushed character development and uneven pacing prevent it from being as impactful as it could have been. However, its unique setting and creative world-building make it worth exploring, particularly for fans of urban fantasy or anyone with an interest in London itself. In the end, Rivers of London is an enjoyable and inventive detour into a magical version of the real world. It’s not perfect, but its charm, humour, and richly realized setting make it a story that lingers in your mind long after the final page. For those who love London—or want to learn more about it—this book offers a fresh, fantastical perspective on a city that has inspired countless stories.

1i19dbv,https://i.redd.it/kcl8dlo8gzce1.png,The Art of Waiting: Why Impatience Can Be Your Greatest Challenge • [Click to Expand] ,"## From Frustration to Freedom: How to Embrace Patience in a Fast-Paced World



Impatience is a sneaky thing, isn’t it? It creeps up on us when the traffic light turns red, when a webpage takes a second too long to load, or when life refuses to deliver the results we desperately want—right now. We live in a world wired for speed, from instant noodles to same-day delivery. While this convenience is great, it has made us terrible at waiting. But here’s the thing: impatience doesn’t just make us grumble while standing in line—it’s a feeling that can affect almost every corner of our lives.

### The Real Cost of Impatience

Let’s be honest: impatience feels awful. Your chest tightens, your mind races, and there’s this little voice in your head screaming, “Hurry up already!” It’s more than just annoying; it’s a ripple that disrupts the calm waters of our lives.

Think about relationships, for instance. Imagine a friend who’s always interrupting you mid-sentence because they can’t bear to wait their turn. Or a family member who’s short-tempered during holiday preparations. Impatience in these situations doesn’t just create awkward moments—it strains the bonds of trust and understanding. People might feel unheard or undervalued, and over time, that can damage even the strongest relationships.

Then there’s work. Picture this: you’re eager to impress your boss, so you rush through a project to get it done quickly. But in your haste, you miss key details, and your work ends up looking sloppy. Impatience, in this case, can hinder your career growth. Employers value thoroughness and thoughtfulness, and an impulsive decision can overshadow your hard work.

And let’s not forget about our mental health. Impatience fuels stress and anxiety, leading to that dreaded fight-or-flight response. Elevated cortisol levels? Check. Tight shoulders? Absolutely. It’s a physiological chain reaction that leaves us feeling more drained than energized. What’s worse, impatience robs us of joy. Instead of enjoying the journey, we fixate on the destination, blind to the small victories and moments of beauty along the way.

### A Personal Wake-Up Call

I’ll never forget the time I tried to bake bread for the first time. It was supposed to be this meditative, fulfilling process—kneading the dough, letting it rise, and savoring the scent of freshly baked bread. But no. I kept poking the dough, impatient to see if it had risen enough, and ended up with a flat, dense loaf that tasted like cardboard. That experience taught me something crucial: some things simply can’t be rushed. Bread needs time to rise, just like our goals, our relationships, and even our personal growth.

### Why Are We So Impatient?

To tackle impatience, we first need to understand it. At its core, impatience is a clash between expectation and reality. We expect the line at the coffee shop to move quickly, or our career to take off within a year, or a new skill to come naturally on the first try. When reality doesn’t match these expectations, frustration sets in.

Technology plays a huge role here. We’re used to instant gratification—streaming movies, Googling answers, and swiping right for potential partners. This constant access to “quick fixes” rewires our brains, making us less tolerant of delays.

But impatience isn’t just a modern problem. It’s deeply human. We’re wired to seek efficiency, to conserve energy, and to avoid wasting time. The trick is learning to balance this instinct with the understanding that not everything in life can—or should—happen immediately.

### Turning Impatience Into Patience

So, how do we stop impatience from running the show? Here are some practical steps:

1. **Set Realistic Expectations**  
   One of the biggest drivers of impatience is setting ourselves up for disappointment. If you expect to master yoga in a week or see instant results from a new fitness routine, you’re bound to feel frustrated. Instead, break your goals into smaller, manageable steps. Celebrate progress, no matter how small—it’s still progress.

2. **Reframe Waiting as a Gift**  
   Waiting doesn’t have to be wasted time. Think of it as a pause button in your busy life. Stuck in traffic? Use the moment to listen to an audiobook or reflect on your day. In a long line? Practice gratitude for the things you already have. When you shift your perspective, waiting becomes less of an obstacle and more of an opportunity.

3. **Practice Mindfulness and Meditation**  
   Mindfulness is like a superpower for battling impatience. It helps you stay present, even when you’re itching to move on to the next thing. Try this: the next time you feel impatient, take a deep breath and focus on your surroundings. Notice the colors, sounds, and textures around you. This simple exercise can anchor you in the moment and calm your restless mind.

4. **Embrace the Process**  
   There’s a reason why the old saying goes, “Good things come to those who wait.” True growth, whether it’s in your career, relationships, or personal development, takes time. Trust the process. Remember, even a diamond starts as a lump of coal under pressure.

### The Bigger Picture: Patience as a Virtue

Patience isn’t just about waiting calmly—it’s about resilience, perspective, and faith. It’s trusting that life unfolds in its own time, even when we can’t see the bigger picture. Take gardening, for example. You plant a seed, water it, and wait. You can’t force it to sprout faster, but when it finally blooms, the reward is all the sweeter.

This mindset doesn’t just reduce stress; it also makes us more compassionate. When we’re patient, we’re better listeners, more understanding friends, and kinder strangers. We stop rushing through life and start truly living it.

### Final Thoughts

Impatience might feel like a harmless quirk, but it’s a thief. It steals our peace, strains our relationships, and blinds us to life’s simple pleasures. The good news? It’s a habit we can unlearn. By setting realistic expectations, practicing mindfulness, and embracing the journey, we can transform impatience into patience—and in doing so, unlock a deeper sense of fulfillment.

So the next time you’re stuck waiting, remember: life isn’t a race. Take a deep breath, look around, and savor the moment. Who knows? You might just find that the art of waiting is one of life’s greatest teachers.

Ever feel like your brain is a kitten chasing laser pointers when you're trying to focus? 👀✨ Same here! So, what's a daily ritual that helps me stay on track and work smarter, not harder? Let me spill the tea. Or coffee. ☕️

**The Power Hour: My Secret Sauce 💪**

I call it my ""Power Hour,"" but here’s the kicker—it doesn’t always start at a strict time. Why? Because life gets in the way, and strict schedules make me feel like I’m in boot camp. Anyone else feel me?

**Here's how it goes down:**

1. **Morning Mojo Brew:** First, coffee. Not just any coffee, but the kind that makes me feel like I could conquer mountains. Already making progress, right? 😉

2. **Top 3 List:** It's like a grocery list but for my brain. Only three tasks. Not twenty. Not seventeen. Just three things I need to crush today. Keeps the overwhelm at bay.

3. **The ""Unplugged"" Zone:** For this hour, I become an internet ghost. No WiFi, just me and my tasks. Imagine a world where cats can’t distract you on social media… beautiful, isn't it?

4. **Beat Sync:** I pop on headphones and blast my ""Focus Bangers"" playlist. Classical, lo-fi, even some epic movie scores. Basically, anything that makes me feel like I'm scoring a scene in an action movie.

5. **A Victory Dance:** No kidding, once I hit that third task, it's time for a tiny dance party. 😂 Keeps me motivated and reminds my brain that I'm a boss!

Is it perfect? Nope. Sometimes I end up falling down a YouTube rabbit hole anyway. I mean, can you blame me when videos of puppies learning to swim exist? 🐶

**But here's the magic:** Even when the day doesn’t go as planned, sticking to this ritual brings focus back to the chaos. It’s like my mini-reset button. 

What about you all? Do you have a ritual that makes you feel like a productivity wizard? ⚡️ Let’s keep the good vibes and ideas rolling!

Stay awesome,

That being said, has anyone experimented with taking their meds much later in the day to try and benefit from any stimulation it provides in a social setting?

Currently at 60mg Meflynate (likely on 80mg when this comes around). I seem to peak around 11-2pm when taking my dose at 8am, with them leaving my system noticeably around 6pm onwards. So a (very) vague 3 hours up, 3 hours peak, 3 hours down.

In such a fast-paced world, it’s easy to overlook the importance of your physical and mental well-being. However, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can significantly boost your trading performance. Here’s how proper nutrition and exercise can help you stay on top of your game.

**Nutrition: Fuel for Your Mind**

Your brain is your most valuable tool in trading. To keep it functioning at its best, you need the right fuel.

**1. Start with a Power Breakfast.**

A well-rounded breakfast provides energy for the day ahead. Opt for oatmeal, eggs, whole-grain toast with avocado, and some nuts. These foods are rich in complex carbs and healthy fats, giving you sustained energy.

**2. Smart Snacks.**

Avoid heavy, greasy foods that can make you sluggish. Instead, snack on fruits, nuts, yogurt, or protein bars to maintain steady blood sugar levels and focus.

**3. Balanced Lunch.**

Keep your midday meal light yet satisfying. Grilled chicken or fish with quinoa and steamed vegetables is a perfect choice, offering protein and essential nutrients.

**4. Stay Hydrated.**

Dehydration can impair cognitive function. Drink water throughout the day, and consider swapping out some coffee for herbal teas or lemon water to keep stress levels in check.

**Exercise: Energize Your Body and Mind**

Regular physical activity is a powerful tool to reduce stress, enhance focus, and build endurance for the long trading days.

**1. Cardio Workouts.**

Activities like running, cycling, swimming, or even brisk walking boost circulation and oxygenate your brain. Aim for 30 minutes of cardio 3-4 times a week.

**2. Strength Training.**

Lifting weights or doing bodyweight exercises keeps your body toned and resilient, which is crucial for maintaining energy and good posture during long hours of trading.

**3. Yoga and Meditation.**

Trading can be stressful, so incorporating yoga and mindfulness practices into your routine can improve mental clarity and emotional stability. Even a 10-minute meditation before your trading session can help you stay focused and composed.

**Discipline: Balancing Trading and Health**

Maintaining a healthy lifestyle as a trader takes discipline, but it’s worth the effort.

* Plan Your Meals. Prepare healthy meals in advance to avoid resorting to unhealthy options during a busy day.
* Schedule Workouts. Treat exercise like an important meeting and stick to the schedule.

I made the decision to buy Huel as I've started trying to get in better shape, and thought it made more sense to use than trying to get protein shakes in throughout the day.

I ordered the Coffee Caramel Black Edition as I saw many people recommended it. 

I'm trying it for the first time today and am not a fan. It's naturally quite grainy despite using a Nutri Bullet, which I understand is expected in a product like this and can overlook that.

The flavour to me is vile. To the point where I am close to gagging if I take a large sip. I tried to add a shot of espresso to help, but it hasn't at all. I know flavour is subjective, but has anyone had a similar experience?

My brain registered that the waiter had whipped out a knife only after I had automatically recoiled from him, sliding further into the booth. Without conscious thought, I picked up and flicked the steaming cup of coffee at his face. 

The knife slashed past my face, missing my eye by a hair’s breadth. I thought I saw an eyelash fall. The waiter screamed as the brown liquid plastered his face, and dropped the knife. 

I stared wildly around. There were only two other guests in the diner. They seemed rooted to their seats. A chef stood at the kitchen window, frozen mid plating, garnish still in hand.  None of them seemed to be in any hurry to help.  

I was trapped in the booth by the window, and had the option of trying to climb over the high backed seats to the booth behind, or to clamber over the table to make a leap to the next booth in front. 

The waiter stopped clawing at his face in those short seconds. He flailed his arms out at me as I sprung up onto the seats. He missed, and I yelped as I leapt onto the table, then attempted to springboard past him. 

Still half blinded, the waiter turned and grabbed something off the ground. The knife. Damn it. 

He swung back around, and I prepared myself to leap from his reach. A shot rang out, accompanied by the shattering of glass.

I ducked, falling to my knees. I swivelled my head, desperately trying to spot where the shot had come from. 

There was a thud by my side.

The waiter had collapsed to the ground. The back of his head was a clumpy red and grey mess. An acrid, metallic scent, tinged with gunpowder, enveloped the place.

Screams. It took me a while to realise I was a contributing instrument to the symphony of screams. 

The police arrived shortly after. They didn’t know who had shot my assailant. I certainly didn’t have a gun on me, and had three witnesses to vouch for my innocence. 

They assumed a passerby had intervened and run, for fear of repercussions for shooting a man dead, justifiable or not. 

No one on the streets witnessed the shooting. Or so they said, when asked by the police .

I think I puked at some point. I don’t think I’ll ever forget the way the gooey, lumpy substance had trickled out his head and down the sides of his body. 

The police had no idea why he had attacked me, what my would-be-murderer’s motivations were. They didn’t even know who the waiter was. He had apparently appeared out of nowhere with a fake identity, and taken the job as waiter just a few days before I dropped in for my usual coffee and cake breakfast. 

I didn't leave my house for two days. When I finally did, it was for a crisis at work. Something I had to personally deal with.  I was terrified the whole journey. Every little thing made me jump. I made sure to mind my own business, and kept my eyes averted from others.

I was almost at the entrance to my office building when a car pulled up next to me. I was so relieved at finally reaching my destination, that I didn’t notice the window in the passenger’s side wind down, didn’t notice the gun pointed straight at me, didn’t see the face of the person holding the gun. 

Not until another car rammed into the back of that car, and the shot went wide. 

As the bullet struck the concrete wall behind me, missing my head by a couple of inches, I stared straight at the shooter. Their face was covered by a mask, one of those cheap white masks with eye holes that you could buy at any party store. I saw them curse, then turn to aim the gun at me for another shot.

Their head exploded. One moment I was looking into hard eyes gleaming through the white mask, next there was a headless neck perched on lifeless shoulders, blood splattered all over the dashboard and seats. The body slumped forward.

I found myself joining in the cacophony of screaming, once again. 

Before I could recover my wits, someone grabbed me from behind, and a cloth was pressed over my mouth and nose. I struggled as they dragged me to the car, the one that had rammed into the first car and ended up saving my life.

They hadn’t even slammed the door shut after me when I passed out. 

I awoke to darkness. I was still in a state too groggy, too out of it to panic, when I heard a voice. The odd robotic timbre made it clear a modulator was being used.

“You need to stay here. It’s to keep you safe. It’s just for a short while.”

I didn’t respond. My tongue felt swollen and dry, like a dust ball had enveloped it. 

“We will not harm you. It’s our duty to keep you safe.”

That was all that was said. 

I raised my head off the ground, and sat up. I was relieved to find that I wasn’t bound or tied. 

Who the hell could have done this? They said they were keeping me safe, but they had basically kidnapped me. But who would kidnap me? Was it one of my recent one night stands? Did I offend anyone on a date? Was it a bitter work colleague, an angry ex? I couldn’t think of anyone I could possibly have offended enough to be kidnapped for. Or attacked at knife and gun point, for that matter.

Minutes passed in the unlit room, then hours. The darkness was absolute, the silence unyielding, punctuated only by my panicked breaths. The air was stale, a mix of sweat, earth and disinfectant. 

Respite from the isolation came only in brief interludes whenever I was fed. 

A little rectangle of light would appear at the door, followed by a tray of food slid through to me. 

I refused to eat food I could not see, and so they would turn on the lights for five minutes while I ate. 

There was a loo in the room, which I could freely use, though the darkness made it hard to navigate. I tried to go only when the light was still on. 

Besides the meals, nothing. At some point, at my desperate pleas, they said I would be released in a matter of days. But time in that dark room stretched endlessly. The wait between meals felt like forever. It’s surprising how agonisingly slow time passes when you have nothing to engage your mind with. No phones, no books, no chatter, nothing. 

I began to suspect they were torturing me, in some sick psychological way. 

I began to wonder if that was it, for the rest of my life. Trapped in darkness. Alone. 

When nothing changed after the ninth meal (I counted), I ignored the tenth meal. I stayed unmoving, ignoring the lights and the tray that slid into the room. I didn’t bother to slide the tray out when instructed to. 

By the fifteenth meal that I had ignored, I heard voices outside the door. I pretended to be fast asleep, and didn’t stir. It was easy to lay still. I had barely moved since I started skipping meals. I was consumed by hunger and thirst. All I could think about was a tall glass of iced lemonade and eating peanut butter from the jar. 

“We need to let her go,” I heard someone say. It wasn’t in the modulated voice. It sounded like a woman. “She’s not eating. She could die at this rate. She’s been passed out for the last half a day.”

“It’s not safe yet,” a man’s voice responded. “We haven’t caught all of them.”

“It’s one guy. One guy escaped. He’s probably busy fleeing. And we’ve locked down their time door.” 

“You think there aren’t others? For fuck’s sake, she’s the Butcher’s mother. There’s gonna be others keen to end her.” The exasperation was clear in the man’s voice.

“But we’ve stopped the only group with access to a time door,” the woman snapped. “What do you need, to lock her up for years as we hunt down every single person who might try to take her out? We might as well end her ourselves.” The woman snapped. 

“Would that be so bad? It would save hundreds of lives.” the man asked. 

“Stop it. She’s innocent. She’s not her son. And it’s our job to keep the timeline intact. We cannot let history change. You know what could happen.”

“She did produce a monster,” the man retorted. Then he sighed. “I get it, okay? I know my duty. It’s just…I see why they’re trying.”

There was silence after that. 

I was left alone once again, except for the meals I ignored. I was finally certain. I had been kidnapped by a bunch of crazies. I had no son, and was a proud, card-carrying member of the child-free club.

I ignored three more meals before I heard their voices once again. This time, through the modulator. 

I could barely focus through the fog of deprivation. 

“The door will be unlocked in 10 minutes. You will be free to leave then.”

I didn’t speak.. I didn’t trust them. It could all be a cruel joke, to give me false hope. 

“Others will be coming for you,” the voice spoke again. “You have to be very careful, take all precautions to stay safe.” 

That was all. A while later, there was a click at the door. I struggled to my feet, and almost passed out when static encroached my vision. I pushed past the weakness and dizziness. and made my way to the door. To my immense relief, it opened when I twisted the knob. 

I won’t bore you with details of how I made it home. But I made it home safe, and made a police report once I had choked down some food and water. No one tells you how much difficulty, how much stomach-twisting pain you would feel eating and drinking again after days of fasting. I sure as hell never tried to fast before, and never will again. 

The police were, once again, useless. I directed them to where I had been held, but they gleaned nothing from the room or the surrounding area. There was not a single evidence or clue to be found. They concluded that I had been kidnapped by a bunch of mentally unwell people, and that they were also behind the attacks. 

The officers told me they would be in touch once they had more to go on, and that my house would be under surveillance for my protection. I would also be escorted to work for the foreseeable future. 

I took a week off work, to recover from the whole ordeal. Or try to, at least. It was a mind-screw, to say the least. I couldn’t make sense of anything that had happened. Even in the safety of my home, I was drowning in fear. Every little sound made me start, and reach for my baseball bat.

My period of starvation also made it hard for me to consume food and drinks again. I puked several times when I tried to eat, and it was hard for me to keep water down. 

It was only after a fourth morning of nausea when I called the officers parked in front of my house to escort me to the convenience store. I needed to be sure. 

Once I was alone in the house with my purchase, the officers back to surveillance duties, I peed on the stick I bought.

I didn't really make much of an effort to make many friends at college (I graduated just before the break up) because of homework, work, and allocating time for gf.

I just don't know how to ask her out. Do I just text her to ask to go for coffee? What would she think of a random acquaintance (who doesn't even go to her school anymore) asking to meet up with her?

1i198tg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Immunology/comments/1i198tg/cell_tracer_violet_issues/,Cell Tracer Violet Issues,"Fellow academic here. Recently tried to run an experiment where we isolate CD8+ T cells from one mouse strain and adoptively transfer them into mice of another strain. We took 8 mice (aged 8 weeks), isolated ~600 million splenocytes and used a commercially available CD8+ T cell enrichment kit to get ~45 million CD8+ T cells. I then stained them using CellTrace Violet according to the manufacturer (I have been using it this way for three years now, just not this many cells - usually 8-10 million) by using 1ul/1mL/1 million cells - ie: 45 uL of CellTrace into 45mL containing 45 million cells. After 20 minutes of staining I washed twice with PBS, resuspended and counted. I ended up with 12 million cells, not enough to do the adoptive transfer. From reading and consulting with other researchers, I either overlabeled the cells or aspirated the pellet at some point. I am leaning towards the former as a colleague uses this same CellTrace Violet but at 0.5 uL/1mL/20 million cells - meaning I could have (very much) overlabeled them and thus caused this massive loss as we know there is *some* loss with this dye. Usually I see about 1-2million cells lost. When running this experiment last time, we went from 54 million CD8+ T cells to 20 million, which is why I think I just overlabeled and killed them all. Theoretically I could have aspirated the pellet but I have been doing this splenocyte isolation with CD8+ T cells and CellTrace for years without aspirating the pellet. Any thoughts?

Hey there!

So, picture this: I’ve just landed in Istanbul—new city, new adventures, and, most importantly, new people to meet. That’s where you (hopefully) come in!

A little about me: I’m a teacher, which means I spend most of my time trying to make teenagers love literature (or at least tolerate it). I’m slightly obsessed with books, words, and stories—hence why I’m about to dive into a master’s program in literature here in Istanbul. It’s the perfect mix of “dream big” and “let’s study in coffee shops while pretending to be in a rom-com.”

When I’m not geeking out over my favorite authors, I’m usually hunting for the best cup of coffee, exploring new places, or perfecting the art of awkwardly trying to speak Turkish. Spoiler alert: I’m terrible, but I’ve nailed ordering tea.

If you’re up for swapping stories, exploring this amazing city, or just having a good laugh, let’s connect. I promise, I’m great at conversation—my students even roll their eyes at how much I talk, so that’s saying something!

Looking forward to meeting someone who loves Istanbul as much as I’m about to!

Every second I spend in the house is horrible, she puts me down all the time, insults me for no reason, she tells her boyfriend and his kids how bad I am, even tho they told her that I act normal when I’m with them and don’t see why do I behave like that with her, who knows what she says to them, but whatever it is it has pulled me away, nobody invites me to their dinners, coffee or nothing, and when I ask why didn’t you invite me, she would say “Because you don’t know how to behave”. 

 I don’t have words, she constantly tells me how my behaviour is bad and I’m failing and I’m “retarded” and throws in comments how she wished I turned out different etc.

Now, I’m a third year IT student, I don’t drink, don’t do drugs or smoke, I don’t party and never did when I was a teen, never stayed up late out, really don’t understand it anymore, she just does not like me, I don’t think it has anything to do with me, I literally would be sitting on the couch and she would shush me away, I would be smiling and telling her something and she would make an annoyed face and say “Go to your room, leave me alone”.

I hate her so much, she isn’t interested in my life at all, and when I tell her nice things I’m planning like that me and my boyfriend of two years are going to get married after we graduate, she would make comments how he doesn’t love me that much and keeps me to entertain cuz if he did love me he would marry me right away, which isn’t even what both of us agreed. Consantly makes comments and “jokes” how when will I just get married and leave, when will I move out, the joke “I’ll throw a party when u get married and move out”.

As someone living in Helsinki, I kept missing cool events (like Lux Festival) and losing track of places I wanted to visit. You know the struggle - that cool café someone recommended ends up buried in your phone somewhere between screenshots and random bookmarks.

So I built a simple tool to solve this, especially useful for:

* Keeping track of all those interesting spots from Helsinki food markets to hidden coffee shops
* Getting notified about relevant events (from Lux to Flow Festival to small gallery openings)
* Actually remembering to visit the places you save

Especially useful if you:

* Often hear about events after they happened
* Have a list of Helsinki spots scattered across your notes app
* Want to explore more of the city

Would love to hear your thoughts! What features would make this useful for exploring Helsinki? Early access is available at https://getplanlist.com.

I decided late November that it was time to quit. Typically in the past I’d stop for a few days and then I’d cave in and buy a pack a few days later. My cravings were insane as well. This time around, I decided to cut alcohol out of my life, and replace the morning zyn with a coffee or a Bubbl’r. This helps IMMENSELY. Having something to look forward to other than a Zyn is seriously key in quitting. I also decided that being California sober is best for myself. I can still have a little vice whenever I want to have fun. I truly believe the small 2.5 mg gummies I have been taking occasionally has helped to curb my cravings for nicotine. 

What I’ve noticed since quitting: 

• No longer fatigued. I used to lay in bed all day, depressed, felt like I could barely do anything at all. Not anymore! Now I almost have insomnia and I am eager to start the day in the morning without feeling groggy. 
• Sex drive is increased - I swear Zyns made my libido sooooo low. Now it is starting to come back 
• No more ANXIETY! This is a huge one. I spent months out of my life visiting the doctor because I was convinced I had cancer or something detrimental. I’d spend hours researching random symptoms. I no longer do this and I feel so free. 
• Irritability - I would get so irritable without them that it would start to ruin my relationship with my fiancé. He also felt this way, hence why he quit them too. 
• No more GERD & stomach issues. I wouldn’t eat due to nicotine suppressing my appetite, but when I did oh boy the acid reflux was HELL. Now I barely notice it unless I eat very acidic foods.
• Overall mood stability. My moods feel more controlled and I feel happier and more grateful in general. 

So to anyone trying to quit, give yourself grace, reward yourself with other things, and don’t allow yourself the time to think about your cravings. You can do it! ❤️",3,1736869855.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False

Are you looking to maintain that stunning, bright smile after a professional teeth whitening treatment? Proper post-whitening care is crucial to preserving your results and protecting your dental health. Many people don't realize that the hours and days immediately following a teeth whitening procedure are critical for achieving optimal outcomes. Your teeth are more porous and sensitive during this time, making careful brushing and maintenance essential for long-lasting, brilliant results.

Understanding Post-Teeth Whitening Care

After investing time and money into teeth whitening, you want to ensure you're taking the right steps to maintain your beautiful smile. The immediate aftermath of a whitening treatment requires special attention and a gentle approach to oral hygiene.

Why Brushing Matters After Teeth Whitening

Proper brushing technique is crucial after teeth whitening for several reasons:

- Protects newly whitened tooth enamel
- Prevents staining and discoloration
- Maintains overall oral hygiene
- Reduces tooth sensitivity
- Extends the longevity of your whitening results

Recommended Brushing Techniques After Whitening

Wait Before Brushing

**Timing is everything** when it comes to brushing after teeth whitening. Dental professionals recommend waiting at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before brushing your teeth after a professional whitening treatment. This waiting period allows your tooth enamel to remineralize and close the pores that opened during the whitening process.

Choosing the Right Toothbrush and Toothpaste

Select a soft-bristled toothbrush to minimize irritation and potential damage to sensitive teeth. Look for toothpastes specifically designed for:

1. Sensitive teeth
2. Post-whitening care
3. Gentle cleaning
4. Enamel protection

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Gentle Brushing Technique

Use a **gentle circular motion** when brushing, avoiding aggressive scrubbing that could damage your newly whitened teeth. Apply light pressure and focus on thorough but careful cleaning.

Foods and Drinks to Avoid After Whitening

The first 48 hours after teeth whitening are critical for maintaining your results. Avoid:

- Dark-colored beverages (coffee, red wine, cola)
- Highly pigmented foods
- Acidic foods
- Tobacco products

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Maintaining Long-Term Whitening Results

Consistent oral hygiene is key to preserving your bright smile:

- Brush twice daily
- Floss regularly
- Use whitening toothpaste occasionally
- Schedule regular dental check-ups
- Consider touch-up whitening treatments

Addressing Tooth Sensitivity

Many people experience increased sensitivity after teeth whitening. To manage this:

- Use toothpaste for sensitive teeth
- Avoid extreme temperatures
- Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
- Consider fluoride treatments

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Professional Recommendations

Dentists typically suggest the following post-whitening care:

- Wait 30-60 minutes before brushing
- Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
- Choose gentle, non-abrasive toothpaste
- Maintain good oral hygiene habits

When to Consult a Dental Professional

If you experience:
- Prolonged sensitivity
- Unusual pain
- Unexpected discoloration
- Concerns about your whitening results

Contact your dentist for personalized advice.

Conclusion

Proper care after teeth whitening is essential for maintaining your bright, beautiful smile. By following gentle brushing techniques, avoiding staining foods and drinks, and practicing consistent oral hygiene, you can extend the life of your whitening treatment and keep your teeth looking their best. Remember that patience and careful maintenance are key to achieving and maintaining stunning, white teeth that boost your confidence and oral health.",1,1736869526.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False

 I (23M) met a girl (22F) last Autumn, we immediately had a nice chemistry and after four weeks we decided to go on a date. Or at least, that is what I thought we would, but she just ignored me (we went from seeing and talking everyday to a week without any contact because we had a break from university where we met). So in this week we should go on a date, but we didn’t and afterwards she was really nervous with me. She said she was really sorry and that she forgot it but still wanted to go, so I said something in the line of; ‘text me a couple of days next week when you are free and we can go’. Guess what? Never texted. And since that time the contact has been push and pull, one day I feel like she is really into me (e.g., we go get some coffee after uni), and the other day I have the feeling she is avoiding me (not speaking or texting for a couple of days even tough we sit in the same class). I don’t really mind a rejection (apart from the fact that it is never a ‘nice feeling’). However, I really want to understand what went ‘wrong’ so to say. All our friends basically thought we were going to end up together and I also saw a lot of obvious ‘good signals’.

 A couple of weeks ago she confessed that because of some childhood trauma (I’m not going to explain this private matter any further) she finds it really difficult to let people in (friends and romances). And all the time she is complaining about how ‘stupid’ her dates are. But then immediately after that she says ‘but all my friends are also not my type’. And I’m just so confused about these mixed signals. Because of the whole trauma I am really scared to just blatantly ask; “My feelings where this and this, did you feel the same’ etc.

Does anyone has any advice on how to deal with this? I notice that for me, I just want to know the ‘why’ since I (and our mutual friends) thought there was something more.

If anyone wants more information, I have more examples and situations but otherwise the post becomes so long lol.",3,1736869469.0,whatdoIdo,5,1.0,False

I don't really have any money to start with big machines and to be honest taking out a loan or something is super scary without some sort of real plan where even if I'm in the red it's part of the plan or I know what to do, I do have some more basic tools like my stove/oven, cooking utensils, molds, and I could buy more things like that.

Basically, I have two bedrooms in this house (1, 2 and 3 show one room while 4 and 5 show the other). I am trying to work out the best way to have a master bedroom and an office/spare room laid out between the two rooms.

The bedroom needs at least a double bed and at least one wardrobe for storage in it. But also any bright ideas for extra storage welcomed!

The office needs to fit a desk big enough for at least two 27 inch monitors and a sofa bed (one that pulls out to make a double bed). I would also like a large TV on the wall opposite the sofa if possible.

I can't work out which room to use for which function. Toying with the idea of master bedroom in the smaller room to maximize home office space but the larger of the two rooms also has this little alcove in it that makes layout a bit awkward.

In the picture you can see various layouts I have been trying to play around with. Also I'm sorry if its a bit confusing but I was using free online software so in pic 3, the random wardrobe in the middle of the room was meant to represent a coffee table, and then again in pic 5 I used it to represent a small desk. Hopefully that makes sense. In pic 4 the cabinet at the foot of the bed is meant to be my attempt at squeezing more storage into the arrangement...

I am just hoping you guys here might have some good suggestions for room layout across these two rooms.

I’m Chris, and my wife Julia and I are planning an exciting adventure—we’re heading to Greece for at least a month in May or June 2025! 🏝️

Our goal? To soak up the beauty of Greece, sip coffee by the sea, and maybe even learn how to say more than “kalimera”! Ideally, we’re looking for a cozy 1-2 bedroom apartment or house, preferably right on the beach. Imagine stepping out onto the sand with a cup of coffee in hand... that’s the dream!

Here’s the catch: we’re on a budget, so we’re hoping to find something charming that won’t leave our wallets crying for mercy. Good internet is a must because while we plan to relax, we also need to stay connected.

If you’ve stayed in or know of a spot that’s a hidden gem—whether it’s on a quiet island or a laid-back coastal town, we’d love to hear about it! Also, we’re open to tips about which areas are the best balance of serene and affordable.

So, where should we go to make our Greek island dreams come true? Any advice, recommendations, or even personal stories would be hugely appreciated!

Be part of a solution.","Better than we were isn't the same as where we need to be. And folks, that's where we sit with our winter weather response. We have designed a response based on our historical averages , highs in the mid forties and lows in the upper twenties, temperatures than would not trigger the warming centers because these are the normal situations people deal with. We have now blown past our planned worst case scenario.

This is a City/County/Community plan, and frankly, I've seen worse. You can't blame planners for weather that turns 12 degrees below historical averages for the whole damn season, and that's where we are. This isn't about the City or the County doing anything wrong. This is about the weather going to extremes. Instead of warming centers being a stopgap measure to prevent deaths from exposure, this extended cold spell is fundamentally changing the way they operate in the short term. We are having to adjust the plan to the circumstance, and adjust the plan for the future. No longer are we just dealing with homelessness, we are dealing with how we're going to address climate change as it deals with homelessness. This is two anomaly weather years, back to back.  
We base our warming center plan on a twenty-five degree base. We plan for 18 days of that. We blew out of that plan last week and we've got two months of winter left, and based on what we've seen so far, this will extend to March. It started early and doesn't look like it's going to let up.

So, what does that mean? Well, for starters, warming centers operate on donated funds and effort. They do not have an endless supply of food, and volunteers are tough to come by. Nobody wants to just help out anymore, they want to run the show and install their own agenda. The warming centers all have someone running the show that know more about what they're doing than anyone bitching. Read that last sentence again. What they need are supplies, tampons, underwear, toilet paper, food, casseroles, fruit, package non-perishible items, oatmeal, cup o soups, volunteers and money.

The food, supplies, and volunteers are immediate needs. We need that today. There is a two day cold bitter rain that will be above freezing and then we go right back to unseasonable bitter cold, and the doors to the warming centers will reopen. We need food and volunteers to make this happen, and we need them now. There are no gray areas or room for public debate. Let's be real clear about people using this situation for political advantage or to advance an agenda, you are the problem here. We need to get this done, and while everybody has their own ideas, our plan is what we've got and we have to make it work. If you don't like that, show up and get involved. It took two years of planning to get to where we are and that plan is working, it just isn't big enough. Here's where you can participate to change things.  [(link...)](https://www.knoxvilletn.gov/government/boards_commissions/knoxville-_knox_county_office_of_housing_stability)

The money will be vital to keeping this operation afloat. I don't know how the churches are going to manage utility bills. I saw the 18,000 number bandied about earlier today and I'm wondering if someone is estimating the bill or trying to fix the HVAC system permanently. There's well over 100,000 dollars worth of structural upgrades that need to be addressed if Magnolia Ave UMC is going to achieve it's mission. And it will happen, but it's not going to happen this week. This week, we, as a community, have to decide whether we're going to help therse churches keep their doors open until we can address these issues when there aren't an overwhelming number of people needing immediate aid. And we are going to have to decide that next week, and probably every week until this years jet stream decides to stay north of us. Nobody planned this, this isn't the governments fault, it's what climate change looks like. We need to adjust and adapt.

So why am I writing this? I don't want to see people die because they live in a community that will abandon them. If you're able, particularly if you're young with a bunch of energy, or old with whatever skills you've learned in life, we need your help with volunteering. Get your Sunday School Class. Reach out to Young Life and other groups on campus. Put a bug in your Professors ear about extra credit for volunteer work (that's how they used to get us to show up) , do something, and do something positive to help. Everybody's got a crappy plan that won't work, save yours for the meeting. Work with the warming on what they have going. It's not perfect, but it's working.

Finally, food and supplies. We need them. Tampons are a huge need and anyone that has ever bought them knows that price gouging is standard practice. If you see a sale, grab a box. We need coffee, and hot chocolate. Oatmeal. Things that can be heated. Casseroles. Bottled water. Toilet paper. If you are looking at something wondering if there is a need, there probably is. If we can all work together, bringing what each of us has to offer, we can get through this as a community. We don't want to be a community that allows its own to die cold and lonely just because we want to argue instead of help when the time to help is upon us. The time to help is now. KARM, Salvation Army, Magnolia Ave. UMC and Vestal UMC are all partners here. Please find it in your heart to do something. Large things happen when people band together doing little things.

We are having to adjust the plan to the circumstance, and adjust the plan for the future. No longer are we just dealing with homelessness, we are dealing with how we're going to address climate change as it deals with homelessness. This is two anomaly weather years, back to back.  
We base our warming center plan on a twenty-five degree base. We plan for 18 days of that. We blew out of that plan last week and we've got two months of winter left, and based on what we've seen so far, this will extend to March. It started early and doesn't look like it's going to let up.

So, what does that mean? Well, for starters, warming centers operate on donated funds and effort. They do not have an endless supply of food, and volunteers are tough to come by. Nobody wants to just help out anymore, they want to run the show and install their own agenda. The warming centers all have someone running the show that know more about what they're doing than anyone bitching. Read that last sentence again. What they need are supplies, tampons, underwear, toilet paper, food, casseroles, fruit, package non-perishible items, oatmeal, cup o soups, volunteers and money.

The food, supplies, and volunteers are immediate needs. We need that today. There is a two day cold bitter rain that will be above freezing and then we go right back to unseasonable bitter cold, and the doors to the warming centers will reopen. We need food and volunteers to make this happen, and we need them now. There are no gray areas or room for public debate. Let's be real clear about people using this situation for political advantage or to advance an agenda, you are the problem here. We need to get this done, and while everybody has their own ideas, our plan is what we've got and we have to make it work. If you don't like that, show up and get involved. It took two years of planning to get to where we are and that plan is working, it just isn't big enough. Here's where you can participate to change things.  [(link...)](https://www.knoxvilletn.gov/government/boards_commissions/knoxville-_knox_county_office_of_housing_stability)

The money will be vital to keeping this operation afloat. I don't know how the churches are going to manage utility bills. I saw the 18,000 number bandied about earlier today and I'm wondering if someone is estimating the bill or trying to fix the HVAC system permanently. There's well over 100,000 dollars worth of structural upgrades that need to be addressed if Magnolia Ave UMC is going to achieve it's mission. And it will happen, but it's not going to happen this week. This week, we, as a community, have to decide whether we're going to help therse churches keep their doors open until we can address these issues when there aren't an overwhelming number of people needing immediate aid. And we are going to have to decide that next week, and probably every week until this years jet stream decides to stay north of us. Nobody planned this, this isn't the governments fault, it's what climate change looks like. We need to adjust and adapt.

So why am I writing this? I don't want to see people die because they live in a community that will abandon them. If you're able, particularly if you're young with a bunch of energy, or old with whatever skills you've learned in life, we need your help with volunteering. Get your Sunday School Class. Reach out to Young Life and other groups on campus. Put a bug in your Professors ear about extra credit for volunteer work (that's how they used to get us to show up) , do something, and do something positive to help. Everybody's got a crappy plan that won't work, save yours for the meeting. Work with the warming on what they have going. It's not perfect, but it's working.

Finally, food and supplies. We need them. Tampons are a huge need and anyone that has ever bought them knows that price gouging is standard practice. If you see a sale, grab a box. We need coffee, and hot chocolate. Oatmeal. Things that can be heated. Casseroles. Bottled water. Toilet paper. If you are looking at something wondering if there is a need, there probably is. If we can all work together, bringing what each of us has to offer, we can get through this as a community. We don't want to be a community that allows its own to die cold and lonely just because we want to argue instead of help when the time to help is upon us. The time to help is now. KARM, Salvation Army, Magnolia Ave. UMC and Vestal UMC are all partners here. Please find it in your heart to do something. Large things happen when people band together doing little things.

A childhood friend I hadn’t spoken to in years recently reached out to tell me she’s now a Regional Vice President at Primerica, earning over $250,000 a year. She didn’t finish school and was a stay-at-home mom to five kids for the past 15 years. She admitted she had no prior experience in finance but started the business to support her family.

She grew up in poverty, but now she drives a luxury car, wears designer clothes, lives in a mansion, and travels the world… all supposedly thanks to Primerica. She also told me that next month, Primerica is flying her and her entire family to Orlando, Florida, to visit Universal Studios. According to her, everything… food, hotels, rides with no lines… is completely covered.

I’m struggling to understand how this lifestyle is possible. Is her income genuinely coming from Primerica, or is debt a big factor here? And does Primerica actually cover these extravagant trips, or are they tied to hitting sales goals with members footing some of the bill themselves? I’ve heard many MLMs promise “free trips” but require members to pay out-of-pocket or meet tough targets to qualify.

On top of that, I’ve heard her husband allegedly lends money to people who can’t afford mortgages at ridiculously high interest rates (he apparently pulls this money from their home equity)… I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s involved in other shady activities.

I just don’t know if people really make this kind of money with Primerica, or if there’s something else going on. She keeps pressuring me to meet for coffee so she can “show me the way” to financial independence, but honestly, the whole thing feels off and she’s rubbing me the wrong way. 

So, AITA for being skeptical about her “success” and not wanting to meet her?",0,1736868691.0,AITAH,19,0.5,False
1i18m8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i18m8j/ms_lost_and_found/,[MS] Lost and found,"The jungle was alive with sound: the high-pitched drone of insects, the guttural calls of unseen animals, the distant rush of water cascading over rocks. To Elias it was all just noise, a wall of sound pressing in from every direction. He kept moving, machete in hand, hacking his way through the dense undergrowth. The air was thick and humid, clinging to his skin like a second layer.

“Should’ve said no,” Elias muttered to himself. His voice sounded flat, swallowed by the jungle before it could carry more than a few feet. “Should’ve stayed in the city. Let someone else chase after dead men.”

The contract had been too good to pass up: a missing research team, deep in the jungle, last seen poking around a stretch of land no one had mapped yet. Their employer, some corporate bigwig with more money than sense, was desperate to find out what had happened. They’d offered Elias a small fortune to track the team down. Alive or dead, they’d said. He didn’t ask why. The money was enough.

Now, as he trudged through miles of unmarked jungle with no clear sign of his targets, he regretted it. Not because he cared about the team, they’d probably gotten themselves killed doing something stupid, but because the job was turning into a grind.

The first camp he found was picked clean. Tents collapsed, supplies scattered. He spotted a half-empty box of medical equipment, its contents spoiled by the damp. A map lay crumpled near the fire pit, so warped from the moisture that it was illegible. There were no signs of a struggle, no blood, no tracks leading away. Just silence.

He stood there for a moment, chewing on the end of a cigarette he’d forgotten to light. “Amateurs,” he muttered. He picked up the map, shook his head, and tossed it aside.

The days blurred together as Elias pushed deeper into the wilderness. The landmarks marked on his GPS became increasingly unreliable; rivers appeared where they shouldn’t, cliffs loomed out of nowhere. He tried to make sense of the terrain, but it felt like the jungle was shifting around him.

Nights were the worst.

He slept lightly, his hand always on the grip of his pistol, but the jungle never slept. The sounds of the day were replaced by something sharper, more insistent: rustling leaves, snapping branches, the faint splash of something moving through the water. He told himself it was just animals. Jaguars, monkeys, the usual jungle fauna, but it never stopped putting him on edge.

By the fifth day, the isolation began to wear on him. He talked to himself more often, swearing at the heat, cursing the team for dragging him into this mess. He tried to radio his employer once, but the signal was gone, nothing but static.

“Figures,” he muttered, jamming the radio back into his pack. “Middle of nowhere, no backup, no comms. Hell of a way to make a living.”

They found him on the seventh day.

It was just before dawn, the faint glow of morning barely visible through the canopy. Elias had set up a small camp near a river, boiling water for coffee over a sputtering fire. He was staring at the flames, trying to shake off the stiffness in his legs, when he caught movement out of the corner of his eye.

He turned sharply, hand on his pistol, but it was too late.

They came from the trees. Silent, painted figures emerging from the shadows like wraiths. Their bodies were slick with mud and ash, their faces obscured by grotesque masks made of bone and feathers. Elias barely had time to draw his weapon before they were on him, their hands grabbing his arms, his legs, his throat.

“Get off me!” he snarled, struggling against their grip, but they were relentless. He kicked out, catching one of them in the chest, but another took his place. Something hard struck the back of his head, and the world went dark.

When Elias woke, his hands were bound, his head pounding like a drum. He blinked against the harsh sunlight, his vision swimming, and realized he was being carried.

The village was like nothing he’d ever seen. Small huts made of wood and thatch were clustered around a central clearing, where a group of villagers stood waiting. They were silent, their faces painted in the same bone-white patterns as the ones who’d captured him.

Elias was dropped onto the ground with a grunt. He rolled onto his side, spitting out dirt, and looked up at the circle of villagers surrounding him. They didn’t move. They just stared, their dark eyes unblinking.

“The hell do you want?” he growled, his voice raw.

They didn’t answer. Instead, one of them, a tall figure wearing a mask adorned with feathers and teeth, stepped forward. The others parted to let him through, bowing their heads as he passed.

The tall figure knelt before Elias, tilting his head as if studying him. Then, without a word, he reached out and smeared something across Elias’s forehead. It was cold and sticky, and the smell of it made Elias gag. Blood, he realized. Fresh blood.

Before he could say anything, the villagers began to chant.

Elias’s head swam as the chanting rose around him, a low, guttural rhythm that seemed to reverberate in his chest. He couldn’t understand the words, but their cadence was hypnotic, pulling him into a state somewhere between rage and stupor.

The tall figure, still kneeling before him, reached out and pressed a hand against Elias’s forehead. His fingers were rough and calloused, the pressure steady and unyielding. Elias tried to jerk away, but the man’s strength was unnatural, his grip like iron.

The chanting grew louder.

Elias’s vision blurred, the edges of the villagers’ forms blending with the surrounding jungle. It was as if the world itself was dissolving, becoming less real. The tall figure whispered something soft, rhythmic, and incomprehensible. The words crawled into Elias’s mind, slithering into the cracks of his consciousness like worms.

He closed his eyes, trying to block it all out, but the whispers followed him into the darkness.

Elias didn’t remember being moved.
When he opened his eyes again, he was lying on cold, damp stone. The air was thick, heavy with the scent of mildew and something sharper, metallic, almost sweet. He pushed himself up on shaky arms, his wrists still bound, and looked around.

The cavern was immense, its walls glistening with moisture and streaked with veins of black and red. Bioluminescent fungi clung to the rocks, casting an eerie green glow that barely pierced the shadows. In the center of the chamber was a pit, its edges jagged and uneven, descending into absolute darkness.

The villagers were there, standing in a semicircle around the pit. They were silent now, their faces tilted upward as if waiting for something. The tall figure stood at the edge of the pit, his back to Elias, holding a crude, bloodstained knife.

Elias groaned, the sound echoing faintly in the cavern. His head throbbed, his body weak. He tried to rise, but his legs buckled beneath him, sending him sprawling back to the cold stone.

The tall figure turned at the noise, his mask catching the faint green light. Without a word, he gestured to two villagers, who approached Elias and hauled him to his feet.

“What is this?” Elias rasped, his voice hoarse. “What the hell are you people doing?”

They didn’t answer.

Elias was dragged to the edge of the pit, where the air grew colder, denser. The metallic scent was stronger here, mingling with a faint, sickly-sweet aroma that made his stomach churn.

The tall figure began to chant again, the same guttural rhythm as before. The villagers joined in, their voices blending into a single, droning harmony.

Elias looked down into the pit and froze.

At first, he thought it was empty. A void so deep that no light could reach its bottom. But then he saw it: movement. Slow, deliberate, and immense. Layers of something shifted in the darkness, their surfaces glistening like oil on water. A limb, if it could be called that, emerged briefly, its form too alien to describe, before melting back into the mass.

Elias’s breath caught in his throat. The thing below wasn’t just moving, it was alive.

The chanting grew louder.

The villagers began to sway, their movements synchronized as though guided by an unseen force. The tall figure raised his knife, its blade catching the faint light, and began to carve something into his own forearm.

Elias’s knees buckled, and he would have fallen had the villagers not held him upright. The thing in the pit shifted again, and for a moment, Elias thought he saw faces, hundreds of them, all emerging from its surface. They stared up at him, their mouths open in silent screams, before dissolving back into the writhing mass.

Something brushed against his mind.

It wasn’t a voice, not exactly. It was an odd sensation. A low, rumbling vibration that resonated deep within his skull. Images flashed behind his eyes: alien landscapes, vast and empty; stars winking out one by one; a yawning void that stretched endlessly into the dark.

He screamed, but no sound came out.

The knife came down, not on Elias, but on the villager to his right. The man crumpled to the ground, his blood pooling at the edge of the pit. The chanting stopped abruptly, replaced by a deafening silence.

Elias felt it then, the presence in the pit. It wasn’t looking at him, not in the way a person looks, but he could feel its attention. Its awareness pressed against him, vast and overwhelming, crushing his thoughts beneath its weight.

His vision blurred. The cavern twisted and warped around him, the walls seeming to breathe, the floor buckling beneath his feet.

Elias began to laugh. It started as a low chuckle, but it grew, building into a manic cackle that echoed through the chamber. The villagers stared at him, their expressions unreadable beneath their masks.

He fell to his knees, still laughing, tears streaming down his face.

The tall figure stepped forward, his head tilting as he observed Elias. Then, with a slow, deliberate motion, he pushed Elias toward the pit.

Elias didn’t resist.

As he fell, the last thing he saw was the thing below, its shifting layers spreading open to greet him.

The jungle was quiet when the rescue team arrived, unnaturally so. There were no bird calls, no insect drone, only the crunch of boots on damp earth and the faint rustle of leaves in the humid air.

Captain Merrick led the group, his machete carving a path through the dense undergrowth. Behind him, his team moved cautiously, their rifles held at the ready. They were mercenaries, hired by the same corporation that had sent Elias Vorn into the jungle weeks ago. Their job was simple: find Elias, find the missing research team, and report back.

But something about the mission felt off. The silence, the oppressive heat, the way the jungle seemed to close in around them—it was like stepping into another world.

“This place gives me the creeps,” muttered Daniels, the youngest member of the team. He swiped at a bead of sweat trickling down his temple.

“Focus,” Merrick snapped. “We’re not here to sightsee.”

The trail wasn’t hard to follow. They found the first signs of Elias two days in: scraps of his gear scattered along the forest floor. A broken compass. A torn satchel. Then came the blood.

The first patch was small, just a smear on a rock, but as they went deeper, the signs became more disturbing. Strips of skin hung from branches like grotesque decorations, their edges ragged as if torn off in a frenzy. Pieces of clothing, soaked in blood, were draped over roots and rocks.

Daniels gagged as they passed a severed finger lying in the mud, its nail cracked and blackened. “What the fuck happened here?” he whispered.

Merrick didn’t answer. He kept moving, his jaw tight, his eyes scanning the shadows.

They found the first body on the third day.

It was one of the research team, or what was left of him. His corpse was splayed across the ground, his limbs bent at unnatural angles. His face was frozen in a mask of terror, his eyes wide and unseeing. Carved into his chest were strange, angular symbols that seemed to shimmer in the faint light filtering through the canopy.

Daniels stumbled back, bile rising in his throat. “Jesus Christ...”

“Keep it together,” Merrick barked, though his own voice wavered.

The trail grew worse from there. More bodies, more pieces. Fingers, an ear, an entire scalp nailed to a tree. Each piece was a breadcrumb leading them closer to something they couldn’t understand.

By the fifth day, the team was falling apart. Daniels refused to eat, his hands trembling so badly he could barely hold his rifle. One of the others, Carter, started mumbling to himself, his eyes darting nervously at every shadow.

It wasn’t just the bodies. The jungle itself felt wrong. The air grew heavier, thicker, making it hard to breathe. The trees seemed to lean closer, their branches twisting into shapes that looked almost human.

It was then that they found him.

He was sitting in a clearing, his back to a massive tree, his head tilted upward as if staring at something only he could see. His body was mangled with strips of skin missing, his hands raw and bloody, his fingernails torn off. One of his eyes was gone, the socket dark and sunken.

The remaining eye rolled toward them as they approached.

He stared in silence.

Merrick stepped closer, his rifle trained on the man. “Elias Vorn?”

The response was continued silence and an unbroken stare.

“Where’s the team?” Merrick demanded.

Nothing.

“Where are they Elias!?!” Merrick pressed, his voice rising.

He didn’t answer. Instead, he began to hum—a low, tuneless drone that set Merrick’s teeth on edge.

“Sir,” Daniels whispered, his voice trembling. “We need to leave.”

Merrick hesitated. He wanted answers, but something in Elias’s eye told him the man was beyond saving.

“We’re taking you out of here,” he said finally, lowering his rifle.

The humming continued.

“Contact base. Tell them we found the bounty hunter but no team.” Merrick ordered.

Elias began to scream—a raw, guttural sound that echoed through the clearing.

His shrieking silenced the surrounding ambience of the jungle.

The team dragged Elias out of the clearing, his screams echoing behind them. They didn’t look back, didn’t stop until they were miles away.

But the jungle followed them. The air grew heavier, the shadows darker. Whispers began to creep into their minds, voices that weren’t their own. By the time they reached the extraction point, half the team was dead—lost to the jungle or to themselves.

Elias was silent when they boarded the helicopter, his body limp, his eye fixed on something far beyond the horizon.

Merrick sat beside him, staring out the window as the jungle disappeared beneath them. But even as they rose higher, he couldn’t shake the feeling that they hadn’t escaped.

In the corner of his vision, he saw Elias’s lips move, forming the same words over and over.",1,1736868678.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

First day is always a bit up and down but day two is easier and the hunger pangs have died out throughout the course of the second day. When I say hunger pangs it is really only when others are eating that I feel weird not eating but it gets easier.

I did have one or two coffees with low fat milk in the mornings then water the rest of the day. Days 3 & 4 I added 2 litres of LMNT which I have since realised container artificial sweeteners so I will be looking for an alternative way to get electrolytes.  

I broke my fast with a bowl of bone broth and 2 scrambled eggs on the Thursday evening.

I then did OMAD over the weekend but also had a couple of beers and bottle of wine Saturday / Sunday.

I'm doing the same again this week, may even stretch to the Friday evening so I can leave the weekends free to eat, although this time black coffee only and no alcohol and try to stay low carb.

The numbers, between the 6th and 13th were a loss of 4lbs. I did peak at 10lbs but the empty bowels and water weight was probably the 6lb that I gained when I ate again. I also did not make the best choices when eating at the weekend and finished up a Xmas chocolates which I will not do this weekend! 

The biggest takeaway for me was how easy it is to do and see results. All other times I have yo-yoed and this time I am determined to drop the weight and keep it off. It might because I turn 50 this year but I am fed up being overweight. 

I am planning to drop to 185lbs so at 4lbs per week this is going to take a while. Hopefully that will allow me to change my eating habits so that once the weight is gone I can eat at a diet that maintains me at that size. I also intend to keep fasting for the health benefits of giving my body a rest from digestion. I will aim to do shorter fasts which should make regulating my body weights easier.  

42hrs into my second extended fast.

I thought posting here may help others know what to expect and would appreciate any advice or guidance from those who are further along the road of fasting than me.",10,1736868299.0,fasting,2,1.0,False

Being ghosted makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me. I want to be self aware you know? But it’s driving me insane. How do you come to terms with being ghosted? 

Myself (M/26) and this coworker (F/35) met at work a couple years ago and hit it off really well. I make friends pretty quickly with a lot of the people at work and started to organize this group of us that would meet up at one of the bars downtown every Friday and I ended up inviting her out with us. She started coming out for drinks with us almost every weekend. Every thing was cool! We were friendly but not flirty, at the time she was married and I was in a 5 year long relationship. I wasn't about to be a homewrecker or a cheater, and when this all STARTED I had no intention of being anything more than friends. I even invited her husband out when we all did our little weekend group bar hop outings and everyone got along really well for a while. 

This goes on for a couple of months until one day she comes into work crying, telling me that her and her husband are getting divorced after about 10 years. I didn’t know what to say so I tried to be the support friend for her, telling her I was here if she needed to vent or escape the house for a while, anything. So we started getting coffee before work, going on walks after work, and then slowly our group outings with the rest of our friends became just one on one outings. 

While this was happening my relationship was becoming stagnate, and my girlfriend at the time and I broke up. Shortly after that my coworker and I  became each others rebounds/situationship. We would go out, drink, and by the end of the night end up in each others cars. She hadn’t moved out of the house her and her husband shared yet, which I understand takes time. But that’s when it started to get weird. 

Months went by and they were still “together” and then trying to fix things. So we took a step back, then would relapse until eventually we just stopped talking. I quit the job, found a new one and stayed out of each others orbit for the better part of a year. 

After this year-ish long term of silence she texted me out of the blue saying that she’s officially divorced now, and ghosted me because it was too much to juggle all at once and apologized for it. Life is short, so I tried to be as understanding as possible and forgave her for it, and extended an invite for coffee so that we could catch up. (Stupid I know, I should have left it at forgiveness but not extended further) 

So then we reconnect, and things go back to this weird situationship where I’m told “I just want to be friends” but then if we go out to a bar I’m pulled in and kissed and told that she loves me, only to be ghosted for days afterward. 

This past time has been longer though. We went out in November, got coffee went for a walk and stayed sober, nothing got weird and it was really nice. When we get back to our cars she said something along the lines of “I’m gonna go home, I miss my dog.” Which just felt really weird and out of place. So she goes in for a hug, tells me to drive safe, and that’s a she’ll text me when she gets home. 

She never texted. Couple days go by and I reach out, nothing.

It’s been two months now, and the ghosting is started to get to me. It hurts to be abandoned and have no idea why. I don’t HAVE to be loved, I can live with that, but what I absolutely cannot live with is the idea that I unknowingly said something that pushed her away, and I will never know what it was/if that’s what it was.

He says that things will never work out the way we want to, and that we will never find true fulfillment by living the lives we want or doing things we enjoy. He says that we will only find peace in Jesus, which I do agree with, but I like having a life. I like eating delicious food, feeling the wind brush against me, going swimming, drinking coffee, learning new topics, going to university, spending time with my friends and family, and I can do all of this while also maintaining my faith and relationship with God.

They were super heavy, I depressed to the point where I didn’t want to be here, I was crying every single day, instigated terrible fights with my partner, the symptoms were not manageable for me.

Realistically I’ve had almost 2 years of really rough periods but these last few months took the cake.

I was noticeably getting less sunlight & fresh air with weather changes and less activity due to job changes from restaurants to full time student. My life was stressful and I was isolating a bit.

30 days ago I started a new protocol. My supplement protocol has been: spearmint leaf, evening primrose oil, black seed oil, vitamin D, mega food blood builder iron supplement (amazing), magnesium, women’s probiotic, inositol, hydrangea root, l-theanine.

I’ve taken these every single day for a month with the exception of 2 days. 

I also have avoided gluten, caffeine, heavy dairy (but then started drinking milk 2 weeks ago because it was so cold and I was so drained).

Around the new year I was off my nutrition a little and was drinking coffee again. It was the time where I actually felt the PMDD the most. I picked a fight and was crying for like two whole days (right around when I was entering luteal). I realized through therapy that I need to be responsible for how I react and show up in the world. I don’t want to be a stressed/overly critical partner.

I cleaned up my diet, did some self care, and started reading the book IN THE FLO by Alissa vitti (great recommendation to sync with your cycle).

Since those 2 days of crying and taking my power back, I have felt so much better. I’m bleeding now and yes my body has hurt and my energy has been low but it’s a world of a difference from before.

We stared at the blank screen for what felt like forever, letting the quiet permeate again. The room felt stuffy, awkward, and grey—an uncomfortable concoction of stillness and dread. I stayed silent, my gaze captured by the phantom lights dancing in my vision—the afterimages burned into my eyes from the video abruptly ending.

*""We have to find her,""* Cindy uttered, her eyes glazing as it never left focus on the black mirror before us.

Cindy and I began delving into who she was, searching for any trace of her online*—*social media sites, webpages, blog articles*—*anything Cindy and I could access. We only had her name and face, but it was enough.

Finding her social media profile within less than 10 minutes was slightly unsettling. Finding information about this woman within a few clicks and taps on the keyboard was a jarring thought. Anyone could be traced and searched for easily in this day and age, and I felt anxious to think deeper about it—what if it would happen to me, and not for good reasons?

As Cindy scrolled through Tina's page, she uttered to herself, being glad the woman was still alive*—*living a happy and peaceful life. She owned a market stall at the farmers market, at a beach in North Carolina. Photos of her with a young girl and an older woman were prevalent, in multiple photos throughout the years, as the three were the ones that mostly appeared on her gallery page.

I felt a sense of melancholy as Cindy persistently scrolled through Tina's profile. *""Do we have to bother this woman? I mean looking at her now, she's moved on. She seems to be happy and living a peaceful life, away from... all of this.""* I bit my lip feeling the hesitance in my voice, though my hesitation wasn't enough to deter me from speaking out what I thought.

It felt wrong to suddenly come into this woman's life, barge into her space asking questions that had brought her and her family pain decades ago. Especially if they truly had moved on from the past—from the tragedy.

*""It's not a matter of 'if' anymore, Josh. We have to do this, we have to get answers, to proceed and be one step closer to the truth.""* She said coldly, with no weariness or hesitation for what she was about to part-take in—ripping off a bandage from the families of the victims, opening up old wounds for the sake of uncovering the truth, but what's to expect from someone that's been obsessed with this case for over a year.

She truly was a journalist—a relentless one at that.

I made no arguments, I relented and let her take the wheel, even if it felt heavy on the inside—even if I didn't want to follow her lead, because deep down I knew she was right, we didn't have any other leads to follow, no other hints or evidence to track down within our grasp—this was our only hope.

My thoughts were ended by the ringing on my phone.

*""Mom.""* It read on the screen, my phone pulled out from the inside of my pocket.

I made a slight gesture as Cindy briefly glanced at me with a nod, pivoting my feet to the other room as I took the call.

*""Mom?""* I uttered, accepting the call.

*""Joshua, sweetheart. How are things there, are you getting ready for the family Christmas?""* She asked a hopeful tone in her voice, sensible even at the other end of the line.

I couldn't bear a response just yet as I froze, I had completely forgotten about the family gathering they had planned, it was going to take place in a few days, and I only had a day or two to pack up and prepare if I wanted to make it on-time.

*""Y-Yeah, I've been... Christmas shopping. Gotta get you and the others something for Christmas right?""* I stammered in my words, maybe I wasn't the best liar, I rarely would get away with lying, especially with my mother, it's like she just knew, whether from the tone of my voice or how my body reacted while speaking to her—she just did.

*""That's perfect! Although you didn't have to, we're just hoping you make it, as we're all going to be here during Christmas, you know?""*

Her voice sounded cheerful, genuinely—or so I think it is.

She made small talk and continued talking about the plans for the faithful day, it sounded great on paper. Everyone gathered from their respective lives, from different parts of the country, or world, visiting our childhood home just for this one faithful event.

What should be filled with love, peace, and prosperity, a time for joy and family, but as my mother continued to gush about the plans and how great it was all going to be, my eyes trailed to the dark window, staring at myself—my reflection, and the dark outline of 506's kitchen window.

It was around this month when they had passed, they too probably had plans for their own Christmas celebration, being able to spend time with each other, basking in the love and joy. Maybe even seeing all their other relatives under one roof, all the children gathered, playing around while the adults caught up in long familial conversations.

But, they didn't get to have that, they weren't given a chance to. As my eyes trailed into the darkness, my grip on my phone tightened. In a trance-like state, I felt my attention be pulled back once again, with the sound of my mother calling out to me at the other line.

*""Yeah, I'm still here Mom... It's been a long day, I just... dozed off a little bit.""* I mumbled, wanting to at least make it sound more convincing. She chuckled lightly, apologizing for keeping me up this late at night, and we exchanged goodnights' before ultimately hanging up.

I yawned realizing that for once I was genuinely tired, wanting nothing but to go to bed.

*""We leave tomorrow at 9 for North Carolina,""* Cindy spoke walking to me from the living room to the kitchen.

I simply let out an exhausted breath from my nose, with a shrug I walked past her grabbing my bag to put it back into my room.

*""I hope this works, I hope that making someone re-live a past trauma is worth all of this.""*

*""I don't... want to do this. But we have to.""* Cindy breathed out, a slight tinge of guilt present in her tone before staying quiet, gathering her things to leave. *""Josh, when was the last time you had your gas checked?""* She asked out of the blue.

*""Not recently, why?""*

*""Nothing, it's just... I thought I smelled something near your kitchen.""* She furrowed her brows, her bag in her hand as she stood by the doorway, pausing to think to herself.

*""Ah, I don't know. It's probably just the vents, I had Mr. Grant come in and fix my A/C earlier. I can't tell what smells anywhere at this point since my nose probably got used to it all.""* I reasoned, chuckling slightly as she held a solemn smile while nodding.

We said our goodnights and parted ways, her leaving my apartment, and I locking the door safely, before retreating to my room.

I understood the complexity of our situation, she held more bravery than I, in terms of making the tough calls, but the feeling of guilt, it's not just something I could brush past with the thought of doing things for the 'greater good', who are we to decide that for anyone.

Though the decision swayed from my morals, I relented—am I a coward for doing so?

I packed up lightly, it was just a short day trip, and I estimated we'd be back around nighttime, leaving at nine in the morning. I carried the stuff I prepared with me inside my backpack like a Boy Scout; my granola bar, two bottles of water, a mini first-aid kit, and a bag of trail mix.

Of course, my keys and wallet were somewhere along there, probably in the front or back pocket. With preparation being said and done, I left my apartment.

My eyes met the door of Mr. Jobert's from across the hall, the number '501' blaring at me, feeling the familiar guilt creep back in once more at the back of my neck. I tried to brush it off, looking away abruptly with a sigh stifled between my lungs and my throat, as I got into the elevator to wait down at the lobby for Cindy.

It was morning, usually I'd expect Mr. Grant down at the lobby making phone calls or scheduling repairs he had to do, but he wasn't anywhere to be seen. Chalking it up to the man probably somewhere in the building arranging repairs for other tenants, I walked around the lobby patiently waiting.

Cindy arrived not too long after, we got in my car which wasn't parked too far from the apartment, and after prompting up a GPS location map with the farmers market down in North Carolina, we finally began our journey.

The drive was quiet at first, I could tell we both had one thing in our minds at that moment. *""What do we say,""* I uttered, thinking out loud as the words slipped from my mouth and my gaze was focused solely on the road.

*""The truth, what we're there for.""* Cindy was blatant, her eyes never leaving the passenger seat window as she watched the trees pass by, the morning sunlight peeking through the branches and leaves before gently beaming on her skin.

*""Okay... and if she doesn't—""*

*""She will. She has to.""* Cindy cut me off, not even letting a sliver of doubt emit from my lips.

There was a brief awkward silence, I knew it would be a 4-hour drive from where we were to the beachside farmers' market in North Carolina. I tried to make small talk, asking about how Mr. Jobert was doing, what he was like as a Father, and how Cindy felt in general, growing up with him as her Father.

*""Honestly, he's not that different from then, and now. He was protective of me and Mom, but it grew worse when she passed. In the first few months, I couldn't go anywhere without him giving me a curfew, or him checking on me by calling every 30 minutes.""* Cindy said with a sigh. I chuckled finding Mr. Jobert's overprotectiveness to be endearing, although I could see why she would feel suffocated by that.

*""I love him, I do. Although lately, he hasn't been himself. More reserved, quiet, and... not there. I don't know, have you noticed it?""* She turned the question to me, meanwhile, I gave her a brief side glance with my hands on the steering wheel, and I shrugged.

*""Love the guy too, but... I'm not keeping up with his daily life closely like that to know, it'd be a little weird if I did, don't you think?""* I quipped as she chuckled, a genuine smile I don't think I've ever seen from her just yet.

*""What, not into older men?""* She teased as I felt myself choke on my spit.

*""Oh calm down, I'm just messing with you. I know you see him as a father figure of some sort. Speaking of... what's your family like? I've never seen them around.""* Cindy's attention was fully on me as mine was on the road, I let out a soft breath before shrugging slightly out of nervousness, I don't think I've ever opened up about my family in a long time.

*""Well... I grew up on the West Coast, my folks are situated somewhere in rural California. They were always on the go, making a living for me and my adopted siblings. My mother is barren so they settled for adoption, and you never see them since they never come here. Apart from my mother about a year ago, dropping by to leave a cross above my bedroom door.""* I blurted out, recalling information about my past, though not enough to overshare, remembering I've had troubles with that more times than I'd like to admit.

*""That's odd, why don't they visit?""* Cindy uttered, I gave her a brief glance just to see her expression, I could sense the sympathy in her eyes, I felt the odd feeling of being pitied, and I didn't like that.

*""I wish I knew. I've had a relatively good relationship with them... At least I think so, they're the only family I know.""* I said, a solemn tone in my voice as I felt a slight melancholy permeating with family being the subject of our conversation.

*""What about your biological parents, did they ever say anything about them?""* She asked.

I shook my head, I wasn't sure whether or not they had, and I just don't remember. I knew that I was adopted as a baby in an orphanage, while my parents were on a waiting list, hoping to adopt a newborn or a toddler, that's how I, and many of my siblings came to be under one roof.

Cindy didn't press further, even though she knew her boundaries despite being the nosy one between us two. We sat in a comfortable silence for a while, watching the beautiful scenery before us, as we neared crossing state lines. My stomach growled as I looked down briefly before feeling a slight fluster emit at the back of my neck.

*""Sorry, I skipped breakfast. I have a granola bar in my bag, would you mind if—""*

*""Just stop at the diner at the next gas station we get to.""* She cut me off, refusing to hand me my granola bar inside my bag, just laying waste in the backseat of the car.

*""I'm not gonna eat there, I'm saving up, I don't wanna waste money eating pancakes or food I could just make at home.""* I reasoned, and before I could talk about having to pay for my car, and other bills and expenses, she cut me off.

*""Well you didn't, so I'm buying.""* She said.

I glanced at her, trying to see if she was serious about doing so. *""What? Don't tell me you're turning down free food over fragile masculinity.""* She quipped, half-jokingly as she chuckled at her own words.

*""Oh no, please do. Just don't start complaining when I order the most expensive thing on the menu.""* I had a sly grin as I began to direct the car to the furthest lane, preparing to pull over when we reached the diner. *""Enjoy the freezer-burn diner steak then.""* She rebutted as I slightly winced at the thought.

Frozen, and slightly moldy steak was not something I wanted to consume first thing in the morning, especially on a long drive to get to our destination.

When we got to the diner, we had a fun time together. Though, it's probably something I wouldn't say out loud. We sat together and had playful banter about what to get, while I spent a good amount of time considering whether or not to make things harder for her, since she made us stop at some diner in the middle of the road.

In the end, I settled with a breakfast plate, and she had a stack of pancakes with artificially flavored strawberry syrup. It felt nice being able to get to know more about Cindy, I'd come to find out she does go to the same university as I did, except our schedules just never interloped, or I was just too focused on myself to actually notice whether or not she was around.

She spoke about her deadlines and complained about how pursuing an old case set her back from her academics.

*""I know nobody is holding a gun to my head, and that I'm doing all of this with my own volition. But deep inside of me, I know I want to finish what my mother started.""* She said, picking on her food as I stayed quiet, eating quietly.

*""I know how badly this case affected her throughout the years leading up to her death, I know they made my Mother some sort of target because she was digging too deep in the case.""* She continued.

*""Although the worst they've done, as far as I know, was to have authorities take the evidence she held against the Drovers—but that's exactly why I have to finish this. I have to know what she held against them, what my father refuses to talk about. The man would lose his mind if he found out I'm pursuing this case.""*

Cindy chuckled solemnly, a melancholic tone behind her slight grin as her eyes focused on the window. I made no effort to break the silence, letting her sit in her thoughts as she processed her own words, I had nothing to say anyway. Once more I knew I just had to sit and be a listening ear for her, to be there for her.

We left after paying for our meal, and we got back to the car, letting a generic pop song play on the radio to break the silence. We exchanged short conversations afterward, making gas station stops to use the bathroom or to get some snacks to pick on while we were out on the road.

Time had passed, as the once cold morning turned into a chilly afternoon. We arrived at the farmers market a short while after making the cross to North Carolina.

Sniffling, from where we stood beside the parked car. The beach was almost completely enveloped with snow, the waves rolled lazily, tamed by the winter's unrelenting blanket of cold. The beach looked eerie, the unorthodox combination of sand usually associated with summer and heat was overwhelmed by the frothy white snow.

Cindy clutched her scarf, covering half of her face further, seemingly to avoid the cold winter air blowing on her face. We began our walk, navigating to get to the farmers market as we followed the footprints of various other shoes, permeating all over the parking area as it led further away from the beach, and towards the dock, where various other shops were lined facing the ocean.

We walked through the docks until we saw from a distance the familiar roofs of market stalls, similar to the ones we'd seen in the photos we found. Most of the vendors were bundled up, hands wrapped in gloves as they hawked their goods to the handful of shoppers willing to brave through the cold.

*""Winter Sale! We have all the fruits and vegetables you need for your Christmas dinner!""* A vendor spoke out as Cindy and I walked by, I gave them a smile and a nod while she persisted, walking while looking around for a familiar face.

A few more vendors spoke out about their promotions and sales, while we walked scanning various booths, as well as their products. *""It takes a lot to sell and work during this season, struggling in the cold, waiting out here for hours, just to make a sale,""* Cindy uttered, gazing at the sparse crowd. I nodded but didn't respond further, my eyes scanning the small booths lined with mason jars, packaged baked goods, and woolen scarves.

We wandered for a while, out of habit rather than any real intent to buy, I felt a little bad just brushing off the vendors so I gave them gestures and greetings, rather than icing them out in the cold weather.

*""You know, you don't have to do that to every person we come across right?""* Cindy quipped.

*""I know, I just... want to.""* I shrugged, as she let out a brief chuckle.

We continued down the stalls until she paused, her eyes glazing over as her focus was on the woman draped in a blue sweater, her white scarf covering half of her face. She was occupied arranging the fruit baskets out on display, while a younger girl beside her draped similarly fixed the vegetables in an organized manner.

*""Tina?""* Cindy spoke out to her, catching both of their attention as my eyes slightly widened.

She's going for it? Not even bothering to lay the groundwork gently, just diving headfirst into re-opening this woman's old wounds?

*""That's me.""* The woman in blue spoke, revealing more of her face to us as she had a concerned expression on her face. I can understand why she would feel unnerved, having two strangers show up at her place of work wasn't exactly a thing you'd expect daily.

I was about to intervene before Cindy could start asking her questions, but ultimately, the girl was quicker, abruptly speaking before me. *""I heard you have fresh sea grapes, my father has been craving those lately, it's good for his immune system.""* Cindy's voice spoke higher than usual, a calm demeanor emitting from her as she approached the stall closer with a gentle smile.

*""Oh- oh yes we do. These usually grow in the summer, so they're hard to come by and cheaper during that season.""* Tina's expression shifted to a reciprocating smile as the two conversed, while I stood slightly dumbfounded.

*""I saw on your page that there were sea grapes so I had to come by with my... brother, to come and check it out,""* Cindy gestured toward me, as I gave them an awkward nod and a wave, her expression staying cheerful before looking back.

*""See Mom, I told you we need to put ourselves out there more, it drives more customers.""* The younger girl spoke, as Tina and Cindy chuckled at the girl's remark.

I stood giving them smiles and nods, letting Cindy take the wheel as the pair eased into us while preparing the fruit in a brown paper bag. *""I was wondering if we could have a word with you, we're from out of town, and... we just have a few questions if you don't mind?""* She spoke with a slightly faltered look from her once cheerful demeanor, holding a hopeful expression on her face as Tina furrowed her brows in consideration.

*""It's about Josephine. We know what happened to her and her family was not an accident.""* Cindy's words had Tina with a widened stare, her face almost turning pale on her already light complexion. She froze for what felt like a minute before she turned to the younger girl beside her who was continuing to organize the fruits and vegetables on a basket.

*""Sarah, I'll leave the store to you. If Abuela calls, just say I had to go on an errand real quick.""*

Cindy and I left with Tina, I felt slightly unnerved as we followed the woman, unsure where she was taking us, gesturing for us to keep going. We ended up at a coffee shop nearby, away from the cold weather outside. I sat beside Cindy while Tina sat at the opposite chair, warming her hands on the cup of coffee between her palms, as Cindy and I let her gather her thoughts, having to process and dig up old memories long left decades ago.

*""My name is Cindy, I'm an Investigative Journalist major at Virginia State.""*

*""I'm Joshua. I... I live in the apartment next to where Josephine and her family had passed.""* I wasn't sure how I was going to introduce myself, but I know just from the look Tina had in her eyes as she looked at me—a look of silent concern, a chill ran down my spine.

*""So you're not siblings...? I figured. You two look nothing alike.""* Tina chuckled lightly, as Cindy smiled and I scratched the back of my neck, recalling Cindy's white lie earlier. Tina's eyes were still on me as she observed my features, slightly longer than she did Cindy's.

We sat in the quiet pause before a light breath emitted from the older woman. *""Josephine and her family were good people. We lost them too soon, especially those sweet kids. They had a whole life left to live, Joseph was barely even a few years old, I held that baby when he was just a newborn.""* Tina smiled sadly with her eyes focused on the coffee between her palms, focusing her gaze on the steam emitting from the cup.

*""I remember his little hands clinging onto my finger while Hector had to make sure the other kids were okay at home, and Josephine was asleep resting after giving birth,""* Tina said, melancholy evident in her tone as she reminisced a peaceful time, her eyes on me as her emotions were even more evident, getting a better look at her face.

*""It's such a shame we couldn't give him and his siblings a proper burial. The bodies of Andrew, Mila, Jenny, and Joseph were never found. I didn't question it at that time... thinking that the fire practically incinerated those children. That thought haunted me for years, I hope those angels are resting in peace, lord knows they deserve it the most.""* I felt a slight prickle in my eyes, hearing and sympathizing with Tina's grievances, she and her mother must've held so much guilt as if they had survived the fire from within the apartment themselves.

*""I've been waiting—praying for years... just for something like this to happen, I felt guilty for the longest time leaving the town, leaving it all behind. But I did try, I tried my hardest, I fought my strongest, but at the end of the day, what more could I have done.""* Tina clasped a hand on her mouth, glancing down as her eyes watered brimming with tears.

This was painful to watch, to see someone have to dig up old buried memories, feelings suppressed to move on from the past trauma inflicted by the unfairness brought upon her and her family by the world, by chance, or maybe even by fate.

My mouth parted, unable to sit idly by while the woman teetered between breaking down and holding herself together. *""Please take your time, we don't have to do this today or tomorrow. You can let Cindy and I know when you're ready and—""*

Her hands reached out for mine, holding onto them for composure as she shook her head. ""*No. No, I can handle it.""* Tina held a look of determination after wiping stray tears off her face.

*""Josephine's story needs to be told, the world needs to know what truly happened to my sister and her family,""* Tina said, as Cindy prepared to record her words with her phone, she asked briefly if it were okay, to which the older woman simply nodded.

*""Weeks before the incident, Josephine had been complaining to me and our mother about the gas leak. Hector tried to fix it himself after the building manager was unresponsive—they said a lot was going on, so they were taking a bit too long to handle the family's apartment repairs.""* Tina paused with a distant look.

*""Hector couldn't fix it himself; the parts he needed to replace weren't something you could just pick up at a hardware store. They were foreign and imported, so back then they were harder to come by. It wasn't just a matter of money, although they were living paycheck to paycheck—even outside hires were struggling to find replacements that matched.""* Her voice held an agitated tone, undoubtedly frustrated as she seemed to recall previous memories.

*""Josephine begged the manager to send someone, to speed up the process as patching it up with tape wasn't cutting it anymore—but they brushed her off, setting their problems aside.""* Tina paused once more as her eyes glazed over, looking at me and then at Cindy.

*""Until it was too late.""* Her breath shook, struggling to utter the finality of what had happened to the Gonzales.

*""When we found out their death was being ruled as an accident*—*that the building did not fault the incident, I couldn't stand it. I wanted to rip every single person in that company to pieces, to cause them the same pain they have caused me and my family.""* Tina no longer held back her tears.

*""I gathered family members, friends, and community members to protest and speak out the truth, we did everything we could to get the word out, to get people to listen and to spread the truth, yet that company was always one step ahead of us.""*

Cindy shifted uncomfortably in her seat, glancing briefly at me with furrowed brows before turning to Tina. *""Do you think Elmwood and law enforcement was covering up their faults?""* She asked trepidation in her expression.

""I'm sure of it. They did it so cleanly too."" Tina sardonically chuckled under her breath.

*""A woman that lived in the building told me about the silent repairs Elmwood was making on those faulty gas lines, under the guise of 'general maintenance'. It's good they went ahead to finally fix that damn issue... but at the expense of my family?""*

*""I can never forgive that.""*

1i181yc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1i181yc/cant_stand_my_friend_anymore/,cant stand my friend anymore,"So i (21F) have this one friend (22F) and i cannot stand her anymore. 

Here are all things that she does:

1. Can only talk about herself or the past. Whenever she has some issues going on and goes to me for advice, i always listen and give her advice. However, when i want to lean on her, she responds with ""yeah idk how to help you with that"" and turns the conversation back to her. She's stuck in the past as well and the only conversations we can have are about stuff that happened 10 years ago until last year.

2. She doesnt accept the word no. Whenever she wants to hang out and i say that i dont feel like it, she keeps begging. And she begs until i say yes.

3. She constantly asks for money back. When we go out for a coffee, or go out clubbing, she says ""this one's on me"" and months later she asks for the money back. Im talking about 1-3 dollars. Id understand if it were a lot of money, but why say a 1.80 coffee's on you, when youre just gonna ask for the money back? just say i'll pay it and can u please return it later instead of begging months later? I never request money back when i say somethings on me, neither do our other friends. Not to mention i was paying for a double subscription for a service for like two years bc she ""wasnt allowed to use her card (bs)"" and never said ""hey give me those 4 bucks"" every month. Not to mention i and our mutual friend drive her everywhere and still begs for money back. 

4. She talks all happy about her plans with our other friends in which im not included (shes the one that plans these things) in front of me. One time i even helped her bake something for our other friends and didnt even get a piece.

5. Whenever we come around to her place, everything is messy. My other friends and i have to sit on her bed full of dirty clothes, walk on the floor full of used cotton pads. Not to mention she walks around naked in front of us, when no one else does this and it makes us uncomfortable. I'll also be doing my makeup in her bathroom or something and she'll just come in and do number 2 infront of me. She has two bathrooms in the apartment.

6. She tends to be jealous and attention seeking. She admitted thats she was jealous when our friend and i got boyfriends. Later she got a boyfriend off tinder that she maybe went on a date with four times before becoming a couple. She feels the need to tell every detail of their intimate life, so far that after doing it she has to text me like ""omg i did this to him"". She also lies about pregnancy scares, she's said theyve had an accident like three times in the past 4 months. She first says she hasnt gotten her period, then suddenly she says shes got it, and then a week later says she actually didnt get it at all. Obv as friends we worry about that but to me it seems like shes doing that for attention.

7. She keeps begging to come to things shes not invited to. Me and our mutual friend got invited by a mutual friend of ours (who she does not know) to a birthday party and she asked both of us if she can come. We had to tell her multiple times that this is not organised by us and that we cant just invite someone. She then said ""oh okay i guess its better to ask than to just show up"" like ???. She kept asking to come along to me and my bfs dates, one time i was hanging out with her, and then i had planned to go on a date w my bf. She invited herself to our date, which i didnt have a problem with bc at first she said shes gonna stay until her bus comes (30 mins) and then she changed her mind and said ""ill just stay as long as u guys are here"". Luckly we had to go somewhere, cause otherwise we'd be stuck with her for hours. She also often invites herself to our friends dates, but her and her bf dont mind because they just ignore her.

She's really starting to annoy me and i dont know what to do. I wish i had the balls to tell her im not feeling her anymore but she has the maturity of a 10 year old and thinks we're ""besties for life"". And she's sooo pushy i wish shed just leave me alone when i dont want to hang out. ",0,1736867149.0,TrueOffMyChest,5,0.5,False

1i17zne,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i17zne/dialingin_a_spirographicplanetary_wdt_tool_any/,Dialing-in a spirographic/planetary WDT tool (any recommendations?),"I've always been impressed by spirographic/planetary WDT tools in theory--they're just cool stuff--and finally, recently, took the plunge with a lesser-expensive spirographic tool--approachable $-wise, enough to try it out.\*

The one thing that has surprised me has been my need to dial-in the spirographic WDT tool.  (I probably shouldn't have been surprised by this.)  Specifically, while I typically use a 16g medium dark-roast dose in my standard double-shot basket (54mm portafilter), using a dosing funnel to contain the grounds for ""manual"" WDT'ing and an initial ""pre-tamp"" to get the grounds below the portafilter's rim, I've found that the spirographic WDT tool fluffs the grounds so much that, even after knocking the portafilter, they mound over the portafilter and then overflow it with tamping.  To try to handle this, I've now moved down to a 14g dose and am grinding finer to compensate, and the grounds just about run even with the portafilter's rim after WDT'ing, such that I can tamp with no or only negligible (a few specks) overflow.  (I don't know if this is a proper solution, but it's all I could think of, and the resulting espresso has been fine, once I started grinding finer.)  An interesting side-benefit of this:  I'm now using \~10% less ground coffee and saving a little $.   :)

I probably need to do some A-B testing to compare the output of my use of the spirographic WDT tool with my earlier, manual WDT practice.  But with my first few uses of the spirographic tool, I was impressed by a bit more consistent fuller-bodied texture and flavor in my espresso.  I'm not saying that this couldn't be reached with a manual WDT tool--likely, my earlier WDT efforts were lacking/not thorough enough (a good lesson learned, regardless).  But still.  Of course, this all also could be placebo.  ;)

If anyone has any spirographic WDT tool tips, please feel free to share--appreciated.  I still am finding the spirographic WDT technique a bit more finicky than manual WDT'ing.  Right now, as I said, I'm using a slightly smaller coffee dose (14g as vs. 16g) and grind more finely than previously, to compensate--with a medium dark-roast in a 54mm portafilter; fill my portafilter via a dosing funnel on top and then rap the portafilter a couple of times on my tamp mat, to help settle the grounds and get them even to or just above the rim of the portafilter; put the spirographic WDT tool on and give it around eight spins, rap the portafilter to settle the grounds, and then do a final, slow spin (per the manufacturer's recommended instructions); and then remove the spirographic tool and tamp.

Thanks--

But with the combined shortage of not having my medication (I haven't had it now for three months) and the stress of the past year, my mock tests just... I keep making mistakes. 

My biggest problem in my mock tests is ""planning and awareness""; from my perspective, it's because I'm trying so hard to remember the things I've messed up in the past and trying not to repeat them that sometimes I'm unaware of things happening around me. For an example, making sure to remember to check my mirrors before turning left at a junction, but missing the car that quickly came up behind me after I checked (tailgating, but still my fault for not noticing), then not pulling away fast enough. It sucks. These aren't mistakes I make when I'm doing my regular lessons. Even my instructor remarks on this. It just feels like... I don't know, like I'm trapped in my own brain, trying to make myself concentrate, only making the problem worse.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having a home kitchen island can truly transform your cooking space. It enhances both functionality and style. Whether you love to cook or just enjoy a place to gather, a kitchen island offers various benefits that can make your home feel more welcoming and organized.

First off, kitchen islands provide extra counter space. This is especially helpful for those who like to prepare multiple dishes at once. When you have guests or family members helping you cook, a larger area allows for more people to join in on the fun. You can chop vegetables, mix batter, and prepare ingredients all at the same time without feeling cramped.

Another key benefit is increased storage. Many islands come with built-in cabinets and shelving. This means you have more room to store pots, pans, and tools. It’s easy to keep everything organized and within reach. Imagine not scrambling around for that specific frying pan or whisk anymore. With a kitchen island, everything you need can be conveniently stored right where you use it the most.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-kitchen-island  
  
Additionally, a kitchen island can also serve as a gathering spot. It’s a perfect place for friends and family to sit and chat while you cook. Kids can do homework or join in on meal prep too. By creating an inviting space, you encourage social interaction, which makes cooking feel less like a chore and more like a joyous activity.

The aesthetic appeal of a kitchen island is hard to overlook. You can choose from various styles, materials, and colors to match your kitchen décor. A well-designed island can act as a focal point, adding character and warmth to your space. Think of charming wood finishes or modern stone tops that can upgrade the overall look of your kitchen.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-kitchen-island  
  
Functionality also comes into play when thinking about appliance integration. Many modern kitchen islands can house appliances like cooktops, sinks, or microwaves. This means you can have a mini kitchen within your kitchen. The layout becomes much more efficient, allowing you to multitask and streamline your cooking process.

Moreover, a kitchen island promotes better workflow. In many kitchen designs, the classic work triangle of the stove, sink, and refrigerator can sometimes feel disjointed. An island helps bridge the gap, creating a more fluid movement between cooking areas. This makes cooking smoother, particularly when you need to move from one station to another quickly.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-kitchen-island  
  
Here are some additional benefits of having a kitchen island:

- **Versatility:** You can use your island for various purposes—dining, food prep, or even as a home office.
- **Added Seating:** Many islands can accommodate bar stools, providing extra informal dining space.
- **Improved Lighting:** Installing pendant lights above the island can enhance the ambiance and visibility for cooking and eating.
- **Increased Home Value:** A nicely designed kitchen island can boost your home's resale value, as many buyers view them as a desirable feature.

One of the best things about kitchen islands is their adaptability. No matter the size of your kitchen, you can find an island that fits. For smaller spaces, consider a rolling island that can move out of the way if needed. Larger kitchens can take advantage of expansive, multi-functional islands with plenty of storage and seating options.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-kitchen-island  
  
Consider the layout you desire. You have options: L-shaped, U-shaped, or even a traditional rectangular island. The right choice depends on your kitchen’s design and your personal cooking habits. Take the time to envision how you will use the island and what will work best for you.

A home kitchen island adds so much more than just counter space. It enhances your cooking experience, promotes socializing, and even increases the beauty and value of your home. If you’ve been contemplating whether an island would suit your kitchen, the answer is most likely a resounding yes!

Investing in a kitchen island can truly enhance your space, making it not only more functional but also more enjoyable for you and your loved ones.

Design Ideas for Your Kitchen Island: Style Meets Practicality
--------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a stunning home kitchen island can transform your cooking space into a focal point where style meets practicality. An island is not just a place for meal prep; it's a gathering spot for family and friends. Whether you’re renovating or designing from scratch, here are some engaging ideas to help you achieve a functional and attractive kitchen island.

### Choosing the Right Shape

The shape of your kitchen island is fundamental to its functionality. Popular options include:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-kitchen-island  
  
- **Rectangular:** This shape is great for larger spaces and can offer ample surface area for cooking or dining.
- **Square:** Perfect for compact kitchens, a square island efficiently uses space while providing a cozy setting.
- **Round:** A round island can promote conversation and is ideal for smaller areas, creating an inviting atmosphere.
- **Peninsula:** Extending off existing countertops, a peninsula island can enhance workspace without the need for additional floor space.

### Materials Matter

Choosing the right materials for your kitchen island is essential for both aesthetics and durability. Consider the following materials:

- **Granite or Quartz:** These stone surfaces offer a luxurious look and are easy to clean, making them perfect for busy kitchens.
- **Wood:** A wooden island brings warmth and character to your kitchen. Opt for reclaimed wood for a rustic touch.
- **Stainless Steel:** For a modern look, stainless steel islands provide a sleek and professional kitchen aesthetic.
- **Concrete:** This versatile material can be molded into different shapes and finishes, offering a unique industrial vibe.

### Storage Solutions

Effective storage is one of the top advantages of having a kitchen island. Consider these storage solutions:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-kitchen-island  
  
- **Drawers:** Deep drawers are perfect for stowing away pots, pans, and utensils, keeping your island tidy.
- **Cabinets:** Closed cabinets can hide bulkier items and are an excellent way to keep counters clutter-free.
- **Shelves:** Open shelving adds charm and provides a perfect spot for displaying cookbooks or decorative items.
- **Island Cart:** A rolling cart can enhance mobility and flexibility, allowing you to use the island where you need it.

### Adding Functional Features

To make your kitchen island even more functional, think about incorporating additional features:

- **Seating:** Bar stools or benches can create a casual dining area. Aim for comfortable seating to encourage family gatherings.
- **Appliances:** Integrate features such as a microwave or a beverage fridge for convenience.
- **Sinks:** Adding a sink can make meal prep and cleanup much easier.
- **Cooktops:** If space allows, a cooktop can turn your island into a central cooking station.

### Stylish Finishes

The finish of your kitchen island can drastically change its appearance. Here are some stylish finish ideas:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-kitchen-island  
  
- **Two-tone Color Schemes:** Mixing and matching colors can create visual appeal. Consider a darker base with a lighter countertop.
- **Textured Finishes:** Incorporate Shaker-style doors or a distressed finish for a farmhouse feel.
- **Accent Lighting:** Pendant lights above the island can provide both illumination and a touch of elegance.
- **Backsplash:** Consider extending the backsplash design from your wall to the island for a cohesive look.

When designing your kitchen island, always think about how it fits into your lifestyle. Balancing style with functionality ensures that your space isn’t just beautiful but also practical. Remember, a kitchen island can adapt to suit your needs, whether that’s entertaining guests, cooking meals, or simply enjoying your morning coffee.

By focusing on these design ideas for your home kitchen island, you can create a space that truly reflects your personal style while also serving your everyday needs. Don’t hesitate to combine ideas and tailor the design to make the most out of your kitchen’s heart!

### Conclusion

A home kitchen island brings a myriad of benefits that can transform your cooking space into a hub of activity. By enhancing both space and functionality, an island allows for increased storage, additional seating, and a central area for meal preparation. Whether you’re hosting a gathering or enjoying a quiet family meal, the kitchen island becomes the heart of your home, facilitating movement and interaction.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-kitchen-island  
  
When considering design ideas for your kitchen island, balance is key. Think about how style can harmonize with practicality. From choosing the right materials that complement your kitchen decor to selecting an innovative shape that maximizes usage, the possibilities are endless. Adding features such as a built-in sink, cooktop, or even shelving can further elevate your island, creating a space that's not only beautiful but also highly functional.

When crafting your ideal home kitchen island, it’s essential to consider your lifestyle and needs. Gather inspiration from various sources, and don’t hesitate to mix and match styles. Your kitchen island can be a statement piece while still catering to day-to-day tasks. Embrace creativity, and let your personality shine through.

1i17xg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/PHSapphics/comments/1i17xg3/the_thing_about_healing/,The thing about healing..,"Hello, Sapphics. It’s me again.

I don’t know who needs to hear this, but healing doesn’t mean erasing. It doesn’t mean forgetting the love you gave or the memories that linger in the quiet corners of your mind. Healing isn’t a straight line; it’s a jagged, beautiful mess of forward steps, backward slides, and moments of standing still, unsure of what comes next.

There’s something bittersweet about realizing that you can hold space for both heartbreak and hope. It’s okay to grieve what was lost and, at the same time, make room for what might one day fill the emptiness. The pain won’t always feel so heavy—it softens, little by little, until one day, you notice that the ache has turned into something gentle. Something that reminds you not just of the hurt but also of how deeply you are capable of loving.

Love changes us. It leaves fingerprints on who we are. And even when it ends, that love still matters. It shaped you, stretched you, taught you things about yourself you didn’t know before. And maybe that’s the quiet gift of heartbreak: the way it cracks us open so light can pour in.

So, if your heart feels tender and raw today, let yourself feel it. Cry if you need to. Laugh when you can. Find the beauty in small things—a good cup of coffee, the way the sun hits the pages of a book, the sound of a dog’s tail wagging against the floor. These moments remind you that life is still moving, and so are you.

One day, love will find its way back to you. Maybe it’ll look different. Maybe it’ll feel softer, steadier. But it’ll find you. Until then, take care of the love you carry within yourself. That love deserves to grow, too.",5,1736866825.0,PHSapphics,0,1.0,False

Hello! 
I am working on a task where I need to do some calculations, and my tasks require me to find a few numbers about BMW and Mercedes. It’s about their connectivity packages, I need to find the price but since I don’t own any (a Mercedes or BMW) and I don’t speak German I can’t really navigate the German forums either, so I can’t find it. If you own any of these cars I just need you to check the price of the packages for me, I would really appreciate it. Even could buy you a coffee:), if you wish to.

If you feel like reading, and being traumatized via either the writing itself or the content it contains be my guest!","1 - Entwine

A locked box, floating in an endless void. Cold and alone. Meteorites pass by the box, speaking soft nothings to it. Promising things that cannot be done. Then, like all the others they disappear into nothingness, leaving the box alone once more. A shadow floating deep in a sea of darkness, never to be truly seen. Inside the box? Well, that's a mystery. A mystery no-one will ever take the time to solve. With a lock no-one cares to open, although everyone has a key. Not a single soul. Not even itself.

But whispers fly about like secretive birds, only landing on the ears of those they deem important, or necessary. The box hears them all. All the things it isn't meant to hear. Love affairs and broken hearts, the silent cries of the mourning and depressed. The chatter of the ignorant, the blissful. Wasting away their lives as if nothing mattered. As if it didn't all end. As if they would ever be remembered for the risks they took, the friends they cast aside.

The box drifts for all eternity. Hidden away from the world, its contents swirl in myth and legend off the lips of elders and through the minds of young children. Dreaming of a better life, yet never acting in such a way that any progress is made toward one. They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results, and if that's true the entire world is insane. Greed and Envy control it all. A rotting core to a condemned planet. The box shares these in common with it.

It knows this. It reaches ever closer, seeking to spew whatever vile refuse it contains onto this god-forsaken pride-infested prison. I watch it slowly creep closer. Our demise is so close, yet so far away. My name is Lisa Harrison. I am sixteen years old. I have a childish mother and delusional grandparents. I have one arrogant friend. My grades are sub-par. Life is as it should be. 

Another Meteorite passed the box today. I do wonder how long it will stay around. How long before its thin facade shatters, cast into the emptiness of space forevermore. As I watch out the window of the vehicle intended to drive me to my mother's house, I take in every bland, monotonous detail of the world around me. The over cut grass lawns and worn down crack houses lining this poor excuse of a country road may seem disturbing to some. Unsightly. I see them as an escape from my harsh existence, a get away.

I suppose in this way I'm similar to the box. A drifter. A hollow shell. There was a time when I broke free from this arduous loop. When I was free. The memory is faded now, a distant dream in a world of cruel realities. Although I suppose there is nothing to be done about it. Two more years. Just two more years until I, like the box, can disappear into the darkness where no-one and nothing will find me. I really can't wait. It's one of the few things I have to look forward to.

I've always been fascinated by the idea of criminal psychology. The way a mind on the verge of murder or theft views the world. Every thought. Every breath. Every movement has a unique reasoning behind it. It causes a chill of excitement to creep down the spine of my wretched body. My moral compass swings this way and that, belittling and ignoring the differences between right and wrong. There is no good and evil for me. Only desire.

I've spent countless hours attempting to understand why humans would force themselves to obey laws differentiating from that of our wilder kin. Why they viewed themselves as superior. We are not. We are predators, hunters, and pack animals. From the moment we are born our first instinct is to take and take until we are satisfied. We must be taught to disobey these instincts, and for what? To become slaves to our own kind? To work away our lives to please some other being because they believe we must? Don't make me laugh.

Mother sent me to school believing I'd connect with the other students. I do not. They see me as an outcast, and I see them as animals. We are not alike. I often consider ending their lives and taking all they own for myself. Dragging them away to somewhere they won't be found. They wouldn't be missed. Neither would I. Upon the date of my liberation from this moral imprisonment I saw the world for what it was. I saw myself. I saw the box. No-one came looking for me as expected, and I went about my day. 

The one and only reason I ever came back is because of a promise I made to an acquaintance. A promise that he never fulfilled. In that way I suppose he was my own Meteorite. A brief bump in a long and winding metaphorical road. As are the rest of these creatures. My mother for instance. An incessant, ignorant, abhorrent, and needy manipulative trainwreck. A parasite. A parasite whose removal I have contemplated time and time again. Who I would eliminate the second I knew it would go without consequence.

I wear many masks. The submissive housewife. The loving mother. The imperfect but caring daughter. The bleeding heart. The hesitant patient,  and the overly friendly casanova are all masks I wear to avoid prosecution that may be untoward my eventual permanent liberation. At the end of the day I am nothing and no-one but another animal. An animal who desires to prey upon whomever it sees fit, and tear apart those it does not.

That said, while I absolutely loathe these animals I digress. The forms and variants of entertainment they concoct for themselves are immensely intriguing. I do not deny that, at times, the inner child within me enjoys turning on whatever video console I am currently in possession of and engaging in a round or two of Pixel Strike 3D. Or constructing structures and challenging my survival skills in Minecraft. However, I am and have been capable of living without them.

Another thing I suppose is worth bringing to light is my complete hatred for speechcraft of any sort. Vocal communication and charisma are among the many things I could very well live without. Hearing a human being chatter about events which transpired six minutes ago as if they were ancient history and hyper analyzing each detail is the last item listed on my agenda. Or rather, it isn't listed on my agenda whatsoever.

If you wish to speak with me, or atleast the true me either wait until we are in an isolated area where I can devote my attention somewhat entirely to what you're saying and avoid slurred speech or grammatical errors lest you face my wrath. Henceforth if you do wish to speak in-depth to me write me a letter or text me, for which the same basic laws apply.

So forth, if the subject of such speech is Politics, Religion, or Conspiracy leave me out of it for I have no interest in your half-cocked, baseless theories. My mind is, as Sherlock Holmes would put it, stocked with grander and more essential furnishings then your shabby shit-shack. And no, I will not apologize for my explicit language. To hell with your moral obligations and your so called ""christian righteousness"".

Sue me for it. I will henceforth disappear into the shadows and bide my time until either my life or yours has passed and my charges have therefore been lifted. Furthermore, to call me delusional would be outright hypocritical to at least 95% of the human population taking into account religion, political views and otherwise intrusive stray thoughts. ""Judge lest ye be Judged"", no? As for discrimination of race, age, gender, sex, appearance and whatever else I could care no less. Race is a societal theory based upon early social darwinism. 

Age is a measurement of the time on animal has existed upon this earth and considering a roughly newborn animal of any other species will mate with it's own kin I do not see any reason to condemn pedophilia or incest other then human pride. Gender is a misconception of the roles a sex follows as a whole and once again falls under the category of societal theory and an all around humbug. Sex is no more than a specified code in the deoxyribonucleic acid determining the sex organs possessed by one organism. Sexual inequality is yet another object in my incinerator waiting to be abolished from my existence.

In other words, shut the fuck up and leave well enough alone. Agreed? I think so. As a ""victim"" of Attention-Deficit/Hyper-Activity Disorder I tend to realize these things. Things people either ignore or don't know. Things that are wrong with the world made law by ignorance. In a sense, my disorder has made me somewhat of a god. I believe this is the conclusion of the overhead document, and the beginning of the following tale. A log of sorts. Finally, you must be thinking

Shut your whiny mouth, and listen in.

It happened today. The one thing I had not expected. The box has landed on Earth. The chains unraveled, the door ajar. I must find it. I have to. It calls to me. I must break free, unite with this distant dream now come reality. It beckons from the crater, the dark pit it's carved itself. A landmark, an eternal reminder that it's claimed our world as it's own. It whispers in my ear, tells me things humans were never meant to know. It tells me it's name... I told it mine.

Its voice is deep and rich, smooth as finest silk and as bitter as the darkest of coffees. I crave it. The more it speaks to me the more I desire it. It knows not its purpose, I know not mine. We belong together. A primal urge consumes me. Turmoil and conflict are among things I enjoy. They give my life meaning, a certain flavor one might say.

As such, I tend to make attachments with the most maniacal, toxic beings this world can muster as if by some sort of curse. Meteorites I know well are going to damage me. Ram into me until they break my outer shell and intertwine their sick sadistic roots in my core. Forbidden fruit, one might say. Devrie Blood is one example of this.

Every moment with that woman is pure torture, beatings and cursing and manipulation of all sorts, however I can't find myself able to function properly without her abuse. Call it Stockholm's Syndrome but I quite enjoy our tumultuous relationship, whether it serves to aid me or otherwise. Could you call it love? Possibly. I wouldn't. I'd call it, as my friend Emmett used to say, a Kismesis.

A black Romance. I absolutely hate her so much that in a way... I suppose she's now a crucial part of my existence. Like Joker and Batman, but a but more lethal. She's a predator like me, an outcast. We're practically made for each other, don't you think? You may see me as a masochist, and while you may be correct I stand by my reasoning.

Is this what it means to be madly in love? Perhaps. Perhaps I'm bored with all of the sickening sweetness others offer and want a taste of copper. Blood, if you will. Much like Ouroboros, the snake devours its own tail... I too am an implementation of loathing hellbent on my imminent self destruction.

At times I wonder if she is the locked box. An unbreakable connection forged by fate itself forever out of reach, pleading for my eventual surrender to its dark truth. Her appearance remains a mystery to me, but her voice... Like an angel. Or at least as far as Christian Mythology seems to believe an angel is, atleast. It calms you, hurts you, kicks you, consoles you... Seduces you. Each word is like an unsung melody waiting to be heard. Her moans a beautiful song of passion and pleasure that embeds itself in the mind like a bullet to the brain.

Shadows surround her, swirling in a dark vortex of malicious predatory behavior. Oh how I dream of parting them and lying in the center, entangled in her embrace. Only then will I know solace in the chaos. Funny isn't it? How do I embody the purest essence of the very thing I despise? I suppose even I, as a predator, am only human.

Back to the subject of the box... The box that may or may not be a metaphor for a certain Devrie Blood, that is. As I approach the crater in which it's rendered itself a sort of tomb, the whispers grow louder and the sky darkens, the stars clouds vanish and stars die, replaced by an unforgiving abyss.My fingers caress against the callous pinewood surface, but beneath that I know is something more. Every pulse and throb of mana beneath it's surface, every angular ridge full with sweetest cyanide.

A silent threat. Every nerve ending firing off, screaming, begging me to get away yet urging me closer. Danger. I knew it well. Death, a cruel mistress. And as dark, twisting roots emerged slowly from its entry, I did not scream. I was not afraid. I observed, taking in every eerily breathtaking detail. Kinship and familiarity were often foreign to me but this.... Creature taught me, and I knew it well. I lay back on the damp soil, allowing the tendrils to creep along my body, burrow beneath my skin. Pain and Pleasure.

Sorrow and Joy. Order and Chaos. Like a tidal wave they crashed over me, engulfing my very being as the roots entangled my heart and soul. The voice no longer whispers, now powerful as ever, filling my ears and shaking my body to its core. I was home, and as the name of the creature once again blessed my thoughts with it's presence I rejoiced. Rejoiced and let the name roll softly off my tongue as it's roots invaded my most sacred of areas. 

Winding through every crevice, every organ, every fold. Filling my stomach, my lungs, my womb, and I knew. I knew this was my purpose. ""Barbatos..."" And hearing my cry of ecstasy slithered down my womanhood, it knew all of my sensitive areas. Every bunch of nerves to poke and prod as it spilled it's toxic seed into my body that we together will raise as our own. That together we will teach the ways of the predator and once and for all rid the earth of humanities sickening plague. I now know the feeling these humans chase after. The thing they crave the most. I have achieved it.

I know my purpose, I have found my home. The place where I belong. A fantastical bundle of emotion is worming its way into my cold corrupt body, and I know it is to be called Love. Love for Suffering. Love for pain. Love for Barbatos. The sun is so much warmer. Candy is so much sweeter. The breeze is so much cooler. Every pricking sensation against the skin of our shared body overwhelms the senses. 

Flesh. Blood. Bone. Steel. None too hardy to consume, each too succulent to go without. Screams. Sighs. Moans. Cries. All too joyous to be heard. Barbatos tells me there are more of us. Waiting. Watching. Wanting.

We must cleanse this world for their arrival. For our child's arrival. May he too know the pleasures we know. Gear the sounds we hear. Think the thoughts we do. Insanity is repeating the same thing over and over and expecting different results. What of those who repeat differentiating actions again and again expecting the same results? Is that ignorance? Curiosity? Sanity? It does not matter.

Each day is a new experience. Each hunt is a new thrill. We are Eternal. All Hail the Entwined. All bow before us. Beg for some sort of mercy. Those filthy animals deserve no mercy, their mercy will be to become one with our children. Serve as vessels for the very thing that took their lives. Another Box approaches.

My first one was in 2022. You can look at it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/x1gai6/i_am_32_years_old_make_120000_on_a_combined/). My husband (35) and I (34) are still childfree with a dog. I'm going to leave out some of the deeper background info so I'm not repeating the first MD, but you don't have to read that one to read this! If you want more of our history, you can check the previous entry. 

# Assets and Debts: 

Retirement Balance: About $210,000 between the two of us combined, although about half of that is in my 403b. Shout-out to my employer who matches my 5% with 8%, vested immediately. If I'm still at my job in a year and a half, that 8% goes up to 12%!

Home Equity: We purchased our house in 2020 for $361,250 (put down 10%) and have $297,127 remaining on our 2.5% interest-rate mortgage. Our house was appraised for over $500k about a year ago, and we were able to get our PMI removed! Current estimate on the house is $540,000, which means we would have $181,950 in equity, but that home value feels pretty inflated for a 100+ year old, 1300 square foot home with one bathroom. Demand is high in my area and supply is low, but who knows if that will stay the same. 

Car Debt: $7,000 - but this leads into a little life update. In April 2023, my husband was laid off from his job. He collected unemployment, then temped and freelanced for a while, finally getting a new job in April 2024. From April 2023 until today, we had several home emergencies and repairs that totaled about $7,000, a pet emergency that is now a chronic condition that has totaled over $5,000 so far (shout out to pet insurance that saved us thousands), and an emergency surgery on my end that was another like $600 plus a loss of income for my husband because his temp job was hourly and he was helping me out for a few days. We also had three deaths in our families since February, which resulted in some overspending due to sadness and the way that these emergencies made us short on time (opting for DoorDash instead of a home cooked meal while spending time at the hospital). Plus another $500 or so for travel to a funeral. In the midst of this, we had two old cars, and needed to replace one of them when my husband got his new job because his (17-year-old) car was on its last leg and he was doing a lot more driving. While we technically had the cash to pay for a car in full ourselves, my parents offered to let us borrow $7k so that we could buy a $22k car in cash and still have ample savings for whatever other emergencies came our way. Right after we replaced his old car, my (20-year-old) car started having a whole bunch of wear and tear issues, which ended up totaling about $3,500. My parents, once again, took pity on us and were letting us wait until the new year to make payments. We're very privileged to be able to borrow from them vs. taking out a loan or draining our savings. It's been a pretty rough 18-or-so months in a lot of ways and it's left me feeling drained financially and emotionally. 

Cash Savings: $30,292, broken down as follows:

* $24,688 - income replacement emergency fund - needs to be up to $32,000 eventually. 
* $1,000 - emergency fund for my dog to cover our Trupanion co-pay
* $3,954 - house emergency/sinking fund - fill it up and then use it as needed
* $650 - my paltry savings for a new car so far. I have a long way to go!

Checking Account Balance: About $7,000 at the moment, but it fluctuates 

Other Debts: It's at 0% APR and I could pay it off today easily, but we have $857.03 outstanding on our Home Depot card that we are paying off $100/month. No other debts!

# Income

I am still at the same job I've been at for 10 years. Trying not to dox myself, but I work in the non-profit education space as a 12 month employee. I make $70k working as a manager overseeing aspects of our fundraising program. I could make more money elsewhere but I like it overall and appreciate the stability and perks (free lunch, 4 weeks vacation, 7 sick days, 2 personal and 2 floating holidays annually - plus all 29 school holiday days off and Fridays off in the summer. I honestly feel like a part-time employee sometimes and it's amazing). 

My husband started his new job in April and he works in public policy doing writing/communications. While I was writing this MD, he got a $2,500 raise! I'm not going to include that in our budget just because we haven't gotten a paycheck yet to see what it comes out to bi-weekly. But, his salary now is $62,500 + $2,500 health stipend for a total of $65k. 

I have a few little side hustles that bring in like $100-$300 every month. They're more like hobbies that make me a modest amount of money. I net like $2k-$3kish annually.  

My husband has a blog and makes a small amount of money on that but it all just gets reinvested into his projects, so I don't really count that as income. 

After taxes, health/dental/vision insurance ($708/month - ouch), FSA ($150/month), and 403b contributions (5% for me)  + side hustles, we have averaged $8k/month in take home pay since my husband started his new job in April. It will probably go up by like $150 once the raise kicks in. 

The 2023 median household income in my area is $148k. We are south of that, but close enough that we are still middle class for our area, I think. 

# Expenses

*I'm going to base this off of averages from 2024/expected amounts for 2025.* 

Monthly: $5,955

* Mortgage/Home Insurance/Taxes - $2,144 
* Groceries - $770 - This is crazy for two people. I acknowledge it. In my defense, it does include toilet paper, cleaning supplies, etc. Basically anything I get in a grocery store on a week-to-week basis goes here. 
* Utilities - $400 - This is an average for sewer, gas, electric, water, and our alarm system because I don't know where else to put that
* Internet - $50
* Phone - $116
* Household/Garden - $120 - this is for random things that come up each month like garden stuff in the summer, rock salt in the winter, and things for the house like new towels, storage bins, whatever. 
* Home Depot 0% Card - $100
* Entertainment/Fun - $900 - this is broken down as $250 for me, $250 for K, $400 for both of us combined. Our clothes come out of our individual budgets in this bucket. I think eventually we need to have our own separate clothing budgets, but I have not been able to figure out how to manage that so it's all lumped together for ease. 
* Streaming Services - $50
* Dog - $500 - Yes. This is very high. After our dog's hospital stay last year, he was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and two co-morbid conditions that can be quite serious. He's stable at the moment, but with that comes regular vet visits, three medications, and prescription food. We also pay for a dog walker on the days that we both commute. 
* Car Payment - $200 to parents
* Gas/Tolls/Parking - $300
* Insurance - $180 (ugh, just went up a lot)
* Non FSA-medical needs - $65
* Life Insurance - $60

Short-term sinking funds: $350

* Personal Care - $50 (mostly haircuts and occasional dry cleaning)
* Gifts - $180
* Yearly Memberships - $40
* Donations - $20
* Tax Prep - $25
* Seasonal Expenses - $35 (hosting holidays for family, etc.)

Short-term and long-term savings: $1,695

* Job-Loss E-Fund - $780
* Home Maintenance Sinking Fund - $300
* Vacation - $200 - We also cash in our credit card points when we go on vacation and use them for this
* K's Roth IRA - $200
* New Car/Car Maintenance Fund - $200
* Weddings - $15 - for the first time in years, I don't have any weddings on the schedule but I just throw $15 in there for the next time one comes up 

Our goals are to replenish our Job-Loss E-Fund back to $32,000, then increase Roth and new car contributions.

# Monday

5:30am - I wake up. This is my first day back to work after two weeks off for the holidays. I (stupidly) scheduled a pelvic floor physical therapy appointment for 7:30 the morning after two weeks off, so I'm up early and rushing around. I feed our dog and take him for a quick bathroom trip in our yard. 

K is remote today, and we're supposed to get snow, so I take his Subaru with AWD and head to my appointment. 

7:30am - I check in and pay my **$20** copay. 

8:15am - I leave my appointment - it went well but I was really sore today, so it was more painful than usual. (I don't want to bog down this MD with medical talk, but I have a very tight and also weak pelvic floor thanks to a lifetime of IBS and possibly some anatomical luck of the draw leading to muscle imbalances since I have a fun combo of scoliosis and partial bi-lateral sacralization of the L5 vertebrae. Happy to talk pelvic floor PT in the comments if anyone has questions). 

I arrive at work 5 minutes later, since the PT office is about a mile from my job. Since it's the first day back there's a lot of pleasantries and catching up. 

I eat my breakfast (1/2 egg yolk, cup of egg whites, avocado, and sriracha) and have a cup of coffee, but realize I left my 2% milk (and my low-cal salad dressing) at home, so I guess I am having half and half in my coffee and an unhealthier salad at lunch today. I am in a constant battle with genetically high cholesterol and trying to stay on the lowest dose of statins. I broke every rule for heart health over the break, and I want to get back on track. 

10:00am - The morning trucks on. It's very much a first day back after a long time off - catching up on emails, getting organized again. I eat a not-very good smoothie, which is my attempt to get more fiber and protein into my diet. It's a 1/4c of quick oats, a cup of 2% milk, a scoop of Naked Whey protein powder, and half a tablespoon of Nesquik (lol). I am out of bananas, unfortunately, and those are pretty crucial to the taste for me. Later on in the morning, I have a cup of baby carrots and unsweetened Motts blueberry applesauce. 

11:45am - A few of my colleagues and I go grab lunch in the dining hall at work. We get to eat for free! One of my favorite perks. I make myself a chicken salad from the salad bar. 

1:00pm: I have my weekly 1:1 with my supervisor. She approved an article I wrote for our website and a speech I drafted for someone else to give (thankfully - I hate public speaking but love ghost-writing remarks), so that felt good. After our meeting, I have another cup of coffee and an apple. 

3:50pm - They let us leave a little early because the weather is crappy. Luckily, the roads are fine and I actually hit less traffic than I usually do, so I'm home by around 4:20. 

5:00pm - We have leftover soup from the night before, so I put the pot on the stove to heat it up. It's one of my favorite winter soups. It contains the usual carrots/celery/onion/garlic plus green chilis and/or pickled jalapenos, cilantro, and then brown rice and ground turkey. The turkey gets sauteed with a bit of pickled jalapeno brine for a bolder flavor and then spices are cumin, chili powder, and cayenne. So good. After I eat, I salt the driveway because it's super icy. 

6:00pm - I head to the gym. I have a session with my personal trainer today. I am questioning why I decided to do both pelvic floor PT and a personal trainer session on the same day, but here I am. It's a leg-focused day, so squat is my main lift. 

While I'm at the gym, K walks the dog and then picks up our grocery order from the store (we do online shopping and then pick up). The total comes to **$179.82.** This is, unfortunately, typical for a week's worth of groceries and household supplies. This time we needed less food but expensive items like dishwasher pods, toilet paper, laundry detergent, and olive oil. My favorite soup is also on sale - 10 cans for $15 so I take advantage of that. Those things alone total $80. The rest of the money goes to supplies for tacos, stir fry, and soup; lunch items for K, and breakfast and snacks for both of us, plus the $5 shopping fee.

7:45pm - I get home from the gym, shower, and do the dishes. My dog is really restless so I play with him a bit. We got a new area rug a week ago, and it's not laying the way I want it to. I order non-slip pads for the corners from Amazon for **$10.65**.  

8:45pm - Finally, I can sit down. This was a really long day of appointments and a first day back in the office. I watch a little bit of TV and play a stupid game on my phone for Swagbucks. It's an app where you can earn money for playing games and doing things like surveys. It sounds scammy but I've earned $250 on this one game alone, and I enjoy it as a mindless way to unwind. Worth it.

9:30pm - I read for about twenty minutes and then turn the lights out a bit before ten. 

**Total: $210.47**

# Tuesday

5:50am - I get up. K has been fighting a cold and has decided to take a sick day, so he's not commuting today. I feed the dog and take him out in the backyard and then get ready for work. I have to wash my hair today which always feels like a process, and my waves come out wonky. I swear, my waves have never dried the same way twice in my whole life. I salt the driveway and the steps again before I leave for work. 

8:00am - I get to work (I listened to Money for Couples on my way in) and eat my egg and avocado breakfast. I have a cup of coffee - I remembered my 2% milk and low-cal salad dressing this time, although the latter spilled in my lunchbox which is a mess. 

The morning flies by because I am busy working on research and preparing a briefing that's due. I drink my weird oat protein smoothie again. We got bananas in the order last night, but they aren't ripe yet so it's still lackluster. 

12:00pm - Lunchtime! I make myself another salad at the salad bar. Get myself some more coffee to go with it. I check YNAB while I'm eating. I earned $6.50 from one of my side hustles and it hit my account - I'll make sure not to spend that huuuuge sum all in one place. Oh well, not every week can be a winner. K spent **$2.24** for something on Apple, and that shows up on our joint credit card. 

2:00pm - I think I finish with my research/briefing and send it along, but then get few additional requests of things to add. I work on it for another hour and finish for the time being. I kind of hit a wall after that, and decide to do the mindless but easy task of uploading receipts to my expense report that's due on Friday. I also eat a pear I snagged from the cafeteria. 

4:00pm - I leave work and drive home. Once again, low traffic today and it takes just about a half hour. When I get home, K lets me know he purchased a gift for a friend for **$35**. 

5:00pm - Since K was home sick today, he prepared the chicken for our tacos, which was just boneless/skinless chicken thighs, seared in a bit of oil, and then slow-cooked with Goya's mojo marinade (that stuff is amazing). 

I was all ready to have guacamole with our tacos, but K informs me that the grocery store must have been out of guac because we didn't get it with our order. I'm so sad! I mash an avocado and add some lime juice and a bit of red onion to it. Not quite what I had in mind, but it'll have to do. 

We each have three tacos with corn tortillas, the chicken, guac, reduced fat cheese, and mango peach salsa. They're great if I do say so myself!

6:00pm - After dinner, I walk the dog while K does the dishes. Then, I head to the gym for a quick ab workout. After I get home, I shower and start a load of laundry and K empties our trash bins and recycling. 

8:00pm - We watch an episode of *Unsolved Mysteries* together, but I'm also playing my Swagbucks game on my phone and he's scrolling on his. It feels nice to unwind and sit down. 

9:30pm - I get into bed and read for a half hour. K comes to bed and we turn the lights off around 10 and try to get some rest. 

**Total: $37.24**

# Wednesday:

5:30am - K's alarm goes off. I fall back to sleep until 5:45 when mine goes off. He feeds the dog and takes him into the backyard while I jump in the shower. After I'm done getting ready, I take the dog around the block on a longer walk. I leave around 7:30 and stop to get gas on my way in, which costs **$38.22**. K commutes today and will have to pay for parking - **$7**. 

8:00am - I get to work and have my usual egg breakfast and grab a cup of coffee. We have our annual report coming out in a few weeks, and I'm doing a specialized mailing to four different groups of donors in-house where they get a cover letter with the printed piece. So I get started on the background work that needs to get done to execute that - ie, mail merges, printing letters, getting them signed, etc. If you've ever worked in fundraising, you have probably done all of these things!

Mid-morning, I eat my smoothie (my bananas were finally ripe and it tastes much better) and some carrots. 

12:00pm - It's lunchtime again. I make a chicken salad at the salad bar and this time also grab a cup of chocolate pudding for dessert. I make myself a cup of tea to go with it. My period just started, and I have some minor cramps so it's nice to just relax at my desk without working for a bit. 

Our dog walker texts that they had a quick walk and then she played with our pup inside. She bought him a puzzle toy! She's so kind and considerate. Always going above and beyond. 

1:00pm - I work a little bit more on my expense report and then pivot, as I'm waiting to hear back from a vendor with a receipt before I can submit it. I have a lot of little loose ends to clean up now that the data-entry folks in my department are getting caught up on gift entry following the end of 2024 (always a busy time for giving). 

In the middle of all this I get a call from an elderly donor who I know quite well. She was actually looking for someone else in our department, but we end up talking for a while nonetheless. 

After I'm off the phone, I eat an apple and snag a piece of chocolate from one of my colleagues

4:00pm - I leave for work and get home a little after 4:30. K gets home the same time as me. We assemble leftover tacos for dinner. 

5:45pm - After we eat, I head to the gym and K walks the dog. It's bench/deadlift day for me. I rush through the workout as fast as I can because I have my period and just want to go home. 

7:00pm - After the gym, I shower and do the dishes. K has a standing commitment for one of his hobbies from 7-9 on Wednesdays, so he's busy. 

Once the dishes are clean, I vacuum and mop the downstairs. Rock salt has somehow gotten everywhere - maybe from the dog's paws or the dog walker or  our own shoes even though we leave them by the door. It takes multiple passes to clean it up. How frustrating!

8:00pm - I sit down to rest. I'm finishing a not-very-good show on Netflix. I'm invested enough to want to see how it ends. I play my game on my phone. 

9:30pm - After I take the dog out one last time, K and I read in bed together for a half hour before turning the lights out for sleep. 

  
**Total: $45.22**  


# Thursday

5:30am - Same as yesterday, K's alarm goes off. I snooze for 15 minutes and then get up. When K is taking the dog out in the backyard to use the bathroom, he realizes that he left a light on in his car all night. He's super worried about his battery. 

I shower. K's car starts! Hooray!

I leave to walk the dog. A neighbor-friend, who is lovely and a bit eccentric, runs out of her house after M (my dog) and I. It's like 20 degrees and she has no coat on! She's holding a cigarette and a cup of coffee. 

""I had a really hard night last night. Can I have a hug?"" I say sure, of course, and we hug in the street for a moment. I ask her what's wrong and she says it's nothing too bad, work stuff. We walk for a second together until she's too cold. I tell her to text me if she wants, and she runs back to her house.  

When I get back from walking M, K has left for work and I realize he did not leave cash out for our dog walker. This is supposed to be one of his responsibilities, so normally I'd be annoyed (mental load and all). But I know he was really worried about his car, so I'm not upset. I leave her $44 for yesterday and today's walks. 

8:00am - I get to work. Have my egg breakfast, coffee. I have cramps and I feel like I'm starting to get a migraine, and I have a long day ahead of me. I treat myself to half and half in my coffee and half a rizatriptan - a migraine abortive. I hope a half works. You're only allowed to take 4 pills per month, so I try to be as conservative as I can. 

10:00am - I have my smoothie. I am in a bit of a holding pattern at work. If there's one thing that annoys me most about my job, it's this. A lot of times I rush to get drafts/the first parts of projects done. Then they go on to someone else for approvals or edits or next steps and are supposed to come back to me, but that person takes a while to get back to me. So then I don't have much to do but know that the next part of something is looming over me, and I can't work on it yet. 

I decide to check YNAB. Our monthly phone bill (**$116.60**) and M's pet insurance (**$49.99**) have hit our account. I also buy tights (**$22.99**) and under-the-bed storage containers (**$29.99**) on Amazon. K commutes today, so I know there's another **$7** charge coming for parking. 

This little break gets interrupted by a colleague who needs my help. She asks me to write a communication to our donors who live in LA and may be affected by the wildfires. This is such a terrible and devastating situation that I don't even know what to say. I type something. Delete it. Start again. 

12:00pm - I eat lunch (chicken salad) and have coffee. My rizatriptan worked but I can feel that the migraine could start again at any moment. I try to balance water, coffee, and medicine. 

I am on the planning committee for social events for faculty/staff. We have one tonight, and I'm supposed to help with decor and set up/clean up. I go up to our storage space to pull out some items to get ready for setting up later. 

When I get back to my desk, K has texted me. He got a $2,500 raise! We knew this might be a possibility because of what it said in his offer letter, but we assumed a raise would come after some type of performance review. Instead, his boss just came into his office and said it was happening. What a wonderful Thursday surprise! 

3:00pm - A few other volunteers and I set up for the event. The caterer comes and we decorate, help lay the food out, move tables around, etc. It's a fun time but we were asked to extend the hours of the event until 6:30 to acomodate a group of staff who couldn't come to then. But by 6 a lot of people who came early had left, and then only two people from the later group came. At least I got to eat a good meal - chicken, orzo salad, roasted cauliflower. 

I sneak to my office to take a full Rizatriptan. The busyness has made my migraine come back. 

Clean up happens quickly at 6:30, thankfully, and I leave for home with a ton of leftovers, including an entire tray of quinoa salad. 

7:15pm - I get home. I text some neighbors to see if they want quinoa salad because I have several pounds of it. Two households take me up on the offer. I drop one container off with plans for K to deliver to the other house tomorrow while he's remote since that neighbor was out. 

K is out with a friend, and I am exhausted from running around at the event and fighting the migraine. After delivering quinoa, I melt into the couch with the dog and stay there until bed. 

10:00pm - I take the dog out and go to bed, but K is still out. So I'm in and out of sleep for the next two hours half-waiting for him. He finally comes home around midnight, and eventually I drift into a deeper sleep. 

**Total: $226.57**

# Friday: 

6:00pm- K is remote today and I ""sleep in"" a little bit. I feed the dog and take him out back. K gets up with me because he didn't do the dishes when he got home last night and told me he'd do them first thing in the morning. I shower, make breakfast once the dishes are clean, and leave for work. 

8:00am - The usual schedule - egg breakfast, coffee. My colleague needs some preparing for a donor event tonight (that I thankfully do not have to work). A few of us help out and get it done quickly. 

9:30am - A colleague from the employee social committee comes by to help me put the decor from last night back in storage. After, I eat some carrots as a snack and check YNAB. There's a **$17.05** charge on our credit card related to K's hobby/blog. He also bought something on Amazon for **$23.74**. I am not sure what it is, but I mark it as his expense on YNAB. 

10:30am - The morning is moving by pretty slowly. I grab some leftover orzo salad from last night's festivities from the fridge as a mid-morning snack like an animal. I have some more end-of-calendar year work to do now that the data entry folks have entered the bulk of gifts that came in over the break, so I decide to devote most of the day to that. 

11:45am - I stop to eat lunch. I do a salad and then chicken fingers, since it's chicken finger day and I can't resist. I have a cup of coffee and snag a chocolate from my colleague's candy jar. 

1:00pm - I have a standing meeting with a colleague that happens every Friday. We go over a strategy plan for one of our donors. Then, it's back to the end of year work. I snack on a pear. 

3:00pm - It's the last hour of my day, on a Friday, and I have finished most of what I needed to do. I kind of goof around on my phone in between answering an email or two until it's time to go. 

4:45pm - I get home. We have friends coming over tonight, and K did a great job straightening up the house which I really appreciate. We had a big mental load/household responsibilities chat a few months ago, and I've noticed a definite change. We were going to have stir fry tonight, but I came home from the work event on Thursday with all those leftovers. We have orzo salad, steak, and cauliflower. There's still a huge vat of quinoa salad for lunches for the rest of the weekend, too. 

After dinner we meet up with the neighbor-friend who hugged me in the street to walk our dogs together. This is a fairly common occurrence. When we get back we vacuum and get ready to see our friends. 

8:00pm - Our friends, another couple, come over. We hang for a while, take edibles, and watch a movie. It's the chill kind of Friday I need. I have a glass and a half of wine, which turns out was a mistake because it starts to give me a headache. 

11:30pm - My friends leave, and thanks to the munchies I eat several pieces of chocolate. But then I go to bed - my head is pounding from that wine and my period. 

**Total: $40.79**



# Saturday: 

8:00am - I wake up, but then fall back to sleep until 9:40. I bolt out of bed, with intentions to make a 10am yoga class. But it's snowed the night before and there's just no way I'm getting dressed, cleaning the car, and getting to the gym in 20 minutes. I opt to just do a half hour on the treadmill, and make my way there.

10:45am -  I finish up my workout and stop to get gas in K's car (**$25.93**). I come home and take the dog for a walk. I hop in the shower and then cook myself my usual egg breakfast. K has made coffee, and I have a cup. 

11:45am - I eat some of the insane amount of quinoa salad I have leftover from Thursday for lunch. I add in some tzatziki sauce and it's pretty good. I work on some laundry. K runs out to do some errands. 

1:00pm - I have a call with my friend, who is going through a tough time in her relationship. K and I went through something similar about seven or eight years ago, so I listen and try to offer some advice. 

3:00pm - K comes home from running errands. He was gone for a while, and I find it's because he stopped into a record store to reward himself for his raise. He spent **$80** but did buy something for me, which was really sweet. He also picked up a bottle of wine (**$14.40**) to bring to a belated holiday gathering we're going to tonight. I am really hungry and have a small can of soup as a late afternoon snack. 

5:15pm - We leave for the holiday gathering, and drive a half hour to my hometown to my parents' house. I give my parents  **$200** for our first car payment on the $7k we owe them. The party is just my parents, K and me, a couple who are longtime family friends, and their adult son. It's an annual tradition for us to get together, and it's really nice. We just order pizza and have some drinks. K doesn't drink so he's my built-in DD. I have three glasses of wine. 

11:00pm - We get home, take the dog out, and pop on the record K bought for me. I have another glass of wine, which is ill-advised. I should be better about a strict three drink limit. After an hour or so, I head to bed a bit after midnight while K stays up later to listen to some more music. 

**Total: $320.33**

# Sunday

8:00am - I wake up naturally but K and I lay in bed with the dog for over an hour before getting up. K gives the dog breakfast while I shower. I take the pup for a longer walk afterwards, and then make my egg breakfast. I am nothing if not consistent with my breakfast. 

12:00pm - K and I finish the rest of the quinoa salad. I have a $50 gift card to Amazon and decide to put that toward a handful of things I've had my eye on. I order a new ceramic pan with a lid (**$40.51)**, a new rug for the bedroom (**$85.29**), and some clothes for myself (**$81.94**). This was way over $50. Oops.

I spend the rest of the day lounging on the couch in between loads of laundry. I snack on carrots and chocolate (not at the same time, lol). 

5:00pm - I make a stir fry for dinner. This was originally on our weekly menu for Thursday, but I had all that leftover food from work so I pushed it to today. In that time, my mushrooms went bad. I hate that. I hate wasting perfectly good food, but they are slimy. I settle for just broccoli and onion, with brown rice. For the protein I used these really good chicken teriyaki meatballs that we've been obsessed with. 

After dinner, our same neighbor-friend texts us to see if we want to walk our dogs together. We say sure and go around the neighborhood for a bit. After we get back, K does the dishes. 

7:00pm - We watch a movie together. I am playing that silly bingo game on my phone for Swagbucks still, and I hit a new goal! 10,000 swagbucks which equals $100. 

9:30pm - I read in bed for a half an hour, take a sleepytime gummy, and go to bed. 

**Total: $207.74 minus $50 with the gift card - $157.74**



# Reflections

This was a pretty average week, but we spent more on Amazon and less on weekend activities than we normally would. Usually we go out to eat or something, but our family friends paid for the pizza and our Friday hang was just at our house. I also got all that free food from work so that was different!

I'm struggling this month, I just started my period this morning and I feel.. bad. 

I live with my husband in Canada, but we're from the UK. My husband's dad is visiting us, and we live in a very small space—it's literally a shoebox. We've given him our bedroom, so we're sleeping on the sofa, which isn't ideal at the best of times, but right now, when I'm PMDD'ing, I feel like I can't cope without my own space. 

I tend to get very sleepy during PMDD, especially because my sleep at night sucks at this time and I feel like I have nowhere to go, no space for myself in our suite.

I work from home too, so this situation is even worse, I feel like I need to stay out of the house all day and work in coffee shops because I just can't deal with being in the small space with others when I feel like this. At least I can mentally switch off when I'm alone. 

Luckily my husband has taken the next few days off work and some days next week but I'm just feeling really down and overwhelmed about the whole situation and how I'm going to get through it. 

any advice? :(

SKIN CARE TIPS-

back to basics- yall dont need 10 skincare products , those are REALLY just marketing strategies. 70% skin health is your diet and nutrition , and 30 % is external care

\# diet - must include omega 3 fatty acid , vitamins , minerals , iron , calcium , collagen , antioxidants       , include fermented food in your diet, protein , biotin and HYDRATION!!!!!  (you can use supplements but nutrition derived from natural sources can never be replaces , they are best for skin and you will glow from within)  
AND BOOM - 90% of your skin problems will fade away , 70%..... if your skin is in really bad condition

\# skin care- if you are doing your diet properly all you need is - cleanser - toner - moisturizer (sunscreen in morning)  
if your skin is bad due to hormonal disorder , you SHOULD consult a doctor , hormones can mess up more than just skin and you might find out when situations worsen.  
if you are really busy ( a student or just usually busy) cancel out toner. moisturizer , sunscreen and cleanser is sufficient.  
If you live in really polluted areas (near industry or the pollution level is really high you need a deep cleanser OR double cleansing (oil cleansing first and and face wash later)

some natural skincare i do as an Indian (IT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE)

cleanser - gram flour (+ honey for dry skin) or deep cleansing using fuller's earth (NOT FOR DRY SKIN , ONCE AGAIN IM NOT A DERMATOLOGIST PLEASE DO PATCH TESTS OR MONITOR YOUR FACE AFTER USING)

toner- rice water cleanser (for all skin type)  
\- green tea (same)  
exfoliation - gram flour and turmeric face mask exfoliate without scratching or chemical use ( just moisturize THOROUGHLY after that)

moisturizer - light weight non comedogenic oil in winters (for dry skin)  
\- deep moisturizing winter cream ( for oily and normal skin)  
\- light weight moisturizer in summers  
vaseline's gonna grow your eyelashes ...... trust me , i tried and it worked  
mask - rub aloe vera gel on your face (natural , market bought if not available)  
\- honey and cosmetic turmeric (not kitchen turmeric , or if cosmetic turmeric not available use a small amount of kitchen turmeric , patch test first)

facial hair removal - use cyperus essential oil diluted with carrier oil (non comedogenic) in ratio of 1:50 ml post waxing/threading for gradual but permanent hair removal

people with oil skin - moisturize thoroughly , your skin might be compensating by producing oil for lack of moisture

YOU CAN REDUCE PORE VISIBILITY BUT NOT VANISH THEM WITH ANY AMOUNT OF SKINCARE !!!

Try slugging once a week and see how your skin react to it

fix acne-  
neem for fungal acne  
deep moisture for sabaceaous acne  
(i am not aware of any other acne tips , if you are please comment and i will update the post with your username)

\#workout plan

start slow - yoga , mild stretching , mild pilate , mild cardio etc - that's level 1 , you have to do each level atleast for 1 week  
level 2- increase a little bit , add  some planks , some high impact , increase pilate session , a bit harder stretches  
level 3 - start practicing split for flexibility (it's gonna take time) , do longer planks , longer cardio  
rec video for it - [https://youtu.be/63bhMpFZnvQ?si=oHoPtghvddPLIrc6](https://youtu.be/63bhMpFZnvQ?si=oHoPtghvddPLIrc6)  
level 4 - do more variety of cardio , harder stretches , longer Pilate sessions , longer planks and longer cardio  
level 5 - now move on to whatever changes you want in your body (might not change your body 180degree but it WILL make you confident) , weight loss , weight gain , muscle gain ,toning whatever  
for weight loss of weight gain get a blood test done first , it can be due to hormonal mess up  
weight loss- view dear peachie weight loss video , burn more calorie than consumed  
weight gain - vice versa of weight loss  
muscles gain- view channel hybrid calisthenics  
toning- yt - vicky justize and hana milly

\#study  
romanticize study  
watch Gilmore girls  
watch study with me videos (if possible) while studying  
candle trick - light a candle (smaller if you are just starting), grab your things (water , stationary , book and note book , coffee ) and study till the candle goes out , NO DISTRACTION WHILE THE CANDLE IS LIT !!!  
pomodoro method - split studies into short period of time with mini breaks in between -  
for eg- start with 25 min of focus and 5 min break , then gradually move on to 50 min of focus time and 10 min break  .science  has proven that people learn the best in short bursts of focus time  
dopamine resensitization method- stare at a boring wall 5 or 10 min before studying (trust me) and then start studying with pomodoro method , during breaks go back to staring at the wall , this is going to make your brain so entertainment deprived that studying start feeling not so bad

for better understanding and retention - study right after waking up , even if you wake up at 7 or 8 or 9 , sleep with a book nearby and start studying right after waking up , even before brushing !!! our brain is at superhuman intelligence level right after waking up , proved ,so try the hardest subjects at that time, i can link details if demanded.

alter ego method - practice having a trigger right before being super focused , maybe the trigger is going to a cafe/library to study , maybe it's getting ready before studying , maybe it is that scent of lavender , or maybe a small word or affirmation right before studying . once you master it , you are gonna get into focused mode whenever you pull the trigger

and lastly your grades dont matter , it's your hardwork that matters the most , grades might not help you in long run but hardwork will help you always

\# mental health-  
take time to meditate , even if it is 5 min  
journal your thoughts , do shadow work questions to understand yourself better  
purse your hobbies , even if you are only free on weekends  , if you dont have a hobby......explore and find one  🙂🔪  
watch tam kaur's mental health videos , they have helped me a lot

\#diet-  
not much but 90% of your diet should be super healthy and nutritious and 10% can be whatever you want..............that's how you create a balance.

\#sleep-  
for a good night sleep , eat dinner 2 hours before sleeping  
stretch to relieve tension before sleeping  
drink chamomile tea before sleeping  
meditate before sleeping  
no screen 2 hrs before sleeping  
if you have severe insomnia problem then take melatonin supplements after consulting a doctor  
here's how to increase melatonin production naturally- get exposed to sunlight for within an hour of waking up , if it's still dark , use get exposed to artificial light , and sleep in TOTAL DARK ROOM and low temperature  
sleep early, wake up early  
in india we drink tumeric milk 1 hr before sleeping for good night sleep

\#habits-  
no fidgeting  
no nail bitting or skin scratching or hair pulling  
no mindless scrolling  
start daily workout , even mild stretching on sundays  
wake up before 7 , 8 if it is sunday or breakday  
drink minimum 2 litres of water , 3-4 maximum , no more than that  
consistent and fixed sleep routine  
study everyday even if it is small study session  
shower everyday or atleast alternative days  
no gossips  
mind your own business  
detach yourself from negative situations  
take care of yourself EVERYDAY even if you feel horrible (ik , ive been there where even brushing your teeth is difficult but IT IS IMPORTANT , PUSH YOURSELF , DO IT EVEN IF YOU DONT WANT TO!!!)

\#makeup  
wonyoung is kind , just like wonyoung , be kind and opt for cruelty free makeup brands  
always do patch test before using a new product  
always remove makeup with double cleansing, and never sleep with makeup on  
do it for yourself not for others

\# mindset-  
just like wonyoung , stay unbothered , be kind and confident in yourself , have growth mindset and constantly keep improving

I'm at a crossroads in my career and feel like I could use a fresh set of eyes. I have a pretty fragmented career, partially because I changed countries a few times, partially because I job hopped a bit. 

I always wanted to work in sustainable finance, focused in agriculture. So what I did was to land agriculture jobs first (I worked as a commodities trader and then in rural lending at a bank). Then I moved to sustainability program management in coffee and cocoa. Then I figured I didn't have much knowledge of finance per se so I landed a job at an alternative investment company, that later on catapulted me to a fintech, that then catapulted me to an insurtech. 

Now I have no idea how to tell my story to interject with sustainable finance career and land a job in the field. I feel like recruiters have a hard time understanding my career path and I get why. So I'm thinking about getting a career coach to help me through this process, but the investment is kinda high. Has anyone hired a career coach? If yes, was it worth it? If not, what other options do I have (just keep applying, go back to school? Etc). 

Im a bit lost here so I'd appreciate any insights ",4,1736865888.0,sustainableFinance,1,1.0,False

And tips for others. ,"I hate to brag, as I usually like to remain humble about most things in my life, however I am so proud of myself with my results in just under 1 month on Zepbound. Total of almost 30 Pounds down since December 16th (first shot at 2.5 mg). Below are my stats and some more info on what I’m doing. 

Male 30 years old, 5 foot 10. SW 220 CW 193 GW 180 (170 if I can continue to loose) 

Diet: diet is very bland and frankly boring. Lots of rotisserie chicken, veggies such as broccoli, squash and zucchini, peppers and carrots. I do have a veggie ranch dip I use to add flavor to the veggies. Dessert is blueberries, blackberries raspberries and/or strawberries. All in small quantities. I still drink my coffee in the morning and usually have half a can of diet soda. I also drink water throughout the day. 

Exercise: This I believe has been a huge factor. I’m at the gym at least 3 times a week…..nothing but intense cardio. 65-75 minutes on either the stair stepper or inclined treadmill at a steady fast walk. Haven’t tried to elliptical or bike but they would work as well. (I just know my ass would be in so much pain from doing a bike for that long 🤣)

What I’m NOT doing: Alcohol intake has not stopped completely but has heavily decreased. Maybe a glass or 2 on the weekend but that’s it. Zero during the week. Just no desire anymore. Zero sweets-my fruit intake helps with that desire for something sweet. No late night eating-all food is ingested before 5:30PM at the latest. 

Last thing I’m not doing-letting my money go to waste. I pay $650 a month (Lilly coupon due to lack of insurance coverage) and I refuse to spend money that quite frankly I really don’t have on a drug that I’m not going to put any effort into. 

The drug is an absolute miracle, however, I would like to use my experience to give some people some hope because I’ve seen some posts about people not losing weight as fast as they would like to. Keep the diet and exercise and reduction of bad habits in mind and you WILL SUCCEED! Head up and do your best! ",2,1736865712.0,Zepbound,8,0.75,False

However, my teenage daughter bought me a Mr. Coffee® 4-Shot Steam Espresso Machine, Cappuccino Maker, and Latte Maker for Christmas (ostensibly because she wanted it, lol).  It is definitely entry level which is okay until the kids move out. 
However, I cannot for the life of me figure out what size the filter it has so I can pick up a couple extra as well as a decent tamper, etc. I have read the manual and spent several hours looking online (apparently not in the right place though).

I have fallen down the research rabbit hole and am now in analysis paralysis, so would welcome suggestions regarding:
1)  A frother that can handle a wider variety of liquids (I.e. not just dairy) and that can do hot or cold froths.
2) I’ve seen paper “filters” that lay on top of the espresso powder to help keep the machine c lean. Are these a gimmick or actually recommended? They are not mentioned in the manual and I’ve not seen them discussed in this subreddit.
3) Does anyone have suggestions on a stand with storage to set the machine on? I’d like to be able to store the accessories in a drawer/cubby under the machine and allow for a taller milk pitcher under the steamer as this one is very restrictive which has resulted in dear daughter “cleaning up” a lot of milk messes.
5) Any great espresso based drink recipe books (non- alcoholic) that would be appropriate for a teenage birthday gift. I’d love to put together an accessory gift box for her upcoming birthday.
4) Also looking for a good, bad joint friendly, fresh whip maker (preferably that can do hot and cold) for topping steamed milk hot cocoa with fresh whipped cream as my fingers are wary of constantly hand washing my mixer/whisks. 

Also open to any other ideas/suggestions appropriate for a family new on the home brewed espresso journey.

We had been messaging on Instagram (and maybe kik at that time) for about a year before realizing we would be going to the same catholic high school come the fall and we both could not be more excited yet nervous yet giddy, all while trying to act cool and nonchalant about it. At that point we had sexted a bit and definitely told each other we liked each other. 

Flash forward to the first few weeks of freshman year and we decided to start dating. It was really sweet and pretty innocent and in the six months we dated we never did more than hold hands and hug and cuddle on the couch in his basement. 

We ended up breaking up because he was into one of our mutual friends and I just wasn't feeling it anymore in a romantic way. 

Flash forward again to my sophomore year of hs and I started dating D. D and I are still dating to this day (broke up for a bit in college) and we now live in another city in the US that we've moved to post-college. 

I'm so happy and we've talked about getting engaged and going to look at rings soon which I'm so beyond happy about - he's the one and I know it.

The only issue is I've been having dreams about my hs ex. Like alot. Like can't wait to go to sleep some nights so I can hang out with him and see him in my dreams. I think it's because we were more best friends than bf/gf at the time and I just feel so nostalgic about our relationship. I saw on social media that he recently moved to the same city I live in now and cant help but think we'll run into each other at some point.

My current bf hates this guy - I think because they're similar in some ways but wildly different in others... my current bf just doesn't like him as a person.

I’m taking a course of Xifaxan and was prescribed 8 weeks of a PPI which I haven’t started yet. I was also advised to do low FODMAP for a while to see if I could identify triggers so I’m doing that. When consulting with a registered dietitian she suggested that low stomach acid was a common root cause of SIBO-H, and can paradoxically also cause reflux. I did the bicarb test and didn’t burp at all except for in the first 30 seconds, maybe swallowed air. Going to re-do with a straw and new box of bicarb. 

I’ve read a lot of conflicting info about low stomach acid. It’s either *way* under recognized and treated as a cause OR an overblown new internet fad diagnosis with specious evidence and dubious at home tests. 

I know you can swallow a little measuring device too. How likely is this? What kind of doctors are you working with? Will my GI eyeroll me out of the room?

Endo & colonoscopy clear except some very mild reflux esophagitis. 

I’m taking a course of Xifaxan and was prescribed 8 weeks of a PPI which I haven’t started yet. I was also advised to do low FODMAP for a while to see if I could identify triggers so I’m doing that. When consulting with a registered dietitian she suggested that low stomach acid was a common root cause of SIBO-H, and can paradoxically also cause reflux. I did the bicarb test and didn’t burp at all except for in the first 30 seconds, maybe swallowed air. Going to re-do with a straw and new box of bicarb. 

I’ve read a lot of conflicting info about low stomach acid. It’s either *way* under recognized and treated as a cause OR an overblown new internet fad diagnosis with specious evidence and dubious at home tests. 

I know you can swallow a little measuring device too. How likely is this? What kind of doctors are you working with? Will my GI eyeroll me out of the room? FWIW, I do sometimes see undigested food in the toilet, and I have very low ferritin and high homocysteine which may indicate an absorption issues for iron and B vitamins. Thanks for any insight!

I followed up with my family doctor due to his advice who after a short conversation and a few self tests agreed that I may have ADHD.

He gave me prescription for 5 MG of  immediate release Adderall but told me to start with half a pill (2.5mg) and work up. Long story short over a period of 3 days I did 2.5 MG, 5 MG, and then 7.5 MG. All of those doses I felt absolutely nothing.

On the 4th day I took two pills (10 MG total). Jesus, it was like I had drank to much coffee that day. I definitely had a lot of energy (no anxiety with it though!) but I sure didn't feel any difference focus wise or talking wise. In fact, I talked to a few people that day and just went on and on. 

At this point I'm wondering if I even have ADHD, OR is it possible that you can have ADHD but one stimulant only kind of jack you up but not help with any of the actual symptoms? I'm unsure if I should talk to my doctor to ask for a different type or just take this as a sign I don't have ADHD. It seems like every post I read on here has people saying that if you truly have ADHD that stimulants don't give you energy they do the opposite. Well that was not the case for me.

One last thing to mention quickly though. I did not have any anxiety while I was ""jacked up"", however I did experience anxiety when the medication wore off. Not sure if that makes sense or not?

Many of you have also asked for a place to discover brewing recipes for specific beans.

We're happy to announce a new community-driven resource to address these needs! Introducing a platform where people can share the beans they've brewed and the recipes they've used.

# How it works:

**1. Submit your brews:** Share your favorite coffees and brewing parameters using this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/yAxGKATMwKeL7Xmy8). The form collects:

* Basic details about the beans (roaster, roast date, etc.)
* Your brewing recipe (e.g., dose, yield, shot time)
* Equipment used
* You do not need a Google account to fill out the form and no personal information will be collected.

**2. Explore the database:** View all submissions in a [publicly accessible Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dUpWjrkeTVPtIuSVmvjXrt7zq-E_wYg-0e9JMl_glNA/edit?usp=sharing).

* Use filters (e.g., Roaster's country, Cost-per-unit-weight) by selecting **Data > Create filter view** in the toolbar.
* Note: The spreadsheet is view-only and updates automatically with new submissions. You can download or copy it, but those versions won't receive updates.

**Tip:** For the best experience, view the spreadsheet on a desktop browser.

# Our goal:

We hope this grows into an invaluable resource for the community—a way to share your favourite coffees and provide others with a reference point to kickstart their brews. This is your chance to contribute to (and benefit from) a collaborative coffee knowledge base!

Let us know if you have suggestions for improving the form or the database.

Happy brewing!

for some context, my moms (F37) maiden name is Mary Murphy and my dads (M49) name is Dave Miller. my name (F18) is Brianna Santiago, but when i was born it was Brianna Torres. my parents changed it when i was young, but i was old enough to have already learned to spell Santiago and all that. so my whole life i’ve had suspicions abt my dad not being my dad for a few reasons. 
1. my last name 
2. i asked my grandpa (moms dad)  when i was young (about 5 or 6) if my dad was my dad, and he said “that’s for your mom to tell you” 
3. i asked my older half brother (M24) (on my dads side) when i was young (also 5 or 6 which would make him about 12) if he held me when i was a baby and he told me he didn’t meet me till i was 2. 
i didn’t wanna say anything bc if it wasn’t true and Dave really was my dad, id look stupid. i’ve asked my mom where my last name came from (again about age 5 or 6) and she told me she made it up and i believed her. i never spoke about it again to them. for a few weeks now, ive been thinking that i was gonna talk to my mom abt it since im 18 now. i came to work this morning and talked to a few coworkers about it (they are both in their 40 or 50s and one of them, Ellie, sort of knew my mom). when i told them, Ellie said “yeah i knew your mom was with someone else and had you before she got with Dave” and im like holy shit. so i texted my older brother (the one i mentioned before) and asked if he knew, and he said yes, but he didn’t think it mattered, and that they all love me like blood. on my lunch break i went on my facebook blocked list and saw a guy named “Mario Torres” was blocked. and i didn’t do it. so i was like wow this is my dad. i went through his whole facebook and looked at his new family. He has one daughter and they live on a farm with horses. he graduated in 1988 tho, which is one year after my mom was born, making him about 17 years older than my mom. should I reach out? should i talk to my mom THEN reach out? or should i not reach out at all? 




****UPDATE***

i was going to talk to my mom that night but she works nights and had already left for work when i got home. so i talked to her tonight. i asked her to tell me the story of my real dad. she told me he was abusive and beat the shit out of me and her. he also kept track of her miles to make sure she wasn’t cheating and would hit her if she went over her “limit”, even if it was to just get a coffee. there’s a lot of other details and stories she told me but i’ll keep it short. he was very very controlling and abusive. my mom left & Dave adopted me when i was 3 and has been my dad since. when me & my mom were talking she’s like “i knew you might hate me for keeping it from you for 18 years & i didn’t want you to hold a grudge against your dad” & i just explained that im not mad at either of them. just my bio dad. and ts js makes me respect Dave so much more bc he didn’t have to be my dad. he chose me yk. i then showed my mom Mario’s profile and told her this is how i found him. and she’s like “idk who that is” MARIO WAS NOT MY DAD LMFAOOO. so i asked what his name was and she told me Luis Santiago. so why Mario was blocked idk but i looked up Luis and he hasn’t posted in a few years, but i found his kids, my siblings, on social media. i texted my sister (F24) on instagram, which she hasn’t replied to. i texted my brother (M20) on messenger, which he also hasn’t replied to yet, and i also texted my oldest brother (M26) on messenger & he replied right away. He’s super cool & we’ve been texting but my mom doesn’t know obviously. 


***UPDATE #2***

after a few days of texting my brother, he invited me to his house to meet him. obviously i’m not comfortable with this man, considering i don’t know him, so i made sure i brought protective items and told a few of my friends where i was going and what i was doing, along with sharing my location with them. i didn’t necessarily think anything bad was gonna happen, but i was still scared bc i was going to meet up with a 26 year old man in his house alone. anyways i went and we just talked for a few hours. he told me he remembers me and my mom living with them, but thought my mom was already pregnant when she started coming around. this confused me but as soon as i found out Dave wasn’t my dad, i ordered an ancestry kit with priority processing. i got the kit 2 weeks later, spit in the tube, and sent it back. it arrived at the lab a few days ago, so now i wait 2-4 weeks to get my results. anyways, im not gonna freak out about that yet, because i have test results coming soon, and he was only about 8 years old. after talking for a while, we realized his best friend is my step brother (M24). my- who i thought was my dad, Dave, got divorced with mom and married to another woman, who had an older son. he then called my step brother to tell him, and he said he already knew, and thought my brother knew. as of right now, my brother and i snap often, and hung out just that one time. i’m just waiting for my ancestry results to confirm that Luis is in fact my father, and then to also just learn more about the parts of my life that i didn’t know. anyways, i know this has been long, and don’t know what i expect from anyone reading. i guess i just want some advice or what would you do. i can update after my results, if that’s something anyone is interested in hearing. thank you for reading and giving me feedback and advice. all is appreciated.

1i17a1q,https://www.deel.com/blog/woop-goal-setting/,How to Turn Your New Year’s Resolutions into Achievable Goals with the WOOP Strategy,"**TL;DR**: The WOOP strategy (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan) is a research-backed framework that helps you turn New Year’s resolutions into realistic, actionable goals. It’s been proven to help individuals overcome obstacles and stay on track, and it can be a game-changer for anyone looking to make lasting progress in the new year.

---

As we start a new year, many of us are setting New Year’s resolutions, goals, or ambitions. However, by the time February rolls around, it’s all too common for those resolutions to fall by the wayside. So, what’s missing? Why is it so difficult to follow through on the commitments we make at the start of the year?

One reason is that setting goals without a clear, actionable plan often leads to frustration. Goals can feel overwhelming, or we can become distracted by obstacles. But what if there were a way to not only set goals but also create a plan that addresses the inevitable challenges that arise along the way?

Enter **WOOP**—a strategy developed by psychologist Gabriele Oettingen. WOOP (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan) is an evidence-based framework that takes a more realistic approach to goal-setting by combining positive thinking with strategic planning. Unlike traditional goal-setting approaches, which focus primarily on the end result, WOOP emphasizes preparing for obstacles and creating a plan to overcome them.

Let’s dive into how the WOOP strategy works:

### 1. **Wish**: Define Your Goal  
The first step in the WOOP process is to clearly define a **wish** or goal. This should be a meaningful, specific, and achievable goal that is aligned with your values and what you want to achieve in the new year. The more precise you are with your wish, the easier it will be to create an actionable plan.  
For example, instead of saying, “I want to be more productive,” you could say, “I want to complete my major projects at least one week ahead of deadline this year.”

### 2. **Outcome**: Visualize the Best Possible Result  
Once you've identified your goal, the next step is to focus on the **outcome**. This involves visualizing the best possible result of achieving your goal. It’s important to think about how it will feel, how it will impact your work, your relationships, or your personal growth.  
In the productivity example, the outcome might be: “I’ll feel more in control, reduce my stress levels, and gain recognition from my team for consistently meeting deadlines.” By vividly imagining the positive impact of your success, you’ll cultivate motivation to keep working towards your goal.

### 3. **Obstacle**: Recognize Potential Barriers  
No goal is without obstacles. The next step is to identify potential **obstacles**—internal or external challenges that might stand in the way of achieving your goal.  
This part is often overlooked in traditional goal-setting but is a crucial part of the WOOP strategy. Acknowledging obstacles upfront gives you a realistic understanding of what might derail your progress, allowing you to prepare and stay focused when setbacks arise.  
For the example above, possible obstacles could include a lack of time, distractions, or procrastination.

### 4. **Plan**: Create an If-Then Strategy  
The final step is to create a clear **plan** to overcome those obstacles. This is where the “if-then” strategy comes into play. For every obstacle you’ve identified, you’ll create a contingency plan to keep yourself on track.  
For example, “If I find myself distracted by emails or meetings, then I’ll set aside one hour each morning to focus solely on my projects before anything else.”  
This planning stage helps you move from abstract ideas to practical steps that can help you stay committed to your goal, even when things don’t go according to plan.

### The Science Behind WOOP  
Why does WOOP work? Research shows that mental contrasting (the process of visualizing both the positive outcomes and potential obstacles) can enhance goal achievement. This strategy activates the brain’s cognitive resources to deal with challenges effectively.  
Additionally, studies have shown that WOOP can increase self-regulation, making it easier to control impulses and maintain focus. In one study, participants who used the WOOP strategy showed significantly more progress in achieving their goals compared to those who didn’t.

### Pairing WOOP with Habit Stacking  
One of the most effective ways to make WOOP even more powerful is to combine it with **habit stacking**. Habit stacking, popularized by James Clear in *Atomic Habits*, involves pairing a new habit with an existing one. When combined with WOOP, this approach helps you integrate new goals into your daily routine.  
For example, if your goal is to develop a habit of daily meditation, you could stack it with an existing habit, such as drinking your morning coffee. Your WOOP plan might look like this:  
- **Wish**: I want to meditate daily.  
- **Outcome**: I’ll feel calmer, more focused, and better equipped to handle stress.  
- **Obstacle**: I often forget or don’t make time for it.  
- **Plan**: If I drink my morning coffee, then I will meditate for 5 minutes immediately after.

### Neurodiversity-Affirming Strategies for WOOP  
For those of us who may have ADHD or other neurodivergent traits, WOOP can be further adapted to accommodate unique cognitive styles. For instance, you might use visual reminders (like sticky notes or mind maps) to reinforce the “if-then” plans, or incorporate sensory cues to trigger your planned actions. Some may also find that breaking down goals into smaller, more manageable tasks (micro-goals) can help make the process feel less overwhelming.

### Real-Life Applications  
I’ve personally seen WOOP help clients from a variety of backgrounds, including executives, entrepreneurs, and students, effectively tackle both personal and professional challenges. One client used WOOP to successfully manage the launch of a new product while balancing a demanding work schedule. Another client used WOOP to overcome procrastination and complete a long-postponed writing project.

### Final Thoughts  
WOOP is a powerful tool for anyone looking to turn their resolutions into sustainable actions. It provides a framework for not only setting meaningful goals but also for anticipating challenges and developing strategies to overcome them. By visualizing success, identifying obstacles, and creating actionable plans, you give yourself the best chance at achieving your aspirations.

What are your New Year’s resolutions for 2025? Have you tried WOOP or another strategy to turn your goals into concrete actions? I’d love to hear your experiences and discuss how WOOP can help you make lasting progress.

- Decrease in anhedonia (world seem much more interesting) 

- There is no coffee crash for some reason (my mood is stable till I go to sleep) 


BUT 

After a week or two of daily drinking there is 100% tolerance to this effect and I start to get BACKWARDS, despite drinking coffee daily I experience MORE anhedonia and indifferent feeing than before I did my first cup.

I’m a full time writer so the idea of quitting always felt sacrilegious. How could I function without my 3 heaped scoops in the morning? Now that I’m through the thick of the withdrawals, pretty well, it turns out.

The irritability, low mood, headaches, and brain fog passed around the 2 week mark. I added in extra b vitamins and l-theanine on the days it felt the worst (days 4-7 mostly), and I already take a multivitamin with a fish oil supplement. Otherwise, I just sat with the feeling and knew it would eventually pass.

Now when I can’t sleep, it’s because I can’t sleep, not because I’m wired from the caffeine come down, and those nights are less frequent than before. I’m dreaming again. A lot! The first week was filled with ‘they’re coming to get you’ dreams, but now they’re back to being plain old whacky. Also, my emotions feel less numbed? 

The urge to give up and crawl into bed at 3pm has gone. I wouldn’t say I’m bursting with energy (getting out of bed has never been easy for me, caffeine or not) but the energy I do have is more consistent throughout the day, tapering off naturally. If I get out in sunlight and exercise, I feel even better.

This all started because I was so busy over Christmas that I forgot to drink coffee one day and noticed I slept better. That sent me to this sub, and reading all the anecdotes from people on the other side gave me the push to commit to this.

I’ve previously quit weed and stimulants, and coffee was the last guard between me and seeing what I’d be like without the extra razzle dazzle to get me going. My life has enough external stressors without habitually adding them internally.

I like this calmer feeling.

If you’re thinking of quitting, give it a go. If you’re struggling, keep going. If you miss the ritual and the routine, I’ve been enjoying rooibos lattes with frothy milk and honey to sweeten.

Hey everyone!

I’m excited to share my personal collection of underrated fragrances that I believe deserve more recognition. Many of these gems are lowkey where I live, but they offer amazing scents that are definitely worth checking out. Whether you’re a fragrance enthusiast or just looking to expand your collection with something unique, I hope you find this list insightful. Here’s a detailed rundown of each fragrance, along with my ratings and why I love them:

  


**Fogg Collection**



Fogg is an Indian fragrance brand known for its affordable yet quality offerings. Despite their popularity in certain regions, they remain relatively unknown in other parts of the world. Fogg consistently produces a variety of scents catering to different preferences, making them a hidden treasure for fragrance lovers.

1. **Oud Extreme**

• **Rating:** 8.5/10

• **Notes:** Rich oud blended with spicy and woody undertones, including hints of saffron and amber.

• **Fragrance Family:** Oriental Woody

• **Why I Love It:** Oud Extreme is a bold and luxurious scent that stands out with its deep and complex composition. It’s perfect for evening wear or special occasions, offering a sense of sophistication and elegance. The longevity is impressive, lasting throughout the day without being overpowering. It also projects well, making a noticeable yet refined statement.

2. **Impressio (Blue)**

• **Rating:** 8.2/10

• **Fragrance Family:** Aquatic Floral

The scent is light yet enduring, providing a clean and invigorating aroma that’s perfect for both casual and semi-formal settings.

3. **Xpressio**

• **Rating:** 6/10

• **Notes:** A blend of aromatic herbs, subtle sweetness from vanilla, and a hint of woody base.

• **Fragrance Family:** Aromatic Fougere

• **Why I Rate It This:** While Xpressio is decent, it doesn’t stand out as much as the other fragrances in the Fogg line. It’s suitable for casual settings but lacks the complexity and uniqueness I seek in a signature scent. The sweetness from the vanilla is pleasant but not particularly memorable.

4. **Intensio (Green)**

• **Rating:** 2/10

• **Notes:** Predominantly green notes with a touch of earthiness and mild herbal accents.

• **Fragrance Family:** Green Aromatic

• **Why I Rate It This:** Unfortunately, Intensio (Green) didn’t resonate with me. The scent felt too muted and lacked the depth and richness I was hoping for. It’s more suited for those who prefer subtle and understated fragrances, but it didn’t meet my expectations for versatility and longevity.

  


**Versace Eros EDT**

• **Rating:** 7.8/10

• **Notes:** Fresh citrus with mint, green apple, and tonka bean, layered over a base of geranium and ambroxan.

I find it smells even better in colder weather, where the crisp and invigorating aroma shines through.

It’s an easy 7.8/10 for its adaptability and pleasant scent profile.

• **Notes:** Fresh and fruity with notes of ginger, citrus, and amber, complemented by a base of woody and musky accords.

• **Fragrance Family:** Woody Spicy

• **Why I Love It:** Jimmy Choo Men EDT is a fantastic everyday scent that’s fresh yet impactful. The ginger adds a spicy kick, while the citrus provides a bright and energetic opening. The amber and woody base ensure the fragrance remains warm and inviting throughout the day. Its longevity is solid, maintaining its freshness from morning to night. It’s subtle enough for the office but stands out enough for social settings, making it a versatile addition to any collection.

  


**Dior Sauvage Elixir**

• **Notes:** Spicy and woody with prominent notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and sandalwood, enriched with a hint of lavender and grapefruit.

Although the longevity could be better, the overall aroma is exceptional, offering a balance of sweetness and earthiness that appeals to a wide range of preferences. It’s a worthy addition to any collection, especially for those who appreciate high-quality, niche fragrances.

  


**Top Two Favorites**



**Azzaro The Most Wanted**

• **Rating:** 9.4/10

• **Why I Love It:** Azzaro The Most Wanted is perfect for the cold weather season, offering a strong and mature scent that exudes confidence. The blend of spices and woody notes creates a rich and captivating aroma, while the amber and leather add depth and warmth.

• **Rating:** 9.7/10

• **Notes:** Coffee, leather, spicy notes, with undertones of amber and woody accords.

• **Fragrance Family:** Oriental Woody

• **Why I Love It:** Polo Red Extreme is by far my favorite fragrance. It has a rich, coffee-infused aroma that’s both unique and versatile, making it suitable for any occasion. The coffee notes add a robust and invigorating element, while the leather and spices provide a smooth and sophisticated finish. It’s perfect for both day and night, offering excellent longevity and sillage. I was sad to see it discontinued, as it’s a standout scent that balances complexity with wearability. If you get a chance to find it, I highly recommend adding it to your collection!

Whether you’re looking for something fresh for daily wear, a bold statement for special occasions, or a versatile scent that transitions seamlessly from day to night, there’s something here for everyone. Here are a few additional insights to consider when exploring these fragrances:

• **Application Tips:**

• **Pulse Points:** Apply fragrances to pulse points like wrists, neck, and behind the ears to enhance the scent’s projection and longevity.

• **Layering:** Experiment with layering fragrances to create a personalized scent that suits your mood and the occasion.

• **Moderation:** Start with a small amount to gauge how the fragrance interacts with your skin chemistry before applying more.

• **Storage Tips:**

• **Cool, Dark Place:** Store your fragrances in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight and temperature fluctuations to preserve their integrity.

• **Original Packaging:** Keeping them in their original boxes can help protect them from light and air exposure, ensuring they last longer.

• **Choosing the Right Fragrance:**

• **Consider the Occasion:** Select fragrances based on the occasion—lighter, fresher scents for daily wear and deeper, more intense ones for evenings or special events.

• **Seasonal Preferences:** Some fragrances perform better in certain seasons. For example, fresh and aquatic scents are great for summer, while woody and spicy notes are ideal for fall and winter.

**Looking Ahead: Expanding into Niche Fragrances**

During my employment i had created a rewards account with 7brew. and i was told that we need 100% loyalty when taking orders. so you ask each customer if they have an account or if they want an account. if they do you enter in their phone number, if not i was told you could enter your own. i was then told by a shift lead that we aren't allowed to do that ANYMORE. so i obliged. i was then, literally the next day i was fired for ""stealing from the company"" they apparently had a zero tolerance policy and it was effective immediately. i had explained that i was told that was okay and multiple brewista and shift leads use their numbers on cars who don't have rewards accounts. i was told i should've known about it since it was in the handbook in the group chat. and i was supposed to know this because i got trained right?  who should i contact? how do i get my job back? i feel like i was fired due to the lack of their training and communication.

I really don't understand what is happening but basically my second and third shots of the morning are 5-10 seconds than the first. This happens with more than one bag/type of beans although it seems more pronounced with darker roasts. I have had the machine for a year and it seems like over time this has become more noticeable. I'd like to have more consistency between pulls, like 1-2 seconds. I use WDT, Niche Zero grinder, 18g in a bottomless portafilter, usually medium beans. For instance this morning I did 18g coffee, 36g espresso, times ranged from 35 seconds for the first shot down to around 27 for the third. I do the same process for each shot. My understanding is that most people have the opposite problem, if anything, where the first shot is fastest. I don't really know what else to try. I do normally have milk-based drinks so it's not that big of a deal but it would be nice if I didn't have such large ranges of time for brewing.  Any thoughts would be appreciated!

1i174rs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i174rs,I got dumped for 2025,"Yep, going into the new year single. My ex-partner of 2.5 years dumped me the weekend after new years. 

We just last night finished moving out the last batch of their stuff, and I’m now left with an empty hollow apartment. 
The real kicker is that my goal was always to buy a home, and together we had been putting in offers pre-breakup. 

Needless to say because I wanted to move out I had not been putting too much love into this crappy apartment, but I could really use a cozy space these days. 

Please help. What would be your first change?
I was thinking of swapping the coffee table with one of those cute “cloud shape” irregular ones in a light wood colour. 

Ideally I’d love to have floor length curtains but we have floor baseboard heaters so not sure if that’s a fire hazard. 

I’ve also been contemplating changing the carpet to a white/burnt orange checkerboard. 

I’ll also be getting more mood lighting.

I guess my main questions are 

1. Because the space is so small, should I put a second carpet under the “dining” table set? 
If I get the checkered carpet for in front of the couch, should I move the white carpet under the dining table?
The thing is old and we found it free on marketplace. Initially my ex and I were going to sand it down and refinish it and stain it a new colour, but I doubt I’ll be doing that on my own now. Maybe a table cloth? Though I’m not really a fan. 

2. What should I do with the empty wall by the bookshelf? My partner had had their work desk there. I do work from home occasionally but not often enough to warrant a whole desk I don’t think.
I was thinking maybe a little yoga station? But it’s kinda awkward and small. Would you flip the bookshelf to be facing out? 
Also how would you decorate the wall with artwork?

I just want to know your opinion if it’s considered enough already or kulang pa for 50-60 pax guests. For cocktail hour, with estimated duration of 1hr while we’re doing our post-nup shoot, we availed:

1) sorbetes cart (covers 75)
2) coffee cart (50 pax)
3) grazing table with kakanin and sliders (good for 50 pax) and with unli juice

For non-food activities naman, we have:

1) Photo Booth 
2) selfie mirror

Is it enough or should I add more food cart or just upgrade the grazing for 70 pax? Or should I just add another non-food activity which is audio guest book?
