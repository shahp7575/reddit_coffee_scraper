1g9xwqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/PanganaySupportGroup/comments/1g9xwqe/naawa_ako_na_naiinis_sa_kapatid_ko/,Naawa ako na naiinis sa kapatid ko,"TLDR: Mabait kapatid ko pero mabigat, at kahit gusto ko siyang tulungan, napupuno na ako

Halos 30 edad niya, malapit lang kami. 

Naalala ko noong may children's party na may game. Gusto kong manalo so I competed with other kids, including my kapatid. Tapos after ng game, pinagalitan ako ng parents ko kasi dapat daw never kong iwanan kapatid ko. Dapat daw nagtutulungan kaming manalo. 

Sobrang tumatak sakin yung araw na yon. In the next children's games over the years, lagi kong iniisip muna kapatid ko instead of striving to win. 

I'm academically gifted, he's mostly average pero ang biggest difference is the attitude. I pushed through college, he dropped out. Kahit afford namin college niya, siya mismo umayaw para mag work na agad. 

Fast forward adult years. Ako nagtiis sa corporate kahit hindi ko passion. Inuna ko pamilya ko, at kahit marami akong frustration sa personal life, comfortable ako at natutulungan ko parents. 

Siya, pursued his passion and ""diskarte"". Result? Walang pera, halos walang contribution sa bills. Ilang taon naman siya sinuportahan sa passion niya. Sinasagot mga gastos niya, hinahatid siya, kahit sa groceries binibilan ko siya. 

Yung kawalan ng pera is not my biggest issue, pero yung pagiging mahina niya sa gawaing bahay. Gagalaw lang pag inutusan mo. Grabeng mental labor kasi walang kusa. Tapos hindi natututo. Paulit-ulit ganun pa rin. He's a massive procrastinator, so minsan kahit sabihan mo, pag na distract na sa YouTube or games, ilang oras bago matapos. 

Pinagsasabihan naman siya ng parents. Long ago sobrang sinasabihan siya na bumalik sa college. Ayaw niya, and now fast forward to where we are. 

Na trigger ako noong isang gabi, umuwi ako na wala man lang sinaing para samin ni mama. Pasarap sarap siyang nanood ng Netflix. Tapos kahit gabing gabi na ako umuwi, hindi man lang tumulong magligpit at mag hugas.

Pag weekend wala siya dahil sa GF tumitira. Lahat ng laba, ligpit, luto, sa amin. 

This morning, I realized kumuha na naman siya ng mamahalin kong coffee. OK lang sakin na mag share pero problema parang inubos niya maraming sachets. Ilang beses na siyang food thief tapos kahit sabihin mo, ang assumed niya is para sa lahat daw kasi. 

Naawa ako kasi alam kong wala siyang pambili ng sarili niyang snacks, pero nagsasawa na ako sa ganito. 

Ilang beses na kami nag usap ng parents ko. Gentle love. Tough love. Nothing works sa kanya. Parang hindi niya kayang maging adult. Tumatanda na parents ko at natatakot akong hanggang retirement eh itong kapatid ko ay alalahanin nila. Dapat nag iipon na sila pero nag support pa rin sila ng adult na hindi kayang maging adult. 

Mahal ko kapatid ko, pero napapagod na ako na uuwi ako sa bahay na nabwiset sa kanya. 

Alam ko na sasabihin na lang lagi, ""palayasin na yan"". Pero that's out of the cards. Not my house, not my call. Like I said, mabait siya, wala naman siyang ginawang masama at hindi din siya pasaway at bastos sa magulang. Pero, feeling ko he's stuck at 17 years old na parang walang progress. Naabutan na siya ng maturity ng mga mas bata naming kapatid. 

Ayun, venting lang.

I had so much fun chatting and we seemed to have similar interests. I'm a work from home mom so it's hard to meet new people and Olivia was so much fun to talk to. I'd love to meet for coffee and chat more!

1. Make sure you practice your speaking skills no matter how good of an English speaker you are. I speak a fair amount of English (I used to work as a freelance writer) and still had to practice for a day or two. It's the nerves that's going to get you, so you have to know how to attack the Speaking Test properly. 

2. The testing center is going to be pretty darn noisy during the exam, because all of the test takers are going to be speaking at the same time. It's best if you practice speaking in a noisy environment without getting out of focus. I practiced Speaking for about an hour in a busy coffee shop, and sure enough, the exam center was just as loud. 

3. APEUni. I paid for a month's worth of their premium, but was only able to do mock tests for about 2 days, because I still had to go to work. And will get knocked out immediately after work. I suggest you do mock tests as much as you can. The exam is pretty similar to their mock tests.

4. Don't overthink it. It's an easy test, especially if you already have a good English background. If you don't, you can just study a week or two more.

- The characters would constantly drop cuss words every few sentences, especially Yang and Qrow.


- Weiss would be a full-blown racist towards Blake and the faunus. Constantly dropping racial slurs while saying that ""their kind"" don't belong in the Academies.


 - The White Fang would be a completely unredeemable terrorist group, much more violent than what was shown in the show.


- Team CRDL would be similar to Weiss where they are racists, and their teasing against Velvet would be full-on hate crimes.


- Glynda would be shown having an affair with one of the students, and Ozpin would turn a blind eye to it.


- Instead of coffee, Oobleck would be a cocaine addict trying to kick the habit.


- Cardin would not only blackmail Jaune, but beat him to a bloody pulp when Jaune stands up to him. He would also cocere Pyrrha into fucking him just for the lulz.


- Roman and the White Fang goons would rape Ruby when they had her captured.


- The Fall of Beacon is much more gruesome and hard to watch. Students are ripped apart by Grimm while the White Fang opened fire on any human they saw.


- Yang sleeps with every male in the academy and have to deal with slut-shaming as a consequence.


- Winter and Qrow would meet up after their fight and partake in a hardcore sex scene as a make-up for it.",1,1729644053.0,RWBYcritics,0,0.99,False

He’s about 34 so he’s in more of a rush to marry and have kids. Like I mentioned my highly dysfunctional is setting me up to leech off of them. I do genuinely like him and he’s very nice and supportive. He said if all works out I actually wouldn’t need to work if I don’t want to and stay with the baby if we have one. My grades are so bad cuz I had so many mental health leaves. I explained to colleges but they don’t really care and rejected me. He seems amazing and it feels strange meeting a guy on a dating app that actually appreciates me and not in discord or snap or something. Because of senior year I requested to just go out once to a month til about May when my grades are finalized and he was understanding.

1g9xoud,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1g9xoud/out_of_state_crush_experience_questions/,Out of State Crush experience & questions,"I'm a 20 F and my crush is 23/24 M. We met when we were kids in his state. (My family is a ministry that gets invited to different places to preach and play as a band.) but we didn't interact much until the second to last time I visited (2 years ago) for a couple of days. During this time, he would look at me a lot during service while he played his instrument, he would always greet me and compliment me on how great I played my instrument and would ask me if I needed help carrying my items. He also talked a lot about himself and even showed me videos from when he was little when he started learning music. Even tho I'm not great at maintaining conversation, he always tried to keep it going by talking about our shared interests.

Now, this last trip I saw him (few days ago) really left me feeling butterflies and all kinds of giddy emotions. I told myself I don't like him and that I wasn't gonna feel nervous. Context: I broke up from a toxic relationship almost a year ago, so I feel ready to date again, but I'm like a lot stricter with myself now as a cause of the hurt I went through. But anyways, after a service of playing and praising thE lOrd, it was time to eat food the sisters were serving. I acted like I just happened to pass by him and I greeted him by shaking hands. He told me ""Hey! God bless you. How have you been?"" (I said I'm good)  He continued ""You dipped on us last year."" And I was so frcking awkward and just said ""yeah, but I'm here now!"" And he was like ""Yeah, I didn't see you in (neighboring state) when your family came.. but I'm glad you're here now. Really, I am very pleased to see you,"" while beaming. I just smiled and replied ""thank you, likewise"" (translating from Spanish btw). Then after eating and talking with other people outside, a secondary service started with another invited group. After that 2nd service, I tried so hard to ignore him in plain sight cuz I didn't wanna look desperate and cuz I was avoidant to feeling butterflies. But I couldn't help it when he was literally sitting on the pulpit right behind my brother whom I was next to, and unless it's in my head, it was almost like he was waiting for me to talk to him? So I turned my head towards him and *there he was smiling at me again* 😵 and I feel so frcking stupid by how frcking wide my grin was. My face got so hot and I just extended my hand to him. I don't even remember most of what we talked about during those few minutes cuz I was so nervous (mom was there listening and watching). But what I can say is when we shook hands, he didn't let go of my hand while I was talking. He was making firm eye contact, looking up at me (I was standing) while I was talking. Then I pulled my hand away more gently than intended and it felt *caressed*. His skin felt eletrical. And during all that I felt a little tension 🤭🙂‍↔️ anyways, after that, I went outside for a little bit to look for my lil brother, and when I entered the church again, he was standing against a wall and was just looking at me with this sweet smile and kind look in his eyes without breaking contact 😭 🦋 I just made a cheeky smile back and hit his upper arm with the back of my hand as a passed by him to pick up my guitar. Then when I went in line to get a coffee there he was again. He asked me if I was in line and I was like ""yeah, my fam is waiting for me, I want a coffee"" in like a cute, whining expression 🤦‍♀️ he told me to stand in front of him (while my side is to his front) and the sisters will get me a coffee, then announced to the women in the kitchen that I need a coffee with no shame 😭 😭 and as I was waiting, someone was having small talk with him and I could see through my peripherals that he was glancing at me and looking at me up & down, omg.. I felt so much sexual tension. I haven't felt like that in so long.. he handed me the coffee and sweet bread with a smile and I left. More stuff happened the next day, but this post is getting long.

I guess I kinda wanted to get this off my chest (I don't want my friends or fam knowing), and I want to hear what people think abt this. Does he like me or is he just being nice in a friendly way? I love how gentle and sweet he is when interacting with me. I also love how well he treats others and how he gets along with my parents. Even my sister likes him, and she doesn't like anybody! I don't think this is something I could pursue even if I wanted to, but I enjoyed the experience and I hope I can soon with someone who makes me feel this way. I'm sorry abt this cheesy and childish, long post!! I feel like I'm 15 all over again 😭

I was baptized Protestant when I was 21, but I will have to receive a conditional baptism because I had no witnesses that I knew and I do not remember who performed my baptism (the responsibility changed hands after I left).

I have done a lot of sin in my life within the past 8 years and I want to atone for it. I was strongly inspired by the stories of the medieval saints, how many of them would deprive themselves of food and sleep (which is a bold move in an era before coffee).

I was also touched by the story of Our Lady of Fatima, and the three shepherd children. I deeply admired the fact that three innocent children had offered up their sufferings to God in reparation for the sins committed against Jesus and Our Lady. Their hunger for immolation is incredible! They would wear abrasive ropes around their waists, they would prostrate themselves with their heads on the floor for hours while praying (it starts to hurt pretty shortly!), and Jacinta offered the pain she felt when she had Spanish Flu to God, to help convert sinners. Not only do I want to perform acts of penance and suffering for myself, but for others also.

However, I’m not Catholic yet. I won’t be until Easter. Will God even recognize my sacrifices and interior penances? If I purposely abstain from all animal products on days of abstinence, go to Mass every day even when it is painful, deprive myself of sleep, self-immolate (e.g. tying a rope or a bar wire around my waist, not drinking water when I’m hot, etc.), pray a full rosary every day, and give up something major for Advent this year, will it be all for nothing? I don’t care if the reward doesn’t go to me. I wish to be like the kids at Fatima. I desire my sacrifices to mean *something*.

1g9xmvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g9xmvp/wyrms/,Wyrms,"I didn't expect my camping trip to be the nightmare that it was. My high school friend Mark and I have had this tradition of hiking up and camping at Mount Alto in our old hometown since we both turned eighteen. It was a bit of a hassle to plan it every year now that we were adults and had to work around our jobs, but we always pulled it off. We both thought this visit was the most needed out of all of them though. 

Three months ago, Mark's mother succumbed to the cancer that was eating away at her pancreas, and just a few weeks ago my live-in girlfriend Andrea and I decided not only did our ship sail, but it crashed on the rocks. I moved back home with my dad as it was Andrea's apartment I was staying in, and Mark also moved back in with his father in his time of grief, since he was an only child and there was no one else to be around him. 


It had been a while since our last discussion about it, but we were finally able to pack all of our camping gear into Mark's truck and head down the old dirt road that led to the mountain. I can still feel the refreshing breeze of the hot summer air on my face as we rolled down the windows and Mark lowered the volume of the 90s grunge rock music blaring from the truck radio to flash me a grin.


""We made it, just a few more minutes and we'll be at Camp Shangri-la. You did remember to bring toilet paper this time, right?"" He chuckled, his southern accent adding to the light-heartedness of the moment as he jokingly slapped my thigh. I let out a groan and shot him a playful smirk in return, tired of hearing the same old joke.


""Four years ago, man, four years. You're not going to let me live down the whole poison ivy incident, huh?"" I jokingly echoed his playful pat on the leg. ""I'll make you a deal, buddy. I'll hide the toilet paper this time. That way, you can experience what it's like to have a swollen, blistering, asscrack."" 


We both shared a laugh and carried on with our banter, but my thoughts kept drifting back to the recent turmoil between my girlfriend and me. It had only been a few weeks since everything happened, and I knew that healing would take time. The wound on my heart was still fresh, and the shock of it all lingered in my mind. We had been inseparable, crazy about each other. Six years back, we were just two carefree youngsters who crossed paths at a dive bar during a friend's gig. A few coffee dates later, and sparks flew between us. She was the one person who truly got me, and we had a seamless companionship. But when an unexpected pregnancy led to a heartbreaking miscarriage, everything changed. Grief wedged its way between us, causing a gradual drift. I couldn't pinpoint blame on either of us, but the shared loss acted as a silent barrier, pushing us apart.


I glanced over at Mark, his gaze fixed on the rough dirt road ahead as we ascended the familiar hill. His thoughts, however, seemed to have drifted back to the music playing on the radio, evidenced by his off-key singing. As I observed him, I couldn't help but admire his ability to push aside any emotional turmoil, even if it was just for a weekend. The pain of losing a girlfriend paled in comparison to the devastating loss of his mother, who had been a beacon of love and support not just for him, but for all his friends who visited their home. I remembered a time from our childhood when we were both twelve years old and faced a bully at school; while my parents were unable to intervene due to work commitments, Mark's mother fearlessly confronted the issue with the school administration on our behalf. 

However, fate was cruel, and within a short span of time after being diagnosed with cancer, she succumbed to the illness, leaving a void in their family that could never be filled. Cancer had snatched away a truly remarkable soul. As I dwelled on these memories, lost in my thoughts, I suddenly realized that Mark had brought the truck to a stop, silencing the engine.

""We've arrived, dude,"" he exclaimed, his grin spreading from ear to ear. Tossing his sandy blonde locks back from his face, he retrieved some of the smaller camping bags from the backseat. I gazed out the window, unfastening my seatbelt, feeling a wave of peace wash over me as I took in the forested area on my right. This was our sanctuary, our escape from the world. Stepping out of the car, I planted a foot on the pine cone and bark-strewn ground, immediately greeted by the symphony of birdsong and the sweet scent of nature. A sense of serenity enveloped me as I surveyed the woods that now surrounded us. Over by the flatbed of the truck, I could hear Mark grunting as he struggled with our larger bags, tossing them to the ground. I glanced back at him, seeing him haul out the massive bag containing our tent.


""Hey, Mark, I'm gonna take a little walk around here while we're here, and take a leak. I'll lend a hand in a bit,"" I called out, already making my way towards a tree to do so.


""Sure thing"" I heard Mark call out as I strode down the gentle slope into the forest. ""Take it all in and let it all out,"" he added with a chuckle, amused by his own words. I couldn't help but grin at his usual antics, shaking my head as I continued on, enjoying the crackling of twigs and pine needles under my boots. Reaching the base of the hill, I sought out a tree away from our campsite and began to relieve myself. Suddenly, a sound pricked my ears, a faint gasping coming from the nearby creek. It sounded like something struggling to catch their breath but trying to remain silent. Hastily finishing up, I zipped up my pants and cautiously made my way towards the source of the noise.


I could sense that the sound was coming from behind a large rock near the creek bed. However, as I approached, the noise surprisingly grew fainter instead of louder. Upon closer inspection, I discovered the tragic scene before me - a young fawn, mutilated and gasping for air. The deer's wide eyes held a look of fear and desperation as it struggled for breath. The lower half of its body was completely missing, with its entrails scattered on the ground and attracting flies. The remaining top half of the fawn bore small, bloody circular wounds that seemed to be from some sort of sharp object. Feeling overwhelmed and unsure of what to do, I called out for Mark. Even though I couldn't tear my eyes away from the horrific sight, I could hear the sound of Mark racing down the hill towards me.


""What the fuck?"" Mark exclaimed as he stood beside me, his voice trembling as he gazed at the gruesome sight before us.



""What should we do?"" I struggled to articulate, a wave of nausea washing over me as I observed the unfortunate creature. Mark scanned the area and located a hefty rock, lifting it above his head.


""We need to end its suffering,"" he gruffly declared, ""you might want to turn away."" I averted my gaze from the injured animal for the first time, and the sound of the rock Mark wielded striking the deer echoed through the air, putting an end to its agony.


""Jesus!"" Mark's exclamation startled me, prompting me to gaze back at the gruesome sight. Instead of a deer's head, all that remained was a flattened mass of flesh, teeth, and brains, with bright purple wriggling worms squirming within the brain tissue. These chubby purple creatures were nestled in the brain matter of the once-vibrant animal, moving their hairy, gelatinous bodies in a dance like they were at a party or in the throes of merriment.


""What in the hell are those?"" I shouted, taken aback by the unnerving sight of the worms. Mark stood there, wide-eyed, shaking his head in disbelief.


""I don't know. Perhaps some kind of parasite? I've heard that deer can contract a parasite that devours their brain, causing them to behave strangely,"" Mark mused. I turned away, unable to stomach the grotesque scene, and vomited, but Mark continued to talk as if oblivious to my distress. ""As for what may have happened, it could have been wolves. Not a bear, though. We don't have those in this area,"" he remarked, finally noticing my vomiting and offering a comforting pat on the back. ""I've made some progress with setting up the tent. Why don't you take a walk and gather firewood while I finish up? It might help you get some fresh air.""


I nodded, still hunched over and wiping away the drool from my mouth. ""Yeah, sure,"" I managed to say through a few more coughs. After ensuring that nothing else was going to come out of my stomach, I forced myself to move away. The nauseating sensation continued to permeate my body, my face flushing with heat and my stomach threatening to empty itself again. My arms felt heavy, and I had to will my legs to keep moving. It was like wading through thick water.

 I couldn't deny Mark's suggestion about those strange purple worms, but they were unlike anything I had ever encountered before. My knowledge of parasites was limited, but it just felt unnatural for something so repulsive and hairy to exist. Mark, being a veterinarian's assistant, had a good understanding of animals.


I recall visiting the clinic one day to have a lunch break with Mark. He introduced me to the doctor he had been assisting, and as soon as Mark spotted me, he hurriedly led me past the waiting room filled with people and their sick pets. We entered the doctor's office, where he introduced us to Doctor Albright. While Doctor Albright seemed friendly enough, the sight of a jar on his desk containing a dog's heart infested with heart worms was quite unsettling. I understood the concept of showcasing the reason behind the work being done, but the display had a disturbing quality that reminded me of scenes from a horror movie. Despite this, the shocking sight of the infected heart paled in comparison to the unsettling creature Mark and I had just witnessed emerging from the deer's head.


My thoughts were abruptly interrupted as I stumbled, my foot catching on a tree root along the edge of the creek. I tumbled to the ground, my head striking a rock. A flash of white light enveloped my vision, prompting me to shut my eyes against the pulsating pain. Tentatively reaching up to touch the point of impact on my forehead, I felt the dampness of a trickle of blood – just what I needed. Opening my eyes, I discovered that I hadn't collided with a rock, but rather a metal surface. Before me lay a sizable square concrete foundation encasing a large metal circular lid, reminiscent of a manhole cover, complete with handles on the sides.


""What in the fuck?"" I muttered aloud, struggling to stand up after the impact that left me disoriented. Bending down, I peered closer at the curious vent opening. Between the handles, which appeared designed for accessing whatever was concealed beneath, was a string of numbers and letters: '17439-HP10-4A'. Instead of clarifying its purpose, this alphanumeric sequence only piqued my interest further, compelling me to reach for one of the handles.


""Are you alright?"" Mark's concerned voice behind me interrupted my contemplation, causing me to turn and motion him over.


""Come take a look at this, I found something."" I called back, gesturing towards the mysterious lid. As Mark approached and observed the unusual opening, a look of bewilderment crossed his face.


""I don't know what it is, but I have a feeling whatever is below is just waiting for us to dive in on an adventure,"" I said with a touch of cheesy excitement. Mark chuckled and playfully rolled his eyes, motioning to grab the handle on the opposite side of me. Without hesitation, I reached out for the handle on my side as we both silently counted down from three, preparing to lift.


The lid was incredibly heavy, causing us to strain and grunt as we attempted to budge the metal covering. I felt a trickle of sweat mix with the blood from  the small cut above my eyebrow, but the adrenaline kept me pushing forward. As we continued to heave the weighty object, it eventually gave way and lifted, leaving Mark and me holding it just a few inches above the opening.


With a final effort, we carefully shifted the cover to the side on the ground, revealing the hidden depths beneath. Peering into the darkness, we both felt a surge of curiosity and anticipation.


In front of us, a gaping hole revealed a stainless steel staircase descending into darkness. The pitch black surroundings made it difficult to make out much  details, but the sunlight above hinted at an arching passageway just past the stairs leading further underground. I caught Mark's eyes, and he returned the silent exchange before gesturing for me to go first.


Turning to my pocket, I pulled out my cellphone and turned on the flashlight, disregarding the lack of service bars on my home screen. Stepping onto the metal staircase, each clang resonated loudly as I descended, Mark's steady steps echoing mine a few paces behind. His phone illuminated the space above my head as we ventured downward.


As I neared the bottom, my light swept over the doorless, expansive hallway, revealing only mundane concrete walls with a peculiar touch of black paint on either side of the entrance. The markings read ""SITE 17439-HP10-4A-A1,"" leaving us to wonder what awaited beyond.


I glanced back at Mark, who had his light fixed on the same lettering, shaking his head in bewilderment like me. Moving down the hallway, the feeble glow from my phone revealed a plain wooden door at the far end, adorned with a glass panel window that hinted at an office beyond, though visibility was scarce. My hand reached for the doorknob just as Mark's voice gave me pause.


""Wait."" I turned to find him standing behind me, the brightness of his phone obscuring his features. ""Maybe we should reconsider. This seems more heavy than we thought,"" he hesitated, ""like it could involve some shady government stuff. I don't want to get mixed up in legal trouble.""


I scoffed, ""Seriously? We've come this far, and besides, look inside."" Gesturing with my phone towards the window, I continued, ""It's just as dark in there as it is out here."" I turned the knob, feeling the door unlatch from the concrete wall. ""This place is deserted. No one knows we're here in the middle of nowhere in buttfuck Georgia, exploring some mysterious underground bunker,"" I declared, already stepping through the doorway.


Surveying the room, the once typical reception area now appeared desolate, as if hastily vacated. The sizable white desk, hosting two now-disconnected computers, had its drawers forcibly yanked open, eerily empty. The towers of the machines had been stripped bare, bereft of their hardware, leaving only hollow shells behind. A noticeable absence of grime on the walls hinted at where frames once held portraits or artworks now absent. Dark hallways stretched into the underground facility from each side, the darkness impenetrable from our vantage point.


 Adjacent to one corridor lay three overturned filing cabinets. Intrigued, I cautiously advanced further into the room, and my steps echoed in the unsettling silence. A damp squelch underfoot drew my attention downwards, and pointing my phone to the floor with my light, I discovered a small pool of a peculiar, gel-like substance. As I tried to lift my foot, the liquid resisted, its surface teeming with tiny, shifting bubbles. Examining my boot, I noticed a similar layer coating the sole, mirroring the bubbling activity beneath. Alerting Mark to the unusual sight, I directed his attention to the odd liquid clinging to my boot, seeking his thoughts.


""What's your take on this?"" I asked, prompting him to abandon the filing cabinets he was standing over and scrutinize the mysterious substance. His response was punctuated by a contemplative hum, suggesting deep thought.


""I dont know. It seems to look like the mucus left by a snail, but I can't be certain. Better not touch it,"" Mark cautioned, his eyes scanning the room for clues. ""I spotted something similar on one of the  filing cabinets, but I sure as hell didnt touch it.""


Directing my phone's light towards the cabinets he mentioned, I asked, ""Did you find anything in there?""


""No,"" he replied tersely. ""There wasn't a single file folder inside. What's even more peculiar is how spotless this place appears, despite its emptiness.""


Mark's observation was astute; the reception area, apart from the strange liquid I had encountered, was unusually clean for an abandoned location. There wasnt any dust, as if it had only been empty a short time, but suddenly a noise emanated from one of the hallways, jolting us from our thoughts. The sound of someone struggling for breath and grunting in pain reverberated through the silent air, prompting Mark to cast me an alarmed glance.


""Someone is still here"" Mark exclaimed urgently. Before I had a chance to reply, he sprinted down the hallway in the direction of the distressing sounds. I followed suit, trying to keep pace with him, but he had a significant advantage in speed, being a track team member back in school.


""Mark, hold on!"" I shouted, struggling to close the gap between us, but his agility outmatched mine, compounded by his initial head start.


""Someone is injured, Luke!"" he called out as he neared the corner where the cries echoed from. Determined to catch up, I pushed myself harder, yet I couldn't reach him in speed.


As I approached, my heart sank at the sight before me. Mark had reached the hallway's corner just as a figure pounced on him from the darkness. He staggered backward, pinned against the wall by the assailant. Drawing closer, I discerned the figure latched onto Mark was a man. His khaki pants drenched in the strange liquid I had encountered, bubbles forming amidst the dampness. His torn lab coat, covered with vomit, revealed the familiar purple worms from those on the deer we saw earlier.


With a desperate gaze, the man peered up at Mark through shattered eyeglasses, one eye infested with wriggling worms protruding from his pupil, waving left and right trying to reach out to Mark.


""Please..."" the stranger pleaded with Mark, who attempted to pull away from his grip. ""We were mistaken. It cannot die. It refuses to let us die"" His voice was chilling, a cacophony of two distinct tones speaking simultaneously. One voice filled with anguish, the other eerily serene. With each word he spoke, more of those grotesque worms spilled out of his mouth and onto Mark's waist. Mark managed to deliver a knee to the man's chest, dislodging his grip, before bolting back in the direction we had come from, grasping my arm in the process.



""GO!"" Mark bellowed, his voice cutting through the air like a knife. Without hesitation, I pivoted on my heels and sprinted after him, my heart pounding in my chest. Behind us, the man's desperate gasps and moans echoed down the corridor. I glanced back  to see the man on his knees, retching up a grotesque mass of worms onto the floor. Tears streamed down his face as he whispered apologies into the darkness, his voice raw with desperation, and those same dual voices.


 There was no time for sympathy as I turned my attention back to Mark, my muscles straining as I pushed myself to keep pace. Just as I thought we might escape, a door swung open with a deafening crash, slamming into my face with brutal force. Agony exploded through my skull as I stumbled backwards, and crashed to the ground just as everything around me went dark. 


As my eyes fluttered open, I was met with a wave of excruciating pain that threatened to consume me. My head pounded relentlessly, my ears rang with a deafening sound. Blood dripped down my face, mingling with my tears as I lay on my back, disoriented and lost.


The surrounding chaos blurred into indiscernible shapes and shadows, but the agonizing cries of wounded animals echoed through the darkness. Staring at the ceiling I could tell I was no longer in the hallway, but in a different room. With a heavy groan, I mustered all of my strength to roll onto my side, only to discover my cell phone lying next to me, its flashlight casting a glow.


Barely able to lift myself to my knees, I grasped the phone and brought it closer to my face. Through the haze, I saw a message displayed on the screen - a cryptic warning was left in the body of a text from myself with no recipient.


 ""Sorry about knocking you out, ""but there's no time. It's loose, and they're coming. Find the key in your pocket, take a left and head for the stairs. I'm already gone, you won't find me. Tell them what you saw.""


As the gravity of the situation sunk in, I realized that I needed to hurry. I groaned more as I pulled myself to my feet. Shining my phone ahead of me to get an understanding of where I was. In front of me was a large metal table, littered with broken vials and scattered papers covered in some kind of chemical. To the left of the table were large kennels stacked on top of each other, I walked over to them I was startled to see the animals that were inside. In one was a brown falcon, laying on its side and flailing its wing and legs, those hairy purple worms were covering its body, digging in and back out of holes covering its body, it's flailing wing had several of them nestled in between its feathers, some of them were flying off with every flap. 


In another kennel, was a small bulldog, dripping out of the mouth with worms, it lunged towards the door of the kennel barking at me trying to break free. Another kennel had another baby deer that was constantly screaming, both its eyes were gone and in its place were just mounds of wriggling, purple hairy worms. I stepped backwards away from the horrible site backing in to the table, my hand bracing on one of the wet pieces of paper on the table. I moved my light over it and could make some of it out, but the chemical poured over it made it difficult to read. 


* The study of (illegible) infestations has taken a terrifying turn as we observe the takeover of hosts by these new entities that grant them incredible strength, dexterity, and an unyielding resistance to conventional forms of (illegible). As the impending threat of human testing looms, ethical concerns abound as we witness the monstrous transformation of subjects into seemingly unkillable beings.


Methods: Subjects were exposed to parasitic infestation through controlled ingestion of contaminated food sources. Observations were made over an extended period to assess the progression of the infestation and its effects on host physiology.


Results: The parasitic infestation led to a nightmarish transformation in hosts, as they exhibited unprecedented muscle growth, enhanced dexterity, and an alarming increase in cell growth that rendered them impervious to traditional methods of treatment. Subjects displayed a terrifying hostility towards researchers and demonstrated a chilling ability to survive lethal doses of eradication attempts.


Discussion: The findings of this study reveal a sinister power within the parasitic entities that take control of hosts, granting them superhuman (illegible) and an unnerving resilience to harm. The ethical implications of continuing such experiments on human subjects are deeply troubling, as the potential consequences of unleashing these monstrous capabilities are beyond comprehension.


Conclusion: The parasitic infestation has unleashed a (illegible) within our research facility, as hosts are transformed into terrifying beings with incomprehensible strength, dexterity, and invulnerability. The looming specter of human testing raises grave concerns about the ethical boundaries we are willing to cross in the pursuit of scientific knowledge. As a researcher haunted by the horrors I have witnessed, I fear the horrors that may be unleashed if we continue down this treacherous path.*


I dropped the soggy paper back down on the table, having an inclination that whoever had written this report may be the person who dragged me into this room. I started towards the open doorway of the room, even more eager than before to leave. I stood in the hallway and recognized the staircase leading up the phone message must have been referring to 50 or so yards to my left, but a wet growling noise to my right caught my attention. Turning around, my heart froze at the sight of a large, humanoid creature clinging to the side of the wall on all fours. 


The purple skinned humanoid creature loomed before me, its labcoat and khakis in shreds and tatters. Its broken frame eyeglasses were askew on its large, yellow, predatory eyes that seemed to pierce through my very soul with a malevolent glow. Its muscular arms and legs were elongated and sinewy, with patches of dark hairs erupting from its sickly violet skin. The creature's bald head was adorned with a writhing mass of long, purple, worm-like tendrils that cascaded down its spine, wriggling and squirming in a grotesque display.


And from its twisted, contorted mouth hung the gruesome visage of my friend Mark's decapitated head, blood still oozing from the severed neck, the lifeless eyes staring blankly ahead. The creature stood there in eerie silence, a nightmarish amalgamation of horror and desolation, its presence sending chills down my spine as I struggled to comprehend the unimaginable sight before me. It opened its mouth and let out another wet growl, dropping Mark's head to the ground in the process. I was no longer frozen in place, it seemed as if my body moved on its own as I turned around and began racing for the staircase.


 I could hear the creature behind me running along the walls in hot pursuit of me. Every fiber of my body screamed in pain as I struggled to run across the concrete ground, hearing the beast pounce from wall to wall in its attempt to catch me, bellowing out an unearthly scream in its frustration. 


My legs seemed to find new strength while I ran up the cold staircase, and I propelled my whole body up into the double door covering that was at the very end of the staircase. Standing once again in the woods of Mount Alto, I looked around for something to keep the doors closed and quickly found a heavy tree branch just laying a few feet away from me. Hurriedly I grabbed it and dragged it back to the doorway and wedged it under the handle of the doors just as the creature threw itself into them causing the doors to budge slightly and the branch crack a little. 


I turned away and started running away along the creek bed, seeing the familiar hill Mark parked on just up ahead. My lungs felt like they were about to explode from the amount I was exerting myself as I passed the metal covering Mark and I used to enter the underground lab, but I couldn't slow down, not even as I passed the fawn we saw earlier, trying to push itself up on its remaining two legs despite not having a lower body or head. 


I fell to my hands and knees hearing the roar of the creature in the distance as I climbed the hill without falling standing up, and throwing myself in to Mark's truck once I made it to the top. I cussed as my nervous hands struggled to turn the key in the ignition, but settled myself once I heard the truck pur to life. As quickly as I could I made a sharp U-turn and began speeding off back to town on the bumpy dirt road that got us here. Along the way, I could hear helicopters above tearing through the sky, but I felt comfortable they couldn't see the truck through the canopy of trees. 


That was three days ago. Despite seeing several strange armored jeeps heading in the direction of Mount Alto, and occasionally seeing helicopters flying overhead in town, there has been complete media silence. I haven't been able to sleep, and I'm afraid of leaving my home. I don't know what was going on in that bunker, but whatever they were working on, is out now.

Here’s some back story, I recently became a mom after having a miscarriage a couple years ago, for my first Mother’s Day I planned an event that didn’t go through so, I decided to cancel the event. Here’s where I was an asshole, his cousin 30f confirmed to come and when I cancelled I forgot to cancel with her. In the midst of canceling with people one of my friends said a couple of us (her two friends and two of my friends) could do a quick brunch, so I forgot to cancel. Not to give an excuse but I was just about 10 weeks postpartum, and I was making some dipped strawberry arrangements for extra cash so I never let her know about the event. 

Later that day after several drinks, my boyfriend told me that she was very upset. In my drunken state I apologized, the next day I apologized once more and offered to make it up. No response. About a month goes by we get invited to his aunts house for her birthday bbq, I didn’t go due to going through a a hard week due to my postpartum; come to find out my bf’s ex girlfriend was invited by the cousin. I let that go and did not say anything. Still for her birthday I reached out and asked if we could go out for coffee or something so both our babies could see each other, no response. A couple of weeks later after I removed myself from her social media(I only followed her on instagram) she reached out to my bf telling him I was a weirdo, so I reached out and told her that was not ok with me, she replied once and then didn’t reply again. Every time her and my boyfriend get into an argument she talks badly about us and our family and I always bite my tongue. 

Two months go by, I don’t bother her at this point i’m living my life and she publicly starts to drag my name through the mud, spreading rumors about us and talking really nastily more specifically me. She crossed a line and I literally had it. But I did not want to feed into it, so I told my boyfriend that I will not be attending any family events where she would be and I also didn’t want to go to his moms house (his bothers bm still lives with them and used to talked badly about me with his cousin.) I think I would’ve understood her anger towards me if I was a vile or malicious person but I’m really not, I haven’t been super close to his maternal side because I’m quiet and just tend to keep to myself. My boyfriend is telling me that i’m punishing his mom, but I feel like removing myself from his maternal part of the family is protecting my peace and our baby’s peace.

It's really just Saga's sections that suffer. I'm wondering if anybody knows a fix or at least a way to reduce it. I searched around on reddit and a couple other forums, but most of those threads are from about a year ago, and none of the suggestions have helped so far.

I left the Airbnb clean and the host wrote a review saying nice things. I wrote a review that was mostly positive but mentioned the hair in the shower, I didn't mention the toilet paper because I didn't want to put others off but I wanted the hosts to take on some feedback about the cleanliness. 

After my review was posted I got a message that Airbnb removed her review about me because the host requested it. 

This is a petty move and totally unfair. It reminds me of the episode of Black Mirror ""Nosedive"" where the main character is drinking awful coffee and is scared of leaving honest feedback in fear of her social score dropping in response. 

I worry about leaving honest feedback on Airbnb and sites like Uber because of responses like this but how are businesses meant to improve without honest feedback? I understand the right of hosts to give feedback about customers in case they're noisy or they trash the place but it seems like some hosts abuse the system by using it as revenge against less than perfect reviews.

1g9xh0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNOLA/comments/1g9xh0b/trip_report_10151019_solo_traveler_mainly/,Trip Report (10/15-10/19): Solo traveler mainly traveling for convention,"I was attending SmileCon for work. My goal was to eat as much New Orleans food as possible. I prepared by browsing this subreddit, reviewing what Anthony Bourdain liked, and asking my coworker who was from New Orleans.

**Cat tax:** I hadn’t even been in New Orleans an hour when [this handsome stranger](https://imgur.com/a/rRLgCyF) welcomed me. S+ hospitality. Though it might’ve been because I’d just had fried shrimp and it wanted some.

**Stay:** City House Hostel. First time I ever stayed in a hostel, picked the cheapest one that had decent reviews. The people who work there are great, the events they plan are fun, and the kitchen is spacious and well stocked. The front door smells like pee, the dorm rooms have no windows which fucks up your sleep cycle, and you provide your own lock for the lockers. About what I expected save the windows, and that’s on me for not paying attention.

**Transit:** The app for the bus system works great. Bummer that they only show up every 30 minutes, and often I’d just walk because it was faster. Walking was comfortable because of the weather, how flat the city is, and how pretty the houses are.

**Food** (chronological order)

- Domilise’s: Had the off-the-menu po-boy (fried shrimp, Swiss cheese, beef gravy). I was licking my fingers by the end
- Hansen’s Sno-Bliz: After walking 15k steps up and down Magazine St, the Satsuma sno ball hits hard.
- Brother’s Food Mart: Best value for money meal I had. First time I heard the New Orleans accent. Shout out to the lady who gave me an extra piece.
- Café du Monde: I wanted to see if chicory would make me like coffee. Not quite. Loved the beignets. For $3.50, can’t complain.
- J’s Seafood Dock: Three grilled oysters still sizzling when they brought them out. Delish.
- Napoleon House: How nice of them to have a non-alcoholic version of their signature drink. Had the warm muffuletta with a side of jambalaya and red beans. Good meal in a great location.
- New Orleans School of Cooking: They took care of the boring parts of prep (cutting up the vegetables and chicken) and just let you get to the fun. A meal of gumbo and red fish amandine over pecan rice tasted even better when I knew I had a part in it, and getting to set something on fire for the bananas foster was the perfect finale
- Turkey and the Wolf: First time I ordered more than I could eat because I never knew when I’d be coming back. Bologna sandwich, collard greens sandwich, and pot pie. Each bite is straight to childhood, but not leftover friendly. Still worth it.
- Molly’s Rise and Shine: I wondered how they’d make roasted carrot yogurt work, and afterwards I wanted the recipe. Had the hashbrown with salmon roe topping so I’d have something hot and salty to balance out the cold and sweet.
- Cochon: Second time I ordered more than I could eat. Finally got the hype about boudin balls, and then ordered the ham hock because Bourdain and because I didn’t learn my lesson after Turkey and the Wolf. I had two bites of ham left before I called it quits.
- Muriel’s: Turtle soup and the dark chocolate tart. It was good, but I definitely paid more for the location than the food.
- Verti Marte: The spicy muffuletta made me weep but it was the perfect last two meals for my trip, dinner the night before and breakfast the morning of my flight.

**Sights** (chronological order)

- Bourbon St in the morning: I was warned to stay the hell off of Bourbon St, but it was an interesting walk on my way to Café du Monde. It’s like being the first one to wake up after a sleepover when you stayed up until 3AM playing Never Have I Ever.
- Pharmacy Museum: The cocaine for toothaches I already knew about; it was learning about lead tipped baby bottles (the sweet taste encourages them to drink!) that really punched my gut. I spent a lot more time here than I thought I would. I had to learn every little thing.
- Preservation All-Stars: The intimacy of the environment plus the music, from people who loved what they were doing and loved each other, made me silently cry.
- New Orleans Film Festival: Went to a screening of the Jackie Shane movie. Loved the movie. It was a little delayed because they were having trouble syncing the audio description, and they made it up to us with free popcorn (which I couldn’t eat because I have braces but it’s the thought that counts).
- Storyville Museum: I used to regularly read Maggie McNeill’s blog and her writing was one of the first things that made me want to re-visit New Orleans. Since the museum had opened just eight weeks ago, I was glad that the timing of my trip worked out. Off to a good start, I hope it sticks around.
- Halloween Parade: I’ve never been to Mardi Gras, but throwing candy seems so much better. Shout out to the 77 year old man dressed as Beetlejuice who kept drawing attention so he could get as much candy and Zapp’s chips for the nearby kids as possible.


**Shopping:** I like to visit places that sell used clothing and books, just in case I find something good.

- All of the used book stores I visited either in the French Quarter or near Magazine St were solid, and it’s how I found out about the Storyville Museum. For new books, **Octavia Books** is so good even the bathrooms are nice.
- Of the clothing places I went to, **Swap** stood out for having more designer pieces, **Century Girl** for dedication to both the luxury and aesthetic (and prices to match that dedication), and **United Apparel Liquidators** for being the only place that had something I wanted to try on (sadly, it was too big). Most places had a lot of stuff for Halloween out, which crowded out what I was interested in.
- Nothing like eating the eye candy at the museum-with-price-tags that is **M.S. Rau**. The wealthy really do live different. I did overhear “everything in this case is 50% off”, which makes me wonder at the markup.
- **The French Market** is definitely for tourists and I saw the same dress at three different stalls, though still a good walk. I had a lot more fun at the **Frenchmen Art Bazaar** where I talked to one of the sellers about anime. I also stumbled upon the **Disco Warehouse**, like a smaller version of the bazaar, when en route to the Halloween Parade.

**Goodbye with a “Hello!”** I met [Iko](https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/in-new-orleans-french-quarter-a-cockatoo-named-iko-holds-court/article_9f516330-d58d-502a-bb89-f391c92ec27a.html) completely by chance on my way back from the parade, and got to see some neighbors say hello to her, too. Fitting that my trip began with a cat and ended with a bird.

**For Next Time**

- WWII Museum: I was told this needed a full day and there was other stuff I wanted to focus on.
- Kermit Ruffins: The times he was performing I was very, very tired.
- Alligator tour: I thought it’d be too cold, but other people at the hostel said they saw plenty.
- Downriver: I would’ve loved to eat brunch Elizabeth’s, toured Studio Be, and attended a Thursday night at Vaughan’s
- Yakamein: Ms. Linda Green was at Funk Fest, which I didn’t have tickets to.
- Crawfish: Out of season when I visited.
- Fancier restaurants: If ever I can convince my husband to make a trip here with me, I’d like to go to places like Brigsten’s. With him around we can order more dishes!
- In general, more stuff outside of the French Quarter and the area of Uptown I went to by necessity of needing to stay close to the convention center.
- Maybe I’ll visit around Mardi Gras just to do it once then never again.

**TL;DR:** I had a wonderful time doing everything I wanted and then some. I prepared but left myself room for surprise, and I hope I can return sooner than 20 years from now. Also I hope Rouses stays private and never gets eaten by Albertsons or Kroger. I don’t drink but seeing 99 cent liquor bottles was delightful.",6,1729643157.0,AskNOLA,0,1.0,False

An IT professional who claimed tax deductions for working 365 days a year, home-office cleaning by his wife and driving his BMW almost exclusively for work has lost in the Administrative Review Tribunal. 

Alexander Shugai sought to claim deductions for more than $30,000 in work-related expenses for the tax year ending June 30, 2022, including $11,420 he said he paid his wife for cleaning and document management. “While any cleaning services provided by the applicant’s spouse would have been of some value to him, such services are inherently of a private and domestic nature,” the tribunal found. A bid to claim-home office cleaning services was unsuccessful.   

With 10 million Australians claiming more than $28 billion in work-related expenses last year – an average of $2739 each – the Australian Tax Office encounters many bogus returns. But this case was “clearly fairly outrageous”, said Mark Chapman, the director of tax communications with H&R Block. “You must be able to appropriately split any expenses which are partly work related and partly private,” he said. “And don’t make stuff up.” 

Mr Shugai, who lived in Melbourne with his wife, children and father, also tried to deduct 100 per cent of $7000 in repairs to the downstairs part of the family home he used as an office. He claimed large portions of household power and water bills as home office expenses, along with 100 per of the family’s internet bill and half the cost of two council bins, despite the fact that his role as a technical architect was “overwhelmingly of an electronic nature”. 

Mr Shugai lodged a claim for $5327 in motor vehicle expenses, 97.5 per cent of which he said was attributable to business activity. In a decision statement this month affirming the Tax Office’s earlier decision to disallow the expenses, tribunal member Robert Cameron did not hide his incredulity. Although Mr Shugai was “clearly an educated, intelligent and articulate man”, his evidence was at times “given with a propensity towards exaggeration, embellishment and/or implausibility”, Mr Cameron said. This was evidenced by a false claim that his approach to deducting expenses had been approved by former federal government minister Alan Tudge. “The purpose of such evidence appeared to the tribunal to be a misguided effort at contending that his claims for deductions had some ministerial imprimatur,” Mr Cameron said. “This evidence was fanciful. No documentary corroboration of such evidence was provided by the applicant. It defies belief.”

 Mr Shugai was employed by Ice Data Services International Australia. But he claimed expenses associated with being on call for the New York office 365 days a year from 6am until 11pm. “If his employer was in New York, presumably paying him a salary, no foreign source income or tax paid on any foreign source income was disclosed in such income tax return as one would have expected,” the AAT’s decision said. Nor was there evidence Mr Shugai was required to work anything more than regular office hours, save for some occasional overtime. 

Mr Shugai contended that 31 per cent of the floor area of the family’s two-storey home was given over to his income earning activities. But the tribunal was puzzled by his haphazard apportionment. “The amounts claimed range from 25 per cent for rates due to Yarra Valley Water (and council rates) and 100 per cent for repairs and cleaning the office. “It is not apparent to the tribunal how these individual percentages were arrived at.” During cross-examination, Mr Shugai was asked about his claim of 50 per cent of the cost of council bins. “He boldly stated that half of the bins were for business use,” the decision said. “Quite understandably, it was suggested to him that all of his work was done electronically. His response was that there were, ‘still scraps of paper’. “To suggest that the applicant from his business activities, which clearly were overwhelmingly of an electronic nature, would generate the same waste as a household of five people, once again smacks of total unreality. “It seems unlikely that the applicant’s business activities would use 25 per cent of the total water consumption in a household occupied by five people with a swimming pool and a private garden.” 

The ATO says it questioned about 500,000 income tax returns for work-related expenses in FY23 and around 570,000 in FY24. Mr Chapman said claimants must be able to demonstrate a clear link between an expense and the source of his or her income, as well as being able to substantiate expenses with receipts or invoices. “An amount is only deductible to the extent to which it is incurred in gaining or producing assessable income,” he said. ""[Also] there was clearly a problem with the inappropriate apportionment of the household bills that this taxpayer claimed that related to his home office."" The sum Mr Shugai claimed for plant and equipment was $10,348, of which the ATO allowed permissible decisions of $4324.59 following an audit. But Mr Shugai challenged the disallowance of the remaining $6024.38. “What emerges from an examination of such receipts is that on their face they are for goods or services of a private or domestic nature,” the decision said. “For instance, there was a music book, toilet paper, medications, private personal health insurance, milk, tea, coffee, bottled mineral water, sugar and insect spray. “There was even a claim for fees incurred in VCAT [the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal]. He has made a claim for a deduction of 100 per cent of this expenditure incurred on the grounds that they were solely work related. “There was also a claim for expenditure at Coles for Band-Aids. In cross-examination, with respect to this claim, the applicant sought to justify it because when he carried out his own computer repairs, he cut himself. “When questioned about whether he used the Band-Aids for personal use his response was that personal-use items were kept upstairs separate from those allocated to his workplace.”",2,1729643131.0,aussie,1,1.0,False

1g9xfw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g9xfw8/needed_to_talk_about_this_somewhere/,Needed to talk about this somewhere,"I’ve only ever lurked on Reddit but I just really wanted to get this off my chest. 

My mother-in-law passed away a month ago. It was a very sudden thing that has left all of us reeling and heartbroken. She was truly the kindest and warmest woman that I’ve ever met and the best MIL that I’ve could’ve ever asked for. 

I’m feeling extra heartbroken because me and my husband finally decided the bite the bullet over the weekend to go to her house and start trying to sort through some of her extra things that weren’t already accounted for and distributed. (ex: her jewerly, fine china, etc.) 

Important context for this story: My MIL was a very talented quilter. She won a few ribbons for her quilts and there were several church fuctions where a prize for the cake-walk would be one of her quilts. You had to be careful if you sat on her couch for the fear of a pin getting you where the sun doesn’t shine. 

She made baby quilts for all of my nieces and nephews (even the ones on my side of the family. not just her grandchildren.) She made quilted coasters as wedding favors, as gifts for holidays and birthdays and anniversaries. She made quilts just because she wanted to make them. She donated them to homeless shelters, foster care, disaster zones, etc.  For years my go-to birthday gifts for her were a interesting mug from any old thriftstore and a giftcard to the local crafts shop. 

Other important context for this story: Me and my husband have never been able to have children. I had six miscarriages before I had a ectopic pregnancy that led to a complete hysterectomy. She was with us the entire time in the hospital and even helped my husband to take care of me afterwards as my own family lived hundreds of miles from us. I don’t think I would have survived those dark days without her endless support. 

We ended up adopting our three wonderful children. (Whom my MIL also made quilts for and always treated with every ounce of love and warmth that she gave to all of her grandchildren.) 

While we were going through her things in the attic we found a old trunk that had me and my husbands name on it. Inside were baby blankets. A couple dozens of them. All beautiful and neatly folded. One of them even had an embroidered name on it.  

She’d made them for our angel children and never said a word about them to us. 

It just inspired so many emotions in me. I had to go and sit in the car for a while and just weep. 

I don’t really have a good way to end this except that I just miss her so much. She’d be scolding me now for feeling ashamed at having cried so much. “Now, Lady, tears are perfectly natural. Ain’t met a soul yet that didn’t cry at least once. You just feel them and then let them pass.”

God but I don’t know what I’ll do without you Cici. I love you and I miss you and I wish that we could've had one last cup of coffee together. ",4,1729643070.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False
1g9xftu,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1g9xftu/le_meridien_madison_washington_dc_trip_report/,Le Meridien Madison Washington DC trip report,"Recently spent 2 nights at the Le Meridien Madison hotel in DC.  The hotel is 15 floors.  Nice lobby, efficient front desk/check in, friendly staff.  Burned two NUA's and got upgraded to a junior suite in a corner room.  It was a nice room, not the nicest I have been in, but certainly not the worst or smallest.  Really the only complaint with the room was a tub instead of a walk in shower.  Shower had good pressure and was hot enough.  One thing of note, was there was no coffee maker in the room.  There was a well stocked but pricey mini bar in the room.

Lobby was decent size, bar was nice.  They gave me two $18 drink vouchers on check in, when they heard we were in town for my gf's birthday.  It was very kind of them, and I was happily surprised.  It was enough to cover two cocktails, one each.  I think the bartender was having a rough day, as she was actually rather not nice...happens to the best of us I suppose.  

Breakfast both days I used the concierge lounge. The lounge was basic but got the job done, breakfast was scrambled eggs and sausage both days, with an assortment of fruit and pastry.  Coffee in the lounge was very good.   The paid breakfast in the restaurant looked to be about $30 per person for the buffet and was a bit more expansive in selection. I did not eat another meal in the hotel...who wants hotel food when there are so many options in DC.  Had I been there for a 3rd breakfast, I would probably have ventured out for something instead of the lounge.

Valet parking is $78 a night.  Expensive.  I used spot hero and found a garage about a 5 minute  walk away in the Washington Post building, that cost me $22 for 48 hours, w/ no in/out which was fine.  The location of the hotel is walking distance to the red metro line in one direction, and to the blue/silver/yellow (or orange I cant remember) lines in the other direction.  Also it was a very  reasonable walking distance to all the monuments and such.  Over all the hotel was clean, well kept, and nice.   I rate it a 8 out of 10, loosing a bit of points for no coffee maker in the room, the shower being a tub, and the lack of hot food for the lounge.  I would stay there again with out a second thought.",3,1729643064.0,marriott,0,1.0,False

She also tailors each resume to the different job position, writes a different cover letter every time - I tell her not to as for me I only had one resume no cover letter and shotgun applied - but she says her field is different so I don't really know better than her. She applies to everywhere too, not just the big 4, and not just summer positions, and yet she has not been successful yet and getting an internship. IMO she has a robust resume for someone without the first internship yet too, while she didn't get internships, she has been doing a part-time workstudy position as an accountant, she volunteers at tax clinics to get experience, and she is active and holds leadership positions in accounting related university clubs as well for many years. Nobody is giving her a chance. She doesn't have an amazing top gpa, but it is not bad and still over cumulative 3.5/4.0. I am not really in her field so I can't give her advice, but I did look at her resume and it looks strong - she quantifies her impact/experience with metrics and numbers, uses strong verbs, concise with bullet points and organized neatly - all the resume workshops say it's a good resume. I made sure it was scannable by AI too. She is the hardest working person I know, and for some reason she is not getting rewarded for her efforts. 

Even more perplexingly her other peers are getting internships, so it can't really be blamed on the economy. Some of her peers even act disrespectfully to her now as she doesn't have an internship yet. It is really taking a toll on her. She used to be so bright and optimistic the first year I met her but it is heartbreaking to see her crumble and nothing I can do for her besides to stay beside her.

1g9xbzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoberCurious/comments/1g9xbzj/for_those_of_you_with_anxiety/,For those of you with anxiety….,"Hi all, I’ve been realizing lately that I need to cut back on my drinking. Daily wine in the evenings has become my ritual and way to unwind from a long day with two small children, running a business with my husband, cooking, cleaning….ya know…all the things. It wasn’t until two months ago that all of a sudden, out of nowhere while I was playing with my daughter sipping my morning coffee, I was slapped in the face by a mega panic attack. Like thought I was going to pass out, puke, die all at once. It hasn’t stopped since that day, only gotten worse.

Some background, I’ve always low key struggled with anxiety but never had I ever been crippled by it DAILY. Waking me up at night with racing heart and inability to go back to sleep, constant talking myself off the anxiety ledge multiple times a day, and then drinking in the evening to make it all just go away. And while it works in the moment, as we all know that it’s only temporary. Here I am, on the hamster wheel. 

I’ve always been able to drink wine and never had this bad of an issue with anxiety so I’m like where is this coming from? I had just assumed that since I have been spread thin and very stressed for months prior that my body finally reached its limit hence the onset of the anxiety. Well, as the anxiety increases the daily want for the liquid escape becomes more prevalent. I’m just now realizing after reading some that this is likely alcohol induced and I need to make a change….cut back at the very least. 

My question: those who have struggled with anxiety, how long did it take for you to feel less anxious after stopping drinking? Was it immediate? Did it take time? ",2,1729642755.0,SoberCurious,1,1.0,False

“Alright, Vell Harlan, let’s do a quick recap of your situation,” Kim said.

“We really don’t have to,” Vell sighed.  Kim did it anyway.

“You devoted all of yesterday to an endeavor which you are not good at, don’t enjoy, aren’t getting paid for, and is actively detrimental to your academic career,” Kim said.  “You got so overwhelmed by this newfound responsibility you forgot your studies, had to spend most of your evening bothering your classmates and the rest of it desperately trying to catch up on your studies, which caused you to lose sleep.  So now you’re up for round two, except sleep-deprived this time?”

“It still has to get done,” Vell said.  “And hey, this time I have people already making spare notes for me, so I don’t have to go through that whole thing again!”

“Oh, good, one problem among several dozen resolved,” Samson said.  “It’s time to face the music, Vell, this is whole teaching thing is a whomper.”

“Scientifically speaking, it has whomped,” Alex said.  “Freddy and I ran the calculations.”

“You can’t calculate for that,” Vell said.

“Yes you can,” Alex said.  “I have the math right here.”

She held up a complex sheet of facts and figures, which Vell ignored.  Hawke grabbed it to take a closer look.

“Hmm, carry the two, account for time...add in neglecting Skye,” Hawke mumbled.  “Oh geez, this is actually worse than I thought.  You got to quit, Vell.”

“I am not quitting,” Vell said.  “Not while there’s no replacement.”

Though he had spent a sleepless night in search of a substitute, Dean Lichman had not yet found a suitable replacement for Professor Nguyen.  Since he was not quite so close to Vell to be aware of all the difficulties he was facing in his new role, the Dean had no qualms about allowing Vell to continue.  Those who were much closer had significantly more qualms.  Almost all possible qualms, in fact.

“I don’t know where this stubbornness is coming from, Vell,” Kim said.  “But I hope you get over it soon, for your sake.”

“Sorry I’m trying to help people,” Vell grunted.  “Maybe you’re right, I should just tell several hundred students to go fuck themselves because I’m more important, apparently.”

“Ugh, you’re starting to sound like me,” Alex grunted.

“Look, I appreciate the concern, but I’m handling it,” Vell said.  “Yeah, I got a little behind yesterday, but I also had to carve and combine an entire nine-rune sequence for that Shamaxus guy.”

“Nine?”

“Yeah,” Vell said.  “I know they were only a few lines each, but that’s still a lot of work.”

“I know, but Vell, I was in charge of hauling the reliquary back to the archaeology lab,” Alex said.  “There were definitely only eight runes on that thing.”

All eyes turned to Vell, and he shook them off.

“That can’t be right, if I’d broken the sequence the whole thing never would’ve worked, the Runelord would’ve escaped by now,” Vell said.  Then his forehead wrinkled.  “Unless I missed the ‘charge’ rune, that’d leave the whole sequence with barely enough energy to last-”

In the distance, the archaeology lab blew up.  The conversation died down as the shockwave passed through the room and rattled the shelves of Professor Nguyen’s office.

“I was in a hurry, alright?”

\*\*\*

One time loop and a repaired rune sequence later, the Runelord had been imprisoned for a second, more permanent time, and Vell had gone right back to work as a professor.  Nothing Alex had been able to say to him had made any difference, so she stuck to watching from the sidelines as Vell marched into the dining hall, got something to eat, and marched right back out.  He didn’t even stop to sit down and relax.

“Is it really that bad?” Freddy asked.

“It’s worse, if anything,” Alex said.  Freddy didn’t even know about the Runelord or the explosions.  “Vell’s having a tough time with this.”

“It’s weird to think that after everything he’s been through, teaching is what gives him the most trouble,” Freddy said.

“He’d probably be doing a lot better if it weren’t for...you know,” Alex mumbled.  “Professor Nguyen.”

As much as the rigors of academic life were challenging Vell, the pressure and guilt were even worse.  He would be more willing to step back if he didn’t feel like he had to live up to Professor Nguyen’s legacy, at least, Alex was sure of that.

“I get it,” Freddy said.  “I didn’t really know Professor Nguyen that well, because she terrified me-”

Alex nodded in agreement.  She had met Nguyen only once, but the memory of that stare haunted her.

“-but it seemed like Vell really respected her.”

“Very much so,” Alex said.  “And I guess the feeling was mutual.  She wouldn’t have asked him to do this if she didn’t think he was capable.”

“I don’t think she really knew what she was asking, though.”

While Vell certainly had the knowledge required to be a teacher, he did not have the temperament, the resources, and most crucially, the time necessary to dedicate himself to it.  His life had been a clusterfuck in six different ways before all this had begun, and now it was a clusterfuck in at least seven.  Possibly more.

“I know.  I wish there was something I could do to help,” Alex said.  “I feel like shit, not being able to help Vell after all he’s-.”

Alex almost managed to take another bite of her lunch before some of her braincells sparked.  She froze with a piece of lettuce dangling right in front of her open mouth.

“Alex?  You look like you had an epiphany,” Freddy said.

“Because I did,” Alex said.  “I need to go.”

She abandoned her salad, gave Freddy a kiss on the cheek (an act which caused him to turn bright red), and then ran away.  She knew what she needed to do, but it would require some preparation.  This sort of thing didn’t come naturally to her.

\*\*\*

“-And that mostly covers the Ikoshi Method,” Vell said.  He checked the time.  “And perfect timing, because we are about done.”

A few hands in the classroom went up.

“Sorry, I really don’t have time for questions,” Vell said.  “I’ll be here- I might be here tomorrow, though, so if we have time I can answer it then.”

Vell returned to Professor Nguyen’s office before he could get pestered any further.  He made it about halfway through packing up his papers before someone knocked on his door.

“I don’t really have office hours,” Vell said.  “But if you’re desperate, I guess-”

“Vell, it’s me,” Alex said.  Vell opened the door for her, and she reviewed some notecards in her hands as she stepped through.

“Alex, what’re you doing?”

“I’m not good at this kind of stuff, I want to make sure I’m doing it right,” Alex said.

“Alex, I swear to god, if you cast some kind of spell on me-”

Alex tucked the notecards away and threw her arms wide, and Vell got worried she really was going to cast a spell on him.  He flinched, but the green glow he was expecting never came.  Instead, Alex stepped forward and grabbed him in one of the most uncomfortable hugs of his life.

“I’m sorry about Professor Nguyen,” Alex mumbled.  Vell bit his tongue.

“There’s nothing to be sorry for.  She was-” Vell’s words caught in his throat.  “She made her choice.”

“She was ready to go, but you weren’t ready for her to leave,” Alex said.  “I’m sorry you couldn’t help her, Vell.  But what you’re doing isn’t going to change anything.’

“That isn’t- get off me,” Vell said.  He shook Alex off and went back to the desk to pack up his things.  “I’m not doing this because of- I mean, I am doing it for her, but she asked me to!  For the students.”

“You’re doing it for you, Vell,” Alex said.  “You want to pour yourself into this and make up for the fact you think you didn’t do enough.”

“Of course I didn’t do enough,” Vell snapped.  “If I’d done enough, Professor Nguyen would still be alive.”

Vell grabbed the last of his papers, slammed them into his bag, and then collapsed into the chair behind the desk.

“She came to save me when I got kidnapped,” Vell said.  “And I couldn’t even...”

He should’ve done more, said more, but instead Vell had backed down.  Accepted something he shouldn’t have accepted.  He felt like the biggest idiot on Earth.

“Professor Nguyen didn’t need to be saved, Vell.  She was ready.  She made her choice,” Alex said.  “You just need to honor it.”

“I am honoring it,” Vell said.  He gestured to the desk in front of him.  “This is me honoring it.”

“Vell.  Look at me.”

When Vell looked up to face Alex, she was holding a mirror right in front of him.  All he could see was his own face, with coarse stubble on his chin and dark circles under his eyes.  He had grabbed at or toyed with his hair out of stress enough that it was a tangled mess.

“Do you think that’s what honor looks like?”

“Honor is more of an internal quality, the fact I need a shower has nothing to do with it,” Vell said.  He shoved Alex’s mirror aside and stood up.  “And going after someone’s physical appearance is always kind of a dick move.”

“Sorry.  I’m just trying to make a point,” Alex said.  “This isn’t good for you.  And it’s not what Professor Nguyen would want.”

She stepped up and grabbed Vell by the shoulders.  He started to worry another terrible hug was coming, but Alex stopped there.

“You want to take care of her students.  Honor her legacy,” Alex said.  “I get that.  But you’re her student.  You’re her legacy.  You need to take care of yourself too.”

Vell could not manage to look her in the eye.

“I should’ve done more,” he mumbled.

“You did enough, Vell,” Alex assured him.  “You’ve done enough.  Give yourself a break.”

Alex leaned in and gave him another hug, much to Vell’s chagrin.  He tolerated it for ten seconds before realizing she was probably not going to let go on her.

“I hate to ruin the mood, Alex, but you really got to work on your hug technique,” Vell said.  She stepped back and balled her fists.

“Damn it,” she said.  She pulled the notecards back out and scanned them.  Now that he had a closer look, Vell could see they were all various diagrams of hugs.  “I worked so hard on that.  Was it the elbows?”

“Shoulders, actually.  Very pointy,” Vell said.  “Really need to lead with the chest.  Were all your preparations hug-related?”

“Well, yes, I kind of felt like I knew what to say,” Alex said.  “I’m terrible at hugging, though, haven’t done it very much.”

“You’ll learn.”

“So, terrible hugging aside...did anything I said help?”

“Ugh.  I don’t know, maybe?” Vell said.  “I need to sleep on it.  I need to sleep in general, frankly.”

“Well, somebody made sure the apocalypse happened early this morning,” Alex said.  “You should have plenty of time to rest.”

“Heh.  I still have to deal with catching up on notes, among other things,” Vell said.

“Then I’ll get out of your way,” Alex said.

“One more thing, though,” Vell said.

“Yeah?”

Vell held his arms out.

“You need some practice.”

“Okay, hugs.  I got it.  No shoulders,” Alex said, as she put her shoulders back.  “Lead with the chest.  Is that...isn’t that kind of weird, with my breasts?”

“It’s only weird if you make it weird.”

“Which I just did?”

“Which you just did,” Vell said.  He put his arms down and grabbed his bag.  “We’ll try some other time.  Good night, Alex.  And thanks.”

Alex stepped aside and let Vell exit the office.  He had a lot to think about.  Probably too much.

\*\*\*

A multicolored elephant stared down at Vell from a shelf when he woke up.  He had no idea what to do with the elephant, so for now it sat on a shelf in his room, adorning the same wall as Roxy’s guitar and Prickly the Cactus.  The inexplicable ornament glared down at him with a judgmental look in its mismatched eyes.

“I really wish I knew what was up with you.”

Right next to him, Skye stirred and checked the time.  She sighed as soon as she saw the clock.

“Vell,” she mumbled.  “Are you talking to the elephant at six AM?”

Vell delayed a moment, hoping Skye might go back to sleep and forget this had ever happened.  She didn’t.

“Yes.”

“You’re lucky you’re cute,” Skye said.  “And also that I’m up in half an hour anyway.”

The rigors of academia did not leave much time for sleeping in.  Skye was not feeling the year end squeeze quite as hard as Vell, but she still felt it.  She woke up, got dressed, and turned on the coffee machine.

“So, you still going to be playing professor today?”

Vell finished getting dressed, sat down at the table, and watched the coffee drip into the pot.

“Nah.”

“You should think- wait, really?”

“Yes, really,” Vell said.  “I think I got in over my head.”

Everything that Alex and the others had been trying to tell him finally made sense.  Vell was trying to fix something that he couldn’t fix, and overexerting himself in the process.  No one would want that, least of all Professor Nguyen.  Were she still alive, she would’ve given him a scolding lecture about it, even.

“Good,” Skye said.  She gave Vell a kiss on the cheek.  “I’ve never been so proud of you for giving up.”

“Don’t get used to it,” Vell said.  “I’m going to head out a little early anyway.  I owe Dean Lichman a heads up.”

“We’ll have to throw you a retirement party later.”

“I just got some of my spare time back, Skye, we’re not using it on parties,” Vell said.  He kissed her goodbye and then got ready to face the day.  He hoped Dean Lichman wouldn’t mind losing him as a teacher too much.  The Dean had enough going on without being down a professor right before test season -but that was not Vell’s problem.  Mostly.  He stopped thinking about it before he could talk himself back into teaching.  He had to look after himself too.

The door to Dean Lichman’s office was open, so Vell stepped inside.  Dean Lichman looked up from his computer with his usual pleasant smile.

“Mr. Harlan.  How is the teaching going?”

“Going to be honest, Dean, it sucks real bad.”

“Ah.”

“I came to tell you I’m calling it quits,” Vell said.  “I just can’t handle the extra responsibility right now.  I’m sorry if that-”

“Allow me to spare you the speech and a significant amount of guilt,” Dean Lichman interjected.  “The school board hired a substitute earlier this morning.  I’ve just finished off their paperwork.”

“Oh.”

That slightly defanged his climactic decision to quit, but Vell would at least be spared the guilt of leaving the classes unattended.

“I was going to go meet them in a moment, but since you’re here, would you mind accompanying me?” Dean Lichman asked.  “I’d ask you to hand over Professor Nguyen’s lesson plans, at the very least.  If you could help acclimate the new substitute, it would be appreciated, but I understand if you’re busy.”

“I’ve got time to talk,” Vell said.  Easing the transition would be simple, at least.

Dean Lichman finished his work and headed out towards the rune labs, and Vell followed.

“So who is the new sub?  Anyone notable?”

“I’m afraid I don’t track the academic community closely enough to say,”  Dean Lichman said.  “Their resume looked impressive enough, at least.  Is the name Adair Kristali familiar?”

“Not really,” Vell said.  It hadn’t popped up in any textbook or research paper he’d ever read, at least.  “Seems kind of-”

Four wrinkles appeared on Vell’s forehead as if from nowhere, and disappeared just as fast.  Vell took off running towards the lab, leaving Dean Lichman in the dust.  The name Adair Kristali didn’t mean anything on its own, but as an anagram, it meant something very, very bad.  Vell slammed the door to the classroom open and stepped through.  A piece of bone-white chalk scratched out a name written by a hand of blackened bone.

“Kraid.”

Alistair Kraid turned and aimed his trademark sinister smirk at Vell.

We want to stay safe and comfortable without venturing outside the airport. Are there any lounges you recommend that offer access to arriving passengers, especially with any debit or credit card benefits? What about comfortable seating areas or other facilities that could help us pass the time?

We’re also curious if there are any good places to grab a bite to eat or coffee during those early hours. Any tips or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!

I'm in finance and need to fly often, my exes cheated on me because I cannot commit time and my role kind of make me lack of the energy to maintain the rs.

Friends recommend Hinge and tantan latest app, tantan tribe to date. I realised tinder had the most scammers, hinge and coffee ppl are weird somehow because i have chat much, they ask me about the P&C details and tell me they are here for marriage and tantan/ tribe or not somehow give me better dates than the others.

My relatives ask until i have no valid ans for them.

Does anyone or can anyone recommend me platforms to date better?

My girlfriend and I are gearing up for a trip to beautiful Pondicherry, and we’ll be landing at Chennai Airport at 1 AM on a domestic flight. Since the first metro doesn’t leave until around 5 AM, we’d love some advice on how to make the most of our time at the airport.

We want to stay safe and comfortable without venturing outside the airport. Are there any lounges you recommend that offer access to arriving passengers, especially with any debit or credit card benefits? What about comfortable seating areas or other facilities that could help us pass the time?

We’re also curious if there are any good places to grab a bite to eat or coffee during those early hours. Any tips or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!

I once had a student who always seemed to mix up _""un po'""_ and _""poco""_ during our Italian lessons. It was like a dog chasing its tail! Eventually, they got the hang of it with a little practice and some laughs along the way.

**_Un po'_ and _poco_ Primer**

In Italian, **""a little""** can be translated as either _un po'_ or _poco_, but these words play different roles. Let’s unpack them with some everyday examples:

- I’d like **_un po'_** of sugar in my coffee.
- I slept **_poco_** last night.

**The tale of _poco_**

In Italian, _poco_ carries a certain weight. It’s like having too little time in a day! It can be a noun, adjective, or even an adverb, and grammatical gender comes into play:

- **Adjective use**: _Poche opzioni_ (“few options"") like your wardrobe on laundry day!
- **Pronoun use**: _Ne è rimasto poco_ (“There is little left”).

**_Un po'_ adventure**

_**Un po'**_, however, is the hero for those ""just right"" moments, like a Goldilocks of grammar. It's got a cheerier vibe:

- ***“Un po’ di cioccolato”***: (translates to: a little bit of candy is just what you need!)

Whether you go with _poco_ or _un po'_, knowing which to use can make your Italian chat more colorful. So, have you tangled with these two before, or are you feeling ahead of the game? Share your stories!",1,1729641627.0,thinkinitalian,0,1.0,False

We’re really interested in a property in Knaresborough after initially thinking we'd move to Harrogate as we absolutely love the town. There’s nothing on the market there right now, but we found a lovely place in Knaresborough. We’re trying to figure out if it would suit us.

We don’t know much about the town and live quite far away, so popping over for a visit isn’t that easy.

Safety is our top priority. I’m from a very safe small town in Europe, and I’ve had a tough time adjusting to the crime levels in the UK. My husband says Knaresborough is very statistically safe and slightly makes fun of me for questioning Knaresborough, but I’d still love to hear from other people who live or have lived there. Are there areas we should avoid, and why? For example, I’ve heard Stockwell Lane isn’t great, but I don’t know how it compares to bad areas in bigger cities? I am searching for perspective. Is the High Street safe and improving? I want to be able to walk around town daily without worrying about my little dog getting snatched.

We like that Knaresborough is quieter than Harrogate since we do want a smaller-town feel, but it seems a bit more run-down. That’s fine as long as it’s improving—we want to settle in a place that’s on the up, for stability and investment long term, since it’s not our forever home. Do you think Knaresborough fits that?

We’re not concerned about schools (planning to homeschool), and we’re not big on nightlife. We’re after a strong sense of community, safety, nature to walk our dogs... A few nice coffee shops and locally sourced food would be great, and we can always go to Harrogate for bigger outings.

Any insights would be amazing! This is a big move for us, and I’ve had some negative experiences living in the UK, so I hope I don’t sound too paranoid. It’s just really important for us to settle in a place where we feel safe and can build a happy, relaxed life. I’ve been here for five years since marrying my English husband, but it’s been hard to find a community I feel at home in. Now that we’re ready to start a family, feeling settled and secure is everything.

Short time follower, first time poster.
 
I just started my first composting project. To give some context: it’s all in a plastic bin, about 4’x2’x2’ with holes throughout the sides and lid for air circulation.
 
In the bin:
 
-Browns: Dead leaves and bits of rotting wood and bark found around the yard.
 
-Greens: Food scraps (coffee grounds, egg shells, pumpkins and other vegetable and fruit scraps) and lawn clippings.
 
-Dirt from some planters that were no longer growing anything.
 
 -3 pints of urine.
 
I’ve kept everything moderately damp and have turned the pile once or twice since I started it this past Saturday.
 
I have a crappy meat thermometer in there for now and temps won’t go above 80F during the day. I’m in the north east and it’s been mild temps so far throughout the fall. It was mid 70’s today so I can’t help but believe the temp in the bin is just a byproduct of the general temperatures. I noticed mold growing in the there for the first time today on some food scraps.
 
I’ve tried to follow all the suggestions and guidelines offered online but still can’t get this little pile to start to heat up. Any suggestions? Does it need more browns? More greens? I read that mold growth is ok, is that true?

# IMF Lowers Global Growth Forecast, Warns of Increasing Risks

The International Monetary Fund (IMF)—aka the global economy’s watchdog—is sounding the alarm on next year’s growth prospects. 

The IMF, which keeps tabs on the financial health of its 190 member countries, has cut its global growth forecast to 3.2% for 2025, slightly down from its July estimate.

# McDonald’s Quarter Pounder Tied to E. Coli Outbreak

McDonald’s Quarter Pounder has found itself in hot water after being linked to an E. coli outbreak, which has sickened 49 people across 10 states, leaving one person in Colorado dead. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) flagged slivered onions used in the burger as the likely culprit. McDonald’s wasted no time, pulling the Quarter Pounder from restaurants in the affected states to contain the outbreak. Talk about a PR nightmare.

**Onion Tears and Bigger Worries**  
It’s not just the onions making people cry. E. coli O157, the strain in question, can cause some nasty symptoms—think severe stomach cramps, and vomiting. Ten people have already been hospitalized, and a child developed a rare complication that can lead to kidney failure. 

The CDC is still investigating whether the beef patties or onions are the real issue, but McDonald's is already yanking both from its menu in certain states. Safety first, right?

**Déjà Vu for Fast Food?**  
If this sounds familiar, it’s because Chipotle dealt with a similar E. coli disaster in 2015 that tanked sales and kept customers away for years. McDonald’s is hoping to avoid that fate by taking “swift and decisive action,” according to Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald’s USA. 

He reassured customers that the Big Mac and other menu staples are still safe to chow down on—but for now, the Quarter Pounder is a no-go in several states, including Colorado, Kansas, and Utah.

**The Fallout**  
This outbreak couldn’t come at a worse time for McDonald’s, whose US business has already been struggling with inflation-weary customers and slowing sales. 

The company’s shares fell over 6% in after-hours trading as news of the outbreak spread. McDonald’s has built a reputation on its robust food safety practices, but as history has shown with other chains, foodborne illness outbreaks can be hard to shake off. 

McDonald’s better hope this stays a small fry problem, or it could have a serious mess on its hands.

# IMF Lowers Global Growth Forecast, Warns of Increasing Risks

The International Monetary Fund (IMF)—aka the global economy’s watchdog—is sounding the alarm on next year’s growth prospects. 

The IMF, which keeps tabs on the financial health of its 190 member countries, has cut its global growth forecast to 3.2% for 2025, slightly down from its July estimate. 

On the bright side, inflation is cooling, expected to fall to 4.3% from 5.8%. Central banks have managed to tame rising prices without triggering recessions. So, cheers to that...sort of.

IMF’s Chief Economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, didn’t sugarcoat it: the risks are piling up. With regional conflicts flaring and protectionism on the rise, global markets could take a hit—especially in commodities. 

And let’s not forget global debt, which is on track to hit a jaw-dropping $100 trillion by year-end, mostly thanks to big spenders like the US and China. T

**Eurozone Struggles, China Slows**  
The IMF downgraded the Eurozone’s outlook to 1.2%, mostly due to sluggish manufacturing in Germany and Italy. China didn’t fare much better—its growth forecast was slashed too, largely thanks to a shaky real estate market and low consumer confidence. 

Though China’s central bank rolled out some new measures, the IMF isn’t convinced they’ll do enough to turn the tide. On the flip side, the US is winning the growth race with an upgraded forecast of 2.8%, riding high on strong consumer spending.

**Inflation’s Almost Beat, But...**

* **Tesla** has also been riding a rollercoaster, battling a rocky global EV market and a CEO who’s been in the spotlight for all kinds of reasons. With an insanely high valuation, sluggish EV sales, and a CyberCab event that didn’t do much to reassure investors, tomorrow’s earnings report could be a crucial moment. Consensus: $0.61 EPS, $25.52 billion in revenue. ($TSLA)
* **IBM**, meanwhile, has been a much more stable investment, nearly doubling the S&P 500’s returns this year. AI excitement has fueled most of that growth, even though IBM isn’t growing as fast as its competitors. That said, IBM’s slow but steady gains in both sales and earnings make it a surprising dark horse in the AI race. Consensus: $2.22 EPS, $15.03 billion in revenue.

Some benefits and observations so far include:

- I now fall asleep usually within 10 mins or so
- Generally sleep 8 or more hours per night, whereas in a caffeinated state it would generally be closer to ~7 hrs.
- I no longer need to wake up once or twice in the middle of the night to use the restroom.
- I find that I'm able to have more relaxing and enjoyable conversations without feeling anxious.
- I don't constantly think about titrating my caffeine intake or wonder how I'm going to sleep at night due to caffeine.
- I can take deeper breaths and tap into a sense of calm when I need to.

Cons:
- I admittedly miss the taste of both coffee and tea.
- I sometimes feel less motivated at work. However, in those moments I am reminded I just need to find the right reasons to become more motivated and not rely on an external stimulant

This has been my N of 1 experience so far. I plan to continue following this path for the foreseeable future!

Is it possible to have myocarditis symptoms for only a day?

(Female, 24, 5ft 3in, 53kg). 

I had my winter booster of flu and covid the other day, and that night, and the following day I had an ache/squeezing sensation in left side of chest for a few hours. Since then a few shooting pains but nothing major. 

I have suffered from tachycardia for a few years and am on beta blockers but HR didn’t increase too much during the aching sensation. I also only had coffee and a banana all day so was definitely feeling poor.

I tried to ignore, and put it down to feeling bad after the boosters, being tired and hungry lol and it improved with some electrolytes and food and rest. Sometimes I am still short of breath but that could be the anxiety around it. Don’t want to go to doc since I am okay now, but I do worry re exercising making it worse. 

However I have gone down a rabbit hole re myocarditis and pericarditis and I am now concerned that this is what it was? Worried about exercising and drinking alcohol etc going forward just incase it was and I need to rest it…

**Chapter 302: Eye Opener**

The directions from my inaugural follower were simple.

Walk straight ahead.

And yet as I paused scarcely a few paces within a hollowed out cavern fit enough to host a whole family of dragons or a modest buffet at the Royal Villa, all I saw before me were obstacles. 

Not because they blocked my path. 

But rather because they impeded my eyes. 

Brass chandeliers so worn they absorbed the light of their candles. Carpets so faded that all I saw was the poorly chiselled stone underneath. And a string of tables clearly meant for a kitchen and not a dining hall.

Here, there, and everywhere, I saw less a hovel and more an emporium specialising in all the gifts intended as insults. 

The woollen tablecloth was particularly notable. To suggest that those at the table were so barbaric that a literal rug was needed to absorb the dribbling food stains was a taunt as fine as it was appropriate.

Drunken attendees shuffled around the tables laden with covered plates. 

Few bothered with embarrassment as hands darted beneath the metal cloches, drawing forth slivers of cold meats, shrivelled fruits and boiled disappointment. 

A lack of shame which echoed up and down this cavern. 

With wine glasses in hand, men and women boasted cheeks as scarlet as their robes. Yet despite the monotony of the colour, not every garment was equal.

I noted the differences with a glance. 

A hint of embroidery. A double-sewn cuff. A belt of leather. 

Small bits of decoration hoping to highlight one’s lack of importance from the next. 

Naturally, I knew none of them. Yet while I recognised no faces, I was all too familiar with the grating laughter. The boastful chatter. The glint of coins exchanging hands. 

And most of all, the stench of ambition drawn from a well all here hoped to climb from–mostly upon the heads of each other.

I gasped at once.

These … These were not ordinary hoodlums.

They were *nobility*.

There could be no mistake. Whether it was my own or those halfway across the continent, all nobility wore a smile excavated from the same barrel of tar. 

This … This was more than a simple dragon conspiracy.

I’d stumbled upon something with implications so far beyond what I should involve myself in that I could see the ocean levels rising from the tears of my diplomats! 

A plot beyond the schemes of the dispossessed, but this land’s aristocracy! 

And that … that was *wonderful*.

Why … here I thought I’d need to contend with an adversary with a minimum of guile! Yet anyone who made an error so grave as to entrust opening a peanut shell to nobility meant my presence was utterly surplus! 

Even without me, they were destined to sabotage themselves!

“Oho … ohohoho! C-Coppelia! Do you see what I see?!”

Beside me, my loyal handmaiden looked up from a large buffet plate she’d requisitioned in the past five seconds. A few of those present wrinkled their noses at her lack of discretion. 

I beamed with pride.

My, barely a day upon her return and she was already ruffling the feathers of her land’s nobility! I was an excellent tutor!

“Mmh?” Coppelia quickened the pace of her chewing, then loudly swallowed. A tut was directed her way. I was almost moved to tears. “What do you see? Because if it’s seasoning, you need to tell me where.”

I eyed the spread of … *things* gathered on her plate.

Whether they used to be alive or were currently wishing for their end, I had no idea. And given the way Coppelia was now ignoring her food, neither did she.

I shuddered.

“My apologies, I see no seasoning. But I see something even better. Your land’s nobility.”

Coppelia blinked.

Then, she gazed at the gathered assembly of miscreants.

“Eeehh … I dunno … I’m with the goblins on this one.”

“Whatever you’re thinking is not what I’m suggesting. No, what I’m saying is that you may rest at ease. The fears you hold regarding the wellbeing of your dragon will not come to pass. After all, anything involving even a smidgeon of the gentry is doomed to failure like a crème caramel without the caramel.”

Coppelia nodded, all the while nibbling on a macaron from her own pouch.

“Oh. You’re right. I feel a lot better now.”

I smiled brightly.

Indeed! I cared not how insistent Roland was that burned coffee paste was the same colour and had its own unique flavour profile. It was dire. And so was whatever dreadful scheme this was.

“This is a rare smidgeon of luck,” I said with a nod. “We can now proceed with a skip in our steps … provided that it leaves enough room to skip over the holes in the ground. Sadly, I must still take your homeland into account.” 

“We’re not that bad.” Coppelia paused. “... Actually, nevermind.”

“Exactly. To be felled by a piano now would be an embarrassment my kingdom could never recover from. With that in mind, I suggest we proceed to whatever trials and tribulations await us with both caution and disdain. But mostly disdain.”

“Okie\~”

Coppelia gave a lazy smile. 

It wasn’t quite the frown I wanted … but disdain came in many forms. And against the litany of trapped corridors, bottomless pits and toppling cheese the schemers of Ouzelia would toss at me, casual disregard was also appropriate.

Thus, I wasted no time in leading the way.

Paying little attention to the affront against intrigue around me, I strolled past the gathering of schemers. A tiny whiff of home as I ignored all the dealings in the shadows of my father’s court. 

Except this time, it wasn’t the kitchens which awaited my excursion from my bedroom. 

It was a discreet wooden door waiting at the end of the cavern. 

Dull enough to be mistaken for a servants’ entrance, I’d scoffed at enough brochures to know about the cost-saving ploys of mountain lairs. Where a vault door into the depths was unaffordable, simple trickery was used instead.

A surprise, then.

This one came with an additional level of deception.

A plaque to the side, its shininess clashing horrifically against the unvarnished door.

*Inner Sanctum*

*The Bewitching Oracle*

I rubbed my eyes.

Strangely, the words failed to change.

I peered around the door, searching for another sign pointing to where the corridors bristling with magic, arrows and acid pits could be found. There wasn’t any.

“... Coppelia, why does this door suggest we’ve already reached our destination?”

“I think because we have. Gosh. We barely made it.”

My loyal handmaiden giggled. I felt nothing but grief.

“0/10,” I declared without hesitation. “The worst trap I’ve ever seen. Whoever invented this desperately needs a stroll through Clarise’s observatory. Perhaps an exploding tile could trigger a flashback to a childhood where creativity still existed.”

Coppelia leaned forwards, squinting as she peered through a keyhole.

“Hmmmm … I’m not sure I can give this one a rating.”

“True, it’s certainly passed the point of ineligibility. This is an insult to what’s found even in brochures. Such a door needs to come at the climax of a weary and bloody excursion when all thoughts of caution are disregarded by the lure of an ending. Which amateur puts this right at the *beginning*?”

Coppelia leaned back. She tapped her heel against the ground, then peered high into the ceiling.

“Actually, I think this might just be a door.”

“Excuse me?”

“I don’t think it’s trapped. There’s no lesions for any falling objects or parting surfaces. I’m not getting any magic from the door itself and there’s definitely something wider than a trapped corridor beyond. A big room with someone inside.”

Demonstrating a subtlety to match my own, Coppelia flicked at the door.

Nothing exploded.

“... Congratulations!” she said with a beam. “I think this might be it! Your journey in Ouzelia is almost over\~”

I shook my head at once.

“This can’t be *it*, Coppelia. This is never it.”

“True, there’s probably something that will eat you with tiny little teeth on the other side. But you’re also due some luck. Ouzelia is about give and take” 

“In that case, I only expect to be given a catapulted fruit slime. Little else can match the quality of such a low-grade trap.”

Thus–with all the lack of regard it deserved, I stepped back only slightly as Coppelia prodded the door open.

*Creaaak*.

Not even a semblance of resistance. 

Despite the presence of a keyhole, it wasn’t even locked. I waited as the door swung open, hoping against hope. And yet despite the noise Coppelia was generously adding to by closing and opening the door again, no rush of guards came to greet us. 

All I saw instead was the sight of an altogether different cavern.

The roughly hewn walls still remained, but this one came elevated with matching tiles, fluted pillars, a stone altar and even the faint rays of dusk seeping through cracks in the wall like light through a stained window.

It was almost akin to a temple. One where the greatest feature was the ability to wash the masses which came to seek wisdom here. 

A shallow pool made up the centre of the room. 

However, despite being wide enough to host the drunkards in the main cavern, it was instead occupied by a single user.

A woman sitting upon the top of the steps leading into the basin.

I knew at once she was as comely a maiden as my knights could stop to harass.

Long lashes, soft features, kind eyes and a demure expression to match her robes. Hers were even simpler than her followers. They were brown like the pilgrims which clogged up the street outside Reitzlake Cathedral, but devoid of the mud which also caked them. 

For a moment, she did nothing, instead allowing her bare feet to soak within the waters. Then, as she twisted a braid of scarlet hair, she finally looked up and smiled.

“Welcome to my meeting room,” said the Bewitching Oracle, her voice light and sociable, as though she were inviting us to a table in a tavern. “Please come inside. Would you like to take a seat?”

She gestured at the stone steps beside her.

I ignored the invitation as I slowly stepped inside, waiting instead for the *click* to hail the coming volley of acid arrows. Still, nothing came.

“Are you the Bewitching Oracle?” I queried while expertly poking the tiles before me.

“I am, indeed.”

“The leader of this cult?”

“Yes.”

“The one who stole a dragon?”

“So it is said.”

I nodded. And then I prodded at a potted fern on a stand. Coppelia’s diligence went even further as she picked up a small vase and studied its value.

“Why isn’t anything exploding?” I asked, daring to tempt fate. “And for what reason are you here and not at the end of a long and winding maze?”

“Well, I suppose the answer to both is practicality.”

“You’ve a bespoke trap?”

“No. This isn’t a trap.”

“I don’t understand.” 

“This is neither a trap nor a maze. I think it’d be rather tiresome if it took an odyssey just to meet with me. I pride myself on being personable, so there’s no need to go through any needless trials. My door is just a short walk from the entrance outside.”

She offered a smile bereft of deceit. 

I retreated a step, more appalled than by any amount of nobility she had gathered.

“Surely … Surely you jest?”

“Excuse me?”

“Are you claiming that not only is none of the decorations set to explode, but that this is the full extent of your mountain? A *mountain*. Why have a mountain if not to make financially extravagant use of the space?”

“Because mountains are cozy. And also very hard to dig through.”

I was stunned.

Why … I expected little and received less … but *this*?

“Outrageous. What sort of bottom-tier, throwaway side distraction are you to not even possess a falling piano? Do you *know* where you are?”

“Yes. My inner sanctum. Also my meeting room. Falling pianos are very dangerous. I wouldn’t want any needless injuries while I’m working.”

“Where are your guards? Your private army of hirelings?”

“I don’t have any.”

“I saw goons outside wielding cudgels.”

“Those are not weapons. They are tools to help grind the incense powder I use for my candles. Everyone likes to help, so everyone receives one.”

I threw up my arms in exasperation.

“You have a responsibility! If you’re going to form a cult and steal a dragon you need to follow through with every part! This half-heartedness is a disgrace! Do you have any notion of how much I’ve been inconvenienced to be here?”

The scarlet haired maiden gave a smile.

“Responsibility is rarely a thing monopolised by one,” she said with a hint of amusement. “For we are all entangled by the vines of this world. The dew sings while the songbird withers. Nothing taken is given, and nothing given is taken.”

I jabbed my finger towards her.

“Do not reply with vague words while pretending they make sense! And that last bit is literally just the same sentence repeated in reverse! … Where is the dragon?! I have a very busy schedule, and every item on the agenda is to return home!”

The Bewitching Oracle laughed. A tinkling sound which rang as much within this sanctum as it did within my very head.

“I’m sorry,” she said, her tone laced with appalling over-familiarity. “It’s hard to break from my role. But I hope to now finally see that chance come true. I’ve been waiting for you. And I believe we’ve much to offer each other. So please, take a seat. I highly advise it.”

“I shall remain standing. I don’t intend to stay, not least for unsolicited advice.”

“Ah? But mine is excellent. And I’ve so much to offer for a princess from afar.”

My response was lost to Coppelia’s audible hum.

No longer busying herself by valuing the items to be used as initial compensation for my time, she was instead studying the smiling maiden as she would a new breed of hoodlum.

“Yup\~ something about her isn’t right.”

“Well, that much is obvious. To not even have a single corrosive geyser hiding at the bottom of this water basin is obscene. At what point does she intend to douse us with a spray of acid?”

Coppelia leaned forwards slightly. Her eyes squinted slightly. 

“Actually, I don't think she can.”

Without offering an explanation, she promptly lifted up a silver vase. She thought about it for a moment, then put it down and picked up a brass one instead.

And just like that–she casually lobbed it towards the sitting woman.

*Pwish*.

Only to see it pass through and into the basin.

An illusion.

“Ooooh\~ that’s a really unique one!” said Coppelia with a nod of appreciation. “Not a trace of magic whatsoever! And not even because it’s being hidden!”

I regarded the smiling visage with curiosity.

“How odd. She appears exceptionally lifelike. I can even smell the incense from her.”

“Yeah. That’s because this illusion is special. It doesn’t actually exist.”

“I fail to understand. Isn’t that the nature of illusions?”

“No, what I mean is that this illusion *really* doesn't exist. I think it’s being projected directly into our heads. That’s why she’s so real.”

I had nothing but bewilderment. And also slight concern. My head was sacred. Answers to questions that my tutors claimed were wrong were held in there, such was the amount of layers in my mind.

“Directly into our *heads*? Who can even do that?”

*Pwip. Pwip. Pwip.*

A moment later, the sound of falling liquid answered.

I turned to see a wet pool already on the floor … and then the dribbling which caused it.

Descending from the ceiling, the great frame of a bulbous horror floated down. 

An amalgamation of nightmare and shadows. 

A dozen tendrils crawled like the hair of a medusa, surrounding a giant lidless eye as scarlet as the hair of the woman who had now vanished into the abyss. 

For that is where this creature had come from. 

As its grotesque tongue flopped beyond twin rows of countless fangs, its pulsing iris jerked a thousand times in a single moment. I sensed with a shiver as every inch of us was appraised, before the horror broke into a twisted impression of a smile.

*Bwam*.

The door to the sanctum slammed shut to an invisible hand.

I hummed for a moment.

And then–I nodded in satisfaction.

“Very well. I withdraw my criticisms.”

President Claudia Sheinbaum pledged Tuesday to revive those often shabby, limited government stores and continue efforts to achieve “food sovereignty.”

Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegué said the focus would be on guaranteeing prices for farmers who grow corn used for tortillas and lowering tortilla prices by 10%, after prices jumped a couple of years ago.

The government aims to boost bean production by about 30% in six years to replace imports of beans, and will set up research centers to supply higher-yielding bean seeds.

The government will also focus on supporting coffee production, but mainly for instant coffee, which it claims is used by 84% of Mexican households. The plan will also seek to support cocoa production, but mainly for powdered baking and hot chocolate, not fine chocolate bars.

In terms of music taste, I'm willing to listen to any genre as long as the track sounds good to me. But I tend to enjoy electronic music, pop, and hip hop. I also tend to overplay songs, sometimes for hours and hours.

In my free time, I sometimes go walking.

Does he like me?,"I’ve been going out with my boyfriend for three months or so, but we’ve been friends for a little longer. He saw me in a coffee shop and spent months gushing to one of our mutual friends about how i was the most beautiful girl he’d ever seen and out of his league.
He is everything I could want, funny, kind, smart and is perfect for me and tends to show he cares through acts of service and physical touch which I love. 
The issue starts with the fact that we’ve never actually established ourselves as boyfriend and girlfriend verbally. I was under the impression that it needed to be asked, but eventually I thought it was assumed as we’re at eachothers places everyday and have met eachothers parents. But it still bothers me that he’s never asked or acknowledged me as such.
Then comes the lack of verbal affection. Like I said, he is always physically affectionate, we are constantly cuddling, kissing or holding hands, but his speech just doesn’t match. He’s only told me i’m beautiful explicitly once (and he was drunk), though he otherwise just implies it occasionally. I’ll text him that I miss him and he doesn’t say it back. We don’t even really talk about the fact that we’re in a relationship…
Though he often shows a lot of care for me in his words, he is not good at vocalising explicit appreciation and romance you would expect in a relationship, and i try to understand that he probably just has difficulty communicating, but it gets down on me sometimes. I got him a small gift today for doing an exam he worked super hard for and he hardly showed any appreciation with words… it killed me a little.
I want to emphasise he is the sweetest guy i know although it sounds bad. I don’t think he means ill. I just don’t know what to do as i don’t want to make him uncomfortable bringing it up - does he even really like me?

1g9w8zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1g9w8zr/survived_suprep_and_first_colonoscopy/,Survived Suprep and first colonoscopy ,"I had my first today and had the Suprep kit to prepare. I was SO nervous, my anxiety was through the roof. Nausea and vomiting cause me extreme anxiety so I had been dreading this for weeks. Here are a few tips for Suprep that helped me:

1. Chill and drink cold. (I put the mixture in the fridge about an hour before drinking)
2. Drink through a straw.
3. Bite/suck on a lime wedge after every drink.
4. Put on a movie they will distract you from what you’re doing. (I watched Deadpool last night and Ready or Not this morning) 
5. Have a variety of drinks to sip after you drink the prep - I had water, seltzer and ginger ale all handy and took small sips if I needed a break. 

My appointment was at 2:30 today with a 1:30 arrival. I started my prep at 5pm Monday, and it went to work almost immediately. I didn’t have any cramping really, which surprised me. The feeling is not really like having the flu, but the urgency is real. I had bouillon and green jello for “dinner” and went to bed. In the morning I was REALLY dreading pt. 2 but it was not all that bad. I woke up nauseous but had some black coffee then some tea, and started pt. 2 at 9:30am. I basically finished that prep in the bathroom as everything was moving quickly.

I got to my facility at 1:30 and was done and out of there by 4:00. I had 5 polyps removed which does concern me, and I have to go back in 3 years, but I am 45 (and a previous cancer survivor) and this was my first one. I’m so glad I got it done now instead of waiting until I’m 50 and potentially having more issues.

What do? ","Normally I'd trust my doctor, but she is older and sometimes drops the ball on my care. Doesn't notice things she should sometimes. 

Reasons I think I have it: 


- Sometimes I stand up and I feel so dizzy and awful I think I'm going to pass out

- Feet & hands are frequently cold

- I get these tiny red dots (petechiae) all over my legs and arms and while researching those, realized they are a symptom of anemia. I told my doctor about those and she just wanted to cut them off and biopsy them or whatever. 

- I bruise INSANELY easy and bruise for a long time. I currently have a 3 month old bruise on my knee that hasn't gone away. 


- I've been told by every nurse and piercer I've been to that I'm a ""bleeder"". I've been asked if I take blood thinners, drink coffee, take advil, all of which is a no. 


- Constantly tired. Can sleep 20 hours and still be tired

- Hair loss

- Shortness of breath 

- I feel very weak all the time

- Very pale

I also feel like my symptoms get worse around my period. I have an INSANELY heavy period and I always feel worse when it happens. I also know I'm lacking in a lot of nutrients because I basically eat nothing. What I do eat is non nutritional frozen/packaged processed shit that gives me nothing. I realize this is an issue I need to work on, I just haven't really been able to. Most food genuinely tastes awful to me, but anyway. 

I have many good reasons to believe I'm anemic, but my doctor wont listen to me. Any advice on how to proceed here? I'm not looking for a diagnosis or for advice treating it, but how do I get my doctors to throughly check these things out and listen to me? What should I specifically be asking about? Should I be asking for a copy of my results? I just feel like my issues are being ignored and even if it's not anemia, something is wrong. Any advice is super appreciated, Thanks!

my baby girl bernese mountain dog riley came home a little over a month ago. she will be 13 weeks on thursday. the first few days-couple weeks were nothing short of a living hell. no sleep, crippling anxiety that made it impossible to get any work done (i’m a full time college student), overwhelming guilt whenever i did leave the house, thinking i had made a terrible mistake and just cost myself my freedom and independence. i am doing this completely alone, i’m a single dog mom and my family and friends live 2 hours away, so i don’t have the option to call in reinforcements. i was depressed and i genuinely just didn’t like her - i love her and i want to do everything to keep her safe and healthy - but i didn’t like her. 

we really have turned a corner in just the last 2 weeks. we’re learning each other and she’s catching onto what is expected of her. as of about 3 days ago, she is sleeping through the night and not waking up until about 7am. she is becoming a little more independent every day and slowly earning my trust. she likes to sit outside on the screened-in porch in the cool mornings, so i get a moment of peace to drink my coffee while i supervise her from the window in the living room. she hasn’t had an accident in the house in about a week, and our biggest struggle: the crate… she goes in at about 10am every day before i go to class, and then comes out when i come home for lunch at noon. this morning, she went in and immediately laid down, and was asleep when i got home 🥳 i had to call my mom because i was so proud and excited - the little wins are worth celebrating too! we’ve got a nice little routine down and i actually find myself missing her when she’s asleep or when i’m away - and you would not have heard me say that when she first came home. 

if you’re struggling, here’s what helped us: 

-enforced naps. enforced naps. enforced naps. a routine really helps with this. after breakfast, some outside playtime in the morning, and time dedicated to a chew toy, riley knows it’s naptime from about 9-10am while i get ready for the day. she will sleep in the bathroom while i shower, and is still sleepy when we go outside for a potty break before she goes in her crate. 

-obviously it’s hard to get adequate socialization before they’re fully vaccinated. schedule play dates with dogs + owners you know and trust. riley loves my parent’s dog and honestly i believe her behavior improved after hanging out with a well trained adult dog. 

-lower your expectations! slow down. they don’t have to learn everything in a week. for some reason i thought riley would come home a perfect dog. once i let go of the need for perfection and relaxed a little bit, we got along much better. they will get there in time. i have to remind myself a million times a day that she’s just a baby and she deserves my patience. 

obviously we have a long journey ahead of us (i live in fear of the teenager phase), but it seriously does get a little easier every day. the days are long but the weeks are flying by, and this girl gives me a purpose i never thought i could have. ",16,1729638906.0,puppy101,2,1.0,False
1g9vyrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawCanada/comments/1g9vyrw/atypical_law_grad_in_need_of_career_advice/,Atypical Law Grad in need of Career Advice,"Hi everyone

I’m going to try to make this as concise as possible for anyone who cares to read it but I kind of have a bit of a convoluted story so sorry for that. I’m looking for some advice on the best way to move forward with my career (I.e. qualify as a lawyer) given my non-typical legal education and background.

  
**My background (you don't have to read this but it will make everything make sense a bit more.)**

I am originally from England and immigrated to Canada in late 2023 to be with my spouse.  I graduated from UK law school in September 2022 and completed my National Committee on Accreditation exams by March 2023. (NOTE: I know we have a lot of UK LLB haters on this sub but please bare in mind that I took the route which was available to me as someone who grew up in the UK and I could not have predicted to future to go to set myself up to go to law school in Canada or gained some mystery funding source to go to law school in Canada.) I graduated law school with top grades, which I understand means nothing to people here because I didn't go to a Canadian school. The fact is that a 'first class' grade in England is 70% because papers are graded more harshly. There is a 'glass ceiling' at 80% meaning that it is extremely rare for anyone to get above 80% in any given class. I did. Several times. I averaged a 78%. I am a first generation student and do not have a strong financial backing from family or friends.

After graduating law school I worked as a legal assistant/ law clerk at a national organisation in the UK in the areas of employment and professional disciplinary law. Due to differences in the training structure of English lawyers, this role was designed to progress you into being a proficient lawyer, and I did a lot of drafting of witness statements, direct client communication and strategy work in this role. It was definitely more of a substantive role than an administrative one.

I began looking for a way to immigrate to Canada and be with my spouse during this time. Because I knew that I was to going be in Canada within the next year, in 2023 I applied for the 2024-2025 articling recruit. During this recruit I took a very wide approach, applying to \~60 articling positions in Toronto/GTA. To be honest, I feel that my cover letters were not drafted in the way that I now would want them to be and I understand my lack of success in the recruit especially considering my materials had my UK address on as I hadn’t moved yet. Regardless I got one interview at MAG’s Crown Law Office Criminal, but I received no offer. I was in another competition with MAG for a Law Clerk position at the time that I was almost certain that I would get an offer for, but unfortunately due to conflicting immigration timelines I did not get that position. Due to my upset, I did not ask for feedback for my articling interview, assuming that a large part of me not getting the position was due to me being overseas.

I then moved to Canada in late 2023. I worked in the service industry whilst attempting to find a position at a firm. I applied to many law clerk positions but I was seen as over qualified and not having the correct specialization (based on a few interviews I had for these positions). I also applied to about 20-30 off-season articling positions. I got two interviews this way. The first one of those didn't work out because I feel as though me and the firm did not share the same interests. The other was frankly a bit traumatising. The current articling student hyped me and my qualifications up only for the lawyer to walk in and quite literally throw my resume off of his desk, talk about how I was not qualified for the position because of my lack of an undergrad before law school (standard in the UK, which he would know since ironically he also studied in the UK), made disparaging comments about people with mental health difficulties, talked about how crazy his office was and how people walk out of there crying every day (not sure how this is a flex?) and made disparaging comments about my age, as I am younger than the typical applicant for an articling position.  Anyway, he invited me for a ‘test day’, which in my desperate position I decided to take. I went there and didn’t see the lawyer all day. This all ended in the lawyer offering me a SIX MONTH unpaid internship with a CHANCE to be considered for an articling position at the end. I said no to this offer because I was already just trying to make ends meet with my minimum wage job and my partner’s income and quite frankly because I have enough self respect to see that my life would have probably been hellish if I took the position, which also had no possibility of hire back.

Between October 2023 and May 2024 I spent my time working my ass off full time (and beyond) at my day job whilst also having the part time job of trying to figure out what the hell to do with my legal career. By this point I had honestly lost hope and thought that there was no place at all in the legal field for me here. I was also struggling daily with chronic depression and ASD. Regardless, I made a variety of trial and error kind off small efforts towards my career. I learned about things like the way that networking works here, law associations, and made some attempts to network etc. I also competed in a Mock Trial. These months were a huge learning experience for me even if I don’t have a lot to show for it resume wise.

Anyway, obviously I applied to the 2025-2026 recruit earlier this year. I applied to \~30 articling positions with more tailored applications. I got 2 GTA interviews and none in Toronto, both of the interview being with prominent full-service firms in the GTA/ Hamilton.  For one of them, the main interviewer seemed to be concerned with my ‘lack of life experience’ and was concerned with the fact that during the time before the 2025 articling season I could just start a different position because I was qualified to do so. If only everyone thought that favourably of my application. With the other firm, I caught them at the end of a long day of interviews and they were clearly over it at that point.

Luckily, I managed to secure a position as a legal assistant at a mid-size firm in Toronto. The HR manager had recognised me from when I had previously applied for articling at the firm 2024-2025, which had ended up being cancelled due to their articling student at the time being hired back. However, they were also hiring for articling students for 2025-2026 during the interim between my interview and hire date. I was told not to apply to this position because they wanted a legal assistant position filled for at least 1-2 years. Looking back at this I’m not sure if this should have been a red flag, and I'm wondering if they were trying to hire me whilst thinking that I would never be the type of candidate they would hire for articles. Anyway this is what I am currently doing, which has freed up a lot of time and energy for me and has given me more financial security.

**The current plan** 

I don’t really want to article/ do the LPP in 2025-2026 to be honest. I have a lot going on, and personal goals that I am working on like getting my PR and learning to drive, as well as building more of a social support network in Canada. So I am targeting 2026-2027. Even though part of me cringes at this because I naturally am very ambitious and like pushing the limits of what is possible for myself. Also, I find my current role very tedious, as my brain is not engaged in the same capacity as it would be if I was doing something more substantive.

So here is my plan:

* I have properly researched and made a chart of all of my target firms and the people there who I feel like I have very specific question about their careers etc. to ask. From January - May 2025 I will focus on getting coffees with these people in the run up to the recruit.
* During this time, I will also be working on some cover letters for the May/June recruit. I now know all of the regular players and have kept records of the job descriptions for their articling etc. I can improve my cover letters towards a style that I have had more success with.
* If things don’t go to plan, between September 2025 and July 2026 I will literally email every single firm that I can to see if they have an articling position open or know anyone who does.
* In Nov 2025 I will write the bar.
* If I don’t have an articling position by July of 2026 then I will do the LPP.
* Of course during this time I will also be doing CLE and attending events.

**Here are my questions for you all:**

1. Does the plan above sound like a good one?
2. How can I make sure that my transferable skills and grades stand out to Canadian employers when they have a line of people with very easy to recognise institutions and qualifications out their door?
3. How can I make clear the differences in grading system between the UK and Canada in my applications?
4. Should I be re-applying for articling positions at places where I have given an interview and got rejected before? Would they automatically reject me?
5. Do I have to stay loyal to my current firm and stay there for 2 years? Will breaking my loyalty have an effect on my reputation (if I get an articling position at some point during the next 1.5 yr)  even if I explain to the firm why I can’t pass up an articling opportunity if one comes along?
6. How can I network in my current firm? It feels weird being a member of support staff and trying to set up meetings with lawyers who I don’t work with on a daily basis to discuss their careers.
7. How can I make an impact in my current firm which goes beyond my practice group?
8. How can I use my time working as a legal assistant to maximise my readiness for an articling position when one does come?
9. I am younger than the typical lawyer candidate by a little bit. When I go to networking events I feel intimidated because of the lack of people in my age demographic (my baby face also does not help). Any tips on this?
10. How can I show my current firm that I would be a good articling candidate?
11. Any advice on how not to feel like a failure?
12. Any other advice to contribute?

  
I hope someone replies to this because I feel as though unlike in the UK, where it is expected that your path into becoming a lawyer may take you in different directions, the route is rather straight and narrow here, and I feel very alone. I also feel alone because unlike those who went to law school here, I don't have access to people who are in the same boat as me, or who know what I'm going through. I would love to have a bit of a community of people who are in the same career stage/ age group as me. But I find that people automatically put their guard up towards those who have studied abroad, assuming that they did this because they wouldn't be able to get into law school here, when the reality is that I just have a unique circumstance on my hands.

Anyways, I'm not expecting the replies to be kind based on some previous threads I have read, so let it rip, but if anyone does have any useful advice please send it my way. Thanks in advance.",0,1729638828.0,LawCanada,3,0.33,False
1g9vv13,https://www.reddit.com/r/ausadhd/comments/1g9vv13/sleepiness_on_dexamphetamine/,Sleepiness on dexamphetamine ,"I just got diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed dexamphetamine. My starting dose is 5mg daily for a week, then double that for the next week, and so on.

I just took my first doses in the past few days at 8am in the morning and everytime I've been hit with drowsiness so intense that I take a nap for one hour before getting up again.  Other than this, I've noticed no other effects. I also get sleepy on low doses of caffeine (e.g 50mg or one coffee).

Is this a common occurrence? Could it also be amplifying the fatigue that I get during my period?

I am quite worried about the meds not working out for me and what happens if I actually don't have ADHD but I'm just lazy. It would be great to hear some of your experiences to ease my mind.

1g9vt11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g9vt11/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,I don’t know what to do ,"For context, I’m 22 years old. I grew up in a family that was upper class. Not insanely rich in a way that I can just do whatever I want and get rich from my parents business, but we were above middle class. Growing up I thought that my dad was a respected business man but only as I got older I realised that all the money he made was by scamming people that trusted him. Then declare his business bankrupt and search for the next victim. Honestly when I was 16 years old I didn't really care, and even if I did what was I gonna do about it either way (?) The point is, growing up money was never the problem, but family dynamics were insane. My dad physically abused my mom even before we were born but she stayed for financial reasons as she came from an extremely poor family and left her house at 16. And by the time he got violent she was pregnant with my brother. She grew up without a dad so she said that the last thing she wanted is for her kids to grow up without a dad. My dad was only physically abusive to me a couple of times. My mum turned physically abusive as well, she learned from him ig, but while she just slapped me in the face or shouted he was much more aggressive. Once he took a metal stick and just started hitting me with it while my mom and siblings just watched. Both were also verbally abusive to me and my siblings. Always telling us how worthless and stupid we are. There were always arguments… between my parents or involving me and my siblings. I always wished for a normal loving family, but as I got older I understood that it's something that I will never get, so I might as well use my dad for his money. In high school I got excellent grades and I got a spot in one of the UK's Russell Group universities (I lived in Spain at that time). I think what kept me going was knowing that my days in that house are counted, and that I will soon be far far away from them and start my life. So at 18 I moved to the UK for university, with my dad agreeing to pay the tuition. The next 2 years were pretty normal… I went to class, made new friends, argued less with my parents as I barely saw them, and met my current boyfriend (22M). Everything changed when my mum called me 2 years ago and said shes divorcing my dad. My first reaction was to be happy for her. Despite of our rocky relationship I wanted her to be happy. He wad an abuser and a cheater and she deserved someone better. She always wanted to leave but only now made the step because my brother and I now moved out, and it was only my sister (10F) left, but she just couldnt handle it anymore. plus she got in touch with her first love, and they wanted to reunite and be together. i honestly didnt give a sh*t who she's with as long as she was happy. She asked me not to tell my dad for now and I agreed, as she said she will deal with it herself. Well long story short, everything went to sh*it pretty quickly. When I came to visit my parents, she didnt even come to pick me up from the airport (we didnt see each other for more than half a year) and when I came home she was locked in her room loudly speaking to ""someone"" (her new bf) on the phone. Please mind that my dad still knew nothing about her leaving or this new person in her life. When I saw her, she was completely different. Lost 20+kg, botox, different hair… but that was not the worst. During the week that I was there she hasnt asked once how Ive been, how was uni etc… and I asked her so many times to go for a coffee, a walk or do smth together. none of these things happened bc all she did all day was lock herself in a room and talk to her bf in the phone as if we are all stupid and cant see whats going on. Obviously my dad figured out what was going on bc she didnt even try to hide it. Well, the day we dropped my mum off in the airport bc she was travelling to see ""her mum"" (her bf) my dad just told me: ""listen maybe you dont understand what is going on but your mum
found someone else"". I just broke down crying idk why, it was so weird. Well after that my dad was calling her non stop trying to get her back and Ive been supporting my dad all this time bc I felt so bad. He was already 60 at that time and the thought of him alone broke my heart despite of the monster that he is. Well, it came time for me to go back to uni for my final year and so I did, and we all just kinda assumed this new reality where my parents separated and that was it. But this sh*t was just getting started. So, another important person to talk about here is my boyfriend. we met at a party in my second year of uni and we became inseparable so quickly. He took me out to eat, gave me gifts, and even paid for an entire trip to Tenerife before we even started dating, and asked me to be his gf in that trip. He made me so so happy. Obviously not only bc of all this materialistic gestures but bc we just clicked so well. we had the same interests and genuinely always had a good time. For additional context I dated someone for a year when I was 16, who isolates me from all of my friends, cheated, and overall was just not a nice person. so after that experience I didnt go on any dates for around 3 years as I really needed to heal, but when I met my now bf everything just seemed right and I went for it. Ok so, this is when things really started to take a turn. So a few months into our relationship, I notice how my bf is just suddenly so stressed. I didnt understand wtf is going on bc he is an easy going generally cheerful person, and when I tried to talk to him he always said eveeything is fine but I could just feel smth is off. That continued for a couple of months, and then it was my brothers birthday and we decided to go out with him and another one of my brothers friends to celebrate. He got a bit drunk and thats when he confessed that he is feeling that way bc he is in extreme credit card debt. I had no idea. i just assumed his parents are well off as even before we started dating he and his friends were always traveling around europe, partying…. and if i knew i would have never let him spend so much money on me. He said he was scared to tell me bc he didnt want to loose me now that we won’t be able to do so many plans or he won’t be able to give me so many things. I told him that I really didn’t care, that I love him and we will get through it together. And that was that. As he had the settled status in the UK, he had government loans that paid for his tuition and he classified for financial aid so that’s the money he lived with. Eventually, he moved in with me and everything was ok. Gradually, I started helping him with money. First it was small quantities that I really didn’t think much of, and I always thought… well he gave me so much, ofc I’m going to help me. But at some point it genuinely started bothering me. Bc as I said, my dad was well off but he didn’t have unlimited money. I had an allowance that was just right to pay rent, bills, and socialise with friends from time to time. Since we started dating I started asking my dad for more and more money, and he didn’t understand why bc I’ve always been responsible with my finances and never over spent in unnecessary stuff. Well, one day I just couldn’t handle it anymore and I told my bf that he will need to get a part time job bc my allowance is not big enough to sustain the living of 2 people. My dad paid the full 1 year in rent to our landlord bc we didn’t have a guarantor and we were students, and my bf promised to be paying my dad back every month for his half. My dad told me that my bf should just send the money to me, and that amount will be deducted from my original allowance. in reality, my bf was defaulting in all payments and he even needed me to lend him money at the end of every month. I was just too embarrased to tell my dad thaty bf is doing that. My bf finally got a part time job but he was just not making enough bc his shifts were 6h a week. I encouraged him to take extra shifts but he said it's impossible bc uni is too demanding… and I get that but then the one being damaged is me bc I had to always put extra money for groceries, bills… and obviously if im eating im not leaving my bf without food so i just had to pay for both. On top of this we had other problems. So, back at the beginning of our relationship he had a girl ""friend"". I didnt think much of it until one day I accudentally saw some of their messages and they were quite flirty. my heart just broke. We JUST started dating, thats the best part! when everything is perfect… And he was already doing that… i didnt say much and just went home. He came to my house the next day and started apologising, saying i was his first gf, that it was stupid to do that, and that he will not do that again. It was just messages so I forgave that on the basis that they wont talk again. well… ofc they did. He went to a bar with his friends and i asked him be honest, is she going to be there? i just want to know the truth. he said no. well i figured out later that she was in fact there. that night he came back over to my place and i asked him what happened. he said that his friend asked him to go home with her and thats when he realised that I am right and she is really not a friend. he was so sorry and thought im being jealous over nothing but after she said that he knew i was right. He blocked her from everything and we went on with our lives. During christmas vacation, i noticed he was following her on instgram again. I was so annoyed… we already had 2 arguments bc of her and he willingly blocked her…. why was she there again? I confronted him about it and he gave me some reason that was obviously an excuse (""a friend wanted to see how she looks bc they might know each other"") yeah… non sense. i pretended to believe it bc he was soon coming to meet my dad for the first time and I didnt want to argue so I let that be. Not until months later that i broke down crying and he admitted that he followed her again bc he felt bad for her and didnt want to be on bad terms. Honestly, what bothered me more than her was the lies. Well, we moved past that as well but the next situation occured when I was in a ""fight"" with one of my friends at the time. Basically, stuff happened and I just didnt want her in my life anymore. i was talking to my bf about it and crying bc it hurted me the things she did while i thought shes my best friend. well, suddenly i see him on his phone in the middle of me opening my heart to him, and  like what are u doing? he goes ""nothing"" and closes his phone quickly. i tell him to let me see and i see that while im crying to him about what my friend did to me, he is texting HER to wish a happy birthday. bc apparently he remembered that he saw her birthday instagram story earlier and didnt happy birthday her, and he didnt want her to feel bad. It was MY friend NOT HIS friend + I am his gf… crying bc of her… like wtf? why does her feeling “upset” matters more than me? Also why would she even be upset? Ok it’s her birthday but they are not friends? I did send her a message earlier on the day by the way… but he had just no business texting her, specially when she hurt me and I’m telling him about it… the timing is just crazy. Well eventually I let that slide as well. Next, I found messages in his phone about how he was bragging to his friends that he will cheat on me in his vacation. I know for a fact that he was going with his parents to a village to visit his grandma. We face timed all the time, and it was literally a village in the middle of nowhere. He has no friends there, and his parents are very strict about alcohol so they would never let him outside despite him being 20 at that time, they just wouldn’t agree. Well basically, I know he was not going to cheat, but why say it to your friends? To seem cool?…. Well after seeing that honestly my trust just broke. And there is more things that I don’t want to get in detail now but the bottom line is that he never cheated but my trust was just not there. I started to be anxious all the time, thinking what is he going to do to me now? When we met I fully trusted him. I didn’t mind him seeing his friends and clubbing without me, he did that and I did that with my friends too. But after all of that I was just too insecure and didn’t want him to go out without me or see his friends. I was embarrassed. Embarrassed that the same people I saw in university are the people whom my bf told that he “cheats on me”. Embarrassed that I sat in the same table with that girl that was her friends. Smiling at her and being nice, when they were both flirting behind my back and I was just there clueless and stupid. Well, I ended up forgiving everything. We established certain boundaries, communicated what was ok and not, and bc he never actually cheated I thought we could just move forward with everything. Well, fast forward again to when we started to live together and having money issues: It was now just 6 months before my graduation, and my dad decided that he is cutting me off. Basically my mum and dad couldn’t decide on a divorce settlement and so he told her if she doesn’t agree to give him all the business instead of splitting 50-50, then he won’t pay for my uni. She didn’t agree. My mother and her bf have no money, she was dependent on the dividends of that business to live so she couldn’t agree, and even that was the bare minimum. Her bf had a minimum wage part time job, and he also had kids and my mum was taking care of my sister, so money was very tight. So my situation was that I am a 20 year old graduating in 6 months and I need 14k to pay my tuition + bills, food, and I was in the UK with my bf who didn’t have money even for himself. Obviously as a student I simply didn’t had this kind of money. The solution was the following; my mum flew to Spain while my dad was on vacation and rented the family home. My dad was obviously furious bc now he had no home, but there was nothing he could do about it bc the contract to rent the house was completely valid so he could do nothing about it. We divided the money from the rent in the following way: Half went to my mum, 1/4 to my brother, and 1/4 to me. Also keep in mind that my brother is older and my dad paid for his university in full, also his first months rent before he started working and he was now working in a great office job, and he even gave him money for extras such as vacation… so my brother was set, but he claimed that as he helped as rent the house he was entitled to a share. I honestly didn’t care, I was just happy that my tuition got paid for and I will be able to graduate. Obviously rent money can only get you so far, bc as I said only 1/4 of the rent money went for me, and 100% of that 1/4 went for my tuition. I told my mum that I appreciate her help but that I can’t live with 0 money in a foreign country, and asked her to loan me some money to live until I start working in summer after I graduate. Tbh I found it quite unfair how my brothers uni got paid for, he lived comfortably and everything was taking care of until he was working, but I had to beg for money and also give it back as soon as possible. I wouldn’t have won anything by arguing so I let that be. In summer, I had an internship secured in a reputable investment bank, so the salary was amazing. Nevertheless, I needed to save that money to pay for a masters that me and my bf agreed to do together. Because after this internship they could only consider me for a job in 1 years time, I wanted to do the internship, do my 1 year master, and start my full time job. To save money I stayed in my brothers house for the summer. He had only one room, so I slept in a mattress that my bf gave me in my brothers kitchen. And believe it or not, I had to pay rent for that. Obviously much cheaper than anywhere else I could find in London, so I agreed. During summer, while my mum took a loan to buy a new car and my brother used my “rent” money to a trip to Egypt, I stayed for 2 months sleeping in that mattress kitchen and worked 15+ hours a day, even most weekends, to make sure I leave a good impression in my internship and get a return offer. I felt physically sick. I didn’t sleep enough, and also there were no blinds in the kitchen so it was just impossible to sleep. The fridge made noice. I was overworked. And just to top it off I had kidney stones so I was feeling so sick. When I got my university final grades, I was super happy to see that I ranked 1st in my entire cohort despite this crazy year. I was so proud of myself. It was sad though that while my brother graduated back in the day and my bf was going with his parents to celebrate his graduation, I couldn’t even attend my ceremony because I was working. The summer was finally over, and with the money I saved, plus a scholarship I got, I could pretty much pay my tuition in full. My boyfriend’s parents agreed to help me a bit, and that was that. Well, one day I get a phone call and the company where I worked decides that they will not hire me for a full time position. All this summer I worked crazy hours, the feedback was amazing, saying how I’m so hard working, the team loves me, my work is great…. Only for me to discover that the 2 other interns did get the job but I was the only one who didn’t and they couldn’t even tell me what did I do wrong. My manager told me he will call me to explain but obviously he NEVER did despite of me messaging him… I couldn’t believe it. I was just so so so close of just making it and leaving all these financial struggles behind. At this point I haven’t talked to my dad for 7 months. I was blocked from everywhere. I owed money to my mom…. I just didn’t know what I’m going to do. I decided to still go through with the masters, as for me to stay in the UK I need to be studying or working as I’m in a visa. My mum was telling me to move to Russia with her and marry there and find a job there as it will be easier. But I just didn’t want to give up. I worked so hard in school, university, in the job. I wanted a better life, I wanted to achieve great things. What is more, my brother and I got accepted to the best university in the UK to do a masters (you know which one) bc after I communicated my plans to do a masters my brother decided to quit his job and do further study. Well, the tuition here was absolutely insane, and while my brother got a loan bc he had work experience and came to the UK before Brexit, I couldn’t get that money anywhere so I had to reject my offer while my brother did this masters and settle for a considerably worse school bc that’s what I could afford, which I was still happy with bc it was the same subject and I just was interested in the program, but obviously it sucks to get to one of the best universities in the world and see how your brother who has always been taken care of is going and you have to settle for a worse uni and keep struggling financially.  
 My masters in the worse uni  also was an amazing option bc my scholarship included paying my part of the rent (I was again living with my bf) so I didn’t have to worry about paying rent or bills, and with the academic scholarship and my money saved I didn’t have to worry about tuition either. So well, the plan was to do the masters and just apply for more jobs and hopefully something comes up. Well, I am writing this sitting now in my apartment in the masters university. My bf found a job so he’s only visiting me in the weekends, while it was  our plan to do this together, so I’m basically here by myself. I’ve been applying to so many jobs and literally no one wants to even give me an interview. As I said I graduated with the best grade for my bachelors in business, I am now doing finance for my masters (both unis Russell group) have experience is investment banking and speak 3 languages, and still. No one wants to interview me and is just not interested in giving me the chance to get a job. I can’t focus on my masters bc all I think about is how I will graduate and have no job. I have no family that will be able to help bc as I said my dad and I don’t talk anymore (11 months now), my mum doesn’t have the money, and my bf is also too young to take care of both of us. Furthermore, if I don’t get a job here I will have to leave the country bc as I said I’m in a visa here. I have nowhere to go. I’ve been trying to communicate it with my bf that we should think about moving to Spain (we both have a Spanish passport) as the market is less competitive than here and it will be easier for me to get a job there bc here so many companies just don’t want to sponsor you if you’re in a visa so that just makes it extra hard for me to get a job + if I don’t get a job I simply cant stay here. He always brushes it off saying that I will get smth that I have to wait but honestly I’m tired of waiting he just doesn’t get it. My life is literally falling apart. I don’t have the energy anymore to socialise and meet people, I am so anxious and unhappy that I don’t know what to do. My dad literally sent me to a foreign country and dropped me here. My mum left him not giving a damn what am I going to do, while she waited for my brother to be settled she just didn’t care for me. My sister is skipping school and drinking and smoking at just 13 bc her dad abandoned her and my mum is too financially stressed. I lost all of my fiends from Spain as I’ve been in the UK now for 4 years. I have no friends here at all as it’s a new town for me and because of my current mental state I just can’t be bothered to socialise with anyone and even when I try I just don’t vibe with anyone because I’m internally so unhappy. All I think about is getting a job and not being homeless in 10 months. On top of it I argue with my bf all the time bc I think I just built resentment for all of the things that he has done to me. But I can’t let him go bc deep down I still love him and bc he’s the only way I’m able to sustain myself here bc he’s the only person that hasn’t completely turned his back on me. He says that if I don’t get a job he will marry me so I can stay here but I just don’t want to be a failure. I came here to work and I am trying so hard but this is just not happening. We argue very bad. Shout at each other and say horrible things and hurt each other. I always wanted to get out of my house to find peace but now I can just see myself and I have the face of my mum but the character of my monster dad. I’m angry c snappy, and say horrible things to my bf and then I regret it. And then I feel guilty bc some things I say I genuinely believe bc I just can’t forgive him and it makes me so angry and hurt that he did all of that to me. That he broke my trust and humiliated me. I see him trying, trying to compliment me, do nice things together, we haven’t had one of this “girls” issue ever again but I still just don’t trust him. I sometimes see him as a cold hearted and selfish liar. I would have never done this to him, never. Why was he like that? Why couldn’t he just be as he is today since the day we met. There is so much damage now that I don’t know if we can repair. So many hurtful things said, lies, betrayals…. And part of me wants to excuse his past behaviours as childish mistakes because he was only 20, but also part of me knows that I was 20 too and I wasnt like that. And he just made me so insecure, so insecure and anxious and angry. And when I’m next to him and even everything is fine I suddenly remember how he did this or he did that and I am just so upset. Everyone in my life has done me dirty and I don’t understand why. I never had a loving family. I never had loyal friends. I don’t have a partner that understands me and loves me. I am so alone. I always thought I will leave my house and find my person and build my own happy family. But now I just wonder if that even exists bc all I see is how people argue all the time, divorce, cheat, or worse. I feel like the person I was looking for is just nowhere in this world, and as much as I want that person to be my bf I know that the love of my life wouldn’t do me this dirty… or at least I want to believe that. Bc if I give up and settle I would just be assuming that real love doesn’t exist. I will be one of this unhappy wifes who screams at her children. I am becoming so unhappy that some days I just don’t want to get out of bed. It’s hard to go to class. It annoys me talking to people. Every small task feels like a chore. My anxiety and stress levels are just over the roof. Everything in my life is bad. I have no family, no money, no fiends, and I’m having relationship problems as well. I am even more scared of getting married because I just know that I haven’t forgiven him for everything and I don’t want to spend the rest of my life resenting my husband and then having kids to fill the void and then divorcing as my parents did. I am so completely lost right know. I’ve also applied to jobs in Spain but no response so far. Genuinely it’s just so hard to keep trying at this point. My chest hurts everyday, I have trouble sleeping or oversleep, I get constant headaches and I am just so done. I lost interest in everything. I don’t have any more hobbies. I skip my classes. I gained weight. I can’t recognise the person that I’ve become. I feel so alone and I really just don’t know what to do. 

Sorry for the super long post or if my grammar and timeliness are unclear. Idk if I just wanted to write all of this down for my own sake or I want a response. Honestly not much to say here. Thank you for reading. ",1,1729638377.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
1g9vspo,https://www.reddit.com/r/GaylorSwift/comments/1g9vspo/there_i_was_giving_you_a_second_chance/,"There I was, giving you a SECOND chance","An author Blondie loves to reference, F. Scott Fitzgerald, once wrote, ""**There are no second acts in American lives**."" It sounds bleak at first, doesn’t it? Like he was saying once you’ve messed up or reached a certain point, that’s it – no comebacks, no redos. But was he really that much of a pessimist? Not quite.

This famous line first appeared in Fitzgerald’s 1932 essay ""My Lost City"" and later in his notes for ""The Last Tycoon."" What most people don’t know is that the full sentence actually went: 

>*I once thought that there were no second acts in American lives, but there was certainly to be a second act to New York's boom days.*

So, maybe this wasn’t some down-in-the-dumps, there’s-no-hope declaration after all. 

In fact, scholars and fans of Fitzgerald argue he was actually pointing out the necessity of second chances. According to Kirk Curnutt, vice president of the F. Scott Fitzgerald Society, Fitzgerald believed ""we are always caught between the past and the present, and we carry the burdens of both."" Essentially, his message wasn’t that we’re stuck forever – it’s that starting over is possible. In other words, we all get second acts, even if they don’t look exactly how we imagined them.

Sound familiar? If you’re thinking about another quee~~r~~n of the second act, you’re spot on. Reputation was Taylor’s first shot at personal redemption, reclaiming her story on her terms. Then, enter the masters scandal, and it was taken from her. But instead of giving up, she decided to rewrite her history by re-recording all her old albums. This is her second chance at redemption – or maybe it’s more like her SECOND second chance on Reputation.

But what if the 2s aren't just Reputation eggs? Could Karma be a second chance at coming out? Or perhaps Debut will get a second chance at boom days.

We've noticed the number two popping up all over the place, from cryptic clues in her music videos (Karma MV 2 o'clock coffee cup nail) to the mysterious 2 o’clock references (TTPD Timetable, LA lyric popup timing) to the hand symbols, 2 on Gold Stankyyy, etc. etc. Perhaps these 2s symbolize the final two re-recordings she has left, but maybe, just maybe, they’re also a nod to something deeper: Reinventing, reclaiming, and getting that second chance – **even if it’s the second, third, or hundredth time around claiming it.**

My roommate used to be a close friend before she moved in. Everything was fine at first. A few months in, she started dating a new guy and he was at our house constantly. It was like having a third roommate... who, not to mention, was very messy and lazy and would sleep here until noon when she had already gone to work. Then fast-forward a few months, she and this dude break up. She is lonely and starts going out and partying a bunch, which I don't care about, I have also gone through phases like that. One day I asked her out to lunch because I hadn't seen her in a while. She starts berating me saying that I am with my boyfriend all the time and becoming codependent with him. Says the girl who practically moved her ex into our house within two weeks of them dating. I was pissed and expressed my feelings to her, but we moved past it and she ended up apologizing for what she said. Then she started getting super lazy about helping with housework. She used to deep clean the bathroom once a week (while I did every other chore), but that stopped completely. She has a dog who sheds a bunch and never vacuumed. So I talked to her about that and now we have a chore chart, which I had to buy and organize. She now does deep cleaning items once a week. Yay. Now, she's dating a guy who lives in another state. He came to visit last month and she asked me to stay at my boyfriend's house while he was here so they can have ""privacy"". Mind you, before my boyfriend moved to the same city I got us Airbnb's for Valentine's Day and my birthday so we could have privacy. I would never ask her to not be at the place she pays to live in. I also pay more rent than she does ($300 more). I stayed with my boyfriend. A couple of days ago, I switched MY rug that I had in my room for MY rug that I had in the living room because the one I had in the living room looks better with my room decor. She comes down to the kitchen the next morning while I'm enjoying my coffee and a book and says ""Why did you move the rug, it looks bad, there are too many patterns, maybe no rug there is better"" ???? Wtf. So I explained that I wanted the other rug in my room and she suggested I get a different rug for the living room... I don't say anything and pack the rug up and bring it to my bf's. It looks great there so whatever. She ended up texting me saying she was sorry and she was just grumpy that morning. Ok. Now her long-distance bf is coming to visit this week for a whole week and she, again, asked me if I could stay with my boyfriend. I don't care THAT much, I love being with my boyfriend and prefer to hang out with him at his house anyway. But mind you I have two cats here and I work from home. And I pay $950 in rent to be here whenever I want. And aside from all of this, I don't like to constantly be talking or catching up especially when I'm at home. Whenever I'm in the shared space I get trapped in a conversation with her. I'm so tired. I honestly just feel like there is zero consideration for me and I'm always the one having to compromise. I'm at a point where I want nothing to do with her and am overcome with anxiety when she's home. It feels like it's not even my home anymore when I'm the only one on the lease!

I didn’t take school seriously growing up, and as a result, I didn’t graduate on time with my peers. After high school, I worked full-time at a local coffee shop and spent a year pursuing my dream of becoming a professional soccer player. I even made it to a U-21 team as a goalkeeper. But during that time, I realized many of my teammates had scholarships to universities in the U.S., and that pushed me to reconsider my path.

Motivated by this, I decided to return to school as an adult. I took one course at a time, focusing on science and math to keep my options open for university. I didn’t have a clear passion or calling, so I aimed to give myself the broadest range of choices. I eventually graduated with a 95.5% average and chose civil engineering, primarily for job security. I didn’t feel confident enough to go into tech-heavy fields like electrical or computer engineering back then.

I went on to graduate from what I believe is the best engineering school in Canada, with a 3.7 GPA. Over time, I honed my interests within civil engineering and decided to pursue geotechnical engineering. After graduating, I moved across the country to work as a consultant in tailings management. However, after a year, I started to feel lonely and decided to move back home.

Fortunately, around the same time, I was recruited by a geotechnical software company, where I now work as an application engineer. I was recently promoted to support team lead, thanks to my customer service and leadership skills. While I’ve gained a lot of experience in both engineering and software development, I’ve started feeling burnt out and disconnected from my career.

The truth is, I don’t have a deep passion for soil and rock engineering, and I’m finding it harder to justify the liability that comes with being an engineer, especially for the level of pay, which typically maxes out around $130-150K CAD in my field. While the pay is decent, I don’t see many growth opportunities, and I feel like I’m spending my life doing something I don’t truly enjoy.

I do, however, have strong analytical and communication skills and enjoy mentoring and teaching others. I’ve been told that combining an engineering degree with an MBA can be powerful, but I’m hesitant to commit two years and significant debt without a clear direction. I’ve considered transitioning into roles like product management, especially given my experience in a software company, or perhaps more general consulting. But at this point, I’m uncertain about my next move.

What would you do? I’m starting to lose faith in myself and my self-doubt is becoming more and more prominent. ",1,1729637907.0,careerguidance,1,1.0,False

**To Fall in Love with Me**

My favourite part of falling in love, is how you get to immerse yourself in the world of another. Every human being is a universe of values, an inner realm of experience containing so much meaning and light. And when you fall for someone, you get to lose yourself in the gaze of the other --- seeing the world through their perspective, taking upon the values and meanings of your partner as your own. In that way, my relationships change the way I perceive the world, and my experience of reality becomes all the more vivid through you.

This is my conception of love. And I've realized at a young age that such love does not easily fit within the confines of a single person. That's why I'm looking for two (or perhaps three!) partners to have a polyamorous relationship together. I want us to be a dream-team power-couple (triple?) that'll fall in love together. I want to get to know the world through your perspectives, and feel my heart go a-flutter, at beauty that you can perceive.

**Who am I?**

I'm a 24-year-old research scientist working in the experimental sciences. By day, I delight in sparkling conversations and insightful chats, the subtle dignity of the lab along with the glamour of the conference. But above all, I cherish the world and all the experiences that it has to offer --- whether it be through art, literature, or the humanities.

I am fit, 5'10"" tall, with black hair and brown eyes. I enjoy a good blazer and a collared shirt just as much as hiking boots and a sailing jacket. I suppose my overall aesthetic can be described as comfortably stylish :)

I speak four languages. Three with some fluency, but the rest with just enough skill to get into trouble! Originally from Europe, I grew up in Asia --- and spent a great deal of my youth travelling, until I landed in the U.S. for my job.

In terms of relationships, I've had a poly-relationship before, which I enjoyed immensely. We parted ways as I left the country, but it was an experience that made me realise that being poly was the way for me!

Outside of my work and my studies, I am an avid outdoorsperson. I've hiked and summited some of the highest mountains in my native country, and I hope to go on many more hikes and adventures in the U.S.! One of my dreams is to build out a van, and travel the country with the both of you, visiting trails and parklands, in a tour of the great outdoors.

**Who are you?**

You can be anyone. I'm not looking for someone who is similar to me, but different in ways that are uniquely yours. In particular, I fall for people who are passionate about something --- whether in the arts or the sciences. Whether you're an artist who takes pride in his portraits, or a concert musician who loves the interplay of harmony and sound, I want to hear you speak about your passion, and fall for you. In particular, I'm hoping to meet someone who is talented and skilled in an aspect of the world that is completely novel to me. After all, I want to get to know what's beautiful about our existence through your own, resplendent gaze.

And I want to be clear, I am very much imagining this as a relationship that we are all building together. So if you reach out to me, you should be open to dating and getting to know not just me, but another interesting stranger from Reddit! I believe that since we'll all be getting to know each other at the same time, the relationship can start with a sense of equality.

**What do I want from our relationship?**

I want us to travel together. I want our relationship to grow through coffee-dates and picnics, until our time together feels as effortless and natural as a warm embrace. I don't imagine (nor expect) for each of us to love the other in the *same* way. But rather, I hope the three of us will grow to cherish the unique strengths and natures of the other, until we create something that is uniquely ourselves.

And I very much intend the three of us to be a team, together. Although we might have different skills or careers, I hope that we'll be able to compliment and support each other, in our own unique ways!

Then; ""*about the second thing. (He) asked his driver if he had asked my daughter out and his driver said he hadn't. Besides, the guy has a girlfriend so of course he wouldn't.

And (he) personally know of lots of girls who it's been proven have falsely accused guys of bad things.*""  All of these he said within a span of five minutes on the phone. I lost my temper and told him that I absolutely believe my daughter and that his creep of an employee is in no way automatically innocent because he has a girlfriend. That I had given him a week to get back to me to assure me that his employee had been verbally chastised at the very least and that young girls in town would be safe from him asking them out going forward. Instead he had made it 1000x worse by defending the driver and insisting that my daughter had to be lying about being asked out for coffee by the adult that was being paid to drive her home. I advised Peter that I would be now doing my review of his business based on my daughter's experience and including his response.

At no point enroute does the limit allow for a speed of 80km. She said he was doing 40km over the limit at times.

I usually do a 20 to 25 g dose for single or for two people I double it. It tends to come out less fruity and more chocolatey or nutty. When I follow the exact recipe for 15g as they have it, it tastes a lot brighter, fruitier and floral. To scale it up I usually grind coarser, maybe not course enough. I also wait longer between pours. What is the best way to think of scaling this up in terms of coarseness and time?

Using a V60, 20g (Ethiopian) 5.2 on Ode gen 2. 205F and 45s between pours instead of 30. I do a 5 on Ode gen 2 for 15g dose.

I would say around 4 to 5 months ago, I didn’t know a lot of people but once I got comfortable I sent out an open invite to everyone for bunch. Some people said they would come but no one ended up coming. Which is alright, they could have got busy.

Recently I was just mingling around the break room to get coffee and stood with my coworkers. They started mentioning the previous movie nights and fun times. I just listened to and enjoyed their stories and they had mentioned a movie night this Friday. I honestly thought if there was an outside activity I might have got invited to one but maybe I’m just not in the group ( which is ok ).

As I was going to walk back to my desk the guy that was hosting movie nights told me I can come. I forgot exactly how he worded it but it just felt like I was invited because they talked about it right in front of me because the event is three days from now.

My question is if I should go. I really don’t want to burden people if they didn’t intent for me to go. I feel conflicted to be frank. I don’t think I would have gotten invited if I had accidentally walked in.

What would yall do?

My relationship with my parents has always been tense, partially this is due to the blatant differences in how they have treated my sister and I. She is a few years younger and has had wildly different treatment than me to the point my friends are constantly angry for me. I'll limit the plethora of examples and keep it to what is bothering me today: inheritance and real estate. 

During my undergrad, I chose the cheapest college and still was poor and working throughout my time there. I remember being yelled at for asking for $400 for rent money one month and learned my lesson to never ask again and pick up more work shifts. My sister never had to work and went to a school that was 4x the amount per year; she has never seen a school bill. My parents own 2 rental properties in addition to our house. one was always my sister's inheritance and the other was mine. They sold one to pay for my sister's medical school, so she graduated debt free. 

Bringing us up to now, they are going to sell the second house. They simply don't want to deal with being landlords anymore. I recently moved back to my home state and they asked me to buy it after I already signed a lease. I don't have the down payment money and can't afford the mortgage at these rates. It has sent me into a lot of anxious spiralling, as I'm seeing my inheritance get sold right before me. Whatever mythical family deal they are offering, when they found out what I could offer, they realized I just couldn't afford the house. 

They have been asking me to buy it every week for over a month now and each time I have to say no to the hardest decision ever. Last Thursday they asked again and I finally told my dad what money I have and what I can afford. He's stopped pestering me since. I spent today crying because I can't really say anything about how I'm upset they are selling it when it's really not mine to claim or be entitled to ultimately. I'll never be able to afford a house in my home state despite having a good job because real estate is just outlandish here. 

I've thought about asking them to hold onto it for one more year and I can manage it for them and maybe by then I'll have an adequate down payment if I save really hard and don't contribute much to retirement. I just see my one chance at home ownership in this state slipping away. It just sucks and it sucks I can't talk to them about it and it sucks I can't talk to my sister about it because she always says they'll give me money if I ask but she doesn't really understand that they don't and won't like they do with her. I got upset once on the phone with her about how they were essentially selling my inheritance and we got into a huge fight cuz she said I should say something but like obviously they know what they are doing since the 2 houses, 2 inheritances thing has been told to us since we were kids. 

This post is already too long sorry. 

tl;dr: My parents are selling off my inheritance and that shit low-key sucks. I can't really tell them what to do with their assets because it's not my place. ",1,1729637670.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I didn’t take school seriously growing up, and as a result, I didn’t graduate on time with my peers. After high school, I worked full-time at a local coffee shop and spent a year pursuing my dream of becoming a professional soccer player. I even made it to a U-21 team as a goalkeeper. But during that time, I realized many of my teammates had scholarships to universities in the U.S., and that pushed me to reconsider my path.

Motivated by this, I decided to return to school as an adult. I took one course at a time, focusing on science and math to keep my options open for university. I didn’t have a clear passion or calling, so I aimed to give myself the broadest range of choices. I eventually graduated with a 95.5% average and chose civil engineering, primarily for job security. I didn’t feel confident enough to go into tech-heavy fields like electrical or computer engineering back then.

I went on to graduate from what I believe is the best engineering school in Canada, with a 3.7 GPA. Over time, I honed my interests within civil engineering and decided to pursue geotechnical engineering. After graduating, I moved across the country to work as a consultant in tailings management. However, after a year, I started to feel lonely and decided to move back home.

Fortunately, around the same time, I was recruited by a geotechnical software company, where I now work as an application engineer. I was recently promoted to support team lead, thanks to my customer service and leadership skills. While I’ve gained a lot of experience in both engineering and software development, I’ve started feeling burnt out and disconnected from my career.

The truth is, I don’t have a deep passion for soil and rock engineering, and I’m finding it harder to justify the liability that comes with being an engineer, especially for the level of pay, which typically maxes out around $130-150K CAD in my field. While the pay is decent, I don’t see many growth opportunities, and I feel like I’m spending my life doing something I don’t truly enjoy.

I do, however, have strong analytical and communication skills and enjoy mentoring and teaching others. I’ve been told that combining an engineering degree with an MBA can be powerful, but I’m hesitant to commit two years and significant debt without a clear direction. I’ve considered transitioning into roles like product management, especially given my experience in a software company, or perhaps more general consulting. But at this point, I’m uncertain about my next move.

Not Until It Was Too Late,"Im only 18, but I already feel like I’ve lived through a lifetime’s worth of emptiness. I thought I knew what love was supposed to feel like, but my home was always cold. My mom never once turned to me and said, “I love you,” and my dad’s been out of the picture since I was six. For years, I tried to convince myself it was normal, that maybe she just wasn’t the affectionate type, but it started to eat away at me. Every time I saw my friends with their families, laughing and hugging, I felt this gaping hole in my chest.

Over the last year, things got worse. Mom and I barely spoke, and when we did, it was like talking to a wall. She had this way of making me feel small, even when she wasn’t saying anything hurtful. The silence was louder than anything she could’ve said. It was suffocating, and I was drowning.

That’s when I did something I never thought I’d do. I hired a male sex worker. I was so desperate to feel close to someone, to feel wanted, that I didn’t care how I got it. I wasn’t looking for sex, though. I just wanted someone to hold me, to make me feel like I wasn’t completely alone. So, I saved up what little money I had from my part-time job at the gym  and contacted him. His name was Ricardo.

The first time we met, it was awkward. I’d never done anything like this, and I think he could tell. But he was kind, patient. He didn’t make me feel weird for asking to just sit with him, for asking him to hold me. It was nice, but it wasn’t enough. It still felt… empty.

By the third time, I decided to try something different. I brought a stack of flashcards with me, each one with a phrase I’d never heard in my own home. “You make me feel safe.” “You’re important to me.” “I love you.” I felt ridiculous, but Ricardo just smiled and went along with it. He read them back to me, his deep voice , and for the first time in what felt like forever, I felt… okay. Like maybe I wasn’t completely invisible.

We started meeting more often. It was like a drug. I’d count down the days until I could see him again, just to hear those words. I didn’t care if they were just phrases on a card, or if he was only saying them because I paid him. They made me feel alive.

But then, things started to change. Father was acting different. He started noticing me more, like actually noticing me. He would make comments about my clothes, ask where I was going. I even caught him staring at me once, with this strange look on his face that made me uncomfortable. The weirdest part was, he stopped being so harsh. It was like she was pretending to be nice, but I didn’t trust it.

One night, I went to meet Ricardo at the motel, like usual. But when the door opened, I froze. He was wearing this blue suit, the kind of suit my father would wear, the same style, the same way it fit. His hair was even done like my fathers, loose waves that she usually wore when she was trying to look more put together. My heart started pounding, and I could barely get the words out.

“Why… why are you dressed like this?” I stammered.

Ricardo  smiled, but it wasn’t his smile. It was like she was mimicking someone else. “I thought you’d like it. Don’t you remember? he used to wear this when she took you to school.”

A chill ran down my spine. “How do you know that?”

he didn’t answer. Instead, he just walked closer, whispering, “You make me feel safe.” The words from the flashcard, the same words I’d been craving to hear, but now they felt twisted, wrong. I backed away, and without thinking, I ran out of the room.

I couldn’t sleep that night. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to make sense of it. I kept telling myself it was just a coincidence, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. I decided I wasn’t going to see Ricardo anymore. It was too weird, and I needed to focus on getting through my last year of high school without falling apart.

The next evening, I was in my room, trying to study, when I heard it. A whisper, right next to my ear, so soft I almost didn’t catch it. “You make me feel safe.” I shot up, my heart hammering, but there was no one there. Just the dark, empty room.

I tried to convince myself I was imagining things, that I was just tired, but I knew better. The next day, I went back to the motel, needing answers, even though every part of me was screaming not to. When I got there, Ricardo was already outside, waiting. But he looked different. he didn’t just look like my father; he was acting like him, too. Cold, distant. It felt like I was looking at a shadow of someone I knew.

“You couldn’t stay away, could you?” he said, his voice dripping with something dark, something that made my skin crawl.

“Ricardo, what’s going on?” I whispered. “Why are you doing this?”

he laughed, a low, bitter sound that echoed in my chest. “Ricardo? Is that what you think my name is?” he stepped closer, his smile widening. “You pathetic little girl. You actually thought this was real?”

The words hit me like a slap. “Stop it,” I said, my voice shaking. But he just kept going, cutting deeper, until I couldn’t take it anymore. I shoved him, and he stumbled back, hitting the coffee table. There was a loud crack, and then… silence.

I rushed over, panicking, but when I looked down, my heart stopped. It wasn’t Ricardo lying there. It was a mannequin, its glassy eyes staring up at me, limbs twisted in unnatural angles. Pinned to its chest were the flashcards I’d given him. “You make me feel safe.” “I love you.” “You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”

I stumbled back, my hands shaking, but then I saw something else—something new. One of the cards had different handwriting, sharper, deliberate. “Smile. I’m watching you. Your loving Father.”

I felt sick, but then I noticed them—the tiny red lights, blinking in the corners of the room. Cameras, hidden all around. he’d been watching. My father had seen everything. Every desperate encounter, every time I’d begged to feel wanted.

I couldn’t stay there. I ran, drove straight to my fathers’s work, not even sure what I was going to say, just knowing I needed to confront him. When I barged into his office, he was sitting there, calm, as if he’d been waiting for me.

“Welcome, sweetheart,” he said, his voice eerily calm. “I was hoping you’d come.”

“What is this?” I demanded, my voice cracking. “What have you done?”

he smiled, leaning back in his chair. “This, my dear, is my research. A study in dependency, control, and the fragile female ego. And you… you were my perfect subject.”

I felt the ground crumble beneath me. “You… you did this? All of it?”

“Of course,” he said, his eyes cold. “Every word, every flashcard. I needed to see how far I could push you, how much you’d crave something I never gave you. And you didn’t disappoint.”

I could barely breathe. he hadn’t been my father. he’d been my tormentor, my manipulator, and I’d walked right into his trap.

“You’re sick,” I whispered, tears stinging my eyes. But he just tilted his head, like he was studying me.

“No, sweetheart,” he said, his voice soft, but without any warmth. “I’m just thorough.”",0,1729637416.0,nosleep,3,0.5,False
