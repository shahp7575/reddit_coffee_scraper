some things that have occurred that I love him for are:

-he lets me abduct him for drives randomly 
-he loves it when I sing and listening to the music I write 
-his reaction to me rubbing CBD lotion I bought on pretty much all of him because he hurt.
-we go to an arcade by us and he gave me a lot of his tickets he's been saving up to get a plushie called a ""Catpawchino"" (it's a cat in a coffee cup and it's SO CUTE) on our last trip.
-he gets me ice water all the time because I don't want to go into the gas station.
-I'm autistic and he comments all the time on how cute my happy stims are. 
-we play fight 
-he just spent $20 - $30 on a claw machine while working at Denny's to get me a cat banana plushie and it's fucking adorable. 

(there's a lot more but there's too many to write😅)

we've struggled too with housing, his probation, mental health, and our latest poly situationship. 

he said ""fuck ups only become fallout when you've already given up"" at the beginning of our relationship and it's proven to be more true than anything. a lot of what we've gone through could've broken us apart but everything is better than ever. 

I'm 17 weeks pregnant after I thought I was infertile and were both terrified but excited for this baby. He's wanted to be a father for so long and I'm so happy I can give him that. 

so if you're struggling, just remember the good that has happened and if it's right, you'll get through it.

WHY,"In early August I met one guy on Tinder and we ended up talking a few days and eventually met up mid August.  We both agreed early on we were not looking for a relationship.  We were hooking up and even in late August I continued to scroll the dating apps, and I saw him change his Tinder bio while he was on vacation at the end of august. At this point, none of this phased me at all. 

As an aside, he works like four jobs and financially is stretched pretty thin.  He still pays the mortgage on the house he used to share with his ex gf so his kids get to stay there, pays for his own apartment, has the title on and pays the car payment on the car his ex drives, and pays most of the bills.  The ex insists on homeschooling the kids, only works part time.  He is financially stretched thin despite making good money, but it's the decision he made about how to support the kids and assuage the guilt he had about leaving that relationship 3 years ago. Worrying about the working and financials was a constant for him. I admire his efforts to step up for his kids, and make my own money and support my own kids and so his financial situation doesn't matter to me.  I do like that he works hard, takes responsibility and has strong principles about his kids and making sure their lives are orderly.

He dated one woman for a year, and they broke up a year ago.  Their lives with the lady's four kids and his two became integrated - i think pretty fast, and he said that this ex was clingy and overbearing with his time, but they also got along well. He said she wanted them to move in together after a year, and his son didn't want that, so he told her let's revisit in a year. She also wanted to have more kids. He said that she didn't want to wait longer, and didn't like his reluctance to have more kids, and they broke up in June 2024.  She met a new guy in two weeks, and then married him a few months later. That was hard on him apparently.

Back to us - we ended up talking every day.  He initiated most convos.  We had a pretty steady routine.  We both have kids and super busy schedules and would make an effort to hang out once a week, whether it was more of a date night/sex or getting lunch or coffee during the work day. By late Sept. I was getting a little uneasy with the fact that I sincerely stated at first that I wasn't looking for a relationship.  I didn't really want a relationship yet, but i also felt like maybe there was something there with him, and I was very surprised to feel this way.  I was toying with whether to say anything, and felt I should probably be honest with myself about all this asap.  But then he brought it up first - he tells me, ""by the way, I know I said that I didn't want a relationship at first.  I don't know where this is going but I feel like i am maybe feeling differently...""  I told him that's okay - it sounds like we are on the same page, and I am in no hurry at all, so let's just continue to see where this goes. 

Things continued on pretty well and we still talked a little every day, saw each other, were getting to know each other and things were good. I realized last week that I would feel a whole lot differently now than the August version of myself - if I saw him on Tinder on vacation, or if he openly reminded me he doesn't care if i am dating other people. I am the kind that feels like people aren't truly exclusive unless and until they openly agree to it, so I realized I did want to talk to him about that. 

I texted him Thursday night and said I liked him, and was getting worried about getting hurt, so I wanted to talk about something, but immediately thereafter I remembered that was a day he worked like 18 hours straight.  I said you know what, you have been up way too long, let's talk later.  he said i can talk about whatever I want with him any time.  I said no that's okay, too heavy for late at night on no sleep it can wait.  he said okay let's talk tomorrow.

Friday came and i figured we'd probably talk later that evening after he came home from an outing with his kids. But Friday morning while he was at work he texts me - ""back to the serious convo - I like you also, I also don't want to hurt you. Things I am scared of - my lack of time, I am not sure I want to be a step dad again. I am not sure I can give that energy.  Not saying we get there but if we did.  I am just being honest.  I def like you.  I just want to be straight forward.""

I dont know why he flew ahead to this topic?  My schedule is as restrictive as his because I have my kids full time and work full time, but i also am financially well off and able to support my kids and provide care to them.  I have been super supportive of his busy schedule and working around it and it's not much different than mine in that regard. And i never acted like I expect him to take over as a dad for my kids, and honestly felt a little violated that he sort of declined to come to a party he was never invited to, so to speak. 

Did he think I honestly was like, ready to take over his life?!? This was insane. I told him i was nowhere near thinking about that,, but can we discuss all this when we hang out Sunday?  He said okay.  By Sunday night I was so frazzled about his approach I honestly never got to what I wanted to talk about.  I was so freaked out by his flying ahead on telling me he doesnt want to be my kids' stepdad.  I mean i dont know if i want to be any kids stepmom, but like, I want to get to know this guy for a year or two IF things go well, and maybe then we can think about that???  It really put me off and upset me he kind of hijacked my discussion topic. By monday morning I told him that I needed some space. I am really upset because while I too dont want to be anyones stepmom, i am wiling to shelve the conclusion to that for a long time until i get to know him better. Somehow he managed to make me feel super rejected over a topic i wasnt even asking for.

Yesterday, for example, I tried approaching this damsel in distress who was reading in public

Her legs were crossed studiously. She had a book in her left hand and a steaming cup of coffee in her right. Wind combed her hair back. Her dress swirled around her bulbous figure. She looked approachable. Everyone who reads in public wants to get interrupted.

So I sprinted at her while screaming “Hey there! I’m Greg! What’s your name?! What’re your favorite hobbies? Besides reading, of course, because I can see with my own two eyes that you clearly enjoy reading, haha. Also, do you play Pokemon and Roblox? I love those games, and we’d get along fine if you liked them as well. Everyone calls me a creep for being a 40 year old man and playing those kid games. But I’m not. I promise!”

The damsel screamed! Can you believe that! Screamed! She then pepper sprayed me and called the police.

Now I’m in jail. I’m typing this story on a smuggled phone that smells faintly of a male’s anal canal.

I tried making friends with my roommate just now, but he screamed and punched me.

I have a black eye. My nose is sideways and is bleeding.

I've been working on a browser-based idle RPG called **Folkhart** that's perfect for having open in a tab while you work or study. It's basically my ""I need something relaxing running in the background"" project that turned into an actual game lol.

**What makes it cozy:**

* Runs in your browser, no download needed
* Idle dungeon runs - set it and forget it while you do other stuff
* Cute pixel art aesthetic
* Guild system to hang out with other players
* No pressure gameplay - energy regenerates over time so you can play at your own pace
* Server chat to vibe with the community

It's got that classic RPG feel (classes, equipment, leveling up) but without the stress. I literally made it because I wanted something I could check on between meetings without feeling like I'm falling behind.

**Current state:** It's playable but definitely still in development. There are bugs (I know, I know), and I'm actively adding new content. That's where you come in!

I'm looking for some patient souls who'd be willing to test it out and give feedback. If you're the type who enjoys watching numbers go up while sipping coffee, this might be your jam, maybe you can join me and we can be a team! I'm a solo-dev on this project!

Fair warning: it's a passion project, so expect some rough edges. But if you're interested in helping shape a cozy game and don't mind the occasional ""wait, that's not supposed to happen"" moment, I'd love to have you!

drop a comment or DM me if you want to check it out. No commitment required - play as much or as little as you want!",2,1761785505.0,cozygames,1,1.0,False

He has the habiloty of breaking the 4th. And uses this to his advantage, especially doing transitions in the middle of the episode. He's aware he is the main character

Pamela Cat - She's a very inteligent and soft cat, who enjoys a moment alone. She's childhood friend with Lenny, and is in love with him. She wants to tell him, but he never noticed Pamela's crush on him. But he seems to feel the same.
Pamela love cookies and coffee, and enjoys reading detective books


Lucy Skulls - laid back and relaxed dog, kinda explosive sometimes. She loves eating marshmellows, and her relationship with Lenny is like a siblings relationship. She follows Lenny everywhere he goes and he does the same with her. She has a supernatural strenght, being able to lift Lenny and Pam with only one hand.

Basically my canines are forward it's supposed to straighten towards the first molars with the aligners. In short, I have to wear my aligners for 22 hours and 24 hours, basically only taking them off to eat. Except that: 
I drink coffee in the morning otherwise I don't get up, I smoke, have a lot of evenings/aperitifs and I eat between meals.
I saw a lot of posts where you ate with it? How do you do it? I tried to eat with (flan) and I never succeeded 😭

1ojlutm,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortguys/comments/1ojlutm/how_i_accidentally_found_a_girl_who_doesnt_care/,How I accidentally found a girl who doesn’t care,"This is going to be a long read but I wanted to share it.

A bit of background on me, I’m 26 and 5’5”, around 120 lbs wet.  Shy and awkward throughout my teenage years and into my 20s.  Not a good combination but it is what it is.

Though I would not say I’ve been entirely shunned by women throughout my life I’ve been rejected by every girl I’ve ever shown interest in, generally for reasons related to the topic of the sub.

As such I reached a point maybe a year ago where I decided to just bite the bullet, basically gave up on trying and figured I’d just make my peace living as some sort of hermit.

Then back in February I walked into the coffee shop I’ve been a regular at for years and there was a new girl behind the counter.  Cute but out of my (nonexistent) league- 5’9” pale and slim with red hair, freckles and amber eyes.  

By some stroke of fate I was wearing a T-Shirt from one of my favorite bands who I had seen live back in 2023.  As it turns out this was also her favorite band and she was quick to compliment it, all smiles and excitement.  I was happy to talk about it but I work in the service industry too and don’t think much of bar conversation.  Turns out she had been at the same show so I bragged that I had actually seen them twice only to discover she had followed them on tour and actually met the band.  I don’t mind being one-upped and all of a sudden the conversation was genuine.  I got my coffee and left smiling.

I was already a regular at this shop and luckily for me she is a workaholic (following a band from city to city isn’t cheap).  So for the months after I kept going in and almost every time she was there.  Ever so slowly our passing conversations got longer, her almost aggressively extroverted personality meshed well with my more withdrawn demeanor- I spent a lot of time listening and making bad jokes in between.  

But I was still a skeptic, after all it wasn’t like this was anything new, yet I fell into it all the same.  Before I knew what was happening I was spending more and more time there, sitting at the coffee bar on days off for hours at a time and deluding myself into thinking it was idle platonic conversation.  But the topics got deeper, more personal, we’d both lost parents young and struggled with depression and having no idea of our place in the world.  By the time I realized I had a massive irredeemable crush on her it was already too late.  Oh well, what’s one more right?

Then she started mentioning other regulars who had come in, more than a few who had asked for her number (because she’s gorgeous)- one such interaction I had personally seen but all to the same result: she wasn’t interested.  Now I was overthinking like I always do, why would she mention that to me?  A warning not to do the same or a subtle hint to give it a try?  All these men were far taller and way better looking I figured.  In the end I didn’t push it, I resolved to bottle my feelings up and move on without jeopardizing my free coffee plug (because at this point I hadn’t paid for a latte in months).  The cowards way out but better than rejection.

I wound up asking for her instagram a few days later anyhow, not with any intention of sliding but just because at this point I figured we were friends.  But then she started DMing me instead, the classic meme exchange stage had begun- but more than that she was now checking in on mornings to see if I’d be visiting her at work.  Even my willfully illiterate pessimism couldn’t ignore the massive neon blinking signals I seemed to be getting.

I had to do something I realized, so one rare day when she wasn’t working I did the only thing I could think to do.  I asked her if she wanted to get coffee with me instead of giving it.  Luckily she lived just a few neighborhoods over from my house and all of a sudden was at my door and we were on a date.  It went well, even though at this point it felt like something we’d done a thousand times.  We hugged goodbye and she said she’d see me tomorrow.  For the first time in years I had hope.

A few days later she texted me to come in, her best friend was visiting and she wanted her to meet me.  Of course I went, I’d heard a bit about this girl already and in all honestly was going to be there anyways.  Like me this girl was a bit more introverted but pleasant enough, we talked about music and I thought nothing more of it.

But then out of nowhere the texts stopped coming and suddenly the conversation seemed to dry up.  I still went in but something felt off.  I had to know why but didn’t know how to broach it.  So I decided to take the direct route and simply asked.

She knew I liked her, obviously, but she said it would never work and that we’d be better off as friends.  Tried to sugarcoat it, saying that I was a regular and it would be awkward, and that our five year age gap was too much.  I wasn’t going to argue but she knew me well enough by then to realize I didn’t believe her, so she said it: you’re just too short.

Ouch, there it was.  That familiar sinking feeling, the bitterness welling up again for the upteenth time.  I remember chuckling, said I had heard that before.  She asked me to wait but I didn’t listen, walking out to my car for what I resolved would be the last time I ever set foot in that place.

I spent the entirety of the next day moping around the house and kicking myself for being such an unrepentant dumbass.  Went out drinking with friends the night after in a somber mood but believing when all else fails there’s always alcohol.  They asked how things were going, I didn’t talk about her.

But then for once in my life the story changed.  I worked the next day hungover and got home late, had just sat down when I got the text.

“Are you home?”

What could it possibly be now?  I hadn’t seen or spoken to her since I left the coffee shop that last day.  Didn’t even want to think about her despite my brain refusing to comply and now she’s asking if I’m home.  I stared at the message for a minute and figured it was harmless.

“Yeah, why?”

“I’m outside.”

This would be the cruelest joke of all time I remember thinking as I walked to the door.  But I opened it and there she was with a coffee in her hand.  Said she hadn’t seen me and thought I might have needed some.  I could only describe what I felt in that moment as some kind of disbelief.  I stared for a long moment with no idea how to respond, by the time I came back to reality there were silent tears streaming down her face.

“I’m sorry, please can I come in?”

I couldn’t say no, despite myself I still cared.  We sat in my room and she explained while I drank the coffee.  As it turned out after meeting me her best friend and by extension friend group had done a complete 180 on me.  Whereas before I was such a sweet caring option now that they knew how short I was I had been reduced to some kind of creep.  I listened barely believing what I was hearing while also vaguely aware of how validating it was to hear such shallow reasoning spoken out loud.  Not my fault echoing around in my head the entire time.

I nodded along with the latte in my hand like I had done a thousand times with her before, and then she said it.

“But these past three days I’ve missed you so much, and I don’t care what any of them think- I like you a lot and I’m so sorry I ever doubted it.”

Oh shit.  Alarm bells.  What now?

It might have been the leftover alcohol in my system, or maybe the caffeine, but the only thing I could think to do was kiss her.  So I did, and then kept doing so until we were in my bed.

It wound up being perhaps the best night of my life, and when I woke up the next morning I was shocked to see she was still there next to me.

We made it official a couple days later and have been dating now for three months.  At times I still can’t believe it but it’s true.  I used to read stories like this and scoff but there’s always a chance and it’s never too late.

In short: don’t give up, embrace a caffeine addiction, and find a girl who can think for herself.",0,1761785053.0,shortguys,2,0.33,False

An update on my semi-budget kitchen and living room refurb.,"A while ago I wrote a post about my budget Ikea kitchen, and later about the living. room. The first one had quite a few comments from people asking to post an update once it's finished. The second one was mostly people making fun of my new dance floor in the living room. So I thought I'd post an update. It's a 1905 house that's not been refurbished since the 80s.

Appliances (oven, hob, extractor fan, dishwasher): £1000

Pine timber panels: £400

Chandeliers, wall and table lamps: £600

Marble floor tiles: £800

Engineered wood floor: £1000



Next I'm planning on fitting a few brass wall picture lights in the living room, a coffee table, two large armchairs, and a vintage bench and dining table in the kitchen.

Not sure what to do with the panels on the kitchen. There are two options on the table: beige/sage paint or Osmo wax oil in a slightly darker tint to match the cabinets.",6,1761784926.0,DIYUK,1,1.0,False

1ojlsaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1ojlsaf/need_solid_advice_from_smart_operators_on_how_to/,Need solid advice from smart operators on how to navigate Toxic Boss.,"I work in the operations division of a mid-sized medical/tech company, and my boss is one of the most controlling and toxic people I’ve ever worked for. She swings between acting like a kind, purpose-driven leader and exploding over the smallest administrative mistake. She’s accused team members of “betraying her trust” for things as minor as a mislabeled document, a typo in a text, or missing data in Excel.

She monitors everything: our Outlook calendars, Teams activity, and even document revision histories in SharePoint. We’re required to text her when we arrive at the office, when we start our next task, when we take lunch, when we leave for the day, and when we get home at night. If we don’t respond to a message within seconds, she’ll call or email repeatedly, sometimes three or four times in a row until we pick up.

The other day, she forgot her coffee mug and blamed it on me!

She also makes each of us submit a detailed daily schedule broken down into 30-minute increments. She watches that schedule like a hawk, and if we don’t text on time, there’s hell to pay. Any deviation from the schedule, even three minutes, can trigger a lecture about our commitment to the company.

On top of that, she requires us to work one to two hours after we get home from work and two to three hours every weekend on separate tasks.

When she’s angry, she’ll say things like, “I’m re-evaluating who belongs on this team.” Then, a couple of days later, she’s sending cheerful messages about how “lucky” she is to have us.

She’s also banned me from meeting with colleagues in other departments or talking to others in the industry, even outside work hours.... which I’m pretty sure is illegal in California.

The most unsettling part is that she never documents anything negative in writing: no emails, no HR trails. Only phone calls, texts, or closed-door meetings. It feels calculated, like she doesn’t want any record of her behavior.

The anxiety on our team is through the roof. Many of us are working ourselves to exhaustion just to avoid being targeted, but it’s never enough. For anyone who’s navigated toxic leadership in the corporate world, how do I get out safely and protect my professional reputation in the process?

Do I just start networking regardless?

1ojlqza,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ojlqza,Amy’s Diary — Wednesday: Haunted Prep & Mountain Surprise!,"Dear Diary,
After school today, the whole campus felt like a Halloween construction zone! 🎃👻

Our teacher, Mrs. Wallace, finally announced the official plan — each class would build their own Spooky Booth for Friday’s charity event. The proceeds would go to the local animal shelter (which made Bridget from the next class almost cry with happiness).

Our class voted fast — we’re making a “Haunted Forest Trail” with cardboard trees, glow-in-the-dark eyes, and fake fog!
Kira immediately volunteered to be in charge of lighting, Penny said she’d handle the creepy background music, and I got assigned to decorations with Winfrey.
“I’ll bring candles and books to make it mystical,” Winfrey said, because of course she would — the novel lover of our group.

By the end of the meeting, we were all covered in glitter, fake cobwebs, and maybe a bit of glue. But we didn’t care — the excitement for Friday was real.


---

After cleanup, we stopped by Coffee Day again to drop off some extra paper lanterns for Zoe’s charity booth. Everyone was busy — Ayaka was painting pumpkin faces on paper cups, and Mr. Tanaka was testing the sound system with calm perfection.
“Everything must be ready before Friday,” Zoe smiled. “We’re counting on Sunnyville’s energy!”

As we were sipping our smoothies, Carmen suddenly gasped, showing her phone.
“Look, everyone! Michelle McBain just posted new photos!”

We all crowded around her screen — and there she was, Michelle, standing high up in the mountains! 🌄 She was smiling brightly under the morning sun, her backpack strapped tight, surrounded by endless peaks. The caption read:

> “Morning hike before the Halloween madness begins! Fresh air, clear mind, and spooky stories waiting to be told this Friday. #TruthOrScare #AdventureAndMystery”



Penny blinked. “Wait, she’s hiking? Today?”
“Yup!” said Winfrey. “Even spooky hosts need exercise.”

I laughed and said, “She’s probably collecting mountain ghost stories next!”
That made everyone giggle.

Then Zoe came over, curious. “Oh, Michelle McBain? She’s quite the storyteller. Her show’s going to make Sunnyville proud.”
That made me smile — because now it really feels like everyone in this town is connected somehow.

Before leaving, we all promised Zoe we’d help early Friday morning to set up.
As we walked home, the sky was pink and gold, and all I could think was —
Halloween’s almost here. Michelle’s hiking, Zoe’s brewing smoothies, and we’re building a haunted forest.

It’s going to be amazing.

Let me know if you're going to the UK and would like to exchange cash, I can offer the same rate as you have on Google.

The rate in the only 2 conversion exchanges in Seattle is the lowest I have ever seen during travel, so not really into losing 50-100$+ on exchange.

Looked at Marker.io. Saw the $59/mo price tag. Thought ""I'm a developer, how hard could this be?""

**The actual origin story:** I'm too cheap to pay $59/mo for feedback software, so I built my own instead. The math doesn't math, but here we are.

**What it does:** Screenshot annotations, priority tagging, shareable boards. You know, the thing I could've just paid for and been done in 5 minutes.

**Why you should roast me:**

* I reinvented the wheel to save $59/month, then spent way more than $59/month reinventing the wheel
* My business plan is ""surely OTHER people are also too cheap""
* I'm now competing with the tool I was too broke to afford
* Peak indie maker energy: ""I'll just build it myself"" *regret intensifies*

**The irony:**

* Spent more on coffee during development than a year of Marker.io would cost
* Still don't have half the features Marker.io has
* Somehow convinced myself this was the ""smart"" choice

**Real talk:** Is ""made by a cheapskate for cheapskates"" a viable market position?

I’ve been drinking one energy drink every morning for about 15 years. Also some cola and 1 coffee a day.

I deal with migraines, anxiety, and fatigue, and my psychologist believes this daily energy drink might be a big trigger and the main thing I should try to quit.

Honestly, I’m nervous about stopping. It’s been part of my routine for so long that I can’t imagine my mornings without it. I’ve also heard that even small daily caffeine habits can cause withdrawal symptoms like headaches, mood swings, and exhaustion. My worst fear is that I will feel too bad to function at my job because of the withdrawal.

For those who quit a similar small but long-term caffeine habit:
	•	How did you go about it — cold turkey or gradual reduction?
	•	How bad were the withdrawal symptoms, and how long did they last?
	•	Did you notice improvement in energy, headaches, or mood afterward (or something else)?

Any tips or personal stories would really help. I want to do this the right way, but I don’t want to feel miserable for weeks either.

I have had the same findom for about 2 years and haven’t sent to anyone else, I would like to say we became friends during this time. A few weeks ago I told this domme I was leaving to focus on my vanilla life as my mental health is at an all time low due to losing my job and the thought of losing my family and home. I’m on antidepressants as well which was messing with my moods. 

I will miss the friendship but findom wasn’t good for me anymore and it was becoming hard to talk to her on twitter and just remain friends. We had met up once or twice for coffee and went for a drive around the countryside but nothing more, it was very platonic. We lived local enough to each other but not in the same town so there is a chance I can bump into her but rare. Our relationship was mainly online but we did FaceTime and have a few video calls.

We have both shared intimate information and I have sent a few photos of me doing stupid things, like CEI & CBT and some sissy stuff but I have never consented to stuff like exposure, blackmail or anything CNC. 

As I have left, does that remove all consent?

I've been constantly looking at people's highs and lows on here when buying a property and it's helped me and my fiance understand what goes on, from viewing to completing.

We have both been private renting for 4 years and we have been blessed with 2 excellent landlords (Two different properties) which have allowed us to have our 2 house cats, both in that time have not moved our rent one penny since moving in.

So let's get into the dates:

Start of July met with a mortgage advisor who sorted my friends mortgage out. Absolute gentleman went through everything, no cost got paid by the mortgage provider. Two clueless 30 year olds went through the whole process with us both and let us know how much we could borrow. £10k deposit, 95ltv so £200k was our max. £3k put away for solicitors and survey.

started viewing properties, the original one we wanted to see roof burnt down 5 days before we were suppose to view. (Blessings in disguise). Estate agent set us up to view 2 properties around the corner from the original. 

First property owned by an older couple who wanted to downsize. Lovely 3 bed house but needed alot of work, massive garden but both of us have no interest in a big garden just not for us.

Second house my fiance was sold instantly. 3 bed Victorian house, extension on the back, summerhouse. No chain house has been newly decorated. Sellers were selling because it was a family members who passed away.We went and discussed both over a coffee and she was beeming. Context both houses were priced at £210k.

Submitted a low ball offer of £195k the next day.

Rejected which we were expecting, we sat on it for a week and went up to £200k. They accepted the next day August 11th.

Solicitors actioned the next day and survey booked in. We spoke to the EA about going to look at it again, the house was empty but felt like I needed to look at it all again.

Genuinely the next few months seemed to fly by, solicitors CC us into all the emails which was interesting to see all the waffle they send back and forth. Made sure to stay on top on the paperwork and emails. Sent everything back the next day we received stuff. 

Fastforward to a few days ago we exchanged on the house and will be getting the keys in less than 2 weeks, our choice because we want to give our landlord the months notice and gives us time to pack and sort out the moving day. Also gives us time to sort out our rental place.

I feel like we got extremely lucky with this as nothing has been stressful but I guess the sellers were keen to do it quickly and both solicitors knew what they were doing.

Bonus is we complete on my birthday 🥳

I’m a 36-year-old nerd from New England who lives for conventions, gaming, and cosplay. Fun fact: I even made my own dating site—and it actually got featured on the news.

Cosplay has given me a great community, whether I’m rocking Eddie Munson from Stranger Things or Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and I have an odd talent for winning raffles and sweepstakes (seriously, it happens way too often).

Now for the real talk: I’ve never been in a relationship before. Not because I didn’t want to, but because of shyness, timing, and life just not lining up. I’ve grown a lot, though, and I’m ready for something genuine. If you’re kind, nerdy (or at least nerd-friendly), and believe in connection over perfection, I think we could click.

Cosplay isn’t required—what matters is having fun, sharing laughs, and seeing where things go. If you’re nearby, I’d love to start with something simple, like grabbing a coffee.

The novel is finished and I am considering possible edits before querying. The novel is about an infertile couple who use a faith healer to conceive, but things obviously don't go to plan with supernatural forces unleashed by the ritual.

PROLOGUE

The old woman moved around the younger woman like a withered wraith in the mist of smoke. She seemed lost in the strange words she recited, like a child hoping to memorize something before an exam.

On the floor Hazel breathed in the heady scent of incense. Her flesh had become numb to the cold tiles which had bristled against her naked back and buttocks when she first lay down an hour ago. She was within a circle of cracked egg shells the faith healer had scattered about, one of several eccentricities the ritual apparently demanded.

Her eyes were closed against the stinging smoke and Constance’s pale stake of naked flesh. The smoke and words tendrilled into her consciousness. Hazel felt herself billow along on the rumble of Constance's words, a ceaseless deep gurgling torrent punctuated by shrill peaks that emerged from the flow seamlessly without interrupting it. It almost seemed as if two voices were harmonizing from different ends of the spectrum.

She concentrated on the flow, latched onto a motif and followed it as it repeated, becoming both itself and its memory in a hypnotic cycle, slowly morphing over time to a new pattern borne on the guttural stream.  

Suddenly the chanting stopped. The silence that followed was stark as a precipice.  

Hazel flinched as an ice-cold hand pressed against her stomach. Her eyes shot open. Constance was hunkered down over her, legs either side, pressing the palm of her hand deep into the flesh above the groin. The old woman’s eyes were open, revealing only the whites. The unseeing cragged face was curtained by long strands of grey frizz, her small breasts sagged into flat triangles.

Hazel shuttered the sight with her eyelids. Constance’s chanting grew faster, louder, till it turned into grunting. It was like she was evacuating something from within herself.

Hazel drew in rapid breaths; the smoke trickled against the back of her throat. Her heart beat faster, harmonizing to the rhythm of Constance’s cacophony.

The grunting stopped and Hazel heard the phlegmy clearing of mucous, the gargling of spittle. The sound of spitting, and a wet sensation around her vagina. Dapples of damp down her thighs.

*What is this?* Hazel thought in a wave of shock.

Constance pressed her hand deeper into Hazel’s stomach, massaging it, kneading it. Hazel felt a pin prick of pain inside her, followed by an electric tingle emanating from that spot that travelled through her body. Her body was suffused with a warm hazy glow.

Constance started up chanting again. Loud and almost like a growl. The old woman’s black labrador Pooka howled from outside as if in chorus with her.

Constance withdrew her hand. Hazel heard her tread around her a few more times, the growl relenting and softening until it fell back into a chant. It became softer and lower still till it receded to a faint whisper, drowned by the dog’s barking, till the dog too stopped as if part of the performance.

Hazel heard the flick of the light switch, the door opening. 

Then Constance’s voice: “You can get dressed.”

Hazel got up after she heard the door closed. She examined the room around her. The cracked egg shells around the chalk circle. The candle flames still flickering, dried wax guttered down their sides. The silver incense burner smouldering the last bits. She felt chilled all of a sudden, like the cold she should have felt over the last however long it was had been stored up to be released all at once. 

She shivered, dressed quickly and went outside. Constance was back in her tatty old jeans and jumper, sipping tea on the couch. There was a steaming cup prepared for Hazel on the coffee table too. Hazel sat down, cupped it between her hands, felt the warm ceramic on her hands and sipped the warmth inside. She slowly felt herself coming back to her normal senses.

“It’s done now. We will wait and see,” said Constance.

They drank in silence.

After a while, Constance got up, moved to the window, drew back the curtain and peered outside. Dusk had fallen and Joachim sat in the driver's seat, face framed with spectral light as he read something on his phone.

“Shall we bring Joachim in?” Constance asked.

Hazel suddenly felt self-conscious. After what she'd been through, it would feel weird to bring him in and adopt the trappings of normality again so casually. She shook her head. Constance nodded agreeably. As if she'd passed some test.

“You two will have a lot to talk about very soon.”

She was right.

But then, as I’m sipping my iced coffee and trying to find the motivation, I realized I’d forgotten to charge my laptop. Classic Eric move, right?

After a bit of scrambling and some quick panic, I plugged it in and decided to take a quick ride to the beach. I thought, why not?

Almost wiped out but managed to keep my balance like a pro. Gotta say, my life is basically a mix of coding and extreme sports at this point.

Once I got to the beach, I set up my “office” on a plastic chair. Not ideal, but hey, it’s got a view! The WiFi is a bit spotty out there, but I thought I’d take my chances. I fired up Zoom for a meeting with my team, and let me tell you, sweating buckets in front of my screen while trying to sound professional is not the vibe. My colleagues were probably wondering why I looked like I just ran a marathon. The sound of waves crashing was my background music, though, so that was a win.

**MIKE:** “Okay Mike, just stay calm…”

He knocks on the door, and is greeted by Kathrin a few seconds later - she is wearing very casual clothing, albeit with a hockey jersey tied around her waist. As per usual, she looks absolutely stunning, and Mike is taken aback as a result.

**KAT:** “Hi Mike! So glad you didn’t leave me in the dust!”

**MIKE:** “H-hi Kat… I would never leave my… f-friends hanging!”

**KAT:** “That’s great to know! Well, come on in, make yourself at home! I’m going to get something for us to drink.”

**MIKE:** “Alright… thanks!”

With much of the initial nerves quelled, Mike walks into the apartment and takes a seat in the lounge. The television is running, showing the hockey highlights from all across the MHL from a few days ago. Mike doesn’t even watch hockey, but he knows how it is played and all of the rules.

Kathrin appears from around the corner, carrying two glasses of what appears to be a dark-coloured chilled soda. She puts the glasses down onto the coffee table before sitting down next to Mike as he eyes the drink up, having never seen anything like it before.

**MIKE:** “This looks interesting, what is it?”

**KAT:** “Pawfola!”

**MIKE:** “Never heard of that.”

**KAT:** “It’s my favourite drink! It’s from the Basitin market on Folford Row.”

**MIKE:** “Basitin market?”

**KAT:** “Yeah, Folford Row is where the few Western Basitins live. Never been there?”

**MIKE:** “Never, I grew up in Digby, right next door to my best friend.”

Kathrin listens intently, interested in hearing more about him and his life.

**KAT:** “You two seem *perfect* for each other.”

Mike’s face turns red, not entirely sure what Kathrin is implying. She simply giggles at how easily red-faced he got.

**MIKE:** “H-huh? W-what does that mean?”

**KAT:** “Hehe… oh man, you’re so cute like this…”

Now *that’s* a way to fluster the poor fox. He attempts to change the subject to avoid further embarrassment…

**MIKE:** “A-anyway! W-where are Laura and Willow?”

**KAT:** “Laura’s gone to the ballpark with her girlfriend, Willow’s in that big furniture store working, I think...”

**MIKE:** “I assume that wolf with orange fur and red hair is Laura’s girlfriend, huh?”

**KAT:** “Yep, that’s Cass. I didn’t think they’d ever gel so well - let alone get along! Love is magical, isn’t it?”

Mike’s heart flutters a little when she says that. The silence that follows is heavy, the tension in the air knots in Mike’s throat, making him unable to speak. They look away from each other awkwardly, both not even considering saying a word to break the tension.

Mike considers whether he should just straight up admit that he has feelings for her, but wouldn’t it be too direct? Considering that he’d known her for a grand total of two days, it’s probably a bit too early to admit anything now…

**MIKE:** “Uhh… so…”

He cannot even form a sentence right now anyway, there is simply no way he’d be able to ask such a tough question.

**MIKE:** “What… d-do you… uhh…”

**KAT:** “S-sorry, I-I didn’t… erm… didn’t catch that…”

**MIKE:** “Can y-you… uhh… sorry, Kat… I just…”

Mike stands up and goes to look out the window, watching the world go by. How in all hell, can a painfully average looking guy like him, even be friendly with someone as stunning as Kathrin?

It just feels like a lost cause for him. He’s almost in tears looking at the world from the confines of this apartment. It’s nearly too much.

Mike sits back down, choking up trying to hide his emotions from Kathrin, who displays her concern for him…

**KAT:** “Mike…?”

He ignores her and places his head in his hands. The stress is about to overwhelm him, he mumbles something under his breath

**MIKE:** *“I guess I’m not worth it…”*

Kathrin gently shakes Mike’s shoulder.

**KAT:** “Mike.”

**MIKE:** *“Huh…?”*

Kathrin lifts Mike up by his chin, gazing into his eyes as they meet.

**KAT:** “If I don’t confess, it will haunt me for all eternity.”

**MIKE:** “Wha—...”

Kathrin leans in and kisses Mike deeply, their eyes both closing simultaneously as a result of the passion of the moment.

In an instant, all the pressure on Mike’s shoulders about admitting to Kathrin how he felt gets washed away, diluted by the essence and taste of pure love. It’s a moment of unfiltered passion, from the lowest of lows to seein’ stars within the space of a few seconds. Something about this kiss just feels [so… **sweet.**](https://open.spotify.com/track/0ur9sjBeHE7gqTSVaAJlHJ?si=950b59cc5fe34366)

I swapped my former, smaller home office with the larger bedroom next door. I turned that room into a personal library, designed in a *Heritage Modern* style inspired by Ralph Lauren, New England homes (where I’m from), and traditional English country houses.

Nearly everything in the room was built from scratch or found in local antique shops. The original Victorian details—mantel, tile, and stained glass—had been lost in the 1970s or 80s, but I tracked down replacements: the mantel came from an antique store (with its original shipping label still on the back), while the fire grate and stained glass were sourced from Architectural Salvage here in Louisville.

The furnishings are a mix of styles and eras: a refinished 1947 U.S. Army Air Corps desk, a 1960s armchair (not a real Eames, but a real vintage knockoff), and an 1880s small steamer trunk made here in Louisville that I put casters on to make a coffee table. We did all of the woodwork ourselves, built the shelves, and put up the wainscotting. The result is a space that feels timeless, personal, and rooted in everything I love.

It would help a lot!

DISCLAIMER: (this is A WORK IN PROGRESS; I’m just a girl) 


In 1994, Katie Walters, the “mean girl” and the epitome of high-school perfection; popular, beautiful, dating the star football player, Trent Harrison, and living a seemingly idyllic life, but it still isn’t enough for her parents, is secretly dating a girl, specifically, her best friend and soccer teammate, Scarlett “Scottie” Parker, whom she is obsessed with. But  then, on Katie’s birthday, the two get attacked by the football boys, including Trent, while they are drunk and leaving a party, specifically Katie’s birthday party held by the soccer team, and they attack Scottie to a pulp while Katie runs away. 

That same night, Katie’s conservative parents let Katie know that her grandmother is in the hospital, completely disregarding the situation that just happened to Katie, and that they are visiting her right now; when Katie arrives at the hospital and sees a doctor tending to a battered Scottie, she asks the doctor if she is going to be okay; that’s when she breaks the news; Scottie is in a coma. On the drive home from the hospital, Katie is still crying and being hysterical (it still being Katie’s birthday), and her parents just don’t get it. As soon as they get home, Katie immediately gets in an argument with her parents, and Katie rushes up to her room, reads the old letters that Scottie and Katie wrote to eachother, and sobs.

In 2021, Katie is now married to Trent, and they have one daughter, who they named Scarlett, who is 16 going on 30, after Scottie. Scarlett is sharp, observant, and often cynical, using biting humor to mask her vulnerability. She is perceptive and picks up on inconsistencies in her parents' behavior. 

Scottie finally wakes up; and the first thing she does is ask if Katie ran away from the football boys, and immediately digs into Katie’s new life. Scottie arrives while Trent and Scarlett are out of town for a father-daughter trip, asking if she could stay, just for a couple weeks. Katie says yes. Scottie’s earlier sense of humor transforms into a defense mechanism in adulthood, masking pain and her reluctance to engage with the realities of her past experiences. Katie tells Scottie about Scarlett, the high school drama that happened while Scottie was out, Katie telling Scottie that she got pregnant with Scarlett right after they graduated, so her and Trent had to get married immediately after, in a courthouse, they argue, and Katie and Scottie finally kiss. Scarlett comes home, and sees them kiss. 

The next day, it’s Katie’s birthday, and the 28 year anniversary of the attack. Scottie gives Katie a birthday cake, and she says that Scarlett and Trent are at a coffee shop. Katie also says that her and Scarlett will be going homecoming dress shopping, and says that Trent will just stay at the house, if Scottie is okay with that. Scarlett snitches on Scottie and Katie to Trent while they are out on a coffee date. 

While Katie and Scarlett go dress shopping for Scarlett homecoming, Trent and Scottie get in an argument, Scottie telling Trent why can’t she be what he is to Katie, Scottie cries, which then turns into a fight and a chase, resulting in Trent stabbing Scottie. Trent then rushes out of the house, leaving Scottie on the kitchen floor to die.  

While dying, Scottie hallucinates back to that night, where instead of running, Katie saves her, and takes Scottie back to Katie’s bedroom; Katie then reveals that Scottie is dying. Scottie is in denial, saying that she wanted to finally get to express her relationship with Katie with the time she had left, Katie cries, saying that she wished she could too, but maybe in the next lifetime. Scottie says that all of this is unfair, and Katie and Scottie argue. Katie then tells Scottie to lay down in the bed, and Katie soothes Scottie to sleep. 

When Katie and Scarlett arrive, the house is a mess. Katie finds Scottie’s bloody body in the kitchen, begging her to wake up, saying that she always loved her. Scottie then dies in Katie’s arms. Scarlett then starts crying, telling Katie that she didn’t know that her dad would kill Scottie. Katie then lashes out at Scarlett. The police arrive.

1ojky3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1ojky3c/advice_for_dealing_with_intrusive_thoughts_that/,advice for dealing with intrusive thoughts that an innocent interaction was cheating?,"tldr: I'm having intrusive thoughts that hanging out with a friend was cheating and idk how to actually deal with the thoughts other than seeking reassurance which obviously isnt good, I'd love some help please. 

I went out for coffee with a male friend yesterday. He's part of an organisation I've been heavily involved with for 1 and a half years and I brought him into my team within that organisation in February. He got a job at my university so we decided to grab coffee and have a chat because he's just got back from travelling. some drama has been unfolding in the organisation so we just talked about that the whole time. He's also friends with someone else in the friend group my partner and I are in.

The whole time I couldn't stop thinking that this was basically cheating and I was a terrible partner and terrible person and I'd betrayed my soulmate etc and it's been 24 hours and it hasn't stopped.

I *know* it's not logical but that's not helping me. I mentioned that I hung out with him to my partner and they didn't care at all, obviously. However that didn't alleviate it either.

To top it all off I'm a raging lesbian so it's not even like I would ever be attracted to my friend anyway!!

So despite explaining all this to myself repeatedly and reminding myself of my partner's reaction and the fact that they've gone out for coffee with friends before I'm still dealing with the thoughts and it feels really terrible. Does anyone know how to actually deal with these thoughts in a productive way? My therapist can't treat me for it (she's bound by the insurance company I see her through because I see her for PTSD) and I can't afford to see another one so I'm on my own.

My primary language is Spanish, and I used an LLM to translate this article. I apologize if some parts read a bit AI-generated. I wanted to share this perspective with you all.

What I'm about to tell you has more twists than the ""Game of Thrones"" books. Grab some coffee because this is going to be long, and look—I'm not going to give you ""the answer"" (because honestly, I don't know what will happen). I'm going to give you data so you can draw your own conclusions.

It turns out everyone's talking about ""the AI race"" between the United States and China. Headlines everywhere: ""Who will dominate the future?"", ""The new technological Cold War"", blah blah blah.

But here's the detail almost nobody mentions, and it blows my mind: **they're not running the same race**.

It's like one is playing poker and the other is playing chess, on a muddy football field, but both are convinced they're going to win ""the match."" So you ask yourself: what the hell are they actually doing?

# The United States: Betting It All

Imagine this: The United States took all its money, sold the car, mortgaged the house, and put everything on number ""12"" on the roulette wheel. That number is called AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).

What is AGI? Basically, AI that can do everything the most capable human does, but better. The thing that, according to Elon Musk and Sam Altman, is ""only 5 years away.""

# The Data: [Where's the Plug?](https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/1oiv3b4/datacenters_everyone_talks_about_who_will_win_but/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) And Why This Is a Bubble...

**The Mechanics of the Bubble (Or How to Do Magic with Balance Sheets)**

How is all this financed? Simple: Nvidia invests in OpenAI. OpenAI uses that money to buy chips from... Nvidia.

**The Numbers Don't Lie (But CEOs Do)**

And if you think I'm exaggerating about the bubble, let me throw some numbers at you that will make you sweat:

The S&P 500 between 2023 and 2025 went crazy. But here's the shady detail: only 35-40% of that rise came from companies actually making more money. The other 60-65%? Pure smoke.

Breakdown:

* **50% of returns**: Multiple expansion (basically, people paying more and more for the same thing)
* **30-35%**: Real earnings growth (the only legitimate thing here)
* **5-8%**: Stock buybacks (companies buying their own shares to inflate the price)
* **5-8%**: Dividends

In plain English: if the market went up $100, only $35-40 came from real value. The other $60-65 is air, expectation, hype, and accounting tricks.

# The Death Zone

Want to know how crazy things are? The market is trading at a P/E of \~30x. The historical average is 16-17x.

Translation: we're paying almost double what historically makes sense. Levels only seen at the peak of the 2000 dot-com bubble.

And we all know how that movie ended.

If the market returns to its ""historical mean"" (which it eventually always does—it's math, not opinion), we're talking about a potential drop of 35-45%.

# The Magnificent 7 and Their House of Cards

And here comes the riskiest part: 7 companies (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, Tesla) are 36.6% of the S&P 500.

In 2023, these 7 grew their earnings by +29%. Sounds great, right? Until you see that the rest of the index (the other 493 companies) fell -4.8%.

The entire market is supported by 7 companies. It's like Jenga, but the top blocks are only supported by 7 pieces at the bottom—if one falls, everything comes down...

What could go wrong? The snake eating its own tail. Except this snake has market valuations higher than the GDP of entire countries.

# The Problem: The Technology Is Stuck

Remember the transformer? That architecture behind ChatGPT, GPT-4, and basically all modern LLMs. Well, it turns out Ilion Jones, one of the guys who literally invented transformers, came out publicly saying the AI field has ""calcified"" around his own creation.

His words: the success of transformers created a ""herd effect"" where everyone works on the same thing out of fear of being left behind. Nobody's looking for new architectures anymore. Everyone's obsessed with squeezing 2% more efficiency out of the same model.

**The Transformer Trap**

They can't change technology without collapsing the bubble.

Think about it: they have trillions invested in a specific architecture. Nvidia sold chips optimized for that architecture. Data centers are designed for that architecture. Entire teams are specialized in that architecture.

What if it turns out that to reach AGI you need a completely different architecture?

You have two options:

**Option A**: Admit you need to change paradigms → The bubble explodes. Valuations evaporate. Investors flee. ""You're telling me the $500 billion is useless?""

**Option B**: Keep investing in the same thing even though you know it has a ceiling → Kick the can down the road. Keep burning money. Pray it works.

Guess which one they're choosing?

It's the perfect trap: they can't admit they're on a plateau without destroying the narrative that sustains all the investment.

# China: The Boring Accountant Strategy

While Silicon Valley is having technological orgasms dreaming about AGI, China is doing something much more boring: automating factories.

Their logic is beautiful in its simplicity: ""If AGI arrives, great. If it doesn't, we're also fine because in the meantime we're building the best industry on the planet.""

# The ""Good Enough"" Philosophy

China isn't chasing the perfect robot that can write poetry and perform brain surgery. They're deploying millions of robots that can do one thing: work.

Are they the best robots in the world? No. Are they perfect? Not at all. But they cost 20% of what Western ones cost and they work well enough.

And here's the mind-blowing fact: **they're installing one out of every two industrial robots in the world**.

While the United States debates whether AGI will arrive in 2027 or 2030, China is putting robots on factory floors. Now. Today. At this very moment.

# The Hybrid Model: What Nobody Sees

But here comes the most interesting part, and it's something almost nobody in the West is understanding.

The Chinese model isn't ""communism"" or ""capitalism."" It's a pragmatic hybrid that combines the best of both worlds:

* The dynamism of the private sector (companies compete, innovate, bust their asses)
* The stability of the public sector (the State guarantees there's always work)

The real ""secret"" of the Chinese model is that the State tells private companies: ""I guarantee your factory will have orders forever.""

The result: a hyper-competitive industry that never stops growing.

# The Civil-Military Fusion

And here comes the strategic detail that the West is just starting to grasp.

In the United States, civil and military industry are separate. Shipyards that make commercial ships don't make warships. Factories that make cars don't make tanks.

In China, it's all the same thing.

The same facilities, the same engineers, the same supply chains make merchant ships and destroyers. Delivery drones and military drones. Industrial robots and combat robots.

**You know what that means in a war?**

That China's entire industrial capacity can convert to military production. They don't have to ""switch modes."" They're already in permanent hybrid mode.

A single Chinese shipyard has more capacity than all U.S. shipyards combined. And they have hundreds.

# The Virtuous Cycle

There's another advantage that's barely mentioned: Chinese AI engineers are in factories, not in labs writing papers.

They learn faster because they're testing in the real world, with real problems, in real time.

While a Google engineer needs 3-6 months to publish a paper, a Chinese engineer has already tested 50 versions of their algorithm on a real production line. Look, the United States leads in cutting-edge AI technology, but China is more practical.

It's the difference between theory and practice. And in technology, practice almost always wins.

# So, Who Wins?

And here comes the part where I have to be honest: **I have no fucking idea**.

Nobody knows. And anyone who tells you they do is either lying or selling something.

Let me paint the scenarios for you (and leave yours if you think I'm missing any):

# Scenario 1: The U.S. Wins, Reaches AGI and Rules for 100 Years

If AGI arrives in the next 5-10 years, and if the United States develops it first, and if they manage to keep it under control...

Then this bet will have been the most brilliant in history. They'd skip 50 years of industrial development in a decade. Game over.

# Scenario 2: China Wins

If AGI doesn't arrive, or arrives much later, or arrives but isn't as revolutionary as promised...

By 2035 you're going to look around and everything will be made in China. Not because they're evil, but because while others dreamed, they built.

They'll have the most efficient supply chain, the cheapest manufacturing, the most advanced automation on the planet.

The United States will have beautiful papers on theoretical AGI. China will have everything else.

# Scenario 3: Nobody Wins Clearly

It could also happen that both are right and both are wrong.

That some form of AGI arrives but it's not the panacea. That China dominates manufacturing but can't make the leap to radical innovation.

In that case: Cold War 2.0, cyberpunk version. Two superpowers, each dominating part of the ecosystem, neither able to knock out the other.

# Scenario 4: The U.S. Bubble Explodes Before Reaching AGI

The bubble explodes and takes several economies with it. The recession deepens. China, though affected by the global recession, comes out ahead in the long run: while the United States deals with the collapse of inflated expectations and a confidence crisis, they continue with real infrastructure, intact manufacturing capacity, and a reputation as ""the ones who built while others speculated."" The United States is left with massive debt, investments burned on unfulfilled promises, and its credibility as a technology leader seriously damaged.

# Scenario 5: Total Fragmentation (Splinternet AI) but Neither Reaches AGI

The world divides into two completely incompatible technological ecosystems: one led by the United States, another by China. It's not that one wins, but that both create parallel universes.

Africa, Latin America, the Middle East have to choose sides. You can't use technology from both systems because they're fundamentally incompatible. It's like Android vs iOS, but multiplied by a thousand and with massive geopolitical consequences.

Your phone runs on Chinese or American AI. Your car too. Your healthcare system. Your bank. And none of them talk to each other. The world literally operates in two separate technological realities. Nobody wins totally, but we all lose the global interoperability we had.

# Scenario 6: Mutual Apocalypse (Digital MAD) but with AGI

Both achieve AGI almost simultaneously. The result is that neither can use it aggressively because the other has it too. A digital balance of terror is established, similar to the Mutually Assured Destruction of the nuclear Cold War.

Competition then shifts to who can use it more effectively for internal development, not global domination. Paradoxically, the most dangerous scenario ends up being the most stable.

But here's a macabre detail: this balance only works if both have mutual fear. What happens if one thinks it can win? Or if it misinterprets the other's capabilities? During the Cold War we almost blew up the planet several times due to misunderstandings. Now imagine that, but with AI systems making decisions in milliseconds.

# The Cards on the Table (And the Ones We Don't See)

Look, here are the cards we know:

**The United States is betting on:**

* A radical technological leap that may or may not arrive
* Burning obscene amounts of money and energy
* An architecture that its own creators say is stuck
* A financial bubble that can't collapse without taking everything down

**China is betting on:**

* Incremental dominance of manufacturing
* Civil-military fusion that multiplies its industrial capacity
* Pragmatism over ideology
* Constant building while others debate

**The cards we DON'T know:**

* Is there some technological breakthrough that changes everything?
* Is there secret research we're not seeing?
* How close or far away is AGI really?
* Can the Chinese model scale to radical innovation?
* Is there a third player we're not seeing?

# Final Reflection: We're Spectators

Argentina, Latin America, the rest of the world... we're the audience in this fight. We're not in the ring. We're not even at the betting table.

Does that mean it doesn't affect us? Quite the opposite. It affects us more because we can't choose.

We're going to live in the world built by the winners, whoever they are.

But at least we can understand the game they're playing. And maybe, just maybe, learn something without making the same mistakes.

Because history is full of empires that bet everything on a single card.

Some won. Most... well, you know how it ends.

She swings between acting like a kind, purpose-driven leader and exploding over the smallest administrative mistake. She’s accused team members of “betraying her trust” for things as minor as a mislabeled document, a typo in a text, or missing data in Excel.

  
She monitors everything — our Outlook calendars, Teams activity, and even document revision histories in SharePoint. We’re required to text her when we arrive at the office, when we start our next task, when we take lunch, when we leave for the day, and when we get home at night. If we don’t respond to a message within seconds, she’ll call or email repeatedly, sometimes three or four times in a row until we pick up.

  
The other day, she forgot her coffee mug and blamed it on me!

  
She also makes each of us submit a detailed daily schedule broken down into 30-minute increments. She watches that schedule like a hawk, and if we don’t text on time, there’s hell to pay. Any deviation from the schedule, even three minutes, can trigger a lecture about our commitment to the company.

  
On top of that, she requires us to work one to two hours after we get home from work and two to three hours every weekend on separate tasks.

  
When she’s angry, she’ll say things like, “I’m re-evaluating who belongs on this team.” Then, a couple of days later, she’s sending cheerful messages about how “lucky” she is to have us.

  
She’s also banned me from meeting with colleagues in other departments or talking to others in the industry, even outside work hours.... which I’m pretty sure is illegal in California.

  
The most unsettling part is that she never documents anything negative in writing: no emails, no HR trails. Only phone calls, texts, or closed-door meetings. It feels calculated, like she doesn’t want any record of her behavior. 

  
The anxiety on our team is through the roof. Many of us are working ourselves to exhaustion just to avoid being targeted, but it’s never enough. For anyone who’s navigated toxic leadership in the corporate world, how do I get out safely and protect my professional reputation in the process? 

Do I just start networking regardless?

I’m wondering if you all can share some hope with me since I’m struggling to find mine right now 🙏 (no advice plz)

For those interested in my history (includes symptom descriptions):

I’m 33, got my period at 11. excruciating periods that progressively got worse: always long, heavy, waves of overwhelming pelvic pain. I also struggle with GI issues, depression, anxiety. I have flu-like symptoms a lot (feverish, malaise). When I was 15 I experienced severe fatigue and brain fog and thought I must be getting sick but it never went away. Sex has always hurt, I just thought it was normal. Burning with urination, cramping before/during/after bowel movements. Low back pain all the time. Symptoms got worse into my 20s — barely made it through college — and way worse the last year or so. 

I’ve had every medical test imaginable, regular blood work, paps, all normal. I’ve done all the diets (Ayurvedic, anti-inflammatory, gluten-free, sugar-free, dairy-free, low FODMAP, low carb, high protein), acupuncture, Chinese medicine, mindfulness practices, rigorous cardio and strength training periods, supplements, herbs, cleanses, detoxes, wellness fads of all kinds, oral contraceptives, Mirena IUD. I now take a relatively high dose of a stimulant used for narcolepsy + coffee every morning and still want to pass out multiple times a day. There are many other symptoms I could name here. Despite all this, I’m still TERRIFIED that I’ll wake up from surgery and my endo specialist surgeon will say he didn’t find anything. It’s like I can’t bring myself to hope or believe this is going to change things.

I've been working on a browser-based idle RPG called **Folkhart** that's perfect for having open in a tab while you work or study. It's basically my ""I need something relaxing running in the background"" project that turned into an actual game lol.

**What makes it cozy:**

* Runs in your browser, no download needed
* Idle dungeon runs - set it and forget it while you do other stuff
* Cute pixel art aesthetic
* Guild system to hang out with other players
* No pressure gameplay - energy regenerates over time so you can play at your own pace
* Server chat to vibe with the community

It's got that classic RPG feel (classes, equipment, leveling up) but without the stress. I literally made it because I wanted something I could check on between meetings without feeling like I'm falling behind.

**Current state:** It's playable but definitely still in development. There are bugs (I know, I know), and I'm actively adding new content. That's where you come in!

I'm looking for some patient souls who'd be willing to test it out and give feedback. If you're the type who enjoys watching numbers go up while sipping coffee, this might be your jam, maybe you can join me and we can be a team! I'm a solo-dev on this project!

Fair warning: it's a passion project, so expect some rough edges. But if you're interested in helping shape a cozy game and don't mind the occasional ""wait, that's not supposed to happen"" moment, I'd love to have you!

drop a comment or DM me if you want to check it out. No commitment required - play as much or as little as you want!

1ojkovd,https://www.reddit.com/r/freemasonry/comments/1ojkovd/advice_on_joining_local_lodge/,Advice on joining local lodge,"Hi,

I was recently passed down an old Freemasonry book from a relative who died in the war, and that sparked my interest in learning more about the Freemasons. After about a year of having the book, I decided to reach out to my local lodge. I ended up getting along really well with the head there, we’ve had coffee a few times, and I genuinely liked what I saw in terms of their community service, philosophical outlook, and emphasis on good morals and self improvement.

The only part that gave me pause was that only men are permitted to join. That doesn’t really align with my personal values, but I figured it might be something I could compromise on for the sake of the experience.

I’ve only told two people that I was thinking of joining, and both reacted negatively, saying it’s secretive, elitist, or outdated. Now I’m feeling a bit unsure.

I’m 20, so I’d probably be the youngest member by a fair bit. For anyone with experience or insight, do you think it’s worth going through with it and seeing for myself? Is it genuinely a community focused organisation that respects religious freedom, or is there truth to the idea that it’s more of an exclusive boys club?

Thanks in advance for any perspectives.",4,1761781916.0,freemasonry,7,1.0,False

1ojklpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1ojklpu/stuff_ive_done_since_quitting_smoking/,stuff I've done since quitting smoking,"not giving myself the 90 day accolade yet, since nothing is for certain—except for a few things!!! here's some stuff I've most definitely done since quitting smoking cold turkey at the beginning of August. For the record, I read Allen Carr. It didn't brainwash me like I hoped, but I wanted it to work, so I made it work. This post is for anyone wondering whether life is boring after nicotine.

\- creative work — I actually posted in this sub months ago wondering how people make art after quitting. Happy to report that not only is it possible, it's actually even better. I feel myself improving significantly as a writer. 1.5 months ago a friend of mine who's been quit for quite a long time said the improvement is because 'you're not distracted anymore, you're actually focusing.' I didn't think I was not focusing before, but the results speak for themselves. Hard to describe this improvement exactly. It's like my writing has more substance. Maybe I'm just trying to prove to myself I still got it. Maybe quitting smoking is making me mature generally. Or maybe my friend was right—maybe I was distracted all along. 

\- visited Europe — okay first of all, I had the opportunity to travel to Italy and the Balkans arise since I quit smoking, which I consider  a sign from the universe that i'm on the right track! I saw someone on here post that they were sustaining their quit by convincing themselves they had to do it, for karmic purposes. I think to a degree, one can choose that mindset, and manifest it. Anyways, I'm a recovering alcoholic and I once used cigarettes to not drink in Europe. Never in a million years thought I could go eight days over there nicotine free, UNTIL I DID! Shout out to coffee and walking, my two drugs of choice. 

\- concerts — I've been to two since I quit. I know I crave when I feel like i'm 'partying' (solidified this neural pathway hardcore while quitting drinking) but I only realized over the past few months how stupid it is that I'd want to smoke in tandem with seeing a show because then you're not, like, seeing the show... anyways my favorite band ever did a DJ set and I'd really recommend that type of event if you're looking to learn how to dance/have fun again because I love the band so much that I'd dance if they put on ambient noise for an hour (which this band very much would do that as a prank, but I digress)

\- fought with my boyfriend — we still got it!!!!! my PMS has been INSANE since quitting smoking, and my boyfriend has Venus in Aries so we've had some pretty big blowouts. I love him, and he is IMMENSELY supportive 99% of the time, but we are all just human. I know that even if he helps me stay quit, I can't be doing this for him. It's 100% for me. And sometimes, when I'm angry, I stay quit to spite him (after taking a deep breath of course). Like, I'm not gonna falter for you, dipshit (/affectionate)

Other notes: my skin and my hair are so happy!!!! not to be vain on main but I didn't know I had so much room for improvement. I quit largely to save my insanely receding gums—they're looking better, more alive, more sturdy. last week I had a toothache so bad I thought I cracked a molar—nope, dentist said it was just gum irritation. by the end of last week it felt like every nerve in my mouth was coming alive again in a real, angry way. I didn't know they'd been so numb!!! now they're feeling back to normal, and I will never take it for granted again. 

Yes, I do get cravings. Sometimes like a motherfucker. Taking it one day at a time. I just will not smoke this hour, this evening, this week (if I'm feeling saucy). This year, really. I just have to make it through one year. That worked with quitting drinking, and I believe it will work with quitting smoking. 

I read the COPD subreddit sometimes when I'm jonesing too. Reminding myself that smoking is not a joke—like alcohol, it could (would) kill me. 

I quit when I turned 30, like I promised myself I would. smoking will not make me 25 again. in fact, it will take me further from 25 than I am now. it's tempting to miss that time, but I must face reality as it is. this reality can be better. it already kind of is. when I was 23 I thought I peaked at 16, but there was another big mountain top mere years away! I'm sure there is now, too. And when I feel like there's not, like all my best times are behind me, I remember that's literally just the drug addiction speaking.

okay that's my speech! if you read all that, you're a real one. sending love to everyobdy in this sub.",7,1761781688.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False

*In the early days of space exploration, especially during the time of the Independence Wars, the functions of admirals and captains were once again greatly expanded.*

*The Admiralty regained powers it hadn’t held since the first age of oceanic exploration on Terra. Months away from Earth, an admiral not only represented the military head of the fleet but also acted as governor and diplomat—sometimes even as ambassador for the Aligned Systems.*

*He had to be able to sign binding contracts with alien representatives, and any wrong move could reflect disastrously on Earth and its allies.*

*Excerpt from* **History of the Aligned Navy**, *813 P.I.*

 

“Sir, confirming five hundred twenty-six bogeys incoming from *Burrow*.”

Admiral Browner stood in the CIC. The ship’s interior repairs were almost complete; the hull and armor plating were a different issue. Yet he was glad his domain was clean and functioning at least.

“That’s not a multiple of thirty-four, so we can’t be sure they’re Batract.” He vocalized his thoughts aloud to sort them.

“No, sir. Their spacetime disruption is also different, and they’re flying at a lower speed. If I had to guess—it’s not Batract,” the scanner tech answered without looking up from her console.

“Why did we notice them so late?” Browner frowned. They had just started building up infrastructure—the last thing he needed now was another battle. Even their supply of micro A-drives was almost zero, since the fleet hadn’t had many to begin with, and building new ones was time-intensive.

“It seems Marjan’s Star is warping all of space on its side of the system.”

“What?” Browner had a guess what the tech was talking about, but he asked to make sure.

“Uh, the anomaly created by *Hyperion’s* sacrifice—it seems to have torn spacetime itself and is now a stable... something. The Shraphen call it Marjan’s Star in honor of Captain Karim.”

There it was again—the cut that hurt so badly. He had visited Chief Andrejewa yesterday, but the poor girl was still hollowed out by grief. The only thing left in her mind was caring for their babies—the five Glider newborns they had rescued from the Batract installation. He had wanted to ask if she could help redesign simpler micro A-drives, but he had to accept that she’d lost too much in the last few days. Maybe when they returned to Earth.

“What is it with this anomaly anyway? I would’ve guessed it had disappeared by now.”

“Sir, your twelve-hundred meeting—the astrophysicists of the fleet want to discuss a scientific mission to the anomaly.”

Airman Simmons seemed to materialize next to the admiral, tablet with the schedule in hand.

“Thank you, Simmons. While you’re at it, can you get me the Ark of the Covenant for my office?”

“Would love to, sir—but the government of Ethiopia is adamant about keeping it,” Simmons answered without missing a beat.

*And I’m still certain that if I made it an order, you’d get it in less than a day.*

The admiral studied his adjutant, still not entirely convinced he was a human being.

“Simmons, we don’t have time for separate meetings—too many things are happening at once. Make the twelve-hundred meeting a full senior-staff briefing. Invite Karrn and Fruug as well; we must coordinate a response with the Shraphen, no matter who the incoming fleet belongs to.”

Browner frowned. The meeting at lunchtime would cut any bullshit short—everyone would be hungry and eager to get it over with.

The senior tech shared a smile with Simmons, clearly having the same thought. “Yes, sir. Oh, and Dr. Nesbitt asks to speak with you regarding Lieutenant Davies’s situation.”

Davies—damn, he had almost forgotten. The lieutenant had suffered a severe reaction to the use of FTL ammunition, making the unofficial name of the rounds a macabre joke. The crew called them *Davies shots.*

Now the lieutenant was in an artificial coma, having sustained multiple mini-strokes.

“Tell her I’m on my way.” He rubbed the bridge of his nose. *David, you’re getting too old for the frontline. You should’ve taken the post in System Defense.*

“Already done. She’s waiting for you—Captain Gerber is also there.”

Of course he was. The injury to Davies had hit him hard; you could find him either next to her bed or in the isolation chamber.

Browner had organized what he could. His staff were all extremely capable, and the ship was in the best hands possible. Captain Carmichael and his crew were among the finest in the Navy.

He left the CIC, heading toward the infirmary. On the way, he checked his personal messages—Commander Reynolds, the former first officer of the *Hyperion,* had requested a meeting together with someone called *Fluffy IronBallz.*

The admiral blinked twice. That couldn’t be right. Checking the message again, he contacted Lyra.

*“Fluffy IronBallz is the self-given name of the elder Glider who was aboard the command shuttle that docked with* Argos *instead of the rescue fleet. The Gliders seem to have adopted a… colorful version of early twenty-first-century internet culture.”*

He shook his head, fighting the urge to laugh. Here he was—preparing again for the defense of a solar system against who-knows-what—and he was about to meet a forty-centimeter-long alien, a six-legged sugar glider named *Fluffy IronBallz.*

*With a goddamn “z.”*

He pressed the communicator on his uniform. “Simmons…”

“Commander Reynolds and Fluffy IronBallz—set for eleven-thirty, sir, in your private office.”

“Simmons…” One day, he’d find out how the man did that.

“Ethiopia is still adamant about keeping it, sir.”

Browner shook his head. It was now eleven hundred hours. Sometimes, he got the feeling Simmons was the one giving him orders.

*Eleven hundred—meet Nesbitt. Eleven-thirty—meet Reynolds. Twelve-hundred—staff briefing. Eighteen-hundred—repel invasion. And if you’re a good admiral, you get the evening off.*

Rubbing his temples against the oncoming headache, he met the female doctor in her office. Through the glass wall, he could see Captain Gerber reading a situation report to the comatose lieutenant.

“Morning, Doctor. How is she?” He wasn’t only concerned about her as a person—his concern was broader. If Davies’ condition indicated side effects from the use of *Davies' shots,* then everyone was in danger.

The doctor looked more exhausted than he felt. Glancing through the infirmary, he saw the entire medical staff worn thin—but the biologists seemed the worst off.

He remembered that only a fraction of the ship’s medical team were actual human doctors; a large part had studied medicine or biology and were training for the new field of interspecies medical care. Another sizable portion of the staff were originally veterinarians, since their education was far broader than that of most human physicians.

At first, he had been surprised to learn that, but the fleet simply had no experience in cross-species medicine. The Naval Medical Corps had decided it was easier to train mixed teams than to retrain a human doctor whose expertise was hyper-focused on human anatomy.

“Better. The Unigel is removing the blood clots that formed across her medial temporal lobe. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was hit especially hard, but we should be able to wake her in a day or two.”

The doctor pressed a button to make the glass walls opaque, then started a 3D projection of a brain, pointing to multiple zones within it.

“The thing is, according to Captain Gerber, Lieutenant Davies had shown problems with transitioning from the start. He said she got nauseous and dizzy, suggesting there was already some medical reason behind her reaction.”

Browner remembered that the lieutenant always went a little pale around the nose whenever the ship went into or out of transit.

Dr. Nesbitt continued, “We also noticed some irregularities along her temporal lobe. The neural connections there are denser than usual—nothing extreme, not enough that a standard medical check would detect it.”

“So, it’s not the ammunition per se—it’s how the spacetime warp interacts with her brain?”

“Presumably. However, Chief Ferguson informed me that they’ve tweaked the drives so that the shells no longer enter FTL inside the barrel, as it would stress the material too much anyway. We assume that will prevent this from happening again.”

The doctor closed the projection and sat down, taking a sip of her coffee.

“Too bad we didn’t do it sooner—especially for her. Will a normal transit worsen her condition?” The admiral sat down, checking his watch.

“No, sir, we don’t think so. The ship ‘slips’ into the anomaly, and we’re inside the hull while it happens. But when the gun fires, we feel the full brunt of the opening anomaly—outside any protective EM field. I assume you felt the shots too?”

He thought back. Yes—every shot felt like something had plucked at something inside his brain.

“Yes.”

“See? For her, it was the same—but much more intense.”

Seeing the dark rings beneath her eyes, he decided to check on the doctor herself. “How are you, Doctor? You all seem tired.”

“It’s fine. We just finished the medical center on the planet—it’s a lot of new data to process. The Batract samples, the tissue samples from the host, and now Lieutenant Davies’ condition… It’s a scientific field day for us, and we’re all excited. Just a bit exhausted, that’s all.”

The doctor smiled to underline that she was fine. He wasn’t entirely convinced—but then again, he’d never understood biologists’ fascination with… icky stuff.

Standing up and exchanging farewells, he left the infirmary, giving one last glance through the glass barrier toward Davies’ bed. Gerber was still there, reading softly to her.

*You got it, girl. Get well.*

Stepping out of the infirmary, he entered the busy hallway. Everywhere, engineers and matelots carried replacement parts or broken equipment to be fixed or reclaimed. No one seemed to give the admiral a second glance—beyond a quick salute or a nod if their hands were full.

Sometimes he had the feeling he was alone in a room full of people.

*“Move for me, move for me, move for me, eh-eh-eh*  
*And when you’re done, I’ll make you do it all again.”*

The refrain from an old song he’d heard at his grandfather’s home when he was a child came to mind—an uninvited echo reminding him of his situation. A thousand loose parts and not enough time to fix everything—just barely enough to keep it all from collapsing.

The ping of an incoming report pulled him out of his childhood memories and back into the present.

Captain Gerber’s report on the prisoner.

Glancing over it on his way to his quarters, he got the gist—seven hundred fifty-four words to say the same thing: nothing to report. The prisoner didn’t react to anything.

Gerber could become a politician—his ability to say nothing in a wall of text would fit perfectly in the EarthGov Senate.

The constant noise of people moving faded as he turned off the main hallway toward his quarters. From a distance, he could already see Reynolds with the elder Glider perched on his shoulder.

The entire crew of the *Hyperion* seemed to have adopted this habit of carrying the Gliders that way. Browner wondered if it was because of their shared experience on the seemingly cursed ship—or something else entirely.

The commander saluted as soon as he saw the admiral. Browner just nodded.

He remembered activating the new addition to his implant so he could *hear* the Glider. *At this rate, my brain will be fully robotic before retirement.*

“Come in, Commander. Mr. Fluffy—?” He still wasn’t sure how to address the small creature on the commander’s shoulder.

The answer—or rather, the way he received the answer—surprised the admiral.

*‘Y’all can call me IronBallz, Admiral. Nice ship you got here. Was a hell of a joy to see that damn fungus getting wiped out.’*

The contrast was surreal. On one side, he saw a cute, six-legged, sugar glider–like alien eating a grape on the shoulder of a naval officer. On the other hand, the voice echoing inside his head sounded like an old biker from one of those grainy two-dimensional movies his parents and grandparents used to watch.

“Oh, yes, thank you.” He pointed to his couch. “Please, sit.”

The Glider jumped off the commander’s shoulder and glided the two meters through the air to the couch, his six legs spread wide and his tail steering just like his Terran counterparts.

*Gliders. Yeah, of course.*

The commander grinned knowingly at the admiral. He was already accustomed to the Gliders, but he seemed to remember how surprising their behavior had been the first time.

“Gentlemen, Coffee? Water?” Simmons asked, somehow managing to appear out of nowhere beside the admiral’s guests.

*‘Where the fuck did you come from?’* The admiral grinned. IronBallz didn’t hide his surprise—his tail shot up, and all his fur bristled in a defensive posture.

The commander was also startled but seemed unsurprised after hearing the stories about Simmons’ *gift.*

“The admiral would say I have a micro A-drive up some orifice,” Simmons added with a somewhat tired expression.

*‘I’d say the admiral’s right. I’ll take an Irish coffee if you have one.’*

To the Glider’s surprise, Simmons turned around and already had a tray with three drinks prepared—a cup of Irish coffee included.

“*Well, spank my ass and call me Charlie! Now he’s clairvoyant too?*” The Glider jumped and landed perfectly on the cup, taking small sips.  
“Yeah, that’s good shit.”

The admiral tried to hold his composure the whole time, taking his coffee from Simmons with a thankful nod and watching Reynolds and IronBallz drink theirs. He waited until they spoke, not entirely sure what the meeting was about.

The commander gave a slight nod to the little Glider—a signal for him to start.

*“See, Admiral, you got fifteen Gliders aboard, not counting Alex’s babies. Not saying we aren’t grateful to be rescued from* Hyperion, *but you did a weak-ass job using us—pardon my French.*”

Fifteen. He didn’t know there were so many. The last days had been a blur.

“Sorry if we offended you, but how would you use you? And why, for us you’re refugees.” The admiral knew that some Gliders had been crucial in stabilizing *Hyperion’s* broken fusion core, but he hadn’t thought about it beyond the reports.

The Glider took another big sip; droplets of coffee remained on the fur around his muzzle, and he cleaned them with his front legs.

*My daughter would have cried about how cute he is.*

*“See, we Gliders are smart. We share knowledge in a way you can’t understand. Humans—humans are big, strong, and somewhat stupid. Among the Gliders we have aboard are biotech specialists and engineers.”*

The Glider cleaned his nose and muzzle again.

*“Don’t get me wrong—your engineers aren’t retarded, with the FTL cannon and so on, but we can help repair the ship. A Glider can reach parts of the ship where you guys have to dismantle half a deck to get to. Let us help.”*

Ignoring the insult, the admiral didn’t need long to think about it—every hand counted, or paws in the Gliders’ case.

“Sure. I’ll clear everything with the department heads, and your people can help as they like.” The admiral was about to get up when he remembered to ask another question.

“IronBallz, what is your specialty?”

The small alien suddenly looked menacing, his big, black, pupil-less eyes staring directly at the admiral.

*“Me? I learned to hack Batract brains. Got one to crack open?”*

My family is considering a move to the area Summer 2026 from the Bay Area - my husband has been recruited to the new cancer hospital at City of Hope Irvine. This is a big decision for our family and we would so appreciate insight from the local community. We have a few considerations we are mulling over and would love thoughts from anyone who can speak to the following: 



**Community/Walkability**

Our priority is walkability to nearby community, as we will be new to the area and would love to make connections - grocery shops, coffee/library and community programming. We have seen a wonderful group called LB Parents Group, which looks promising! 

We are a family that values saying hello to neighbors of all demographics, and are seeking this feeling wherever we land. We love the outdoors, walking/biking and hiking. My husband is originally from Newport Beach and we are familiar with that area, but are looking for a town that may feel a bit more connected and closer to my Sonoma / Marin county roots :) Welcome any thoughts or recommendations here in terms of areas we could test out by renting. We are a family of 4 (2 young children) no pets and good employment/credit!



**Preschools / Housing** 

We’ll be looking for a long-term rental home (3+ bedrooms) to start as we learn the area, as well as a preschool for our children, and I’d be so grateful for any recommendations from locals to help guide us.

  
We’ve identified Anneliese Schools which at first glance look lovely, but I’ve seen some discouraging reviews online so curious about experiences here, as well as Laguna Beach Montessori. Our 3yr old is currently at a Reggio Emelia based school where he has thrived and we would be so thankful to find something similar in the area. We both work full time so are looking for a program that can accommodate a full day. 



In all, my partner is grateful for this opportunity to serve the community through City of Hope, and we very much appreciate any recommendations on where might be best for us to raise our family. Thank you!",0,1761781514.0,LagunaBeach,1,0.5,False

I love tobacco vanille but it’s so incredibly strong I wish it was an edt or there was a good alternative with less oomph for more casual nights. Cafe rose was disappointing as it’s like 99.9% rose and .01% coffee definite grandma perfume would not say it’s unisex. Lost cherry was everything that I expected except the rose notes seem kinda cheap if that makes sense.

My questions are is there anything close to the deep goodness of TF tobacco vanille but just not so damn strong? And I’m looking at Ébène Fumé but I’m curious if it has the same overpowering cloud of smell effect as tobacco vanille? Also bitter peach sounds like a good one but I am afraid it might be too feminine and since no one carries TF near me I’d be blind buying all of these. ",0,1761781477.0,Colognes,8,0.25,False

I loved authentic books but unfortunately they're so far behind on shipping...

1ojkg5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HubermanLab/comments/1ojkg5v/19m_my_chronic_neck_problem_has_ruined_my_life/,19M. My chronic neck problem has ruined my life. Please help,"Hello everyone,

I am a **19-year-old guy** and in the last year and a half **my life as I knew it has disappeared due to health problems**, so if you have a couple of minutes, I would appreciate it if you could read the post in case you can help me or give me some advice, thanks in advance.

It all started in the summer of 2024 when I was working at the busiest bar in my city. The high demand and my own high expectations meant that for months, day after day, I was working under a lot of **stress** for many hours, literally running from one place to another, lifting heavy weights with poor posture, drinking a significant amount of caffeine every day, eating poorly, and not getting enough rest at night.

After a few weeks, I began to notice overload and pain in my trapezius and cervical areas, but I didn't pay much attention to it. This pain turned into **dizziness** and **headaches**, so I started taking several strong anti-inflammatories every day, which led to digestive problems after a few weeks.

I was diagnosed with **Marsh 1** in my small intestine and started a diet. (The digestive problem is not what concerns me the most, so I won't go into too much detail).

The neck discomfort continued to worsen day after day until today, when I have seen more than 15 doctors, including physical therapists, orthopedists, neurologists...

After X-rays and MRIs, I was told that I have a **C5-C6 protrusion, disc degeneration, and cervical osteoarthritis**. In addition to physical therapy, I have had a **myofascial block and an occipital nerve block in the back of my head**, since when the pain worsened, it moved to that area, but **according to the doctors, the radiological results do not match my symptoms.**

To summarize:

**Current symptom**s: Pain and pressure in the upper cervical area where it joins the skull, pain and pressure in the back and top of the head, but above all, a severe lack of energy:

\-I wake up **tired** even if I sleep 10 hours

\-Coffee has no effect on me (it's not because of tolerance because I stopped drinking it a while ago).

\-I feel **weak** all day.

I'm not doing anything at the moment. I was fired from my job for taking sick leave because of these problems, and my daily routine consists of sitting at the computer and sometimes meeting up with friends.

My main hypothesis is that the source of my systemic exhaustion and **ANS dysregulation** is chronic structural irritation in the upper cervical spine (craniocervical junction C0-C1-C2).

\-I have ordered **BPC157, TB500, Ipamorelin, CJC1295, and ARA290** to see if they work.

\-I am currently taking **Sertraline** (SSRI antidepressant).

I also wonder if it is simply **psychosomatic pain** and it is all **chronic fatigue.**

I would greatly appreciate the perspective of anyone who has gone through something similar. I am interested in any available treatments and any advice.

Thank you for reading this far.

But one sunny weekend, a bucket of stain, a brush, and a sander brought hope back to the surface.

First, for context, I'm 28 and never had a girlfriend. I started going to college nearly 3 years ago, at first I wasn't talking to anyone because I have always been very shy, but over time some people noticed me and started to invite me to hang out with them.

This has been my social life through most of my first year, just talking to this few guys and girls who were nice enough to include me, but during the last few months I began to take notice of a girl who I have only spoken to a couple of times, she messaged me once asking me for help with something about a subject and we didn't talk much beyond that.

I noticed that she didn't seemed to have any friends and was always by herself, and also she was wearing a shirt from a metal band which draw my attention, as I'm also into that type of music. So I began talking to her, and she seemed to actually enjoy talking to me, which made me really happy. Over time as I got to know her more and saw how similar our interests were and how well our personalities seemed to mesh together, I noticed how I was starting to like her romantically, but then summer break came (I'm in the southern hemisphere) and we didn't see each other for a couple of months, but I had her number so I kept texting her.

The thing though is that she stopped responding to my texts, in fact she wasn't even reading them. I thought it was weird and felt pretty bad about it, because even if she would turn out to not like me back I was still happy to have her as a friend, but I moved on, stopped thinking of her and even started to talk to someone who I met through an app.

Fast forward a couple of months summer break was over and we were about to start the next year, and out of a sudden she texts me again, asking me something about college. I responded politely but didn't think much of it, as I had already made my mind and thought that if she ghosted me through all of summer I wasn't going to let myself get attached to her again. She messaged me again a couple of days later, asking me if I was still going to college because she hadn't seen me, and I told her that I was going to skip the first week because I was still on vacations, but would return to classes after that. I also remember a friend from college told me about how he saw her all alone and I felt pretty bad for her, but I was still hurt about being ghosted so I was still firm on my decision.

When I finally saw her I acted pretty cold, I didn't even said hi to her. The next day though, she texted me asking if I wanted to sit with her, to which I agreed, though still a little skeptical, and although I sat with her I didn't hang out with her during recess. My friend however who was unaware of her having ghosted me and knew of my old crush on her, convinced me to spend more time with her so I began also spending the recesses with her, and I ended up quickly forgiving her without even bringing it up or even asking her why she ghosted me, I just brushed it off as us not being too close yet and her being shy, and because now she was going out of her way to spend time with me, well, it felt nice to feel wanted by a woman for the first time in my life, even if it was probably only as a friend I didn't cared.

It goes without saying that I once again began to crush on her super hard, way harder than before, even going as far as to stop chatting with the other girl because I didn't felt comfortable with it anymore when I only wanted to be with this girl from class.

Through the first half of the year we were together basically all the time, as we saw each other 5 times a week, would sit together in class and during recess we'd hang out and would drink a coffee and eat something. Outside of class we would text each other and we'd hang out in Discord to play games or study together. I also got the impression a few times that she may like me back, but i was never sure if she did or only saw me as a friend, and I enjoyed her friendship so much that I couldn't bring myself to push for more than that and end up ruining it.

Through the second half of the year we were seeing each other a lot less, but wherever our classes happened to coincide we were still hanging out. She however began to respond to my texts a lot less often, it remind me a lot to when she ghosted me through the first year's summer break, but wherever we saw each other in person she was being super nice so I assumed there must be a reason for it.

The last day of class we spent all day together, and when we were done instead of saying bye and going our respective ways she wanted us to hang out for a bit more, so we went for something to eat and spend a good amount of time chatting about a bunch of stuff, then I followed her to her stop and we made plans to watch a movie through Discord in a few days.

There has been a few moments where I felt like I should have tried to kiss her, one was when I took her home on my motorcycle, and this was another one of them. I didn't because I wasn't sure about how she felt about me, and I assumed I'd get another chance, but this was the last time I saw her, it has been nearly a year since then.

After that she began to respond to my texts less and less, eventually reaching a point where she'd go for months without texting back. The next year I didn't saw her anymore, and later after a few months of silence she texted me again to tell me she dropped out of college for economical reasons, and that she hopes to continue eventually. This was followed by a few more months of silence, until she messaged me again to ask for advice with something, and then radio silence again to this day.

Yesterday I went to see a band that I was introduced to by her, and it made me think of her a lot, how much she meant to me through those two years, how much I wished she were there with me, and how I'm unable to let go of her. I'm also a bit ashamed to admit I kept looking at the crowd from time to time, hoping to see her there.

Honestly not even a single day has passed where I haven't thought of her at least once, and as much as I know it's unhealthy to keep this obsession going, I'm still clinging to the possibility that maybe she has a good reason for acting the way she does and some day she'll want to hang out with me again.

However what I regretted the most is not having told her how I felt, I felt like if I got rejected right away I would have gotten over it by now, but being left hanging like this not knowing if I had a chance or not makes it so much worse. When I think of how perfect this last day was to confess to her and how that thought crossed my mind, and I dismissed it thinking I'd have another chance not knowing that was the last.

Hell, I even dream of her from time to time. Most of my dreams only consist on me randomly stumbling across her, usually in college, and just hanging up and talking like in the old times. Yesterday I dreamed of her again but this time was a bit different, I hardly remember anything other than her being on it, but I'm pretty sure I kissed her in my dream. I think it's kinda sad how not even in my dreams we are dating, except for this last one I guess of which I don't remember anything of.

I don't even know what to think of all this, I know she has issues of her own since she had to drop out, but I feel like if she cared about me and trusted me she would talk to me about it rather than soft ghosting me. And I also can't figure out if she liked me but got bored of me treating her like a friend, if she only ever liked me as a friend, or if she never liked me in any way and only hanged out with me because she had no one else to talk to.

I don't even know what to expect out of making this post, I guess I just want to vent, that's why I chosen that flair, because I have never been able to talk about all this with this much detail with anyone, and I feel like that may make me feel better. Honestly I feel really pathetic for still being so attached to someone who may not even care about me.",4,1761781116.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

I am a **19-year-old guy** and in the last year and a half **my life as I knew it has disappeared due to health problems**, so if you have a couple of minutes, I would appreciate it if you could read the post in case you can help me or give me some advice, thanks in advance.

It all started in the summer of 2024 when I was working at the busiest bar in my city. The high demand and my own high expectations meant that for months, day after day, I was working under a lot of **stress** for many hours, literally running from one place to another, lifting heavy weights with poor posture, drinking a significant amount of caffeine every day, eating poorly, and not getting enough rest at night.

After a few weeks, I began to notice overload and pain in my trapezius and cervical areas, but I didn't pay much attention to it. This pain turned into **dizziness** and **headaches**, so I started taking several strong anti-inflammatories every day, which led to digestive problems after a few weeks.

I was diagnosed with **Marsh 1** in my small intestine and started a diet. (The digestive problem is not what concerns me the most, so I won't go into too much detail).

The neck discomfort continued to worsen day after day until today, when I have seen more than 15 doctors, including physical therapists, orthopedists, neurologists...

After X-rays and MRIs, I was told that I have a **C5-C6 protrusion, disc degeneration, and cervical osteoarthritis**. In addition to physical therapy, I have had a **myofascial block and an occipital nerve block in the back of my head**, since when the pain worsened, it moved to that area, but **according to the doctors, the radiological results do not match my symptoms.**

To summarize:

**Current symptom**s: Pain and pressure in the upper cervical area where it joins the skull, pain and pressure in the back and top of the head, but above all, a severe lack of energy:

\-I wake up **tired** even if I sleep 10 hours

\-Coffee has no effect on me (it's not because of tolerance because I stopped drinking it a while ago).

\-I feel **weak** all day.

I'm not doing anything at the moment. I was fired from my job for taking sick leave because of these problems, and my daily routine consists of sitting at the computer and sometimes meeting up with friends.

My main hypothesis is that the source of my systemic exhaustion and **ANS dysregulation** is chronic structural irritation in the upper cervical spine (craniocervical junction C0-C1-C2).

\-I have ordered **BPC157, TB500, Ipamorelin, CJC1295, and ARA290** to see if they work.

1ojk8ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1ojk8ee/aita_for_not_wanting_to_see_my_sister_after_how/,AITA for not wanting to see my sister after how she treated me during her wedding year?,"This is a long one, so thank you in advance if you stick with it.

My (28F) sister “B” (25F) got married this August, and I’ve been struggling to move past how she treated me and our other sister “A” (25F) before and during the whole thing.

For some background, there was already family tension brewing. B got engaged in 2022 after three years with her now-husband. They’re both indecisive, so the planning dragged on until September 2024, when they finally set a date for August 2025. Then, two months later, our brother “D” (28M) proposed to his girlfriend and planned a May 2025 wedding. Cue holiday drama.

After B got engaged, she asked A and me to plan her bachelorette party — she didn’t want a bridal party, so this was our big role. We spent eight months organizing a 5-day trip for 15 women because that’s what she wanted. It went really well overall, but when we got home, B told everyone it was “terrible” and that I personally ruined it because I “didn’t relax” and “had an attitude.”

A completely disagreed — she thought B was the one being tense and rude. B never thanked us for the months of work or money we put in. When I tried to talk to her about how hurtful that was, she got even angrier.

Then came the pre-wedding chaos. Our brother “C” (25M) asked if he could bring his girlfriend of four months to the wedding. B and husband said yes. Later, though, she randomly announced that the girlfriend wasn’t allowed at the venue until guests arrived — even though the venue was remote, and we (the family) had to be there at 9 a.m. for a 3 p.m. ceremony.

When we tried to point out how unreasonable that was, B lost it:

“I DON’T GIVE A F*** ABOUT HER. I DON’T EVEN KNOW HER.”
“SHE’S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY.”
“F*** ALL OF THESE SIGNIFICANT OTHERS — THIS IS MY DAY ABOUT ME.”
“I’VE WAITED 3 F***ING YEARS FOR THIS AND I HAVE TO CATER TO HER?”

She even dragged my partner of nearly 2 years into it screaming about how they don’t fucking matter. 

A and I tried to explain that it just felt mean and again she screamed:

“AND WHO THE F*** ARE YOU TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO AT MY WEDDING?”

Then came the actual wedding — a five-day destination event. The family was told we had to arrive three days early to help set up. When we finally got the schedule (two weeks before), it turned out we could’ve come the day before.

The morning of, we were told to be there at 8 a.m. for hair and makeup. There was no food, coffee, or plan. A and I ended up using our own money to buy breakfast and drinks for everyone — including the stylists. Meanwhile, B nitpicked everything we did and was openly cold toward me. Multiple people asked me if something was wrong because it was that obvious.

The crazy part this isn’t even everything, just a highlight reel. 

Overall the wedding itself went smoothly, and I gave my speech, but I left feeling drained and unappreciated. Months later, B seems to have “reset” from her Bridezilla phase, but I can’t shake how she treated us. She was entitled, ungrateful, and just mean.

Now she wants to get together over Thanksgiving, but honestly? I don’t want to go out of my way to make time for her. Things don’t feel the same, and I’m not sure I even want to rebuild that closeness right now.

So, AITA for not wanting to see my sister after how she acted during her wedding?",71,1761780752.0,TwoHotTakes,41,0.97,False

That promise did not come to pass. Just like yesterday, I had to put off my plans to work until 5:30 p.m. and I just did not have it in me to immediately go upstairs and start working on my statue. I'm tired. I'm sore. Frankly, until after I had something to eat, I was boiling with rage. A small platter of nachos has cooled my temper down.

Change of plans. I'm going to relax first and work later. I am going to have my evening coffee and then, probably around 10 p.m., I'm going to go upstairs and get what I need to get done, done. There is a lot I need to do and I am not sure if I'll be able to do it. I'm just going to try. Not right now, of course, but I will try later. After mu coffee. I even made myself a to-do list. I'll just copy it down here, if only to add to the word count;

1. Set up hot glue and clay

2. Take down braces and assess damage

3. Make the hands

4. Fix any cracks and sand down

5. Use wire and cloth to make spider-webbed shaped braces if statue still can't hold pose

6. Cut and add paper between wing bones with hot glue.

7. Paint the whole thing black

That is all I have to do. It is a lot. I'm not looking forward to it. I also have fucking garbage to gather but frankly, I'm doing the bare fucking minimum with that. I have my own fucking business to attend to. Leave me to it for fucking minutes please.

# I secretly quit my job six months ago and no one noticed

  
I (28M) worked remote for a mid-sized tech company. When our manager left, the team fell apart, everyone doing random tasks, no one checking up on anything.

One day I realized I could just… stop. So I did. I stopped logging in. No one noticed. My direct reports assumed I was working on “backend admin stuff.” HR never followed up. I still got paid.

It’s been six months. I wake up, make coffee, play games, walk my dog, and nap. Payroll keeps depositing my check. I’m terrified to touch anything or alert them, but also weirdly proud of how long this has gone.

I know I’m stealing. I know it’ll catch up. But the freedom has been euphoric. I think I might actually cry the day they finally notice I don’t exist.",1,1761780515.0,dcfrenchstudent,0,1.0,False

1ojk4nr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ojk4nr/sudden_kidney_pain/,Sudden Kidney Pain,"Here is a detailed description of what happened to me and I really need an answer for this. 

I was staying up all night walking, drank coffee (I had a good sleep beforehand), and then slept for two hours before I woke up to a pain in my left kidney (you can say in my waist side) and it progressively got so bad that I had to leave my lecture only after 5 minutes then I started to go to the bathroom every minute but only a drop of urine is there and the pain gets worse. I immediately knew what this will lead to because I had the same pain 2 years ago suddenly so I started drinking water and took a medicine (Rofenac). The pain got so bad that I threw up all the water I drank and medicine I took. I started crying due to the intense pain up until I calmed down a bit and slept. Then I spent the entire day being in my bed and sleeping. I'm now putting off my lectures because I can't attend them due to the pain. 

The pain however subsided a bit, I got another medicine that I'm on which is Renalof and it's been one day since I'm taking it (every 8 hours). But the pain can come and go slightly. One thing for sure is that it burns down there where I pee. I can't pee a lot and I feel like I get this intense burning sensation when I pee and it subsides a bit after like 30 minutes but it's still there. 

I need help cuz I'm currently away from my family and I'm alone so please if anyone can answer me I would be grateful. 🙏 

I also feel saw that my weight increased a bit even though I'm not eating much, and I'm drinking so much water after I got that pain. I drink parsley water too which I boiled and chilled in the fridge.

I had this pain 4 times in my life now. The first time was when I was 9 years old.

1ojk3h4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BioHumanEvolution/comments/1ojk3h4/biohack_your_cells_everything_you_need_to_know/,"⚙️ Biohack Your Cells: Everything You Need to Know About Autophagy, Insulin Sensitivity & Mitochondrial Renewal in 2025","# 🔬 Autophagy, Insulin Sensitivity & Mitochondrial Rejuvenation

At the deepest level, biohacking isn’t about supplements or tracking apps — it’s about optimizing *cellular intelligence.*  
Three of the most powerful levers for that are **autophagy**, **insulin sensitivity**, and **mitochondrial rejuvenation.**

These interconnected processes determine how well you age, recover, and produce energy — and when optimized, they can transform metabolism, longevity, and performance.

Let’s break them down 👇

# 🧹 1. Autophagy — The Body’s Internal Detox System

**Autophagy (from Greek “auto-phagein,” meaning “self-eating”)** is your body’s built-in cleanup crew.

It removes damaged proteins, misfolded cells, and metabolic waste — recycling the parts to build new, healthier cells.

**What triggers autophagy:**

* Fasting (12–36+ hours)
* Exercise-induced stress
* Heat/cold exposure
* Caloric restriction or ketogenic states

**Benefits:**  
✅ Cellular repair & regeneration  
✅ Improved immune function  
✅ Reduced inflammation & oxidative stress  
✅ Anti-aging through removal of senescent cells

**Biohacker’s tip:** Combine intermittent fasting with light exercise and sauna/cold therapy to maximize autophagy naturally.

# 💉 2. Insulin Sensitivity — The Metabolic Switch

Insulin controls how your body processes glucose — and your sensitivity to it determines whether you burn **fat for fuel** or store **fat for later.**

When cells become resistant to insulin, the body compensates with higher levels, driving inflammation, fatigue, and fat gain.  
Improving insulin sensitivity is the foundation for reversing metabolic disease and enhancing longevity.

**How to improve insulin sensitivity:**

* Intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding
* Strength training & Zone 2 cardio
* Low-glycemic, nutrient-dense diets
* Cold exposure & stress management
* Sleep optimization (poor sleep spikes insulin resistance by up to 30%)

**Key metrics to track:**

* Fasting insulin (ideal: <7 μIU/mL)
* HOMA-IR score
* Continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data

**Biohacker’s tip:** Try 16:8 fasting + 3–4 resistance sessions per week + sleep tracking for maximum metabolic control.

# ⚡ 3. Mitochondrial Rejuvenation — The Powerhouse Reboot

Your mitochondria are the **energy engines** of every cell — producing ATP (energy currency) that powers movement, cognition, and longevity.  
Over time, mitochondrial function declines due to oxidative damage and metabolic stress — leading to fatigue, inflammation, and accelerated aging.

**How to rejuvenate mitochondria:**

* Regular fasting and autophagy cycles
* Red & near-infrared light exposure
* NAD⁺ boosters (NMN, NR, or IV therapy)
* Exercise — especially HIIT & Zone 2 training
* Cold therapy and mild oxidative stress (hormesis)

**Nutrients that support mitochondrial repair:**

* **CoQ10, PQQ, ALA, L-Carnitine** — enhance energy transport
* **Magnesium, Riboflavin, Omega-3s** — support ATP synthesis
* **Sulforaphane & Curcumin** — boost mitochondrial biogenesis

**Biohacker’s tip:** Combine fasting, movement, and red light therapy for synergistic mitochondrial upgrades.

# 🔁 The Feedback Loop

These three systems reinforce each other:

|System|Key Benefit|Primary Trigger|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Autophagy**|Cellular cleanup & renewal|Fasting / Caloric restriction|
|**Insulin Sensitivity**|Metabolic flexibility|Exercise / Sleep / Low-glycemic diet|
|**Mitochondrial Rejuvenation**|Energy & longevity|Light therapy / NAD⁺ / Hormesis|

Optimizing one boosts the others — creating a **regenerative feedback loop** that enhances energy, focus, and lifespan simultaneously.

# 🧭 Biohacker Protocol Example

**Morning:** Fasted walk or Zone 2 cardio → black coffee + electrolytes  
**Midday:** Protein + healthy fats meal  
**Evening:** Sauna + cold exposure → high-magnesium meal  
**Weekly:** 24-hour fast (autophagy cycle) + red light therapy

This rhythm balances metabolic stress with recovery, driving cellular adaptation without burnout.

# 💬 Community Discussion

* How do you structure your fasting or training schedule to target autophagy and mitochondrial repair?
* Have you tested your fasting insulin, CGM data, or NAD⁺ levels?
* Which combination (fasting, light, exercise, peptides) has improved your energy or recovery the most?

Drop your data and results — help map the blueprint of biological renewal.

Always warm, always ready when I woke up.

I changed the locks, installed a camera.
The next night, I woke to the smell of coffee.
The mug was waiting on the table, next to a folded napkin with the words:

I checked the footage.
At 3:11 a.m., the camera glitched—just static for four minutes.
When the feed came back, the plate was on the counter.
Nobody there.

I stopped eating the food after that.
Started sleeping with my bedroom door locked.

Yesterday I checked into a small place off the interstate. The kind with the buzzing vacancy sign and the keys still on metal rings.

The room looked fine—clean enough, neutral colors—but the bathroom mirror caught my eye.
It was larger than usual, stretching from the sink to the ceiling, edges dark like the silver was burning away.

When I turned on the light, I noticed something strange: the reflection wasn’t exact.
A towel was missing from the rack.
The shower curtain was drawn open in the mirror but closed in real life.

I blinked, looked again—everything matched again. Probably exhaustion, I thought.

Later that night, brushing my teeth, I realized the light in the reflection was still on even after I switched mine off.
The mirror room stayed bright.

I leaned closer.
In the reflection, the bathroom door was cracked open, showing a sliver of the hotel room beyond.
Except in the mirror version, someone was sitting on the bed—still, facing the bathroom.

I turned fast—nothing there.
When I looked back, the figure in the mirror was standing now, right behind where my reflection should’ve been.

I covered the mirror with a towel and went to bed fully dressed.
At 3:17 a.m., something thumped against the bathroom door from the inside.
When I turned on the lamp, the towel had fallen off the mirror.

The reflection showed the room exactly as it was—
except the door to the hallway was open.

I am a **19-year-old guy** and in the last year and a half **my life as I knew it has disappeared due to health problems**, so if you have a couple of minutes, I would appreciate it if you could read the post in case you can help me or give me some advice, thanks in advance.



It all started in the summer of 2024 when I was working at the busiest bar in my city. The high demand and my own high expectations meant that for months, day after day, I was working under a lot of **stress** for many hours, literally running from one place to another, lifting heavy weights with poor posture, drinking a significant amount of caffeine every day, eating poorly, and not getting enough rest at night.

After a few weeks, I began to notice overload and pain in my trapezius and cervical areas, but I didn't pay much attention to it. This pain turned into **dizziness** and **headaches**, so I started taking several strong anti-inflammatories every day, which led to digestive problems after a few weeks.

I was diagnosed with **Marsh 1** in my small intestine and started a diet. (The digestive problem is not what concerns me the most, so I won't go into too much detail).

The neck discomfort continued to worsen day after day until today, when I have seen more than 15 doctors, including physical therapists, orthopedists, neurologists...

After X-rays and MRIs, I was told that I have a **C5-C6 protrusion, disc degeneration, and cervical osteoarthritis**. In addition to physical therapy, I have had a **myofascial block and an occipital nerve block in the back of my head**, since when the pain worsened, it moved to that area, but **according to the doctors, the radiological results do not match my symptoms.**

To summarize:

**Current symptom**s: Pain and pressure in the upper cervical area where it joins the skull, pain and pressure in the back and top of the head, but above all, a severe lack of energy:

\-I wake up **tired** even if I sleep 10 hours

\-Coffee has no effect on me (it's not because of tolerance because I stopped drinking it a while ago).

\-I feel **weak** all day.

I'm not doing anything at the moment. I was fired from my job for taking sick leave because of these problems, and my daily routine consists of sitting at the computer and sometimes meeting up with friends.

My main hypothesis is that the source of my systemic exhaustion and **ANS dysregulation** is chronic structural irritation in the upper cervical spine (craniocervical junction C0-C1-C2).

\-I have ordered **BPC157, TB500, Ipamorelin, CJC1295, and ARA290** to see if they work.

\-I am currently taking **Sertraline** (SSRI antidepressant).

I also wonder if it is simply **psychosomatic pain** and it is all **chronic fatigue.**

I would greatly appreciate the perspective of anyone who has gone through something similar. I am interested in any available treatments and any advice.

Hello! 
Please read the whole thing. 
I don’t want the relationship to be based on just sexual stuff, I want a meaningful connection. 

So little bit about me:
I’m 5’5, 145 pounds. I’m somewhat an athletic to normal build. I’ve got hazel eyes with a long curly brown hair. I am ambitious, kind, and confident,I love diving into meaningful conversations, forever chasing new experiences. I enjoy writing, singing, lots of sports, and workout. I study in a university, and my degree requires me to be taken care of:). I’m  going back and forth between Egypt and UAE, might relocate after my degree. I’m also Muslim. 

What I’m looking for?: 
I’m looking for a manly, caring, and affectionate guy who loves to spoil me in every way. Isn’t afraid to show feelings and treat me like I deserve. Someone manly yet caring, who can make me laugh, hold deep conversations, and show genuine affection. I love thoughtful gestures, surprises, and someone who can keep up with my energy while being my rock at the same time. Bonus points if you love night adventures, iced coffee, or singing along to your favorite songs!

I prefer someone older as mentioned, so the older the better. I prefer someone who’s taller, fit to normal build. 

Please if you’re in a relationship, don’t message me. (Don’t start the conversation with just a hey please)
Thank you!💗

1ojjx92,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1ojjx92/review_of_resilient_lady_greek_island_glow/,Review of Resilient Lady - Greek Island Glow,"I had a good time on Virgin's Greek Island Glow cruise, which commenced on October 10, 2025 and want to give you all the deets. 

A BIT ABOUT ME 
I'm a 35 year old woman, married with no kids, living in the San Francisco bay area. I consider myself a foodie, and recognize that I have generally high standards, lol. I went on the cruise with my husband as part of a trip through central/eastern Europe. 

VIRGIN'S TARGET AUDIENCE 
 Thirty and forty somethings who want to get a taste of the Greek islands, relax, socialize, and spend big. 

$$$$$
This cruise wasn't cheap. For a balcony room we paid approx. USD $5600, working out to about $800 a night. I write this review in light of the price. 

THE ENTERTAINMENT 
Finally, some entertainment that felt tailored to me and not an older crowd. I loved scarlet night, the music selection around the ship, DJs and shows, especially Lola's Library and The Show About Nothing. The Comedian Joe Bor was great, and the drag queen was a spectacular singer. I normally don't love cruise entertainment but Virgin hit it out the park. 

THE DINING 
The dining experiences felt good overall, but some were better than others. 
A few favorites: 
-I loved Extra Virgin - the dishes were restaurant quality, especially the pasta. 
-The Wake was also very good, for both brunch and dinner. The bread was amazing, as was the creamed spinach and potato. The steak wasn't restaurant quality unfortunately. 
-The Pizza Place had amazing neapolitan pizzas - my favorite food on the ship.
-Razzle Dazzle was mixed. I loved the fried chicken style cauliflower though. 

Some not so greats: 
-Lick me til Ice Cream - the gelato was meh, both in flavor and consistency. 
-Room service, which was an additional cost, was not great. Not all of our items were delivered, and the drip coffee was terrible. 
- The food at the galley was meh; I didn't find much that I loved. The desserts were good, though! 

THE CRUISE PORTS
I appreciated that some of the ports were destinations in and of themselves - not just tailored for cruise ships. Santorini and Mykonos were fantastic. Rhodes and Bodrum felt like cruise ports with the usual cheap shopping and not much else - nothing spectacular. 
My husband and I particularly appreciated the overnight stay in Mykonos, as it gave us an opportunity to have a local dinner on the island and take our time getting back on the ship. 

THE ROOM 
The room felt modern and sufficiently roomy for 2 adults. I appreciated the size of the shower, and the hammock chair was amazing. The tablet/tech features of the room were super buggy, but I appreciated that they had tried. 
Our cabin door wouldn't close unless we slammed it, and there were stains on the carpet, which took away some of the sparkle. 
Unfortunately there were no electrical outlets in the bathroom. Although the room had sufficient outlets overall. 
The mattress was pretty firm, but comfortable enough. 

VIRGIN VIBES 
The cruise felt tailored for adults, and a little ""naughty"" at times, which was fun. 
I loved that we were given bracelets with ability to pay and disembark/embark - it was so easy. 
I didn't try the gym or exercise classes, but the area seemed great. 
I loved the pool area - there were day beds around the pool in addition to standard lounge chairs, and they were super comfy. 

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
- My husband had an allergic reaction (cashews) at one of the restaurants. his allergy was on his profile and we mentioned it at the restaurant. When we told our server of the reaction, he apologized and said it was a ""busy night"" and offered other excuses, which naturally infuriated me. I ended up speaking with the manager, who was apologetic and sent a bottle of bubbly to our room. The experience dampened the night for us.
- The espresso-based, made to order drinks should be included in the price, considering the price per night. 
- More information prior to embarking would have been useful - particularly about booking tenders 
- It would have been nice if more Mediterranean (particularly Greek) food would have been offered, to help us feel connected to the locations we were visiting. Despite being in the beautiful Aegean sea, while on the ship we felt like we were back in the US. 

WORTH THE PRICE? 
Hmm, this is tough. For the price we paid, I'm not sure, especially because most days we were in ports and not on the ship. 

Hope you found this review informative and useful :)

It’s not just about skipping meals — it’s about reprogramming your metabolism, hormones, and cellular repair systems through strategic fasting windows.

Different fasting styles activate slightly different biological mechanisms, so choosing the *right* method depends on your goals: fat loss, focus, longevity, or metabolic flexibility.

Let’s break down the most popular fasting styles — and what the data actually says about each 👇

# 🕗 1. The 16:8 Method — The Everyday Fast

**16 hours fasting / 8 hours eating window**

**How it works:**  
You fast for 16 hours (usually overnight) and eat all your meals within an 8-hour window — for example, 12 PM–8 PM.

**Best for:**

* Beginners starting their fasting journey
* Improving insulin sensitivity & metabolic flexibility
* Maintaining lean mass while cutting fat

**Pros:**  
✅ Easy to sustain long-term  
✅ Promotes mild autophagy & steady energy  
✅ Pairs well with workout routines

**Cons:**  
❌ Less impact on deep cellular repair than longer fasts  
❌ May not fully reset hunger hormones in some individuals

# 🍽️ 2. OMAD — One Meal A Day

**23 hours fasting / 1 meal feeding window**

**How it works:**  
You consume all your calories in one sitting, usually in the evening, then fast until the same time the next day.

**Best for:**

* Advanced fasters
* Those focused on fat loss & mental clarity
* Simplifying meal prep and calorie control

**Pros:**  
✅ Massive calorie control  
✅ Extended autophagy and HGH release  
✅ Heightened focus due to ketone elevation

**Cons:**  
❌ Difficult to meet protein/micronutrient needs  
❌ Potential for overeating or digestive strain  
❌ Not ideal for athletes or those with high energy demands

# 🧬 3. 5:2 Fasting — The Weekly Reset

**5 days normal eating / 2 non-consecutive fasting days per week**

**How it works:**  
Eat normally for five days, then restrict calories to around 500–600 on two separate days (e.g., Monday & Thursday).

**Best for:**

* Longevity-focused individuals
* People needing flexibility
* Beginners not ready for daily fasting

**Pros:**  
✅ Stimulates autophagy & metabolic adaptation  
✅ Improves insulin sensitivity & cellular resilience  
✅ Fits easily into most lifestyles

**Cons:**  
❌ Inconsistent hunger on fasting days  
❌ Results can vary if “normal” eating days are unbalanced

# 🔁 4. Alternate-Day Fasting (ADF)

**Fast every other day (0–25% calories on fast days)**

**How it works:**  
You alternate between eating normally one day and fasting (or minimal calorie intake) the next.

**Best for:**

* Rapid fat loss
* Metabolic repair & insulin reset
* Deep autophagy and longevity effects

**Pros:**  
✅ Strong evidence for longevity & cellular rejuvenation  
✅ Deep ketone production & fat oxidation  
✅ Improves lipid markers and blood pressure

**Cons:**  
❌ Difficult to sustain long-term  
❌ May disrupt sleep or hormones if overused  
❌ Not recommended for new fasters or high-stress individuals

# ⚖️ Choosing the Right Fasting Style for Your Goals

|Goal|Best Fasting Style|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Fat Loss & Focus**|16:8 or OMAD|Stable energy, easy adherence|
|**Longevity & Autophagy**|ADF or 5:2|Triggers deeper repair mechanisms|
|**Simplicity & Habit Building**|16:8|Most sustainable for daily life|
|**Metabolic Reset**|ADF|Best for insulin resistance reversal|

# 🔬 Pro Tips for Optimized Fasting

* **Hydrate:** Use electrolytes or mineral water during fasts.
* **Caffeine smartly:** Black coffee and green tea enhance fat oxidation.
* **Track biomarkers:** Use a CGM or ketone meter for real feedback.
* **Ease in:** Start with 12-hour fasts and increase duration gradually.
* **Refeed clean:** Break fasts with protein, fiber, and healthy fats — avoid sugar spikes.

# 💬 Community Discussion

* What fasting style are you currently experimenting with?
* Have you compared biomarker data between different fasting methods?
* How do you handle energy levels, sleep, and workouts while fasting?

Share your logs, results, or CGM screenshots — let’s quantify fasting together.

# ⏱️ Fast smarter. Recover deeper. Evolve metabolically.

**ABOUT ME:**

Hey, I'm Jordan - 31 years old, male, straight, born and raised in the UK 🇬🇧. I work full-time as an electronics product tester (yes, it’s as cool as it sounds, ask me anything about it). I’m a bit of a notification addict, so I reply fast. Right now I’m on a health kick and making big lifestyle changes to match, already dropped down 16kg / 35lbs! 

---

**HOBBIES:**

Gaming is my go-to hobby and what I spend most of my free time doing. Primarily a PC gamer, but also own a Switch 2 (and Steam Deck!) Currently playing PowerWash Simulator 2 and BALL x PIT - I have a vast library of games across Steam and Switch, plus whatever is on Gamepass. I'm open to playing most games, especially co-op titles but actively **avoid** playing MMOs, MOBAs or any competitive shooters. Perhaps you could suggest a game we might enjoy together?

As of late I'm looking into cross stitching as I think it's a really neat form of art! I'd love to get started and start making some Kirby themed designs via Esty kits I've seen online - anyone with experience, send me your beginner tips!!

Besides games, I love to watch TV and movies (especially streaming them to other people and watching together) - not so much a big music fan, but I do have a single playlist on Spotify where I dump all my favourite songs on there lmao

---

**SOCIALIZING:**

I’m a people person and always up for getting to know someone on a deeper level. I'm looking for a kind of platonic energy that has slipped through my fingers in the past - someone who's enjoy daily conversation, exchanging photos and voice notes and generally interested in conversation, rather than just replying to messages. Huge fan of voice calls and would much rather sit in a call together than texting. My social battery can vary from day to day, from being incredibly responsive to complete potato mode - unless I'm asleep, I'm always readily available (even at work!) 

***I'm usually available for voice calls / games in the evenings (9pm onwards GMT) or weekend mornings (8am - 4pm GMT), but otherwise I can text anytime!***

---

**RANDOM TIDBITS:**

Been lucky enough to travel around the world to places like Tokyo, California (x7) and Prague! I currently have two tattoos on my shoulder and my wrist (pics for the cool kids), serial picky eater (way worse than you think...) and I've even met THREE other users from Reddit IRL (all still alive, promise!)

Luke is sitting at a small, square wooden table next to the cafe’s large windows. He is looking down at his coffee when he hears the bell ring of the cafe door opening. He looks up and sees his brother, David.

“You’re here,” says Luke with a soft smile.  
  
“Sorry I took so long,” replied David.  
  
“No, no. I’m glad you took your time.”

The cafe is empty, save for a few others the barista knows by name. They must be regulars. The espresso machine whirs and the steamer makes a subtle grinding sound, suggesting burnt milk. David notices and smirks to himself.

“Are you ready?” asked Luked. David nods and they walk to the back of the cafe, where two faux leather recliners sit facing a wall, separated by a circular table that is level with the arm rests. On the wall in front of the chairs is a large projector screen and behind the chairs sits a tall, old film projector. Neither Luke nor David recognize the brand name of the projector as they walk by to take their seats.  
  
“I’m surprised anyone still uses real film these days,” says David.  
  
“Yeah, no kidding. I appreciate the art of it, though,” replies Luke. He catches the barista’s eye and waves her over. She smiles in acknowledgment and finishes making the next drink. She then walks over to the south wall of the cafe. It is covered in shelves filled with movie film, all contained in metal, flat, circular drums. She climbs the sliding ladder and grabs one off the top shelf.  
  
“It’s funny,” she says. “We keep all the new stuff near the top because most of our regulars prefer the classics.” She climbs down the ladder, walks over to the projector, and loads the film. “Anyway, enjoy.” She presses play and walks back to the counter. Light bursts from the projector onto the screen, starting with the black and white countdown and soft beeps typical of old films.

**Scene One**

The first scene opens to a living room in a modest single-family home. The furniture has been rearranged to make space for a fake Christmas tree in the corner. The room is filled by its cascading lights reflecting off the red and white decorations. There is a large box with perforated holes under the tree, wrapped in cardboard paper and twine. The rising sun warms the room, melting the snowstick off the window corners. Two boys wake from the smell of hot chocolate and they race downstairs shouting, \*Did Santa come?\* Seeing the gifts under the tree, they cheer in unison. \*He did! He did!\*  
  
Looking away from the screen for a moment, David asks, “A little early for a Christmas movie, eh?”  
  
“Come on, who doesn’t love Christmas?” says Luke.

The boys’ parents join them in the living room and their mother offers them cups of warm cocoa, while their father stays behind and turns to pour something in his mug. The mother looks back at the father just in time to see him hide a small bottle in his jacket pocket. She quickly turns back to the boys and asks who’s ready to open their presents. *I am*, they both cheer. She tells them the big one is for them both to share and to be extra careful opening it. The boys look at each other, unable to contain their grins, and rush to the tree. *Be careful,* warns their mother. The boys summon the totality of their willpower to gently open the large box. Within it, they find a small, sleeping puppy barely two months old. It wakes and rubs its paws across its face, then ambles over to the boys, collapsing in the younger boy’s lap. They notice a diamond-shaped spot on his forehead and name him Lucky.

**Scene Two**

The next scene cuts to a community pool in a small town. A lifeguard shouts at the two boys as they are chased around the pool by their young dog. Their father walks over, stumbling a bit, and yanks Lucky’s leash so hard that it yelps. *Act right or we’re going home*, he says to the boys. With heads lowered, they walk to the shallow fountain area to put some distance between themselves and their father. The sulking does not last long, however, and they are soon playing with the other kids unburdened by the freedoms of summer. The older boy tells the younger that he is going to pee and not to go anywhere. Growing bored and aimless in minutes, which to a the younger boy was days, he wanders over to the tall slide that welcomed swimmers to the deep end. Unable to read, unable to swim, and unaware of the depths in front of him, the younger boy climbs the slide, excited to emulate the fun everyone else was having. A moment of joy quickly shifts to inexplicable fear as the young boy slides and sinks into what might as well have been an ocean, surrounded by endless shades of blue. He looks up and sees a million tiny flashlights twinkling around him. The flashlights start turning off, first in his periphery then closing in. It goes dark. He hears barking. *Dad, wake up! Wake up!* A splash.

The younger boy wakes, coughing up chlorine-flavored water, with the lifeguard kneeling over him. His older brother stands next to them, soaking wet and panting. *You’ve got a good brother, kid,* says the lifeguard. Lucky breaks out of the sleeping father’s hand and runs over to the younger boy, licking his face. The older boy says he heard Lucky barking and ran outside seconds after the younger boy hit the water. 

“Good boy!” says Luke.

“How embarrassing for that kid. He should’ve known better,” says David.

“Eh, kids are kids. I don’t think it’s fair to blame them for their parents’ misgivings.”

The boys wake their father and ask to go home. The father sits up, grabs his shirt, and several small glass bottles fall to the ground and shatter.

**Scene Three**

The boys, now teenagers, wake to the sound of their father’s car driving through trash cans and mailboxes. The car parks halfway in the lawn, unaware of the trail of debris left in its wake. Their father falls out of the driver seat and makes his way to the front door, leaning a shoulder and his forehead into it while he fumbles for his keys. He finally finds the keyhole and opens the door, but his oldest son is standing in the doorway. \*Dad, you need to leave. Don’t come back till you’re sober. You need to start ac…\* The older boy does not see his father’s fist until it connects with his jaw. He collapses, head still ringing from the sheer force. His father is on top of him now, hands wrapped around his son’s throat, saying things no child should ever hear. The younger boy pleads for their father to stop. He does not. Their mother is screaming, but does not move. As the light starts to leave the older boy's eyes, the younger grabs a heavy iron picture frame and swings it at his father’s head. It connects with his temple and he goes limp. Shards of glass sprinkle around him. The older boy gasps for air while the younger looks at the photo in the frame. It was the last photo they took of Lucky before he passed. They hear sirens approaching in the distance.

**Intermission**

The film runs out and the screen goes white. The barista walks over and prepares the next film canister.

“Oof. Kinda heavy for the beginning. Just curious, who directed this?” asked David to the barista.

“I’m glad you asked. He’s actually upstairs. You can meet him when the movie is over. But if you thought that was heavy, just wait for the second half. It gets pretty rough. The runtime’s a little longer, too. Can I get you boys another drink?”

“Water’s fine,” says Luke.

“Same,” says David.

The barista goes back to the counter and fills up two glasses from the tap.

“It’s been so long since I’ve seen this one,” says Luke. “I guess I forgot some of the details.”  
  
“Yeah, same. Do we have to watch the next part? We could do something else instead,” replied David.  
  
“No. Let’s go ahead and finish it. My favorite part is coming up soon.”

The barista walks back and sets the glasses on the circular table between the brothers, along with a bag of popcorn.

“On the house,” she says with a wink, then presses play.

**Scene Four**

The next scene begins immediately without countdowns or beeps. Two young men are standing next to a grill, barbecuing hot dogs, brats, and burgers. The older of the two is wearing a loose t-shirt and an apron that says \*World’s Best Dad\*. His hair is messy and his face is still boasting yesterday’s five o’clock shadow. The younger is abnormally lean, but taller than the older. He wears a baggy zippered hoodie with cigarette burns peppering the edges, the cuffs of the sleeves fraying. They’re both smiling, laughing, joking while orange and brown leaves are suspended around them by a gentle breeze.  
  
“I really like this part,” says Luke.

A young girl runs onto the patio, carrying a stuffed lion in one arm and tugging her father’s apron with the other. She asks if lunch is ready yet. He tells her 10 more minutes and she reminds her father that she has literally been waiting forever. The younger man says he just remembered he brought some snacks. The young girl lights up and trots over to her uncle. He wraps an arm around her and lightly digs a knuckle into her head, messing up her braided hair. *No, not a knuckle sandwich*, she giggles. *Sorry bug, I had to,* laughs the younger.

“Reminds me of someone who used to give me knuckle sandwiches all the time,” interrupts David, side-eyeing Luke. Luke smiles back.  
  
The older man’s wife steps out on the patio carrying a pitcher of lemonade and rolled up napkins. After they set the table, they enjoy a meal together with quiet conversation as the sun breaks through the overcast and wraps the family in a pleasant warmth. The younger, taller man excuses himself to use the restroom and steps inside. Several minutes pass. The older man, still sitting on the patio, lets his attention drift. He turns and looks into the living room through the kitchen window. He sees his brother there, opening cabinets and drawers. In a blink, a yellow, shining band floats out of a drawer and into his younger brother’s frayed hoodie. Before the younger brother leaves later that evening, the older asks him if he’s doing okay. If he needs anything. The younger brother says he is fine and not to worry. Later that night, the older brother is washing the accumulated dishes of the day when his wife calls down to him. \*Honey, have you seen my gold watch?\* He says no. The scene fades to black.  
  
“I don’t think I want to watch this anymore,” says David. He starts to get up, but the barista is standing next to him.  
  
“You can stop, but there are no refunds,” she says.  
  
“Can we watch anything else?” asks David.  
  
“This is the movie you chose. This is the movie you’ll watch,” says the barista.  
  
“It’s okay, David. We’ll finish it together,” says Luke. David sits down and looks uncomfortable. The next scene starts.

**Scene Five**

*He’s my brother.* I’m just going to set him up in a hotel for a few days. The older brother argues with his wife. She wants him to stay home, to solve this tomorrow. She has a sinking feeling in her chest. His daughter comes downstairs and is a foot taller than in the last scene. She sees her father is dressed with keys in hand, but it is late and she asks where he is going. \*I’ll be home in a couple hours, sweetie.\* He gives his wife and daughter a hug and kiss, then steps out the door.  
  
The older brother parks the car in front of a home on a street with broken streetlights, unkept lawns, and wire fences. The house in front of him used to be navy, but the paint had discolored and chipped away into a disturbing mosaic of endless shades of blue. The older brother thinks to himself, \*It’s like he’s drowning again.\*   
  
Back at the cafe, David’s eyes are glued to the screen. “Don’t go in there. Go home,” he says. His eyes start to water.

The older brother walks up to the porch and the door is ajar. He does not knock and nudges it open, looking left and right for signs of life. He steps into the living room and sees a taller, younger man sprawled facedown on the couch. On the coffee table next to him, there is warped foil, lighters, and several open bags of generic-brand chips. He kneels down and lightly shakes his brother, who starts to wake. As the younger, taller man comes to, he sees his older brother and tells him to leave. That he shouldn’t be here. That he needs to go now. The older brother refuses. *What are you talking about? Come on, man. Let’s get out of here.* Bright headlights flood in through the window. 

A truck pulls into the driveway of the crumbling home and three men jump out. They storm up to the home, kicking open the already open door. They do not acknowledge the older brother and demand money from the younger. \*Hey man, listen, just give me to the end of the week. I’m good for it,\* says the younger. \*You’ve had enough time\*, says the strangers.The older brother steps between them and asks how much his younger brother owes, opening his wallet and exposing crumbled bills. The three men laugh and snatch the wallet. \*Okay, we’re good then.\* \*We’re leaving\*, says the older. The three strangers block the brothers. They demand more, the lead stranger pulling out a black pistol. The other two behind him shift uncomfortably. The lead stranger demands the older’s wedding ring and car keys. He says no and attempts to walk through the men, dragging the younger brother by his arm, who is cowering behind him. \*There’s no need for anyone to do something they’ll regret\*, says the older brother. \*Let us go.\* The brothers try to step past the strangers, but are blocked. The collision of men sparks a struggle, the two brothers doing their best to push the intruders out of their way. A cacophony of shouts and shuffling feet fill the room, until a loud bang stops time. 

The three strangers freeze, then run out the front door. The younger, taller brother looks down and sees his older brother laying in a pool of blood, coughing up more on his shirt. The younger brother cries out, falls to his knees, and holds his older brother in his arms as the light leaves his eyes.

As the scene ends, David is sobbing. “He doesn’t deserve him,” he says, shaking in his faux leather chair.  
  
Luke grabs David’s arm. “It wasn’t his fault, David. It’s not his fault,” says Luke. The cafe is silent and the screen goes black for several minutes.

As

**Scene Six**

A doctor walks into the hospital room. *He’s going to live, but he’ll never walk again.* A wife and daughter cry tears of relief at the bedside of the older.

**Scene Seven**

A new scene begins, and the younger brother wakes from his digital alarm. The sun has not yet risen, but he turns and plants his feet on the floor. He turns on his lamp, which reveals a simple, clean apartment and a young man who is not so young anymore. His hair and beard, once a rich brunette, are now brushed with streaks of gray. He turns on his coffee machine, takes a cold shower, and gets dressed. A rich, acidic aroma fills the small apartment and the younger, taller brother pours himself a cup of slightly burnt coffee. He grabs his keys off the hook by the front door, resting below the only photo in the apartment; a photo of two young boys at a small community pool. Quietly, he makes his way to work at a small bakery nearby. Usually he drives, but on this cold, dark morning, he decides to walk. As he opens the shop, he checks his phone and sees another unheard voicemail from his older brother, but he locks his phone and puts it away.  
  
The scene shifts. There is a middle-aged man in a wheelchair who just finished leaving a voicemail on his younger brother’s phone. \*…Anyway, I hope you’re doing well. Bug’s been asking about you. Give me a call back when you can.\* He hangs up, and rolls back to the bleachers, where his wife is waiting. On the field in front of them, a young girl in a pony tail receives a kick-off from the opposing team. The parents cheer, \*Come on, Bug!\*

**Scene Eight**

Two lives move in parallel, never intersecting. The younger brother continues working at a bakery, rising in rank from baker, to manager, and eventually takes out a small business loan to open his own bakery. The older brother continues sharing meals with his wife and daughter, belly laughing at stories they tell each other, and cheering for his daughter at a series of graduations, all the while dismissing sporadic coughing fits. Both brothers wonder and worry about the other.

Ten years pass. 

A tired, older brother sits in the office of his home and calls his younger brother.

*David, it’s Luke. I’ve got some bad news that I’ve wanted to tell you for a while. I hoped I could do it in person, but you still won’t answer the phone, so here it is. I have cancer. And it's terminal. We thought the treatment worked, but it came back. I’m dying, David. The doctors say I’ve only got a few months left. I want to see you before I’m gone. This Sunday, I’m going to be at the bench on the south side of Smith Lake. Will you meet me there?*

Sunday arrives. The older brother sits in his wheelchair, staring at a mother duck leading her ducklings along the shore of the lake. The coffee in his lap has settled to room temperature and he finds himself reflecting on how much he loves his wife and how proud he is of his daughter. After waiting for some time, he is discouraged and starts to leave, but a voice appears behind him. *Hey, where ya going?!* The older brother turns his chair and sees his younger brother jogging over. Both men look worn by time, but this does not stifle the joy and relief on their faces when the younger brother leans over with a hug that lasts an eternity. *I’m sorry, I just thought… I should’ve called, but…,* the younger brother chokes on his words. Luke interrupts his younger brother. *Better late than never.*

**Scene Nine**

The final scene begins. An old man knocks on the front door of a modest, single-family home with a box of baked goods labeled \*Brothers Bakery\* under one arm and a large box with perforated holes held in the other. A young woman answers and smiles. \*Hey Bug,\* says the old man. He puts the large box and the baked goods down and gives her a hug. \*Oh, I’m so glad you’re here. Boys! Uncle David is here!\* The taller, younger brother, now an old man, picks up the boxes, slightly raising the big one and says, \*Are you sure this is okay?\* The young woman replies, \*Oh my gosh, yes. They’re going to love it.\* They both step into the living room, which is decorated with a real evergreen tree wrapped in cascading lights that reflect off gold and blue decorations. The young woman goes to the kitchen and returns arm-and-arm with her husband, a cup of hot chocolate, and two young boys. She hands the hot chocolate to David and the young boys say \*Merry Christmas, Uncle David!\*  
  
The family sits and takes turns opening presents and sipping hot chocolate until only the large box with perforated holes remains. \*Okay boys, the big one is for you. But be very careful when you open it.\* The two boys rush to the final gift and do their best to restrain themselves. They lift the cover of the large box with perforated holes, and in it is a small puppy only a few months old. The puppy jumps out of the box and starts licking the boys. While the boys cheer and laugh, the young woman hands David a small rectangular gift wrapped in red-and-white striped paper. \*I found this a while back when I was going through Dad’s stuff. I thought you might want it,\* said the young woman. David opens the box and sees a photo of two old men; a taller, younger one smiling while tending to a grill and the older sitting in a wheel chair with his head thrown back in laughter.

**Back at the Cafe**

The movie runs out of film and the screen turns white. The barista walks over, turns off the projector, and says, “I’ll give you boys a couple minutes.” The boys are quiet for a moment before one speaks.

“Thanks for keeping an eye on them while I was gone,” says Luke.

“It would’ve been better if you were there. I’m sorry I didn’t reach out sooner. I hated myself for so long. I didn’t want to be a burden,” replied David.

“David, you were never a burden. In my eyes, this movie had a happy ending. My family had an amazing life together. And it was even more amazing with you there at the end. I feel blessed to have had what we did — not many people get that.”

David takes a deep breath and sighs. He remembers a quote that he carried with him in those final decades. “There is no time for hate. There is only time for love, and for that, only a moment.” He looks down, then over at his older brother. “I love you, Luke. Thank you for never giving up on me.”

“Of course,” says the older brother. “So… what now?”

The barista walks back towards the boys and moves to open a wooden door with a brass handle in the wall to their right.

“Wait, was that there a second ago?” asked David. Luke shrugs, unsure himself.

The barista is smiling. “I think there’s someone here to see you.” She opens the door and they see stairs going to an upper story. A barking dog with a diamond-shaped spot on its forehead rushes down the stairs and jumps at the boys, tail wagging.

“Lucky!” both brothers cheer. After a few minutes of play, the dog runs back to the stairs. It turns and barks at the brothers, then runs up.

“We’ve gotta prep the next movie, boys. It’s time for you to go,” says the barista, waving towards the stairway.

“What’s up there?” asks Luke.

“You get to meet the director,” she says.

The brothers take one last look at each other, then move to the stairs. They ascend together. ",1,1761779413.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

I'm not sure what I am going to write about, but you know what let's call it a life update or something like that, recently life has been weird, I wanted to say Difficult but I don't think that word appropriately describe my situation here, so it's 4 am here and I'm drinking my sleep solution, which I wont have to most likely if I won't have had taken coffee in the evening but again I had to work ,i was not focused in the evening so I had to drink coffee, weird right, again it's 4 am and if I sleep 9 hrs i won't be waking up before 1 pm so again half of my day is gone, so again I won't be able to buy medicine from the cheap medicine shop and I won't be buying spinach too because I would be waking up in afternoon and lunch would have already been prepared and because I won't be much hungry so I won't be making any breakfast either for myself even though recently I've realised that I have started to dislike th food I am eating these days, it's not upto my taste, most of the times it tastes like crap, but since my appetite isn't quite good these days so I am also not in the mood to cook too , 
i just want to exit out of this vicious cycle but nowadays i don't find the exit, i don't feel like cooking in afternoon or in evening or in night as well because since i am eating my breakfast and lunch late i feel full throughout the day ,            

apart from this , I everyday tell myself once y cold gets better I'll start to lift weights again but my cold is getting better but it's not going completely and since I am waking up late i just don't feel like going to lift weights, i just have my breakfast and strat scrolling Reddy until it's 6 pm and it's time for my work 
            
yesterday I had to walk like 2-3 kms and I got really breathless, it could be due to low stamina+ cold + due to regular smoking my lung capacity decreased, it just sucked and I was stressed because of that so guess what I did , i went for a cig again, i had no other choice       
         
my life sucks because there is no girl, but recently I've realised that girls are very different beings and they are not what we need them for girls are very complicated and irrational and they require lots of energy and maintenance and it will exhaust you physically and mentally keeping a girl , i recently met a friend and after hearing his sad story it felt like he was less troubled because of his job and more troubled with the girl related issues, and you know what I am a simple man , my philosophy is to avoid all troubles and if girls seem like trouble why would I approach them right, i want peace not chaos , so yeah my life still sucks because of no girl but honestly it sucks less than it would when there would have been a girl I'm sure           

let's see how things go from here onwards, honestly there are only 2 months left in this year and I'm so burnt out I'm not liking any new drama or anime, anything I try to watch feels off 
        
i always feel like taking a break but i don't really know what i will do when I'm on a break , Even gaming isn't feeling interesting, nothing is filling me up music too , only if I could just shut myself down for the winter and only wake up directly in the spring it would be so good , i really need a good long nap that just resets the connections inside my brain

So here's what happened. We've been married for six years. Things were good, or I thought they were. But about eight months ago I started feeling restless. Like I was missing out on something. I'm 29, he's 32, and we got together young. I started thinking about what it would be like to experience other people.

I didn't cheat. I want to make that clear. I brought it up to him one night after dinner. I said I wanted to explore being with other men but I still loved him and wanted our marriage. He could keep all the husband benefits. The house, the joint accounts, me coming home every night, everything.

He just stared at me. Then he asked, ""What does that even mean?""

I explained it. I said I needed freedom to see other people but I wasn't leaving him. He was still my husband. We'd still share our life together. I just needed this one thing.

He didn't yell. He didn't argue. He asked if I wanted him to see other people too.

I said no. I told him I wasn't comfortable with that. This was about me figuring myself out, not about us both dating around.

He nodded slowly. Then he said, ""So you want me to sit at home while you go out with other men. But I still pay half the mortgage and you still get to call yourself my wife.""

I said yes, basically. I mean, I wasn't trying to hurt him. I just wanted honesty instead of sneaking around.

He went quiet for the rest of the night. Slept in the guest room. The next morning he seemed normal. Made coffee, kissed my forehead, said he had some errands to run. I thought maybe he was coming around to the idea.

He never came home.

By 6pm I was texting him. No response. By 9pm I was calling. Straight to voicemail. By midnight I was freaking out. I checked our bank accounts on my phone.

Empty. Every single one. Checking, savings, the emergency fund we'd built up over six years. About $85,000 total, gone. Transferred out that morning.

I drove to his parents' house at 1am. His mom answered the door in her bathrobe, took one look at my face, and started laughing. Actually laughing. She called his dad to the door and said, ""She's here.""

His dad crossed his arms and said, ""He's not here and we're not telling you where he is.""

I started crying, begging them to tell me where he went. I said I didn't mean for this to happen, I just wanted to talk to him. His mom stopped laughing and her face went cold. She said, ""You wanted freedom. You got it. Now you're free to figure out how to pay your mortgage alone.""

They shut the door.

I went to his brother's house. His sister's apartment. His best friend's place. Nobody would tell me anything. A few of them looked at me like I was disgusting. His brother said, ""You've got some nerve showing up here,"" and closed the door before I could explain.

The next week was a nightmare. I had $300 in a separate account I used for coffee money. My paycheck wasn't due for another week. The mortgage was due in five days. I called a lawyer. He said technically my husband didn't do anything illegal since the accounts were joint, but I could file for emergency spousal support if I filed for separation.

I didn't want separation. I wanted him back.

Two weeks later I got served with divorce papers. He was claiming irreconcilable differences. His lawyer requested I buy out his half of the house or sell it. He wanted the money he put into our accounts returned to him, minus what he already took. He documented every major purchase we made in six years.

I had to move back in with my parents at 29. I couldn't afford the house alone. I couldn't even afford a decent apartment on my salary because I worked part-time at a nonprofit while he paid most of our bills.

The guy I was interested in, the one who kind of started this whole thing, ghosted me the second he found out I was getting divorced. Turns out he was only interested when I was safely married and unavailable.

My friends have been supportive but I can tell half of them think I'm an idiot. My parents are disappointed but letting me stay rent-free while I figure things out. His family won't speak to me. Mutual friends have taken sides and most picked him.

The divorce finalized last month. I had to agree to let him keep what he took from our accounts because fighting it would've cost more in legal fees than I'd get back. I'm working full-time now at a job I hate to afford my own place. I see him sometimes around town with his family. They look happy. He looks better than he did when we were married, honestly.

Part of me knows I screwed up. I wanted everything my way and didn't consider what I was asking him to accept. But another part of me thinks he overreacted. We could've talked it through. He didn't have to blow up our entire life.

So AITA for thinking my husband should've at least tried to work through this instead of disappearing and taking everything?

1ojjgt1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ojjgt1,Need help styling an awkward room,"Would love some help with this room!

It is a rental so the carpet can't change but we have some scope to update and change the furniture like the couch/chairs, coffee tables, the TV and the TV stand. 

Generally it's a large, awkward shape so we're not even sure where is good couch/TV placement at the moment. 

We'd also like to add bookshelves in the nook to the right of the window at some point, and possibly a WFH station/desk in the slot left of the window. 

The window is south facing so a real sun trap for most of the day. We have lots of plants not pictured. 

Any tips welcome, I'm overwhelmed with how much I currently don't like it so I'm struggling to know where to start. ",2,1761778819.0,StyleYourSpace,1,1.0,False
