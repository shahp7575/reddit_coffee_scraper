HESIT: 
this game mode involves 3 teams (Cops, Robbers, Hostages). Depending on the size of the map will determine the amount of players in the session. Average session will have about 24 players. (10 cops, 10 robbers, 4 hostages)
The goal of this game mode defers based on the role you are playing. 
The robbers have an objective to steal something and have to make a getaway. There are alternative ways to win as robbers by killing all cops. The robbers only have a basic idea about the object they‚Äôre stealing which is why they need a tech role on their team. The tech role in this case can map out the location and give you audio-visualization of where to go and how to approach the situation. The tech role is also capable of disabling elevators, alarms, lights, smoke alarms and sprinkles, and able to view CCTV. (This applies for both teams) 
The cops objective is to kill or detain all robbers and save the hostages. If the hostages all die the game will keep going as long as the robbers are still trying to complete their objective.
For every hostage saved the cops team gets more points. More points equals a higher payout at the end of the game (payouts are used to buy weapon camos, and in-game assistance) for every hostage killed the cops will not loose anything but the robbers will have less of a payout. 

In-game assistance varies based on the team. For the cops, this means you came buy a tech guy instead of having one of your 10 players be a tech guy. You could also use your payouts that you earned to bribe someone on the robber team to help make your entrance. The robber can accept payout (via wire transfer or tangible duffel bag) there is nothing stopping the robber from taking the payout and not holding his end of the bargain but the cops have to hold their end up if they robber takes the bride and cooperates.

Viewing a players profile you can see how many robberies they have committed successfully, how many hostages they have killed, their total time played, and total money earned. 

Viewing a players police profile you can see how many situations they have de-escalated, how many hostages they have saved, their total time played, and total money earned.

‚Ä¢A player that has killed 10 hostages within 24 hours will be labeled psycho.

‚Ä¢A player that has killed less than 10 hostages within 24 hours will be labeled scum 

‚Ä¢A player that has killed 0 hostages within 24 hours will be labeled minor threat 

‚Ä¢An officer that has stopped the robbers successfully without killing them 3 times within 24 hours will be label Hero 

‚Ä¢An officer that has stopped the robbers successfully by killing them more than 10 times within 24 hours will be labeled trigger happy 

‚Ä¢An officer that has not stopped any robberies within 24 hours will be labeled rookie 

‚Ä¢An officer that has killed 3 hostages within 24 hours will be labeled bad cop 

These labels given will help teams decide how the person they are up against/their teammates play the game. Would you trust a psycho or a trigger happy cop?

Planning the heist:
The robbers will start out all together in the parking garage. Before the match starts the ring leader will set the getaway vehicle‚Äôs location being in 1/32 parking spots on 1/8 floors of the parking garage. Once the vehicle is set, the map will generate vehicles all over the parking garage for better camouflage from the cops. It‚Äôs good not to forget the location of the getaway vehicle as there will be some vehicles that look like the getaway vehicle but are not. In this scenario the getaway vehicle will be a van and the map will be a 32 floor building with access to the roof, lobby, 8th floor, 28th floor, and 29th floor. The floors will be procedurally generated so every map will need a new scenario. For this map 1/5 of the floors will be a renovation floor with exposed wires and ceilings, Sheetrock, plastic sheets, and low power. 2/5 of these floors will be offices, 1/5 will be the lobby, and 1/5 will be an employee recreation center with a gym, food court, multiple break rooms and more. The 8th floor will connect to the parking garage as will the lobby. 

Tech role:
The tech role can stay in the van and hack into the building‚Äôs computer to be able to access elevators, lights, cctv, and more with the ability to leave the van anytime to join their team inside. Hacking the building from the van will mean being in a more secure location but will sacrifice hack speed for security. The tech role can also choose to initially go in with their team at start and find the buildings data room. This is a less secure location as the tech on the cops team will be able to show blueprints of the building and the exact location of the data room. Being in the data room will give you more access to things such as engaging magnetic locks, faster hack speed, and longer elevator down time. (1 minute down time in data room as opposed to 30 second downtime in getaway van) 
The tech role will also carry a pocket computer that they can use at any given time to view CCTV footage, hack magnetic locks they are close too, and monitor motion sensors that the Tech or his team places down.
The tech role will be in charge of security for their team and also be a verbal guide to the location of the heist object.
(The team can still operate without a tech if they die or leave the game but will have to find their object based on other factors like hostages, general knowledge of the item, and photos of the object they all posses) 

Hostage:
The hostages will each spawn in different locations and before the game starts not be able to communicate. This makes the    
Fake Hostage role easier to manipulate and blend in with the other hostages. The hostages may spawn in as 2/4 office workers and 2/4 construction guys (on the renovation floor). The hostages can use items in the environment for their benefit and even be able to find a gun in some desks/the security office. A hostage may spawn in with a knife, or may spawn in with a concealed carry. It is completely random. 2/4 of the hostages know the location of the item the robbers are trying to steal and the other 2 will have easy access to the location. (Safe code, keys, keycard, voice recognition) 
There is nothing stopping the hostages from rebelling, cooperating, or trying to escape.

Fake Hostage:
The fake hostage is a role the robbers can select for 1 of their teammates. This role, the Fake Hostage will spawn with the hostages looking like them. He will only have zip ties, and a concealed handgun at start but will have the option at the beginning of the match to purchase a weapon that will be stored somewhere in the building with their earned payout (he will be given the location at the start of the match). The Fake hostage could also depend on one of their teammates to carry a duffel bag in with all of their gear. (This will slow the one carrying the duffel bag down)
The hostages will know there are only 4 of them but will have no way telling who the fake hostage is if they notice there is an extra person. 

The Getaway:
The getaway will be different for each map. In this map I explained, there are multiple options for a getaway. The robbers can use their payout together to purchase a helicopter getaway, they could make their way to the getaway vehicle, they could exit the rear maintenance door, or even exit the front door. 

Police planning:
At the start of the match the cops will get a basic idea of the building‚Äôs layout from their Tech‚Äôs blueprints. They will have no knowledge of the item the robbers are trying to steal and where it‚Äôs location is. 
The cops can use their payout to purchase a helicopter ride to the roof, and repel to floors 28 and 29 or take the service elevator down to any of the accessible floors.
If a robber see‚Äôs a steel cable used by police to repel, they can break the window and use cutters if equipped to cut the cable. The cops repelling can only use their side arm while repelling.
The cops can also use their payout to purchase a MCC before the start of the match (Mobile command center). The MCC will be a hub for the cop‚Äôs Tech role and will be the equivalent to the the data room in the building. Here, the cop‚Äôs tech role can view CCTV, disable alarms, engage magnetic locks, engage elevators, and more on multiple screens.
Without purchasing the MCC the cop‚Äôs tech role will only have a tent to use with 1 screen to monitor and limited features. hack speed in the MCC is equivalent to the data room and hack speed in the tent is equivalent to the getaway vehicle.
At the start The cops will decide their method of engagement by either splitting up or staying together. They can go in through the parking garage, lobby, rear maintenance door, or use the helicopter to access the roof at start. (The helicopter will only be able to support 4 passengers)


Cooperation: 
The police chief role will have access to a cellphone and the ring leader will also have access to a cellphone. This is how negotiations can be handled and communication can be accomplished.
EX: robbers say if anyone comes in a hostage will die 
EX: police offer a clue to the object they are trying to steal in exchange for a hostage
If a robber decides to turn on their team, they must first find access to communicate with the chief. This can be done by using the ringleaders phone or finding a phone around the map and dialing 911.
If a robber turns himself in, he may be entitled to a guaranteed payout whereas if the robbers loose they get no payout. 
If all robbers turn themselves in they do not get any payout and their payout from the job will go to the hostages. 
A robber can request items from the cops in exchange for things.
EX: give us your more detailed blueprint 
in exchange for 1 hostage 
EX: give me $10,000 and I‚Äôll release 1 hostage 
EX: give me assurance of my payout and I‚Äôll tell you the Tech‚Äôs location 
As a cop, by agreeing to any of these exchanges you know that the robber could be bluffing so decide carefully.



Loosing:
If all cops die, the robbers will win the game automatically and be given a payout. The remaining hostages will also be granted the payout the cops were supposed to get.
If all robbers die, the cops automatically win. The remaining hostages will be granted the payout the robbers we‚Äôre supposed to get.
If all hostages die, the game is not over but the hostages will be granted a payout still.
Once a cop dies, they will be in a precinct where they can throw doughnuts and coffee around, play cards, and watch the ‚Äúlive news‚Äù of the heist.
Once a robber dies, they will be in a jail cell where they can carve into the walls, watch the ‚Äúlive news‚Äù, and play cards.
Once a hostage dies they will be in the precinct as witnesses, able to do everything the cops can do.


Winning:
‚Ä¢The way to win the game as the robbers is to find the target object and successfully escape. This means even if they have to kill hostages and cops. If they kill all hostages, they loose leverage, if they kill all cops they automatically win.
‚Ä¢The way to win the game as the cops is to kill or detain all of the robbers. Saving the hostages will equal a higher payout. The more hostages saved, the higher the payout.





Map manipulation:

There are multiple ways to manipulate your environment to cause distractions and chaos.

Chaos for cops means the robbers will stress more, chaos for robbers mean the cops will be confused.

Ex: using a lighter to ignite a fire.

Once a fire has been ignited, the fire will slowly spread as long as the sprinklers are turned off. Once a fire starts to spread, the floor will slowly fill up with smoke causing players to have to crawl to safety so they don‚Äôt loose health. Major smoke inhalation means a players stamina will not regenerate for the remainder of the game unless they are taken to a medical tent (cops) or find a medical kit (robbers) be careful as there are only so many medical kits for the robbers to use. The cops can use the medic tent as many times as possible but may have to wait for more supplies to arrive if used to many times.













Swat:
The swat team will have access to multiple loadouts and equipment. 
Standard equipment includes:
‚Ä¢Radio
‚Ä¢Zip ties 
‚Ä¢primary 
‚Ä¢secondary 





HEIST MAPS
1. Gas station & liquor store 
2. Office building 
3. Large Bank
4. Armory 


WARRANT: CAPTURE MAPS
1. Apartment complex 
2. Fortified ‚Äúcult‚Äù farm



Black Market/ Dark Web
This is your hub to buy and sell stolen goods from other players. This hub is also the place where you buy your equipment and gear for future heists. This can be a great way to generate money, or to unload some of your inventory to make room for better/more needed items. 



Here, you can list items you have stolen for whatever price you want. Some items you steal may be classified as rare and will be likely to sell for whatever number you list it for. Other items will be classified as common and will have a harder time fetching a higher bid. In the future we may introduce limited legendary items. These will be a limited run item and will be well sought after




Example 
1 case of 9mm (500rds)


More about Dark Web/Black Market:
Heists are a great way to make money, but they aren‚Äôt there just for the money. 
Example: 1 heist map will be an Armory. There‚Äôs very little money to be stolen from there but there‚Äôs plenty of ammunition, armor, and weapons. And those are the type of items that will sell for the most money on the Black Market. 
Example 2: Another map will be a Gas station liquor store combo. This map is the very first map the player plays as a robber. There‚Äôs a decent bit of money, it‚Äôs very fast paced, and there‚Äôs lots of different types of loot to be stolen to use/sell. You can steal liquor bottles to make Molotov cocktails, or steal them to sell to other players so they can make them. You can use them as alcohol to disinfect before using a bandage (this would make healing slightly faster) 
If you find the clerk‚Äôs weapon you can steal it and also sell it. A cool feature for weapons will be you are able to track it down and find out who stole the weapon. It doesn‚Äôt do anything and is useless but is cool to see how many times a weapon was cycled through the Black Market and how many kills the weapon has.




Warrant: Capture 

This game mode consists of 2 teams. Cops and robbers. The idea of this game mode is for the officers to capture one of the players. For this game mode I will explain it using a map idea that Is an apartment complex. 
The game mode starts and all of the robbers spawn scattered across the map. The robbers don‚Äôt know who has the warrant but the cops do. The cops have to use photographs to ID the suspect and then take him to jail. The suspect has to avoid being caught and try and escape. There will be various escape points throughout the map but the escape points are usually infested with cops and you cannot escape in the sight of a cop. If the cops leave an escape point unattended, the robber will be notified via a marker on his map. 


Game mechanics 

We‚Äôve all played a shooting game before. You get shot a few times before you die or run away to regenerate health. Well in this game, the mechanics are a bit different. Since it‚Äôs a strategy game before a shooting game, you can decide if you want to go in guns blazing but there are risks to everything you do. If you get shot in vital areas, you are required to place your hands over the wound to stop bleeding. You can depend on your team to pull you to safety, you can crawl/move to safety, or you can wait for a med kit to be administered to you. If you get shot in the legs, your movement will slow down. If you get shot too many times in the legs, you will fall and be required to crawl. Anyplace you‚Äôve been shot without body armor will cause bleeding. If you bleed too much your stamina will decrease, but before that you‚Äôll get an instant adrenaline effect that will make you faster before the effect goes away. To stop bleeding, apply bandages or hold the wound until you‚Äôre able to apply bandages or until your team can administer aid. Some areas of the body are effected differently when shot such as your arms may become harder to hold the gun straight, your legs may make it harder for you to move, your stomach may cause you to bleed out faster or even make you drop to the floor.

The game will feature a custom-built mechanic that uses real-time data to calculate bullet velocity and penetration. This system will determine the severity of a player‚Äôs injury based on how much force the bullet retains upon impact.

For example:
	‚Ä¢	A bullet that passes through a desk and a wall before hitting you will do less damage than one that hits you directly.
	‚Ä¢	A 9mm round fired from long range might cause less harm than a 5.56 round fired from the same distance.
	‚Ä¢	A shotgun loaded with buckshot may be less deadly than one loaded with slugs.

1lrji2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1lrji2q/looking_for_technique_advice_for_better_clarity/,Looking for Technique Advice for Better Clarity,"Hi!

I'm generally happy with the taste of my coffees (I prefer light roasts like Sey, September, etc... currently drinking a few great bags of regalia). I use a K-Ultra, Rao-Perger recipe water, usually V60 (though I have a v60, a switch, a fellow flat bottom brewer, an origami, an aeropress, and a melodrip that I use with any of the above when called for), and I am most accustomed to recipes that call for a pretty fine grind.

I'm good at dialing in those fine grind brews and I tend to get coffee with a pretty full body (I know that's partially what my grinder is known for). Just for the sake of my own education and the development of my own technique, I'd really like to work on some recipes that get better clarity and tasting note separation. I know this is what a ZP6 is really good at, but I don't have it in my budget to buy another expensive grinder when I already have a perfectly good one that I like. I know I'll never make exactly a ZP6 brew with a K-Ultra, but I'm sure that with better understanding and better technique, I can manipulate other variables to get brews that will offer a similar tea-like, clarity-forward result. Do you have any advice on recipes I should start with? I know a coarser grind might be a good start, but I'm not really familiar with many coarse-grind recipes. I'd appreciate any input.",1,1751637741.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1lrjho8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lrjho8/i_married_his_enemy_to_forget_my_forbidden_love/,I Married His Enemy To Forget My Forbidden Love By Mary Shelley,"Anaya Moreno has spent years trying to move on from her forbidden love for Kairo Marshall, the man who raised her and who she secretly yearned for since childhood. After being sent away to Europe by Kairo himself, she meets Morgan Simmons, a kind and devoted man who helps her rebuild her life. However, when Kairo realizes his own feelings for Anaya, it may be too late‚Äîshe is about to marry someone else, leaving him to confront the consequences of his choices and the pain he caused her...

# Chapter 1 - Entwined Fates: A Wedding and Wounds

My heart stumbled in my chest as I moved down the hallway, my eyes fixed on Morgan, the man I was about to wed. But before I could reach him, a firm grip encircled my wrist‚Äîon the very day of my wedding.

‚ÄúWhat do you see in him?‚Äù The question caught me off guard, sending my pulse racing. It was Kairo‚Äîthe man who had raised me since I was a child, the man I had secretly yearned for over the years.

He was the one who had sent me away to Europe for four long years after discovering the forbidden feelings I had hidden in my diary.

‚ÄúI admire who he is. I love everything about him.‚Äù My voice was steady, almost icy, mirroring the detachment he had shown when he‚Äôd uncovered my hidden emotions.

The stairwell was unnervingly quiet, the only sound the rhythm of our breaths.

‚ÄúAnaya, I regret it.‚Äù Kairo‚Äôs gaze lingered on my lips, darkening with intensity.

‚ÄúAnaya, can‚Äôt we go back to how things used to be? Close, familiar... instead of being strangers?‚Äù

‚ÄúUncle, I‚Äôm only doing what you wanted,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt expect me to divorce and run away with you, would you?‚Äù

The words slipped out effortlessly, and for a fleeting moment, Kairo seemed to consider it. Why not?

If I were willing, he could marry me.

If I were willing, he could take me anywhere I desired.

But as he steadied himself and met my gaze‚Äîa look that seemed to penetrate his very soul‚Äîhe fell silent.

Anyone else could utter those words, but not him.

He was the one who had left me first, the one who had given up on me.

...

Standing at the familiar threshold, I felt a wave of disorientation. After being sent abroad for four years, I never imagined I‚Äôd have the chance to return to my hometown.

I still remember the words Kairo had spoken as he put me on that plane.

‚ÄúAnaya, you are not allowed to come back without my permission!‚Äù

At the age of eight, after my parents died in an accident, it was my father‚Äôs friend, Kairo Marshall, who took me in and raised me.

When I turned eighteen, Kairo accidentally stumbled upon my diary and saw the affection I had hidden within its pages‚Äîsomething I had never dared to reveal to anyone.

He grew cold instantly, clutching the diary as he accused me of crossing boundaries, calling it utterly absurd.

I didn‚Äôt understand. We weren‚Äôt related by blood, and he wasn‚Äôt my real uncle, so why couldn‚Äôt I have feelings for him?

But he gave me no chance, sending me to Europe, where I stayed for four interminable years.

That place was over 7,500 miles from New York City‚Äîso far, so distant.

He had exiled me harshly, and eventually, I let go of my love for him.

Just as I was about to open the door, my phone rang.

Seeing ‚ÄúHubby‚Äù on the screen brought an unconscious smile to my face, and I answered the call.

‚ÄúAnaya, we‚Äôve set the wedding date. It‚Äôs a month from now. Have you decided if you want the ceremony in New York or elsewhere in the States?‚Äù

The soothing voice of my fianc√©, Morgan, on the other end inexplicably reassured me.

I thought for a moment and replied, ‚ÄúIn the States.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll start preparing then.‚Äù His voice remained gentle, and after a pause, he added, ‚ÄúMake sure you tell your uncle and invite him to our wedding when you‚Äôre back.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù I responded sweetly, and after exchanging a few more words, we reluctantly hung up.

When I was first sent to Europe, I struggled with the language and cultural differences. Life was hard, and on several occasions, I found myself in perilous situations, nearly losing my life during chaotic incidents.

In my panic, I called Kairo, hoping he‚Äôd take me home.

But call after call went unanswered, and every message I sent disappeared into the void.

If Morgan hadn‚Äôt appeared in time to save me, I might have succumbed to one of those terrifying events.

As we got to know each other, we realized we were alumni of the same school, and our bond grew from there.

Over the next two years, Morgan‚Äôs persistent pursuit finally won me over, and I accepted his confession.

After graduation, Morgan proposed immediately, and I agreed.

It was around this time that Kairo reached out to me for the first time, allowing me to come back to pay respects to my parents.

I also returned to deliver an invitation and to tell him I was getting married.

Just as I was entering the house, the door opened from the inside.

‚ÄúHey, Anaya! You‚Äôre back? Long time no see. I thought I recognized your voice outside.‚Äù

Arianna greeted me with a smile, and seeing me frozen, she added, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you remember me?‚Äù

I blinked, and after a moment, recognition dawned on me as I recalled the familiarity cloaked in her once-unknown face.

A nightmare resurfaced, and old fears flooded over me, leaving my limbs stiff and my back cold with shock. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù

Before I could process the situation further, Kairo stepped out.

Tall and composed, he still exuded the same aloof elegance.

Seeing my reaction, he frowned in displeasure. ‚ÄúYou should call her Auntie.‚Äù

Auntie?!

‚ÄúWhy her? She once...‚Äù

Those words about her bullying me hadn‚Äôt even left my lips when Kairo cut me off. ‚ÄúOnce what?‚Äù

I remembered the past.

Life in Europe was harsh when I first arrived. Desperately clinging to hope, I searched for news of him, only to learn he had a girlfriend, one he showered with the same affection he once reserved for me.

Fireworks lighting up the sky on her birthday, 9,999 roses flown in just for her, extravagant gestures at auctions‚Äîall the tenderness he used to show me, now lavished upon her.

I cried alone in the dark, enduring the searing pain, surviving each agonizing night, until I finally accepted that he loved someone else.

But what I never anticipated was that the person who replaced me would be Arianna, the one who bullied me back in school!

Seeing him stand by her side, defending her, I opened my mouth, but ultimately shook my head, my voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúNothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs nothing, come in. Cherish this rare chance to return. Let go of past thoughts. Your parents‚Äô anniversary is coming soon; I‚Äôll go with you to pay respects.‚Äù

‚ÄúArianna will be moving in today too. Settle yourself in, and make sure to get along with her.‚Äù

With that, he left the house with Arianna in tow.

Watching them walk away, I could only offer a bitter smile.

After a long while, I murmured softly to myself, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no future here, Uncle. Once I pay my respects to my parents, I‚Äôll leave for good.‚Äù

They returned by evening, and it took until the dead of night to finish sorting their luggage.

Clutching my wedding invitation, I stood outside Kairo‚Äôs room, mentally preparing myself before softly knocking.

The door opened, revealing not Kairo, but Arianna.

Her smile was laced with malice. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this? After so many years, are you here to catch up with me?‚Äù

I froze as countless nightmarish memories resurfaced. Instinctively, I tried to escape, but she grabbed my arm.

‚ÄúI warn you, keep your mouth shut. Don‚Äôt even think about telling Kairo about the past.‚Äù

Hearing her menacing tone, I suppressed the fear and retorted, ‚ÄúYou think that by my silence, the truth will stay hidden forever? One day, he‚Äôll see your true colors.‚Äù

But Arianna didn‚Äôt seem afraid at all. Instead, she grew more smug. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see about that. I could crush you back then, and I can still do it now.‚Äù

Before I could react, she grabbed a cup of coffee nearby and splashed it onto herself.

‚ÄúAh!‚Äù

As her shriek pierced the air, Kairo rushed out from his study, panic-stricken.

He cradled Arianna in his arms as she lay there pitifully, tears streaming down her face. ‚ÄúKairo, don‚Äôt blame Anaya...‚Äù

‚ÄúAnaya, I allowed you to return, thinking you had let go of your feelings. I never imagined you‚Äôd remain so stubborn. Let me remind you one last time; some things are impossible. No matter what tricks you pull, you won‚Äôt get what you want!‚Äù

His harsh words made everything clear. He thought I‚Äôd thrown the drink at Arianna out of jealousy?

I hurriedly began to explain, ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôve got it wrong. I came to give you a wedding inv...‚Äù

But before I could finish, Kairo carried Arianna away.

Watching him leave, I felt an overwhelming sadness wash over me. I let out a self-deprecating laugh, completing my sentence.

‚ÄúI came to give you a wedding invitation. I don‚Äôt have feelings for you anymore, Uncle. I‚Äôm getting married.‚Äù

# Chapter 2 - Shadows of Unspoken Truths

Kairo showed up the following morning, just as I was clearing the breakfast dishes. I‚Äôd been ready to explain everything that had gone down the day before, but he didn‚Äôt give me the chance. Without a word, he took my hand and marched me out the door.

The car raced through the streets, finally screeching to a halt outside the hospital. Kairo didn‚Äôt release my hand until we were standing at Arianna‚Äôs bedside. Only then did he finally speak.

‚ÄúApologize to Arianna.‚Äù

I clenched my jaw, my refusal written all over my face. ‚ÄúWhy should I apologize for something I didn‚Äôt do?‚Äù

When I turned away, unwilling to admit any fault, disappointment flickered in Kairo‚Äôs eyes. The tension between us was palpable, neither of us willing to back down. It was Arianna who broke the stalemate.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. Anaya‚Äôs still young. Maybe she‚Äôs just not used to sharing her favorite uncle. It‚Äôs just jealousy.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs only a year younger than you. How is that ‚Äòyoung‚Äô?‚Äù Kairo‚Äôs voice was sharp, and his expression darkened further. He turned back to me, his tone leaving no room for argument. ‚ÄúApologize. Now.‚Äù

All the explanations I‚Äôd prepared evaporated. The look on his face made it clear he‚Äôd already made up his mind‚ÄîI was guilty.

I opened my mouth, suddenly too exhausted to fight. Maybe loving my uncle was my biggest mistake. No matter what happened, Kairo would always assume it was my fault.

‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù

After a long silence, I finally gave in. Kairo should‚Äôve been satisfied, but seeing my sudden shift in mood seemed to unsettle him.

I didn‚Äôt care anymore. As far as I was concerned, once I apologized, it was over.

I couldn‚Äôt stand being in that room any longer, caught between them, so I made up an excuse to leave.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the restroom.‚Äù

I splashed cold water on my face, trying to wash away the frustration. Staring at my reflection, I pressed my lips together.

People always favor those they care about, and Kairo was no exception.

Just like I had been, and now Arianna.

Fine.

With that thought, I turned and left the restroom. As I reached the door, I saw him standing nearby, like he‚Äôd been waiting.

Just as I was about to walk past, Kairo spoke up.

‚ÄúArianna wants a sandwich from Ralph's Deli. I need to stay with her, so could you go get it?‚Äù

I hesitated for a moment but didn‚Äôt refuse.

As we brushed past each other, his voice came again, tinged with something unspoken.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to marry Arianna. It‚Äôs best if you let go of those feelings.‚Äù

I paused but didn‚Äôt turn around. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve let it go. In a month, I‚Äôll‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI hope you mean it.‚Äù Kairo cut me off and walked away.

I hadn‚Äôt gone far when I suddenly called after him.

‚ÄúDo you really like Arianna that much? We‚Äôre the same age. If she can, why can‚Äôt I?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Kairo turned back, his eyes warning me. ‚ÄúAnyone else can, just not you! Don‚Äôt bring it up again.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúGot it. I won‚Äôt mention it again.‚Äù

The hospital was on the east side of town, and Ralph's Deli was on the west. It was a long drive, and the place was packed. After waiting in line forever, I finally got the sandwich and hurried back to the hospital.

Out of breath, I handed it to Arianna. She took one bite and tossed it into the trash.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not fresh anymore; it doesn‚Äôt taste good. Never mind, Anaya, could you get me a cupcake from Bailey‚Äôs Bakery?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say a word, just met Kairo‚Äôs gaze before nodding. ‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù

Bailey‚Äôs Bakery was closer, but just as much of a hassle. When I returned, Arianna took one bite and dismissed it.

‚ÄúOh, I forgot to tell you, I don‚Äôt like this flavor.‚Äù

And so, I spent the entire afternoon running back and forth until she finally stopped nitpicking.

Thankfully, after that day, Kairo didn‚Äôt ask me to go back to the hospital. I avoided the place, and by extension, Arianna‚Äôs torment.

Until the day I was discharged. As soon as I got home, there was a knock on my door.

‚ÄúThe club president organized a reunion. Do you want to come along?‚Äù Arianna asked as she walked in.

I was about to say no when she linked her arm with Kairo‚Äôs and pouted playfully.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be so quick to refuse! Staying cooped up at home is so boring. Kairo agreed to go with me. We haven‚Äôt seen everyone since graduation; you should come and have fun!‚Äù

Kairo, pulled into it, seemed a bit helpless but didn‚Äôt contradict her. Instead, he looked at her fondly. When he turned to me, the warmth vanished, replaced by a cold, hard tone.

‚ÄúArianna‚Äôs just thinking of you. Don‚Äôt make things difficult for her.‚Äù

I forced a smile, swallowing the bitterness and self-mockery, and nodded. ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

# Chapter 3 - Veil of Secrets: A Wedding Unveiled

The party was in full swing at a trendy bar in upstate New York. When Arianna Castillo walked in, arm in arm with Kairo Marshall, the room erupted in murmurs of surprise. Meanwhile, my entrance went completely unnoticed‚Äîand honestly, I didn‚Äôt mind. I preferred the quiet, the chance to observe without being seen.

I slipped into a corner, watching Arianna bask in the attention as Kairo attended to her every need. He ordered her favorite drink, draped his jacket over her shoulders when she shivered, and announced, ‚ÄúSince Arianna‚Äôs enjoying herself so much, tonight‚Äôs on me.‚Äù

The crowd buzzed with envy.

‚ÄúArianna, you‚Äôre so lucky! Isn‚Äôt he the CEO of Marshall Enterprises? I can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs here at a casual get-together!‚Äù

‚ÄúI always thought Kairo seemed so aloof on TV, but he‚Äôs so different with her. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs a completely different person.‚Äù

‚ÄúTotally. Every time they‚Äôre spotted together, it‚Äôs front-page news. I wish I could find someone like that.‚Äù

Amid the chatter, someone called out, ‚ÄúArianna, you and Kairo are so perfect together. When‚Äôs the wedding? Don‚Äôt forget to send us invites!‚Äù

Arianna blushed, tugging playfully at Kairo‚Äôs sleeve. He glanced my way briefly, but seeing me calmly sipping my drink, he turned back to her with a soft smile.

‚ÄúSoon,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already started planning.‚Äù

The room erupted in cheers.

Then, someone suggested a game, and the crowd pulled me in, urging me to get Kairo to join. I shook my head. ‚ÄúKairo doesn‚Äôt usually go for these kinds of things.‚Äù

But Arianna turned to him. ‚ÄúCome on, Kairo. Just this once? It‚Äôll be more fun with everyone.‚Äù

At her request, he agreed.

The first round ended with Kairo losing. He drew a penalty card that read: ‚ÄúKiss someone of the opposite sex for one minute.‚Äù

Arianna‚Äôs cheeks flushed, and without hesitation, Kairo pulled her into a passionate kiss, the crowd cheering them on. Once, this might have stung, but I‚Äôd moved on. I clapped along with the others.

The minute flew by, and in the second round, I lost. The challenge was to reveal the top contact in my phone.

I showed my contacts, and everyone immediately noticed the name at the top‚ÄîHusband?!

‚ÄúAnaya, since when are you married? Why didn‚Äôt you tell us?‚Äù someone exclaimed.

I smiled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs recent. You‚Äôll all be invited to the celebration.‚Äù

I tucked my phone away, catching Kairo‚Äôs gaze. His expression was unreadable, but he stayed silent.

Later, as I headed to the restroom, I ran into Kairo in the hallway. His demeanor was icy.

‚ÄúMarriage isn‚Äôt something to joke about,‚Äù he said sharply.

I didn‚Äôt hide anything. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not joking. I came back to honor my family and to let you know I‚Äôm getting married. Uncle, if you‚Äôre willing, I‚Äôd like you to stand as a witness.‚Äù

He almost laughed, looking at me with disbelief. ‚ÄúFine, if you‚Äôre serious, call this husband of yours. I want to hear it from him.‚Äù

Seeing he wouldn‚Äôt budge, I dialed the number. After several rings, it went to voicemail.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a time difference. He might be asleep,‚Äù I explained.

Kairo scoffed. ‚ÄúOnce a lie is exposed, there‚Äôs no point in pretending. It just looks foolish. Anaya, stop joking about this.‚Äù

With that, he walked away.

As he disappeared, my phone rang‚ÄîMorgan Simmons was calling. I answered, his voice warm and sleepy.

‚ÄúSorry, Anaya. I was napping and missed your call. What‚Äôs up?‚Äù

Watching Kairo‚Äôs retreating figure, I sighed softly. ‚ÄúNothing, sorry to wake you.‚Äù

Morgan‚Äôs voice softened. ‚ÄúAnaya, you can never disturb me, no matter when you call.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, and the wedding plans are underway. You once mentioned designing your own dress. Do you want it for the ceremony?‚Äù

I hesitated briefly but then nodded. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

The next day, I went downstairs but didn‚Äôt see Kairo or Arianna. Without dwelling on it, I had a quick breakfast and headed to the bridal shop alone.

The attendant led me to the display area and fetched the dress that took center stage. The white gown hung silently on the mannequin as I took it and changed. Staring at my reflection in the full-length mirror, I felt a wave of nostalgia.

Years ago, I had poured my heart into designing this dress, dreaming of the day I‚Äôd wear it to marry Kairo. Now I wore it again, but I was marrying someone else.

‚ÄúAnaya, what are you doing here?‚Äù

A familiar voice called out from behind me. I turned to see the surprised faces of Arianna Castillo and Kairo Marshall, followed by Arianna‚Äôs usual entourage.

I lowered my gaze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting married. I ordered my wedding dress here, and today I came to pick it up.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre actually getting married? I thought you were kidding,‚Äù Arianna said, her face still full of disbelief. Beside her, Kairo‚Äôs expression was cold and displeased.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite a joke, isn‚Äôt it? Who could she possibly be marrying, and where would she even hold the ceremony?‚Äù Kairo remarked sarcastically.

With a sigh, I tried to explain, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true‚Ä¶‚Äù

But he cut me off sharply. ‚ÄúSaying it once is enough; there‚Äôs no need to repeat it.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt understand why he was reacting so strongly, and frankly, I didn‚Äôt want to explain further. I was just about to ask the store clerk to wrap up the dress, but Arianna suddenly fixed her gaze on my gown, her face lighting up with admiration.

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs just a joke, Anaya, can I have this wedding dress? I really love the design.‚Äù

I was stunned, instinctively shaking my head to refuse. Kairo‚Äôs brows furrowed at my response.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even need a wedding dress. Since Arianna likes it, let her have it,‚Äù Kairo insisted.

I pressed my lips together, unwilling to give in, even as I watched Kairo‚Äôs demeanor grow darker. Arianna quickly intervened, ‚ÄúAlright, alright, why don‚Äôt you go wait outside. I‚Äôll have a chat with Anaya. Sometimes, it‚Äôs easier for us girls to talk things through.‚Äù

After a moment of silence, he chose to leave.

As Arianna approached with a smile, memories of her bullying at school flashed through my mind. Alarm bells rang in my head, and instinctively, I tried to leave, but she suddenly grabbed my hair.

The next second, the sound of relentless slaps filled the air.

The burning pain on my cheeks transported me back to high school, back to when I was bullied. Forced to look up, all I could see was Arianna‚Äôs sneering face.

‚ÄúTake off her clothes!‚Äù she ordered.

# Chapter 4 - Shadows of Betrayal

My friends descended on me like a swarm of angry bees. The familiar shadows of fear crept back into my mind, my breathing growing ragged as my body shook uncontrollably. I froze, my instincts to fight back completely gone, curling into myself like a wounded animal, clutching at my clothes in a desperate attempt to protect myself.

But how could I possibly fend off so many at once?

The wedding dress was torn from my grasp in one brutal motion, leaving me exposed and shivering. My vulnerability seemed to amuse Arianna Castillo, her lips curling into a cruel smirk.

Suddenly, as if struck by inspiration, she pulled out her phone and began snapping pictures of me, muttering under her breath.

‚ÄúThis is too good not to capture. Don‚Äôt you all agree?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, no‚Ä¶‚Äù I begged, my voice trembling, but my pleas only seemed to fuel her excitement as she continued to snap away, her laughter ringing in my ears.

The shrill ring of her phone finally interrupted her cruel antics.

Seeing Kairo‚Äôs name flash on the screen, she answered, her voice instantly sweetened. ‚ÄúKairo, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid she agree?‚Äù Kairo‚Äôs deep voice echoed through the phone.

Arianna glanced at me, her grin widening. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. Anaya‚Äôs always so easy to convince. I sweet-talked her, and she agreed to give me the dress.‚Äù

Still on the phone, she led her group of friends out of the shop.

Once they were gone, I managed to calm down enough to ask the shop assistant, who had been hiding in the corner, to bring me something to wear.

After leaving the bridal shop, I didn‚Äôt head home. Instead, I took the surveillance footage the assistant had pulled for me and went straight to the police station to report the incident.

But as soon as I got home, I received a message from the police department saying that my report had been withdrawn.

Shocked, I called them back immediately.

‚ÄúMiss Moreno, someone claiming to be your uncle came by and said it was all a misunderstanding, so we dropped the case.‚Äù

I was skeptical, but the person on the phone insisted they hadn‚Äôt made a mistake, mentioning my uncle specifically.

After hanging up, I let out a bitter laugh.

Not long after, Kairo stormed into the room, demanding an explanation.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a dress. Did you really have to involve the police?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, Anaya, you agreed to let me have it. Why did you change your mind?‚Äù Arianna‚Äôs voice dripped with fake innocence.

Ignoring her, I stared straight at Kairo, my voice shaking with suppressed anger. ‚ÄúJust a dress? Uncle, did you even watch the footage? Do you know how that dress was taken from me?‚Äù

He was visibly impatient, his words cutting into me like a knife. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to see it. If you want to stay here, you need to learn to get along with Arianna.‚Äù

His words felt like an invisible hand tearing my heart to shreds.

Yes, Arianna was his fianc√©e now.

Of course, everything would revolve around her. How foolish was I to think he would ever stand by me?

With reddened eyes, I laughed at myself, shaking my head. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt be staying here. I won‚Äôt have to get along with her. I‚Äôm getting married soon.‚Äù

Without waiting for Kairo‚Äôs inevitable reprimands, I turned and left him behind.

That night, I tossed and turned, unable to find peace.

As the night deepened, I woke up parched and stumbled downstairs for a glass of water.

Returning to my room, I was about to lie down when I realized something felt‚Ä¶ off.

Startled, I looked around. The unfamiliar surroundings stunned me until I realized I had wandered into a room Kairo had always forbidden me to enter.

Panicked, I tried to leave, but my eyes caught on a string of rosary beads hanging on the wall.

My breath caught in my throat as disbelief washed over me.

How could those beads be here?!

# Chapter 5 - Shadows of the Past

The first time I laid eyes on those prayer beads was at my parents' funeral. Kairo had been the one my parents entrusted with my care after their passing. When he arrived to take me to the Marshall family home, the beads.........

Hello everyone,
I was thinking today of an idea about a Death Metal Band that will have as topics basic life problems and overreacting/overthinking them. Or inner Karen that has like a twist. 
Examples of songs:

1 phone is dead( having card, maps, ID on it)

2 late to work( having a flat, boss calls, important meeting)

3 spilled my coffee (in a rush, grab a coffee, lid is loose)

4 card doesnt work (confused, checking account, empty,...)

5 i am fired/redundant (friday, getting ready for weekend, planned break, and bam, lost the job)

6 hair in the food( karen having food and finding hair arguing etc, the twist is its her own hair, white of course)

Etc. Just some ideas. 

In my mind the music sounds like SOAD for the soft part and hard voice for stressful unexpected urgent moments. 

Thank you for listeningüòÖ,

Every morning, I start by making myself a cup of coffee ‚Äì like the really strong kind that could wake up a zombie üòÇ. Then, I set aside just 10 minutes to meditate.

1lrjf33,https://i.redd.it/ckt7s4vo5vaf1.jpeg,The Science Behind Why You Can't Smell Your Own Fragrance (But Everyone Else Can),"Alright fragheads, let's talk about something that's probably driven all of us crazy at some point: spraying on your signature scent, only to have it completely disappear on you within an hour, while your coworkers are still asking ""what are you wearing?"" at the end of the day.

If you've ever panic-resprayed thinking your fragrance had zero longevity, or if you've been convinced your bottle was a fake because you couldn't smell it on yourself, this post is for you. What you're experiencing is **olfactory fatigue** (aka nose blindness), and it's actually a sign that your fragrance might be performing *better* than you think.

## Your Brain is Basically Trolling You

Here's the deal: your brain is constantly filtering out ""background noise"" to focus on new, potentially important information. Think about it evolutionarily ‚Äì you need to notice the smell of smoke or spoiled food, not be constantly aware of your own body odor or the fabric softener on your clothes.

When you spray a fragrance, your olfactory receptors (the smell detectors in your nose) initially fire like crazy sending signals to your brain. But after continuous exposure, they basically go ""yeah, we get it, same smell, moving on"" and start to desensitize. Meanwhile, people walking past you are getting fresh hits of those fragrance molecules and can smell you just fine.

## The Molecular Culprits: Why Some Frags Are Nose-Blind Magnets

Certain aroma chemicals are absolutely notorious for causing olfactory fatigue, and if you're into modern designer fragrances, you've definitely encountered these:

**Ambroxan & Friends (Cetalox, Amberwood):** These are the kings of nose blindness. They're in everything from Sauvage to Aventus to BR540. They're incredibly diffusive and tenacious, but your brain adapts to them fast. This is why you'll see people complaining about ""weak performance"" on fragrances that are actually nuclear to everyone else.

**Iso E Super:** This one's sneaky. It's designed to be subliminal and skin-like, but it comes and goes in your perception. Molecule 01 is basically pure Iso E Super, which is why some people swear they can't smell it at all while others get strong wafts.

**Synthetic Musks:** These clean, laundry-like musks are everywhere in modern fragrances. They're powerful but your nose adapts quickly, leaving you thinking your fragrance has disappeared when it's still projecting.

**Calone (Marine/Aquatic Notes):** That fresh, ozonic smell in aquatic fragrances. Light but persistent, and easy for your brain to tune out.

## The Hall of Fame: Fragrances That'll Make You Think You're Anosmic

Based on countless posts in this sub and other fragrance communities, these are the biggest offenders:

**Dior Sauvage (EDT/EDP):** The poster child for nose blindness. The Ambroxan content is insane, so you'll go nose blind fast while projecting like a beast.

**Creed Aventus (& clones like CDNIM):** Everyone's had that ""is my Aventus fake?"" moment. Nope, just nose blind to that Ambroxan base.

**Molecule 01:** Literally designed to disappear and reappear. Some people are genetically unable to smell Iso E Super at all.

**Versace Eros:** Sweet, minty, and loaded with synthetic musks. Classic nose blindness territory.

**Acqua di Gio:** Those marine notes will fool you into thinking it's gone when it's still there.

## Pro Tips for Managing Nose Blindness

**Rotate your collection:** Don't wear the same fragrance daily. Your nose needs a break.

**Strategic spraying:** Avoid spraying near your nose. Wrists, back of neck, and clothing work better for longevity checking.

**Get a fragrance buddy:** Seriously, ask someone you trust. They'll tell you if you're overdoing it or if your fragrance is actually gone.

**The coffee bean trick:** Smell coffee beans between testing fragrances, but for daily wear, just step outside for fresh air.

**Take fragrance breaks:** If you're obsessed with a particular scent, take a few days off from it occasionally.

## The Bottom Line

Next time you can't smell your fragrance, don't panic and don't overspray. Your nose is just doing its job. The fact that you go nose blind to certain fragrances often means they're actually performing well ‚Äì they're just too good at saturating your olfactory receptors.

Remember: you wear fragrance for others to enjoy as much as for yourself. If you can't smell it but people are still complimenting you, that's a win, not a failure.

---

**TL;DR:** Nose blindness is normal biology, not weak fragrance performance. Ambroxan-heavy frags like Sauvage and Aventus are notorious for this. Just because you can't smell your fragrance doesn't mean it's gone ‚Äì ask others, they can probably still smell you just fine.",2,1751637529.0,Perfumes,2,0.6,False

Please convince me.,"I am based in London, UK. It is my husband's dream to go to New Zealand for a longer holiday (approx 3-4 weeks) and the opportunity has presented itself for us and our two kids to travel to NZ this coming Christmas. I realise that I'm an outlier but for whatever reason, I'm just not very keen on New Zealand. On paper, it is everything that I love -- beautiful wilderness, friendly people, good food and wine, coffee etc etc. I even love the comedy coming out of there. But I have a big block and I'd much rather explore closer to home (Italy, Greece) or go to Japan where I am originally from and haven't returned to for years. My husband is dead set on going, and while he's usually quite open to negotiation, he's also dug in his heels with this one, and I'm starting to feel resentful about being 'made' to go to NZ (I know, this sounds ridiculous). Please convince me that this is going to be great! Everyone around us is saying it's their favourite place, and that has had no effect on me. A good friend whose partner is from there is the only person who has said it's actually quite boring and that we shouldn't go for longer than 2 and half weeks.

But here we are, and I'm genuinely excited to share why **7 Reasons Coffee Banana Smoothie For Weight Loss Actually Works (And Tastes Amazing)** isn't just another health trend.

Last month, I was stuck in that familiar cycle of trying every ""miracle"" weight loss hack on the internet. You know the drill ‚Äî promising starts, disappointing results, back to square one. Then my coworker mentioned this coffee banana combo she'd been making, and something about it just clicked.

The thing is, most weight loss smoothies taste like punishment. This one? It literally tastes like a coffee shop treat, but it's actually working with your body instead of against it.

üëâ *Want the full breakdown of why this combination is so effective?* [*Check out the complete science behind coffee banana smoothies for weight loss*](%7Blink%7D) *‚Äî it's fascinating stuff.*

**Why Quality Ingredients Actually Matter Here**

Here's what I learned the hard way: not all bananas and coffee are created equal. I started with whatever bananas were cheapest and instant coffee from my pantry. The smoothie was... fine. But when I switched to organic bananas that were just starting to get those little brown spots and used freshly brewed coffee (cooled down, obviously), the difference was night and day.

The slightly overripe bananas have more natural sugars and blend into this creamy, almost ice cream-like base. The real coffee adds complexity and those metabolism-boosting compounds that instant just can't match. It's like the difference between a gas station sandwich and one from your favorite local spot.

**The Texture Secret Nobody Talks About**

I'm not going to give away all the steps here, but there's one trick that completely changed my smoothie game. It's all about the order you add things and the temperature contrast.

Most people just dump everything in the blender at once, but that's missing the magic. The way the cold and warm elements interact creates this almost mousse-like texture that's incredibly satisfying. It's thick enough to eat with a spoon but smooth enough to drink through a straw.

**A Little Coffee History That Blew My Mind**

Did you know that coffee was originally eaten, not drunk? Ethiopian tribes would mix coffee cherries with animal fat to create energy-rich snacks for long journeys. Fast forward to today, and we're basically doing a modern version of that ancient practice ‚Äî combining coffee with other whole foods for sustained energy and appetite control.

There's something poetic about how **7 Reasons Coffee Banana Smoothie For Weight Loss Actually Works (And Tastes Amazing)** connects us to this old wisdom while fitting perfectly into our busy modern lives.

**My Unexpected Discovery**

To be honest, the weight loss part was just a bonus for me initially. I started making these because I was tired of spending $6 on coffee shop smoothies that left me hungry an hour later. But after about two weeks, I noticed my afternoon energy crashes were basically gone.

Then I realized I wasn't reaching for my usual 3 PM snack anymore. The smoothie was keeping me satisfied from breakfast until lunch without that shaky, hungry feeling I used to get. When I stepped on the scale after a month, I was down 8 pounds without really trying.

**The Real Magic Is In The Timing**

What makes **7 Reasons Coffee Banana Smoothie For Weight Loss Actually Works (And Tastes Amazing)** so effective isn't just the ingredients ‚Äî it's when and how you drink it. I've found that having it about 30 minutes before my usual breakfast completely changes how I feel throughout the morning.

The caffeine kicks in gradually instead of all at once, and the banana provides just enough natural sugars to keep everything balanced. It's like having a personal energy manager that knows exactly when to release fuel.

**Why This Isn't Just Another Fad**

I've tried enough ""miracle"" weight loss tricks to know when something is sustainable versus just another quick fix. This smoothie works because it's addressing multiple issues at once: energy, satisfaction, cravings, and metabolism support.

The best part? It doesn't feel like I'm depriving myself of anything. If anything, I look forward to it every morning. When was the last time you could say that about a weight loss strategy?

**The Bottom Line**

Here's what convinced me that **7 Reasons Coffee Banana Smoothie For Weight Loss Actually Works (And Tastes Amazing)** is worth sharing: it's simple, it tastes incredible, and it fits into real life. No weird ingredients, no complicated prep, no feeling like you're missing out on ""normal"" food.

1lrizi3,https://v.redd.it/fqddc4072vaf1,[Help] Gaggenau CMP250/08 Coffee Machine Won‚Äôt Brew ‚Äì Only Steam Comes Out,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm reaching out here because I‚Äôm out of options. I have a Gaggenau CMP250100 /08 built-in coffee machine that‚Äôs suddenly stopped brewing coffee. The hot water function still works perfectly fine, but when I try to brew coffee, the machine starts up, runs for a few seconds, then stops. After that, it seems to release pressure somewhere internally, and only steam comes out.

I‚Äôve tried contacting the official service provider, but they‚Äôre either completely swamped or understaffed. I‚Äôve gotten no replies to emails or phone calls. The next service provider is three hours away because we live quite remote. 

The machine is probably around 8‚Äì9 years old. We suspect the issue might be with the brew unit or the connection to it. Regular cleaning and descaling are done, so it‚Äôs not due to lack of maintenance on these parts I hope.

I‚Äôve attached a video showing what happens. I‚Äôd be super grateful if anyone here could help troubleshoot or let me know if replacing the brew unit might solve it.

1lrivq9,https://v.redd.it/eanpbhvi0vaf1,"I got tired of wondering who‚Äôs reading my chats, so I built an iOS keyboard that lets me encrypt messages anywhere","### I built an iOS keyboard that lets you encrypt messages in any chat app ‚Äî no accounts, no subscriptions

Hey everyone üëã

A few months back, I found myself obsessing over the idea that even with end-to-end encryption, my private messages might not be as private as I hoped. Sure, apps like WhatsApp and iMessage say they're secure ‚Äî but what if the app itself is compromised? What if I just don‚Äôt trust *where* the message goes once it leaves my phone?

That idea stuck with me.

So I started building a solution ‚Äî something simple, personal, and independent from any chat service. After some late nights and too much coffee, I ended up creating **AirLock**: a custom iOS keyboard that lets you **encrypt and decrypt messages inside *any* chat app** using your own secret key.

No server. No cloud. No account. Just you and your key.

---

### üîê How It Works

- You generate a secure key in the app and give it a label.
- Share it with your contact (you can use a QR code to keep it simple).
- Then, when you're chatting, just:
  - Type your message
  - Tap **üîí Encrypt**
  - Send the result
- Your contact pastes it in their chat field and taps **üîì Decrypt**.

It‚Äôs all handled by the keyboard, so you can use it in **iMessage, Telegram, Messenger, Instagram DMs ‚Äî anywhere** you can type.

---

### üí° Why I Built It

I didn‚Äôt want to rely on a chat app‚Äôs promise of privacy. I wanted **my own layer of control** ‚Äî something I could add on top of any platform. No logins, no external dependencies, no hidden analytics.

Just me, my contacts, and the ability to scramble messages into something meaningless without the key.

---

### üí∏ One-Time Purchase

- **No subscriptions**
- **No ads**
- **No data collection**
- Just a one-time payment to support development and unlock lifetime access

---

### üì≤ Try It

Would love to hear your feedback or thoughts ‚Äî and if you try it out, let me know how it goes. I‚Äôm already working on a few improvements based on early testers' ideas.

1lrins5,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lrins5/el_alat/,El Alat,"Every summer, my family and I would leave Barcelona behind and head to my grandparents‚Äô village in the Catalan Pyrenees.
You know the type‚Äîstone houses, red rooftops, winding alleys barely wide enough for a car. A place that feels frozen in time, nestled between ancient mountains and older silences.

At first, it always felt like a relief. No traffic. No heat shimmering off concrete. Just fresh air, pine trees, and the sound of cowbells echoing from distant hills.

But that summer was different.
That summer, I saw something I can‚Äôt explain.

I woke up.
Not slowly. It was like something ripped me out of sleep.

3:07 AM.
The digits on my old travel alarm clock glowed blood-red in the dark. I felt‚Ä¶ wrong. My skin prickled, like my nerves were whispering before my brain could catch up.

That house‚Äîmy grandparents‚Äô house‚Äîhad always made me feel uneasy. Since I was a kid. There was something off about it. The air felt heavier there. Like the walls remembered things they weren‚Äôt supposed to.

But that night, it wasn‚Äôt just the house.

It was the silence.

A silence so deep it felt unnatural.
No creaking wood. No wind through the shutters. No barking dogs or rustling leaves. The kind of silence that doesn‚Äôt just surround you‚Äîit presses on you.

I was used to the constant hum of the city at night: scooters buzzing by, voices from bars, a garbage truck in the distance. But here, in this little village high in the mountains, there was nothing.

It felt like the whole world had stopped breathing.

I sat up, heart beating too fast. Told myself I just needed some water.

I crept toward the kitchen. The floorboards groaned under my feet‚Äîlouder than they should‚Äôve. Every step sounded like I was stepping into something‚Äôs ear.

In the kitchen, the fridge was the only thing making noise, its low hum suddenly comforting. I opened it, grabbed a bottle, and drank.

That‚Äôs when I looked out the window.

The full moon lit up the rooftops in pale silver. In the distance, I could see the bell tower that marked the center of the village‚Äîits cross silhouetted against the sky.

And then I saw it.

Something was perched at the top.

It looked like a statue at first. Something angular and still, hunched like a gargoyle. But it was wrong. It was too tall. Its limbs too long. It looked‚Ä¶ coiled. Ready.

Then it moved.

It stood up. Slowly. Smoothly. Like unfolding a nightmare.

Wings. Immense, leathery wings unfurled from its back, stretching wide as if waking from centuries of sleep. And then, with a single beat, it leapt into the night sky.

No sound. No rush of wind. Just‚Ä¶ gone. Swallowed by the dark.

I couldn‚Äôt move. I just stood there, staring at the empty tower.

The next morning, over breakfast, I asked my grandmother if the village had any old stories.
She smiled without looking up from her coffee.

‚ÄúAh,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou mean l‚ÄôAlat.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Winged One,‚Äù she added, like it was the punchline of a joke. ‚ÄúHalf-man, half-bat. Lives in the mountains. Comes down at night, looking for lost souls. People who walk alone, or who stay up too late asking questions.‚Äù

She laughed.
I didn‚Äôt.

Because I hadn‚Äôt told her what I saw.
And yet... her story matched it.
Perfectly.

I haven't been back since.

1lrin0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy_Universe/comments/1lrin0g/brainfreeze_and_sia_the_royal_routine/,Brainfreeze and Sia: The Royal Routine,"Setting: Victor Blake‚Äôs apartment. It‚Äôs quiet. Too quiet.

The curtains are half-drawn. There‚Äôs a half-eaten protein bar on the counter. Victor is seated on the couch in a hoodie, staring at the same notebook page for the last 37 minutes.

The clock ticks. A day has clearly slipped through his fingers‚Äîa foggy, emotionally drained kind of day.

Enter: Sia the Cat. Poised. Graceful. A queen in a crown of her own fluff. She hops up onto the table and stares Victor down.

Sia‚Äôs collar glows: ‚ÄúVictor Blake. This is your third day in a row forgetting feed me on time.‚Äù

Victor doesn‚Äôt answer.

She sits. Tail curls. She lifts one paw‚Äîtaps it on the notebook. Time to pay attention to her Majesty.

Sia: ‚ÄúI want my medicine mixed with salmon. Not albacore. If I get tuna again I will throw up on your shoes.‚Äù

She head butts him: ‚ÄúDid you eat lunch today, or did you absorb nutrients through sadness again?‚Äù

Victor: ‚Äú‚Ä¶I had coffee.‚Äù

Sia: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bean water. It doesn‚Äôt count.‚Äù

She leaps off the table, trots into the kitchen, and returns with a water bottle in her mouth. (Strong kitty!) She drops it in his lap like it‚Äôs a dead mouse offering.

Sia: ‚ÄúDrink. Now. Or I chew on your neuro-interface cords again.‚Äù

Victor sighs‚Äîbut takes the bottle. Drinks. Halfway through, he pauses.

Victor: ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm trying, you know.‚Äù

Sia bops his head with a paw: ‚ÄúI know. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. You take care of me, I take care of you. But royal dignity requires routine. Water, food, scritches. Fresh air‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Pooping.‚Äù

Victor chokes on his water a little.

Victor, incredulous: ‚ÄúDid you just say pooping?‚Äù

Sia: ‚ÄúEverybody poops. Though you could clean my litter box if you‚Äôre feeling brave.‚Äù

She leaps onto the back of the couch and rubs her head against his shoulder.

Sia: ‚ÄúI know the fog days. But you don‚Äôt get to sink and stay there. Because you matter. Because your brain is amazing. Because someone out there is waiting on you to explain something important in a way only you can.‚Äù

Victor smiles as he pets her.

Victor: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a tyrant.‚Äù

Sia flicks her tail: ‚ÄúI am a Queen. You adore me.‚Äù

She curls up beside him, purring. He turns the page in his notebook and starts writing again‚Äînothing big, just a small note: Drink. Move. Breathe. Try again tomorrow.

One week before the trip J. asked me if I want to start going out with other women to have something going when we come back home.
I told her no, that there is no rush for me and I don't overlap women.

The truth is  weeks before the trip I asked a girl out (K) that I had history with (we casually dated before).
I went to have a coffee with K but for me it was strictly platonic (Here is where J disagrees because she says we had a history and I was attracted to her).

Following this platonic date we kept on talking and some days before my trip with J I saw her again. Things started to escalate and the discussion got more serious with the potential of a relationship so I agreed with K to pursue it further after my trip with J ends to see where it goes.
I kept taking with K.
When I told J during our trip she was hurt and said I betrayed her trust, that I could have waited until we were over before I pursued something new. Especially since she asked me if I want to so and I said no. 
Her being able to trust me was to her the most important part of what we had between us.
I disagree because I didn't have sex with K so I didn't cross any line and didn't break her trust.

J is also hurt because she planned this whole trip with little input from my part and she couldn't enjoy it as much because of what I told her about K.

The plan is to carry on with K as soon as I get back home.

So am I the asshole? I never slept with K and didn't break any of the things I promised to J. J was a situationship, not my girlfriend.

\- Why I Chose It: Minimalism + streetwear vibe. That little logo on the chest? So understated yet so eye-catching.

\- Quality Check: Thick, heavyweight cotton that feels great without the cheap ‚Äúsee-through‚Äù feel. The oversized fit is perfect for that effortless ‚ÄúI woke up like this‚Äù look.

2. Loro Piana Suede Loafers ü•ø

\- Luxe Feel: These shoes exude ‚Äúquiet luxury‚Äù. The suede is silky soft and the stitching is impeccable.

\- Comfort Test: Whether you're wearing it for a work meeting or a dinner party, you'll feel like you're walking on clouds (even after 10,000 steps).

\- Cons: Suede = hard to maintain. Buy a protective spray - trust me.

3. Burberry Check Shorts ü©≥

\- Classic Vitality: Burberry's iconic check never goes out of style. Lightweight nylon material = summer MVP.

\- Flexible Fit: Elastic waistband + drawstring = adjustable, suitable for any tummy-control occasion (pizza night? No problem).

\- Versatile Elements: Color-blocked check adds a fresh touch - this is not your grandpa's Burberry style.

4. Chanel Silver Sneakers üëü

\- Fashion Elements: Silver embellishment + double C logo = instant ""smart casual"" vitality.

\- Surprise: Super light! Mesh fabric ensures your feet can breathe - perfect for hot weather or going to the gym (like walking to the gym... and then having a smoothie).

\- Compliment magnet: Every time I wear these, someone asks, ‚ÄúIs this from Chanel?!‚Äù

5. Burberry Check Slides

\- Lazy-time pick: Comfortable enough for hours of Netflix watching, stylish enough to wear while sipping coffee.

\- Design highlights: The checkered laces complement the black sole‚Äîit‚Äôs effortlessly light and flexible.

\- Sizing suggestion: The sizing runs narrow‚Äîif you have wider feet, size up.

6. Polo Ralph Lauren White Polo üèá

\- American classic: You can‚Äôt miss this in your wardrobe. Crisp white, sturdy fabric, and that iconic pony‚Äîit never goes out of style.

\- Versatile: Wear it with chinos at the office or shorts at a barbecue. Perfect for every occasion.

7. Goyard White Crossbody üéí

\- Personality: Goyard‚Äôs monogram is white? Clean and neat. Holds phone, wallet and sunglasses - perfect for day trips.

\- Practical and flexible: adjustable strap (crossbody or one shoulder) + magnetic closure = easy to use, hard to steal.

\- Bought for my family

8. ESSENTIALS Grey Shorts üèãÔ∏è

\- Streetwear essential: soft and stretchy fleece - feels like a blanket (but cooler). Oversized fit = easy to breathe.

\- Understated logo: small logo on the leg says ""I know fashion"" without being too ostentatious.

\- Must-have: Workout, lazy homebody or tacos. Simply... a must-have.

Final Thoughts:

Most of the pieces exceeded my expectations - AMIRI t-shirt and Loro Piana loafers? Great value. Now it's your turn:

\- Which pieces did you love/hate?

\- What fit adjustments should I make?

\- What brands do I need to buy next?

Leave your thoughts in the comments - let's discuss fashion successes (and failures) together.

Y'all know how it goes... there's times when mom is the only thing they care about, but the the pendulum swings back. All week when I come home I walk in the door then turn and walk back out because he's been waiting for me to show up so we can play catch. He sucks at catching, but he likes to throw. 

Well, dinner comes round and he's staring me down across the table. As usual, I have hand selected the perfect hot sauce for the meal and for the first time in his life the kiddo says ""dad, can I have some hot sauce?"".

Now, understand that my kids HATE spicy food. They have complained about tomato soup being too spicy. But what am I gonna do? I put a bit of hot sauce on the side of his plate so he can decide how much to  use. 

This kid BARELY touches the food to the hotsauce... there cannot be more than 3 atoms of hot sauce on the food. He eats it and then never touches it again for the rest of the meal. 

... but a monologue begins. 

""Mmmm, thats good hot sauce! I like hot sauce! Dad, do you like the hot sauce? Hot sauce is yummy!""

And then, when I confirm that ""yes, I do like it"" the motivation behind the plan reveals itself.

""Yeah! I like it too! Dad and I both like it. We're hot sauce buddies! ... are we hot sauce buddies, dad?"" And I confirm of course, that we are hot sauce buddies. 

All dinner long he talked about this hot sauce while ignoring it on his plate. And all dinner long I'm grinning up a storm. There's no feeling so warm as your kids finding new ways to show how much they love you. 


I'd forgotten it already this morning. But he was up early and sat with me & mom as we had our 6am coffee. I was chatting with her about 4th of July grilling plans. Decided the plan and went silent. And out of the silence I hear a little boy voice. 

""Dad, can I have hot sauce with my burger? We're hot sauce buddies"".

1lribqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lribqg/how_does_tastyle_singleserve_coffee_maker_20/,How does Tastyle Single-Serve Coffee Maker 2.0 review stack up for daily use?,"**My Experience with the Tastyle 0e16ef67-4582-4a9d-a012-265f99ee28c9 Single Serve Hot & Iced Coffee Maker**  

I‚Äôve been using the Tastyle 0e16ef67-4582-4a9d-a012-265f99ee28c9 for a few months now, and it has easily become one of the most convenient tools in my kitchen. The promise of brewing both hot and iced coffee, paired with its compact design, made me eager to put this machine to the test. From its modern gray finish to the user-friendly operation, this device caters perfectly to busy mornings and relaxed evenings alike.  

**Design and Build Quality**  

The sleek and modern gray exterior adds a touch of elegance to my otherwise chaotic countertop. With dimensions of 10.3""D x 4.7""W x 12.2""H and a lightweight build of 3.5 pounds, it fits snugly in small spaces like my compact kitchen. Even my aunt, who occasionally borrows it for her RV, appreciated how seamlessly it integrates into cramped environments. The splash-preventing drip tray is an underrated hero, ensuring no mess when I opt for my taller travel mugs.  

[Check Tastyle 0e16ef67-4582-4a9d-a012-265f99ee28c9 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dhrrt1t1/)  

**Coffee Customization and Brew Options**  

This coffee maker truly stands out with its three brew styles‚ÄîClassic, Bold, and Over Ice. I found the Bold setting especially satisfying when working late nights, giving a rich, robust flavor to my coffee grounds. On hotter days, the Over Ice option was my go-to; it brews at a concentrated strength to avoid watered-down iced coffee. Having the flexibility to use both K-Cups and ground coffee is a game-changer for someone like me who enjoys experimenting with new caffeine options.  

**Good Aspects**  

- Versatile brew styles: Classic, Bold, and Over Ice.  
- Compatible with both K-Cups and ground coffee, providing flexibility.  
- User-friendly detachable 40 oz reservoir, allowing 4‚Äì5 cups before refills.  

**Convenience Features**  

The removable 40-ounce water tank felt like a blessing, letting me brew multiple cups without constant refills. I had friends over for a brunch last weekend, and the six cup size options ranging from 6 to 24 ounces kept everyone happy. Cleaning, usually a dreaded chore with other machines, was simplified by the built-in cleaning function. Even the reusable filter made things more eco-friendly, appealing to my environmentally conscious sister.  

**Areas for Improvement**  

- The machine is a bit slow with the Over Ice option, possibly due to its deliberate brewing process.  
- While the auto shut-off feature works after ten minutes, it might not suit those who need many cups in quick succession.  

**Energy Efficiency and Safety**  

Energy-saving features like the 10-minute auto shut-off are often overlooked but extremely appreciated by someone like me who forgets to turn devices off before leaving the house. On top of that, the BPA-free materials give me peace of mind knowing I‚Äôm not exposing my three-year-old nephew to any harmful chemicals when brewing tea for the family (yes, it can brew tea too!).  

**Competing Products**  

When comparing this machine to rivals like the Keurig K-Slim and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the Tastyle coffee maker holds its ground quite well. Unlike Keurig‚Äôs models, it offers better splash control and more brew size options, a feature I found convenient for varied mug sizes. However, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew lets you brew a full pot, which the Tastyle doesn‚Äôt offer, making it better suited for larger gatherings. That said, the compactness and iced coffee functionality of this brewer make it a superior single-serve option.  

**Smart Spending**  

For what this device offers in terms of versatility and build quality, it‚Äôs an excellent example of affordable quality. Similar machines with comparable features often come at a much higher price. It‚Äôs an investment that pays off for someone who cherishes customized coffee experiences without breaking the bank.

1lria08,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1lria08/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

""That perfume..."" I wanted to say, but the cold blade in my throat prevented it. Bergamot and steel. The same combination that Jix used. 

Confession: I rewrote this scene about 7 times. 
Will it be worth it? That's what I'm wondering as I review the document for the twentieth time. 

Will Jix be an accomplice to Amara, to the murderers... or something worse?

Working on the Fourth of July, while others celebrate, is not new. In July of 1777, months before battles raged and freedom hung by a thread, Philadelphia‚Äôs City Tavern opened its doors to a small circle of patriots. They gathered not for politics but to raise a glass, and for the first time to mark July 4 as a day of celebration¬π. This modest act, in a dimly lit room of wood and candle smoke, set a tradition that echoes through every backyard grill and fireworks sky today.

**From Humble Beginnings**

City Tavern opened in late 1773, by 53 prominent citizens eager to give their growing city a grand meeting place. Daniel Smith signed the first lease in December of that year for ¬£300 per year, roughly five years‚Äô wages for a laborer¬≤. The new tavern boasted five floors, three dining rooms, two coffee rooms, a bar room, and servants‚Äô quarters¬≤. Above it all stood the second-largest ballroom on the continent.

In May of 1774, Paul Revere rode in with word that Parliament had closed Boston‚Äôs port¬≥. Two hundred men promptly gathered at City Tavern to draft a letter of sympathy and resolve‚Å¥. By autumn, delegates of the First Continental Congress slipped in and out of the tavern doors between sessions at Carpenter‚Äôs Hall¬≥. Among them were George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Richard Henry Lee.

**A Feast for Freedom**

On July 4, 1777, the war had burned for two years, and spirits ran both low and high. City Tavern hosted the first Independence Day celebration in a simple but bold gesture of unity and hope‚Åµ. The menu likely lacked hot dogs and hamburgers but brimmed with colonial staples. Fish house punch, rum, brandy, lemon, sugar, and tea flowed freely‚Å∂. Pepperpot stew simmered layers of meat, peppers, and spices in a communal pot.

Patriots stood in clusters by wooden tables, swapping tales of the front lines and hopes for peace. Mary Thompson, whose diary survives, later wrote, ‚ÄúThe punch was sharp as our resolve, and the stew thick with promise‚Äù‚Å∑. A short speech praised the fallen, cheered the living, and blessed the declaration that now bore fruit in the fields and firesides of a new nation.

**The Rise of a Landmark**

In the months that followed, City Tavern became the Continental Army‚Äôs headquarters from August 3 to 5, 1777‚Å∏. Washington and his aides sketched strategies over bowls of beef and ale‚Åπ. In September 1787, just days after appending their names to the Constitution, the framers dined together in its northwest dining room, John Adams calling it, ‚Äúthe most genteel tavern in America‚Äù¬π‚Å∞.

Through the early republic, the tavern hosted banquets for John Jay‚Äôs election as president of Congress and feted George Washington on his way to New York for his inauguration in 1789¬π¬π. Its native yellow pine floors creaked beneath the boots of soldiers and statesmen alike.

**Fire, Loss, and Revival**

Fate struck on March 22, 1834, when a blaze tore through the roof¬π¬≤. The building limped on for two more decades before final demolition in 1854¬π¬≥. For over a century, only a marker and memory stood on the corner of 2nd and Walnut.

In 1975, as America prepared for its Bicentennial, a faithful reconstruction rose from period images, insurance surveys, and written accounts¬π‚Å¥. By July 4, 1976, City Tavern 2.0 opened, staffed by costumed servers and anchored by recipes of pepperpot, turkey pot pie, and Sally Lunn bread¬π‚Åµ. Yet it welcomed modern tastes too, from fried tofu to iced tea.

Under chef Walter Staib‚Äôs direction from 1994, the menu blended centuries, each dish served with stories of Ben Franklin‚Äôs experiments and Washington‚Äôs labels on porter beer¬π‚Å∂. Staib‚Äôs PBS show¬†**A Taste of History**¬†carried City Tavern‚Äôs story into homes across America, winning 13 Emmys.

**Closure and the Path Forward**

In November of 2020, the clatter of tankards fell silent. The pandemic dampened tables, and the National Park Service sought a new operator¬π‚Å∑. As of 2025, the search continues, with hopes that City Tavern 3.0 might open in time for the Semiquincentennial.

Today, we link July 4 with grills and fireworks. Yet long before hot dogs hissed on charcoal and rockets flared over riverbanks, City Tavern hosted the first true celebration of American independence. Its stones have echoed with the voices of patriots, its hearth warmed by their meals, and its legacy lives on in every toast to liberty.

The screen blazed with a message from Esmeralda Powell, his chosen Luna: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs out of the picture. When do we tell them I‚Äôm carrying your heir?‚Äù Tears stung my eyes, blurring the words that unraveled every tender vow he‚Äôd made, every night I‚Äôd spent tangled in his arms believing I was his future.

# Chapter 1 - Broken Promises, Shattered Dreams

When I received Esmeralda Powell's mate-marking invitation, the Alpha‚Äôs name printed next to hers as her chosen mate sent a cold shiver down my spine. I stood in the dim light of my room, the crumpled paper trembling in my hands. My wolf stirred uneasily in the back of my mind, a low growl of protest rumbling through my thoughts. ""Caleb Lawson,"" I whispered, the name tasting like ash on my tongue. ""You‚Äôre marking her?""

Caleb, the Alpha of the Silver Moon Pack, turned to me with that infuriatingly calm expression, his piercing gaze cutting through me like a blade. ""Why not?"" he said, his voice dripping with condescension. ""Did you think I was going to mark you?""

He stepped closer, his towering frame casting a shadow over me, the scent of pine and dominance filling the air. His hands reached out to grip my shoulders, his touch both possessive and dismissive. ""Even after the marking ceremony, I‚Äôll still keep you close,"" he said, his tone casual, as if discussing the weather. ""Isn‚Äôt it all about the pack‚Äôs benefit, after all?""

His words hit me like a blow to the chest, leaving me gasping for air. I had thought our bond was more than this‚Äîmore than a calculated arrangement. My wolf whimpered, a sound only I could hear, her pain echoing my own. ""Alpha,"" I said, my voice trembling, ""we were supposed to be mates. How did it become just... this?""

Caleb‚Äôs lips curled into a smirk, his dark eyes glinting with amusement. ""Esmeralda is the only daughter of the Powell Pack, their future Luna. Mark her, and their resources are mine. Given your mother‚Äôs debts to my pack, we can keep this arrangement private, but mark you? That‚Äôs a fantasy."" He leaned in, his breath hot against my ear. ""So be wise. I won‚Äôt cast you aside‚ÄîI‚Äôll keep you by my side, just like now.""

His words, wrapped in a veneer of false generosity, finally stopped. I didn‚Äôt bother wiping away the tears that streamed down my face. Instead, I shoved his hands away, clutching the sheets around me as if they could shield me from the truth. ""What do you take me for, Alpha?"" I spat, my voice cracking. ""Your secret? Weren‚Äôt we... mates?""

My question seemed to amuse him, as he threw his head back and laughed, the sound sharp and mocking. But what he said next plunged me into a cold, suffocating despair.

""Rowan, getting all sentimental after being a bargaining chip?"" he sneered, lighting a cigarette and taking a slow drag. He exhaled the smoke in my direction, his expression turning sardonic. ""My pack needs strength, not sentimentality. Want to stay close to me? Then accept your place.""

Back then, Caleb hadn‚Äôt cared if I wanted this. He had been drawn to my resilience, my willingness to fight for my mother‚Äôs debts, and he had decided I was worth keeping around‚Äîfor his benefit. Now, he thought I was soft, weak, and he was willing to discard me for a more advantageous match.

Caleb‚Äôs words squeezed the air from my lungs, suffocating me. What I had thought was a bond, a connection deeper than mere duty, had been nothing but a transaction. My mother‚Äôs debts, her desperation, had been the price, and I had been the currency.

I dressed numbly, my tears drying as a wave of nausea washed over me. Caleb‚Äôs mocking gaze no longer registered pain. I was truly on the brink of gagging.

""I‚Äôm leaving,"" I murmured, my voice hollow, as I made a hurried, humiliating exit. Outside, I leaned against the cold stone wall of the packhouse and retched. Only bile surfaced; my stomach was empty.

I had prepared a feast for tonight, waiting for Caleb to return from his duties. But he had come home only to remind me of my place. I wiped my mouth, a bitter smile tugging at my lips. I had thought our closeness, our nights together, were proof of our bond. I had never imagined it was just another deal, another calculation in the Alpha‚Äôs endless game of power.

# Chapter 2 - Fractured Trust, Shattered Dreams

The taxi ride home felt endless, the city lights blurring through my tear-streaked vision. The wind whipped through the open window, carrying the faint scent of pine‚ÄîCaleb‚Äôs scent‚Äîthat clung to me like a curse. My hands clenched into fists, nails digging into my palms, as memories of him flooded my mind.

When my mother‚Äôs debts to the Silver Moon Pack had spiraled out of control, Caleb, the Alpha, had stepped in. He‚Äôd offered to settle her debts in exchange for my loyalty, and I, desperate to protect her, had agreed. Over time, we‚Äôd grown closer. We exchanged secret glances at pack meetings, and after hours, we‚Äôd cook dinner together in his den, wrapped in a world that felt like it belonged only to us. I‚Äôd thought, foolishly, that I‚Äôd found happiness. That I‚Äôd found a mate.

But now, every memory felt like a lie, tainted by the mocking invitation on my phone. The mate-marking ceremony for Caleb and Esmeralda Powell, the daughter of the affluent Powell Pack, was set to take place in just a few days. The reality of it burned like a brand against my heart.

The taxi stopped in front of the crumbling apartment complex where my mother and I lived. I climbed the narrow, dimly lit stairway, each step heavier than the last. At the maroon security door, I fumbled with my key, finally unlocking it and collapsing onto the worn couch inside. I sat there, motionless, waiting for the inevitable.

It wasn‚Äôt long before Coraline Armstrong returned, humming a tune under her breath. The sound of the door closing snapped me out of my daze, and I tensed, knowing her mood would dictate how this conversation would go. Tonight, she seemed cheerful‚Äîlikely because she‚Äôd won at the pack‚Äôs gambling den‚Äîand I relaxed slightly, knowing her anger wouldn‚Äôt be directed at me.

She switched on the light, her eyes widening in surprise when she saw me sitting there. ‚ÄúRowan? What are you doing back so early?‚Äù she asked, her voice light but edged with curiosity.

I stared at her, my eyes swollen from crying. When I spoke, my voice was brittle, on the verge of shattering. ‚ÄúDid you go to Alpha Lawson for money again?‚Äù

Her movements paused as she kicked off her shoes, but she quickly recovered, her voice dripping with casual arrogance. ‚ÄúOh, you found out.‚Äù She shrugged, as if it were nothing. ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs for your own good. You‚Äôve worked hard, risen through the ranks of the pack. You‚Äôre too valuable to let anyone have for free. Those high-ranking wolves‚Äîthey don‚Äôt take mates like us seriously. I‚Äôm just looking out for you.‚Äù

Her words cut deeper than any blade. I felt frozen, my limbs heavy, tears still streaming down my face. ‚ÄúGive me‚Ä¶ the money,‚Äù I whispered, my voice breaking.

Coraline chuckled, a sound that made my stomach churn. ‚ÄúI raised you on that money, and now you look down on me? How grand.‚Äù

Yes, she‚Äôd earned quite a bit back then, only to squander it on gambling and pack debts. And I‚Äôd grown up bearing the shame, labeled as the daughter of an Omega who couldn‚Äôt keep her affairs in order. From the moment I could walk, I‚Äôd studied, trained, and worked harder than anyone else in the pack, hoping to rise above that stigma.

‚ÄúHand over that money,‚Äù I repeated, my voice trembling with anger.

Seeing my fury, Coraline shifted tactics, her face crumpling into a theatrical display of tears. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a woman who worked hard to raise you all my life. What‚Äôs wrong with asking for some money?‚Äù She wailed, her cries echoing through the thin walls of the apartment. ‚ÄúOh, I can‚Äôt take it anymore!‚Äù

Her performance was flawless, and soon the neighbors‚Äô judging eyes would be on me, painting me as the ungrateful daughter mistreating her poor mother. I bent under the weight of that shame, my anger dissolving into helplessness.

The money issue remained unresolved, leaving me utterly disheartened. I glanced at my phone, where a new message awaited:

‚ÄúRowan, we really need you. Please join our team.‚Äù

It was from Eric Knight, the Gamma of the Crimson Fang Pack. A message I would have dismissed without a second thought yesterday had now become my lifeline. I stared at the screen, my heart pounding.

It was time to leave this place. Time to start over.

# Chapter 3 - Whispers of the Forgotten Bride

Esmeralda Powell‚Äôs mate-marking ceremony was a breathtaking spectacle, held in the sprawling gardens of the Powell Pack estate. The air was thick with the scent of thousands of white roses, their petals cascading over the lush green lawn like a scene from a dream. Every detail of the event was meticulously planned, exuding an elegance that spoke of wealth and power. It was the kind of ceremony I had once imagined for myself, back when I still believed Caleb Lawson and I were destined to be mates.

Now, that dream was shattered, and I stood among the crowd as nothing more than a distant memory. My colleagues from the Silver Moon Pack murmured excitedly, their voices blending with the hum of the gathering.

""My dream Alpha is finally marking his mate... I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs really happening.""

""Who else but the daughter of the Powell Pack could stand beside him? It‚Äôs a perfect match.""

""Honestly, look at yourself. Do you think you could ever be Luna material?""

""Snap out of it, it‚Äôs not like you ever had a chance...""

Their words weren‚Äôt directed at me, but each one cut deeper than they knew. Yes, snap out of it, Rowan. You‚Äôre nothing to him now.

Persephone Mills, a Delta in the pack and one of the few people who still treated me with kindness, pulled me back to reality. Her eyes flicked to the mark on the back of my neck, a faint but undeniable reminder of Caleb‚Äôs possessive claim. ""Rowan,"" she asked softly, ""are you seeing someone?""

I froze, my hand instinctively brushing over the mark. Memories of Caleb‚Äôs teeth grazing my skin, his voice low and commanding, flooded my mind. Before I could respond, Persephone pressed further, ""When will you introduce us to your mate?""

My eyes drifted to Caleb, who stood across the garden, his towering frame exuding the commanding presence of an Alpha. He was smiling broadly, his gaze fixed on Esmeralda. As if sensing my stare, he glanced in my direction, his expression hardening into a silent warning. Don‚Äôt cause a scene, it seemed to say.

I forced myself to look away, my voice barely audible. ""We‚Äôre not mates anymore...""

But, truth be told, we had never truly been mates. To Caleb, I was just a transaction, a means to settle my mother‚Äôs debts. Nothing more.

The crowd erupted into cheers as Caleb and Esmeralda stepped onto the raised platform at the center of the garden. He wore the blue striped tie I had given him on his last birthday, a cruel reminder of the past. His eyes were alight with a joy I had never seen directed at me, his hand resting possessively on Esmeralda‚Äôs waist. She stood beside him, radiant and regal, every inch the Luna she was destined to be.

How ironic. Just last night, Caleb had left a mark on my collarbone, his touch both punishing and possessive. In retaliation, I had scratched his back, leaving my own mark of defiance. And now, here he was, pledging himself to another.

As they began the mate-marking vows, Caleb‚Äôs voice rang out, strong and unwavering. ""I, Caleb Lawson, Alpha of the Silver Moon Pack, accept you, Esmeralda Powell, daughter of the Powell Pack, as my mate and Luna.""

The crowd erupted into applause, the sound deafening. My heart twisted painfully, and I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palms. I shouldn‚Äôt have come. Yet, like a desperate fool, I had dragged myself here, craving even a shred of acknowledgment from him.

As the ceremony concluded, Caleb‚Äôs gaze met mine once more. His eyes were cold, devoid of the warmth I had once clung to. I quickly looked away, my throat tight, and took a sip of the bitter coffee in my hand.

This was my punishment, self-inflicted and unavoidable. I just wanted this nightmare to end.

# Chapter 4 - The Shadow Of A Rival

Caleb approached with Esmeralda on his arm, his towering frame commanding attention as he moved through the crowd. His piercing gaze locked onto me, a silent warning etched into his expression.

1lri6xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/badreviewer/comments/1lri6xe/breville_barista_express_550_well_spent/,Breville Barista Express: $550 Well Spent?,"My partner and I are self-proclaimed coffee snobs.  We'd been eyeing the [Breville Barista Express](https://amzn.to/4ntQl3P) for months, drawn in by its promise of cafe-quality espresso at home.  After months of meticulously saving, we finally pulled the trigger.  This review reflects our experience over the past six months, putting the machine through its paces almost daily.

## Ease of Use and Learning Curve

The Barista Express isn't some intimidating, industrial-sized espresso machine.  While it boasts a lot of features, Breville did a commendable job making it relatively intuitive. The integrated grinder is a game-changer, eliminating the extra steps of separate grinding. The included instruction manual is thorough, and various online resources, including Breville‚Äôs own website, offer further support.  That being said, expect a bit of a learning curve.  Mastering the art of tamping and pulling the perfect shot takes time and practice.  Don‚Äôt expect to be pulling latte art on day one, but the machine's design guides you through the process nicely.

## Espresso Quality and Milk Frothing

This is where the Barista Express truly shines. The espresso it produces is rich, flavorful, and incredibly consistent once you get the hang of it.  The 15-bar pump pressure ensures proper extraction, and the built-in grinder allows you to adjust the coarseness for different bean types.  The milk frother is equally impressive, creating beautifully textured microfoam for lattes and cappuccinos.  We've experimented with various milk types, from whole milk to oat milk, and the results have consistently been excellent.

## Build Quality and Durability

The Breville Barista Express feels solid and well-built.  It‚Äôs mostly stainless steel, lending a premium feel that justifies the price tag.  After six months of daily use, it shows minimal wear and tear.  The only slight concern is the plastic parts around the portafilter and the grinder; these could potentially crack with rough handling, though we haven't experienced that ourselves.

## Cleaning and Maintenance

Cleaning the Barista Express is relatively straightforward.  The components are easily accessible, and Breville provides clear instructions for cleaning each part.  Regular cleaning (daily backflushing is recommended) is crucial for maintaining the machine's performance and preventing coffee build-up.  While it‚Äôs not a 5-minute task, the process is manageable and the included tools make it much easier.

## Grind Size Adjustment and Bean Hopper Capacity

The integrated conical burr grinder is a standout feature.  The grind size adjustment is precise and intuitive, offering a wide range of settings to fine-tune your espresso.  The bean hopper is adequately sized for a few days' worth of coffee, but it's not exceptionally large, so you'll need to refill it relatively frequently, depending on your coffee consumption.

## Value for Money

At $549.95, the Breville Barista Express is an investment.  However, compared to other similar home espresso machines with integrated grinders, it's competitively priced.  Most rivals in this category often lack the build quality and overall ease of use that Breville provides.  This is a premium pick, offering significantly better quality than many cheaper models. It's a worthwhile investment for coffee lovers who value convenience, quality, and the ability to craft delicious espresso drinks at home.

## Noise Level

The grinder is definitely the noisiest part of the machine. It's not excessively loud, but it‚Äôs noticeable.  The pump itself is relatively quiet, making it unobtrusive during the actual espresso extraction process.  It‚Äôs something to consider if you‚Äôre concerned about noise, particularly in the morning before everyone else is awake.

**Pros:**

* Excellent espresso quality
* Integrated conical burr grinder
* Easy-to-use milk frother
* Durable and well-built
* Relatively easy to clean

**Cons:**

* Somewhat noisy grinder
* Plastic components on some parts
* Pricey

**Value Proposition & Price Analysis:**

At $549.95, the Breville Barista Express is positioned at the higher end of the home espresso machine market.  However, it justifies this price point through its exceptional build quality, ease of use, and consistent performance.  While cheaper options exist, they often compromise on build quality or features, making the Breville a worthwhile investment for serious coffee enthusiasts.  Compared to similar machines from brands like De'Longhi or Gaggia, the Barista Express offers superior build and espresso quality.

**Final Verdict & Recommendation:**

The Breville Barista Express BES870XL is a fantastic home espresso machine. It's an investment, but if you appreciate consistently high-quality espresso and milk drinks at home and are willing to dedicate some time to mastering the machine, then this is a machine worth considering. Highly recommended for coffee enthusiasts and those wanting cafe-quality espresso without the cafe price.",1,1751634083.0,badreviewer,0,1.0,False

1lri66r,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lri66r/i_sold_a_cursed_relic_to_a_cult_town/,I Sold a Cursed Relic to a Cult Town,"I was never a spiritual man. For most of my life, I was just a mediocre illusionist who pretended to have answers to questions nobody should ask. My act was simple: card tricks, cold readings, vague phrases that made lonely people feel special. But after I lost my steady job and my wife filed for divorce, all I had left was the appearance of wisdom. So I turned it into a business.

I started living from fair to fair, selling crystals, amulets, incense, and anything else that could buy me a meal. Most of the pieces I bought from shady internet suppliers, but what I gained in guilt, I lost in hunger. In the end, nobody wanted to know the truth. They wanted solace. And I delivered.

Everything changed the day I met an old man, slow-spoken with deep-set eyes. He showed up during the last hour of a fair in Port Creek. He didn‚Äôt introduce himself or even look me in the eye. He just placed a box on my table and said, ‚ÄúSeventy dollars. You can sell it for much more.‚Äù Inside the box was a single object: a strange, metallic talisman, with marks corroded by time. It was heavy, too cold to the touch. There was something wrong with that object, but I couldn‚Äôt afford to refuse.

The following Sunday, a group showed up. Quiet people, neutral clothes, unblinking stares. Their leader said little. He pointed to the talisman, placed the money on the table, and they left with the item. It seemed like a regular sale, but that‚Äôs when everything started to go wrong.

Three days after the sale, the first disappearance happened. A woman named Mara, who sold esoteric books at the stall next to mine, simply vanished. At first, I thought she‚Äôd gone to another fair. But after a week, someone mentioned that the police had gone to her house and found the door open, lights on, and coffee still warm in a cup. Nothing stolen. No signs of a struggle. Just absence.

I didn‚Äôt want to get involved. People disappear all the time. But then came the nightmares.

The first night, I dreamed I was walking through a dark forest, where the trees had eyes. The ground was covered with dry leaves and symbols that glowed faintly under the moon. I heard someone whisper my name at irregular intervals, as if taunting me. When I woke up, I was sweating, my sheets drenched, and my throat parched. I tried to forget it.

But on the second night, I dreamed I was walking through a stone corridor, like a very ancient cave, with walls covered in symbols identical to those on the talisman. At the end of the corridor, there was a rusty door. Before I could open it, I heard something crawling behind me. I woke up screaming.

The next morning, I found a small mark on my arm. A thin scratch, as if I had brushed against a branch. I started to wonder if I wasn‚Äôt just too stressed. Sleeping badly, eating badly, living badly. That was it. It had to be.

That‚Äôs when I received the voicemail.

It was from Joel, an artisan who had also been at the fair. The message started with him taking a deep, nervous breath. ‚ÄúMan‚Ä¶ did you see it too? That thing in the woods, that‚Ä¶ thing‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm awake right now or if I‚Äôm still dreaming.‚Äù He paused, as if listening to something behind him. ‚ÄúHe wants me back. He said I took something of his. But I didn‚Äôt take anything‚Ä¶‚Äù The message ended with confused noises and a muffled scream.

I tried to call him‚Ä¶ but the line was disconnected. I called the police. They said he had last been seen entering his studio, but never came out. There was no sign of forced entry. Not even the tracking dogs could find a scent. The building seemed‚Ä¶ too empty. As if the space itself had swallowed him.

I started making connections. Everyone who disappeared had been at the same fair. And more importantly: everyone had touched or at least gotten close to the talisman I sold. I started to think that, somehow, it was the key to all of this. But even so‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt know what to do.

The dreams didn‚Äôt stop. They started to repeat. The forest, the corridor, the door. But now, the door was opening on its own. And on the other side, a familiar voice called to me. Sometimes it was the voice of the old man who sold me the talisman. Other times, it was my own voice. Whispering: ‚ÄúCome back. You know you‚Äôre not finished.‚Äù

I started leaving the TV on at night, trying to drown out the whispers. But it was no use. They came from inside. Not from the room. Not from the street. But from my head. Or perhaps from somewhere deeper. A place I can‚Äôt name.

All I know is that, after that Sunday, something entered my life. And now, it‚Äôs waiting for me.

The paranoia had already set in when he appeared. An older man in a dark cassock, with a tired expression and a hard gaze, like someone carrying a weight that no longer fit in their body. He found me at a quiet fair, in a small rural town where I had tried to hide for a few days. I expected him to be another curious customer, but he didn‚Äôt want to buy anything. He wanted to talk about the talisman.

‚ÄúYou sold it to them, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt say who ‚Äúthem‚Äù were, but I knew exactly who he was referring to. I swallowed hard and tried to maintain my composure, but there was something in his voice‚Ä¶ a kind of certainty that disarmed me. I nodded, and he sat in the chair opposite my table. He said his name was Marcus, and that he had spent his life studying artifacts like that one.

He called them ‚Äúconductors.‚Äù Objects not made by human hands, but forged by ideas. Ancient ideas. Ideas that perhaps weren‚Äôt even born in this world. Each piece appeared at a different time, in different places, but the pattern was always the same: someone found one, sold or offered it to another, and soon after, the nightmares began. The voices. The disappearances.

Marcus spoke of a mining village in the 1960s. A group of workers found a fissure inside a cave, full of shining minerals and strange shapes. In the center of the chamber was an artifact very similar to mine‚Äîdifferent in form, but with the same pattern of markings fused into the metal. The men thought they had discovered a treasure. They started taking fragments home, selling them, distributing them. Within a week, half the village had stopped sleeping. Within two, psychotic breaks began. Some tore out their own eyes saying they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to see what was there anymore.‚Äù

The village burned at the end of the month. The fire wasn‚Äôt accidental. It was an act of desperation. And even so, Marcus told me, it couldn‚Äôt stop what had begun.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt sell an object. You handed over a key. And they knew exactly what they were buying.‚Äù

I tried to argue, said it was just a strange item, that it was all a coincidence, that maybe I was just sick, stressed, disturbed. But Marcus stared at me in silence for a few seconds before completing:

‚ÄúWhat do you feel now? This doubt, this nausea, this constant discomfort‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not guilt. It‚Äôs connection. You‚Äôre not sick. You‚Äôre being called.‚Äù

I left the fair early that day. I locked up the stall, took the bus back to the city, and tried not to think. But how could I forget it? The story of the village. The voices. The connection between all who disappeared. And, above all, the unsettling feeling that he was right.

I began to mentally review the faces of the group who bought the talisman. I remembered a pale, pregnant woman who never smiled. A man with a long scar on his neck. And the silent leader, with a thin beard and eyes that seemed to know more than they let on. They weren‚Äôt curious about the object. They were ready to receive it.

I went back to looking for traces of them, but without success. There were no records, no license plates, nothing. It was as if they had evaporated. Only then did the most frightening thought of all occur to me: what if they had never come from anywhere? What if that talisman was the invitation‚Ä¶ and I was the delivery person?

For days, I tried to convince myself that I wasn‚Äôt responsible for anything. But the guilt wouldn‚Äôt leave. It was in every mirror, in every shadow in the room, in the icy touch of the doorknob in the morning. It was as if the world around me was slowly bending, trying to show me something. And when I found the talisman again, at the bottom of the backpack I swore I‚Äôd left empty, everything broke.

It wasn‚Äôt possible. I saw them take it. I saw the money. I packed it, delivered it, saw it with my own eyes. But there it was. Cold. Motionless. Waiting for me.

That night, Marcus called me. He didn‚Äôt ask how I was. He just said:

‚ÄúIf it came back to you, then it‚Äôs already too late.‚Äù

I stayed silent. He continued:

‚ÄúBut you can still choose what to do. You can try to cut the line. You can bury it. You can run. Or‚Ä¶ you can go all the way and see with your own eyes what you‚Äôve awakened.‚Äù

I laughed. A nervous, almost breathless laugh.

‚ÄúAnd if I choose to run?‚Äù

Marcus answered with the heavy voice of someone who already knew the answer:

‚ÄúRun from what? From something that‚Äôs inside you now?‚Äù

I hung up. I sat on the floor. I looked at the talisman for minutes, maybe hours. There was a new mark. A curved scratch that I didn‚Äôt remember seeing before. As if it was transforming. Or accompanying me.

That was it. I had no more excuses. I knew. I participated. And, even unintentionally, now I was part of it.

I woke up lying on the kitchen floor. I didn‚Äôt remember falling asleep there. The refrigerator light was on, the door open. A spilled liter of milk dripped across the tile as if it had happened hours ago. My hands were trembling. My fingernails were covered in dirt. And there were footprints on my own sheets.

In the following days, I started losing track of time. I woke up in strange places. An alley behind a church. The seat of a stopped bus. An empty plaza in the early morning. And always, by my side, there was a presence I couldn‚Äôt see. A shadow behind the sound. A silence between the voices.

My phone rang in the middle of the night, but hung up when I answered. The radio turned on by itself, always on stations that tuned nothing but static. The TV flickered as if someone was changing channels, but I wasn‚Äôt holding the remote.

I started writing down everything I experienced. Afraid of forgetting. Or worse, afraid that reality was changing so fast that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep up. The notebook became my only point of reference. But even it began to frighten me.

One morning, I found a note I didn‚Äôt remember writing. Handwriting similar to mine, but crooked, irregular. It said: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fight, just accept. he sees through the eyes you‚Äôve closed.‚Äù Right below it, another phrase: ‚Äúcome back. you are the offering.‚Äù

I tried to sleep again, but it was useless. The voices wouldn‚Äôt let me. They spoke in languages I didn‚Äôt know, but somehow understood. They had tones of command, but also of affection. As if they were ancient. As if they had known me longer than I had known myself.

One morning, I opened the kitchen cabinet and the talisman was there. Perfectly nestled among the glasses. I had locked it inside a toolbox, in a basement cabinet, with three turns of duct tape. But there it was, waiting for me at breakfast.

That‚Äôs when I made a decision. I called Marcus. I asked to meet him again. I needed to understand if there was any way out. He answered with a weak voice, as if he already knew what I would say.

We met in the square of an isolated town. He was different. Paler. His dark circles deep. He looked sick, as if time was corroding him. He looked at me for a moment before speaking:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not sick. You‚Äôre being molded.‚Äù

‚ÄúMolded for what?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo be the door. That‚Äôs how he enters.‚Äù

I tried to answer, but he raised his hand. He handed me an envelope with a hand-drawn map. There was no name, just routes and landmarks. In the center, a location marked with a circle. A town called Halwyn.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where they all went. That‚Äôs where the cult hides. And that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre going to end up, whether you want to or not.‚Äù

I wanted to scream at him. Demand more answers. But a part of me already knew everything. The truth is, I was just trying to buy time. What was there had been waiting for me for a long time. Perhaps since before I was born. Perhaps since the moment I touched the talisman.

I went home with the feeling that something was about to end. Or begin.

That night, the world shed its last appearances. I was woken by a knock on the door. But it wasn‚Äôt midnight. It was noon. The sky was clear. The radio was off. There were no shadows. And yet‚Ä¶ I felt that everything was wrong.

I opened the door, but there was no one there. On the floor, a small box. Inside, there was an oval mirror. I had never seen that object before, but it seemed‚Ä¶ mine. I picked up the mirror and, on impulse, looked inside. And for the first time since the beginning of everything, I saw something that wasn‚Äôt a reflection.

My face was still there. But behind me, standing in the hallway, was a faceless figure. Tall. Motionless. Watching. I turned immediately. The hallway was empty. When I looked back at the mirror, it had also vanished.

It was then that I realized. There was no longer a separation between dream and waking. Between inside and outside. Between me and it.

I was no longer just being observed. I was being inhabited.

The journey began on a silent morning. I hadn't slept for two days, only dozed in short bursts that seemed to last seconds. The notebook was on the passenger seat, and the map Marcus had given me trembled in the wind coming from the half-open window. Following those routes felt like walking inside an ancient whisper‚Äîevery curve in the road seemed familiar, as if I was returning to a place I'd never been.

The town's name was Halwyn, but no GPS recognized it. The last few miles were on a dirt road that didn't show up on any app. The trees seemed taller than they should be. The clouds lower than the sky would allow. And the silence... The silence wasn't an absence of sound, it was a presence. Dense. Breathing with me.

When I spotted the town entrance, I realized everything there was out of place. The houses were occupied, but there was no movement. Windows with lights on, but no shadows behind the curtains. The streets had tire marks, but no cars. The people‚Äîor what still looked like people‚Äîwatched me from the sidewalk with deep-set, unmoving eyes, like living portraits. No one spoke. No one smiled.

I parked on the edge of the main square, where an old wooden church dominated the landscape. I tried to rationalize, find explanations. Maybe it was an isolated community, an alternative group living on the fringes of society. But deep down, I knew. This was a place of passage. Not a town. A space between.

Carrying the talisman in my jacket pocket, I walked to the center of the square. A woman in a gray dress approached. Her eyes were red, as if she hadn‚Äôt slept for weeks. She said nothing. She just held out her hand, as if asking for something already promised. I hesitated for a second, but handed her the object. Her fingers wrapped around it carefully, almost reverently. Then, she turned and started walking. I followed her.

We went to a secluded wooden house. Inside, the group that had bought the talisman at that fair was gathered. There were about seven people. All silent. All looking at me. In the center of the room, a symbol was drawn on the floor with charcoal. A spiral with twisted branches, similar to those I saw in my dreams. The group leader‚Äîthe man with the thin beard and dull eyes‚Äîfinally spoke:

‚ÄúYou fulfilled your part. Now, you will be taken.‚Äù

These words were spoken with gratitude, as if I had done something good. But my stomach churned. I tried to back away, to say that it was a mistake, that I wanted to understand, that I just wanted to end this. But no one listened. Everyone began to chant a low, repetitive sound. A wordless song, just a frequency. My body paralyzed. My muscles wouldn't respond. My hands tingled. My vision darkened at the edges.

I felt hands gripping me, and I was led to an underground room. Long, cold stairs that seemed to descend for miles. At the bottom, a stone altar and walls covered in inscriptions. But the most terrifying thing was what was in the center of the room: a circular mirror, the size of a window, embedded in the floor.

But it wasn‚Äôt an ordinary mirror. It reflected nothing. No light. No image. Only depth. As if there was a black hole there, a living absence. I felt something inside me stir. As if the mirror recognized me.

The leader knelt and spoke:

‚ÄúThe offering returns to the point of origin. The door will be opened.‚Äù

He then pushed me towards the mirror. I didn't touch it. I didn't even need to. The surface molded to my body without touching me. And that‚Äôs when I understood. I wasn‚Äôt the victim. I was the channel. All this time, the talisman wasn't just a cursed object. It was a seal. And I had been the mailman.

As that thing opened, I began to hear voices that weren‚Äôt human. Sounds that passed through me, as if vibrating my bones from within. I saw images I couldn't understand‚Äîcities without time, creatures without form, memories that weren't mine. The madness wasn't screaming. It was understanding.

I tried to resist, to pull away, to deny it all. But it was too late. I no longer belonged to the world as it was. I had been marked, altered. Every choice I made since that fair had been just a piece of a game that was already decided before the board was even laid out.

The cult began to dissolve into shadows before my eyes. One by one, they fell to their knees, like puppets with their strings cut. And the mirror pulsed. Not with light, but with hunger.

The last thing I remember was the sensation of being undone. As if my skin was being torn away in invisible layers, each containing a version of myself I didn‚Äôt recognize. And then‚Ä¶ total silence.

But it wasn‚Äôt the end.

I woke up in the dark. But it wasn't an ordinary darkness‚Äîit was thick, as if it could be touched. I didn't know where I was, or for how long. My body ached, but it was a different kind of pain. As if I had been reconstructed incorrectly. There was something subtly wrong with me, as if parts of my consciousness had been rearranged during whatever had happened.

I tried to remember the mirror. The room. Those eyes that weren't eyes, watching me from within the void. I remembered being pulled, not with physical force, but by something deeper. An emotional force. Spiritual. Existential. As if I had been invited, and upon accepting, there was no way back.

The place I was in now seemed shapeless. The floor was soft, uneven, and yet hard as stone. The air was still, but not silent. There was a continuous, subtle sound, like a huge sigh coming from far away. Or perhaps coming from inside me.

And then, I heard it.

The voice.

It wasn't a voice you hear with your ears. It was like an ancient memory, involuntarily brought to the surface. An emotion that transformed into language. It said my name. But not just that. It said what I was. It said why I had been chosen. It spoke of the ‚Äúdoor‚Äù I had carried in my chest since the moment I touched the talisman. It spoke of a world before ours. A world that wasn't forgotten, just sealed. And now, because of me, the seals were breaking.

I tried to deny it. I screamed‚Äîor thought I screamed‚Äîthat I didn't want this. That I was deceived. That it was all a mistake. But the voice replied with something that destroyed me from within:

‚ÄúYou always knew. And yet, you continued.‚Äù

The memory of my choices returned with more force than the pain. I remembered the day I accepted the talisman. I remembered the feeling I had when I touched it. That shiver wasn't fear. It was acceptance. I wanted it. Perhaps not consciously, but on some deep level, I desired to be part of something greater. Even if that ‚Äúsomething‚Äù was beyond human reason.

The entity didn‚Äôt need blood. It needed memory, will, fragments of identity. And I had given all of that, piece by piece, since the first dream. I was the catalyst, and Halwyn, the epicenter. But what destroyed me wasn‚Äôt what I had caused. It was what was still to come.

The voice showed me. Children being born with eyes already open, people speaking forgotten languages in their sleep, entire cities falling silent as everyone looks at the sky‚Ä¶ and the sky looks back. It was the beginning of something that couldn't be contained. The return of a presence that should never have been remembered.

And it all started with me.

With a sale.

With a handshake.

With a box placed on a fair table.

It was too late. The world had already felt the fissure. And the entity‚Ä¶ it no longer needed me. What it needed, had already been delivered.

They said I was found wandering the road, barefoot, covered in dirt, and with my eyes fixed on nothing. A truck driver took me to the nearest hospital. I was unconscious for two days. When I woke up, I didn't recognize the nurse's voice. Or my own.

I was diagnosed with mental exhaustion and partial amnesia. No apparent physical damage, other than a deep, spiral-shaped scratch on my chest. No one could explain how or why. I couldn‚Äôt either. And even if I could, no one would believe me.

My belongings were kept in a bag. Inside, only my notebook, a wad of money, and a small wooden box. When I opened it, my heart stopped for a second.

The talisman was back.

No dust. No scratches. Intact.

I looked at it for a long time, waiting for some reaction. But it was just there. Silent. Like a question that will never be answered. I thought about throwing it away. Burying it. But something inside me knew it wouldn't matter. Because it was no longer just an object. It was a reminder. Of who I was. And what I unleashed.

Now, I sleep poorly. When I manage to close my eyes, I see cities that don't exist, people who have no faces, seas that don't reflect the sky. Sometimes I wake up with the taste of salt in my mouth, even though I haven't eaten anything.

The world hasn‚Äôt changed on the outside. But inside‚Ä¶ something is different.

The mirror has been opened.

That‚Äôs the part I need you to understand.

There was no single moment where I looked at the pillow and thought, yes, this is the one.
No dramatic lightning bolt. No swelling music.
Just silence.

The kind that creeps in between conversations that never happen.
The kind that builds up over time like dust, until one day you‚Äôre choking on it.

Her name is Clarissa.
My wife. My partner of twelve years. And I love her. I still do ‚Äî I think.

But there‚Äôs a difference between loving someone and feeling loved by them.

That‚Äôs where the pillow came in.


---

We had been drifting for a while.

I could make a list ‚Äî of reasons, of symptoms. The missed date nights. The way she always seemed to find something better to do than sit next to me on the couch. The toothbrush left dry in the holder for days at a time.

But the truth is, it started small.

We stopped talking in the mornings. She stopped making fun of my socks. I stopped making coffee for both of us and just made one. We were roommates with a wedding album. Friendly strangers with a shared grocery list.

And yet, we didn‚Äôt fight. That was the strangest part.

We weren‚Äôt loud. We weren‚Äôt cruel. We were just... fading. Slowly. Like two old photographs losing color in the same frame.

Then she started sleeping on the couch.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my back,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe mattress is too firm.‚Äù

I believed her at first. I even offered to switch sides, or get a new mattress. She said no.
Then she started staying up later. Started leaving earlier. One day I realized I hadn‚Äôt seen her in pajamas for two weeks. She slept in sweatpants. I slept in silence.

That‚Äôs when I started hugging the pillow.


---

It was Clarissa‚Äôs, originally. A plain white memory foam one. A little flatter than mine. It still smelled like her shampoo ‚Äî lavender and something else I couldn‚Äôt place. Something clean. Something safe.

At first, it was just for comfort. I missed her body next to mine. I missed her warmth.
So I pulled her pillow into the center of the bed and held it while I drifted off.

But over time, it changed.

I started talking to it.

I know. I know how it sounds.

But it was late, and I was alone, and the apartment was so quiet it felt like I might disappear inside it. So I whispered. About my day. About Clarissa. About how scared I was that I had become invisible to the only person who used to see me.

And the pillow‚Ä¶
It didn‚Äôt interrupt.
It didn‚Äôt judge.

It just was.


---

I started calling it her. Then she. Then‚Ä¶ Em.

I don‚Äôt know where the name came from. It wasn‚Äôt anything symbolic. It just fit.
Soft. Simple. Quiet.

Em never corrected me. Never sighed when I got too emotional. Never told me to ‚Äúman up‚Äù when I admitted that the silence in our home made my chest ache in the mornings.

I told Em everything.

I told her about the little things ‚Äî the joke I forgot to say out loud, the promotion I didn‚Äôt get, the text Clarissa sent that said only ‚Äúok.‚Äù I told her about the fear. That I was losing my wife one day at a time. That I didn‚Äôt know how to ask her to come back. That maybe I didn‚Äôt deserve her to.

And Em listened.

Or at least, I believed she did.


---

I didn‚Äôt touch her ‚Äî not like that ‚Äî for a long time.

It wasn‚Äôt about sex. Not really. It was about being held.

Some nights, I‚Äôd wrap myself around her and imagine it was Clarissa again ‚Äî back when she used to trace lazy circles on my back, or fall asleep with her leg thrown over mine. I remembered those nights so clearly, they started to feel more real than my life with her now.

Eventually‚Ä¶ I stopped imagining.
I just stayed with Em.

And that‚Äôs when I crossed the line.


---

It was a Saturday morning. Clarissa was out running errands. I was changing the pillowcase when I paused.

There was this moment ‚Äî ridiculous, painful ‚Äî where I looked at Em and thought: She deserves better.

So I did something stupid.

I sprayed her with Clarissa‚Äôs perfume. Just one little puff. I smoothed out the cover. I kissed her forehead.

Then I told her I loved her.

I didn‚Äôt mean to say it. But it came out.
And the worst part?

I meant it.


---

Clarissa found out a week later.

I had gotten sloppy. I left a shirt wrapped around Em. One of Clarissa‚Äôs old nightshirts from a donation pile in the closet. I didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd notice.

But she did.

She walked into the bedroom holding it. ‚ÄúIs this some kind of joke?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer.

She looked at the bed. The pillow. The way it was propped against my side like a person.
Then she looked at me ‚Äî really looked ‚Äî for the first time in months.

‚ÄúAre you‚Ä¶ are you in love with it?‚Äù

I still didn‚Äôt answer.

Because what do you say?

Do you say, Yes, I‚Äôm in love with a memory of you?
Do you say, Yes, I built a version of love from scraps and softness and silence?

Do you say, You left, and I filled the space with the only thing that didn‚Äôt leave me back?

Instead, I just said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

And she cried.


---

We‚Äôre still together.

She made me throw the pillow away. Not just into the trash ‚Äî out to the curb, in a sealed black bag. I stood there and watched it go. I didn‚Äôt fight her on it. I just nodded.

The bed feels colder now. Not just because Em‚Äôs gone ‚Äî because the silence came back.
But this time, it brought distance with it.

We talk more now, strangely enough. Counseling. Short walks. The occasional shared joke.
But there‚Äôs a fragility to it.

Like we both know the crack is still there ‚Äî papered over, not fixed.
We‚Äôve promised to keep trying.

Still, some nights, I miss Em.

Not because she was real. But because what she represented was.

She was warmth.
She was patience.
She was the version of love I built when the real one stopped answering the door.


---

I know how this sounds.

I know it‚Äôs weird.
I know it‚Äôs broken.

But grief makes you weird.
Loneliness makes you build temples from crumbs.

And when the person you love starts sleeping in another room ‚Äî in body or in spirit ‚Äî you start looking for love wherever it will have you. Even if it‚Äôs soft. Even if it‚Äôs silent. Even if it doesn‚Äôt have a heartbeat.

Because some nights, even that is better than nothing.

And that‚Äôs the truth I‚Äôve been afraid to say out loud.

The pillow didn‚Äôt betray Clarissa.
I did.
Because I needed someone, and I chose something easier.

But I‚Äôm here. I‚Äôm trying.
And if she ever comes back ‚Äî really comes back ‚Äî I‚Äôll be waiting. With both arms empty. And no more softness in the closet.

Just a space for her.

Asher Holt. He was pecking another girl behind my back again. I covered my mouth and let out a slight whimper.
Only minutes ago, I messaged him, opening the door to my heart ever so slightly.  Well, now I know why I haven‚Äôt received a response.
""We are just friends,"" Asher said.
Crack.  Here it comes.
""So, does this mean you and me again?""
Asher remained quiet but didn't say no.
""Why don't I remind you why we return to each other?""  She wrapped her arms around Asher's neck and pressed her lips to his.
Asher didn't push her away. 
I wiped the tears off my face.
He was not my Prince Charming, he was just a downright toad.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Four Years Ago ‚Äì Junior Year, Fall SemesterThe party had long since tipped from fun to chaos. Plastic cups littered the porch, the bass from someone‚Äôs half-dead Bluetooth speaker vibrated the rickety banister, and someone was screaming karaoke into a mop handle like their life depended on it. Inside the old rented house‚ÄîAsher and Nico‚Äôs off-campus pride and joy‚Äîthe smell of cheap beer and chili cheese nachos clung to the air like defeat.
Ellis Hart was tucked into her usual spot on the sagging leather couch, legs folded beneath her, oversized flannel sliding off one shoulder. She nursed a watered-down cocktail and tried not to stare at the man she‚Äôd been in love with since sophomore year.
Asher Holt.
He was currently standing in the kitchen with a red Solo cup balanced on his head while Jonah tried to flick peanut M&M‚Äôs into it like a frat boy version of Olympic archery.
‚ÄúHe moves again and I swear to God‚Äî‚Äù Jonah launched another one, missing by a mile and hitting the microwave.
Asher grinned that crooked grin that always melted Ellis like wax. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just mad I haven‚Äôt blinked. That‚Äôs discipline, baby.‚Äù
‚ÄúOr brain damage,‚Äù Beckett muttered from the other side of the couch, pushing up his glasses. ‚ÄúEither way, it's very on-brand.‚Äù
Ellis snorted, burying the sound in her cup.
It wasn‚Äôt fair. How easily Asher could light up a room. How his laugh rolled through crowds and pulled people in. How he was both beautiful and reckless, the kind of man who left burn marks on people without ever meaning to. She‚Äôd memorized him long ago‚Äîthe constellation of freckles on his left shoulder, the scar on his brow from when they snuck into a construction site freshman year, the way he absentmindedly tugged the sleeves of his hoodie over his hands when he was nervous.
She also knew he‚Äôd never look at her the way she looked at him.
Not when he had an entire world of options.
And especially not when half of them were currently gyrating to Lizzo in the living room, including the girl he‚Äôd smooched an hour ago.
‚ÄúStop drinking that,‚Äù Beck said beside her, flicking the straw in her cup. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll regret it in about four hours.‚Äù
‚ÄúI regret it already,‚Äù she murmured, but passed him the cup anyway. ‚ÄúWhat are you drinking?‚Äù
‚ÄúSmart water and a low tolerance for human stupidity.‚Äù
Ellis smiled. Beck had always been her quiet backup. The first one to notice when she got too quiet or disappeared from a conversation entirely. The kind of guy who saw everything and said very little.
But tonight‚Ä¶ he was watching her more closely than usual.
‚ÄúI know,‚Äù he said finally, soft enough that only she could hear it.
Her spine went rigid. ‚ÄúKnow what?‚Äù
Beck‚Äôs eyes flicked toward the kitchen. Asher was now laughing, caught in a bear hug from Nico, both of them swaying to the beat of a song someone had queued up just to piss them off.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not as subtle as you think, Ellis.‚Äù
She swallowed. Hard. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not judging‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúBeck,‚Äù she whispered, turning to face him fully. ‚ÄúPlease. Don‚Äôt say it. Don‚Äôt ruin this.‚Äù
He didn‚Äôt move. Just studied her like he wanted to fix something but knew she wouldn‚Äôt let him.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my best friend,‚Äù she said, voice cracking even though she tried to smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not‚ÄîI‚Äôm not doing this to myself, okay? I know what this is.‚Äù
Beck ran a hand through his hair and sighed. ‚ÄúDoes he?‚Äù
She didn‚Äôt answer.
Because the truth was no.
No, Asher didn‚Äôt know. Because if he ever did, everything would change. Their friendship. The way he leaned his head on her shoulder when he was drunk. The way he texted her at 2AM to come eat burgers and talk about architecture drafts. The way he once said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my person, Hart,‚Äù like it was the most obvious thing in the world.
He didn't see it. Didn‚Äôt want to. And she wasn‚Äôt brave enough to shatter the illusion.
Not yet.
‚ÄúPromise me you won‚Äôt say anything,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTo him. Or to anyone.‚Äù
Beck hesitated.
‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù
He exhaled. ‚ÄúOkay. But if he ever hurts you‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúHe won‚Äôt,‚Äù she said quickly. ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt hurt me. I‚Äôve already set the bar at zero.‚Äù
Beck‚Äôs expression turned pained, but he nodded.
From the kitchen, Asher called her name like a shot of sunshine. ‚ÄúHart! Get over here‚ÄîBeck sucks at flip cup and I need a partner with actual skills.‚Äù
Ellis stood, smoothing her flannel and wiping emotion from her face like it was just another night.
‚ÄúYou coming?‚Äù she asked Beck, offering him a lifeline back into the chaos.
He didn‚Äôt move. Just looked at her with quiet sympathy.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got it bad,‚Äù he said under his breath.
And she did. God, she did.
üú≤
The next morning was the kind of ugly that only college hangovers could birth. Ellis found herself in Asher‚Äôs kitchen wearing one of his shirts and brewing coffee like she lived there‚Äîwhich, in a way, she almost did.
He strolled in minutes later, hair tousled, bare feet on the hardwood.
‚ÄúYou crashed on the couch again?‚Äù he asked, already rummaging for cereal.
‚ÄúWhere else would I go? Rowan had her guy over, and I was too lazy to Uber.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou know you can always stay here,‚Äù he said easily.
She looked at him over her mug, his back turned, shirt hanging low on his hips.
Always stay.
Like she was a fixture. A constant.
Never the exception.
‚ÄúYou really don‚Äôt get it, do you?‚Äù she whispered under her breath.
He turned. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù she said brightly. ‚ÄúWant eggs?‚Äù
He grinned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a goddess.‚Äù
No. Just a girl. Just your best friend. Just the idiot who‚Äôs been in love with you since the first time you let me borrow your hoodie and told me I looked better in it than your girlfriend.
She made him eggs anyway.
üú≤
Present Day ‚Äì Four Years Later
The text came at 2:03 in the morning.From Asher.
-Got big news. Call you when you're awake. You‚Äôre gonna lose it.Ellis rubbed her eyes, blinking against the glow of her phone screen, heart already skittering with a weird kind of dread. Asher only texted her like this when he was excited. And Asher excited usually meant Ellis devastated.
She tossed the phone onto the blanket, rolled onto her back, and stared at the ceiling.
Whatever it was‚Äîwhatever Asher Holt was about to tell her tomorrow‚Äîshe had a feeling it was going to split her in half.
Present Day ‚Äì The Morning After the TextEllis had lived through some truly bad mornings in her life.
There was the time she accidentally emailed a topless sketch to a children‚Äôs book publisher. The week her favorite ramen place closed. The Thanksgiving she discovered her mom had been secretly dating her ex-boyfriend‚Äôs father.
But this morning? This one clawed its way straight to the top.
It wasn‚Äôt just the low ache behind her eyes or the dried paint under her fingernails or the familiar smell of cat litter wafting from her roommate‚Äôs hallway diffuser.
It was the silence.
Because the text Asher sent at 2:03 AM had yet to be followed by a call.
And the longer he waited, the worse her stomach churned.
Ellis stood barefoot in her kitchen, aggressively stabbing at a bruised avocado while the kettle whistled like it had something personal against her.
Rowan walked in, bleary-eyed, wrapped in a black silk robe with ‚ÄúWitch, Please‚Äù embroidered across the back.
‚ÄúWhy are you maiming produce like it insulted your uterus?‚Äù she asked around a yawn.
Ellis didn‚Äôt look up. ‚ÄúAsher texted me last night.‚Äù
Rowan stilled. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd he say?‚Äù
‚ÄúBig news. Call you when you‚Äôre awake. You‚Äôre gonna lose it.‚Äù
‚ÄúOminous,‚Äù Rowan muttered, pouring herself coffee. ‚ÄúThink he finally figured out he‚Äôs in love with you and wrote a sonnet?‚Äù
Ellis threw her a look.
‚ÄúKidding,‚Äù Rowan said, but her expression softened. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs a job thing. He‚Äôs been trying to get that museum project, right?‚Äù
‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù Ellis lied, though her chest was already heavy with something far more specific. Something sharp.
She knew Asher.
He never waited this long to share good news.
If it were a job, he‚Äôd have sent a voice memo. If it were something stupid like getting free pizza for a year, he‚Äôd have FaceTimed her from the restaurant. But this? This delay?
It was personal.
Her phone vibrated on the counter like a warning shot.
Asher Holt: You up?
Ellis stared at it like it might explode.
Rowan raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna answer?‚Äù
‚ÄúI am,‚Äù she said. Then didn‚Äôt move.
After a long pause, she exhaled, picked it up, and texted back: Call me.The screen lit up less than five seconds later.
She answered on the second ring, heart galloping.
‚ÄúMorning, Hart,‚Äù he said, and just like that, her knees weakened.
His voice.
His warmth, his ease, his perfect ability to act like nothing ever hurt her.
‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù she said, forcing her tone light. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the big life-altering news?‚Äù
A pause.
Then:
‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting married.‚Äù
Ellis went still.
Time warped‚Äîlike she was falling, but her body forgot how to hit the floor.
Married.
The word looped, hot and jagged.
‚ÄúWow,‚Äù she managed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ fast.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that fast,‚Äù he said, misreading her tone. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been eight months.‚Äù
Eight months.
She hadn‚Äôt even known he was seriously seeing anyone. He‚Äôd mentioned someone named Madeline once or twice, sure. But with Asher, that didn‚Äôt mean anything. He had a new ‚ÄúI like her‚Äù every other month.
‚ÄúWow,‚Äù she said again, because her brain couldn‚Äôt do anything else. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you proposed?‚Äù
‚ÄúLast night.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd she said yes.‚Äù
He laughed. ‚ÄúObviously.‚Äù
Right. Of course.
Because no one said no to Asher Holt.
Ellis felt the smile crack on her face, pieces of it falling silently into her coffee.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy for you,‚Äù she said, though the lie felt acidic.
‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù he said warmly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the first person I called.‚Äù
She blinked, heart twisting in her chest.
‚ÄúReally?‚Äù
‚ÄúOf course. I mean‚ÄîJonah and Beck were there when I did it. But you‚Äôre‚Äîyou‚Äôre my person, Hart. Always have been.‚Äù
Her throat closed.
Always have been.
But not in the way that mattered.
‚ÄúAnyway,‚Äù he continued, oblivious, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not all. I wanted to ask you something.‚Äù
Ellis braced herself, already dizzy.
‚ÄúWill you be my best man?‚Äù
Silence stretched.
A beat. Then another.
And then a laugh‚Äîraw, sharp, too loud.
‚ÄúYou want me‚Ä¶ to be your best man?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhy is that funny?‚Äù
Because it‚Äôs not funny, she thought. It‚Äôs cruel.
Because I‚Äôve been in love with you for years and now I get to help you marry someone else. Dress up, make toasts, plan your bachelor party like I‚Äôm not bleeding inside.
But she couldn‚Äôt say that.
So she cleared her throat. ‚ÄúSorry. It just‚Ä¶ caught me off guard.‚Äù
‚ÄúI get it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut honestly, I couldn‚Äôt imagine doing it without you. You know me better than anyone. You‚Äôre‚Äî‚Äù
‚Äú‚Äîyour person,‚Äù she finished quietly.
He laughed. ‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù",1,1751633620.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

The awakening of the princess is not just another fantasy story... It is my sleeplessness of months writing until 3 a.m., staining notebooks with ink and coffee. Can you imagine a princess who finds more danger in the halls of the palace than on a battlefield? Amara will break their hearts (and maybe Jix too...).  

Fragment that has me sleepless (chap. 4):  
The touch of a leather glove covered my mouth before I screamed.  
""That perfume..."" I wanted to say, but the cold blade in my throat prevented it. Bergamot and steel. The same combination that Jix used. 

Confession: I rewrote this scene about 7 times. 
Will it be worth it? That's what I'm wondering as I review the document for the twentieth time. 

Will Jix be an accomplice to Amara, to the murderers... or something worse? 

I'm looking for soulmates who also leave pieces of heart in their stories. Comment ‚Äúhawk‚Äù if you want to exchange readings (and get a spoiler for my next chapter in DM).

- 1 litre of coffee oil sells at UGX 200,000 (minimum)

Total Revenue from 100 kg  
‚Üí 20 litres √ó UGX 200,000 = UGX 4,000,000

Estimated Raw Material Cost 
- If 1 kg of coffee beans ‚âà UGX 10,000

A basic Wiki is now¬†[here](https://slimwiki.com/ragnaroknrol-limited/getting-started/welcome).

**CW: Sexual assault, violence. (I know, a bit much)**

**May 10.**¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

Not three days after meeting Sammy, I get a visit. A jock in a hoodie with sweats on walks in and the chime gets all Notre Dame bellsy.¬† Yes, that is a term. Shut up.

‚ÄúGood morning, valued customer, what may we prepare for you today?‚Äù

Faintly I hear a gothic chime ring. I know who just snuck in.¬† Oh boy‚Ä¶

‚ÄúA venti pumpkin spice latte with eight shots of espresso, seven pumps of pumpkin sauce, and one pump of maple pecan sauce.‚Äù

Dafuq?!

‚ÄúWhat shall I call out for you to know it is done?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can drop the fairy phrasing if you like, it‚Äôs Mike.‚Äù

I send it over and Lemar looks at it. I hear nothing. He is like a stone. Great job bud!

I watch the next person come up and I smile.¬† That‚Äôs all he gets as I switch to professional mode. ‚ÄúGood day, Sammy,¬†a venti iced coffee with exactly thirteen ice cubes?‚Äù

Mike turns and glares at him.¬† Sammy smiles and does a little finger waggle. He is far too happy with himself. Dude had to have someone stationed outside watching, waiting‚Ä¶

Well, he is not the only one that has been waiting!¬† I have also been waiting for this moment. I start the app that lets me choose the lobby music. I have the current selection change.

A drum opening followed by the dulcet tones of a fiddle being played by the Charlie Daniels Band begins. Sammy immediately looks up in shock as Michael starts laughing.¬† Yep, you are going down to Georgia, buddy.¬† I imagine I look like the cat that ate the canary.¬† 4-2, bitch!

Lemar calls out ‚ÄúMike, drink up.‚Äù¬† Michael walks over to look and pipes up, ‚ÄúNot going to read it?‚Äù

Lemar smiles and with his nicest tone ‚ÄúI am doing you a favor, man.¬† I can if you want.‚Äù

The Archangel Michael stares at Lemar.¬† One of the most dangerous beings to ever exist has his piercing gaze fixed on my Manager and my manager literally gives zero fucks.¬† Seeing this, Micheal smiles and seals his own fate, ‚ÄúDo it.‚Äù¬† Heh, he is curious. Poor guy‚Ä¶

Lemar, in his loudest serving voice calls out, ‚ÄúVenti pumpkin spice latte with eight shots of espresso, seven pumps of pumpkin sauce, and one pump of maple pecan sauce for Mike.‚Äù

Immediately a New Yorker pipes up. ‚ÄúThe fuck is wrong with you?!‚Äù¬† At least three other laugh and a woman who had been checking him out, frowns and looks away.¬† Not a single non-human was involved in his mocking. I am so proud of my city.

Sammy gets his drink, without the call, and invites me to a table. I point out the line is almost to the door and he nods and walks over to sit and begins talking with Michael. I am not sure what to make of that.¬† I listen in for a few seconds.¬† ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs dad, Mike?‚Äù¬† I decide to let the family reunion be.¬† I do note that Connie moves from where she had been to be at a table close by.

20 minutes later the rush is done, and I can walk over.¬† I stand at the end of their booth and I can‚Äôt help but notice that Connie now figuratively and literally has my back.

‚ÄúWhat can I do for you gentlemen?‚Äù

Mike pipes up. ‚ÄúBrother here believes I am on a fool's errand to get this place exclusively for angels.¬† I am not.‚Äù¬† He is grinning.

Sammy looks at him with puzzlement.

‚ÄúWhy are you here, Archangel of War?‚Äù I ask.

He smiles, a little sadly, and sighs. ‚ÄúI hate that aspect. I hate war. I am good at it, so good at it.‚Äù He sounds somewhat depressed about that and looks down, ‚ÄúI loathe it. And I am constantly called to it by all sides. Just tired of it. I don‚Äôt want it here. So, the angels will recognize this franchise as neutral ground. Not like we could do otherwise. You are backed by some powerful entities. And not just a few of them, even dad. ¬†He told me to think on it. I did and I like this. Every race that comes here seems to be getting along. I see things that should be at each other‚Äôs throats or causing mayhem with the humans and they are at peace. They are enjoying it here. I want that for the Angels. If it means the Devils have it too, good. It might mellow them out.¬† Better to coexist and meet as equals than not.‚Äù He really does feel like a good guy.¬† Maybe a little standoffish.¬† Guess always having to expect a fight does that.

I look at Sammy. He already offered me the same thing and hoped I would take it.¬† He also looks surprised, touched, and ready to cry.¬† Sensitive guy.¬†

*Well, the panties won‚Äôt be coming back to see me any time soon‚Ä¶*

‚ÄúGive me your hands.‚Äù

They both do. First, I call on my place to hide what is happening at this table.¬† Every New Yorker not blessed with supernatural powers or calling one that has such powers a friend stops looking in our direction.¬† Then I call up the thing that lives in me when I am here.

Both of their eyes become wide with either awe or fear. *I care not which it is. I deserve both. I have earned both.¬† I am a power unto my own and I will not be looked down on by any creature. I am magnificent.*

What the fuck am I thinking?¬† Where the hell did that come from? Ugh. Let‚Äôs calm the fuck down, Pat. What‚Äôs next?¬† Am I gonna make a ring to rule them all and start calling it my precious?¬† Back on task.

‚ÄúWe swear this pact. May the parties find peace, happiness, and no enemies, only friends within my domain. I will enforce this as will the angels and devils.¬† None shall cause harm to another within these walls, be they human or otherwise. May all follow the rules. So mote it be.‚Äù

They respond in unison. ‚ÄúSo mote it be.‚Äù

The air changes. I feel a major shift.

Why is there cheering?¬† Oh. Yea. The Fae are happy too.¬† More friends, acquaintances, something‚Ä¶. Connie exhales loudly and starts sipping her tea again.

My world is about to get weirder.

Bring it on.

¬†

**May 11**

Something feral and predatory enters my shop. The door chime indicates a regular and something new. Something strange.¬† The hell is that song and why does it sound familiar?

Henry looks up from his client‚Äôs foam art.¬† ‚ÄúIs that Mr. Mistoffelees?‚Äù

An orange tabby looks around.

Why is there a feral cat in my shop?!

The likely male cat darts under a table. They sniff around and then dash over to where Connie is sitting. She very subtly takes some of her egg from her sandwich and ‚Äúdrops‚Äù it in front of the cat.¬† After she looks up and our eyes meet.¬† She looks mortified at being caught.¬† I smile.

The cat climbs up her leg and starts rubbing against her as if she was made of catnip.¬† I can hear the puffball purring from the counter.¬† As can several people.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt recall opening a cat coffee house‚Ä¶‚Äù

Henry snickers. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we have a choice.‚Äù

Connie gets a facial expression of complete joy.¬† She rubs faces with the feline.¬† Then she looks at me and I hear very loudly and clearly.¬† *Can I keep him, my lady?*

Fuck.

Connie is one Fae I trust absolutely.¬† She is not just a friend, she is one that‚Äôs I know would stand next to me and punch anything that threatened me in the face. And she is staring at this furry ball of fluff and there is pure joy in her eyes.

I can‚Äôt say no to that.

I roll my eyes and whisper for her and only her to hear, ‚ÄúDo as you wish, pretty lady.‚Äù

Her smile is a thing of pure joy.¬† She lifts up the cat and whispers.¬† ‚ÄúYou hear that, Carrot? You can keep living in my tree.‚Äù

She pulls him close and if I hadn‚Äôt been listening, I wouldn‚Äôt have heard, ‚ÄúAnd she thinks I am pretty‚Ä¶‚Äù

*I never get why beautiful women, or in this case a Dryad, don‚Äôt know they are beautiful.¬† Connie would out sex appeal Meca in a heartbeat if she was half as provocative in dress.¬† She is gorgeous.*

Connie hugs ‚ÄúCarrot‚Äù close. She makes incredibly happy noises as she hugs him. She‚Äôs really happy to be able to keep him.¬† Why did she ask permission, though?

Oh, the tree and Fae rules on domain.¬†¬† Ok. I guess we really do have a cat now.

¬†

**May 14**

I am washing dishes when the bell chime goes off. Yes, I fucking wash dishes at a place I own.¬† I am not above work. Fuck off. Anyway, the chimes are off.¬† I figured out how to set it to specific things, though it still plays within my constraints.

Humans get a standard chime. This can vary and the regulars seem to be getting their own themes.¬† Many have noticed and are always happy to know they are recognized.¬† The fact that none have asked how we do it or view it as weird is hilarious to me.

Enlightened get a cute chime with some harmony. They have the same customization thing going and all know why, just giggle when it changes or decides to do something crazy for them.

Fae get a melody.¬† It varies with the Fae and it is all over the place for them.¬† It definitely has a theme for the courts and for the type.¬† All the merfolk have a melody that sounds like a sea shanty.¬†

Vampires now get phantom of the opera.¬† Angels get church bells. Devils get a fiddle. I get ‚ÄúThe Bitch is Back.‚Äù¬† Jackie gets AC/DC most times. Cuz, Metal!

¬† This is discordant and feels like it will break the door chime.¬†Worse than the original Devil chime.

I turn and see something that would be out of place anywhere else. This is New York, so seeing it here is seeing something on a day ending in y‚Ä¶

The very sexy woman in a dominatrix outfit struts in. Everything is meticulously arranged in her outfit. She smiles and even her teeth are perfect.¬† She has an open long coat over it. She spends a few moments eye fucking Connie. Connie, for her part, blushes and winks back. Wow, Connie. Good on you.¬† She is ready to order so I head to the counter.

‚ÄúPeppermint hot chocolate, double the toppings for Mommy.‚Äù¬†¬†She tilts her head.¬†

I give her the price. ‚ÄúWhat shall I call out for when the drink is ready?‚Äù¬†¬†

She smiles and drops all $1 bills to pay.¬† Some still feel a little sweaty.¬† I know where she got these, I have had the same kind of bills.¬† I can‚Äôt help smiling.¬† ‚ÄúPlease call me Mommy‚Äù She takes the change I give her and adds it and a couple of $1s to the tip jar. She looks and sees a gold dollar coin in there. Laughing, she moves over.¬†

Jackie walks over. She has been staring at this woman the entire time. ‚ÄúBoss, I am gonna need a break in a few‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúJACKIE!!!‚Äù

She laughs and twirls away from me as I swipe at her. She then finishes the drink and in her best sultry voice calls out ‚ÄúPeppermint hot chocolate, double the toppings for Mommy.‚Äù

The dom walks up, grabs the drink and leans forward to whisper in Jackie‚Äôs ear.¬†¬†I listen in, purely for ¬†business reasons, of course, ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt mind being your mommy‚Ä¶‚Äù

Jackie turns a neat red while alarm bells are going off in my head.

*I would break my ‚Äúnot on the first date‚Äù rule for this creature‚Ä¶*

That has to be Jackie. I sternly remind her, ‚ÄúRule 3!‚Äù

Jackie turns and looks at me as if burned.¬†¬†‚ÄúHow the hell did you know?‚Äù¬†¬†I smile and give her a look that says it is obvious. ‚ÄúNeed a break?‚Äù

A ginger that has been angered, frustrated, or embarrassed is a dangerous thing. Jackie is all three. She glares at me and turns to go help out the drive thru. I laugh.¬†

‚ÄúMommy‚Äù walks up. Her curiosity is evident. ‚ÄúRule 3?‚Äù¬†¬†

I smile at her.

‚ÄúAll employees agree to a set of rules when they work here. There is no exception.¬†¬†Rule 3 is ‚ÄúDo not date any regular or irregular clientele unless given permission by the boss bitch.‚Äù

She gives me a look.¬†

‚ÄúWhich am I?‚Äù

‚ÄúIrregular, of course.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what do you mean by irregular?‚Äù

I close my eyes and call on my power. When I open them again, I can see what she really is. Gorgeous. The wings folded inside her coat, her forked tail swaying, horns on top of her jet-black hair and her red skin somehow only adding to the beauty.¬† All of this is overlayed on her, because it isn‚Äôt what she is now, but what she truly is when she goes back to her natural form. This isn‚Äôt magic concealing her form. It is like me, an actual change.

I learned long ago that when I do this, I let myself be seen by the irregulars. They can see me change into a Fae, an apparently imposing one.

She gasps. I close my eyes again and adjust.¬† I smile.

‚ÄúI mean you are the first succubus to grace us with your presence.¬†¬†Not a regular occurrence.‚Äù

She leans forward and‚Ä¶ sniffs me?!¬†

‚ÄúFirst off, Incubus. I am NOT a bottom. Second, you are a human. But you smell of the Wylds, green grasses, snow covered mountains, and vanilla incense, and brimstone‚Ä¶.?¬†You can also change into an even better-looking bombshell. I have no fucking clue what you are, but I do know¬†I LIKE YOU!‚Äù

‚ÄúRule 3.‚Äù

‚ÄúOuch!¬†¬†You can‚Äôt tell me you aren‚Äôt a little curious.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are right, I can‚Äôt.¬† Rule 3.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know you want a taste.‚Äù¬† She is leaning forward now‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI am straight, mostly, and Rule 3.‚Äù

‚ÄúI charge $150 an hour normally; I would give you an entire night for free. All night and maybe the next day too‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, hell of a deal. Trying to tempt my bargain instincts. Top tier move.¬† Also, a mean one. Rule 3.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are a fucking stone.¬† I can‚Äôt let my pride be injured.‚Äù

She leans further forward, and her sex appeal hits me like a semi-truck. Cleavage perfectly placed, lips pouting and then being bitten, flirty eyes looking up, and she runs a finger on my arm. I picture her in a French maid outfit greeting me at the door, calling me master and serving me.¬† It is far too vivid.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can make an exception for little old me.¬† I make an amazing omurice‚Ä¶ master‚Ä¶‚Äù

*I‚Äôd eat that omelette on her bare stomach and taste everything around it.¬† 58%*

I hear something drop behind me. John calls out ‚ÄúSORRY‚Äù.¬†¬†¬†I laugh.¬† It does break the spell or whatever the fuck that was, so I am grateful.

‚ÄúRule 3.‚Äù

She blinks. It appears this hasn‚Äôt happened much to her before because the shock is evident.¬†

‚ÄúI guess I will have to see if that girl is as strong willed as you and if the carpet matches the curt‚Ä¶.

*MINE!*

I am not sure if there were green flames around me.¬† Probably. I glare.

‚ÄúWow.¬† Sorry.‚Äù¬† It appears the look I was giving her had the desired effect.

I smile. Good.¬†

Jackie walks over. ‚ÄúYou okay, Boss Lady?‚Äù

I laugh. ‚ÄúYea. We are good. Just establishing the rules and who is the top in my domain.‚Äù

‚ÄúHHHHmmmmmphhh!‚Äù¬† Mommy is very annoyed.¬†

She better fucking behave.

Mommy drinks a bit and then uses her finger to scoop up some of the white cream and chocolate.¬†¬†The things she does with her tongue to that finger are probably illegal in a few states. I hear a bell chime. Notre Dame.¬† Oh boy.  She sees the new guest and walks away while I wait at the counter.

The lanky figure that walks in wearing a hoodie and jeans is a newer irregular.¬†¬†I wave.¬†

‚ÄúThe usual?‚Äù¬†¬†He squints at me and nods. I tell him the order, ‚Äú1 venti Sugar cookie almond milk latte for Yuri.‚Äù

He smiles and drops the payment. American cash, nice, and walks up to the counter.¬†Sometimes angels pay in weird denominations like Spanish doubloons. It is a real pain. Yuri seems to have a good grasp of manners.

‚ÄúI have been here twice before, and you knew?¬†¬†That is impressive.‚Äù

I smile. I really like Yuri.¬† He, Uriel, is pretty awesome. ‚ÄúIt is one of my things.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúAlso did you know there is a Archdemon in your establishment? She is not bound by any pacts so she can run rampant in here.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes I did. Wait, what?‚Äù¬†

He nods. ‚ÄúPact magic only works on them if you know their true name. Otherwise, they will ignore it and it can‚Äôt touch them. Devils are fallen Angels.¬† As such, they started with rules. Demons are humans that were so wicked in life that their specific urges empowered them after death and they hold power. Kind of like Warlocks or ghosts or you except they had some impressive vices that started things.¬† Which would be almost the opposite of you, I suppose‚Ä¶ Anyway, the only way to keep them in line aside from their true name is by overwhelming them with power.¬† Until they see it, they will push boundaries and not care. Sammy doesn‚Äôt have much control over them because they sort of damned themselves without much of a push‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs tried to‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHold up. So even if I warned her not to touch the staff, she would try it anyway until I basically beat her for trying?‚Äù

He nods. ‚ÄúEspecially an ArchDemon, they are usually ancient and sneaky.‚Äù

My eyes widen.¬†

I look around for her. She isn't anywhere I can see. I look around and can‚Äôt find someone else.

‚ÄúJohn, where is Jackie?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe went into the restroom‚Ä¶..‚Äù

No one was watching. I wouldn‚Äôt care if they were. I am at the restroom door before he can finish the word. I walk in.¬†

¬†

Jackie is mostly dressed and currently backed against a wall. Mommy is licking her neck and I can‚Äôt see where one of her hands is, but judging from the other being inside the front of Jackie‚Äôs shirt, I can guess.¬† Jackie is moaning in pleasure.¬† Jackie is also crying‚Ä¶

My Jackie is crying.¬† She is assaulting my Jackie.¬†

*SHE IS NOT GOING TO ASSAULT MY JACKIE!!!* ¬†¬†

Mommy‚Äôs hair is now in my hand, her neck twisted at a bad angle, we are eye to eye now. Not a good thing when I am half a foot taller than her. ¬†Too bad.¬† I slam the side of her head into the wall. The wall turns out to not be as hard. I keep eye contact with this creature as I start speaking to her, ‚ÄúKeep your hands off her you bitch!‚Äù

Crash. I slam her head into the wall again.

‚ÄúIf you think you can weasel out of following the rules of hospitality, think again.‚Äù

Crash. Again. She changes into her demonic form. Neat!¬† I now have a horn for a hand hold, thanks. I keep talking and smashing.

‚ÄúPart of that is to do nothing to another against their will.‚Äù¬†

Crash.¬† Harder this time.¬† She can take it.

‚ÄúShe is fine with it!‚Äù Her voice is faltering.¬† She is hurting even if she doesn‚Äôt want to show it.¬† *The pain in her voice is like nourishment to me right now. I want more of it.*¬†

Another crash, if she was human she would probably be unconscious by now.¬† But she isn‚Äôt.¬† I don‚Äôt stop.

My voice is full of venom, ‚ÄúAnd if your enchantment wasn‚Äôt fucking with her mind, would she be?‚Äù

Crash.

‚ÄúHOW FUCKING DARE YOU HURT **MY JACKIE**?!??‚Äù¬†

I slam her head into the wall again and again. My rage is causing sparks.¬† I don‚Äôt fucking care. I can hear masonry cracking with every slam of her head into the wall. I don‚Äôt fucking care. I will fix it later.¬†

Crash.

She tries to get away, she can‚Äôt move. Her eyes are terrified. I can guess why.

Crash.

I lean into it. I make myself even scarier by dropping any mask completely and letting her see me in all my power.¬†

Crash.¬†

Wings I didn‚Äôt know I had until this moment open an unfurl.¬† They look like dragonfly wings.¬† Neat.¬† ¬†I have really cool wings!

Crash.

Stop squirming, bitch.¬†

Crash.

‚ÄúThis is MY DOMAIN. You are a bad guest.‚Äù¬†

Crash.

Instantly she is wracked in pain. It must be absolutely excruciating.¬† Considering how her body is convulsing it must be pure agony.¬† She barely registered me smashing her head into the masonry, but this, this she cannot handle.¬†

Good.¬†

I enjoy the show.¬† She also starts fading as I watch. Literally begins losing color as if she is becoming see through as her pain continues.¬† My sneer only widening as she can‚Äôt even vocalize a scream. Her eyes look anywhere for a salvation that isn‚Äôt going to come.¬†There‚Äôs only the three of us.

*No one hurts Jackie.*¬† *Nothing can save you unless it is me, bitch!¬† I have no intention of doing it.¬† SUFFER!*

A hand on my arm pulls me back from the abyss.¬†¬†‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt.‚Äù¬†¬†Jackie‚Äôs eyes plead with me.¬†

I look into those gorgeous blue eyes.¬†

Crash goes Mommy‚Äôs head, just because.¬† Pure spite this time.

‚ÄúShe was about to‚Ä¶‚Äù¬† I look at Jackie's sad eyes and only get angrier.¬† *NO ONE HURTS MY JACKIE.*

Crash. Okay, that one was a little petty‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThis is not for her. This is for you.‚Äù¬† Jackie is afraid for me, and afraid OF me‚Ä¶

I never want to see this woman look at me like that again.¬† I turn to the demon with her nearly caved in skull. ‚ÄúApologize.‚Äù

Mommy‚Äôs expression changes to determination. Through the pain she manages to croak out ‚ÄúSo sorry, red.‚Äù

‚ÄúAccepted.‚Äù¬† Jackie is far too forgiving.¬† But this is what she wants, so‚Ä¶

‚ÄúYou are no longer a bad guest.‚Äù

Mommy‚Äôs pain ceases immediately. Her body finally stops swaying.¬† She falls to the ground gasping for air after I let her horn go.¬† The incubus looks at me and there is a mix of fear, anger, and something. I don‚Äôt know what it is, but I see it.¬† I can see that she is also seems willing to behave now.¬†My glare tells her I would be happy to finish the job.¬† Somewhere nearby I hear crackling like static electricity grounding.

She grabs Jackie‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúI am so very sorry.¬†¬†I was so annoyed at this terrifying one‚Äôs iron will that I took out my frustration on you and let my feelings get in the way of asking and making sure.¬†¬†You being such a gorgeous thing, and attracted to me, with that particular vice, it made me assume things.¬†Assume the go ahead‚Ä¶¬†I am monster, I know that, but I can and should do better here. I should not be taking my annoyance at your lover out on you‚Ä¶‚Äù

Jackie blushes. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call yourself a monster. And do better.¬†¬†Also, I have a boyfriend.‚Äù

She looks at Jackie and then at me.¬†¬†I glare at her.¬†¬† *Fucking what of it, bitch?*

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my boss and my roommate.‚Äù¬† Jackie smiles like it is a joke.¬†

‚ÄúYou two are ***such*** a clich√©.‚Äù¬† Her voice is almost annoyed at us.

I am suddenly done with this demon.¬† She can feel my mood shift as she looks back at me in fear as flames erupt around me again.

I point at the door. ‚ÄúYou.¬†¬†Out.¬†¬†Get your drink. Get out after you do. Banned for 1 week after you leave.¬†¬†If you ever pull this bullshit in my establishment again, you will never step foot in it afterwards, that is, if you even manage to make it out. Which I likely will not be willing to allow.‚Äù

She tilts her head. ‚ÄúDemons aren‚Äôt devils, we aren‚Äôt part of any pact not made with us individually.‚Äù

I smile, showing all my teeth.¬† She and Jackie both gasp. ‚ÄúAnd yet when I called you a bad guest you started dying. Think on that, Mommy, dearest.¬†¬†Unbound or no, I will not care. Do not test me again.¬† You will find my rage and cruelty a match for any other ArchFae.‚Äù

*‚ÄúI am so fucking scaroused right now!‚Äù*¬†¬†I stare at the succubus.¬†I really didn‚Äôt need to hear that from her.¬†I mean, it could be Jackie but it felt too intense. Sometimes I hate not being able to tell who is broadcasting.¬† Such an annoying drawback to this power.¬† One that apparently only I have. Yea, can‚Äôt be Jackie.

I let go of my power and land lightly on my feet.¬† Guess I was floating?¬† Whoops.¬† Fuck, I gotta fix the walls.¬† That is a problem for future Pat.¬† She will call a professional.

I walk out and Yuri is sipping his drink. The moment Mommy comes out Yuri motions to her. She pales at seeing him. She motions to her drink and then the door.

*What a good guest, she listened.¬†¬†¬†I won‚Äôt have to cave her fucking head in*, *harder this time.*

She turns and looks at me in terror. Guess she heard that?

They head outside and have a conversation by the door. At the end he walks back in shaking his head and smiling.¬†

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you topped an incubus. Hell, she‚Äôs one of the top three most powerful demons.‚Äù¬† His mirth annoys me.

I raise an eyebrow. I point to my name-tag. ‚ÄúBoss Bitch‚Äù. He only gets louder with his laughing.¬†

‚ÄúYou know you will see her in almost exactly 1 week now, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúAs long as she follows the rules, she is fine.¬†¬†We just had to establish some groundwork.¬† Strangers are people we haven‚Äôt met.¬† Guests are friends we haven‚Äôt made yet.‚Äù

He shakes his head. ‚ÄúDemons hate rules. Although incubi and succubi are usually more bound by them when it comes to sex.¬†¬†You and Jackie must have really sparked something in her. Oh, the succubi are going to come here in droves.‚Äù

Oh great.¬†¬†Maybe a dress code is needed?

I am musing on how many Fae would get caught in the crossfire when a familiar softness hits my arm. Two softnesses, if I am being honest.¬† Jackie is hugging my arm and looking up at me. Her expression is flirty and full of joy.¬†

‚ÄúMy heroine!‚Äù¬† She is fucking blinking at me like an anime Waifu‚Ä¶

My eyes roll involuntarily.¬† God, I do not need this‚Ä¶

‚ÄúShut up, you would do the same for me.‚Äù¬† I know I am correct.

She laughs. ‚ÄúOnly because I love you!‚Äù She breaks away and goes to help the drive thru. Skipping as she goes.¬† I watch her.¬† Good, she‚Äôs okay.¬† *If that bitch had done any real harm, I would have made her watch me serve her entrails to a redcap.*¬† Jackie turns and talks to John.¬† He nods a bit and smiles.¬† She gives him a thumbs up and proceeds to start with their orders.

‚ÄúPray tell, is there a rule 3 but for dating other staff?‚Äù

I look at Yuri.¬†¬†‚ÄúThere is corporate policy on that.¬† Fellow staff are called Partners. And, no, Partners are fine. Just keep it professional, mostly, at work and don‚Äôt cause problems with drama. Break ups suck but they often lead to okay endings.¬† If they don‚Äôt, I will play with schedules or see about getting someone a job elsewhere.¬† Why would I ban dating a co-worker?‚Äù

He nods. ‚ÄúWhat about the management?‚Äù

I know the answer immediately, ‚ÄúCorporate has rules on supervisors and such.¬† As a shift supervisor Jackie can‚Äôt date anyone on her shift.¬† Managers can‚Äôt date anyone at all, and I am in the manager boat.‚Äù

He nods as if I confirmed something.¬†¬†Then he gets a smile on his face as if he thought of something sinister, which is kinda weird for an angel... ‚ÄúDo you have any applications to fill out?‚Äù

*Oh FUCK ME!!!*

**May 16**

I have gotten pretty used to ridiculously gorgeous Fae hitting on me. It would be endearing if it wasn‚Äôt so dangerous. ‚ÄúYou know, we could have so much fun for a short while. Maybe just a few courts‚Ä¶ I would‚Ä¶‚Äù. I hold my hand up.¬†

‚ÄúA few courts, as in spring to summer?‚Äù

‚ÄúNO!¬†¬†Of course not. Summer to summer. I don‚Äôt rush things!‚Äù

‚ÄúI have lived 26 courts.¬†¬†You would take one-thirteenth my life to have sex with you.‚Äù¬†¬†I am eyeing the nymph and wondering if it would be worth it.¬†But then again, it‚Äôs Meca.¬† So no.

‚ÄúWell, I mean, I could go for longer if you liked‚Ä¶‚Äù she tries the forward lean, showing cleavage and smiling.¬†This nymph has always had game.

I feel the jealousy hit. Apparently someone behind in the room likes Meca.¬†¬†I don‚Äôt bother turning around. It could be any of them.¬†Hell, I feel waves of it coming from the table with Connie, Todd, and a couple of goblins‚Ä¶

‚ÄúRule 3.‚Äù

She pouts and I nearly laugh.¬†

‚ÄúMeca, Dark Roast, Grande.‚Äù¬†¬†Jackie‚Äôs voice is sweet and charming as usual. I can hear the malice. Meca did screw her date at May‚Äôs wedding when we were all bridesmaids like a month ago‚Ä¶

Meca smiles at me and leaves. I understand why men were lost to them in stories. I kinda get Tailor at the wedding now too. I wave.¬†

The next gentleman is wearing a pretty standard business suit. He stares at Meca as she leaves. Looking back at plain old me he almost looks disappointed.¬†¬†‚ÄúNot every day you see a goddess walking around.‚Äù

I smile. ‚ÄúNot a goddess, but yea, I get you. What would you like today, honored guest?‚Äù

He smiles. Looking up he was not checking the menu at all prior to getting here. Pretty sure he was checking her ass the entire time.¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúAmericano, Grande.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill that be all?‚Äù¬†¬†I wait for him to grab a muffin, which he does, and add it to the order.¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúWhat should we call to let you know your drink is ready?‚Äù¬†¬†He laughs.

He looks at me. ‚ÄúLong way to ask for a name.¬†¬†It is Jim.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt ask for names, don‚Äôt want the fair folk getting you.¬†¬†We will call Jim when your drink is ready.‚Äù¬†¬†I wink and he is left wondering if I meant that.¬†

Meca walks up with her drink. ‚ÄúI wonder if Jim would like to spend time with me?‚Äù¬† She winks. ‚ÄúThe rules are rules, you evil nymph. We don‚Äôt want another Tailor situation.¬† Now sit that perfect rear on your usual chair!‚Äù I laugh as I point.

She laughs and nearly dances to the chair. Damn nymphs don‚Äôt do things halfway.¬†

We get through the midday rush and I am exhausted. I am technically done. I still have some bookkeeping to do tonight. Gonna be a long day.¬†

I wave as Lemar and Jacob come to take over. Lemar asks for a report.¬†¬†¬†I look over and see the business suit has not left the table where he is talking to Meca.¬†

‚ÄúMeca the nymph heard Jim‚Äôs first name. I am not sure if she is trying to get his second so she can take out her frustration on him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy would she be frustrated?‚Äù

‚ÄúRule 3.‚Äù

He laughs. ‚ÄúWho was she hitting on today?‚Äù

‚ÄúMe.¬†¬†She has no standards.‚Äù

I feel multiple blows of rage. All of them are angry with me.¬†¬†Huh?

‚ÄúWhat?¬†¬†It would be different if it was you, Jacob, or Jackie, or any of you really. You are all way more attractive than meeeee STOP PINCHING ME!‚Äù My manager just pinched me!

Jackie glares at me.¬†

‚ÄúYou, say three nice things about yourself. Now!‚Äù

I can‚Äôt believe she invoked our self-deprecation rule on me, again‚Ä¶ ugh.

‚ÄúI am a good boss, I have a strong will, and I don‚Äôt have a big ego.‚Äù

Lemar‚Äôs turn to glare.¬†¬†He surprises me. ‚ÄúEverything you said was an understatement of epic proportions.¬†¬†You are the BEST boss, and the rest are just so weak compared to reality they are hilarious.‚Äù

Grace, pipes in. ‚ÄúYou have, like, no ego, dear. That nymph has high standards. She will string him along some and then leave. She pursues the pretty ones.¬†¬†I barely show up on her radar and you are her preoccupation.

Grace is a 40-something stunner. If I looked that good at her age, I would be overjoyed.¬†¬†Hell, if I looked that good now I would be.¬† What the hell?¬† ‚ÄúBut you are a total um‚Ä¶ ‚Äú

Grace looks at me.¬† Jackie just goes ahead and says what I am thinking.¬† ‚ÄúYou are a total MILF, Grace.¬† Any 18+ year old with a libido thinks so.¬† You have a milkshake that brings all the boys to mmmmmmmmmph‚Äù¬† And my hand just covered up her mouth before we get a lawsuit.

‚ÄúMMMMaph.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes Jackie?‚Äù  
‚Äúmmmmammmph mmm mmmmmmoooooooooommm‚Äù

Hand‚Ä¶ommm‚Ä¶ mooom?

Oh, hand on boob.¬†

HAND ON HER BOOB!

I move away and she laughs.¬† ‚ÄúYou are such a dork, Pat.¬† Next time ask permission. Also, Remember Tailor?¬† Meca confessed she only did it to try and get a threesome with me.¬† ,She was hoping you would join instead when you found them. I am not her first pick, you are.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe?¬† But‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was one of the first 10 irregulars in the shop.¬† She has been eye fucking you since before I became your roommate‚Ä¶‚Äù

Grace pipes up.¬† ‚ÄúShe tells us about some of the things she fantasizes about when the night shift is slow.¬† You are featured in, like three quarters of them.‚Äù

Lemar laughs.¬† ‚ÄúShe asked May how to get on the exception list so she could maybe date you.‚Äù

I am absolutely not able to process this. Especially since my brain is still remembering the feel on my hand‚Ä¶ so soft. So warm‚Ä¶

Jackie shakes her head.¬† ‚ÄúMaybe Tungsten isn‚Äôt dense enough?‚Äù¬† They all nod.

¬†

My shift ends shortly after this exchange.

¬†

Lemar motions me to leave. I love my manager. He shoos the owner out the door. Fearless. I grab my umbrella as it might rain today and head out. As I get to the door the rain starts. I pop open my umbrella and get accosted.¬†

Jackie grabs my arm and saddles up to me. My arm is nestled between her boobs. Soft. I stare down at her. ‚ÄúForget your umbrella?‚Äù

She is smiling as she nods. ‚ÄúYep.¬†¬†Since we are going to the same place, it makes sense not to get wet.‚Äù

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt Mark get jealous?‚Äù¬† I am mainly glad he didn‚Äôt see the boob grab earlier.

‚ÄúAbout that, we need a confab. Let‚Äôs walk and talk.‚Äù

We get to the bus stop and Jackie looks up. She‚Äôs been riding my arm and snuggling up because of the temperature drop and her lack of planning.¬†

*Oh boy. How do I say this?¬†¬†‚ÄúPat has a shit picker. She shouldn‚Äôt have pushed Mark on you. Hell, the only person she has ever loved that is great, let alone good is Ricardo.¬† Oh and you.‚Äù¬† Wait‚Ä¶*

‚ÄúHe is passionate and driven.‚Äù

She stares at me. She literally says ‚Äústaaaaaaaaaaaare‚Äù and waits.¬† Must get that from her mom‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI think he may be a bit too jealous sometimes. I don‚Äôt like it. And it gives me a bad feeling.‚Äù¬† *You deserve so much better than him, someone that lets you be yourself, bi-polyam and fucking awesome. Someone better than him‚Ä¶ or me.*

‚ÄúOkay.¬†¬†Thanks, babe.‚Äù

I chuckle, ‚ÄúAnytime, darling.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the first time you have called me that. Makes me happy.‚Äù She smiles at me.¬†

‚ÄúWell, red, you are usually doing something that earns you a different moniker in that moment. You are asking how I feel because he has been in our home a few times. Being an absolute darling to me. So, yea, darling.‚Äù

The bus arrives as I say this and she laughs as we get on. ‚ÄúRemember that whole thing with Meca ?¬†¬†You just confirmed something for me. You are denser than tungsten.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt get her sometimes.¬†

1lrhyps,https://v.redd.it/bqr8ylggtuaf1,Breaking the touch barrier.,"In the above clip, notice how the woman, while bantering about their encounter many years back, lays her hand on his for 2 seconds (on the desk).

That form of touch was not just a friendly touch. It was a touch of affection‚Äîa touch that communicates, ""I like you.""

The context is: she is confessing that she liked him many years back when they were young and is replaying her visit to his apartment through a common friend.

We are talking about breaking the touch barrier.

But not just breaking the touch barrier‚Äîwe also want to break the touch barrier that has an element of polarity.

Not every touch has the same flavour and character.

Some suggest playing the thumb fight game or doing hand reading as a way to break the touch barrier.

The problem with that is the flavour and character of the touch. It's a non-polarized touch.

The key point while breaking the touch barrier is to communicate or create an atmosphere of polarity.
(We are talking here about breaking the touch barrier in the context of attraction dynamics.)

So let me give some examples you can use to break the touch barrier without compromising the polarity and avoiding the creepy route:


1. Touching her hair ‚Äì Should be done a little later on a date or after having some social chemistry.

Say or ask something about her hair (nothing negative). And while you do that, put your hand out to reach for her hair. Watch if she tilts her head towards your hand or slightly moves forward, inviting you to touch her hair‚Äîthen go ahead and touch her hair. If she moves backward even slightly or stays neutral, pull your hand back.

Another version of touching the hair can be done by moving the strands of her hair from her face. The same principle applies as the above one. Just put your hand out there while saying something like, ""I can't see your eyes."" If she pulls back even slightly or does it by herself, take your hand back and continue talking.


2. Keeping your palms on her hand ‚Äì It can be done anytime after she has warmly received you.

I do this all the time. A few days back, I was in Dubai Mall looking for a particular restaurant. I happened to see a woman walking. I watched her attentively to get a sense of her and how I felt about her. I just went ahead and approached her. Within 30 seconds, my hands were on her arm‚Äînot grabbing or holding her arms‚Äîjust a slight rest on her arms for 4 seconds maybe, while we continued to talk. Yes, she received me quite warmly in the first 10 seconds itself.

Even on a date, you can subtly touch like the one you saw in the clip. It is better you do this while there is an ongoing playful moment.


3. Brushing ‚Äì This is like a slight touch that lingers on her for more than 2 seconds. However, the touch is not stuck at one place; it's moving.

I remember one particular scene from the movie Unfaithful. The woman, who happens to end up in some stranger's house, is offered by the stranger to remove her outer coat. In the process of removing her coat, he uses his finger to slightly brush through the back of her neck. Very subtle. Watch it.
(I can't upload the clip here because of the limitation of one clip only.)

You can do this by brushing her shoulders while walking or while standing at the counter to check some bakes.

Other ways to do this are while exchanging some objects like coffee cups, cell phones, etc. You can overlay your fingers on hers while either of you are exchanging the said objects. Remember just to brush‚Äînot hold on to it.


4. Other smarter ways include playing the game of pool together and helping her while playing, reading a book for the blind together (you have to use your fingers to read it), or any physical activity you are good at but she needs to learn. Sharing a dance floor is also a good way to break the touch barrier. But you must make sure the dance is intimate with slow music.


What about touching the small of her back?

Yes. This is great and quite intimate. Do this only if there is mild chemistry. You can do this while you both are standing side by side, overlooking a view (a balcony of the bar), or leading her somewhere.


Then there are some advanced and strong ways to break the touch barrier. But doing them without calibration and at the right time can overwhelm a woman. Hence, I am not going to add them here.

The most important point is your internal frame.

A good internal frame is: ""I genuinely desire her. I want to express that to her.""

A weak internal frame is: ""I want to escalate because I need to escalate to make something happen,"" or ""I have to break the touch barrier because that's how I should be as a man.""

I hope this helps. If you have some more ideas or comments to elevate this discussion, please add your comments.

Their 'pushing' their product isn't 'You need this because this is what it can do for you', it's 'You need this because your life is terrible, and others are better than you for using it'. 

I understand, they want to show that they can improve the lives of people using the app, but Its not very good advertising to downplay your potential customers, considering there are loads of other (better) scheduling apps. AI doesn't make everything the greatest there ever was lmfao. Atrocious ad campaign

  
As of October last year, it was addressed by the CEO of the company. However they seemed to have doubled down, looking at how condescending their recent adverts are. I mean one of those ads is legitimately the dude just saying: 

""You're doing <X thing > so you're awful, and behind on everything, while they're doing <X thing, but with Motion and AI automation> So they're so much better than/ahead of you, even before the morning coffee"" or something close to that, as they proceed to tell me nothing about the app itself that is worth investing into. 

You can't just assume I'm at the bottom tier of productivity because I don't use one of the million generic AI productivity apps that are being pushed to me. 

It's corny, and very annoying after some time of seeing it, especially when you cant skip some of them, and looking at the reviews too, It doesn't seem to be all that. Granted it's great at managing workload and organising, but it misses a lot of key features that would properly warrant an ad campaign like that.

I wrote back:

Morning my C üòä
Have you started the conversation? Have you said to your wife that you want to separate?


His response:

Hello my P üòä
I will keep it brief.
I have started the conversation. I did not start it by saying I want to separate - as I have said, I need to do things my way. It hasn‚Äôt been easy or pleasant.
I understand why you have written your message like this... It just doesn‚Äôt read like a message that came from you.
I will reach out when I am free.


The background:
We were both married when we first met and we had an instant connection from our very  first messages. He wrote proper sentences, was polite and genuinely wanted to get to know me. I broke two of my rules and met up with him the next day (normally wait at least a week to see if I‚Äôm wasting my time) and for a drink (normally just meet for a coffee). I was super nervous but he put me at ease instantly. 

Two days after we met, my now ex husband wanted out. It was probably a long time coming, hence why I went looking for an AP. It was a long stretched out separation and given the connection I had with my AP, I was happy to let it continue even though I was now a single woman. My AP doesn‚Äôt have a lot of restrictions so we could see each other a few times a week. There were also trips away several times a year, good morning and good night messages every single day, messaging every day all throughout the day and a phone call most days. We were both each other‚Äôs first sexual partners outside of our long term spouses and began a journey of sexual discovery that we had never experienced before. We fell in love relatively quickly and very deeply, and we grew together.

He was always aware I was a single woman who deserved to be loved openly and I was always aware he is a married man who was never going to leave his wife. I had compartmentalised it and realised that he treats me a lot better than a lot of single men would and he made a lot of time for me. I stopped expecting a future together and lived for the moment. Years passed, our kids were getting older and I could no longer ignore that life was passing me by whilst I continue being in the shadows. Everyone thought I was single, when actually I had met the love of my life and my soulmate and I just wanted to shout it from the rooftop. About 9 months ago, after almost 5 years together, I said I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. I never wanted to make him choose between his wife/family and me, I always wanted it to be a decision he made because he no longer wanted to be married to his wife. He couldn‚Äôt make that decision because he didn‚Äôt want to break up the family. So I left.

I was so broken and so was he. We couldn‚Äôt stand to be apart but I couldn‚Äôt go back to the way things were. He said our time apart made him realise his future was with me so he was going to end his marriage. There were some major milestones in his family‚Äôs life so I gave him the time to deal with all of that. We fell back into the same patterns but I saw him make some moves towards that future with me so I kept holding on to hope.

About 2 weeks ago, I just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. He still hadn‚Äôt said anything to his wife yet and at that point I realised he is never going to say anything to end his marriage because he‚Äôs got it too good. He sees me several times a week and we have an amazing time, but then he gets to go home and play happy house with his wife and his kids. As long as I am allowing it, he will never leave. So I ended it once again. 

He was crushed and he said he will say something now, but it needs to be his way and his timeline and we realised we had to stop seeing each other for him to have the space to have the conversation with his wife. He wasn‚Äôt going to tell her about me, just that he wanted out. She had previously had an emotional affair that lasted years which was the catalyst for him to go looking for his own affair.

Anyway, he kept messaging me after we agreed to have a break until he spoke to his wife. I was glad to hear from him, but it would also grate on me that he still hasn‚Äôt said anything yet so I would hold back and give somewhat unemotional replies, mostly to protect myself. 

He sent that first message above. Then I cracked and thought why are we still having these messages when he hasn‚Äôt even started the conversation with his wife. So I wrote my short reply.

Then he wrote his last reply. I am so devastated üò≠ He has never taken that tone with me before, nor ever been that cold.

I was discussing what ground rules we have for a first date with my girlfriends and I'm wondering if I'm being too...for the lack of a better word, harsh with my rules. 

1. I always insist on splitting the bills on most dates, especially the first few ones i go on with a person, even if they offer to pay because I feel that somehow letting them pay my part gives them a sort of higher ground to expect something out of me. I'd rather keep the playing ground level. 

2. I do not kiiss someone on my first date with them- I could've known them as a friend forever, but this is the first time im getting to know them romantically. I take some time to open up and you know, make out or hook up with someone. I have no reasoning for this other than the fact that it just doesn't feel great to me. I absolutely do not judge others who feel comfortable doing this. 

3. I like to have my first dates at a coffee shop- low stakes, and if the date goes south, there is always enough people around me to ensure I don't get caught in a potentially dangerous situation. 

My friends understand my rules, but also tell me that I deserve to chill out and not be so paranoid. I have a date coming up tommorow, and I'm wondering if I just let loose this time. ",49,1751632741.0,TwoXIndia,11,0.94,False

She told me I didn't get prettier losing that much weight, and if I were sick she would believe me, except you still have color in your face"". ""But maybe some women like that..."" and walks away.

Let just say these co-workers are used to see me a bit bigger... For a brief moment it made me feel insecure. I think it's very rude! Had to tell myself multiple times I was doing this for myself!

Is this some form of hate or jealousy? Are people genuinely concerned with comments like don't get leaner? I got asked twice if I was using drugs for the weight loss.",9,1751632476.0,loseit,9,0.77,False

I‚Äôm hoping you all might have some ideas or insights. My partner and I are both working remotely and trying to figure out where to live next/settle down.

I made another post here recently where I was comparing Denver, Minneapolis, and the PNW, but after thinking more about what really matters to us, I‚Äôm realizing I don‚Äôt want to limit it to just those options. I‚Äôd love to hear a wider range of perspectives and recommendations.

Some background:

* We currently live near Denver. While there‚Äôs so much to do here, I‚Äôve realized I crave easier access to nature, ideally forests, trees, water, without always having to plan an entire hike or drive an hour. I‚Äôm kind of sick of overcrowded trails and needing to plan so much - I am more of a lazy outdoors person lol. 
* My family is in Des Moines, Iowa. It‚Äôs very affordable and near family, but it doesn‚Äôt excite me or tick most of my boxes. Part of me wonders if I *should* live near family (especially as we think about starting our own), or if it‚Äôs okay to be farther away and just plan to visit several times a year.
* We‚Äôre hoping to start a family eventually. I had a miscarriage earlier this year, and while we still want children, I‚Äôm trying to be realistic that it may or may not happen. It‚Äôs hard to know how much that should shape our decision when I really have no clue if it will ever happen.
* HCOL is definitely a concern, we don‚Äôt have unlimited income, but we also know you can‚Äôt have everything without tradeoffs.

**What we‚Äôre looking for in a place to live:**

* Easy, everyday access to nature: greenery, trees, water if possible
* A place that feels safe-ish (I know nowhere is perfect)
* Ideally some wildlife around (I love animals), but that‚Äôs not a dealbreaker
* A community with some charm or beauty, not just big box stores and endless sprawl
* My boyfriend is a sucker for a cute downtown area with coffee shops for him to work at
* Somewhere that won‚Äôt totally destroy us financially

I‚Äôm not set on any specific region this time. Instead of narrowing it down to a shortlist, I‚Äôd love to hear:

**Where do you live that you truly love?**  
What town or area do you think might fit this kind of lifestyle?

Any ideas, personal experiences, or reality checks are very welcome. Thanks so much for reading and helping me think this through.",0,1751632386.0,SameGrassButGreener,10,0.5,False

Our kitchen is a smaller galley kitchen with old cabinets that were painted by previous owners about 10-15 years ago.

The picture above (1&2) were from when we bought the home.

Pictures 3&4 are AI renders with the orange wall painted Swiss Coffee.

The cabinet doors are an olive green type color and the cabinet frames have an off-white color that is faded and dirty.

We were thinking of putting in some elbow grease to do some free upgrades to the kitchen and one of those upgrades we are thinking of is painting the cabinets.

I'm not sure if we should paint the doors and upper cabinets one color (whitish) and keep the bottom doors and paint the bottom cabinets to match?

The floor is a vinyl floor and counter top are beige colored.

Does anybody have ideas on what colors we should do, if any?

The stove and fridge are stainless.

But when he falls for her serene sister, Lottie, Madilyn‚Äôs world shatters. She walks away, focusing on her career with her loyal team. Just as her new venture thrives, Stanley‚Äôs company crumbles, and he returns, begging for a second chance. Meanwhile, Brycen Elliott, her childhood friend and former fianc√©, reenters her life, offering support and reigniting old bonds...

# Chapter 1 - ""From Ashes to Rivalry""

Stanley Griffin, my fianc√©, fell in love with my sister, claiming she was gentle and serene, unlike my fiery and headstrong nature.

I laughed. He seemed to forget that it was precisely my fiery and headstrong personality that helped him rise from the ashes and manage a corporation of thousands.

At a gathering, he got drunk and confided in his friends, ""I want to follow my heart and pursue what I truly love, not settle for a lifetime with Madilyn Lawrence.""

Later, I let him go, allowing him to chase his true love.

Meanwhile, I started over with my trusted team, pouring my heart into my career.

He seemed to regret it. Seeing his company in shambles and his once-beloved now just a shadow of her former self, he begged me for another chance.

==============================

Stanley Griffin came to my office while I was in a meeting.

My team tactfully left the room.

I smirked,

""What, didn‚Äôt you go after your true love?""

He opened his mouth but ultimately said nothing.

""Madilyn, I was drunk that night, you‚Ä¶""

I cut him off impatiently, ""What you do is none of my concern.""

I had been devoted to Stanley for seven years, making his company my priority, his moods my compass.

Yet, I still ended up being his second choice.

Watching him struggle to retort but hold back gave me immense satisfaction.

A month ago, it was Lottie Russell who mocked me in front of him:

""Sister, how could you not even keep your own fianc√©?""

At that time, Stanley gently held her, as if she were the most precious treasure in the world, and whispered softly,

""How could she ever compare to you?""

==============================

For seven years, Stanley had been hot and cold with me.

Even though I stuck to him like glue, he remained indifferent.

I would wait at home with dinner ready, sometimes until two or three in the morning.

He would come home reeking of alcohol, his breath tinged with the faint smell of tobacco.

His rough kisses would land on my ear, collarbone, and further down‚Ä¶

I closed my eyes, my lashes fluttering, feeling his presence.

Only in those moments would he come close to me.

The next morning, the other side of the bed would be cold, as if he had never been there.

I laughed at myself. Back then, I was so naive to think that my companionship could warm his heart.

While I was foolishly waiting,

He was living out the dream I could never attain with Lottie.

I was such a fool, silent and blind.

==============================

Now, the only thing I feel grateful for is that,

During those seven years, I helped him manage the company, negotiating with different clients every day, exhausting myself.

Lottie took advantage of this gap to develop a relationship with Stanley, engaging in their clandestine affair.

Little did I know that those years of being his loyal servant would give me a chance to start over.

I have the resources, connections, and business acumen. What do you have to hold me back?

==============================

Just as my company was thriving, disaster struck.

Aside from a few initial media reports about Stanley, his scandalous affair, which should have rocked the city, barely made a ripple.

Such a big story going unreported? It was obvious Richard Griffin had a hand in it.

Expected, after all, the elite care about their image.

What I didn‚Äôt expect was the Griffins turning the tables, buying trending hashtags.

Now, everyone in G City knows that the Griffin heir‚Äôs fianc√©e led a scandalous life, trying to marry into wealth and being rejected.

Years of hard work gone to waste, and the younger man I was rumored to be involved with left too.

I laughed in anger.

Many business partners terminated their contracts with my company due to the rumors.

In the blink of an eye, the company‚Äôs situation took a nosedive, teetering on the brink.

That‚Äôs when Brycen Elliott returned.

==============================

The Elliotts and the Lawrences were close family friends. Brycen was originally my fianc√©, but I was so infatuated with Stanley that I gently rejected his feelings.

Unable to change my mind, he chose to stay out of sight, spending the last few years abroad.

He had heard about my situation and rushed back from the U.S.

Bringing with him the connections and resources he had accumulated over the years.

Brycen and I had grown up together, and ourÈªòÂ•ë was such that we didn‚Äôt even need to speak to understand each other. I trusted him completely.

With his help, the company‚Äôs situation improved significantly.

I began to expand new business sectors based on my experience from working at Stanley‚Äôs company,

Slowly forming a rivalry with Stanley‚Äôs business.

The war between Stanley and me had just begun when the unscrupulous media started stirring up trouble again,

With headlines like ""Long-time lover steps in to lend a hand"" and ""Stanley and his lover as close as brothers, betrayed by deceit.""

I rolled my eyes, turning to Brycen, who was organizing files behind me, and bowed slightly.

""Sorry, sorry. Bear with it for a while, and I‚Äôll clear your name.""

He smiled, his gaze locking onto mine.

""No big deal.""

# Chapter 2 - ""Unexpected Encounters and Shattered Illusions""

I thought Stanley and I would never cross paths again, at most, we‚Äôd be rivals in business.

But in the midst of a fierce corporate battle, he abruptly sold his company.

I heard Richard Griffin was furious and threatened to disown him.

Lottie, being shrewd, saw that Stanley‚Äôs fortunes were dwindling and distanced herself early on.

I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder what had possessed him to do something so reckless.

Soon, I found out.

That evening, as I returned home, he cornered me in the narrow space by the door.

The familiar faint scent of tobacco enveloped me.

‚ÄúMadilyn, I‚Äôve missed you.‚Äù

He silently wrapped his arms around me from behind, his touch unexpectedly gentle.

He carried a faint whiff of alcohol, and I found myself wondering what he had been drinking today‚Äîit seemed different from before.

Suddenly, alarm bells rang in my head, and I forcefully broke free from his embrace. The dim light cast fragmented shadows in his eyes, and he raised an eyebrow slightly, his voice tinged with confusion.

‚ÄúMadilyn?‚Äù

I wiped the corner of my eye, a wave of inexplicable disgust rising within me. I took a deep breath, trying to steady my emotions.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing here? This is my home.‚Äù

I stared directly at his slightly haggard face, a mix of complex emotions swirling inside me.

‚ÄúMadilyn, I was wrong this time. I promise I won‚Äôt get involved with any other women again.‚Äù

I looked at him coldly, saying nothing.

He seemed startled by the icy look in my eyes, his hand awkwardly suspended in the air.

‚ÄúMadilyn, enough of this. Don‚Äôt make a scene,‚Äù he said softly, reaching out to pull me closer.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs making a scene?‚Äù

‚ÄúCut me some slack. Everyone makes mistakes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen I don‚Äôt like you anymore, don‚Äôt come bothering me. Who do you think you are?‚Äù

I took a few steps back, looking at him with mockery.

I finally realized how naive I had been, thinking that pretending not to know would keep him mine forever.

Thinking that forgiving him time and time again would move him.

Love can‚Äôt be earned through pity.

In the darkness, he was silent for a long moment.

‚ÄúWhat do you want from me?‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow dramatically, glancing at him sideways.

‚ÄúWhat do I want? I want you to get lost.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt disturb me and Brycen.‚Äù

The next morning, I woke up at noon.

After spewing those harsh words last night, I slammed the door and left Stanley outside, going to sleep on my own.

Rubbing my temples, I realized I hadn‚Äôt slept well at all.

In my dreams, scenes overlapped, and I repeatedly witnessed Stanley at dinners, in bars, flirting with different women.

Ugh, what a nightmare.

He‚Äôs the kind of guy who‚Äôs used to being the center of attention, treating love like a charitable handout.

He seems to have forgotten that he thought others‚Äô admiration was based on what they could gain from him.

Once, someone loved his temper, his vulnerability, but he saw it as a loss of face.

True, pure love‚Äîhe thought it was cheap.

Opening my work phone, 99+ messages flooded in.

My head was spinning.

Brycen‚Äôs call came through at that moment.

‚ÄúMadilyn, where are you?‚Äù

Rubbing my temples, I sighed.

‚ÄúAt home. What‚Äôs up?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a negotiation this afternoon with the VP of M Bank. I think you should meet them.‚Äù

The sunlight filtered through the thin clouds, casting a warm glow over the bustling city streets.

When I arrived at the office, Brycen was already waiting for me downstairs.

Today, he wore a dark casual suit paired with a crisp white shirt, the collar slightly open, exuding a relaxed yet elegant vibe.

His tie was a solid color, complementing the suit and shirt, neither too flashy nor too plain. His dark straight-leg pants were perfectly tailored, neither too tight nor too loose.

On his feet were black leather shoes, smooth and unadorned, yet exuding a subtle luxury.

Nothing like Stanley‚Äôs flashy peacock style.

Tsk tsk, those long legs, that broad shoulders and narrow waist‚Äîwhat a sight.

As I approached, he seemed to sense my presence and looked up, handing me an Americano. A faint cedar scent wafted from his sleeves, his signature cologne.

‚ÄúMadilyn.‚Äù

I took the coffee.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk inside.‚Äù

# Chapter 3 - ""Ravioli, Rivalries, and Reminiscence""

The discussion lasted the entire afternoon, and by the time all the details were finalized, the city lights had already illuminated the night outside.

""Madilyn, let's go grab some of Alfredo‚Äôs ravioli,"" Brycen said as he gently draped a coat over my shoulders from behind.

I remember when I was a kid, I‚Äôd knock on Brycen‚Äôs door whenever I got hungry at night, and he‚Äôd take me to a small alley not far from home for ravioli. The pasta was thin, the filling generous, and they were always piping hot. We‚Äôd both eat until we were sweating, and Brycen would fan me while holding a chilled soda to my lips.

Since we went there so often, Alfredo got to know us and would often sneak a few shrimp-filled ravioli into our bowl of pork ones.

As those memories surfaced, I couldn‚Äôt help but smile softly. Those were the best days of our lives.

""Alright, let‚Äôs bring something for Alfredo too,"" I said.

He smirked. ""Sure.""

He took me to a nearby supermarket. I had intended to buy some health supplements for Alfredo, but in the fresh produce section, I spotted a familiar figure‚ÄîStanley Griffin.

He saw me too, and Brycen, who was pushing the cart beside me.

========================================

What followed was a scene straight out of a dramatic soap opera.

His eyes first lit up like a shooting star streaking across a dark sky, a brief flash of brilliance in the deep blackness. Then, just as quickly, the star plummeted to the ground, stirring up a whirlwind of dust, igniting a fiery blaze.

Stanley strode over to me in three quick steps, bringing a gust of wind with him.

He first lifted his chin, giving Brycen a cool, appraising glance, his posture immediately turning defensive. Then he turned to me, his voice tinged with a hint of grievance.

""Madilyn, didn‚Äôt you always say you wanted to try my cooking? I thought you‚Äôd be coming home soon, so I came out to buy some ingredients to make you dinner.""

Before I could respond, Brycen turned his head and spoke calmly, ""Madilyn, I know you‚Äôre compassionate, but you shouldn‚Äôt just bring any stray home. You never know what hidden motives they might have.""

""Yeah, trying to lay a hand on someone else‚Äôs fianc√©e. People might start thinking you have some kind of weird obsession.""

""Madilyn doesn‚Äôt like to make a fuss, but don‚Äôt think for a second that you‚Äôre worthy of her.""

""Since when did our business become your concern, outsider?""

""Who‚Äôs the outsider here, Stanley?""

I listened to their thinly veiled barbs, feeling like I was caught in the middle of a childish spat. Rubbing my temples, I finally interjected, ""Alright, we‚Äôve got what we need. Let‚Äôs go?""

""Let‚Äôs go.""

""Let‚Äôs go.""

Both voices rang out simultaneously, one clear and cool, the other deep and resonant, but both equally dangerous.

It was clear that this wasn‚Äôt going to end easily.

""You‚Ä¶"" I turned to Stanley, forcing myself to meet his gaze. ""Don‚Äôt come bothering me again.""

I didn‚Äôt understand. He was the one who had cheated, so why did his eyes still hold such clarity?

I mentally scoffed. Capitalists will always be capitalists, putting on a facade with such confidence, as if it were real.

========================================

It was getting late, and Alfredo was about to close up shop when he saw us and welcomed us in with a warm smile.

Alfredo‚Äôs hair had grown whiter, his back more hunched, and he was always coughing now.

Time silently slipped by, and certain moments served as reminders that some things were gone forever.

The ravioli still tasted the same as I remembered, but now we were all grown up.

At the next table sat a father and son. The father was feeding his son bite by bite. At his feet was a burlap sack. When he noticed me looking their way, he gave a simple smile and opened the sack slightly, pulling out two bright orange tangerines.

""Here, miss, try these. They‚Äôre from our own garden.""

I took them and thanked him. They were sweet.

After we finished eating, Brycen drove me home.

As we said goodbye, he gave me a gentle hug.

""Madilyn, if you need anything, call me.""

His embrace was warm and comforting. I took a deep breath. ""Alright.""

Everything was getting better, after all.

Even if I had a bit of grass growing on my head, I‚Äôd plant flowers in it.

I was a modern, independent woman. Love couldn‚Äôt tie me down.

But then, almost immediately, I saw Stanley crouched by my doorstep, a bunch of green vegetables and bags of red and white meat beside him.

Hearing the sound, he quickly looked up.

Just like he was at home.

His eyes were still a bit moist. Yeah, even more like it.

I couldn‚Äôt keep smiling.

# Chapter 4 - ""Shadows of the Past""

""Can you scoot over a bit? Yeah, that‚Äôs better.""He stood up, and suddenly I was engulfed in his shadow. As I typed in the passcode, I casually glanced at him......

My Google drive was full, and since I (unfortunately) need my gmail for work, I went in and decided to clear up space. Started with deleting junk photos that Google decided needed to be backed up for whatever reason. Fast forward to 24 hours later, and the photos are back where I removed them, and they're asking me to pay for storage again. This time I go and delete a TON of pictures from the Google photos app, and they delete from my device. Fortunately, I'm able to restore them from the trash.

So I go into my drive, and had to hunt around for a hidden option to delete and stop backup without deleting files from your device. This reminds me of how Meta always hides and then moves the option to delete or deactivate your account. And then I'm greeted with an intentionally unreadable screen of black text against an almost black background. I had to turn my brightness up all the way in order to read this, which was obviously meant to make me think the app was having issues and close it and/or give up.

Anyway, I get past that hurdle, and the next step is the slowest deletion process I've ever seen. I turn my screen off and go about the rest of my day, letting them delete in the background. Nope, that doesn't work. I wake up this morning to another notification about my drive being full, and being begged for my money. I open back up the app that I left open all night, and find that it had started over. Whatever, that's annoying, I think. I go make some coffee and start getting ready for work, and check again, and it turns out that the pictures will only delete if the app is open, not minimized, and the screen is on. Silly me, thinking one of the biggest tech companies on the planet would make an app that comes standard on all android devices would behave like idk... ANY OTHER APP and be able to accomplish a simple task in the background.

As of right now, my drive is clear, like what I wanted. But I've already started getting pesky emails and notifications about how my photos aren't backed up. I'll update this post whenever google pulls some more bullshit, because it seems inevitable at this point.

For over a year, I have been training in web development as part of my professional journey. As a theme park enthusiast since I was little, I thought: why not combine passion and work for this project?  
The result is [ExploreThemeParks.com](http://ExploreThemeParks.com), with passion, perseverance‚Ä¶ and lots and lots and lots of coffee!

ExploreThemeParks is a community web application where fans can rate rides, leave reviews, create their top 10, explore rankings, and much more.

Today, I really need feedback from true park enthusiasts, hence my post in this group.

What I want to know is: is the site easy to use?  
What features are missing or could be improved?

The goal is to build something useful and fun, by and for us fans. All feedback is welcome!

And the cherry on top, to celebrate the site launch, there‚Äôs a little contest with a ticket to the park of your choice to win :)

Video explaining the full concept: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyGxjTvzrm8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyGxjTvzrm8)  
And the site, of course: [https://explorethemeparks.com/](https://explorethemeparks.com/)

Looking forward to reading your feedback :)",2,1751631439.0,Themepark,2,1.0,False

1lrhaoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1lrhaoq/help_for_residence_permit_extension_termin_no/,Help for Residence Permit Extension Termin ‚Äì No Fluent German Speaker Yet (Based in F√ºrth),"Hi everyone,
My husband and I have a Termin for our residence permit extension coming up in F√ºrth (near Nuremberg). The letter says we need to bring someone who speaks fluent German, but both of us are still learning at A2 level, and unfortunately, we don‚Äôt have any German-speaking friends here yet as we‚Äôre quite new to the city.

We‚Äôre a bit anxious about how to handle the appointment.
We were wondering:
	‚Ä¢	What do people normally do in this situation?
	‚Ä¢	Is it okay to go without a fluent speaker?
	‚Ä¢	Or is there someone (maybe from here) who could kindly accompany us?
We‚Äôre happy to offer a small payment or coffee/lunch in return for the support.

Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated!",0,1751631378.0,germany,2,0.25,False
