The thing is though, we seem to have fallen into taking each other for granted, feeling too comfortable, lack of effort has now pushed way to feeling a little invisible, plus we have older kids who will probably fly the nest within a few years, and so im unsure how we'll navigate just being a couple.  
*I'm not here to moan, or vent, promise!*

I go to work, i go through all the formalities talking with work colleagues who i have no real intention of becoming friends with, i have lunch on my own because i really cant stand how some people moan about the same thing day after day. I go home then normally i will prep and cook dinner, i cook 90% of the time, and i enjoy it, i find it therapeutic, i might then sort the washing out if there's a load in the machine, tidy up a little, shower then relax in front of the TV. 
*Wow, how boring does that sound?!*

Some things that i like..  
*Lazy mornings, people watching, the warm sun on my skin, fresh coffee, the smell of freshly cut grass, rum (spiced or dark), teasing, exploring castles and forests (not hiking), long drives in the countryside, 90's alternative music, cooking and trying new foods, horror/psychological films, late nights and early lazy mornings, drawing/sketching, dogs.*

A few things i dont like..  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

I have a Baratza Encore ESP grinder and Gaggia Classic Pro (not evo line) machine setup for my espresso and recently I've had some issues, particularly with my grinder.

I've written this as a timeline of things I've tried bringing me around to the present day, so you know what I've already tried

For a while I had to grind at some of the lowest grind settings on my Encore (I'm talking like settings 1-3), and those settings were VERY fickle. My standard is a 21g in, 42g out (since my portafilter was built for 21g) and typically that works within 30 seconds.

However, recently:

* If I set it on grind setting 3 or higher, it would come out in less than 20 seconds (way too fast) and taste sour
* If I set it on grind setting 2, it would sometimes come out in around 30 seconds (and taste right) but still sometimes go too fast
* If I set it on grind setting 1, it would always come out far too slow (it would take 60+ seconds to pull 42g output)

What this indicated to me is that I needed to troubleshoot, so I did. I realized my burr holder plastic ring was cracked so I replaced that - the issue persisted. So, I then shimmed my grinder with a single washer shim, to ""raise"" the fineness reference window and hopefully allow me more give and take. I also fully cleaned out my grinder both times. For people unfamiliar with shimming, adding a single shim is ideally supposed to move the grind level ""up"" by 4-5 clicks, so if you ground on a 3 before you'd now (post shimming) grind on a 7 or 8 (ideally). 

Now that it's shimmed though, it's become EXTREMELY fine - anything below a grind level 19-20 is \*so\* fine that the espresso machine physically cannot put any water through it, but then when I grind on level 20 the shot suddenly whips around and comes streaming out, pulling in 10 or less seconds.

I hope I've made clear what my issue is: I'm not experienced enough with coffee to know by sight what coarse or fine means for grind size, but in the feedback I'm getting from pulling my shot in my machine, my grind size is completely inconsistent, whipping around wildly no matter how I change the Baratza setting. This indicates some further fault with my machine, but as I've already replaced the burr holder AND shimmed it, I have no idea what.

My mom raised me alone and we've been struggling financially for 21 years - constantly moving between rental homes because my dad never paid the court-ordered support he was supposed to. I've always had a pretty isolated childhood with very few close relationships.

Few years ago, this woman M (who's about 12 years older than me) became incredibly close to my mom and me. She would talk to my mom every day, and I grew really attached to her. She felt like the family I never had - we'd hang out together, go to movies, have meals. I even started calling her ""didi"", ""maa"" sometimes. She was very qualified and that too from one of the most premier institutes of the country, she has been a guide and inspiration for me.

For the first time in my life, I felt like I had a someone else to call family after my mom.

Then a month ago, M suddenly blocked us on WhatsApp out of nowhere. I was completely heartbroken because I'm so attached to her. We could still talk on Instagram and calls, but she lied to us (her phone broke) and we were blocked on WhatsApp.

I ended up going through my mom's phone (I know, not great) and discovered something that completely shocked me. Turns out I have two older step-brothers from my mom's previous marriage when she was 16. I barely remembered them from early childhood, but my memory had gotten fuzzy over the years. And M? She was dating my eldest step-brother.

M had lost her own mother when she was young, and she was searching for family connections when she found my mom on social media. She tried to help reconcile my mom with my step-brother by reaching out, my mom made his favorite food and sent him through her.  
But my step-brother still harbors intense hatred toward my mom and me

They eventually broke up and he is dating someone else but he forced M to block us on WhatsApp, made her send him screenshots as proof, and made her promise she'd never contact us again.

M told me she'd stay in touch outside of WhatsApp, and we even went for coffee where she said I remind her of my half-brother and that our characteristics match exactly. 

I'm realizing that she probably always just saw me as her boyfriend's step-brother, while I thought of her as genuine family. Having endured a lot of childhood trauma and struggling to make close friends, losing this relationship has completely broken me. 

I thought of writing a letter to my step brother but he blocked me from socials and I told M that i msged him and she blocked from all other socials as well.

1lywi2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/amway/comments/1lywi2y/i_quit_amway_and_wwg_after_going_double_eagle/,I quit Amway and WWG after going Double Eagle. Here’s what you should know…,"Hey everyone, this is my MLM Novel. *(Estimated 12 minute read)*

I wanted to share this for anyone feeling on the fence in Amway/WWG. Hearing why other Eagle/DE/Platinum/Emeralds quit helped me break free from one of the lies they told - that anyone who quits “just wasn’t willing to do the work” or “they lost their mind”. 
The furthest we went was Double Eagle, my husband (then bf) sponsored me right before he went Eagle. We built in a larger US Midwestern market, we eventually attended Moving Up for a couple years and quit before we reached Platinum. It’s been about a year since we’ve been out, and it has been a healing journey. 
I’m not here to be bitter. I’m here to tell the truth about my experience, share some insight, and maybe laugh a little about how weird it really is when you look back. I’m not here to defame anyone or any company. This is just my opinion.

For the record, it wasn’t all bad. We can look back and appreciate certain things from our experience. I give credit where credit is due, so I will start with those for good measure:

* I can handle rejection pretty well now.
* I learned better social/communication skills.
* I learned leadership skills.
* I felt more positive about starting a family and we did.
* It showed me the possibility to homeschool my kids when I’d never thought about that.
* It taught me some helpful parenting principles I still use today
* I learned budgeting principles and paid off some debt.
* I started thinking about retiring my parents and taking on that responsibility.
* I initially grew more confident and was willing to assert myself more.
* It gave me a distraction through tough parts of my life.
* I learned how other businesses work.
* I learned how to interview someone and spot BS a mile away.
* I learned how to be mentally strong.
* I learned how to present and speak in front of an audience
* I did find my faith (although it was more Jesus as a magic business genie, but I’m repairing that relationship now).
* I met interesting people I would not have met if I hadn’t gotten out of my shell.

I believe everything happens for a reason. My journey is my journey. I actually wouldn’t change mine, but **I also would not personally recommend this environment to others**. And here is why…

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1. **The More You “Lead,” the Less You Actually Live**

>Mentor: “Of course having no responsibility feels really nice. It feels great to live selfishly and do what you want all the time. But a real man or woman grows up. Success means responsibility.”

Our experience:

The deeper we got, the less autonomy we had:

* Discouraged from promotions, higher-paying jobs, or any additional income options outside of this business.
* Discouraged from moving to a safer town/neighborhood.
* Discouraged from upgrading a car to a basic SUV.
* Discouraged from visiting grandparents in their 90s.
* Discouraged from getting pets of any kind.
* Discouraged from having a private life of any kind.
* Discouraged from having a social life outside of this environment.
* Discouraged from pursuing talents/outside ambitions (singing and song writing were a big part of my life before)
* Discouraged from traveling —including holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas.
* etc.

Every decision hinged on:

>“Well, do you want that thing…or do you want to get free?”

Here was our rub:

We weren’t afraid of responsibility and higher expectations. But our business was stalled out, and we were getting frustrated because our perspective was to keep delaying everything indefinitely, waiting for the breakthrough (that never came). We were debt-free and had a lot of money, so this advice wasn’t for financial reasons.

There seemed to be a fear that if we weren’t totally miserable or if we felt good about ourselves outside this business, we wouldn’t build our business fast enough. It really felt like they wanted us to borderline hate our life. Their strategy backfired. In reality, it made us resent the business and the mentorship because we felt helpless, controlled + manipulated. We eventually realized our goals weren’t ours anymore—we were just working for what our upline wanted us to be. And we had wanted their approval for too long.

**2.  WWG gets you to believe you are NOT like all the other MLMS. That you are ELITE. This is why Anti-MLM content didn’t dissuade me**

>”We have reinvented the industry, we took the good and left out the bad.”

Partial Truths! WWG of course has its specialties, but it’s not as special as they made it sounds. Many MLMs operate the same way as WWG. Other lines of affiliation have their own Kate, Audio Apps, and Dream Stream tools and teach people to do at least 150pv if not 300+pv. John Maxwell doesn't speak to WWG for free (at least not anymore, and he speaks to many MLMs). Many MLMs have implemented a ”vetting process“ of some kind. Many MLMs promote heavy personal development and family values. Other MLMS believe they are a “Blessed Business, Kingdom Business”, have alter calls, and promote servant leadership with purpose and mission to help people. None of this is not unique to WWG.

And most importantly, we were told WWG IBO’s blow the Amway income claims out of the water!

>“These Amway numbers are Average. But We don’t do average, we do Savage!”

And then—conveniently—we are never told what those “savage numbers” actually are. There are no legal documents showing them. It’s a convenient way to pitch this partial truth: “Our team makes a lot more money than all other Amway people.” Sure, if you have your 12–20 legs, you are in the throes of building a profitable business. But look at a major function—the arena itself shows you the actual stats of profitability in WWG. (You can ignore the Eagle section and much of the Platinum section, because most in those rows are not profitable yet either)

**PSA**: If you are a WWG IBO who does not have width (aka legs under you), I’m very sorry to tell you, you are just like other Amway IBOs. The difference is you may be doing 300 PV-500PV, so you’re simply putting more money in right now (and getting back an extra 3%). But since you’re doing more than 100pv, the **leaders above you with width ARE more profitable**. But if YOU are not sponsoring, that just means you’ll have spent more on products than an “average IBO” and you have a more profitable upline. I hate seeing people putting money into this and then not sponsor people to make it worth it — and I know sponsoring people is hard.

But rememberr:

>”What you do for your upline, your downline will do for you.”

>“The Rule of 500: How would you like 500ppl duplicating your volume?”

I didn‘t realize any of this, I really thought I was part of something special, elite, first-class. Which is why Anti MLM content didn’t penetrated my mind —  I was always able to write off the negative prospects, blogs, TikTok’s, YouTube’s,  etc. If someone said something negative about Amway, I’d immediately think:

>“Yeah, that’s not me. Amway is just the product and payment. We are WWG, we are elite. Amway doesn’t even know what we do”

If someone said WWG  was the problem, I’d tell myself:

>“Maybe for some organizations. But that’s not my upline—everyone is different and I work with the best of the best. My upline is first class.”

It was like there were layers of mental insulation.

* I thought other MLMs were sketchy—even while I was in one.
* But I was convinced what we were doing wasn’t anything like “those other MLMs.”
* And if someone criticized Amway, I’d point to WWG.
* If they criticized WWG, I’d point to my specific upline.

Unless someone had named my exact mentors and described such specific examples of negative situations that I couldn’t deny them (which never happened), I could always rationalize it away.

This is why I think people can rationalize and stay in WWG for decades even when you try to warn them. This seems like some deep psychological sh\*\* to me now that I’m on the other side.

**3. You’re Never Allowed to Call Reality What It Is**  
We once asked when we could think about moving to a better part of town. They said:

>“The most ideal time is when you don’t have momentum in your business.”

When we responded:

>“Yeah, we don’t have momentum right now, so can we move now?”

They countered (in 3rd party fashion):

>“We never tell ourselves or speak out loud that we don’t have momentum. We don’t want to speak that into existence over our business….”

So…you’re only allowed to move when you don’t have momentum…but you’re never allowed to say you don’t have momentum. Got it. Did anyone else deal with this mind f\*\*\*ery?!

**4. Eagle and Double Eagle: Not As Special As You Think**

Eagle and Double Eagle environments were more fun and more intimate. You would have inside jokes with leaders. It was nice to not be in the stands and skip long lines. There were some really great people we got to know. But most people were extremely right leaning. I can get along with anyone so it was not the worst thing in the world, but there was definitely no diversity in leadership. And there were undercurrents of conformity for anyone who wanted to be different.

But don’t lose sleep over Eagle Summits or incentives. The training was basically the same as post-board plan trainings:

>“Put in width, get your 20!”

…with the added pressure:

>“You are the leaders. Everyone watches you. Everyone wishes they were here right now. Go out and put in another Eagleship to prove this works.”

Double Eagle felt more special, obviously. You’d hear more sexual jokes and some tea/gossip because people were more comfortable in those environments. But I thought there would be mind-blowing trainings or life-changing marriage/parenting talks. There weren’t. What made it “special” was proximity to the people, I guess. And our kids could interact with the other WWG kids at some of those incentives.

In those smaller environments, I started finding out that most Platinums weren’t actually “Platinums” anymore. Which meant Emeralds weren’t Emeralds and Diamonds weren’t Diamonds. At all levels, people were stressed about staying their pin and requalifying. Even people with their 20 were struggling to stay Ruby or Emerald.

This was surprising given WWG always touts that they teach how to build the most stable and profitable businesses in the world of Amway. I started realizing the stress I constantly felt to solidify E/DE and go Platinum would probably never go away because most higher level leaders were quietly struggling with the same thing! Our business toggled between Eagle and Double Eagle for almost 6 years which was exhausting.

**5. Coaching and Kates**

Coaching and mentoring can be rewarding and fun, but it is very time-consuming. Answering Kates meant I would have to use my little downtime to respond to people every day.

Rather than walking to collect my thoughts, I had to Kate. Rather than quietly decompressing after “making friends” all night, I was on the couch kating until midnight. Rather than focusing in on my children, I was kating. If you dreaded Kate without a team, now imagine 5–50 additional Kates a day that you have to listen to and respond to. It felt like a job.

Thankfully I adored my team, so it was a labor of love. But unless you send 30-second responses to everyone, this could take hours of your day, especially if you have an “on fire team.” Im not complaining about serving my team, I just started realizing how much time my upline probably spent answering Kates, and then their freedom didn’t seem so free anymore…

If you complained, you were told:

>“This is what you asked for when you asked for a huge organization and influence.”

Is this incorrect? No, but then don’t sell a dream of *10-15hrs a week on the side.*  
I was told my upline Diamond was basically on Kate all day. Sounds fun to look forward to…

**6. Moving Up: Overhyped, Overpriced, Over It**

Moving Up took us yearss to qualify.  I thought it would feel like I’d arrived. Instead, here’s what I experienced at our final moving up:

* Overpriced trip between childcare, flights, hotels, and buying every meal.
* Long, exhausting days of “association.”
* All we did was stand in the pool around leaders for three full days in 115-degree summer heat. It was often awkward because everyone would have asked their questions, and then it would go quiet before someone thought up a new question to keep the conversation going. Cringe. If you tried to “do your own thing” it was looked down on.
* Trainings mostly entailed lecturing Platinums to have better attitudes and serve more at functions. Nothing earth-shattering—and if it was good, they gave it at Family Reunion for everyone else.
* Very awkward and lame night owl with the Diamonds, sharing stories we’d already heard. Everyone fake-laughed and went to bed early.

By the last day, I just wanted to be alone because it felt so forced and performative. I felt guilty for not loving it the way I was supposed to. I finally told my husband (in our last month in business) that I did not like our Moving Up experience at all, and we both laughed because we’d been pretending for each other not to “pass negativity.”

**7. Our Numbers (If You’re Curious)**

* Our best month: ~$2,600 (included Bronze Foundation bonus), Double Eagle with 32 people on the team (not all active).
* Average Eagle income: $1,000–$1,800 with 6–10 legs (team of 20–36 people).

We did pay off debt by following a budget and my husband making good money at his job. I’m glad we saw some money from our hard work in business, but we also had 300 (and sometimes up to 600) PV dittos.

**8. The Business Is Not Bulletproof**

They love to say:

>“It’s recession-proof, pandemic-proof, negative-blogger-proof!”

It isn’t. The last couple of years of major functions, I noticed the lowest attendance I’d ever seen. But instead of telling the truth, leadership said:

>”People got soft during COVID.”

>“It must be your work habit or thought life.”

>“Are you sure you’re talking to people your ambition level and above?”

>“What’s your belief level?”

>”Oh you did do 10 MG1s this month? Then It’s probably your negative thought life. You can’t complain about the results you don’t have from the work you’re not doing…especially the thought life work.”


We were burning out, blaming ourselves, blaming each other, thinking it was personal failure. Only much later did our upline quietly admit sponsor rates were slow for everyone. Finally, I felt validated—and also furious at how we’d been made to feel like we were the problem.

**9. The Masterclass in Plausible Deniability**

Here’s how it works:

In training:

>“We never wanted to interfere with our momentum, so we said no to weddings, birthdays, holidays, vacations because it’s what all successful people do.”

When you start feeling controlled and exhausted:

>“Hey, we never said you couldn’t go on vacation. When did we ever say that? It’s your life!”  
or  
“Hey, it’s what success demands. High achievers in any arena have to say no to things for a short period of time when they’re hyper-focused on a goal. You said you want to be a Platinum ASAP, right?? Well hey, If you don’t want to retire your wife or be a stay-at-home mom, just say so and we’ll coach you differently…”

Proper Translation:

>We’ll pressure you heavily, but if you get really upset, we can say we never explicitly forced you to do anything… If you don’t want to be a REAL man or woman and go Double Eagle Ruby, feel free to let us know you‘re a wimp, you’ve lost your dream, and your goals have changed. And we’ll stop treating you like a leader and stop edifying you from now on (love bombing over).

**10. The Real Trick: Partial Truths**

WWG is tricky because they teach real principles that actually make sense: delayed gratification, scaling a business, sowing and reaping, taking ownership, working hard, keeping a good attitude…But they refuse to admit the real-world context.

If the economy affects your business?

>“No matter the circumstances, anyone can do this if they’re willing to change and be mentored enough.”

If the model is probably too difficult for most?

>“Is that really the story you want to tell yourself? It will always be hard for you if you keep telling yourself its hard”

If you question anything?

>“You need to learn Obedience before understanding.”


Their freedom is a partial truth. They say:

>“Freedom is so real, of course we are free. But we didn’t get free just to sit around and do nothing, we have a bigger purpose. We didn’t get free just to stare at our child all day. We got free to help others. Our kids need to know the world doesn’t revolve around them. There’s no business in the world that doesn’t require some maintenance and time, that’s ignorant.”

The truth is, if you want to maintain or grow your business, you have to spend your nights and weekends doing board plans, prospecting, process meetings, kating.

You’re free from a day job, sure—but you trade it for an evening job that never ends. You sell “freedom” and tell people they can do anything they want when they retire from a job. But I never saw a DER or Emerald in my upline do anything but build this business. Because once you hit those levels, you are told you should wait until Diamond to do those things:

>“Leave the dream building for the Diamonds.”

And if these gemstones decided to stop all activity—never do another board plan, never answer a Kate, stop prospecting and doing process meetings—I would assume their business would dissolve in a year or two.

**11. Psychologically Trapped**

I became scared to leave because I believed:

* I need mentors in my life.
* It’s impossible to raise children without a mentor.
* I’ll get divorced without a mentor.
* I’ll fail at any business I start.
* God will be mad at me if I quit.
* I’ll never find another opportunity as good as this one.
* If I couldn’t succeed here and go Diamond, could I ever succeed at a high level anywhere?
* I wont ever find a community or network like this one that has these awesome people in it.

Guess what, they lied to me! Those are all lies and now I dont live in constant anxiety about my future.

Spoiler Alert: If you’re worried about losing “this awesome network”, remember your crossline were never “your network”, it was always “their network“. You couldn’t even text them.  And if you try to reach out to “their network” of current IBO’s once you’ve left, you will most likely get a text/call about that if your upline finds out. I hope it’s different for you than it was for us. But nonetheless, you can find positive communities that don’t shun you when you leave them outside of WWG.

**12. Final Thoughts**

**Leaders Need to Evaluate Their Mentees Honestly**

In my opinion, most leaders and mentors don’t truly evaluate whether their mentees are actually ready to do the work to succeed—or whether they should even be in business at all. Knowing firsthand how much work it took to put in Eagleships, I started feeling bad when I looked at team members who were doing huge dittos but were nowhere close (in mindset or work habit) to actually building and seeing profit.

>“People have to have skin in the game to commit. If people do 100pv, they’re not taking their business serious enough to have a chance. When they do 300pv, now they’re uncomfortable and will get off the couch and go build the business.”

Okay, but how many months in a row do you need to see people do 300-500pv and they’re still not doing a single meeting. Do your mentors ever say:

>“Hey, you’re not ready yet, and that’s okay. ”

Nope! The truth is, to be a Platinum or Ruby, you need everyone to do the volume—whether they’re all-in or not. So it’s in the leader’s interest to coach everyone to keep paying for big dittos, even if they know that person isn’t anywhere near “activating mentorship.”

Many leaders turn a blind eye and put that pressure on their team and justify it by saying

>“Well, if they want to make money, it’s what’s required in this business!”

But they don’t ask themselves,

>“But is this person ready to sponsor people so they actually get their ROI?”

Thats the real question!!

**As a Leader, You Are the Product**

This is a system where, as a leader, you are the actual product they are selling. Which is why You wear a tighter leash. And you end up trading in more freedoms than you ever receive back. You trade your free evenings, nights, and your ability to make life decisions for daytime flexibility—and even that flexibility comes with strings attached.

The difference between my job and this business is that my job doesn’t pretend to be a business. IBO’s are customers and salespeople/recruiters. And I would assume very few people sell their 70% VCS and have 10 legit customers, so It is still widely a wholesale buying club.

**My Apologies to Anti-MLMers**

I used to hate the Anti-MLM community that would post TikToks and Reddit articles because it would blow out so many of my prospects in the process. I thought I was truly doing a good thing and trying to help people with this business. I felt misunderstood by disgruntled people I assumed never even tried to make the business work, got upset because “it was hard,” and quit. And while sure—some negative things online are written by bitter people—but plenty are written by former leaders who saw the machine from the inside and decided it wasn’t worth it. I wanted every negative article wiped from the internet because I didn’t think it gave people a fair shot to see what I had to offer. Now here I am writing my own Reddit article lol!

If you’re thinking about leaving: you’re not crazy, lazy, or negative. You’re seeing things as they really are and I congratulate you.

**Why Your Upline Acts Weird When You Leave**

Please understand that your upline’s main objective is to protect “the environment.” So don’t be surprised if things get uncomfortable when you tell them you’re quitting.

In our experience, we tried to leave in a way that would preserve the friendship. We told them “It’s not you, it’s us!” We were naive to think we could part ways and still be loved unconditionally. Looking back, I wish I would have been more honest now knowing now it would end the same way.

This was the heart break because we had known these people for years and were constantly told we were “family”. We lived fairly close by, we went to the same church (we’ve since changed churches), they were in our wedding. Our kids were close. Our relationships felt super deep. This past year has been tough. Both my husband and I were so disappointed to see how quickly our upline became weird, passive-aggressive, and paranoid that we would try to take people out with us—even though we gave them no reason to think that. I don’t blame them fully, honestly. When I was fully bought in, I didn’t want to be friends with “quitters” either. It’s a constant us vs. them mentality.

It’s clear now they only want personal relationships with their business assets.

**Life After MLM**

If you already left your MLM—good for you. You survived the endless hope, the blame game, and the pressure to control every outcome with your “thought life.”

Stay strong out there. You’re not alone.

Life is so sweet now.

Our marriage is thriving, we are making more money, we can invest in whatever investment/business opportunities we feel like. Our relationship with family is closer than ever, we have more time with our kids! We have options again, we can move whenever we want, we can vacation. We can attend family weddings! We can buy the cars we want. We got a dog! We don’t have to talk to everyone we see!! No more looming anxiety all the time! No more delaying life bc March or September is coming up. No more stressing if our team isn’t doing volume and wondering if we’ll be Double Eagles this function! No more evenings/weekends filled with malls, grocery stores, coffee shops, and process meetings! No more board plans, no more zoom calls! No more strangers in our home!! No more whiteboard in our living room! No more garage filled with fold up chairs!! No more defending a scammy industry and manipulating people. No more feeling misunderstood by anyone outside of WWG. We feel so free! No more giving high-control over our life.

Lately I’ve been noticing / triggered by hanging out in certain mixed male / female groups and feeling like I have to work 3x as hard than with my female friends to get a word in or feel heard/seen in the group dynamic. I sometimes get really riled up when I experience this in a social setting and tend to vent to my partner. Typically, the men in the group get very passionate about a specific topic and rapid fire off of each other without really engaging women in the group. 

I was hanging out with my bf (audhd diagnosed) and some of his friends, two men and one of the guys’ wife, who I just met. We’re at a bar, drinking. I had two drinks earlier in the night and am only drinking water at this point. The conversation is dominated by the three men. I try to chime in but it doesn’t really feel like I’m part of the niche conversation they’re having. I make sure to interject with plenty of questions to get to know everyone in the circle more, but don’t get asked questions in return from the men, only the wife. In these situations, I find that they typically don’t try to open up the topic of conversation until they’ve exhausted it, which could take an hour or two. Meanwhile, I decide to have a conversation with the wife and we ended up asking each other a lot of getting-to-know-you type questions. I notice that often when the conversation is opened back up to the whole group, when I ask the wife a specific question, the husband interjects and answers for her.

This situation had me pretty annoyed, but I found a way to enjoy myself and overall found the men to be lovely people, but a bit unskilled at making women feel included. In these situations I will leave if I’m not having fun, without hard feelings. I’ll just go elsewhere if I’m putting a lot of effort into getting to know new people and they’re not even making eye contact with me/not talking to me and only to the other men. This way I don’t have to get mad, and they get to have their fun.

ANYWAYS, after we were done hanging out with this group, I vent to my boyfriend about my annoyances with this dynamic and shared my observations for this group hang. I ended up not leaving because I ended up enjoying myself talking mostly to the wife, and because the couple are close friends of my boyfriends who are visiting from out of town. But I still had my observations. 

At home, my boyfriend proceeded to talk up his friend, citing how much he’s done for people and how nice of a guy he is. My boyfriend admitted his friend almost exclusively makes time for other men. In my head, I don’t care too much either way—I don’t think this guy is a jerk, but I found some of his comments disrespectful, and was extrapolating from this specific scenario to the common experiences I face with men, outlining my annoyances. 

My bf continues talking about his friend and how he’s talked down a few male friends from su*c*de. This part of the conversation was very brief - just a few sentences. My bf then starts talking about how so many of these men (the ones who don’t know how to empathize with women) are very lonely and isolated—and I jokingly say, “maybe they deserve it, they should learn to talk to women” continuing on the theme of how I’m sick of men straight up ignoring women in certain social situations. 

My boyfriend gives me a displeased look, and I say “I’m just joking!” and he makes a face. He leaves the room and I say again that I was joking. The two of us were chatting nonstop up until point. So him leaving and not responding feels abrupt, and I can tell what I said upset him. But I don’t understand why, since I don’t find it controversial to say that I don’t really empathize with men who don’t try to empathize with women.

He is in the bathroom for a few minutes then comes back out, turns on the TV, and starts watching it, not saying anything to me. The dynamic now feels extremely different to me. He doesn’t say anything to me for a few minutes. He still hasn’t responded to what I said. I decide to take a shower. It’s 2AM. 

When I come to bed, my bf is already falling asleep. Pretty much every night, even if one of us is already asleep or has been drinking, we cuddle or are always touching while we sleep. This is important to both of us. So I climb in bed and sleepily chat with him about something his friend said earlier that was bothering me, because it was still on my mind. His friend had made a comment about how his mom “wants to fuck” my boyfriend, which I found very off putting. My boyfriend reassures me it was probably a joke and his friends mom probably doesn’t feel that way. My bf is turned away from me through all of this. After we’re done talking about this, I notice he still hasn’t tried to engage me physically, which is atypical to me. No touching or affection like we normally engage in. So, I ask him to cuddle. He lays on his back and scoots a bit closer, and I hug him. He’s not actively cuddling me, just laying on me. I was expecting a hug or for him to use his arms in that moment. The physical touch is enough for me to fall asleep and I do.

The next morning, a Saturday, I wake up and he’s again scooted to his side of the bed, turned away. We don’t cuddle at all. In my head, I’m thinking he was perturbed by my comment and it’s carrying over into him not initiating physical touch or closeness. My brain is telling me that he was annoyed with me and it’s awkward now. He gets up to use the bathroom and I hear him making coffee. He then comes back and says good morning, asking how I slept from the doorway. I respond in kind. 

He leaves to take a shower. About 30 minutes in, I have to use the restroom so I knock and come in to do so. Then I ask him if anything was bothering him from last night. He admits he didn’t like my comment that certain socially awkward men “deserve su*c*de.” I’m appalled and tell him that I was not joking about su*c*de, and that I made a joking comment about how men who don’t care to talk to women “deserve” to feel lonely. I don’t actually feel that way, and I know it might sound harsh, but I was and am fed up with this phenomenon that I keep experiencing. 

He tells me that I never said I was joking. The conversation escalates because I affirm multiple times I did say it was a joke, and not one about su*c*de, and he finally relents he just didn’t hear me say I was joking. Which pissed me off more, since this whole convo is about not feeling heard by men, and I said “I’m joking” very loudly and clearly while making eye contact with him, to which he abruptly left the room. 

The fight continues to escalate, and I ask him if he was avoiding physical touch because my comment upset him. I am emotional at this point, and he’s still in the shower. We’re talking through the curtain. He claims he wasn’t angry or upset, and that NOW he is, because he doesn’t like me assuming how he felt. I tell him that I could tell there was a shift in our dynamic after I made the comment. He swears he didn’t think too much of it. He says that I’m just trying to confirm my own made up story—“confirmation bias,” as he put it, that he was angry with me. He swears up and down he wasn’t upset at all. So I ask him why he didn’t really engage with me physically. He claims he was sleeping, he was drunk, his bodily functions prevented him from touching me or cuddling me like we do every day. 

So now we’re at a stand still. From my POV, I felt the moment he disengaged and saw it continuing through the morning. For him—if I feel this way, then I “don’t believe or trust him.” When I assure him I do, he sarcastically says “oh right, everything is my fault and I’m the bad guy.” In order for us to get over this fight, I have to relent and completely agree that he must not have been mad at me and that the feelings I had about his prompt walking away and not communicating or engaging with me have nothing to do with how he felt and that I’m creating a problem out of nothing. 

If I’m upset with him, to him that means I am naming emotions for him that he claims to not have felt. I apologized for reading into his actions and now he needs “emotional space.” He chose to sleep on the couch last night. I’m going to give him his space, but this doesn’t feel right to me. When I talk to him about it, he is adamant that he wasn’t avoiding me or acting any differently. I tell him I felt what I felt. He says there’s no point in talking about anything if I don’t believe or trust him.

This has happened before. I perceive he pulls away when he’s displeased with me, but he won’t tell me why or will deny he had any negative emotions. I typically have to break the ice and ask what he’s upset about, to which he usually tells me—then when I ask if that’s why he was distant, he makes up excuses for not engaging with me - like being sleepy or aloof. And claims that he wasn’t mad. And it always comes back to me making up stories that have nothing to do with how he actually feels. But I feel crazy because I can tell when there’s a shift, which is why I end up asking him what’s wrong. 

The thing is, I want unconditional affection from my partner. And he denies withholding it. So he becomes the one who is being blamed for something he didn’t do, and I have to apologize for my feelings that are apparently not based in reality. When I bring up that I feel this is a pattern, he flips it and agrees there’s a pattern of me making a problem out of nothing and mistakenly naming his emotions for him. 

Despite telling him in these scenarios that a show of affection would make me feel better, he can’t bring himself to do it apparently. Since we’ve been through this before, we came to the agreement that I’d be proactive about asking for more physical attention. From past situations where I felt he was distant, I ended up apologizing for “putting that on him” and agreed to ask for cuddles more when I’m feeling distance. I have been doing this more for the past year.

In this situation that’s what I did. And when I tell him I felt he was being distant, he points to the fact that he “cuddled me” like I asked him to. If I explain that he wasn’t actively engaging me, he states now I’m “qualifying” his attention and “nothing he does is good enough.” It’s frustrating because on one end he claims he was too sleepy/drunk to show affections as we do every night, but yet he remembers going above and beyond to cuddle me when I asked. And it’s a conversation ender to dispute that.

What is going on? Am I reading too much into his actions? Do I need to reevaluate how I’m looking at this?

tl;dr my boyfriend denies distancing himself when I do something he doesn’t like; he swears I’m just trying to be right about my assumptions ",1,1752422659.0,relationships,4,1.0,False

Joshua woke to the soft chime of the Redhook’s internal bell — a soft, resonant note like a tuning fork struck against crystal. Light filtered through the round window above his bed, catching motes of dust in the air. His breath moved in perfect time with the train’s steady rhythm.

For a heartbeat as he woke up, he didn’t know where he was — then the pulse of the train beneath his spine answered him: the Linehouse.

The lighting in the room gradually warmed, mimicking dawn. Coppery dusk shifted into soft rose-gold. The cabin walls, alive with quiet enchantment, seemed to breathe with the pulse of the train. And somehow he could feel the Linehouse shuddered softly, like a beast stretching its spine, and the gentle pulse that carried him last night still lingered faintly in his limbs.

He sat up. The quilt sloughed off his shoulders, shimmering from iron-gray to a deep amber. His boots were warm — as if they’d been waiting beside a hearth. Every movement came too easy today, as though something beneath the surface of this place had synced to him. Or maybe it was the other way around.

Before he could finish stretching, this time a knock echoed from the cabin door.

“Coming,” Joshua called, already dressing — slipping into his duster, tightening his belt, buckling the holster with practiced ease. There was a smooth rhythm in every motion as if the train had taught his body how to move.

He swung open the door — and nearly collided with a floating tray.

It hovered gracefully, bearing two mugs of something hot and sharp-scented.

“Morning, Joshua,” came the voice behind it.

Ashford stood in the corridor, flame-headed as ever, his vest replaced by a smoking jacket. He sipped casually from his mug, the liquid vanishing directly into the fire where his mouth should be.

“You’re burning daylight,” he said.

“Hey, Ashford,” Joshua replied, accepting the offered mug. “What is this?”

“Hangover cure.”

Joshua sniffed it — steam rose thick with spice and honey. Oddly, he didn’t feel bad after last night’s drinks, but he still took a sip, out of respect for the man’s craftsmanship. It warmed him instantly, all the way down.

“Hey, firsty,” came another voice — nasal, dry, and unmistakably amused.

Flickwick appeared, clutching a box made of driftwood and bone, her shark-like grin already sharp enough to cut glass. 

“You want a drink?” Ashford offered her.

“I’m all good. No offense, but that was nothing compared to what the mad grenadiers distill in their workshop back home. Hella though will need a whole keg of it after the beating she took last night.” She cackled, delighted by her own joke.

Then she turned to Joshua. “Are you coming to breakfast?”

He opened his mouth, but she cut him off with a pointed clawed finger.

“Don’t be the kind of rookie who skips meals. Trust me — you’re gonna need every calorie today.” With that, she spun on her heel and sauntered off, humming something to herself.

Joshua downed the rest of the drink in two gulps, wincing slightly as it seared his throat in the most comforting way. He handed the mug back to Ashford, who nodded and turned down the corridor toward the other cabins.

Then he followed after Flickwick — toward whatever the day had waiting for him.

\-

They descended a spiral staircase that hadn’t been there yesterday and walked across a connector bridge into a car that looked like an old-fashioned rail diner — chrome fixtures and cracked red booths lined both walls, humming slightly with warmth.

“You're up,” Brandon greeted from behind the counter, wearing a chef’s hat and a stained apron. He flipped something pancake-like with a flourish. 

“The food here’s basic normal stuff,” Flickwick said, waving a hand toward the steam trays filled with eggs, oats, flapjacks, and something brown and vaguely sausage-shaped. “But the good stuff, and it’s safe to eat. No one’s ever grown a second mouth from it.”

Joshua didn’t need more encouragement. He helped himself, piling his plate high, then slid into a booth. Taking a bite of the eggs which thankfully tasted like real eggs — maybe a little too fluffy — and trying the juice which was also just... normal juice. It grounded him, he had more than enough magic nonsense from yesterday, and to start off with normal food was plenty for him. 

Around him, other Redhook residents filtered in. Some wore crisp uniforms; others stumbled in still half-wrapped in quilts or wearing bathrobes and mismatched socks. Hella slumped into a nearby booth, clutching her screaming skull-shaped mug like a lifeline and muttering curses under her breath.

Conversation was light until Flickwick muttered through a mouthful of eggs, “Man, imagine if we had cafeteria food.”  

Brandon clutched his chest like he’d been stabbed. “You wound me.”  

“I love your cooking, big guy,” Flickwick replied without missing a beat, “but come on — you know how amazing that stuff is.”

“What’s so special about cafeteria food?” Joshua asked, not knowing the difference. 

“What? Have you never heard of the legends of the school cafeteria?” Velka called out.

“It’s my second day,” Joshua said flatly.

“Well, my friend,” Marrow said, who was thankfully not wearing his face today. “The school cafeteria is the real deal. It’s not just food, but sorcery on a plate. Magic served hot. There is meat from great magical beasts like cuts of leviathan, slivers of phoenix breast, coils of deep-sea wyrm smoked in void spices. Potions are served in runic bowls, thick like stew, each one brewed for strength, clarity, and other effects. Fruits and vegetables fresh from the magical greenhouses each as strange and wondrous as the other. And so many other amazing dishes.” 

“And,” Velka chimed in, lowering her voice theatrically, “they say the recipes are kept in vaults under the kitchens. Behind enchanted locks and eldritch seals. No one’s seen the cooks, not properly anyways. Just shadows behind the steam. Chanting in some strange language.”

Joshua blinked. “That... sounds amazing.”  

“It is,” she admitted. “And also potentially fatal.”  

“Potentially? That place is an ungodly warzone,” Neal stated. 

“I heard there was a food fight over a dimensional cinnamon tart last semester,” Brandon gossiped. “The Lunch Lady got angry and some students got turned into baked goods as punishment.”

Laughing loudly, Flickwick sarcastically remarked, “Don’t tell me they were served for breakfast the next day.” 

Brandon didn’t answer at all. 

Picking up the conversation was surprisingly Virelle, stirring her tea. “The upper classmen and house-legacy, hoard all the magical food for themselves. There is no way they will allow rift-raft like you within ten feet of the place.” 

“Does that include you, Virelle?” Hella asked, raising an eyebrow with a teasing grin. Virelle only sniffed as she turned her head away. 

Joshua stared down at his plate, suddenly wondering why his toast started to feel inadequate.

\-

Joshua was nearly finished with his plate when a faint jingle rippled through the car — high and bright, like sleigh bells dipped in honey and spun through polished brass. The floor beneath his boots gave a gentle thump as something large and wheeled rumbled its way down the aisle.

Flickwick’s ears twitched. “Oho. Look who decided to show up.”

The Trolley had arrived.

It clattered through the dining car like royalty on tour — a towering brass contraption stitched together from ancient vending machines, lacquered cabinets, and rolling carts. It shimmered with fading enchantments and smelled of warm vanilla, cocoa, and just a hint of ozone. Teacups clinked gently against its frame. Jars of glowing lollipops pulsed with soft light. A copper bell swayed atop its frame, chiming in rhythm with no visible breeze.

A velvet curtain fluttered open near the center, revealing more glittering confections inside. The entire machine radiated anticipation.

With a cheerful *ding!*, the trolley rolled to a stop directly in front of Joshua. A lollipop floated forward — perfectly spherical, color-shifting from ruby to cobalt, to silver, to a green so deep it tugged at something in his memory.

Joshua blinked. “What… is this?”

“The Trolley Cart,” Ume said from across the booth. “Oldest resident aboard Redhook, it's always been on the train ever since the first resident came aboard. No one knows who made it, or even what it is.”

The trolley gave a hiss, as if impatient. A coin slot opened at its side with a whispering *shick*, revealing a gleaming brass plate:

**Insert: Currency of Significance.**

Joshua rummaged through his pocket he didn't have much, just pennies and nickels — nothing special which it refused them all. He hesitated, then offered a nickel he’d carried since childhood, one he’d once found in a ghost town.

The trolley *purred*. The coin vanished, and with a delighted hum, the trolley dropped a treat into his hand. The entire machine vibrated like a pleased cat, then rolled onward down the aisle.

Other students reached for their wallets, but the trolley hissed at their offerings — bills, plastic cards, even foreign coins — and rolled away in audible offense, refusing what they had.

Flickwick raised an eyebrow. “Huh. Looks like it liked you. Trolley’s picky. Some folk go a whole year without it accepting a thing.”

Joshua turned the mysterious treat over in his hand. It shimmered black now, and a slow, eerie tune played from deep within it — something nostalgic, yet unplaceable.

“Does it always trade fair?” Joshua asked.

Ume gave him a sidelong look. “Oh, no. It trades *true*. But fair? Depends on who you are and what you gave. You might hand it a coin worth nothing to anyone but you, and it’ll hand you a miracle. Other times, it’ll just belch smoke and give you a caramel that screams when you chew it.”

**\[A/N: You’re dirt-poor, so I’ll let you roll for one treat.\]Trolley Cart Candy Roll: 1 Bad to 6 Amazing**

1. Sour Jawbreaker 2. Black Ghost Licorice 3. Fizzberry Cordial 4. Redhook Rush Bar 5. Conductor's Popdrop 6. Soultrack Swirl

Rolled 2, Black Ghost Licorice

A twisted, matte-black coil of licorice that absorbs light around it. When held in the hand, it feels strangely cold, and when chewed, it crackles faintly like distant whispers or static. It leaves a faint grey stain on the tongue, which barely fades.

Taste: Bitter-sweet, with undertones of ash and mint. Feels like chewing on silence.

Effect – Ghostshade Veil: For the next 24 hours, the user is lightly phased between the physical and spiritual realm. While under this effect: You cannot be detected by basic magical detection spells

\[A/N: Find different currencies & trade it in at the trolley for magical treats!\]

“It’s like testing currencies from other realms,” Hella remarked, nursing her coffee. “Don’t expect it to be so generous next time, newbie.”

“And *don’t* try to rob it,” Marrow added, voice hollow. “One idiot tried last year. Snatched a jar off its shelf. The Trolley screeched like a banshee, spat wheels, and rolled after him full-speed. Then it vanished for a whole month.”

Joshua frowned. “What happened to the thief?”

“Never saw him again. My bet? Ground into candy paste.”

He looked again at the shimmering treat in his hand. It had gone ashen color now, its surface humming with faint whispers. He tucked it away carefully — whatever it was, it wasn’t for now.

Ume drained her tea and stood with a stretch. “Well. You’re one of the lucky few. It likes you. Or maybe it *wants* something from you. Either way… you’ll see it again.”

She gave him a sly wink and tapped her glowing orb awake. “Come on, Joshua. You’ve got class registration next. Time to figure out what kind of mage you’re gonna be — before the train figures it out *for* you.”

\-

Joining the others at a terminal machine once they were done with breakfast, Joshua watched as they tapped things in the display port. The screen shimmered faintly with arcane light, each input met with a chime. Thankfully, Brandon stood nearby, ready to explain.

""It's the train's navigation system,"" Brandon said, pointing to the display. ""You enter your stop here and it’ll drop you off as close as it can.""

""Beats those greedy transport goblins,"" Hella added, stabbing her selection into the panel with one sharp nail.

“There you go,” Marrow said, already tapping away on Joshua’s behalf. “I put your stop at the Class Registry Office. You’re only able to get on and off the train during three specific windows: 6 AM, 12 PM, and 6 PM. Miss it, and you’ll have to wait for the next window. The Linehouse can find you anywhere there's tracks within those hours — assuming you're still alive to be found.""

“Talk about grim,” Flickwick said as she stepped up to enter her destination. “I’m sure the firsty will make it through the first day… maybe.”

“Very funny,” Joshua remarked, eyeing what flicked up to the upper display as it listed the approaching destinations. The first stop read: **Wyrmhollow Forgeworks**

The Redhook Linehouse gave a tired groan as it hissed to a halt, steam curling off its pipes like sighing ghosts. A low bell chimed overhead—three soft notes. The doors creaked open with a hiss. Outside, a massive forge-mountain belched red smoke into the morning sky. Lava channels glowed like veins through dark rock, and golem-smiths hammered thunderously in open crucibles of iron and light. A trio of heavily armored students walked \[ast, one of them hoisting a metal backpack the size of a small coffin.

Velka stepped off and gave them a wave as the doors closed and the train surged away.

Their next stop was called **Mirewood Spire**

A tall tower of gnarled, bark-covered stone rose from a swampy mire, coiled with vines and luminous will-o’-wisps. A canopy of moss-shrouded trees stretched into the foggy distance. Erin who he barely noticed all this time stepped off, boots squelching into enchanted reeds. ""See you later, guys,"" he muttered barely above a whisper, a giant dragonfly buzzed past his head.

Joshua watched the doors seal again. A shudder ran through the train, and the Redhook roared to life.

Finally his stop came, as the train pulled to a halt, Joshua stepped out into an elevated stone platform slick with morning dew. His boots clicked across ancient tiles. The air was crisp and cool, scented faintly with ozone, old paper, and something oddly floral. Around him, dozens of students disembarked from their transports: flying ships, glowing rune-wagons, living statues, one even arriving atop a floating jellyfish.

The platform swelled with activity. Robes flared, familiars leapt from trunks, spell-scrolls unfolded and whispered to their owners. It was like walking into an open-air bazaar for madness. Overhead, a floating brass sign pointed toward **Class Registry** in three languages.

The main road beyond the platform twisted into an uphill spiral. Others floated upward or zipped past on arcane devices. Joshua climbed on foot, his pace slow and steady.

At the summit sat the **Class Registry Tower**, a crystalline spire veined with silver ivy and rotating glyphs. A wide stairway, ever-shifting in pattern and material, led inside. Arcane currents pulsed visibly beneath its translucent surface, and humming spell-sigils drifted lazily in the air like pollen.

A wide stairway led to the entrance, its material shifting with each step—from jade, to marble, to volcanic glass, never quite the same beneath your feet. The moment he stepped through the archway, cool air wrapped around him. The structure hummed like a tuning fork.

Inside, the space opened into a vast rotunda lined with floating marble counters and levitating registry kiosks, each orbited by translucent screens of glowing text. Hundreds of students wandered the open chamber, their expressions bouncing between awe, confusion, and excitement. Above them, banners drifted and curled like scrolls of silk, displaying class rosters, magical regulations, and requirements. 

The attendants that were helping with class registration were beings of shimmering light and shifting form. Ghostly apparitions of knowledge and wisdom, their faces flickered with calm expressions, each voice resonating with uncanny precision, tailored to soothe and direct. They moved with choreographed grace—floating rather than walking, adjusting displays, assisting newcomers, and welcoming every arrival with gentle, personalized greetings.

A sign floated above him in golden script: Welcome, First-Year. Please Begin Your Registration. Your Choices Today Will Shape the Arc of Your Story.

Approaching one of the waiting kiosks, an attendant turned its head and intoned, ""State your name and magical inclination.""

Joshua stepped forward and gave a slight nod. ""Joshua Samuelson. Reinforcement Magic.""

For a brief moment, the attendant’s eyes flared a soft violet, and its voice deepened with ancient cadence. ""Confirmed. Based on your magical affinity and aptitude, the following Class Tracks are now available:""

A glowing row of class options unfurled before him, each glyph pulsing with latent potential...

Classes:

**Alright let's pick your Classes! Come up with what you want to take.**   

*Example*: Guns, lots of Guns

**Class 1: Guncaster Fundamentals: Channeling Through Firearms!**

*""Every trigger pull is a spell.""*

**Instructor:** *Cassian Varn*, a retired Oni bounty hunter feared and respected across realms for his deadly sharpshooting skills and arcane prowess. Once known as the “Crimson Bolt,” Cassian lost his right arm in a dimensional invasion—but returned wielding a mystic prosthetic which seamlessly doubles as a high-caliber rifle and arcane conduit. Gruff, disciplined, and fiercely pragmatic, he teaches from experience—drilling his students with battlefield wisdom, brutal honesty, and the belief that a gun is only as good as the soul behind the trigger.

**Class Type**: Hybrid(Magic + Martial)

**Class Description:**This foundational course teaches aspiring magic gun users the delicate and powerful art of channeling magical energy through firearms. Students learn to transform ordinary bullets into conduits of kinetic and elemental power, enabling their shots to strike with amplified force or supernatural effects. The class emphasizes the harmony between gun mechanics and spellcasting, demanding a blend of precision, timing, and magical control.

While the firearm serves as the primary focus, the class also addresses bodily discipline to prevent magical backlash and weapon overload — critical for any mage who dares to wield gunpowder and mana as one.

**What You Learn:**

**Magical Theory & Core Mechanics**

**Spell Conduction Theory:** How arcane energy flows through non-living materials such as gunmetal, wood, and alloy composites. Why certain firearms resonate better with specific spell types.**Weapon-Magic Synchronization:** The arcane interplay between firing mechanisms and magical timing — how barrel alignment, chamber rotation, and recoil influence spellcasting accuracy and power.**Spell Timing Integration:** Learning to weave spells into combat actions like shooting, reloading, and movement for fluid magical execution.

# Applied Techniques

**Bullet Infusion Methods:** Techniques to imbue bullets with kinetic energy, elemental payloads, or temporary enchantments.**Arcane Target Marking:** Methods to tag targets mid-combat using magical signatures to improve spell homing, tracking, or post-impact effects.**Magical Backlash Prevention:** How to reinforce weapon parts and maintain firing stability to avoid overheating, arc flares, or structural meltdown.**Gun-Body Synchronization:** Reinforcement training that conditions the caster’s body to instinctively align with the weapon — resulting in faster aim, smoother draw, and better recoil control.

# Combat Conditioning

**Magical Recoil Training:** Building the bodily and mental resilience needed to handle arcane-augmented recoil without disrupting casting flow.**Field Spellcasting:** Live combat simulations designed to test reflexes, accuracy, and magical composure under live-fire conditions.

**Class Components:**

**Lectures:**

Arcane energy theory and bullet channeling principles

Magical metallurgy: how bullet composition affects spell efficacy

Gun mechanics and magical integration basics

**Workshops:**

Hands-on bullet enchantment using elemental and kinetic infusions

Practical mark-targeting exercises under pressure

Weapon reinforcement and on-the-fly repairs during simulated combat

**Field Training:**

Live-fire drills combining spellcasting and firearm use

Reaction time enhancement and recoil control under pressure

Tactical drills involving multi-target scenarios

**Skills Gain**: 

**Guncasting**: The foundational skill of channeling magic, spells, enchantments through firearms with precision and control.

**Arcane Firearm Handling**: Mastery of magical firearm mechanics, balancing aim, mana flow, and recoil management. 

**Magical Marksmanship**: Enhanced precision and targeting under pressure, using magic to read battlefield shifts and enemy movements.

**Signature Spell**:

***SpellBullet***: Core offensive spell to infuse bullets with elemental or kinetic magic, amplifying damage and effects.

***Armament Empowerment***: Overcharge weapon with man, enhancing weapon durability, magical energy conduction, and recoil control while supercharging bullet velocity, impact force, and elemental payloads.

**Hitman’s Mark**: By focusing on enemy can gauge mana signature, exposing weak points, magical resistances, and spellcasting style. Once locked on, attacks benefit from enhance bullet tracking and trigger additional spell effects upon impact. 

**Bullet Time**: Momentary slowing of time perception to increase accuracy and tactical advantage.

# Class 2: Arcane Gunsmithing — Building Magical Firearms

**“***Your weapon is your partner — craft it like one.""*

**Instructor:** *Elra Vintock*, a dwarven artificer and former battlefield engineer, known for crafting legendary artillery that have ended wars back on her homeworld. With her enchanted cannon hammer ""Spite,"" she can forge magic into steel and of you with a single shot. Elra teaches with a no-nonsense attitude, demanding perfection from her students — because in her words, “You don’t get second chances when your barrel explodes.”

**Class Type:** Artifice + Applied Magic

**Course Overview**

Arcane Gunsmithing is the essential course for anyone serious about building, modifying, and maintaining magical firearms. Students learn to blend mechanical engineering with enchantment theory, forging firearms that are more than tools — they’re arcane extensions of the wielder’s will.

This class covers every component of a firearm, from barrel composition to trigger enchantments, breaking down how each element can affect spell channeling, magical compatibility, and combat longevity. Special focus is placed on battlefield repairs and mid-combat enhancements — because a true gunslinger doesn’t wait for a break in the fight.

# Class 3: Magical Ballistics: ​​Mastering Magical Ammunition & Gunpowder

*""Every bullet tells a story — master the magic within its flight.""*

**Instructor:** *Liora Fenwick*, a renowned high elf arcane physicist and alchemist whose groundbreaking work on spellballistics revolutionized magitech warfare. Calm, precise, and highly analytical, Liora bridges theoretical magic with practical application.

Class Type: Arcane Science + Alchemy

**Course Overview**

This class dives into the core components that make magical firearms deadly and reliable: the properties of gunpowder, the design and crafting of enchanted cartridges, and the physics of projectile motion infused with magic. Students will learn the chemistry and arcane theory behind alchemical powders, bullet materials, and cartridge construction to maximize damage, efficiency, and utility. 

Special emphasis is placed on the relationship between physical and magical forces during bullet propulsion and flight, as well as how to create reliable, specialized ammo for different combat scenarios. Explores the hidden journey of magical projectiles: how spells behave mid-flight, interact with physical and metaphysical forces, and deliver effects on impact. 

# What You Learn

# Gunpowder & Propellant Science

**Alchemical Gunpowder Formulation:** Crafting powders with different elemental bases (fire, ice, lightning) and arcane stabilizers for enhanced burn rates and magical output.

**Combustion & Mana Release:** Understanding how magical gunpowder combusts alongside mana to propel bullets while maintaining spell integrity.**Powder Quality Control:** Identifying and mitigating contaminants or instability risks that cause misfires or magical feedback.

**Ammunition Design & Crafting**

**Cartridge Construction:** Designing cartridges that efficiently house powder, bullets, and magical foci without disrupting energy flow.

**Bullet Materials:** Selecting and forging metals, crystals, and composites optimized for mana conduction, durability, and elemental affinity.

**Sealing & Enchanting Runes:** Applying protective seals and runes to cartridges for stability, magical discharge control, and enhanced flight.

# Ballistics & Projectile Behavior

**Projectile Physics & Magic Interaction:** How velocity, trajectory, and arcane energy combine to affect range, accuracy, and spell effects.

**Recoil & Pressure Dynamics:** Managing the physical stresses caused by enchanted gunpowder combustion and rapid mana discharge.

**Cartridge Performance Tuning:** Adjusting bullet weight, powder charge, and enchantment strength for specialized rounds like armor-piercing, explosive, or tracking bullets.

# Class Components

**Lectures:**

Ballistics fundamentals: velocity, drag, trajectory with arcane overlays

Chemical and arcane properties of gunpowder and propellantsCartridge engineering principles and magical integration**Workshops:**

Crafting elemental and hybrid gunpowder

Building and enchanting multi-component cartridges

Joshua’s eyes swept across the display where glyphs danced in elegant motion, each pulsing with arcane resonance. Somehow, he understood their meanings — as if the language of magic had always lived just beneath his skin. *Arcane Thaumaturgy. Magical Body Augmentation. Enchanting Foundations. Battle Divination. Fire Element Study.*So many paths. So many possibilities. It was almost too much.

He was grateful for the aide beside him — a luminous figure of shimmering thought and ancient guidance. His dormmates had warned him about the dizzying number of classes at the academy, and how easy it was for first-years to get lost in a sea of options. That’s why these knowledge-spirits existed — to steer new students toward a path aligned with their talents, temperament, and potential.

The attendant’s voice, calm and layered with centuries of understanding, highlighted the courses best suited for him. Joshua studied them, intrigued — but three immediately stood out. Among the swirling lights, three glyphs pulsed brighter than the rest — gunmetal gray, steel-blue, and red-gold — calling to him like old friends.

He reached out, fingers brushing the first shimmering sigil.

**Class 1: Guncaster Fundamentals — Channeling Through Firearms!**

*Every trigger pull is a spell.*

He saw a vision: bullets streaking with flame, a spell-slinger weaving magic through a rifle’s barrel, mana pulsing with every shot. This was the bridge between his old world and the new — between his firearm and his magic.

**Class 2: Arcane Gunsmithing — Building Magical Firearms**

*Your weapon is your partner — craft it like one.*

Sparks flew as enchanted tools shaped glowing steel. In a rune-lit forge, artificers molded soul-bound weapons with sweat and sorcery. This would teach him to not just wield a gun, but forge one worthy of legends.

**Class 3: Magical Ballistics — Mastering Magical Ammunition & Gunpowder**

*Magic in Motion. The science of arcane firepower.*

The glyph erupted with kinetic energy — cartridges bursting with elemental fury, alchemical gunpowder. This was the heart of the weapon, the engine of destruction. Understanding this would tie everything together.

These classes were the perfect fit for him. Without hesitation, Joshua selected all three.

The attendant inclined its radiant head. **“Selections confirmed: Guncaster Fundamentals. Arcane Gunsmithing. Magical Ballistics.”**

The interface shimmered, and the glyphs compressed into three bands of glowing energy that zipped into Joshua’s wrist — burning themselves into his student badge. He winced, then felt a rush of strength flood his limbs, like a pact being sealed.

**“Your schedule has been assigned. Congratulations, Joshua Samuelson. Your path is set.”**

Joshua nodded with quiet gratitude to the ghostly being, then turned toward the exit. With a final glance at the registry chamber — the floating banners, the murmuring crowds, the sacred chaos of first-year possibility — Joshua turned and stepped back into the ever-shifting staircase, the world underfoot cycling through jade, obsidian, and thunderstone. The sun outside cast a new light on his journey — and for the first time since arriving, he felt like he was exactly where he was supposed to be.",1,1752422573.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

Joshua woke to the soft chime of the Redhook’s internal bell — a soft, resonant note like a tuning fork struck against crystal. Light filtered through the round window above his bed, catching motes of dust in the air. His breath moved in perfect time with the train’s steady rhythm.

For a heartbeat as he woke up, he didn’t know where he was — then the pulse of the train beneath his spine answered him: the Linehouse.

The lighting in the room gradually warmed, mimicking dawn. Coppery dusk shifted into soft rose-gold. The cabin walls, alive with quiet enchantment, seemed to breathe with the pulse of the train. And somehow he could feel the Linehouse shuddered softly, like a beast stretching its spine, and the gentle pulse that carried him last night still lingered faintly in his limbs.

He sat up. The quilt sloughed off his shoulders, shimmering from iron-gray to a deep amber. His boots were warm — as if they’d been waiting beside a hearth. Every movement came too easy today, as though something beneath the surface of this place had synced to him. Or maybe it was the other way around.

Before he could finish stretching, this time a knock echoed from the cabin door.

“Coming,” Joshua called, already dressing — slipping into his duster, tightening his belt, buckling the holster with practiced ease. There was a smooth rhythm in every motion as if the train had taught his body how to move.

He swung open the door — and nearly collided with a floating tray.

It hovered gracefully, bearing two mugs of something hot and sharp-scented.

“Morning, Joshua,” came the voice behind it.

Ashford stood in the corridor, flame-headed as ever, his vest replaced by a smoking jacket. He sipped casually from his mug, the liquid vanishing directly into the fire where his mouth should be.

“You’re burning daylight,” he said.

“Hey, Ashford,” Joshua replied, accepting the offered mug. “What is this?”

“Hangover cure.”

Joshua sniffed it — steam rose thick with spice and honey. Oddly, he didn’t feel bad after last night’s drinks, but he still took a sip, out of respect for the man’s craftsmanship. It warmed him instantly, all the way down.

“Hey, firsty,” came another voice — nasal, dry, and unmistakably amused.

Flickwick appeared, clutching a box made of driftwood and bone, her shark-like grin already sharp enough to cut glass. 

“You want a drink?” Ashford offered her.

“I’m all good. No offense, but that was nothing compared to what the mad grenadiers distill in their workshop back home. Hella though will need a whole keg of it after the beating she took last night.” She cackled, delighted by her own joke.

Then she turned to Joshua. “Are you coming to breakfast?”

He opened his mouth, but she cut him off with a pointed clawed finger.

“Don’t be the kind of rookie who skips meals. Trust me — you’re gonna need every calorie today.” With that, she spun on her heel and sauntered off, humming something to herself.

Joshua downed the rest of the drink in two gulps, wincing slightly as it seared his throat in the most comforting way. He handed the mug back to Ashford, who nodded and turned down the corridor toward the other cabins.

Then he followed after Flickwick — toward whatever the day had waiting for him.

\-

They descended a spiral staircase that hadn’t been there yesterday and walked across a connector bridge into a car that looked like an old-fashioned rail diner — chrome fixtures and cracked red booths lined both walls, humming slightly with warmth.

“You're up,” Brandon greeted from behind the counter, wearing a chef’s hat and a stained apron. He flipped something pancake-like with a flourish. 

“The food here’s basic normal stuff,” Flickwick said, waving a hand toward the steam trays filled with eggs, oats, flapjacks, and something brown and vaguely sausage-shaped. “But the good stuff, and it’s safe to eat. No one’s ever grown a second mouth from it.”

Joshua didn’t need more encouragement. He helped himself, piling his plate high, then slid into a booth. Taking a bite of the eggs which thankfully tasted like real eggs — maybe a little too fluffy — and trying the juice which was also just... normal juice. It grounded him, he had more than enough magic nonsense from yesterday, and to start off with normal food was plenty for him. 

Around him, other Redhook residents filtered in. Some wore crisp uniforms; others stumbled in still half-wrapped in quilts or wearing bathrobes and mismatched socks. Hella slumped into a nearby booth, clutching her screaming skull-shaped mug like a lifeline and muttering curses under her breath.

Conversation was light until Flickwick muttered through a mouthful of eggs, “Man, imagine if we had cafeteria food.”  

Brandon clutched his chest like he’d been stabbed. “You wound me.”  

“I love your cooking, big guy,” Flickwick replied without missing a beat, “but come on — you know how amazing that stuff is.”

“What’s so special about cafeteria food?” Joshua asked, not knowing the difference. 

“What? Have you never heard of the legends of the school cafeteria?” Velka called out.

“It’s my second day,” Joshua said flatly.

“Well, my friend,” Marrow said, who was thankfully not wearing his face today. “The school cafeteria is the real deal. It’s not just food, but sorcery on a plate. Magic served hot. There is meat from great magical beasts like cuts of leviathan, slivers of phoenix breast, coils of deep-sea wyrm smoked in void spices. Potions are served in runic bowls, thick like stew, each one brewed for strength, clarity, and other effects. Fruits and vegetables fresh from the magical greenhouses each as strange and wondrous as the other. And so many other amazing dishes.” 

“And,” Velka chimed in, lowering her voice theatrically, “they say the recipes are kept in vaults under the kitchens. Behind enchanted locks and eldritch seals. No one’s seen the cooks, not properly anyways. Just shadows behind the steam. Chanting in some strange language.”

Joshua blinked. “That... sounds amazing.”  

“It is,” she admitted. “And also potentially fatal.”  

“Potentially? That place is an ungodly warzone,” Neal stated. 

“I heard there was a food fight over a dimensional cinnamon tart last semester,” Brandon gossiped. “The Lunch Lady got angry and some students got turned into baked goods as punishment.”

Laughing loudly, Flickwick sarcastically remarked, “Don’t tell me they were served for breakfast the next day.” 

Brandon didn’t answer at all. 

Picking up the conversation was surprisingly Virelle, stirring her tea. “The upper classmen and house-legacy, hoard all the magical food for themselves. There is no way they will allow rift-raft like you within ten feet of the place.” 

“Does that include you, Virelle?” Hella asked, raising an eyebrow with a teasing grin. Virelle only sniffed as she turned her head away. 

Joshua stared down at his plate, suddenly wondering why his toast started to feel inadequate.

\-

Joshua was nearly finished with his plate when a faint jingle rippled through the car — high and bright, like sleigh bells dipped in honey and spun through polished brass. The floor beneath his boots gave a gentle thump as something large and wheeled rumbled its way down the aisle.

Flickwick’s ears twitched. “Oho. Look who decided to show up.”

The Trolley had arrived.

It clattered through the dining car like royalty on tour — a towering brass contraption stitched together from ancient vending machines, lacquered cabinets, and rolling carts. It shimmered with fading enchantments and smelled of warm vanilla, cocoa, and just a hint of ozone. Teacups clinked gently against its frame. Jars of glowing lollipops pulsed with soft light. A copper bell swayed atop its frame, chiming in rhythm with no visible breeze.

A velvet curtain fluttered open near the center, revealing more glittering confections inside. The entire machine radiated anticipation.

With a cheerful *ding!*, the trolley rolled to a stop directly in front of Joshua. A lollipop floated forward — perfectly spherical, color-shifting from ruby to cobalt, to silver, to a green so deep it tugged at something in his memory.

Joshua blinked. “What… is this?”

“The Trolley Cart,” Ume said from across the booth. “Oldest resident aboard Redhook, it's always been on the train ever since the first resident came aboard. No one knows who made it, or even what it is.”

The trolley gave a hiss, as if impatient. A coin slot opened at its side with a whispering *shick*, revealing a gleaming brass plate:

**Insert: Currency of Significance.**

Joshua rummaged through his pocket he didn't have much, just pennies and nickels — nothing special which it refused them all. He hesitated, then offered a nickel he’d carried since childhood, one he’d once found in a ghost town.

The trolley *purred*. The coin vanished, and with a delighted hum, the trolley dropped a treat into his hand. The entire machine vibrated like a pleased cat, then rolled onward down the aisle.

Other students reached for their wallets, but the trolley hissed at their offerings — bills, plastic cards, even foreign coins — and rolled away in audible offense, refusing what they had.

Flickwick raised an eyebrow. “Huh. Looks like it liked you. Trolley’s picky. Some folk go a whole year without it accepting a thing.”

Joshua turned the mysterious treat over in his hand. It shimmered black now, and a slow, eerie tune played from deep within it — something nostalgic, yet unplaceable.

“Does it always trade fair?” Joshua asked.

Ume gave him a sidelong look. “Oh, no. It trades *true*. But fair? Depends on who you are and what you gave. You might hand it a coin worth nothing to anyone but you, and it’ll hand you a miracle. Other times, it’ll just belch smoke and give you a caramel that screams when you chew it.”

**\[A/N: You’re dirt-poor, so I’ll let you roll for one treat.\]Trolley Cart Candy Roll: 1 Bad to 6 Amazing**

1. Sour Jawbreaker 2. Black Ghost Licorice 3. Fizzberry Cordial 4. Redhook Rush Bar 5. Conductor's Popdrop 6. Soultrack Swirl

Rolled 2, Black Ghost Licorice

A twisted, matte-black coil of licorice that absorbs light around it. When held in the hand, it feels strangely cold, and when chewed, it crackles faintly like distant whispers or static. It leaves a faint grey stain on the tongue, which barely fades.

Taste: Bitter-sweet, with undertones of ash and mint. Feels like chewing on silence.

Effect – Ghostshade Veil: For the next 24 hours, the user is lightly phased between the physical and spiritual realm. While under this effect: You cannot be detected by basic magical detection spells

\[A/N: Find different currencies & trade it in at the trolley for magical treats!\]

“It’s like testing currencies from other realms,” Hella remarked, nursing her coffee. “Don’t expect it to be so generous next time, newbie.”

“And *don’t* try to rob it,” Marrow added, voice hollow. “One idiot tried last year. Snatched a jar off its shelf. The Trolley screeched like a banshee, spat wheels, and rolled after him full-speed. Then it vanished for a whole month.”

Joshua frowned. “What happened to the thief?”

“Never saw him again. My bet? Ground into candy paste.”

He looked again at the shimmering treat in his hand. It had gone ashen color now, its surface humming with faint whispers. He tucked it away carefully — whatever it was, it wasn’t for now.

Ume drained her tea and stood with a stretch. “Well. You’re one of the lucky few. It likes you. Or maybe it *wants* something from you. Either way… you’ll see it again.”

She gave him a sly wink and tapped her glowing orb awake. “Come on, Joshua. You’ve got class registration next. Time to figure out what kind of mage you’re gonna be — before the train figures it out *for* you.”

\-

Joining the others at a terminal machine once they were done with breakfast, Joshua watched as they tapped things in the display port. The screen shimmered faintly with arcane light, each input met with a chime. Thankfully, Brandon stood nearby, ready to explain.

""It's the train's navigation system,"" Brandon said, pointing to the display. ""You enter your stop here and it’ll drop you off as close as it can.""

""Beats those greedy transport goblins,"" Hella added, stabbing her selection into the panel with one sharp nail.

“There you go,” Marrow said, already tapping away on Joshua’s behalf. “I put your stop at the Class Registry Office. You’re only able to get on and off the train during three specific windows: 6 AM, 12 PM, and 6 PM. Miss it, and you’ll have to wait for the next window. The Linehouse can find you anywhere there's tracks within those hours — assuming you're still alive to be found.""

“Talk about grim,” Flickwick said as she stepped up to enter her destination. “I’m sure the firsty will make it through the first day… maybe.”

“Very funny,” Joshua remarked, eyeing what flicked up to the upper display as it listed the approaching destinations. The first stop read: **Wyrmhollow Forgeworks**

The Redhook Linehouse gave a tired groan as it hissed to a halt, steam curling off its pipes like sighing ghosts. A low bell chimed overhead—three soft notes. The doors creaked open with a hiss. Outside, a massive forge-mountain belched red smoke into the morning sky. Lava channels glowed like veins through dark rock, and golem-smiths hammered thunderously in open crucibles of iron and light. A trio of heavily armored students walked \[ast, one of them hoisting a metal backpack the size of a small coffin.

Velka stepped off and gave them a wave as the doors closed and the train surged away.

Their next stop was called **Mirewood Spire**

A tall tower of gnarled, bark-covered stone rose from a swampy mire, coiled with vines and luminous will-o’-wisps. A canopy of moss-shrouded trees stretched into the foggy distance. Erin who he barely noticed all this time stepped off, boots squelching into enchanted reeds. ""See you later, guys,"" he muttered barely above a whisper, a giant dragonfly buzzed past his head.

Joshua watched the doors seal again. A shudder ran through the train, and the Redhook roared to life.

Finally his stop came, as the train pulled to a halt, Joshua stepped out into an elevated stone platform slick with morning dew. His boots clicked across ancient tiles. The air was crisp and cool, scented faintly with ozone, old paper, and something oddly floral. Around him, dozens of students disembarked from their transports: flying ships, glowing rune-wagons, living statues, one even arriving atop a floating jellyfish.

The platform swelled with activity. Robes flared, familiars leapt from trunks, spell-scrolls unfolded and whispered to their owners. It was like walking into an open-air bazaar for madness. Overhead, a floating brass sign pointed toward **Class Registry** in three languages.

The main road beyond the platform twisted into an uphill spiral. Others floated upward or zipped past on arcane devices. Joshua climbed on foot, his pace slow and steady.

At the summit sat the **Class Registry Tower**, a crystalline spire veined with silver ivy and rotating glyphs. A wide stairway, ever-shifting in pattern and material, led inside. Arcane currents pulsed visibly beneath its translucent surface, and humming spell-sigils drifted lazily in the air like pollen.

A wide stairway led to the entrance, its material shifting with each step—from jade, to marble, to volcanic glass, never quite the same beneath your feet. The moment he stepped through the archway, cool air wrapped around him. The structure hummed like a tuning fork.

Inside, the space opened into a vast rotunda lined with floating marble counters and levitating registry kiosks, each orbited by translucent screens of glowing text. Hundreds of students wandered the open chamber, their expressions bouncing between awe, confusion, and excitement. Above them, banners drifted and curled like scrolls of silk, displaying class rosters, magical regulations, and requirements. 

The attendants that were helping with class registration were beings of shimmering light and shifting form. Ghostly apparitions of knowledge and wisdom, their faces flickered with calm expressions, each voice resonating with uncanny precision, tailored to soothe and direct. They moved with choreographed grace—floating rather than walking, adjusting displays, assisting newcomers, and welcoming every arrival with gentle, personalized greetings.

A sign floated above him in golden script: Welcome, First-Year. Please Begin Your Registration. Your Choices Today Will Shape the Arc of Your Story.

Approaching one of the waiting kiosks, an attendant turned its head and intoned, ""State your name and magical inclination.""

Joshua stepped forward and gave a slight nod. ""Joshua Samuelson. Reinforcement Magic.""

For a brief moment, the attendant’s eyes flared a soft violet, and its voice deepened with ancient cadence. ""Confirmed. Based on your magical affinity and aptitude, the following Class Tracks are now available:""

A glowing row of class options unfurled before him, each glyph pulsing with latent potential...

Classes:

**Alright let's pick your Classes! Come up with what you want to take.**   

*Example*: Guns, lots of Guns

**Class 1: Guncaster Fundamentals: Channeling Through Firearms!**

*""Every trigger pull is a spell.""*

**Instructor:** *Cassian Varn*, a retired Oni bounty hunter feared and respected across realms for his deadly sharpshooting skills and arcane prowess. Once known as the “Crimson Bolt,” Cassian lost his right arm in a dimensional invasion—but returned wielding a mystic prosthetic which seamlessly doubles as a high-caliber rifle and arcane conduit. Gruff, disciplined, and fiercely pragmatic, he teaches from experience—drilling his students with battlefield wisdom, brutal honesty, and the belief that a gun is only as good as the soul behind the trigger.

**Class Type**: Hybrid(Magic + Martial)

**Class Description:**This foundational course teaches aspiring magic gun users the delicate and powerful art of channeling magical energy through firearms. Students learn to transform ordinary bullets into conduits of kinetic and elemental power, enabling their shots to strike with amplified force or supernatural effects. The class emphasizes the harmony between gun mechanics and spellcasting, demanding a blend of precision, timing, and magical control.

While the firearm serves as the primary focus, the class also addresses bodily discipline to prevent magical backlash and weapon overload — critical for any mage who dares to wield gunpowder and mana as one.

**What You Learn:**

**Magical Theory & Core Mechanics**

**Spell Conduction Theory:** How arcane energy flows through non-living materials such as gunmetal, wood, and alloy composites.

Joshua’s eyes swept across the display where glyphs danced in elegant motion, each pulsing with arcane resonance. Somehow, he understood their meanings — as if the language of magic had always lived just beneath his skin. *Arcane Thaumaturgy. Magical Body Augmentation. Enchanting Foundations. Battle Divination. Fire Element Study.*So many paths. So many possibilities. It was almost too much.

He was grateful for the aide beside him — a luminous figure of shimmering thought and ancient guidance. His dormmates had warned him about the dizzying number of classes at the academy, and how easy it was for first-years to get lost in a sea of options. That’s why these knowledge-spirits existed — to steer new students toward a path aligned with their talents, temperament, and potential.

The attendant’s voice, calm and layered with centuries of understanding, highlighted the courses best suited for him. Joshua studied them, intrigued — but three immediately stood out. Among the swirling lights, three glyphs pulsed brighter than the rest — gunmetal gray, steel-blue, and red-gold — calling to him like old friends.

He reached out, fingers brushing the first shimmering sigil.

**Class 1: Guncaster Fundamentals — Channeling Through Firearms!**

*Every trigger pull is a spell.*

He saw a vision: bullets streaking with flame, a spell-slinger weaving magic through a rifle’s barrel, mana pulsing with every shot. This was the bridge between his old world and the new — between his firearm and his magic.

**Class 2: Arcane Gunsmithing — Building Magical Firearms**

*Your weapon is your partner — craft it like one.*

Sparks flew as enchanted tools shaped glowing steel. In a rune-lit forge, artificers molded soul-bound weapons with sweat and sorcery. This would teach him to not just wield a gun, but forge one worthy of legends.

**Class 3: Magical Ballistics — Mastering Magical Ammunition & Gunpowder**

*Magic in Motion. The science of arcane firepower.*

The glyph erupted with kinetic energy — cartridges bursting with elemental fury, alchemical gunpowder. This was the heart of the weapon, the engine of destruction. Understanding this would tie everything together.

These classes were the perfect fit for him. Without hesitation, Joshua selected all three.

The attendant inclined its radiant head. **“Selections confirmed: Guncaster Fundamentals. Arcane Gunsmithing. Magical Ballistics.”**

The interface shimmered, and the glyphs compressed into three bands of glowing energy that zipped into Joshua’s wrist — burning themselves into his student badge. He winced, then felt a rush of strength flood his limbs, like a pact being sealed.

**“Your schedule has been assigned. Congratulations, Joshua Samuelson. Your path is set.”**

Joshua nodded with quiet gratitude to the ghostly being, then turned toward the exit. With a final glance at the registry chamber — the floating banners, the murmuring crowds, the sacred chaos of first-year possibility — Joshua turned and stepped back into the ever-shifting staircase, the world underfoot cycling through jade, obsidian, and thunderstone. The sun outside cast a new light on his journey — and for the first time since arriving, he felt like he was exactly where he was supposed to be.",1,1752422450.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1lywbf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1lywbf0/my_mother_has_seen_me_do_shameful_things_and/,My mother has seen me do shameful things and seems to weaponize them against me.,"I recently turned 18 and I am a male for context.

My mother caught me masturbating recently, I can't lock my door because when I asked if we could get a door with a lock, she angrily said it's gonna be too expensive(it's not).

Before that, she found a box from a sex toy I bought then threw away, but the box remained. She likes searching for stuff in my room, because she wants to find evidence of me eating something she doesn't like (anything that is not her cooking).

She has also seen a few nude pictures of me because I swapped phones with my dad and she searched the phone for old pictures on it.

Another big thing is that I always tell her about the things that happen in my life, because when she asks about my life and when we talk she seems genuinely interested and supportive.

I've talked to her about the girls I like, about a break up with one of them, all my bad thoughts, but every time I regret sharing them with her because when I mess up a little she reminds me of these bad moments in my life when I was weak and these are very sensitive moments to me.

I know these things are on me, but I wish she just forgot about this instead of reminding me. At this point in my life she knows way too much embarrassing things about me. I know it was me who told her, but I needed to talk to someone about this and I would never talk about this with a friend, I genuinely thought she was a safe person.

She gets upset about little things and then tries to insult me by reminding me of sensitive things I've told her and the things she's seen me do. Today she got upset about the fact that I drank coffee a little too late(8pm) and she started ranting about how I do nothing but masturbate (It is not true, but she likes to remind me that she knows about this aspect of my life) and that I will never be lucky or successful (referencing our recent conversation topic about how I want advice on success) if I keep doing things she doesn't like.

She says that my classmates hated me for a reason, that I will always be hated if I keep doing these things she doesn't like(e.g. eating things she doesn't cook, doing things she has little clue about like the gym, taking painkillers when I am sick). She keeps reminding me about how my friends are more successful (I told her I was insecure about this), compares me to them and says that ""no wonder they're doing better"" when I just slightly disagree with her. She sometimes calls me stupid or lazy. (which she knows are my trigger words). She says that everything bad happening to me is my bad karma from doing little things like these.

She keeps joking about the sex toy I bought, about the nudes, about my masturbation, I told her to stop but I think she likes getting a rise out of me, it only fuels her insults. All of my insecurities are used as weapons in an argument. I told her multiple times that I won't speak to her unless she stops. She acts normal and when I think she's changed, it starts all over again.

I know I am not completely in the right here, but what do I do about it? I've just started to get my life together, getting disciplined and stuff but I keep getting humiliated and I can't escape because she's always home. She also won't shut up even when I try to stay alone in my room she bursts in and continues to say all these humiliating insults.",1,1752422343.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1lyw9g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalminimalism/comments/1lyw9g5/analog_sundays_a_secular_ritual_for_the_digitally/,Analog Sundays - A secular ritual for the digitally exhausted,"https://preview.redd.it/yyvbb6lkxncf1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=7445db037da6760918dbe77e368b88c1580c1e7f

Here is a modest proposal: **Analog Sundays.** A single day—just one out of seven—when we deliberately, consciously, even ceremonially, **leave our phones behind**.



We carry in our pockets a device more powerful than the rockets that once took humans to the moon. It allows us to speak to anyone, summon information from the furthest corners of human knowledge, document our breakfasts in 4K—and yet, we use it mostly to refresh apps, stare into the curated lives of strangers, and check if Arsenal has finally bought a striker.



The smartphone, for all its brilliance, has become a paradoxical object: a tool of connection that so often leaves us feeling more disconnected than ever. Disconnected from the people in front of us. From the taste of our coffee. From the feel of a morning sunbeam falling across the table. From our own minds, which, when not anaesthetised by infinite scroll, still have things to say.



Not as punishment. Not as virtue signalling. But as **a tender refusal**. A way of saying: I would like, for a moment, to experience my life **unfiltered**. I would like to remember how it feels to be bored, to get lost, to read a book slowly, to look around a room and realise that nothing is happening—and that perhaps, this is enough.



**The New Rules of Sunday Play**

* You leave the house without your smartphone. Not in your pocket. Not on silent. Not tucked away in airplane mode. It stays behind, like an overbearing chaperone given the day off.
* If you absolutely need a way to be contacted in an emergency, you are permitted to carry a **brick phone**—one of those charming relics that can call and text but can’t ruin your morning by showing you an email marked “urgent.”
* If you anticipate beauty, take a **disposable camera** or a **polaroid**. One photo at a time. No filters. No edits. No obsessive retakes. Just a blurry slice of reality, preserved imperfectly and therefore, more truthfully.



**Objections** 

**“But what if I get lost?”** Then you get lost. It’s worth recalling that for the vast majority of human history, we navigated without glowing rectangles. Getting lost is how we discover parks, bakeries, ourselves. Plan your route ahead if needed. Or stay local. But let yourself drift. Detours are often the only way home.

**“But what if I get bored?”** Excellent. That’s the whole point. Boredom is not the absence of stimulation, but the beginning of deeper thought. Take a book. A notebook. A child. A question you haven’t answered in years. Learn to sit with the fidgety discomfort of unoccupied time. It might turn out to be more fertile than any app.

**“But what if I miss something important?”** You will. Life is about missing things. That is the nature of time, choice, mortality. Every hour we spend looking at something means we are not looking at something else. But perhaps, just this once, we might choose to miss the noise in order to hear what’s been quietly waiting underneath it.



**Why This Matters**

Phones are not evil. But they are *clever*. Diabolically so. They promise efficiency but trade it for addiction. They offer us access to everyone and everything, but ask in return the very thing we once gave to our lovers, our children, our quiet walks: **attention**.

By simply carrying them, we are already halfway gone. The mere *possibility* of distraction seduces us. Our hand twitches at red lights. Our minds drift during dinners. We live in a state of constant micro-absence, always elsewhere, always alert, never really *with*.

Analog Sunday is a ritual of re-presence. Not because we are better people without phones, but because we are **more human without constant interruption**. We remember how to talk to each other. How to notice the sky. How to be unsure of the time. How to let the day unfold without surveillance.



**In Conclusion: A Modest Act of Defiance**

In a world that equates value with productivity, presence with posting, and reality with its digital double, Analog Sunday is a **small rebellion**. A way of saying:

>*I refuse, for this one day, to live mediated through a machine. I want to feel the raw, unprocessed version of my life. I want to be here, now, fully, uselessly, gloriously unproductive.*

And if, during your walk, you spot something beautiful—a tree, a cloud, a child laughing at pigeons—you may not be able to post it. But you will have seen it. And that, perhaps, is already enough.",1,1752422208.0,digitalminimalism,1,0.67,False

1lyw7nj,https://i.redd.it/yhh09nokyncf1.jpeg,Unlock your metabolic power.,"Unlocking your metabolic power means boosting your body's ability to burn calories efficiently. Here are 10 powerful tips to help supercharge your metabolism:


🔥10 Tips to Unlock Metabolic Power

1. **Build Muscle with Strength Training**
   Muscle burns more calories than fat—even at rest. Lift weights 2–3 times a week.

2. **Eat Enough Protein**
   Protein has a high thermic effect, meaning your body uses more energy to digest it. Include protein in every meal.

3. **Don’t Skip Breakfast**
   A healthy breakfast jumpstarts your metabolism after a night of fasting.

4. **Drink Green Tea or Coffee**
   Both contain natural stimulants that can slightly increase calorie burn and fat oxidation.

5. **Stay Hydrated**
   Water helps maintain optimal metabolic function. Cold water may slightly boost calorie burning as your body warms it.

6. **HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)**
   This workout style burns more fat in less time and keeps your metabolism elevated for hours afterward.

7. **Eat Small, Frequent Meals**
   Spacing out healthy meals and snacks every 3–4 hours may prevent metabolic slowdowns.

8. **Prioritize Quality Sleep**
   Poor sleep disrupts metabolic hormones like insulin and leptin, leading to weight gain.

9. **Manage Stress**
   Chronic stress raises cortisol, which slows metabolism and promotes fat storage.

10. **Avoid Drastic Dieting**

Well, until about 3 weeks ago when we had a massive pipe burst in our house and basically everything in our kitchen was pretty seriously damaged or destroyed, including both of those (who could have forseen that hundreds of gallons of water shouldn't be spilled onto your coffee equipment?). Thankfully insurance is going to cover it but it does mean I need to replace both of these.

So with that in mind I figured I should get some opinions on if I should take this opportunity to upgrade. In general I make myself and my wife (and sometimes our roommate) milk drinks each morning and occasionally 3-6 drinks in an evening when we have people over. Ocassionally we'll have a board game day and have a \*lot\* of people over and I might end up making as many as 20 or 25 drinks throughout an afternoon, so I really want something with a decent workflow. I drink straight espresso as well and enjoy medium roasts but noone else does, it's all milk drinks.  
  
I'm willing to give up a tiny bit of taste for a significant quality of life upgrade, which is making me think maybe a GBW grinder is the way to go. I live about 20 minutes from Chris's Coffee, which posts seem to think is a fairly good place to purchase from and it looks like they do service, so it presumably makes sense to buy something from them for ease of servicing. I'm looking at either the Quick Mill QM67, the Quick ill Vetrano 2B, the Bianca V3 or the Izzo Alex Duetto IV Plus combined with the Eureka Mignon Libra.

Context from the same post:me(18f), my cousins Jen (f20) and Jay(15 almost 16 m)

So my uncle(my moms older brother), my aunt and two cousins Jen and Jay live literly two minutes away from us and thats walking distance. When l was a kid we would see eachother almost evey day but we now see eachother less frequently, maybe a few times a month.

I was never that close with Jen though l tried to be but since l already talked about her on my earlier post about my birthday l will talk about my aunt who we will call Susan.

My aunt susan like my cousin Jen is also the type of person to put on a preformance infront of people to seem ""perfect"" and lovely and kind while they love to talk behind peoples backs and gossip.

I started noticing recently that my aunt really likes to ""tease"" me about drinking. Where lm from people start drinking quite early even in elemantary school. I never got drunk and maybe went to 2 or 3 parties ever that were not birthdays(l never drank alcohol during them and she knows). I do drink a bit sometimes especially now that lve turned 18. My dad loves drinking though lve never seen him get drunk or do something inapropreate so hed give me wine to try from him over the years and thaught me how to drink safely like never to mix drinks becouse that gets you frunk fast and so on. My mom on the other hand has low tolerance for alcohol and hates drinking wich my aunt of course knows.

Its started a while back when Jen was turning 18 and l was 16 that l noticed months in advance my aunt would jokingly ask what l would be drinking for Jens birthday(alcohol) as Jen had two parties. One for friends and one for family. I was invited to both. My mom never said anything or really paid attention to it but l noticed my aunt giving her theese glances to see if shes paying attention when she asks me questions like theese. I didnt drink and l told her so multiple times. I had one somersby wich is barely any alcohol and drank one the whole night as well as water.

And for my 18th birthday for my moms side of the family my dad poured me a glass of wine after dinner as he knows it wouldnt affect me and that l wouldnt even get tipsy. My aunt who was close to me imedeately jumped at the oprotunity to tease me and say things like ""oh so we know how to drink?"" and ""l didnt know you drank..."". Neadless to say l was confised and a bit uncomfortable mostly becouse it was infront of other people. Later l figured out not only is she bothering me but shes kind of doing it to get a dig at my mother for not drinking wich just annoyed me more.

Also when theyd come over for coffee in the evening to chat and one time instead of sitting with them for a bit first l just said hi and went to my room as l was watching a movie(this was a few months before my birthday).

 Not even 5 minutes after somebody knocked on my door and guess who... it was my aunt coming to ask me a 100 questions becouse she needed to know absolutely everything about my life. I love her l really do but its just the comments she makes especailly when l know theyre meant for my mom who l aplaud becouse she has masterd not carring😂.

I used to be a bit more on the introverted side as a child and l was prety calm while Jen had to have her way in everything. I just stayed quiet and now that lm 18 lve started gaining more confidence and carring less about what other people think. But family? I cant just tell off a family member l see often... 

Both she and my cousin seem so fake to me sometimes l just keep quiet around them becouse l dont know what to say. Im closer with Jay as hes relaxed and doesnt have that attention seeking trait like Jen and my aunt do.

Does anybody know how l can still politely let them know how to back off in theese situations? Im tired of just keeping quiet.

Theyre comments can sometimes be so passive agressive and they do it infront of everybody when we have get toghethers. Honestly l just want to find a way to not say anything mean but kind of shut them up. As of lately lve been less tolerating but l dont want to be annoyed or get upset l just want to learn how to handle them and their behaviour.

Any tips?
Also any way l can subbtly get revenge?

I’m gluten free due to a bad intolerance causing hives, stomach issues and horrible headaches. 
Went on vacation for a week with husbands family. My husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary there one day by going to get coffee and I got a gluten free donut. The next day, his sister and her husband went out to the same place, they brought back enough donuts for everybody to have one and split one with somebody. So 1.5 donuts each basically. When they arrived back to the house they announced that they completely forgot to order gluten free options for me. I was okay with that, not a big deal. It shouldn’t be their responsibility to cater to my ‘allergy’ I suppose. But the comment that was made by his sister afterwards is what hurt my feelings a little. After her husband said ‘we realized after we ordered that we should have gotten you one too, sorry.’ His sister said ‘but you had one yesterday anyway, so you’re fine’ 

I mean, that hurt a little but I ignored it and ate some yogurt for breakfast. Later, I told my husband how the comment stung a little bit but it was whatever, I’d get over it. But apparently, according to him, I had no business feeling hurt by the comment because it shouldn’t be their responsibility to make sure I have stuff to eat. He ended up getting upset with me over this and caused a fight, which he did eventually end up apologizing for. 

Fast forward to today, three days later, I got upset about something minor and snapped at him over it and he blamed my mood swings on ‘my cycle’ which is just absolutely absurd and said ‘don’t you think maybe it’s just that time of month and you’re moody, you cried over a donut the other day’. Leaving me again to feel like my feelings are invalid.

1lyvzov,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1lyvzov/why_choose_the_lavazza_classy_plus_coffee_machine/,Why Choose the Lavazza Classy Plus Coffee Machine for Your Kitchen?,"The Lavazza Classy Plus has been part of my daily coffee routine for the past few weeks, and it has managed to both impress me and leave room for a few critiques. Labelled as the ""Lavazza Expert Coffee Classy Plus Single Serve ALL-IN-ONE Espresso & Coffee Brewer Machine - LB 400,"" it promises an elevated coffee experience for home and office use. With a built-in milk frother, compatibility with Lavazza Expert and Blue capsules, and the ability to craft different beverages like espresso, lattes, and cappuccinos, it certainly caught my attention as a coffee enthusiast. But beyond the marketing claims, here’s what I discovered under regular use.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design is sleek, modern, and perfectly compact. Measuring 7.87 inches in depth, 18.9 inches in width, and 13.78 inches in height, the machine fits neatly on my kitchen counter without hogging unnecessary space. Its black exterior looks elegant, though it could attract fingerprints, so I found myself wiping it down often. The adjustable height for cups and milk containers adds practicality, especially when preparing different drinks. While its lightweight construction makes it easy to move around, this seemingly comes at the cost of feeling slightly less durable.

**Performance and Ease of Use**  
As someone who can barely function without caffeine in the morning, I appreciated how user-friendly this machine is. It doesn’t require a degree in engineering to figure out. The push-button interface simplifies the process of selecting your desired drink – be it an 8 oz coffee, a cappuccino, or even a double-shot espresso. The brewing time is quick, typically a couple of minutes depending on the drink, which is a bonus for rush-hour mornings. However, I noticed the milk frother can be a bit meticulous, needing proper cleaning to maintain efficiency. Forgetting to clean it just once led to inconsistent frothing the next day.

**Features and Versatility**  
This is a multi-functional gem for coffee lovers. The wide range of beverages includes everything from basic espresso shots to frothy macchiatos. I often leaned towards its double shot function during long workdays for an extra caffeine kick. The compatibility with Lavazza Expert and Blue capsules broadens flavor options, making it easy to explore different blends. One minor hiccup, though, is the capsule exclusivity. If you’re used to other brands of pods, transitioning might feel a bit restrictive. It’s worth noting that these capsules aren’t the cheapest either.

[Ready for Lavazza Classy Plus? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b08j8j3s4y/)

**Good Points**  
- Compact and elegant design  
- Adjustable heights for different drink preparations  
- Simple interface and fast brewing process  
- Built-in milk frother adds café-like experience  
- Compatible with a selection of Lavazza Expert and Blue capsules  

**Flaws**  
- Capsule exclusivity can be limiting for other capsule brand users  
- Milk frother requires frequent cleaning for consistent performance  
- Slightly less durable construction due to its lightweight material  

**Competing Products**  
When compared with machines like the Nespresso Vertuo Plus or the Keurig K-Café, the Lavazza Classy Plus holds its ground well in certain areas but lacks in others. While the Nespresso Vertuo is praised for its incredibly smooth crema and broader capsule variety, it lacks an integrated milk frother, which is a big plus for the Lavazza. On the other hand, Keurig K-Café wins points for its versatile pod options (compatible with non-proprietary ones) and dishwasher-safe components. However, the slightly better milk frothing quality of the Lavazza Classy Plus makes it lean towards replicating a more authentic café experience. In terms of compactness, this machine triumphs over both, catering well to homes and small offices with limited space.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
As someone who values both affordability and functionality, the Lavazza Classy Plus offers an appealing balance. It’s reasonably priced for what it delivers – an all-in-one coffee machine built for versatility and performance. However, it’s worth considering that rival machines may offer better cost efficiency if broader capsule brands or dishwashable parts are important to you. If the exclusive Lavazza capsule system aligns with your flavor preference and you’re all about stellar milk-based drinks, this machine makes a justified investment.

1lyvyk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1lyvyk4/does_the_hamilton_beach_flexbrew_singleserve/,Does the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Single-Serve Coffee Maker Review Surprise You?,"Even though I’ve used countless coffee makers, the Hamilton Beach 49900 FlexBrew Single-Serve Coffee Maker intrigued me with its hybrid brewing options. I’m a bit of a coffee enthusiast, so I decided to give it a spin. Testing it out during my typically hectic mornings felt like a good idea, especially since it claims to brew both K-Cup pods and ground coffee. I’ll admit it: as much as I love freshly ground coffee, those convenient pods can save me a lot of time—especially on rushed weekdays.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The slender profile of this single-serve coffee maker immediately caught my attention. Measuring less than 5 inches wide, its compact size fit like a charm in my cluttered kitchen, where counter space is always at a premium. Its sleek black exterior doesn’t just blend into the kitchen—it looks modern and stylish without being too flashy. The touch-sensitive controls only add to that premium vibe; they respond quickly with just a light tap, making the device feel almost futuristic. The water reservoir, sitting snugly at the back, is easy to fill and lets you brew up to 14 oz. of coffee in one go. While this machine certainly saves space, the lightweight feel of some components does make me wonder about durability over time. 

**Brewing Options and Ease of Use**  
Using this coffee maker is as straightforward as its design suggests. It features two brewing methods: one for K-Cup pods and another for ground coffee, using the included reusable brew basket. I brewed a pod early on one chaotic Monday morning—it took just over two minutes to give me a much-needed 8 oz. caffeine boost, which I appreciated. On weekends, taking my time with coffee grounds and the stronger 14 oz. option has been a pleasant ritual. Also, being able to select between regular and bold brew strengths with the touch-sensitive controls lets me pick my poison depending on my mood. There were a few times the bold setting didn’t taste drastically stronger, but the fact that it’s there is still a definite plus for stronger coffee lovers.

[Check Hamilton Beach 49900 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b095hy42vf/)

**Advantages**  
- Slim design saves counter space, perfect for smaller kitchens.  
- Two brewing options allow users to toggle between pods and grounds.  
- Brewed coffee stays hot enough to drink without scalding.  

**Performance and Speed**  
This device doesn’t keep you waiting. Brewing an 8 oz. cup of coffee takes roughly two minutes, whether you're using a pod or coffee grounds. Considering my old multi-serve coffee maker takes longer with more setup, this was impressive. However, there’s no warming plate to keep coffee warm after brewing, so I often found myself rushing to pour the coffee into a thermal mug. Morning delays? Not a coffee maker's friend.

**Drawbacks**  
- Noisy on startup, which might bother early risers in quieter households.  
- Lack of a warming plate limits flexibility if you’re not drinking coffee immediately.  
- Water reservoir’s relatively small size requires frequent refills for heavy caffeine drinkers.  

**Filter and Cleanup**  
The reusable filter provided simplifies cleanup and prevents excessive waste since you’re avoiding disposal of cheaper, flimsy paper filters. Plus, you’re doing the environment a favor by cutting down on single-use filters altogether. However, cleaning it daily is necessary, as residual coffee grounds can cling stubbornly to the basket. Whatever residue remains typically requires hand-washing or stiff rinsing.

**Competitive Options**  
Though this coffee maker does a solid job, it’s fair to compare it with more established peer products. Keurig models are the obvious competition here, offering similar brewing flexibility but at a steeper price. While Keurig machines generally feature larger water reservoirs and quieter operation, they lack the compact design that makes this one a space-saver’s dream. Another comparison can be drawn with Ninja Single-Serve machines, which pride themselves on durability and hot brewing cycles. However, they tend to come bulkier and more expensive, making them less appealing for a one-coffee-drinker household.

**Quality for Price**  
After a couple of weeks of use, I believe this coffee maker sits well within the sweet spot of price-to-quality ratio. Its budget-friendly nature and versatile brewing options make it a practical choice for students, single coffee drinkers, or even anyone just trying to save a little extra counter real-estate. While some minor drawbacks like momentary noise or modest water capacity are evident, these are compromises I can live with given the affordability.

1lyvw9p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lyvw9p,How I cleared up my folliculitis.,"I posted on here a few weeks ago looking for tips on how to get rid of my stubborn folliculitis.

Just to give a bit of background, I’ve had it for around 2/3 years and it always gets worse in the summer. One thing I want to highlight is that even though every single doctor I saw told me it was bacterial, mine was actually fungal. I think fungal folliculitis gets overlooked so often. If you’re someone who flares up in hot weather or after sweating, I would 100 percent look into fungal treatment.

Once I figured out it was fungal, I tried everything: creams, ketoconazole wash, antifungal diet, oral antifungals, the lot. But honestly, there are a few things that made the biggest difference for me.

Sweat was the biggest trigger by far. Fungus can only grow in warm, damp conditions, so the less you sweat, the better. Obviously that’s not always realistic, especially if you live somewhere hot or have a physical job, but managing sweat helped massively.

If I do sweat, I wipe down my skin straight away using a fungal-safe wipe (I use Water Wipes in the UK) and dry the area off after. I try to shower as soon as I can too.

Clothing made a huge difference as well. I started wearing bandeau tops or really loose fitting breathable fabrics and it helped so much. It meant changing my style a bit and buying a few new tops but honestly worth it. I also bought a neck fan and that’s been a lifesaver for keeping my back dry.

The second I stopped wearing tight material on my back, I noticed I didn’t sweat nearly as much.

I also stay super hydrated with cool drinks and avoid anything that raises body temp like coffee. That one was hard for me but it did help. If you can’t avoid sweating at all because of your lifestyle or job, you could look into Botox after your infection is cleared. It only gives temporary relief but might be worth it for the summer months.

As for actual treatments, I used a mix of ketoconazole shampoo and clotrimazole 2% cream. Both are over the counter. Not all antifungal products are the same though, so definitely check ingredients on sezia.com. For example, I found that Nizoral had a few ingredients that could feed fungus, but the Boots own brand ketoconazole didn’t.

With clotrimazole cream, I apply it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. It gives around 12 hours of protection, so doing it consistently really helps. I always apply a really thin layer, just enough to cover the area. You shouldn’t even feel it on your skin. Thicker layers actually made things worse for me, probably because the cream itself still has some ingredients fungus likes.

I’ve also used medicated powders like zinc oxide or miconazole nitrate to stay dry, but again, it’s important to check for fungal feeding ingredients.

Another thing that helped me was very gentle exfoliation. I use a soft exfoliating glove and lightly go over the area in the shower once or twice a week. Nothing too harsh, just enough to keep pores clear without irritating the skin.

I avoid moisturisers and body washes that might feed fungus. Right now I’m using Dr. Organic’s tea tree body wash. If my skin feels dry, I use C8 MCT oil, leave it on for 10 minutes and then wash it off in the shower. It’s antifungal and doesn’t feed yeast as long as you buy C8 or C10 only. Also I always stick to lukewarm showers now, hot ones made my skin worse.

Other things I did: I took a two week course of fluconazole, changed up my diet, cut out caffeinated coffee and started taking zinc, vitamin D and s. boulardii (which is a good yeast that can help if you’ve got gut issues contributing to it).

Fungal folliculitis is honestly such a nightmare to deal with, especially when it keeps coming back. But it is treatable. Sweat management was the biggest piece of the puzzle for me, and I just wanted to share what worked in case it helps someone else.",1,1752421294.0,Folliculitis,0,1.0,False

1lyvv3k,https://i.redd.it/8pwrw8ezvncf1.jpeg,Part 5 - My dating era in Canada,"Finally touched down na sa Toronto. Nung nakalabas na ako sa arrival area tung friend ko and kasama niya sumundo hindi ko makita 😂 pano ba naman kasi dun sila sa international arrival naghihintay eh ako yung nilabasan ko nasa domestic flights kasi nga diba galing na ako ng Vancouver kaya tawang tawa kami nung nagkita na kami. I am so happy kasi nakaapak na ako sa Canada for the first time and this is one of my dream countries na gustong mapuntahan. 

While traveling papunta sa place ng friend ko dun na ako nag update sa fam ko and closed cousins ko nasa Canada na ako. After awhile nag post narin ako sa FB ko ng video ko na nasa Toronto airport ako and viola gulat mga fb friends ko hahaha tadtad ako ng messages sa messenger at natawag pa talaga kaso hindi ko pa masagot kasi jet lag pa.
 
(Note that ang place ng friend ko is nagrerent lng siya ng isang room so bali may kasama kami sa apartment which is yan yung boyfriend ko and ang mama niya. So may idea na kayo bakit Lanlord of my Heart pangalan ko? Hahaha lol Pero hindi pa kami that time huh and wala akong idea na lalaki pala ang anak ni Tita basta sinabi lng ng friend ko na 4 kami sa bahay kasama yung anak ni Tita and hindi na ako nagbothered to ask kng babae ba or lalaki. Kasi nga ang main goal ko humanap at mag date ng afam kasi nasa Canada na nga ako kaya chance ko na magka afam 😂)

Pagdating ko sa place nila hindi agad kmi nakapag meet ni boyfie ko na tuh kasi nasa kwarto lng siya parati kasi sobrang mahiyain niya very nonchalant siya. Yung routine niya is work, bahay, games, shower, eat as in yun lng talaga hindi yan lalabas ng kwarto kng hindi kakin or kukuha ng tubig or mag shower. Mag cocross lng landas namin yan sa hallway or sa dining area tas mag hi lng tas wala na haha. 

So ito na first weekend ko sa Canada, and before pako lumipad pa Canada may dating app na ako na giangamit si Bumble 😂 so marami na akong kausap duon and naka scheduled na ang mga ka date ko hahaha (diba ang landi) pero ang date ko day lng walang night kasi nakakatakot haha and parati ko nishashare yung details ng ka date ko sa friend ko pati yung location ko. Tapos alam mo ano nakakatuwa? Naging close kami kaagad ni Tita and siya nag volunteer na ihatid ako sa Square1 (mall) para duon e meet up ang ka date ko haha si Tita din nag suggest na dyan nalang para public ba and safe haha ngayon sumabay pa samin si boyfie ko na tu kasi may work siya nagpapadrop off sa train station. So on the way na kami nag aya pa mag coffee pero sabi ko ayaw kasi nga kbado ako sa ka date ko. After namin siya ma dropped off dumeretso na kami sa Square1 pagdating pumasok muna kami sa Forever21 kasi nga nahihiya pa ako so sabi ni Tita siya muna ang lookout ko hahaha diba very supportive ang mommy ng jowa ko ngayun sa dating era ko dati hahaha. Pero to cut the story short hindi nag worked out yung first date ko hahaha 

After first date nasundan pa yun ng marami and yun nga aware siya sa mga dating keneme ko every weekend kasi nga si boyfie ko ang pinapasuyo ko mag locked ng door pagaalis na ako tas siya din bubukas pagdating ko hahahaha 

In short, malandi ako from September to November kasi walang tigil ang date at mga ka chat  ko kasi nga ang mga afam dun ang hanap ay sex lng so ayaw ko naman ng ganon so walang nag worked out talaga and lahat ng mga kaganapan ko aware si Tita and si boyfie ko kasi very open naman ako sa kanila about my dating life

Hey there,

I’m a 32-year-old introvert with a not-so-secret wild streak, splitting my time between the cozy corners of Jalandhar and the electric buzz of Delhi on weekends. I might seem reserved at first, but beneath the surface, I’m all about cheeky banter, spontaneous adventures, and making memories that leave us both smiling long after the night ends.

I believe in the magic of a lingering glance, the thrill of inside jokes, and the art of making a woman feel truly desired. Whether it’s a flirty compliment whispered over coffee or a slow, meaningful conversation under the stars, I know how to make you feel like you’re the only woman in the room.

My ideal partner? Someone who’s as comfortable getting lost in deep, late-night talks as she is sneaking away for a weekend escape. I adore a woman who can match my wit, challenge my ideas, and isn’t afraid to let her playful side show.

When I’m not exploring new places (or new pleasures), you’ll find me curled up with a novel, binging Netflix, or planning my next little adventure, always leaving room for a partner-in-crime to join me.

If you’re craving connection, laughter, and maybe a little bit of mischief, send me a message. Let’s see if we can turn sparks into something unforgettable.

I’m having trouble finding information online and would love your personal experiences! 

Is there canoe and kayak rental at Ottawa Lake or Whitewater Lake? Do both of these lakes have sandy beaches for kids to play? Do they sell hot meals and/or coffee? Do you recommend one of these lakes over the others? Does the parking lot fill up if you dont get there early? (Like Devil’s Lake)

What are your favorite most scenic trails? (Looking for lots of tree shade so forested would be ideal) Can we bring our bikes to bike there? Which trails are best forr biking? 

Is there a camp store with firewood and ice? We are staying at Pinewoods Campground. 

Favorite restaurants and coffee shops outside the park in the general area?

**The History:** 3 years total - 2 years Copenhagen mint long cut, then 12 months of Zyn. At the end, there was literally a Zyn in my mouth for every scenario: working, coffee, good feelings, bad feelings, you name it. I was obsessed with timing the next one, constantly planning around it.

**The Lie I Finally Saw Through:** I kept telling myself ""I just need 2 a day"" or ""this helps my productivity"" or ""it's just for stress management."" The reality? I was getting maybe 40 minutes of feeling ""locked in,"" followed by HOURS of feeling drained, weak, almost sickly. My body was literally gagging and rejecting it, but I'd override those signals. The math was insane - trading hours of feeling like shit for minutes of artificial focus.

**The Withdraw (Days 1-3):** Not gonna lie, it sucked. Day 1 had weird skin sensations and jaw twitching. Day 2 was the absolute worst - extreme restlessness, couldn't figure out where to stand, jaw twitching so bad I felt like I looked like a crackhead. Day 3 was the turning point - woke up feeling significantly better, and the active craving shifted to just passive memory.

**Then Everything Changed:**

By day 6, something clicked. All that mental bandwidth I was using for nicotine logistics suddenly became available for actual thinking. My productivity didn't just improve - it became explosive. I started completing things immediately instead of procrastinating. Work projects that felt overwhelming suddenly felt manageable.

The relationships hit different too. Instead of defaulting to TV and phone with my family, I was actually present - playing games, engaging, being the partner and father I wanted to be. Professionally, I felt sharp and in control for the first time in years.

**The Morning Transformation:** This might sound small, but my morning routine went from a confusing buzz rush with terrible taste and a crash 40 minutes later, to genuinely enjoying my coffee and having consistent energy. Those clean wake-ups became something I looked forward to.

**The Work Context:** I should mention - I work as head of data and AI, so my days are intense with long hours, lots of shifting priorities and constant context switching. I thought Zyn was helping me handle that cognitive load, but it was actually making the crashes between ""focus sessions"" way worse.

**Documentation Helped:** One thing that really assisted me was documenting everything in detail - withdrawal feelings, brain chemistry changes, mood shifts, the whole timeline. I used Claude AI to help organize my thoughts and observations. Having that data helped me see patterns and stay objective about what was actually happening vs. what the addiction voice was telling me.

**The Addiction Demon:** Here's the weird part - I could literally hear another voice in my brain trying to negotiate and rationalize using again. ""Just one won't hurt,"" ""you deserve this,"" ""it will help with this stressful situation."" But the clarity and genuine enjoyment of life was so much stronger that it drowned out that demon voice.

**Key Insight:** I wasn't giving up something good - I was rejecting something that was actively making my life worse. Once I saw that clearly, everything shifted.

Looking forward to connecting with others on this journey. The freedom is real, and it's so much better than anything that little pouch ever gave me.",5,1752420875.0,QuittingZyn,7,1.0,False

I had feedback on rethinking my genre (previously marked as contemporary magical realism), so hope contemporary fantasy is a better fit. All critique is welcome! [Here's the link to my first post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PubTips/comments/1lteyr6/comment/n1x55v9/?context=3)

Dear \[Agent\],

I’m excited to share my contemporary fantasy novel, *Cafe,* with you, complete at 98,000 words.

Following a traumatic divorce, Fred *Something* continually avoids his shadow—a subconscious voice. Like any troubled soul, he’ll do anything to cover up his inner silence: music, video games, doom scrolling, drinking, even extended conversations with his speaking dog.

While distracting himself with a coffee in an East Village cafe, Fred meets a nameless man who, as it turns out, knows how to see and manipulate the shapes of shadows. Seeing Fred’s mangled shape, he takes advantage, offering to replace Fred’s shadow, and in return receive some of Fred’s physicality. Unconvinced anything can help him face himself, his past, and his growing nihilism, Fred accepts the deal based on the charismatic nature of the stranger.

What Fred didn’t realize is that the cafe itself is a gateway between the physical world and a hidden one, not really here nor there, while the stranger was a prisoner yearning to escape the separate reality. Before Fred finds out that the stranger is not only replacing his shadow, but pushing him out of his body entirely as a means to exist in the physical world, he begins experiencing sporadic hallucinations of a place where he can see and touch shadows. While the hallucinations become more frequent and intense, Fred finds it harder to ground himself in his own body. Music becomes irritating; screens start to leave imprints; he begins sleepwalking.

As the nameless man gnaws away at Fred’s psyche, Fred keeps trying to live a normal life of a thirty year old—enjoying happy hours, chasing women, even tripping on psychedelic lasagna with new friends—but he can’t ignore the slope his mind is falling down. Only his little dog, Leopold, is working to restore their lives. Fred must decide if his shadow was ever something he could run from, or if we all eventually must confront the deep voices inside our heads.

*Cafe* is a meditation on the subconscious, the hidden realities that underlie the everyday, and the modern struggle of identity. It is an unpredictable fever dream that will appeal to the fans of both Gareth Brown’s *The Book of Doors* and its capacity of unravelling secrets, while depicting the mysterious city mood of Haruki Murakami’s *The City and its Uncertain Walls.*

I am a first time author who works as an IT Administrator by day, and, like Fred Something, continually works on my own relationship with my shadow.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Whether you're cueing up for a game on your pool table or designing the perfect reading nook, lighting is everything. Think of the right table lamp as the cherry on top of your interior design—it's what turns spaces into cozy retreats or stylish sanctuaries. Today, we're diving deep into the world of table lamps, unraveling the secrets to choosing the right one to fit your space perfectly. Looking for the best deals on table lamps? Check them out here: [https://topreviews.news/table-lamps](https://topreviews.news/table-lamps).

**Understanding the Basics: Function First**

Before delving into design, let's talk about function. Are you using the lamp for task lighting, ambient lighting, or as an accent piece? The role your table lamp plays is crucial. Task lighting is ideal for focused activities like reading or game nights around the pool table. Meanwhile, ambient lighting creates a warm, inviting atmosphere in living areas. Finally, accent lighting highlights specific features of your room, like an art piece or a stunning piece of furniture.

If you’re looking to upstyle your pool room, a statement pool table lamp does more than just light up the surface. It sets the mood, providing the perfect balance of illumination and ambiance. This lamp? It doesn’t just light up the room—it owns it. Looking for the best deals on table lamps? Check them out here: [https://topreviews.news/table-lamps](https://topreviews.news/table-lamps).

**The Aesthetics: Finding Your Style**

Now that you've nailed down the function, it’s time to marry it with style. Whether you’re rocking a vintage vibe, a minimalist motif, or a bohemian escape, there's a table lamp out there for you. If your space is reminiscent of a hotel suite with a hint of backyard charm, opt for sleek designs with metallic finishes for a luxurious touch. Love the warmth of Sunday morning coffee? A rustic design with a warm glow will do just fine.

When choosing a pool table lamp, consider one that complements the table's color and design. Lighting fixtures are like the ties of home décor—they might seem small, but they complete the ensemble.

**Let’s Talk Size: The Lamp Size Guide**

Size matters—in lighting, that is. Picking a lamp too large can overwhelm the space, whereas a lamp too small might go unnoticed. For table lamps next to sofas or chairs, aim for a height that places the lampshade at eye level when seated. This not only offers comfortable lighting but also prevents glare. For pool tables, you’ll need something grand enough to cast ample light without hanging too low as to interfere with your game.

Remember, the lamp should be a part of your room—not an intrusion or an afterthought. Measure your spaces, take note of heights and widths, and select the lamp size that complements, not detracts from, your interior. Looking for the best deals on table lamps? Check them out here: [https://topreviews.news/table-lamps](https://topreviews.news/table-lamps).

**Light Temperature and Bulbs: The Unsung Heroes**

While the lamp structure is often the star, don't overlook the importance of light temperature and bulbs. Soft white bulbs (2700K–3000K) are perfect for bedrooms and living rooms, offering a cozy and inviting glow. Daylight bulbs (5000K–6500K) are better suited to areas needing focus and clarity, like home offices or above the pool table.

Choosing the right bulb can dramatically alter the vibe shift in your room. Aim for LED bulbs for energy efficiency without compromising on brightness and effect. A well-chosen bulb complements the design and purpose of your space seamlessly. Looking for the best deals on table lamps? Check them out here: [https://topreviews.news/table-lamps](https://topreviews.news/table-lamps).

**Layered and Decorative Lighting: Sophistication Meets Practicality**

Highlighting your prized possessions without overpowering them begins with layered lighting. Using a combination of table lamps, floor lamps, and ceiling fixtures can add depth and dimension to your room. Imagine the suave pool table lamp providing the focal point while softer, decorative lighting creates background ambiance. It’s a design cheat code, layering different sources to achieve the perfect harmony of brightness and warmth.

Think of lighting as storytelling, where each lamp and fixture adds a chapter to your home’s design narrative. With the right mix, your space transforms from mere functional to utterly inspirational.

**Conclusion: Choose with Intention**

In the end, the perfect table lamp is the one that complements your space’s purpose and aesthetic. Don’t just shop for what's trending; think about how a lamp can change how your space feels. Lighting isn’t just décor—it’s emotion. Select it with the same care as you would a piece of art or a comfortable armchair.

Be it illuminating a strategic pool play or setting up your bedside retreat, let the lamp radiate your style and practicality with every flick of the switch. After all, the right lamp isn't just about light—it's about making spaces you love. Looking for the best deals on table lamps?

I have a fixed meal I've been eating for years. It's a 'concoction' with homemade probiotic yoghurt as its base. I add many more things on top of it like fruits, raw cocoa and powders (maca, spirulina, etc). I guess it's a kind of smoothie. The problem is I end up eating 400-500 grams of yoghurt per day, and on top of that, I also always have a daily coffee (with milk, trying to switch to straight espresso but it won't do the trick). I want to replace the yoghurt with something as my blood samples show high amounts of fat (good and bad, I also consume a lot of olive oil) and I'm only 34. Any Ideas ?

# Chapter 1: A girl was born or was she? Wait?

Solene was born in the corridor of Alexandra Hospital, just before sunrise on a March morning in 1984. The sky outside was the colour of wet concrete, heavy and low, like it was waiting for something to give. Inside, the fluorescent lights buzzed faintly overhead—dim, exhausted things that made everything look a little too pale.

There were no delivery rooms left. Her mother was left on a metal gurney, half-shielded by a fraying curtain. A stack of unopened case notes sat by her side, forgotten. The air smelled like rust, antiseptic, and something older—something tired.

She bit down on her wrist to stop herself from screaming. Not out of stoicism, but because it felt like no one would hear her anyway.

A single nurse crouched at the foot of the gurney, gloved hands ready, but distracted. Her watch strap was broken. Her eyes were somewhere else. When the baby came, it happened fast and without ceremony.

There was no cheer, no camera flash, no announcement of gender or weight.Just a single, sharp cry—short, startled—and then silence.

The nurse frowned, as if something was missing, but couldn’t name what. She wrapped the child in a scratchy white towel and handed her over without comment.

They named her Solene—a name her mother had liked once. French, she said. Light. Feminine. It rhymed with her Chinese name Shuling. Something about the lilt of it felt soft enough to hold, like water over stones.

No one could remember where she had first heard it.

The birth records were filled in as quickly as the nurse could manage—there were six more deliveries that morning. Solene’s footprint smudged as she pressed it onto the certificate. The ink never quite dried. Hours later, someone noticed the mother's name had been left blank. The form was refiled without anyone bothering to fix it.

That night, in their Queenstown flat, Solene’s mother stared at her daughter for a long time. The baby’s face was pale and oddly luminous, like a reflection in water. Her tiny fingers curled around nothing.

“Did… I fall asleep?” her mother asked, blinking slowly. “When did she come?”

Her husband looked up from the television but didn’t reply. The broadcast was glitching. The audio drifted in and out as a Channel 5 newscaster stammered through headlines no one would remember.

Solene did not wail much as a baby. She didn’t cling or fuss or demand. She was the kind of infant neighbours politely forgot to ask about. When relatives visited, they would coo at the framed photo of her older brother on the shelf, ask about his schooling, and then hesitate as their eyes brushed over the baby cot tucked in the corner of the room.

“Ah, you haven’t gotten around to having a second one yet?” one aunt commented once, gesturing to the empty crib.

Her mother looked up, startled. “She’s—she’s right there.”

The aunt squinted. “Oh. I didn’t see.”

By the time Solene was three, she had stopped trying to hold anyone’s hand.

She wandered the void deck alone most afternoons, barefoot, holding a yellow balloon she had found tied to a mailbox. The other children didn’t tease her. They didn’t speak to her at all. Sometimes they played tag around her body like she was a pillar or a chair, an object to dodge, not a person to notice.

One day, a boy waved at her. Solene’s heart leapt. She waved back.

And then the balloon slipped from her grasp.

A gust of wind caught it, sending it spinning upwards toward the corridors. The children squealed and chased after it, laughter echoing against concrete. The boy ran too. When the balloon snagged on a tree branch, they all stared for a while, then resumed their game. No one looked back at her.

Solene stood there, one hand still raised.

*I was born like everyone else, but the world never quite made space for me. People remembered the room. The day. The rain. But not the girl.*

*Not the girl at all.*

**Chapter 2: Disappearing?**

On the morning of her first day of Primary 1, the sky opened like it had been holding its breath all night. It was not the soft, apologetic drizzle Singapore was used to, but a sharp, unrelenting downpour that made trees bow and drains overflow. The clouds hung low and swollen, a thick slab of grey that swallowed the sun.

Solene tripped in the field before even reaching the school building. Her new bata school shoes, still stiff from the box, slipped in the mud as she tried to run with the other children toward the assembly area. She fell face-first into a puddle, her hands too slow to catch her, her name tag half-torn by the impact.

No one stopped to help.

She sat through the entire first day cold and wet, her pinafore streaked with dirt, mud crusting behind her ears. Her hair clung to her face in sticky strands. Her knees were grazed and starting to sting.

She thought, *Surely someone would notice.*

But no one did.

Her form teacher didn’t ask why she was filthy. The girl beside her didn’t turn her head once. Even during recess, when other students whispered about “the muddy girl,” they spoke as if she was somewhere else. As if the incident had happened to someone nearby, not someone still sitting there, shivering.

When she got home, her mother opened the front door with a towel in one hand and a frown already on her face.

“Why are you like that?” “I fell…” “In the drain again? You always so careless.”

“I told you, I fell in the school field.”

Her mother blinked, then turned away.

“I don’t remember you telling me.”

That was the first time Solene noticed it.

Not just the forgetting in school, but the *glitches* at home. Small moments where her presence seemed to *skip*. Like a scratched disc. Like something failing to load.

Once, she came home to find dinner laid out with three bowls—one for her mother, one for her father, one for her brother. None for her. Her mother stared at the table and muttered, “I thought I made one more.” Then shook her head. “Never mind.”

Another time, she overheard her father on the phone with an old friend.

“One daughter?” the man on the line must have asked.

“No, lah,” her father replied. “Only one son.”

Solene stood in the hallway, barefoot, her Math worksheet still in hand. She waited for a correction. There was none.

By the end of her first month in school, Solene knew better than to draw attention to herself. She was never picked for group projects. Her spelling tests were returned blank, or not at all. The teacher sometimes marked her “absent” even though she had answered roll call. When she tried to explain, her voice sounded to her own ears like it was coming from underwater.

The others didn’t tease her. They didn’t even look at her long enough to form an opinion.

One day, a cleaner found her sweater in the girls’ toilet and turned it into the office. The admin auntie made an announcement over the PA system, calling out the name tag:

“Chua… So-leen? Solin? Please collect your item at the general office.”

Solene walked up, still damp from the rain. The auntie frowned at her.

“Eh, I already called this name. Are you taking for your friend?”

“No, I’m Solene.”

“You are?” A beat passed. “Oh… okay lor.”

She handed the sweater over like it was a mistake.

That night, her mother knelt in front of the washing machine, pulling out socks and uniforms.

“You didn’t bring back your jacket,” she said. “It wasn’t in your bag.”

“Yes I did. I collected it today.”

Her mother stared into the empty washing drum, like it held the answer.

“Really?” She looked up slowly. “I don’t remember you coming home.”

Solene stood still for a long time, her shoes still on, the damp sweater hanging off one arm. She said nothing. The moment passed.

And just like that, it was gone.

That was the first time Solene noticed it.

Not just the forgetting in school, but the *glitches* at home. Small moments where her presence seemed to *skip*. Like a scratched disc. Like something failing to load.

Once, she came home to find dinner laid out with three bowls—one for her mother, one for her father, one for her brother. None for her. Her mother stared at the table and muttered, “I thought I made one more.” Then shook her head. “Never mind.”

Another time, she overheard her father on the phone with an old friend.

“One daughter?” the man on the line must have asked.

“No, lah,” her father replied. “Only one son.”

Solene stood in the hallway, barefoot, her Science worksheet still in hand. She waited for a correction. There was none.

By the end of her first month in school, Solene knew better than to draw attention to herself. She was never picked for group projects. Her spelling tests were returned blank, or not at all. The teacher sometimes marked her “absent” even though she had answered roll call. When she tried to explain, her voice sounded to her own ears like it was coming from underwater.

The others didn’t tease her. They didn’t even look at her long enough to form an opinion.

The ache sharpened when she met Min Jing.

Min Jing was everything Solene was not—whip sharp, loud but not arrogant, beloved by teachers. She wore her prefect badge like a medal with her whip like pony tail bouncing as she walks the school hall. She sat in the front row and always had extra foolscap paper. One day, in Primary 4, she noticed Solene sitting on the canteen steps, untouched food on her tray.

“Eh, you don’t like chicken rice, ah?” Min Jing asked.

Solene blinked. Someone was talking to her.

“I—I do.”

Min Jing plopped down beside her without ceremony. “Then eat lah.”

Solene’s heart beat too fast. She nodded and took a bite.

From then on, Min Jing made a habit of saying hi in the hallways. Sharing sweets. Once, she invited Solene to her house to study for a science test. Solene walked home floating.

She began to feel the outlines of herself again. Her laugh came easier. She even began writing notes in class to Min Jing—stupid jokes, silly doodles. Min Jing replied with stickers and smiley faces. It was the closest thing to friendship Solene had ever tasted. Maybe even love. She didn’t have a word for the feeling, only that she wanted it to stay. She wanted to be seen—*and remembered*—just a little longer.

But it didn’t.

After the March holidays, Min Jing never called. Never waved. When Solene walked by her table at recess, she was greeted with blankness.

She tried saying hi. Tried bumping into her “by accident.” But Min Jing looked through her like she was fogged glass.

The notes, the study sessions, the laughter—gone. Wiped.

It wasn’t Min Jing’s fault. It never was. Solene could see the confusion flicker across her eyes, like a forgotten dream just at the edge of waking.

She stopped trying.

At home, things weren’t better.

Her mother had grown colder over the years—not cruel, just tired. Her gaze rarely settled on Solene for long. It slid past her, like she was a misplaced thought.

But the expectations remained. Solene was still a daughter in a Chinese household, and that meant she had to help with chores, make way for her brother, speak less, and be less.

When her brother left his plate on the table, her mother called her to wash it. When relatives visited, Solene was told to pour tea, smile politely, and not interrupt adult talk. Her brother was praised for ""being a boy who doesn’t talk too much.” Solene was sometimes chided for being “too quiet.”

She was twelve when her cousin knocked over a porcelain bowl at Chinese New Year, and the adults looked straight at Solene.

""Why didn’t you stop her?""

""I—I wasn’t even—""

""Don’t talk back. Girls should learn to keep the peace.""

That night, she overheard her mother muttering to her aunt in the kitchen:

“Girls like that, if not careful, later become like ghosts. Just float around, no husband, no ambition.”

Solene stared at her own reflection in the window, wondering if maybe she already was.

*I was never too loud, too wild, too stubborn.* *I was obedient. I was careful. I was small.*

*And still, it wasn’t enough to be loved.* *It wasn’t even enough to be seen.*

# Chapter 3: The Vanishing Point

At sixteen, Solene finished her O Levels with unremarkable results.

Not terrible. Not stellar. The sort of grades that quietly narrowed futures, less JC, more poly, fewer choices, fewer second chances. The kind that would warrant a gentle scolding or a half-hearted ""can do better next time"" from a typical parent.

But no one said anything to her.

Her name wasn’t read out at the results ceremony in the school hall. She stood at the side, watching as students were called up in index order, hands clasped, trying not to look anxious. Her number came and went.

No one noticed.

She had to walk up to the teachers’ table at the end of the programme and ask if they had forgotten her.

Her form teacher gave her a puzzled look.""You’re from this cohort?""

""I’m from 4E2.""

The teacher hesitated, then pulled out a plastic file and flipped through a stack of brown envelopes. One was handed to her without apology.

""Oh... must have missed you out.""

Solene walked to the void deck, tore open the envelope, and stared at the numbers inside. She felt nothing. Just a blankness, like looking at a stranger’s horoscope.

She stayed there until the street lamps flickered on.

When she returned home, no one asked how she had done.

Her mother was watching *Under One Roof*, peeling garlic at the coffee table with the TV volume turned up too loud. Her father was in the room napping before dinner. Her brother was on the landline with a friend, twirling the coiled phone cord around his wrist.

Solene stood by the door for a moment, holding the envelope in both hands.

""I got my results today.""

""Hmm?"" her mother said, not looking up.

""I said I got back my results.""

A pause.""I thought that was next week?""

""I told you. I wrote it on the calendar.""

Her mother frowned and turned toward the kitchen. ""I didn’t see anything.""

Later that night, the page for November was checked—neatly marked with her brother’s piano grading, her father’s work trip, and a scribble for ""grocery with Ah Ma.""Nothing about Solene.

There was no school to return to. The weeks after the results ceremony hung shapeless and slow. Teenagers across Singapore were in limbo—shopping for polytechnic brochures, waiting for course placements, weighing options. Solene was no different, except that no one seemed to ask her what she planned to do.

She had circled a few courses in visual communications and fine arts, mostly out of instinct. Something about making images appealed to her. The idea that she could put herself somewhere visible, somewhere permanent.

But the forms sat untouched in her room. No one chased her for deadlines. No one reminded her. Her name never seemed to appear on the application shortlists.

It wasn’t the first time her existence slipped.

There was the time she returned home from a school excursion to discover the gate locked, lights out. She had to wait two hours outside while mosquitoes bit her ankles.When her parents returned from dinner with her aunt, her mother had said, confused,""You never told us you were out.""

""I was at the Bird Park the whole day.""

""No, you weren’t.""

Another time, she opened her report book to show her mid-year results—five subjects passed, two borderline.

Her father flipped through the pages and frowned.""This is blank.""

She blinked. ""What?""

""Nothing’s inside.""

She grabbed it back. The pages were empty. Crisp. Untouched.

""I swear it was filled in.""

Her father folded it shut. ""Maybe you dreamt it.""

At home, the forgetting grew bolder.

She would find her clothes folded into plastic bags to be donated, as if no one remembered they belonged to someone still living there. Her toothbrush replaced. Her towel missing.

During Chinese New Year, her name was left out of the red packet tally scrawled in her mother’s ledger book. Even her Ah Ma, who used to ask if she was eating enough, forgot to greet her.

At a cousin’s birthday dinner, a relative asked her mother how many children she had.

""Just one son,"" her mother replied casually.

Solene stood there, holding a packet of Yeo’s chrysanthemum tea, wondering if she should correct her.

She didn’t.

She began skipping tuition. No one noticed. She stopped asking for pocket money and started saving up her change. She bought a notebook from Popular bookstore with a floral cover and started writing her name over and over again inside.

She told herself that if it ever disappeared, she would know for sure.

One morning, she flipped to the last page. All blank.

One afternoon, she went to the living room and took out the family photo albums.There was one from their trip to Malacca. She remembered riding a trishaw and getting bitten by ants during breakfast. Her brother had cried at the night market.

There were photos of the trip.Her mother holding a sugarcane drink.Her father in front of the red temple.Her brother sulking next to a plastic stool.

Solene was not in any of the photos.

Not even a glimpse. Not a shadow. Not a blurred figure in the background.

In one photo, someone had scribbled on the back in blue ballpoint pen: ""Mum, Dad, Ah Xin\* at Jonker Walk."" \*Ah Xin is Solene's older brother

She stopped telling people her [name.It](http://name.It) didn’t stick anyway.

Teachers had called her ""girl"" or ""eh you.""Classmates had once referred to her as ""the quiet one with the ponytail,"" if they remembered her at all.

Now there was no one left to call her anything at all.

*I used to think I was just shy.Then I thought I was just unlikeable.Then I thought maybe I was a punishment.*

*Now I’m not sure I was ever fully real.Just a placeholder. A shadow. A thing shaped like a person that forgot how to stay solid.*

In her dreams, the world was a corridor that never ended.She ran past classrooms where no one looked up. Past her own home, which flickered like static. Past mirrors that showed no reflection. Past versions of herself sitting at desks she had never seen, with mouths moving but no sound.

Sometimes, she saw a version of herself walking in the other direction—calmer, smiling, hand in someone else’s. But when she turned to follow, the corridor folded in on itself.

And she woke up with a name on her tongue she didn’t recognise.

That morning, she didn’t go out.

She sat by the window with her legs tucked beneath her, watching as the sky shifted from grey to greyer. A Myojo cup noodle grew cold on the table beside her, untouched.

She tried writing her name on the condensation of the glass.

**Solene.**

It faded before the water even dried.

The shoebox under her bed was nearly empty now. Half the Polaroids had vanished. Her collection of ticket stubs from the movies were gone. Her handwriting in the notebooks grew lighter every day, as though ink itself no longer believed in her.

But then came the glitch.

One night, she stood at the corridor light switch, flicking it on and off. She had done it a thousand times before. But this time, the bulb hesitated.

The delay wasn’t electrical. It was *temporal*.The light didn’t flicker. It *stuttered*. Like a VHS tape paused too long.For a split second, she saw two versions of her own hand—one moving, one still.

And then, it was gone.

The next day, she waved her hand in front of the glass cabinet in the community centre.

The reflection didn’t wave back.

She stopped speaking for a week. No one noticed.

But strange things began to happen. She would mutter her name under her breath, and the wall clock would lag by a tick. A pencil would roll uphill slightly on her desk. A shadow would linger longer than it should have before fading.

She didn’t know what it meant. But it was happening around her.

*With her.*

*Because of* ***her****.*

It wasn’t confusion anymore. It wasn’t neglect. It wasn’t some cruel coincidence.

It was **a pattern**. A rhythm. A mechanism.

She wasn’t just being overlooked. She was *moving differently* through the world. Slipping past attention, past notice, past memory, like a thread being pulled out of a tapestry from the inside.

*What if this wasn’t happening to me? What if I was doing it? Not all the time. Not consciously. But enough.*

*Enough to know I had never just been left out. I had just been erasing myself all along.*

I've been trying to improve my Quranic Arabic recently, and here's the approach I'm taking:

1. I'm focusing on memorizing the most frequently used words in the Quran — the ones that keep showing up in almost every surah.
2. For grammar and sentence-building practice, I’ve been using this Android app called *Qurania* — it lets me do little roleplays like introducing myself, ordering coffee, or answering simple questions (like Duolingo). 

Does this sound like a solid plan? I’m aiming to both understand the Quran directly and also feel more comfortable forming sentences.

I wanted to reach out and see if anyone here has real experience with building (or at least maintaining) muscle on a pretty intense fasting schedule.

A bit about me:

Recently I’ve been doing **5:2 fasting,** meaning **5 days of full fasting (just water, electrolytes, black coffee), and 2 days of eating** on the weekend. 

I started this about a month ago after hitting a breaking point with my weight and mindset. It’s been transformational so far. I’ve lost around **14kg already**, dropped my waistline noticeably, and for the first time in years I feel like I’m truly in control.

Started 115 Kg, now I am 100. Seeing the double digits I haven't seen in forever...

But now I’m starting to think about **muscle**. I do resistance training twice a week, one mid-fasting (tuesday) and the other on Friday, before eating.

I’d love to hear from anyone who’s tried something similar.

* Did you actually build muscle, or mostly preserve it?
* Did you notice strength drops, or did you hold on okay?
* Any lessons on timing workouts, upping protein, or tweaking the approach to make it less catabolic?

For me, getting lean is priority #1, but long term I want to start putting on muscle again. Just trying to learn from others who’ve walked this weird path before.

The two guys prodded Kalvin through the door with their guns — both bald, both built like washed-up wrestlers. One had a gut. The other looked like a tan Mr. Clean, burn scars rippling down one side of his face.

 

The door opened into a garage with two cars up on lifts. The floor was so greasy it nearly reflected the ceiling. The stench of burnt rubber and gasoline hung thick in the air. Strong enough to sting his eyes.

 

But it wasn’t the smell or the guns that bothered Kalvin.

Wasn’t the stink of the two meatheads breathing down his neck.

Wasn’t even the thought of getting shot.

 

It was Darren.

 

If he didn’t make it home, Darren would never know why.

What if he thinks you left him?

It felt like someone was dragging barbed wire through his gut — slow and deliberate.

 

A calm man in a tan suit stood smoking, jacket draped over one shoulder. Black hair slicked back, streaked with gray like creeping frost. One eye was glazed over; the other studied Kalvin.

 

“So, this the guy who killed our two men up there?” he asked, like he was ordering coffee.

 His voice was calm, but carried the roughness of an untraveled dirt road.
like something dark was buried beneath it,
just deep enough to stay hidden.

“So,” he said, smoke curling from his nostrils, “this the guy who killed our men?”


The men behind Kalvin nodded. Mr. Clean said, deep-voiced, “Yes, sir.”

 

Smoke leaked from the man’s nose and mouth. “You know what I do?”

 

Kalvin didn’t flinch. “You tell people what to do. That’s what you do.”

 

The man smirked. “The only acceptable answer.”

 

He flicked his cigarette to the floor and crushed it under his heel.

“But it’s more than that. I test people. Because in my world, life isn’t given — it’s earned.”

 

“Fair enough,” Kalvin said evenly. Dangerous man  no doubt, he thought.

Still, he could use a fire safety course.

 

The man started blowing on his nails — pink and blue polish splashed across the tips. He inspected them like they were some new species.

 

“You know what it feels like to have someone rely on you?” he asked.
He caught Kalvin staring and laughed.


“My daughter. She loves giving me makeovers. But you know what I love about it? People can stare all they want — but they can’t say shit. You know why?”


“Why?” Kalvin asked, like he was curious.

He was.

 
Mr. Clean nudged him forward. Kalvin caught a whiff of the man’s aftershave.

 
“Because they rely on me. And the last guy who said anything?” He smirked. “Ended up in the Gulf. And he wasn’t sailing.”

 

He took a long drag from his cigarette, eyes locked on Kalvin.

 
“But that’s the point. Reliability. That’s what people want. That’s what I want.”

 

He stepped in close. Smoke drifted between them.

 

“So tell me, Kalvin Montgomery… are you reliable?”

 

A pause.

 

“Or at least more reliable than the two guys you took out so easily?”

 

For the first time in his adult life, Kalvin felt uncomfortable.

And in the back of his mind, he quietly congratulated the man for it.

1lyvef6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lyvef6,Raised bike lanes? (Reposted because of typos),"Jittery coffee hands and a tiny phone screen got me once again.. anyways

Seeing as bike lane safety has become a hot topic once again, I was wondering if anyone had any opinions particularly on the ergonomics of a raised bike lane instead of a protected bike lane?

I am a cyclist and survivor of two vehicle collisions in the city. I am also an architectural design student with special interest in the public built environment and urban planning.

I historically have been in full support of better bike lane protections; both times I was hit were in non-protected bikes lanes. Although the idea of concrete barriers is a sure way to increase safety for cyclists, I do understand the posed risk it has in preventing things like ambulances to pass traffic and other things of the such. I had this idea today, and a quick google search resulted in confirming that this idea has been considered for practice.

If bike lanes were raised lanes of about 2-4 inches, with maybe rumble strips and flex posts bordering them, do you think that it would be safer than the options we have now? I can imagine the elevation and sensation would act as a physical reminder to encourage drivers to pay attention to the bike lane that they are crossing over. It would also allow for emergency vehicles to pass traffic in compromising situations. Does the community have any thoughts on this?

Addressing the topic of intersections, these raised lanes could taper into the intersection by a few feet for added security until the drivers visibility of cyclists is clearer.",18,1752420050.0,phillycycling,12,0.91,False

The 2025 HESI Maternity Assignment Exam loomed like a cranky newborn at 3 a.m., throwing curveballs of labor stages, postpartum care, and neonatal assessments. Tina, armed with her trusty coffee mug and a dream of becoming Babytopia’s next great nurse, knew she needed more than her charm to ace this exam—she needed a plan.

One chaotic afternoon, while dodging a rogue pacifier in Babytopia’s library, Tina tripped over a stack of books and landed face-first in front of Midwife Mabel, the town’s sassiest nursing guru. With a cackle, Mabel handed her a glowing USB drive. “This ain’t no ordinary study guide, kid,” she said, winking. “It’s the Duke University Nursing Maternity HESI Assignment Exam Review from [ExamsHut](https://examshut.com/product/duke-university-nursing-maternity-hesi-assignment-exam-review/?currency=usd). Think of it as your cheat code to outsmart the HESI stork!”

Tina plugged in the USB, and poof—the digital guide burst open like a piñata of knowledge:  


* A Nursery of Practice Questions: Hundreds of NCLEX-style questions on labor complications, fetal monitoring, and postpartum shenanigans—each one a giggle-worthy challenge.
*  Rationales with Sass: Every answer came with explanations so clear, it was like Mabel herself was whispering, “Girl, don’t mix up lochia with latte!”
*  2025-Aligned Shenanigans: Perfectly tuned to the latest HESI Maternity blueprint, covering everything from Apgar scores to breastfeeding tips.
*  High-Yield Diaper Bag: Stuffed with must-knows like maternal assessments, newborn care, and patient teaching, prepping Tina for the exam and real-world mom-wrangling.
*  Portable Pacifier: A downloadable PDF, ready for study sessions during diaper-changing breaks, coffee runs, or midnight snack raids. 

Tina dove into the guide like a kid into a ball pit. She tackled questions on contractions (not the dance move, sadly), mastered Apgar scoring (easier than rating her last date), and even learned to spot postpartum red flags without breaking a sweat. The rationales were like stand-up comedy routines, making sense of tricky topics with wit sharper than a Babytopia diaper pin. By the end, Tina wasn’t just ready—she was practically ready to deliver a lecture and a baby.

Exam day rolled in like a runaway stroller. Tina strutted into the testing center, her confidence higher than a new mom’s caffeine levels. The HESI threw its best punches—fetal heart rates, preeclampsia protocols, newborn reflexes—but Tina dodged and weaved like a pro. When her score popped up, it was a standing ovation: Tina had aced the exam, ready to join Babytopia’s nursing elite with a grin as wide as a bassinet.

After winging my crappy not-diet for a couple of weeks, I had my breakfast as I usually do. I kind of scarfed it down faster than normal but attributed it to needing to get work done. But then within 5 min of finishing I was *hungry*. And not in the ""I could have a granola bar or something right now"", I'm talking full on starving dog who hasn't eaten in  ~~5 minutes~~ 3 weeks. My body all of a sudden decided that it was sick of me starving it and it needed more food NOW. What I thought were actions far behind me came back lightning fast: My head swirled with thoughts of food and eating and before I knew it, I was in and out of my pantry, having a little of this and a little of that, until it snowballed into me burning through boxes of protein bars and fiber brownies and whatever else.

When I was finally too physically full to eat more, I sat there like a lead balloon. I felt immense shame and guilt and horror and wondered why the medicine stopped working on my dang food noise. A little voice in the background screamed ""it's because you neglected yourself!"" but I couldn't hear it over the sound of me having to run to the bathroom and experience what happens when you mix 1000g of protein and fiber in one go.

I call it the [Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_and_the_Terrible,_Horrible,_No_Good,_Very_Bad_Day). That was a few days ago and I still have intermittent heartburn. I also think I am still relieving myself of some of those fiber brownies.

Lesson learned - *eat enough food to fuel your body or your body will press the reset button itself.*

If the thought of counting calories triggers diet PTSD, I get it. Set alarms on your phone to eat something nutritionally dense throughout the day. Make a meal plan for yourself. You don't have to know the calories but you should have a general idea that oatmeal with fruit and yogurt is going to be better fuel for the body than having black coffee and a bite of toast. Now the common comments I see...

""But I'm **not hungry**!"" - adjust your dose. This medication should help alleviate obsessive thoughts about food (ex: the food noise, the constantly thinking of eating even when not hungry), not completely wipe out the feeling of hunger. If you don't have any hunger, your dose is too strong.

""But I **don't want to be hungry** \- that's how I got here in the first place!"" - Mmmm okay, yes and no. Did you maybe eat too much? Sure. Was it because you were hungry? That's the disconnect between the brain and the body. You may have felt like you were hungry because you weren't feeling satiated. This medication should help fix that, so when you eat enough your body now knows to say ""okay, I feel fine now!""

""I am scared of hunger because I **don't want to go back to how I was before**"" - if you take one thing away from my story, it's that chronically under-fueling my body instead of actually feeding it appropriately brought back my old bad habits. My body triggered a binge because it was starving. I took my shot this week as usual, adjusted my meal plan to actually eat, and I am feeling satiated. My food noise is quelled as it should be. The medication is working as intended because I am working with it.

I've mostly chipped away at what I do for him. If his laundry isn't sorted, I don't wash it. We have a cleaning service, so he just has to clear his floor of trash and dirty laundry and they will change his sheets and vacuum, but he doesn't do it so he winds up letting his room get stinky into her can't stand it and then begging me to help him change his sheets. I am good about saying ""bud. If I wanted to wrestle duvet covers I wouldn't pay someone else to come do it.""

During the school year, he had such a hard time with school that we agree that going to school every day is his primary responsibility. 

This summer, he's working 20 hours a week and hanging out with his friends the rest of the time and I need to figure out a reset. 

I've started just asking him to do things. He doesn't do them, and I get a bit annoyed, but at least I'm telling him what I want to see. (Mostly yard work).

I'm very aware of it right now because my husband, who does a lot of necessary daily dog and kitchen cleaning chores, is out of town for over a week. So I'm feeling the lack of assistance.

If I ask him to do anything, he throws such a fit about it that I feel like I'm creating a monster. And it works because I don't have any leverage. Monster: created. 

And even though he's working this summer, he's not on track to launch into independence at 18. So I need to figure out a different dynamic. Because I can't keep this going. 

He spits loogies in the bathroom sink and pops his zits in the mirror and I and it revolting. And then if I ask him to clean it up he pitches a whole fit. 

Right now, I'm sitting in the living room with my coffee trying to think about how to approach this. He just asked me to close the bathroom window for him (it's cold with it open, which I don't mind but he does).I got as far as the bathroom mirror and said ""if I cost this window are you going to clean your zits if the mirror?"" And he says ""maybe one day"". So I said, ""I'm thinking I'm not actually your servant"" and went back to the couch leaving the window open. 

Now he's lying in bed moaning that our house is always cold and he's just never getting out of bed. (Our house is teeny tiny so with doors open, this is a conversation we can just have.)

The 2025 HESI Exam loomed on the horizon like a stormy sea, its waves churning with questions on med-surg, pharmacology, maternity, and clinical judgment. Zara, with her dreams of becoming a nurse billowing like sails, knew this voyage required more than courage—she needed a trusty compass to navigate the treacherous tides of NCLEX-style challenges.

One misty dawn, as Zara pored over weathered textbooks in Careport’s lighthouse library, an old sea-healer named Captain Nora handed her a fabled artifact: the Duke University Nursing 2025 HESI Review Exam Questions from [ExamsHut](https://examshut.com/product/duke-university-nursing-hesi-review-exam-questions-2025/?currency=usd). “This,” Nora whispered, “is no ordinary guide—it’s a nautical chart, drawn by Duke’s finest nursing navigators, to steer you through the HESI’s roughest waters.”

* Zara unfurled the digital parchment, and its treasures gleamed like sunken gold: A Fleet of Practice Questions: Hundreds of NCLEX-style questions, spanning fundamentals, pediatrics, psych, and more—each a buoy marking the path to mastery. 
* Lighthouse Rationales: Every answer glowed with detailed explanations, guiding Zara through the fog of wrong choices to the clarity of understanding. 
* 2025-Aligned Currents: Tailored to the latest HESI exam blueprint, with a focus on prioritization, delegation, and real-world nursing scenarios. 
* High-Yield Cargo: Packed with essentials like medication safety, patient education, and care coordination, equipping Zara for both the exam and her healer’s journey. 
* Portable Compass: A downloadable PDF, ready to chart her course during late-night study sessions, clinical breaks, or seaside coffee runs. 

With the guide as her wind, Zara sailed into preparation. Each question was a wave she rode, mastering IV drips, charting pediatric milestones, and steering through ethical dilemmas. The rationales were her North Star, illuminating the logic behind patient assessments and drug interactions. As days turned to weeks, Zara’s confidence swelled like a tide, her fears sinking to the ocean floor.

The day of the HESI dawned bright. Zara strode into the testing harbor, her mind as steady as a seasoned mariner. Questions surged—obstetric emergencies, med-surg protocols, dosage calculations—but Zara navigated with ease. The Duke guide had honed her instincts, and she sailed through each challenge. When her score flashed like a beacon, Zara’s heart sang: she’d conquered the exam with flying colors, her nursing dreams now in full sail.

A short story told to me about a person that had no idea where he was going but ended up doing the works of Our Lord Jesus Christ. He was a soldier in Boot Camp, training to go to war. He was well liked, completed his training passing the unorthodox methods that they used back decades ago to prepare you for an enemy that was worse than their training could ever be.

Upon Graduation Day, everyone got to march proudly in front of all the visitors but him. He was told that you have a ‘Glitch’, in your step when you march and so you can’t be in the parade as it would be detrimental to the other Soldiers and Military Officers who want perfection, when they are under Military Review.

So, this young man didn’t mind as it was for the good of the other soldiers with whom they all shared a comradery! He got to drink coffee in the Mess Hall while this Graduation Parade took place.

During the years after this young man life was saved countless times, he told me that he even remembered being saved from drowning at the age of twelve, when he was all alone dying. Jesus Christ screamed his name in the dark waters of the Thames River, to the child who had frozen in fear, descending in the dark deep waters, seeing only bubbles drifting upward for he knew not how to swim! The name Jesus Called out was “Saul; and Jesus said Saul, close your mouth”, the child obeyed and ascended to the surface to continue in this life!

Saving his life, the lives of his children in the most horrific tragedies that occurred in their lives over the years, he decided to give thanks to God, for all that had been given to him and those he loved!

The moral of this story is the ‘Glitch’ that kept this young man from marching proudly in the Military Graduation Parade, because he wouldn’t look good, opened a new door to where tens of thousands of viewers could now see him clearly through his inspirational writings, those words that can help change the course of their lives to Jesus Christ for spiritual guidance in this physical life that we live and Jesus Christ, the Gate Master to Eternal Life!

Then one day this man who always wanted to be a priest in the Catholic Church, decided to start a Mission. Asking Jesus Christ to guide him in his works, and to guide him in Inspirational Writings. Words of power, inspirational to help, not hinder people to accept, follow, have ‘Faith and Believith’ in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, sent into this world to save it; not to destroy it.

Jesus wanted to let them know that ‘If you want to get to Heaven’, ‘I Am the Way’ I am the Path, the Gateway, **the only ‘Way’** to Heaven and Eternal Life after death of this physical life that we live on earth!

One fateful evening, as Eli studied beneath the glow of Nursalia’s great library, a wise preceptor named Liora gifted him a radiant relic: the Duke University Nursing 2025 HESI Practice Exam Review from [ExamsHut](https://examshut.com/product/duke-university-nursing-hesi-practice-exam-review-2025/?currency=usd). This wasn’t just a study guide—it was a celestial map, crafted with the brilliance of Duke’s nursing scholars, designed to light the way through the HESI’s cosmic trials.

As Eli opened the digital scroll, its wisdom shimmered like starlight:

* A Galaxy of Practice Questions: Hundreds of NCLEX-style challenges, covering fundamentals, maternity, psych, and med-surg—each a beacon to guide his mastery.
* Stellar Rationales: Every answer came with luminous explanations, transforming confusion into clarity and doubts into confidence.
* 2025-Aligned Orbit: Perfectly synced with the latest HESI exam blueprint, emphasizing clinical judgment, delegation, and patient-centered care.
* High-Yield Nebulae: Focused on critical topics like medication safety, therapeutic communication, and care planning, preparing Eli for both the exam and his nursing destiny.
* Portable Starlight: A downloadable PDF, ready to illuminate study sessions between clinical shifts, coffee runs, or quiet nights under the Nursalia sky.

Eli embarked on his odyssey with the guide as his compass. Each practice question was a star he charted, from decoding ABGs to navigating ethical dilemmas. The rationales became his celestial guide, revealing the logic behind patient prioritization and pharmacology pitfalls. Night by night, Eli’s skills sharpened, his fears fading like distant comets, replaced by a radiant confidence.

When the HESI exam dawned, Eli stepped into the testing arena like a navigator of the cosmos. The questions swirled—maternity emergencies, pediatric interventions, med administration—but Eli was undaunted. The Duke guide had mapped every constellation, and he answered with precision. As his score blazed across the screen, Eli felt the universe cheer: he had not only passed but soared, a true HESI champion.

For those who haven’t checked out Deep Pixel Melancholy yet — it’s a visual novel about inner emptiness and the search for meaning. When one bad event follows another endlessly, what does it take to push through and reignite a spark inside?

👱‍♂️ You play as the main character, Egor. His life is like a stuck VHS tape: utility bills, the same trolley bus to the office, endless paperwork, 3-in-1 instant coffee, and chronic exhaustion. He dreams of the sea, but let’s face it, hell will freeze over before he can afford a vacation.

🕑 His routine is shattered when he discovers he’s stuck in a time loop. As he tries to make sense of it, he’s forced to face a deeper question: why bother escaping at all? Tomorrow doesn’t promise anything better, and maybe one carefree day is all he really needs to feel at peace.

This wasn’t just any test—it was a cauldron of questions, bubbling with med-surg mysteries, pharmacology potions, and critical thinking conundrums. Maya, with her scrubs freshly pressed and her dreams of becoming a nurse burning bright, knew she needed more than grit to brew success. She needed magic.

One moonlit night, while scouring the ancient archives of the Nurselandia Library, Maya discovered a fabled relic: the Duke University Nursing 2025 HESI Practice Exam Prep from [ExamsHut](https://examshut.com/product/duke-university-nursing-hesi-practice-exam-prep-2025/?currency=usd). This wasn’t just a study guide—it was an alchemist’s grimoire, infused with the wisdom of Duke’s nursing masters, designed to transform raw ambition into exam-dominating power.

As Maya opened the digital tome, its secrets spilled forth like a potion of knowledge:

* A Cauldron of Practice Questions: Hundreds of NCLEX-style challenges, covering fundamentals, med-surg, maternity, pediatrics, and more—each a spark to ignite her mastery.
* Elixirs of Insight: Detailed rationales for every answer, turning mistakes into lessons and uncertainties into confidence.
* 2025-Aligned Formula: Crafted to match the latest HESI exam blueprint, with a focus on prioritization, delegation, and clinical scenarios that mirror real-world nursing.
* High-Yield Ingredients: Packed with must-know topics like patient safety, therapeutic communication, and dosage calculations, preparing Maya for both the exam and her future as a healer.
* Portable Enchantment: A downloadable PDF, perfect for brewing knowledge on the go—between clinicals, during coffee breaks, or under the glow of a study lamp.

Maya dove into the guide like an alchemist perfecting her craft. She mixed potions of pharmacology, stirred solutions for patient care plans, and distilled complex concepts into clarity. Each practice question was a test of her skill, and the rationales were her mentor, guiding her through the fog of ventilator settings and ethical dilemmas. With every session, Maya’s confidence grew, her fears evaporating like mist in the morning sun.

When the day of the HESI arrived, Maya entered the testing hall like a sorceress wielding her finest spell. The questions came fast—obstetric emergencies, pediatric assessments, med administration—but Maya was ready. The Duke guide had honed her instincts, and she navigated each challenge with precision. As the screen revealed her score, a cheer echoed in her heart: Maya had brewed a masterpiece, earning a stellar pass and a step closer to her RN dreams.

The 2025 HESI PN/RN Exam loomed over him like a stormy cloud, its challenges whispered in hushed tones: complex patient scenarios, critical thinking riddles, and a gauntlet of questions spanning med-surg, maternity, and beyond. Leo dreamed of becoming a nurse, but the path to his RN or PN license felt like scaling a mountain guarded by a dragon named Doubt.

One crisp evening, as Leo pored over scattered notes in the village library, a wise mentor—a seasoned nurse named Clara—slid a glowing artifact across the table. “This,” she said with a knowing smile, “is the Duke University Nursing 2025 HESI Practice Exam for PN/RN from [ExamsHut](https://examshut.com/product/duke-university-nursing-hesi-practice-exam-2025-pn-rn/?currency=usd). It’s your map to victory.”

Leo downloaded the digital scroll from ExamsHut, and as he opened it, a world of power unfolded. This wasn’t just a study guide—it was a legendary grimoire, infused with Duke University’s nursing mastery, crafted to guide warriors like him through the HESI’s treacherous terrain. Its pages revealed:

* A Colossal Vault of Questions: Hundreds of NCLEX-style challenges covering med-surg, pediatrics, maternity, psych, and fundamentals—each a key to unlocking exam success.
* Sage Explanations: Every question came with crystal-clear rationales, turning confusion into clarity and teaching Leo why answers were right or wrong.
* 2025-Aligned Questline: Perfectly tailored to the latest HESI PN/RN exam blueprint, with emphasis on prioritization, delegation, and clinical judgment.
* High-Yield Treasures: Focused on need-to-know topics like patient safety, care plans, and therapeutic communication, preparing Leo for both the exam and real-world nursing.
* Portable Enchantment: A downloadable PDF, ready for study sessions in coffee shops, between clinical shifts, or under the stars.

Leo dove into the guide like a knight training for battle. Each practice question sharpened his skills: he mastered IV flow rates, decoded ABGs, and navigated ethical dilemmas with ease. The rationales became his mentor, guiding him through tricky scenarios like managing a patient with COPD or prioritizing care in a busy ER. Night after night, Doubt’s shadow shrank, replaced by a fire of confidence.

The day of the HESI arrived. Leo entered the testing center, his heart steady as he recalled the guide’s wisdom. Questions flew at him—maternity complications, pediatric milestones, med administration—but Leo was ready. The Duke practice exam had forged him into a master of critical thinking. When the screen flashed his score, the village of Nursington seemed to cheer: Leo had not only passed but soared, a true HESI champion.

1lyuwc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/LordofTheMysteriesRP/comments/1lyuwc9/the_twilight_festival_is_a_fever_dream/,The Twilight Festival is a fever dream,"I don’t think I could have guessed that I would wake up in the morning to a festival having emerged out of nowhere. As I groggily woke up, my sense of time still fuzzy from the infinite loops of the clock worker’s labyrinth, I was hit with a wave of smells leaking through my open window. The cacophonous roars of a dozen different scents, all battling as they wafted through the air, making an overwhelming concoction of oils, spices, and herbs.

Walking over to the open window, I saw the streets lined from end to end with stalls and paper ornaments that seemingly were all set up in one night. No fanfare, no prior advertisement, no gossip. Yet hundreds of people were milling about on the streets as small leaflets fluttered down from the sky. One such poster flew right into my hands, as if directed by the wind itself.

“**The first Twilight Festival has begun!!!**”

There was no explanation. There were no other words. The rest of the page being taken up by entirely hand drawn pictures of explosions in various shapes and angles. I could only scratch my head in confusion.

‘What is going on?’

Pulling on a leather jacket, I stumbled downstairs and out the door, being swallowed into the shuffling crowd in an instant. I was pushed along without even given the time to let out a cry for help. My attempts of asking people to stop were drowned out by the marching of bands blaring out music.

Hastily putting on a thin silver bracelet with blue diamond gems, I blasted off the ground. Flying through the air, I felt a brief moment of freedom, before being struck down in the back of my head.

“Huh?” I yelp, turning around to see a fish hovering in the air. It didn’t have any wings, it didn’t have hands, it was just a regular black sea bass.

“Oi watch where ya goin’ kiddo!” He screams, somehow. “I got lady fish ta meet!”

“I’m sorry, what?” I could only ask.

“Wat, you’ never seen a ‘overing talking fish before?” He asked, as if he wasn’t some freak of nature. “C’mon lady, I don’ have time. Move over, the fish brothel is calling my name! I can hear Mrs Fish O’Finnegan swooning to my fishly fin muscles while we listen to Eelvis Presley and bone! Oooh yeah, I’m gonna make so many eggs with her! And then I’m going to get some milk and leave all but one of the eggs to get mercilessly eaten! Then he’ll make me a blockbuster film!

Outta my way!”

He slipped passed my head, disappearing off into the crowd while screaming something about an anemone up someone’ ass.

Unable to hold my breath any longer, I dropped back down to the ground, thankfully in an alleyway with less people inside. Catching my breath, I was startled as someone tapped on my shoulder from behind.

Spinning on my heels, I faced a man completely hidden by greyish clothing. He was wearing a trench coat that dragged along the floor, while his hands were covered by gloves. His fedora was held down low, his eyes blocked by sunglasses, and he was wearing a thick scarf around him. The only sliver of skin I could catch was just above his scarf. It looked, gloopy, and unnaturally pale. But before I could look harder, he pulled up his scarf, hiding away every inch of skin.

“Hey, you want some of that dough?” He asked in a deep voice. There was a hint of amusement, as if there was a joke I wasn’t getting.

“No thanks.” I refused. I didn’t know what “dough” stood for, and I don’t think I want to know. I took a step back, but he pressed on.

“Don’t be shy.” He crooned. “Its fresh and cheap. And its unmonitored by the bread mafia.”

“Bread?”

Reaching into his coat pocket, he pulled out a loaf of bread. I stare at it in confusion.

“I got rye, sourdough, focaccia, pita. None of that brioche bullshit though. Those bread elitists in the bread government are trying to establish a bread hierarchy, but they can’t obscure the bread truth from us. The bread fr\*nch will never oppress our bread opinions.” Seeing that I looked utterly confused, he chuckled. “Never mind that, though. I’ll toss you a bread bargain, how about that? One loaf free for every loaf you buy.”

But before I could even say anything, a flash of movement behind the bread dealer caught my eye. In a flash, half a dozen men appeared out of nowhere, jumping the bread dealer. But instead of holding weapons, they held pastries in their hands.

One guy was holding two croissants in a reverse grip like they were daggers, while another had a baguette sheathed like a sword. A third man was wearing a loaf of brioche like knuckle dusters, while a fourth was racing forward with a ficelle as if it were a rapier. Finally, the two men standing on the roof of the two buildings above threw loaves of fougasse like they were cutting saws.

“THEY’RE ONTO ME!” The bread dealer screamed, but it was too late he was pinned down in an instant.

“WE FINALLY GOT YOU, YOU SON OF A WONDERBREAD!” One of the men screamed. In one fell swoop, he reached out to the bread dealer and ripped off all his clothes. But they didn’t expose a naked man, but instead a blob of white. The man was made entirely out of uncooked dough, formed into a human figure. It looked disgusting, filled with various debris that landed on it, and it looked like it was melting.

“NOOOOO! YOU’LL NEVER SILENCE US! OUR BREAD RIGHTEOUSNESS WILL BREAD PREVAIL! BREAD PREVAILLLLL!” He screamed, thrashing violently.

“Tell that to bread devil down in bread hell.” The man said, before spawning a toaster from thin air and chucking the man made of dough inside. Shoving him down the toaster, it hummed for a few seconds, before dinging. Popping out of the toaster was a perfectly golden loaf of Galette.

I stared in shock, unable to even comprehend what was happening. One of the men turned to me with a relaxed smile on his face, as if he didn’t bake a dough man in a toaster.

“Sorry about that, we had a bread fugitive escape his bread cell. You’re bread safe now.”

And without another word, they vanished, leaving a crepe on the floor. In chocolate sauce, it read out.

“The Bread Mafia never forgets” with a shoddy looking picture of the dough man. If it wasn’t for the 4 annotations made to the portrait, I would have never guessed what it was supposed to be.

I stood in silence in the alleyway.

“Am I on drugs? Did I do something last night?” I rubbed my temples. I groaned. “I need some coffee.”  

Stumbling out the alleyway, I was immediately met with one of the most prominent coffee shops in the city, Café Del Fin. It wasn’t particularly known for its good food but rather was a place for beyonders to loiter and where bounty posters were often posted. Without any other option, I walked in.

The busy shop was almost full, but I squeezed through and found a table in the corner. Sitting down, a waiter came up to me.

“Hello! Would you like a coffee?” It was a young looking man, a part time detective I hired previously. The café’s owner, Kat. I groaned out an answer.

“I’d like a-” but before I could finish my order, a scream came from across the shop.

“THERE’S VIAGRA IN THE COFFEEE!” Someone screamed, clutching at their crotch. There was a second of silence, like everyone was buffering. Then, everyone spat out their coffee in unison, standing up in unison and storming out the café in unison.

“Where’s the nearest brothel??” One man cried out.

“The fish brothel down two blocks!” A woman wailed.

“Good enough for me!” A third person bellowed desperately.

“This is a great excus- I mean oh noooo! I have to visit the fish brothel!”

The café was soon left with clattering silence.

I slammed my head onto the wooden table, seeing if blunt force trauma could wake me from this fever dream.

“Would you like some coffee?” Kat asked, seemingly unperturbed.

“Is there Viagra in it?” I mumbled.

“I can not deny nor confirm.” He beamed. I didn’t know how to respond.

“… What the fuck is happening?” I groaned, unable to understand what was going on today.

“Haha, the Twilight Festival sure is lively, isn’t it?” He chuckled.

“That’s certainly one way to put it.”

“Are you participating in the main event?” He asked, sitting next to me and pouring himself a cup of tea.

“There’s a main event? The flyer only had pictures of explosions.”

“There’s a tournament for Beyonders.” He said. “I don’t know how they’re doing it but supposedly no one can die. It’s a great way to show off some skill. I heard you’re strong, are you participating?”

“You know me? From who?” I asked, baffled.

“Poetic. He’s the janitor here. He hasn’t been doing too well recently, especially after his ascension to Calamity Priest. But he talks about you a fair bit.” I nodded in understanding. I had heard from him before that he worked at a café somewhere.

“A tournament, huh.” I grimaced. “Is it going to be as crazy and corrupted as the rest of the festival?”

“Who knows?” He mused. “There’s going to be a lot of people though.”

Sighing, I got up. Even if I didn’t decide to participate, it sounded interesting enough. And there was nothing else to do.

So I went off.

* Portable Magic: Downloadable and ready for on-the-go study, perfect for sneaking in review during breaks between clinicals or late-night coffee runs.

Armed with this guide, Sarah faced the exam’s trials. She tackled questions on beta blockers, outsmarted dosage calculations, and navigated patient teaching scenarios with ease.

On exam day, Sarah strode into the arena, her mind sharp and her heart steady. The questions came fast, but the Duke guide had trained her well.

Both my wife and I were exhausted because of the nonstop turbulence. The thought of walking around the market for hours did not sound great. 

From previous travels I have used the a ""day pass"" to use airline lounges for long layovers. So, I looked up all of the lounges at the airport so that we could spend some time, get a quick bite and relax before we board.  Delta does not offer a day pass but Turkish Airlines does. On the website it mentioned that you have to have a ticket for a flight that day but you can use your ticket that you arrived with. It cost $45 per person however there is no time limit for your stay. 

The food was good and it was nice to have unlimited access to free coffee. They also have loungers that you can use. The website did mention that they have a shower but we did not use it or see them. 

I would highly recommend going to the Turkish Airline Lounge if you flew in the day of the cruise and want to relax before the flight. ",9,1752418557.0,VirginVoyages,2,0.8,False

We finally decided to meet up.

He suggested this super cute coffee shop, so there we are, sipping overpriced lattes, when he suddenly drops that he's planning a 'casual' hiking trip in the Alps... for TWO WEEKS! I laughed, thinking he was making a joke, but nope, he was dead serious. I thought he meant casual like, let's see where this goes—he meant casual like, I casually plan my life months in advance. 

I guess that's when it hit me how 'casual' can mean wildly different things! It was a great date nonetheless, we laughed about his intense travel plans and my lack of hiking shoes. Imo, the whole thing wasn't a deal-breaker, just a hilarious misunderstanding.

Then it was time for me to meet his family, the first time I met his family were not pleased with me because I came from  a middle class family, his family are rich. He would always defend me against them. His siblings and his other relatives would make my life a living hell but my ex was there for me always. When we got married his parents did not attend to the wedding nor his siblings, they all made an excuses for not attending no matter how much he tried to convince them and give us their blessings. 

Two years later we were accepting a baby but we suffered a miscarriage and it was devastating, I was so depressed, but my ex would comfort me thourgh the most difficult time. When my ex told his parents about the miscarriage, they invited us to their house to spend time together, I thought we were going to mend our relationship but I was wrong, when we went to their house for family gathering, everyone ignored me especially their friends, no one wanted to talk to me but I stayed quiet but his mom introduced me to my ex husband's ex girlfriend (now current wife). She was actually nice to me. She told me I was lucky to marry my ex even though they had dreams to get married and have kids together and I kinda felt offended by that but I let it go. Then everything changed, my ex became cold distance from me, everytime I wanted to have intimacy, he would shut me down or when he gets home from work and I would try to kiss him, he pushes me away(Mind you I was a housewife at that) He would complain about the being dirty and stuff like that. When I got home from the grocery store, I heard moaning sounds in our bedroom, when I got there, I saw my ex and his current wife in our bed . When I asked him what the hell was going on, He told me that he was in love with her,wants to start his life with her, she was his soulmate and they were meant to be together.He said that I was the biggest mistake of his life and can't give him any children while he was getting out of the bed to put his underwear on, I asked him how long have they been having an affair, then his wife told it's none of my business and that I should know he chose her and they are planning to get married (he proposed her in two weeks). He said he prepared the divorce paper and I should sign them in court in three days and then he walked out of the room with his wife holding hands. I was so devastated and heartbroken that the man I loved would actually do this to me. Three days has past and it was time to end our marriage. His wife, parents and his sister were there at court and I was pretty sure they were excited and waited for this day to come. He told his lawyer I can keep the house but not his money, he didn't leave me a dime. Once we finished filing a divorce, I heard his mom say they go and celebrate his divorce and his upcoming wedding. I'm not gonna lie it really hurts me a lot to the I started eating and drinking a lot, I was depressed and lonely. But on the my friend who is loving and caring scolded me for wasting my time about a man who broke my heart in worst cruel way and I should move on and get help. I was so blessed to have such a friend like her.

I went to school, got my Masters Degree, a career, a beautiful house, I remarried to my wonderful husband and two amazing children. So five weeks ago I received a call from an unknown number but I got curious and answered, when I answered the call, I heard my ex's voice. I couldn't understand how he got my number. On the phone he said he's sorry for everything and things he said in the past, he would like to see me for last time because he had cancer and doesn't have much time, he would if I came to see him. I said to him that I was sorry what he's thourgh and I don't see him nor have anything to do with him then I hung up blocked him. Then I get another call from his sister that my ex has passed away and I should come, I asked about his wife, she said my ex wanted to be surrounded with the he was close to and part of his life, I thanked her but declined the invitation and told her never to call me again. So two days ago I received a text messages from his mum saying I'm bitter, selfish b*tch and all my ex wanted was to be close with his loved and I'm AH. I have been getting calls and messages as well as threats. I showed 
my husband text messages and decided to switch phones just in case so that we can report them. But sometimes I feel little guilty for not seeing him? So am I the asshole?

1lyurcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lyurcm/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_zwilling/,Explore the best electric kettle ZWILLING Enfinigy worth buying today,"Testing the ZWILLING Enfinigy 53105-100-0 electric kettle was a surprisingly pleasant journey. I’m someone who keeps my mornings structured—coffee, quick breakfast, and out the door. A kettle might seem like just another appliance, but this one found its place in both my routine and my heart. This sleek, German-engineered kettle didn’t just heat water; it added a touch of elegance to my countertop while doing it.

**Design & Aesthetic Appeal**  
The design is a standout feature. With its silver finish and minimalist, polished appearance, this kettle fits beautifully into any kitchen. Compact at 9.37""L x 8.77""W x 9.6""H, it doesn’t hog counter space, which I always appreciate. Plus, the double-walled stainless steel keeps the exterior cool to the touch. No accidental burns when my nephew tried to use it during family breakfast. And that seamless look? It makes cleaning effortless—just a quick wipe, and it’s sparkling again.  

[Check ZWILLING Enfinigy 53105-100-0 price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b09x6bhbfq/)  

**Performance & Heating**  
For a 1-liter kettle, it punches above its weight. The boil time is impressively quick, easily shaving several minutes off my mornings. It heats water evenly, avoiding inconsistencies I’ve faced with lesser models. The 70-degree lid opening eliminates that blast of hot steam that usually threatens to turn my kitchen into a sauna, meaning it’s safer around both kids and clumsy adults like me who often misjudge their hand positions.

**Functionality & Features**  
The features on this electric kettle are pretty thoughtful. For starters, the seamless inner design minimizes residue buildup, which is always a hidden issue with kettles. The 30-minute keep-warm function was a surprise favorite of mine, especially during long stretches of work-from-home calls when reheating water becomes an unnecessary chore. If you’re a tea aficionado like my sister, having precise temperature controls with pre-set programs on the Pro version is a game-changer. Sadly, this model doesn’t boast those presets, but its manual simplicity still delivers exactly as required.  

**Usage & Durability**  
This is one durable kettle. At 2.86 pounds, there’s just enough heft to feel sturdy without being clunky or unwieldy. I used it daily for coffee and tea prep, and it powered through like a champ. With hand-wash-only care, the powder-coated finish stays sharp, though I’d wish for an option to pop it in the dishwasher for convenience on lazy days.

**Advantages**  
- The double-wall design ensures a cool touch exterior.
- Quick and consistent heating with no hot spots.  
- Elegant, compact design suitable for any kitchen.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The lack of temperature presets may be missed by serious tea enthusiasts.
- At just 1 liter, it might feel limiting for larger households or gatherings.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other electric kettles, like the Breville Smart Kettle or the Cuisinart PerfectTemp, the ZWILLING Enfinigy offers a simpler interface without compromising build quality. While the competing brands might include additional features like multiple temperature settings, ZWILLING gets bonus points for its seamless design and stylish finish. It easily outperforms some of the clunkier designs on the market and feels equally premium. The only glaring downside is its capacity, as competitors often offer a bit more room for water.

**Worth Every Penny**  
At its price point, the ZWILLING Enfinigy electric kettle feels like a premium pick for compact households. While you might pay a little extra compared to budget models, what you’re truly buying is a combination of sleek design, sturdy performance, and thoughtful safety features. It bridges the gap between aesthetics and daily utility in a way only a well-crafted product can.

We had a lot of things in common and we quickly scheduled a reading date. I was excited for it at first but I started to feel unsettled about it inexplicably. I had a funeral to go to the day before but I made sure to set an alarm before I passed out from exhaustion. For some reason, my alarm didn’t go off and I overslept by an hour. I profusely apologized and I asked for a reschedule, planned by me. She was understanding and we scheduled a reading date in the park for the following weekend.

Everything went awry. I couldn’t sleep and I got that same feeling again but I decided to push through it because I assumed it was nerves. I woke up with a headache. I couldn’t find anything (I am normally organized) and nothing was turning out right, from skincare to makeup. I ordered some premade picnic sandwiches, fruit, and snacks to be delivered three hours before and it never arrived. So, I finally call my uber and put the finishing touches on my makeup. She tells me where the entrance is to the gardens and I set my location for it. My drink splashed on me a few times and my driver was speeding. When I get there, both entrances were blocked by cars and police due to an event. It’s extremely muggy and there are a ton of runners. I try to send a message, but due to the remote location, it doesn’t go through. I looked for her and waited for about 25 minutes. I gave up and called my uber home.

1lyuoz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealmOfDungeons/comments/1lyuoz3/devblog_3_quest_and_dungeon_game_loop_from_static/,DevBlog #3: Quest and Dungeon Game Loop - From Static to Dynamic,"Welcome back to another development update! Today I want to dive deep into one of the most crucial aspects of Realm of Dungeons - the quest and dungeon system. This has been one of the biggest transformations in the game's development, and I'm excited to share how we evolved from a static, limited system to a dynamic, infinitely scalable adventure experience.

# The Original Vision vs. Reality

When I first started developing Realm of Dungeons, I had a very different vision for progression. The original concept was built around **location-based progression** with minimum level requirements. Here's how it was supposed to work:

* Each location would be unlocked at specific character levels
* Every location contained exactly 5 monsters, 4 packs of monsters, and 1 boss
* Players needed to defeat 25 monsters to unlock the first pack
* Then 50 monsters to unlock the second pack
* Then 75 monsters to unlock the third pack
* Finally, 100 monsters to unlock the boss and progress to the next stage

This seemed like a solid progression system on paper, but as development continued, I wasn't 100% sure if this would work well in practice. Before we even entered the Closed Beta, I decided to make the change to avoid potential issues.

https://preview.redd.it/l3ccrvrplncf1.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ef1c1cafd80d5eff5478b5da56c1756cd38864f

https://preview.redd.it/y3ah5h3rlncf1.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=d39d35caa08ae65d366c6391223c5c06dd3628f7

# The Anticipated Problems

Even before launching the Closed Beta, I could see several critical issues that would emerge with the static system:

# 1. Limited Content Ceiling

The most obvious issue was the **level cap limitation**. With static monster levels and manually balanced stats, I had only created content up to around level 40. I could already predict that dedicated players would reach this cap quickly, and then be faced with nothing to do - which is every game developer's nightmare.

# 2. Repetitive Grinding

The system required players to defeat the same enemy **100 times** just to unlock the next stage. While some grinding is expected in RPGs, this level of repetition was mind-numbing. Players weren't experiencing variety or excitement - they were just clicking through the same combat scenarios over and over.

# 3. Manual Balancing Nightmare

Every single monster had static stats that I needed to manually balance. This meant that adding new content was incredibly time-consuming, and maintaining balance across all levels was nearly impossible. As a solo developer working alongside a full-time job, this approach simply wasn't sustainable.

# 4. Lack of Excitement

Without randomness or variation, players always knew exactly what was coming next. There were no surprises.

# The Revolutionary Change: Dynamic Quest System

After recognizing these fundamental issues during development, I made the decision to completely overhaul the system before the Closed Beta launch. The new approach focuses on **dynamic, level-scaling content** that can theoretically provide infinite progression.

# How the New System Works

Instead of static locations, we now have a **random quest generation system**:

1. **Three Random Quests**: Players are presented with 3 randomly generated quests to choose from
2. **Location Context**: Each quest still takes place in a specific location, maintaining the world-building aspect
3. **Level-Scaled Enemies**: All enemies now scale with the player's level, eliminating the level cap problem
4. **Encounter Variety**: Players can encounter regular monsters, packs of monsters, and bosses all within the quest system

This approach is heavily inspired by the classic **Shakes & Fidget** system, which proved that random quest generation could create engaging, long-term gameplay.

https://preview.redd.it/uic0bp1vlncf1.png?width=1656&format=png&auto=webp&s=0aa2987ea5118a4541b33aa9b048ffb12f6975e3

# The Benefits of This Approach

**Infinite Scalability**: Since enemies scale with player level, there's theoretically no level cap. Players can continue progressing indefinitely.

**Reduced Repetition**: The randomness means players rarely face the same exact scenario twice, keeping the experience fresh.

**Automated Balance**: Instead of manually balancing hundreds of monsters, the scaling system automatically adjusts difficulty based on player progression.

**Surprise Factor**: Players never know if their next quest will be a simple monster encounter or an exciting boss fight.

# The Stamina System: Managing Pacing

The quest system is balanced through a **stamina-based economy** that has also evolved significantly during development.

# Stamina Costs and Rewards

* **Minimum stamina cost**: 1 stamina per quest
* **Maximum stamina cost**: 7 stamina per quest
* **Item quests**: Always cost 6 stamina (guaranteed equipment rewards)
* **Boss quests**: Always cost 7 stamina (highest XP and gold rewards)
* **Scaling rewards**: Higher stamina costs provide proportionally better XP and gold rewards

# Stamina Regeneration Evolution

**Original System**:

* 100 total stamina
* 4-hour full refresh from first quest completion
* Very restrictive for active players

**Current System**:

* 200 total stamina
* 8-hour full refresh
* Partial regeneration (25 stamina per hour)
* More frequent play sessions possible

**Premium Account Benefits**:

* Same total regeneration (mathematically identical)
* 12.5 stamina every 30 minutes instead of 25 every hour
* Allows for more flexible play schedules

This system encourages regular engagement without demanding constant attention, fitting perfectly with our philosophy of respecting players' time.

# Dungeons: The Real Challenge Layer

While the quest system provides the core progression loop, **dungeons** add another layer of challenging content for dedicated players.

https://preview.redd.it/cbma1zz2mncf1.png?width=1656&format=png&auto=webp&s=10e8fd7c94c8a89f0454d550d972d4ceb233b9d5

# What Makes Dungeons Special

**Challenging Encounters**: Dungeon monsters are significantly tougher than their quest counterparts, requiring strategic thinking and proper equipment.

**Treasure Rewards**: Each defeated dungeon enemy grants access to their treasure, which contains higher-quality loot than standard quests.

**Progression Gates**: Dungeons unlock at specific levels, providing milestone goals for players to work toward.

**Elite Content**: This system creates a natural difficulty curve where casual players can enjoy quests while hardcore players can tackle dungeons for better rewards.

# The Impact on Player Experience

The transformation from static to dynamic systems has fundamentally changed how Realm of Dungeons feels to play:

# Before: Predictable but Limited

* Players knew exactly what to expect
* Clear progression markers
* Inevitable content drought
* Repetitive gameplay

# After: Dynamic and Endless

* Every play session offers surprises
* Infinite progression potential
* Varied encounters keep things fresh
* Sustainable long-term engagement

# Looking at the Validation

The beta testing results have validated this decision:

* **Predicted issue avoided**: Players can now progress indefinitely without hitting content walls
* **Player retention**: The dynamic system has created sustained engagement
* **Engagement**: Players enjoy more frequent, shorter play sessions
* **Two weeks in**: Our most dedicated players have already surpassed what would have been the level 40 cap, confirming the original system would have failed

# Final Thoughts

The quest and dungeon system now represents the heart of Realm of Dungeons, and I'm excited to see how players continue to engage with it as we add more features and content in the coming months.

# Next DevBlog

The next development update will focus on the **equipment and progression systems** how I've designed item rarity, stat scaling, and the satisfaction of finding that perfect piece of gear. I'll also dive into some of the upcoming features that will shape community aspect of the game.

As always, I'm developing this game alongside my full-time job, so updates come between work and life. Your patience and support mean everything to me!

## **The Scout in Sector B-7**     
     
They called him **Scouty** because he beeped whenever he saw something interesting, which, for Scouty, was nearly everything.

A half-buried shoe? *Beep-beep.*
A noodle cup rolling in the breeze? *Beep-beep-beep.*
A bird perched on a rebar crossbeam? *Long, curious boop.*

The locals weren’t sure what to do with Scouty at first. They knew what drones usually did: screaming engines, flash of muzzle, bodies on the ground.

But Scouty never fired. Instead, he seemed lost. He trundled down rubble-strewn streets on his tank treads, antenna bobbing, a camera lens swiveling like a curious child’s eyes. He would pause, tilt, record, and occasionally emit a cheerful *chirrup* when a pigeon flapped too close.

---

**Suri**, a girl who sold fried cakes at the corner where the roof was half-missing, was the first to approach him.

“You’re lost, huh?” she said, tossing a bit of fried batter near him.

Scouty rolled forward, scanned it, beeped happily, and sucked it into a small hatch for analysis. A green LED heart blinked on his screen.

Suri laughed for the first time in weeks.
.
---  

Far away, in a cold bunker, **Analyst Greer** sipped coffee and marked the blinking icon labeled “SCOUT-771 off-line.” 

“Asia Pacific sector terrain grid stuck at 87%,” an AI assistant chirped. “Scout-771 is still missing.”

“Let's keep the others mapping,” Greer muttered, turning his gaze to the global feed.

The screen was a mosaic of Scoutys, all over the world:
– Scout-552 trundling through **South American barrios**
– Scout-883 navigating **African market streets**
– Scout-229 rolling under collapsed **European overpasses**

Each one beeped and chirped, projecting hearts and smiley faces, playing harmless while their **lidar, infrared, seismic, and chemical sniffers logged every inch of human terrain**.

The *world* was being measured by smiling machines.

---

In Sector B-7, Scouty found a dead pigeon.

His camera eye paused, tilting, as if in mourning. A claw reached out, gently tapping the feathers, logging humidity, bacterial content, wind direction.

*Beep.*

He turned to the half-collapsed building, scanning every crack, archway, and exposed steel rebar.

---

**Special Forces Team Lima-9** arrived at dawn.

“Retrieve and wipe-down,” the briefing had said. “Priority high.”

“Priority?” Calloway scoffed as they moved in. “It’s a lost toy.”

“Just do it.”

They found Scouty painting the wall with mud using a bent spoon, copying the pigeons’ streaks above.

Scouty’s screen lit up: 🙂

Calloway lowered his rifle, watching the small machine’s earnest mimicry.

“Don’t get attached,” muttered the tech as he connected the data leash.

---

Scouty’s systems flickered as the connection locked.

He emitted a soft beep, then a compressed data burst.

In the bunker, Greer leaned forward as the data poured in.

“Upload complete. Terrain mapping 100%,” the AI reported.

Greer’s eyes flicked to the global board. Other Scoutys were sending their data too:
– **Istanbul, 98%**
– **Lagos, 96%**
– **Quito, 99%**

Each beep from each Scouty was another piece of the world ready for analysis, for precision targeting, for the next phase of autonomous warfare.

---

They harnessed Scouty to the retrieval drone. He beeped softly, camera eye sweeping across the street where Suri stood, clutching her bread basket, confused.

Scouty’s screen displayed:
❤️

She waved.

Scouty beeped again as he was lifted into the air, eyes locked on the ground below.

---

In the bunker, Greer’s supervisor arrived, scanning the feeds.

“Nice work,” the supervisor said. “The systems are ready. Strike planning will proceed.”

Greer nodded, then glanced again at Scouty’s final log: a crude mud drawing of a bird, a stick figure, and a heart.

*Beep.*

---

Above Sector B-7, clouds gathered, heavy and dark, as the first autonomous strike drones were activated, engines whining like a swarm.

Scouty was offline for real now, stored for redeployment.

All over the world, Scoutys had done their job with a smile.

After a few months of development I'm really happy to announce [https://www.spro.so](https://www.spro.so) \- it is an online platform encompassing a website and mobile app for tracking and discovering new coffees (open signups soon!)

**My Problem:** I got sick of tracking coffees by hoarding old bags, and kinda struggled to find my next bag - and was also not willing to give up my choices to a subscription.  Or often times I'd stare at a $25 bag that just says ""grape soda, lilac funk"" with zero context about what I'm getting into before committing to dialing it in all week.

**What Spro does**:

* Build your own coffee journal
* Rate and review each coffee you drink
* Discover similar coffees
* Save and share recipes (i.e. we both have DF64, so lemme steal you setting / dosage / etc)
* Browse coffees by: variety, roaster, process, country, or even flavor notes

**Who are we:** Everything is built by me and my friend Alex.  I'm a software engineer based in Chicago so doing this stuff was fun for me.  I roped in Alex to do the data science stuff for me because clustering algorithms and kind of a lot.

**Where does the data come from?**  
In short, it's aggregated from roaster websites. I didn't want blurry phone pictures of coffee bags cluttering the site - we automatically pull high-quality product photos and detailed specs. We have background jobs that continuously add and enrich the data, but I've also built tools for users to add missing coffees and (even better!) for roasters to add and manage their own profiles directly.

**Try it out**: The site is live for browsing - you can explore the coffee database, test the flavor discovery system, and see what we're building.

We are still in a closed beta, but I would love for y'all to hit the email list so I can keep you up-to-date.  I will really be looking for beta testers and early adopters for feedback in the very near future.

***Also*** \- if you are a roaster - please DM me or reach out at [gabe@spro.so](mailto:gabe@spro.so)!  I built this platform with you in mind and want you to be a part of this journey.

""We realized traditional programmers weren't cutting it,"" said AI researcher Dr. Melanie Brewster, sipping her seventh coffee of the morning. ""Managing large language models (LLMs) is less about programming and more like guiding a room full of caffeinated squirrels through interpretive dance routines.""

Experts agree that LLMs, while powerful, possess the attention span and memory capacity of a goldfish that spent too many years watching TikTok videos. Quantization, the practice of trimming down an AI’s parameters to save costs has been compared by critics to performing delicate surgery with a rusty chainsaw.

""Sure, the AI is cheaper,"" remarked Brewster, ""but it's also now perpetually confused, mildly anxious, and forgetful, basically like every intern we’ve ever hired.""

The ideal candidate, according to recent job listings, should have ""experience calmly navigating chaos, managing erratic and forgetful behavior, and guiding individuals who frequently lose track of their primary objectives.""

When asked about the controversial hiring strategy, tech executive Brandon Hayes shrugged. ""Look, our goal is simple: shout vaguely at a team of confused AI agents and somehow still get useful work. Who better to orchestrate that than someone who's handled literal chaos for a living?""

At press time, mental health professionals were reportedly eager to pivot, noting that managing unpredictable AI was ""probably less stressful"" than their previous roles.",1,1752417685.0,E_Worker,0,1.0,False

Irecently launched one of my projects ""StreamCloud"" on the Play Store, a video content app that blends the best of YouTube and TikTok, but without the stuff that burns people out.

Heres what makes it different:

✅ No fullscreen ads – Just a single banner ad, so you can keep watching without interruption. (You wont realize how relaxing this is until you try it.)

💰 Cheap premium tier – Unlock all features for less than your monthly coffee habit. Seriously.

🎨 Customizable colors – Personalize the apps look to match your vibe with a one-time purchase (currently includes multiple color themes, images coming soon!).

🧠 Shorts Timeout – This is the feature I wish TikTok had. It helps stop doomscrolling by nudging you to take breaks from endless short videos. You can even set a specific timeout duration to temporarily block shorts. Mental health matters.

📱 Lightweight, smooth, no bloat – Designed to be fast and simple, not another ad machine.

And there's a lot more coming. Creator features/tools, Social tools, better algorithms, etc.

I built StreamCloud because I felt like the big platforms just arent listening to their users anymore. They maximize ads, data grabs, and addiction loops.

If that resonates with you, Id love for you to try it out and let me know what you think. Every download, review, or piece of feedback helps me keep improving it.

I'm looking for someone willing to settle down in the next two years, ideally, and who is genuinely interested in finding someone. They should be willing to put in the effort to have meaningful conversations, rather than just adding and ghosting.

• I’m a proud cat dad 🐈

• A business owner (I run a remote consulting agency that helps progressive campaigns and nonprofits)

• A huge nerd — into Star Wars, Star Trek, Marvel, ASOIAF, and basically all things sci-fi/fantasy

• Gamer (mostly WoW but also Marvel Rivals, Minecraft, Vintage Story, Stellaris, and many others), with the same online friend group for almost a decade

• Often described as gregarious, funny, and the “organizer” of the group

• 6’, brown hair, blue eyes — a bit overweight but actively working on it

I work from home, which is great, but it means I’m not always out meeting people. I’d love to make connections — whether that’s grabbing coffee, hitting up a trivia night, watching something together, playing a game together, or just hanging out and geeking out about our favorite fandoms.

Let me take you back to The Beginning about a year ago when I was just tiptoeing into the world of filter coffee. And hoo boy, I made mistakes. So many mistakes.

Exhibit A: I didn’t have a traditional filter. So what did I do? Boiled the coffee powder with milk. Yes. Boiled. It. With. Milk. 🙃 It obviously curdled like my hopes and dreams, and I’d just sit there sipping chunky sadness.

Then came Phase 2 of the disaster arc: I decided to boil the coffee powder with water and then pour it into hot milk. Did it curdle? No. Did it taste right? Absolutely not. It was giving… weirdly bitter soap opera.

Fast forward a few months, I proudly bought myself a filter coffee maker and thought I’d cracked the code. But nope. Too watery, too weak, or just plain meh. Plus, the whole filter coffee brand hunt? A spiritual journey. The decoction-to-milk ratio? A cryptic puzzle.

Enter: The Maid.
A few months ago, I hired a cook—and one fine morning, she made me coffee. I mentioned my past sins of boiling the coffee powder, and her expression was priceless. Half shocked, half insulted 😂 That’s when she gently broke it to me: “Ma’am, you never boil the powder… just pour hot water over it.”

Cue my existential crisis.
BUT the good news? She now makes the most divine kaapi ever, and I’ve finally cracked the filter coffee code thanks to her wisdom.
We’re now in our golden brew era. ☕💫

Help me hack my diet for fat loss/muscle gain? I've been meticulously tracking what I eat on Cronometer for the last 30 days. Weighing everything and logging it is a huge pain (kudos to those of you that do it regularly! that's hard work!) but I've got lots of data now.

I had my blood work done last week and everything is great except slightly low HDL. Sedentary at the moment (working two jobs, both of which are desk jobs) but looking to get more active as well (my priority this last month was giving up the alcohol habit!). I have bad GERD so I have low tolerance for being ""full"". Large salads with lots of bulk set it off, and very oily (fried) foods and refined flours tend to give me heartburn so I avoid those if I can. Hoping the GERD problem will get better as I lose weight. I don't know my body fat percentage but I assume it's quite high because I am very jiggly (I suffered from muscle wasting in my 20s due to hyperthyroid and never really recovered my muscle.)

**Food preferences:** I have some food allergies but they are easily avoidable. I don't like olives, I don't have a sweet tooth, and I've followed a vegan diet for about 20 years. I don't like sugary sodas but I love diet pepsi. I don't eat or drink (except water) after dinner because I'll wake up with heartburn at night. I'm not really big on snacking.

**Cooking preferences:** I HATE cooking. I'm a good cook but I hate to do it, so I prefer to stick to easy things like sheet cooking or one pot cooking. I often bulk cook so I don't have to cook again the next day.

I hope sooner rather than later.

His youngest brother acts like he is the king of the house. He won’t let me work from home in the study room or in the living room because he says he needs both rooms at the same time? He is really controlling when it comes to opening windows and doors every day. On several weekends, he came in and opened the door whilst me and my boyfriend were sleeping to “allow the air to get through”. We could have been naked or whatever. He says we have to get into the routine of leaving all the doors open all the time but then his and the other brother’s doors are closed. He is also really jealous in his nature:

He is trying to lose weight for a new job- he can’t do it very well because he eats entire packets cheese at 3am and packets of icing and drinks several litres of cola and sprite a day. He gave me a lift in his car and explicitly said: You really need to watch what you are eating and you need to also do a sport! You also need to stop being a child, my brother also ( my boyfriend). You are both like my children and I tell all my friends that. Sorry? But I can live how I wish, I never thought my weight is an issue as I’m not overweight but now I’m starting to feel self conscious and I’m annoyed that he can see what I’m eating and is constantly making horrible comments. He also said I am drunk all the time, in front of his mother, which isn’t true. Then also said I HAVE to stop putting sugar in my coffee. Erm no? i told my boyfriend all this and that he was horrible about us both and he said it’s easier to leave it. And he hasn’t even told him off or spoken to him and said we are angry or upset. He will never stick up for me with it.

The child comment hurt the most since I am the only person in the house who works and I am the only one who pays the bills on the house since this mean brother has no job already since 8 months, the other brother is having a holiday semester and my boyfriend is trying to finish his studies. The rich uncle pays for the bills, and me.

Any advice on how to not go crazy living with this guy ? My boyfriend is also not being supportive and he always takes their side to avoid “drama/ arguments”, which he thinks aren’t worth it. But then this youngest brother never gets taught that you can’t speak to people like that and have the audacity to just go around speaking to people like rubbish.",2,1752416538.0,relationships_advice,0,1.0,False

We agreed to take it slow and not rush things so that we can for sure be on the same page. 
She's worked at a dispensary for a year and for a good portion of that time worked with a guy who she vibed with very well. She never once has mentioned any interest in him. She did tell me then when he got fired (pointed out) she said that she wanted to stay in touch and maybe he could meet me, he said that it would not be a good idea because he liked her and he would only be thinking of her in a sexual way rather than a coworker.
A few months go by and I asked if they ever contacted each other. She said they just liked each other's posts but that's about it. I planted the idea of her messaging him and to try and plant the idea of us meeting up for coffee. She was hesitant for a few weeks because she didn't want to jeopardize our marriage or their friendship. I said ""just see what happens"".
She did and he is somewhat interested and stand-offish at the same time (understandably). Personally, I would want us to invite another woman but I said if inviting another man first would ease her into it first, I would agree and do my best. I have never met him but she says that we are a lot alike. Similar interests, views, and demeanor.
He seems like a decent guy but I'm having trouble getting past the idea of sharing my wife with another man. I realize it was my idea to introduce the idea of involving another, but I feel hypocritical for not being so open minded to another man.

Each tower (in order of construction) are the central tower, the food plant, the hospital (construction paused early on), the storage tower, The Great Coffee Tower, the tree farm, the metal refinery, the robot factory, and the gear/treated plank factory (still under construction)

Currently the tallest tower in the city is The Great Coffee Tower. This tower maintains a stockpile of thousands of cups of coffee at all times, with a relaxation zone at the top. It is probably by far the most popular tower in the city, and not just because of the admendities at the top.

Image 16 shows the thumbnail for the first save of this settlement (10/12/24), while image 17 shows the thumbnail for the most recent save (7/12/25). Everything in that first image is still there, with minor modifications.

The current project is the transformation of the grand reservoir into a hydroelectric dam, using pumps to keep the water level up. My hope is to get 8cms of flow out of this power plant. There should be enough pumps to support that, however there is some concern that after powering the pumps, there will not be 18,000hp left over to power the rest of the city. I dont know how much power the pumps will take.

I love this save, and plan to keep it going for the foreseeable future. My favorite part of it is definitely this skyline. What do you guys think?",10,1752416431.0,Timberborn,0,1.0,False

I hate waking up early and when I do, I want to be left tf alone until I’m ready to function. Let me have a cup of coffee before you come at me with some shit. That mess of dishes you made last night isn’t getting done right now. Don’t call me on the phone before 10:00. 

Conversely, I am productive late into the night. I get anxiety in the mornings. I feel calm when it’s dark out at night. Maybe it’s because everyone expects me to get shit done in the morning, and no one expects me to get shit done at night. It’s all on me at that time. 

Let me wake up at 7:30 am, have two cups of coffee, get a bite to eat, and start at 10:00 am and I’ll be wound up and ready to get stuff done until 12:00am. That means I’m okay with being on for 14 hours a day, but it’s just at a different time of the day. That’s how I roll. You morning people can FO.",1,1752416343.0,rant,4,0.56,False

In the last 15-30 mins of almost every day, especially during busy days and weeks, we get a ton of staff ordering. They get lots of frapps and similarly irritating drinks. We’ve expressed that it’s frustrating being slammed with employees when our close is typically only 2 people and we want to do what we can do pre close. Yet they still come in and will even get in line when there’s a big line at close . 

This week has been especially insane, probably the busiest since I started working at this location about a year ago. Yesterday a higher up was getting several drinks for employees the last fifteen minutes before we closed. They even asked me how the day went I said it was rough. They said everyone was having a rough time and that they were getting Starbucks to cheer them up. We actually had a break in customers the last 15 mins and could have gotten a lot done. But we had to serve hotel staff instead after a really long, tough, busy day. 

At this point I’m just not sure how to address this or if anything will happen if I do. Staff are encouraged to order even more because of a massive discount and while we also get the same discount, it’s not a reasonable trade off in my opinion and hinders us more than it’s a benefit. We’re treated like we have to be everyone’s chipper positive robot personal coffee assistant. Most of them don’t tip and the higher ups who don’t understand how hard this job is get free drinks. 
 
We deal with a lot at this location, I don’t really need to go on about it, but I just don’t know if it’s my bitterness and exhaustion clouding my judgement or if my feelings on this are justified. ",1,1752416340.0,starbucksbaristas,0,1.0,False
1lytwu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JEENEETards/comments/1lytwu0/needed_some_advice/,needed some advice,"hello , this post is something idk what to say but i was trying to figure out what life is, for me till 5 life for me was simple, playing in streets no study stress, from 1st class my mom started teaching me for 1-2 hour and i used to get rank 1 , 2 ,3 for type and saw my elder sister struggle and i made fun of her that she cant even do this that, in 4th -5th the only thing i cried for was ki mujhe school council mein lo , lmao, and stress free life and things going decent, then 6th mein thori padhai badhi and 7th , 8th lockdown hua and it was like i was staying at home and 9th mein mene aakash join karlia tha online and i stayed away from socials in 9th and mene ek class skip bhi kari thi to i had no friend in 9th to mein ekdam sub bacho se anjan tha, so i missed the pre teen era and how people are like in pre teen , vohi 13-14 saal ke bache and unki nibbi sigma chad harkate,mein padhai karta tha and lockdown mein ghar par family sath time spend karta raha, not made any socials and used to play minecraft and roblox a lot and watch youtube, ekdam chill life and fir mein jab school kam hi gaya 9th mein, 10th mein mene school jana shuru kardia and abhi bhi mein class mein kafi bolne lag gaya and friends circle bhi ban gaya altough meri class mein saare merse badhe the but abhi bhi social media nahi chalaya and meri academics kafi badhiya chal rahi thi and then in 10th ki mid mein i got feelings for a girl (elder than me) for the first time, mene uske liye social banaye, and i got into social media and mein vo bacha ban gaya jo pura din story dalta rehta , reel scroll karta rehta and ussi type so called dank humour insta par shuru huya tha usse pehle to moti se na hero se wale dance hi hote the and i fell into that dark humour, andrew tate but i got out of andrew tate in 10th end but for that instagram i wasted my half 10th and my most of the time period and insta ke karan mein delulu mein chala gaya and jo crush bas ek attraction thi vo mujhe boht badhi lagne lag gayi,(mindwash lol). to ab mein 11th mein bahar jata hoon for padhai for jee cause somehow i liked maths and since mene aakash join kiya tha 9th 10th mein to mera usme interest bhi tha, then pata nahi insta karan hi mera man nahi lagta padhai mein and merse intially april mein hi jee nahi ho raah tha and mujhe fir vo relationship wale post dikhe to mene apni crush ko confess kar diya and she rejected cause we were in diff sec to she didnt even knew me properly but then vo post aane lag gayi , boys never move on and yeh sab and i was manupilated and mere dost bhi samjhate rahe but i didnt understand it, mein padhai mein theek thak tha to meri padhai chalti rahi theek se and then 11th ended and meri theek thi and 12th mein i took a bold step of throwing my phone and laptop and switch to nokia considering that i used laptop 24 7 and till now in 11th for me life was winning her and i used to study with her as a motivation quite lame and then 12th mein main serious hogya thora sa and starting was going good, i forgot to mention i deleted my social in between permanently so i lost contact of her updates and uski photo mein memory card mein dal li thi keypad wale mein and then mera 12th mein halka downfall hua though mein kafi padh raha tha acc to me but mein kam padh raha tha and family pressure aaya, then july mein thora up hua and august mein ganda downfall fir due to so many silly mistakes and it always looked like a excuse and then for a lil confidence boost mene ioqm diya sept 1st week mein and i got a score of 65+ and got lil hope in myself and fir sept mein mene socha improve karna h and from april to aug, meaning of life was chaning for me , from apr - may mein har jagah ghumta rehta and kam padhta, june to bilkul nahi padha, july mein i used to be myself realising how people are around me and tried maintaing my self respect and birthday to mein kabhi manata hi nahin to birthday par mummy papa dadu dadi didi masi mausa mamu nani ne wish kiya and 4-5 dost purane wale kyuki naye walo ko mene bataya nahi and mummy ne khane ko bheja mujhe and aug mein uska birthday aata tha to i was excited i will excel this month but i didnt, then sept mein mene achi tarah padhai kari and mere nokia mein youtube chalta tha but sim mein net nahi tha to mein pura din yaha to gaane sunta and yaha to radio sunta , 98.3 mirchi mostly and tayari karta, i cut off my contacts very much in hostel but somehow meri improvement hoti rahi and lekin fir bhi piche tha and ghar wale kehte the ki kya kar raha h beta, itni mehnat kar raha fir bhi improve nahi kar paa raha utna, but i just got a diff meaning of life, mein somehow move on hogya and halka sa pet bhar nikal raha tha , daari aagyi thi but yeh sab nahi dekh raha tha mein, mein apne dost se weekend par sim mange youtube par mango boi dekhta, ek gaana tha yahan koi nahin and heat waves in dono par pura din relate karta padhte huye and kafi improve hogya tha and at end of last test in mid oct i stood 1st in paper 1 and overall rank 2 for the first time and was so much happy and tabhi mujhe realise hua ki people love me , like they would trust me and would share things with me , even ek junior aake mere kandhe par roya bhi tha and then i felt very much good and then diwali par mein ghar gaya and these 2 months were too good for me, then mein diwali par ghar gaya and boht maze kiye and then for me life was apni padhai karo, self satisfaction, self love and family , and i made a female friend on discord back then and we bonded really good and then i went back to hostel with nokia , forgot to mention i used to vlog with my nokia and also took random photos of night and random things, nov mein i thought ki ab body par bhi dhyan dena h but 7 din baad i couldnt follow that hard routine of padhai but i got a very good habit of studying much and drinking black coffee and eating so many fruits and december mein jab test shuru hoye tu i was really doing the best of me consistenly and mein har hafte wednesday ko jaake lab mein apni discord wali friend se baat karta and i really liked it, we didnt even know how we looked but we shared that vibe and mummy se har roz achi baat hoti, family was happy too and then came january and i got back to mobile and laptop and forgot to mention from mango boi, i became addicted to channel like dank rishu and sunraybee and i used to watch them all day on my nokia while studying or listen to that ek kahani esi bhi but then i switched to mobile and i ruined my january attempt by that and due to hormonal changes and mood swings i also fought with my that female friend and things wennt( i got 99.87 in jee january attempt ik for many its gonna be very good but i didnt like it cause my preparation was so much better) boards mein bhi mene adv ka nahi padha and that time for me i had a fire to do something but too lazy to do and i wasted my whole time on youtube till mid march and then march onward mein ghar gaya to ghar ki financial condition dekh kar mei serious hogya and mummy ne kaha ki didi ka bhi tujhe hi dekhna h to mene boht padhai kari and april wala nta mc ki galti ki wajah se 99.95 tak hi rehgaya varna or upar jata , vese to i was satisfied cause i did good from my side and mummy ne result wale din pizza mangwaya mere liye as a congo, i was really hoping to do much better and at that time mein pura din padhta, teacher se doubts leta, saari assigments banata and mummy se baat karta phone par didi and ghar ke regarding and fir meri prep top par thi and then mein ek hafte pehle ghar aaya due to war and ghar par end mein utni padhai huyi nahi mersi cause of black out everyday for 3-4 days and environment nahi mila mujhe, for me life from mid march to may was ki apni life mein goal orietated raho and dost banao boht saare but main 5-6 hi banao and relationship are not worthy, altough you should get in situantionship just for fun and yehi kara mene, then adv wale din mein fumble kar gaya but managed to get a rank under 900 in jee adv and on result day family thori khush bhi thi, city mein rank 1 thi and i was somewhat happy though didnt got what i wanted, for me now life was relax now , and for future me i decided the life to go same way like i did from mid march to may because i thought it to be the best for managing social time and personal time and work, until i forgot to add one of the important chapters in it, when i faced it and it was the family relations and death when i faced such a condition, i am 16, i may live upto 70-80, my grandpa will die in 15-16 years, i have 50-60 years more to live, i realised i had my major life without him, i was just confused what is death and what is life, is there any spirit, why i am working so hard when most of the people who helped me grow would not be there with me when i am built myself at age of 55, why i fear doing some shit now at age of 16 when i have 50-60 years more to live and that shit would affect them for max 2 years, today i am with all my masi mausa and my cousins enjoying but what in future, i wont even meet them like this again but then i see my grandpa that his mom died 50 years ago and for him his family is his children and not his brother sister who live far away, i just began wondering whats the truth of life and i was just really confused and i cant explain myself properly here but i am so much confused what is purpose of life because for me my perfect meaning of life seems meaningless to me

1lytung,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhyWeAct/comments/1lytung/daily_reminder_were_all_suckers_for_a_surprise/,Daily reminder: We're all suckers for a surprise compliment 😄,"So I was waiting for my coffee at my usual spot this morning when a woman in line casually told me she loved my shoes. Didn’t think much of it in the moment, but walking back home, I realized how much that tiny comment brightened my mood. I ended up grinning like an idiot for the rest of the day. This got me thinking, why do we all seem to perk up with a small, unexpected compliment or a random act of kindness from a stranger?

Well, apparently it boils down to something called 'reciprocal altruism', which is a fancy way of saying we humans just naturally return favors. We're wired to appreciate unexpected kindness because our brains see it as a positive interaction, making us more likely to reciprocate in future situations. Plus, these kinds of interactions trigger a release of dopamine, the little chemical that makes us feel oh so good. It’s like a hit of unexpected joy that gives our brain a happiness boost!

Honestly, it's pretty neat how our brains work and it doesn't hurt to remind ourselves that tossing out a compliment or lending a helping hand can really make someone's day. So, don’t be shy – spread the love! 💖",1,1752416127.0,WhyWeAct,0,1.0,False
1lytubl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1lytubl/community_comes_with_inconvenience/,“Community comes with inconvenience”,"(30F) I’ve been diagnosed AuDHD for about a year. It helped a lot of things make sense. Although i have “friends” and “acquaintances” i always felt that 90 percent of my relationship weren’t authentically me. 

My partner and two other friends are in the 10 percent. But all 3 of them live further than 4 hours from me. 

I am trying to unlearn masking and also trying to assess relationships. 

Lately, I’ve really been thinking about the saying “Community comes with inconvenience” and while i agree, I’m starting to think it’s not the inconvenience that bothers me. It’s truly not feeling authentically connected with folx

I think I’ve kept a lot of friendships for social capital. For something to do. And for history. But also some because there was nothing wrong with the person, they’re just not authentically my cup of tea. 

For example, I’ve been hanging out with an acquaintance here and there, coffee shops and a drink or 2. They invited me to a get together with “like minded folks” however, I’m truly not as passionate or informed about this topic as i let on. I agreed to go for “community sake” even though i know this isn’t authentically my crowd. but the day of the weather was bad and i had to stay late at work. So i cancelled. 

I felt bad because “Community comes with inconvenience” but this isn’t MY community. 

I have another friend (15plus years) who on paper sounds like we align! I find myself frequently annoyed by the way she thinks about life and her codependent nature. But i can tell she thinks we are the best of friends and truly values the friendship. 

I have a very strong “picker” (pattern recognition) i know when I’m gonna vibe with partners and where it’ll go. I have the same thing with friends but i seem to ignore it to have friends. 

Anyone else understand the conundrum I’m in? I feel horrible complaining about it because so many people don’t even have acquaintances. But i really want local authentic friendships. Not just relationships that feel authentic to them but i know I’m full of shit and not as into it. I feel bad that if i stopped talking to 90 percent of the people in my life, i would miss the companionship or social life. Not the person
