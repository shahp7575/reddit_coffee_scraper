1px4jps,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1px4jps/your_experiences_with_caffeine_stimulants_vyvanse/,"Your experiences with caffeine + stimulants (vyvanse) on anxiety, especially on empty stomach and little hydration?","Howdy, German, 36y, m. Diagnosed about 1 year ago, since July on Vyvanse (or as we call it, Elvanse in Europe). I started with 20 mg, then 30, then 40 and now I have both 30 and 40 at home. I have/had some history with subclinical anxiety, no depression though (quite the contrary to be honest). 

Coffee and caffeine has been a very steady love hate relationship, quite borderline to some extent. I used to and still do drink loooots of coffee (wonder where this might come from?!) and I’m relatively confident that it played an important role in this whole anxiety issue (who might have thought??). It is fair to say that I have some form of coffee addiction and some people around me already noticed that I drink a lot and also keep asking about their consumption (which is almost always lower than mine). My father i.e. drinks one cup of coffee in the morning and one in the afternoon, occasionally one in between but it has no particular effect on him. I definitely can’t say that caffeine has no effect on me like so many others with ADHD. I have some tolerance though. 

I drink coffee quite ‘mindlessly’ and lately I drink about 3 up to 3,5 cups before noon WITH my 30 mg of Vyvanse/Elvanse in the morning. I don’t eat food and I don’t drink fluids usually before noon, so the medication and the coffee is on an empty stomach. I gotta admit, typing this I feel a little ridiculous complaining about anxiety since this is sounds probably like a “how to feel anxious in the morning” manual LOL. I don’t feel particularly anxious when the caffeine is in my system (though this happens, too), but I experience really nasty crashes. This happens especially when I overindulged some days ago. So, very oddly, my anxiety seems to be some sort of delayed ‘caffeine’ hangover. 

Any thoughts on this? Does anybody have a similar experience?

1px4hbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NightmareNarratives-/comments/1px4hbr/theres_an_old_brick_wall_behind_my_apartment_with/,"There’s an old brick wall behind my apartment with a window that shouldn’t exist. At 3 a.m., a man stands behind the glass and watches my living room, but there’s no building or room on the other side...","The wall has been there longer than the building.

That’s what the landlord told me when I moved in. Old red brick, rough and uneven, running along the back edge of the property like a boundary someone forgot to remove. My apartment backs up to it so closely that my living room window sits less than a meter away. No alley. No space. Just brick.

It’s ugly, but the rent is cheap. That’s why I’m here.

I work contract jobs. Nothing stable. Gaps between paychecks. Breaking this lease would mean sleeping in my car again, and I promised myself I wouldn’t do that another winter. So I stay. I keep my head down. I don’t complain.

The wall was never an issue at first.

No graffiti. No noise. No movement. Just brick and mortar and the occasional spider web catching moonlight. I barely noticed it anymore, which is probably why it took me a few weeks to realize something was wrong.

It started with the reflection.

One night, a little after 3 a.m., I was sitting on the couch scrolling through my phone, lights off except for the TV glow. I glanced toward the window out of habit, expecting to see my own reflection layered over the dark glass.

Instead, I saw a room.

Not my living room. A different one.

It was faint. Barely there. Like a reflection that didn’t quite line up with reality. A pale square of light where only brick should have been.

I leaned closer.

The image vanished.

I chalked it up to exhaustion. I’d been sleeping badly for months. Stress does weird things to your eyes. Makes shadows look intentional.

The next night, I saw it again.

Clearer this time.

A window.

Rectangular. Old glass, slightly warped. Set directly into the brick wall behind my apartment.

That shouldn’t be possible.

There’s no space back there. No building. No room. The wall is solid. I’ve touched it. I’ve leaned ladders against it. There’s nowhere a window could belong.

Still, there it was.

And behind the glass, someone was standing.

A man.

He didn’t move. Didn’t press his face to the window. Just stood there in the dim light, hands at his sides, head slightly tilted.

Watching my living room.

I froze.

The rational part of my brain tried to take control immediately. Reflection. Old glass playing tricks. A neighbor’s light bouncing at the wrong angle.

But reflections don’t look back at you.

I took a step closer.

The man’s eyes followed me.

I backed away so fast I nearly tripped over the coffee table. When I looked again, the window was gone.

Just brick.

Cold. Flat. Unbroken.

I didn’t sleep after that.

The next morning, I went outside and examined the wall in daylight. No outline. No seam. No sign of glass or framing. Just solid brickwork, patched and repointed decades ago.

I asked the landlord about it later that week, trying to sound casual.

“There’s no structure behind the wall, right?” I asked.

He frowned. “Never has been. That wall used to be the back of something a long time ago. Got sealed off.”

“Sealed off from what?”

He shrugged. “Old city stuff. Don’t worry about it.”

That should have been enough.

It wasn’t.

At exactly 3:00 a.m. the next night, the window came back.

This time, the man was closer to the glass.

I could see more detail. His face was thin. Colorless. His clothes looked outdated. Not old-fashioned exactly. Just wrong. Like they belonged to a time that didn’t exist anymore.

He smiled when he saw me notice him.

Not wide. Not threatening.

Expectant.

I turned on every light in the apartment. The window vanished instantly.

I didn’t sit in the dark after that. I kept the lights on. Kept busy. Told myself that if it was some weird optical illusion, it needed darkness to work.

At 3:00 a.m. the following night, the window appeared anyway.

The lights didn’t matter.

The man raised his hand.

And slowly, carefully, he tapped the glass.

Once.

Twice.

Three times.

The sound didn’t come from outside.

It came from inside my apartment.

Right behind me.

I spun around so fast my neck popped.

Nothing was there.

My living room was exactly how I’d left it. Couch. Coffee table. TV paused on a dim screen. The front door locked. The hallway dark and empty.

But the tapping continued.

Three slow knocks.

Not on the window.

On the inside of the wall.

Directly behind where the couch sat.

I backed away until my calves hit the armrest. The sound wasn’t loud. It wasn’t aggressive. That was the worst part. Whoever was making it wasn’t trying to get my attention.

They already had it.

I pressed my ear to the wall.

The brick should have been cold. Solid. Dead.

Instead, it was faintly warm.

I pulled back like it burned me.

The tapping stopped.

When I looked at the window again, the man was still there. Closer now. Close enough that I could see imperfections in the glass. Tiny bubbles. Warping that bent the edges of his face slightly, stretching his smile just enough to make it feel intentional.

He raised his hand again.

This time, he didn’t tap.

He rested his palm against the glass.

I did the same without thinking.

The glass fogged under his hand.

So did the wall under mine.

That was when I noticed the room behind him wasn’t empty.

There was furniture. Old, mismatched pieces. A chair pulled back from a table. A lamp casting weak yellow light. Dust hanging in the air like it hadn’t been disturbed in years.

It looked lived in.

Occupied.

He leaned closer to the glass, his breath clouding it.

“I can see you better now,” he said.

The sound didn’t travel through the window.

It came from the wall.

I staggered back and grabbed my phone. Full signal. No missed calls. No notifications. I tried to record video.

The screen showed nothing.

Just brick.

No window. No man. No light.

When I lowered the phone, the window was still there.

He watched me fumble with it, amused.

“You don’t remember,” he said.

“Remember what?” My voice sounded thin even to me.

“When this was my side.”

The lights in my apartment flickered.

For a split second, the layout of my living room felt wrong. Walls stretching too far. Corners rounding where they shouldn’t. The smell changed. Old wood. Damp plaster.

I saw it then.

Not clearly. Not fully.

Another version of my apartment, overlapping this one. Older. Smaller. Cramped. The brick wall wasn’t a wall there.

It was an interior divider.

The window wasn’t facing outside.

It was facing another room.

His room.

I slammed my back against the opposite wall, heart hammering. “There’s nothing back there,” I said. “I checked.”

He nodded slowly. “There wasn’t anything on your side either. Not at first.”

The tapping started again.

Not from one place.

From multiple points along the wall.

Soft. Patient. Like fingers testing for thin spots.

I realized then why it always happened at 3 a.m.

The city was quiet. Traffic gone. Power usage low. The building settled into itself, old materials relaxing just enough.

The wall was weakest then.

The man’s smile widened.

“I’m almost through,” he said. “You’ve been standing in my living room for weeks.”

A thin line appeared in the brick.

Not a crack.

A seam.

Perfectly straight. Vertical. As if something invisible was being slid aside from the other end.

I grabbed my keys and ran.

I didn’t turn off the lights. Didn’t lock the door. I bolted down the stairs and didn’t stop until I hit the street, lungs burning, head spinning.

I slept in my car that night.

At 3 a.m., my phone buzzed.

No caller ID.

Just a text.

You left the window open.

I didn’t look back at the building.

But I knew.

I knew the wall was thinner now.

And I knew he wasn’t watching my living room anymore.

He was waiting for me to come home.

I didn’t go back the next day.

Or the day after that.

I told my boss I was sick. Then I told him my car broke down. Then I stopped answering altogether. I slept in parking lots and rest stops, waking up every hour to check the time, my heart racing every time it crept close to 3 a.m.

Nothing happened the first two nights.

No texts. No tapping. No sense of being watched.

That almost convinced me I’d imagined it.

Almost.

On the third night, I dreamed of the wall.

Not the brick side. The other side.

I was standing in a narrow room lit by a single lamp. The air felt stale, thick with dust that coated my tongue when I breathed. The furniture was old and mismatched, exactly like I’d seen through the window. A chair pulled back from a small table. A couch positioned too close to the wall.

My couch.

I stepped toward the wall and pressed my hand against it.

It wasn’t brick.

It was drywall.

Thin. Flexible.

Warm.

Something pressed back.

I woke up choking, my palm burning where it had touched the steering wheel.

At 2:59 a.m., my phone buzzed.

A voicemail.

No number. No duration listed.

I didn’t open it. I didn’t need to.

The notification disappeared on its own at exactly 3:01.

That morning, exhaustion finally beat fear. I needed a shower. Clean clothes. A real bed. I told myself I’d grab my things and leave for good. I wouldn’t stay the night. I wouldn’t sit in the living room. I wouldn’t look at the wall.

I’d be in and out.

The building looked the same as always. Quiet. Normal. A few cars in the lot. Curtains drawn. Nothing out of place.

Inside my apartment, the air smelled wrong.

Not rotten. Not musty.

Lived-in.

The couch cushions were slightly indented. The coffee table had a faint ring where a mug had been set down. The TV remote was on the armrest instead of the table where I always left it.

I stood in the doorway, keys still in my hand, telling myself I’d done this. That I was misremembering.

Then I heard the chair.

Scraping softly.

From behind the wall.

Not dragging anymore.

Adjusting.

I didn’t look at the window.

I didn’t need to.

“I fixed it while you were gone,” the man’s voice said calmly. “It was easier once you stopped resisting.”

The lights flickered.

The wall rippled.

Not cracked. Not broke.

Rippled, like fabric being shaken out.

I backed toward the door, but the knob wouldn’t turn. It wasn’t locked. It just… refused. Like it no longer belonged to me.

“You kept coming into my place,” he continued. “Standing where my furniture should be. Watching through my window.”

My stomach dropped.

The room felt smaller now. The ceiling lower. The corners tighter.

“I waited years,” he said. “Then you moved in.”

The wall began to thin.

I could see shapes behind it. Furniture outlines bleeding through. The faint glow of that weak yellow lamp.

Then the window appeared.

Not behind the wall.

In it.

Embedded halfway through, glass bulging inward, frame fused with brick and drywall both.

He was inches from me now.

Not separated by glass.

Separated by habit.

“You don’t need to leave anymore,” he said gently. “You already live here.”

My phone vibrated in my pocket.

One last text.

3:00 a.m.

The wall sighed.

And something shifted, slow and deliberate, as if two rooms were finally agreeing on where the boundary should be.

I don’t remember the wall breaking.

There was no crash. No shower of bricks. No noise you could point to and say that’s when it happened.

It was more like a decision being made.

The room shrank in a way that didn’t involve movement. The air thickened. The smell of old dust and stale warmth replaced the clean, empty scent I’d grown used to. I felt pressure in my ears, like descending too fast in an elevator.

The window finished forming.

Not pushing through the wall anymore. Not halfway between spaces.

It settled.

Perfectly flush. As if it had always been there.

The man stepped back on his side and gestured politely, palm up, inviting me to look. I didn’t want to, but my eyes moved anyway.

The living room behind him was mine.

Not similar. Not close.

Mine.

Same couch. Same coffee table. Same scuffed spot on the floor where I’d dropped a pan weeks earlier. But everything looked… older. Slightly warped. Like a memory that had been lived in too long.

“You see it now,” he said. “We’ve been sharing it.”

The wall was gone.

Not removed. Reassigned.

Where brick had been, there was drywall. Where drywall had been, there was brick. The apartment no longer had a clear edge. My living room flowed into his the way rooms do in old houses that were remodeled badly, doorways added where none should exist.

I staggered back and hit the couch.

It dipped under my weight.

So did the one behind him.

We both looked down.

The cushions compressed in perfect sync.

His smile finally broke into something like relief.

“That was the hard part,” he said. “Getting it to line up.”

My phone buzzed.

No signal. No bars. Still, the screen lit up.

A notification from my landlord.

Lease Update Available

Before I could stop myself, I opened it.

The address was the same.

The unit number wasn’t.

What used to be listed as Rear Unit – 1B now read:

Interior Unit – Shared

Occupants:
— [My name]
— [Name Unavailable]

I backed away, shaking my head. “I’m leaving.”

He nodded. “You tried that.”

I turned for the door.

It was still there. Same frame. Same handle.

But when I opened it, I didn’t see the hallway.

I saw brick.

Solid. Unbroken.

The same wall I’d stared at for months.

Except this time, there was no window.

Not on my side.

“Doors are like windows,” he said gently. “They only work if both sides agree.”

Behind me, a chair scraped.

Not dragged.

Pulled into place.

I felt the couch shift as someone sat down beside me.

The cushion dipped. Warmth spread through the fabric.

I didn’t turn my head.

Outside, somewhere far away, traffic passed. People slept. The city kept time without me.

At 3:01 a.m., the window faded.

At 3:02, the wall finished settling.

By morning, the apartment was quiet again.

Normal.

Too normal.

When the landlord came by later that week, she frowned at the layout. Said she didn’t remember the living room being so deep. Asked if I’d moved the furniture.

I said no.

She nodded and left.

At night, I still sit on the couch.

Sometimes I feel the cushion dip beside me.

Sometimes I hear a chair scrape softly, just behind the wall that shouldn’t exist.

I don’t look anymore.

Because I’ve started to understand something.

The man isn’t watching me through the window now.

He doesn’t need to.

From his side, this has always been his apartment.

And every night at 3 a.m., when the building goes quiet and the walls relax, I feel him settle in comfortably and watch the only strange thing left in the room.

1px4ghj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1px4ghj/i_need_urgent_help/,I need urgent help,"So, I’m in college and there’s this guy I’ve had two classes with a year apart (one in spring 2024 and one in spring 2025). In our spring 2024 class, we shared a couple stares and I thought maybe he thought I was cute or something. Anyway, early this year around like February my suspicions kinda came true bc he followed me on Instagram. 

After that we didn’t talk until the beginning of May as classes were coming to an end. We chatted a little bit, but got separated quickly. Anyway, he ended up DMing me saying he thought I was cute and would like to get to know me. He then asked for my Snapchat and after we basically talked everyday throughout the summer. 

The thing is, we probably would have hung out in the summer if not for the fact that he lives across the country in Cali. So, he left the same week we started talking. Anyway, all this to say he came back at the end of August and the same day he got back, we accidentally ran into each other at Walmart. We walked around and talked for a while (he was helping me shop since he was only there for one thing). We were then interrupted as his ride had arrived, but he asked me out for coffee. We planned a date on Saturday, which was about a week away. 

We still talked throughout the week, then we got to Friday and I was at work that afternoon when he texted me asking if I wanted to out that night instead. Well, since I was going to be home until around 10 I asked if Saturday was still alright. He said yes and the next morning I started getting ready, then it began to downpour and he asked to reschedule. A week later I hadn’t heard from him since he cancelled, I asked if he was still down to get the coffee, he said he been busy but yes and we again planned for that weekend. 

Since I had reached out to him, I figured I let him reached out that time. Well, the Saturday we had planned, he hadn’t reached out. After that, I hadn’t heard from him in months so I moved on with my life. 

Then, Christmas Eve rolls around and he texts me apologizing (he’s in Cali celebrating with his family). He said something around the lines of, “I would like to apologize for never getting around about us hanging out. I was busy, then everything went sideways and I was wondering if you would still be up to talking to me.” I said, “it’s alright, I was busy as well, but yes I’d still be up to talking”So, we began talking and pretty quickly he said he’d be back on campus on the 28th (tomorrow) and asked if I would like to hang out. I said sure. 

Now, here comes the issue, my mom thinks I’m being too easy and thinks that I’m his second choice. She never liked him from the moment I told her about him (even though she’s never met him) bc he plays hockey for our school. 

So what do you think? Am I being too easy?

But it proved something: If expense tracking depends on motivation, it fails.

**The origin of Qrosh:**

Before Qrosh was an app, I was basically using ChatGPT as my tracker. I’d just message: “I spent £12 on coffee” “Groceries were £43” “Uber was £9”

That habit turned into **Qrosh AI**, an expense tracker that:

* lets you log expenses with voice (no typing)
* understands any language so you speak naturally
* gives weekly reports so you see where your money actually goes

**The Problem (Even after adding):**

* budgets
* subscription tracking
* better UX

I still wasn’t consistent. Because it still relied on me remembering.

**What I just shipped:**

An **Apple Pay Shortcut integration** for Qrosh AI.

* Apple Pay transaction happens
* automation sends it to Qrosh
* it gets logged as an expense

Basically: **Apple Pay → expense log, automatically.** Shipped it in 1 day because I needed tracking to feel hands off.

1px4ev4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1px4ev4/open_source_maintainers_how_did_you_successfully/,Open source maintainers: How did you successfully grow your GitHub Sponsors?,"Hi open source community!

As a developer maintaining several open source projects (you can check my work at https://github.com/DhanushNehru), I'm looking for advice on growing sponsorships. I currently have a few sponsors which I'm incredibly grateful for, but I'm trying to increase support as the projects grow and costs are rising.

**What I've tried so far:**

• Improved my GitHub Sponsors page to clearly communicate the value and impact
• Mentioned sponsors in release notes and project updates
• Added a sponsors section in README files across repositories
• Gently suggested sponsorship to appreciative users in issues when appropriate
• Highlighted how sponsorships help maintain and improve the projects

**What's working (somewhat):**
I do get occasional sponsors, which is amazing and keeps me motivated. However, as the projects gain momentum and more users rely on them, the associated time I spend on project are increasing faster than sponsorships.

**What I haven't tried yet:**
• Adding alternative sponsorship platforms ( Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee)
• Creating sponsor tiers with specific goals/benefits

**What I'm NOT willing to do:**
• Be pushy or annoying about it

**Questions for the community:**

1. **Do you sponsor open source projects?** If yes, what made you decide to sponsor? Was it the project's value, the maintainer's communication, specific benefits, or something else?

2. **As a user, how do you prefer to be asked for sponsorship?** What feels genuine vs. what feels like begging?

3. **What are subtle, respectful ways to communicate the need for sponsorships** without making users feel guilty or pressured?

4. **Should I expand to multiple sponsorship platforms** or keep it simple with just GitHub Sponsors?

5. **Am I missing something important** that other projects are doing successfully?

I love building open source software and helping the community, but sustainability is becoming a real concern. Any insights from maintainers who've successfully grown their sponsorships, or from sponsors who can share what motivated them, would be incredibly helpful.

Thanks in advance! 🙏

Any advice?,"I recently bought a Black+Decker drip coffee machine and was really excited to try it out. I’ve mostly been an instant coffee and South Indian filter coffee drinker, so this is my first experience with drip-style brewing.

Unfortunately, I made a beginner mistake while ordering coffee. I bought Blue Tokai Vienna Roast (home espresso) and only later realised it’s a fine espresso grind instead of the medium grind recommended for drip machines.

Before I mess things up completely, I wanted to ask:

	•	Is there any safe way to use espresso-fine grounds in a drip machine?

	•	Or is it better to avoid it altogether and get the correct grind? ",1,1766859045.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False
1px4doi,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1px4doi/eff_christmas/,Eff Christmas,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I will prep this by saying this is a long one. I’m not sure I will even post this. I think I just need to get some thoughts off my chest. I hate Christmas, and this years Christmas only reinforced that. 

My wife and I have five children ranging from lower elementary to newborn. Christmas is already a rough time of year for me. I grew up in a household with lots of financial stress, a passive-aggressive mother with bipolar depression who made anything you asked for seem like a tremendous financial burden, and a grandmother that made Christmas really special who died in front of me shortly after Christmas when I was in middle school. I’m also ADHD and struggle with both the social demands of the holiday season and the overstimulating environments. That said, Christmas isn’t about me, it’s about her and the kids, and I don’t want them to have the same feelings and experiences that I did. I made all of our holiday decorations custom to her specifications- wreaths, garlands, etc., and hang them each year so the house is the Christmas wonderland she wants it to be for the children, because I don’t want Christmas for them to be what it is for me. I’d like to pretend that my wife and I are equal partners in our marriage, but the reality is that she leads in some areas and I lead in others and together we accomplish everything that needs to be done. We work opposite schedules where I’m home with the youngest kids during the week while she works, and then I work the weekend while she’s home with all 5. In that sense we “split” the child care, but she is the one who makes sure they have clothes and friends and things that interest them and stokes their social and intellectual needs. This is especially true at Christmas as she collects the details on what the kids want and makes sure they have it. She’s a really great mom and I’m glad I have her. On the flip side, I do 100% of the grocery shopping and cooking for the family, there is no food that goes into the mouths of anyone in our household that I didn’t plan for, purchase, pick up, prep, cook, plate, and clean up after. I even prep and freeze breakfasts and make leftover plates for everyone to eat when I’m working. 100% of the meal planning, monitoring of inventory for household goods, and all of the dishes/clean up after meals is my responsibility. We both run laundry every day, I run linens during the week, we both clean bathrooms each week, we both vacuum every day, and I handle the big cleaning tasks like mopping, rug cleaning, stains of all description, baseboard cleaning, deep cleaning tasks, etc. I’m 100% guilty of relying on her to keep the house organized, and I have been chewed out more than once for putting the wrong clothing in the wrong drawer or forgetting to finish putting the laundry up, but I try and I probably get 90% right, it’s not a weaponized incompetence scenario. I know the mental load with kids is larger, I’m just trying to illustrate that I’m not another child for her to raise, we each play to our strengths. 

Christmas Eve, my wife and I host her family every year. My wife doesn’t cook or grocery shop, so I bought and prepared a couple dips, made some charcuterie boards, and made a soup for everyone, as is our typical custom. After everyone had eaten, I start clearing and cleaning, because I know I have children’s presents to put together later in the evening and don’t want to waste any time so that I can be in bed at a reasonable hour. My wife is enjoying a glass of wine with my MIL so I get the kids all ready for bed and get everyone tucked in, except the big kids who still need to put out cookies and reindeer food. After big kids are in bed, I start putting together presents that Santa brought and disposing of the evidence (because the big kid will immediately start questioning things if he finds boxes for the things they’re opening “From Santa” in the garage). I cannot take credit for anything that the kids got; with the exception of one kid gift that I bought and picked up, my wife ordered everything for the kids. By 10 PM she was already asleep, while I was up until 12:30 AM putting toys together, scavenging batteries for the battery operated toys, making sure rechargeable toys were charged and ready, and hiding all the evidence. Naturally, at 6:45 Christmas morning, when the 2 oldest kids run in, I’m a little groggy and disoriented, but I get up and get moving with everyone else, feed the dogs, and get the oven preheating and the coffee rolling. I immediately receive several snippy comments about my grogginess, and when I explain how late I was up get snapped at some more about “what took me so long”, which doesn’t help my mood or the negative feelings I have about Christmas. We get our toddler up and let the newborns sleep, then start preparing to open gifts. The toddler (my best friend) immediately decides that she wants no part of the gift opening and begins screaming  to get down and roam, so she and I walk through the main area of the house and try to stay entertained as big kids open gifts. I miss all of them opening, but I wanted the wife to enjoy this part anyway since she did all the hard work. Eventually, I get the toddler to engage with her new toys and get to give my wife her presents. She’s rushing me the entire time because she has to start getting ready to go to her parents, and we have to get all the kids ready etc etc. She had sent a list that I followed to a T, and Santa brought her some surprises on top. I really hate asking for gifts, so when she asked what I wanted and then suggested something (a family skylight calendar) I said yes and then suggested that all I really wanted was her (IYKWIM). My basic issue with gifts is that I buy what I need when I need it if I can afford it, and if I can’t afford it I don’t want to ask for it. I feel guilty asking for things even though it’s Christmas and getting gifts is expected. I did want the skylight calendar, because my wife currently uses paper calendars on the fridge and I hate that I can’t check them from anywhere in the world, so I am super grateful and excited for that gift. I did also suggest that I wanted to save up for a new toolbox/rolling workbench, as mine is overflowing with tools that I’ve acquired through the years. This is too expensive to ask any one person for, so if any of her family asked her what I wanted, gift cards to go towards that were the perfect thing. That being said, I open my gifts. Bag number 1 has a lingerie set in it, so she caught the hint and I’m grateful, but I’m also a little annoyed because I got this same gift (different lingerie set) in my stocking 3 christmases ago and I never saw it again despite hinting that it should get worn at some point once or twice a year, so we’ve done this trope before. We have 3 kids under 2y, so like, I’m obviously not deprived, and I don’t want to sound ungrateful, because my wife is super hot and amazing and I’m into her, but like I’m never going to ask her to wear it because that’s awkward and makes me feel weird and she’s never going to volunteer to wear it, so it’s a waste if that makes sense? Also, 5 kids, so when we’re not busy chasing several of them, she’s understandably tired, so we aren’t putting on a show and that’s fine also. Yes, we need a trip away, this summer makes XX years, maybe we’ll do that, but let’s be practical here. I also get some shirts and a jacket from a clothing maker I like, which is great because I don’t buy myself clothes, I just forcibly retire them when they get too old and acquire new ones. I’m happy. The wife starts her 2 hour getting ready procedure to go to the in-laws and I start getting kids dressed and ready, feed them breakfast, feed infants, make bottles for the day, etc. I jump in the shower real quick once she’s mostly ready and get out and put comfortable clothes on, to which I immediately get fussed at. Apparently this isn’t a casual situation, I need to be picture ready, which is fine, I’m easy, I just wish she had communicated what was in her head ahead of time instead of flying off the handle at my shorts and t-shirt. I change into jeans and a polo in under 90 seconds and we’re good. Note that it’s 9:40 AM, the in-laws live 5 minutes away, we were asked to come at 10:00 AM and my wife is losing her mind huffing and stomping around about everyone “not having been ready,” which they all were except one needed her hair brushed (the wife won’t let me brush and style it because she wants to control it), the oldest whose belt isn’t tucked in correctly (3 second fix), and the toddler needed a bow and shoes (which I intentionally didn’t put on because they immediately get ripped out/off and thrown lord knows where, so that’s a last minute thing anyway). We finish getting kids ready, and I get chewed out again because I didn’t pull the pack and play while she was getting ready (heavy attitude: “I ASSUMED this was done already.”). In my defense it was on the list but wasn’t my highest priority and could wait until she was done so I had someone to help run interference with the kids. I load all the kids in the car, make a coffee with lots of Bailey’s and bourbon because I know I’m about to be overstimulated AF and this will dull the edges some, and we head to the in-laws. Naturally, we’re the first ones there at 9:50 AM. We set up the pack and play and infant beds in an upstairs bedroom and the wife puts the littles to sleep immediately. My wife places me in charge of the toddler. That’s fine, she’s my favorite and I’m her favorite, so it works out. I realize I never ate breakfast, have a cinnamon roll with the toddler, we color some, I sip on my drink, we hang out for almost an hour before my wife’s sibling shows up. The wife places a highchair in the living room to contain the toddler while presents are being opened. To set the scene: the living room is pretty cramped: 1 couch, 2 chairs and a love seat plus 7 adults, 2 school age children, 2 toddlers, and a baby (1 toddler and 1 baby belong to the sister-in-law). On top of this cacophony, my father-in-law insists on blaring Christmas music while everyone opens presents each year. I think he’s a little hard of hearing so for him it’s not noticeably loud. I’m overstimulated AF. My toddler is also overstimulated and immediately starts screaming. I try some pivots to help her, she won’t stop screaming, so I remove her to the kitchen, put on some Sesame Street, go back to coloring. Nothing helps much until I realize it’s her morning nap time and this is likely just inevitable, so I take her upstairs and try to put her down in the pack and play, but she starts screaming and threatening to wake the youngest 2 as soon as she touches down in the pack and play. So I wind up spending about 30 minutes rocking with her and singing to her until she falls asleep and I escape. I come downstairs to everyone being done and gone basically and 2 presents and my stocking sitting on my spot, which is fine. The first I open is a roasting pan and dish towels from my wife’s grandmother. It’s fine, she’s on a fixed income and even though it’s things I don’t need or want (kitchen towels that don’t match my wife’s decor and a roasting pan I’ll never use), it’s the thought that counts, so I make sure to tell her thank you and move on. The second gift is a knife block and set of kitchen knives. I’m not enthralled but I’m polite and say thank you and fake enthusiasm. My wife then turns and rudely asks where I went when everyone was opening gifts, I explain that I was putting toddler down, and she says “I don’t understand what took you so long to just put her down.” I explained the issue with her screaming and needing to be rocked first and my MIL comes to my defense. At this point I’m just pissed off, fuck Christmas, I hate everything about this, but I’m not going to show my ass to my in-laws or ruin anyone else’s good time, so I excuse myself and go outside where the kids are playing and sit on the porch to watch them and drink my coffee. I get a rude text from my wife that says “so can you not just go be by yourself wtf” which I ignore. She’s PMSing and drinking wine, I am just trying to stay away. She comes out and starts asking what I’m doing and I told her I was staying away from her because I don’t appreciate being talked to like a piece of shit in front of her entire family. She rolls her eyes and storms away and I spend the rest of the day avoiding making her mad and playing with the kids. I socialize with a few other family members throughout the day, take care of the littles, and generally just try to keep my head down. We finally leave around bedtime and I speed run through unloading the car while the wife organizes gifts into piles and then I get kids in bed while my wife eats leftover gumbo because I have work in the morning and am tired. Cut to the day after Christmas, I get home from work and start unpacking and putting away my stack of gifts; clothes in the hamper, roasting pan and towels in the donate/regift cabinet, knife block out. I already own a set of knives that I love, but since my MIL is at my house weekly I feel like I have to put hers out and pretend to love them. My wife says “oh wow, don’t you love your new knives?” to which I respond honestly: I don’t love them. She asks why. “Well, they’re cheap low grade Indian steel, they’re dull right out of the box, the handles are chunky and uncomfortable to hold, the shears are flimsy, etc.” I made a joke about getting a regift, which my wife and MIL are both guilty of, to which my wife gets offended and says “no, I told her you’d like a new knife set.” I just stand there dumbfounded. I have told my wife EVERY YEAR that I hate getting kitchen stuff for Christmas because my MIL always buys me some random kitchen things she thinks I’ll like that never gets used or winds up regifted. This started when I asked for a stand mixer I needed and a cookbook I wanted one year and never stopped. I’ve made the joke plenty of times “buying me kitchenware is the equivalent of buying my wife a new washing machine for Christmas because she washes clothes.” Truthfully, my wife is annoyed by our old knife set because the kids have thrown away several steak knives and most recently lost the kitchen shears and she thinks that it looks bad, so I suspect that she really just wanted a new knife set and suggested it to my MIL for this reason. I have never expressed an interest in replacing our knives. Now I’m just conflicted. I’m mad about the knives, but I feel guilty for being ungrateful. I’m mad that my wife suggested this, knowing how I feel about getting kitchenwares for Christmas, but it’s also my fault for not having a bulleted list of exactly what I wanted, so I feel like I can’t complain. I know a she has enough of a load taking care of the children’s Christmas wishes without thinking about mine, but I wish she had put just a modicum of thought into it. I said gift cards, and even beyond that, our shared Amazon cart is full of saved for laters that I couldn’t justify buying for myself, you couldn’t have picked any of those instead of this knife set? I already hated Christmas, my wife knows why, but still felt it was appropriate to talk to me like a piece of shit all day? She didn’t speak to me again last night after the knife incident. I know that the end result of all of this is going to be me just sucking it up and moving on but I’m so mad and hurt and ashamed. I know the advice is going to be to talk to her about it but I don’t want to. It’s just going to wind up being another fight, either I’m ungrateful or I’m rude because I went outside or I’m a piece of shit because I didn’t do this one thing or I should have made a list. I’ve said it directly enough times. I shouldn’t have to tell her why this sucks. And I don’t want to whine to her about it. I’m just frustrated. ",1,1766859018.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Birthday: December 9, 2000

Race: Elf & Demon Tribes / Japanese

Role: The Agent Slasher Princess of Micro City, Cyber X Unit Squad Member

Alignment: Anti-Hero

Residence: Micro City (Apex World)

😈 Personality:

Cirnira Korana is stealthy, extremely calm, and highly skilled in combat, with an incredible battle IQ. She enjoys torturing her opponents in a composed and unsettling way, can sense fear, and loves making enemies nervous and afraid. She finds it cute when speaking to shy or worried people and is joyful and relaxed around her allies.
She has a soft, smooth voice and often acts playful, lively, and lustful toward both enemies and allies, sometimes just to amuse herself. Cirnira can sense enemies from far distances or when they are nearby. She loves darkness more than mornings, hates boredom, and enjoys conversations. She is excellent at saving others but craves blood when absorbing it through her tail, blushing if she consumes too much. Despite her cruelty in battle, she never underestimates her opponents and has a known weakness to poison-based abilities.

🍓 Food & Drinks:

Water, coffee, blood, salad, spaghetti, macaroni, devil’s food cake (birthday), sprinkle cake pop, fried rice, teriyaki chicken, strawberries, peaches, grapes, shokupan, sausage, scrambled eggs, cinnamon French toast.

🕳️ Powers & Abilities:

Raze Yarnova Ultra Waves (Special Move):Cirnira unleashes devastating nail-based strikes and massive dark waves that slice through anything, including hybrids and humans. This attack erases regeneration and immortality, has unlimited speed, never misses, and slows an opponent’s attacks before they can even strike.

Blood Chi-Naria (Special Move):Cirnira manipulates her blood to unleash millions of sharp blood stabs that cause extreme damage, erase regeneration and immortality, slow defenses, and increase speed when struck by enemy abilities. It can trap opponents in blood, rip into their skin, cause unbearable pain, prevent escape, and reverse attacks if resisted.

Chi-Naria Dark Rebound (Special Move):Every dodge activates a dark rebound that reflects attacks back at the opponent. It grants powerful protection, absorbs abilities, cannot be erased, canceled, or copied, and never misses since it is part of her body.

Dark Wisp U-Death:By whispering softly, Cirnira inflicts extreme pain without physical contact. If an opponent uses a powerful move, she can steal it, reflect it back, and kill them. This ability can copy, cancel, or inflict massive damage by striking the heart with summoned shadows.

Max Speed:Cirnira possesses unlimited speed and sensing, allowing her to dodge any attack effortlessly. Her movement causes enemies to become dizzy and lose concentration, and her high-speed kicks can leave opponents unable to recover easily.

Strikes-CO-Punch:She delivers millions of punches in one second, each strike carrying approximately 700,000,000,000 force, disrupting enemy movements, powers, and abilities.

Infinite Regeneration:Cirnira regenerates infinitely, and her regeneration accelerates rapidly when consuming blood.

Body Resistance:She is unaffected by steel-based abilities, resists time manipulation, power suppression, dark attacks, copying abilities, reversals, reflections, erasure, and canceling powers, often absorbing them instead.

Tail Absorb:Cirnira stabs opponents with her tail to absorb their blood, enhancing her speed, defense, and attack power. She can release blood as a feint to bait enemies into attacking.

Dark Soul Speed Slash:Moving at light speed, Cirnira delivers dark slashes that affect the soul, erase regeneration, disrupt surroundings, destroy illusions, and dismantle enemy powers before they strike.

Tarian Heart Blast:She fires blood-based attacks from her hands that stab opponents, induce heart attacks, cause fatal hallucinations, disrupt heart rhythms, immobilize targets, and shut down body movement.

🤝 Relationships:

Birince (Boss / Respect):Cirnira deeply respects Birince and sees him as serious with a hidden soft side, though she finds him loud due to his hatred toward demon kitsune foxes.

Marcaline (Best Friend / Rival):Despite Marcaline being a demon kitsune fox, Cirnira enjoys talking with her, admires her strength and personality, and is never bothered by their rivalry.

Lewtaro (Good Friendship):Cirnira enjoys Lewtaro’s company, discusses new move ideas with him, and often teases him in a lustful, joking way to make him blush.

Dara (Okay Friendship):She finds Dara cute and kind and loves her personality, but becomes quiet and uneasy when witnessing her demon form.

Poduos (Okay Friendship):Cirnira sees Poduos as a powerful ally within the Cyber X Unit Squad and feels comfortable around him despite his serious combat nature.

J (Neutral):She views J as a strange yet powerful human, never underestimating him. She finds his trash-talking funny and occasionally feels like punching him for it.

🌑 Summary Overview:

Cirnira Korana, known as the Agent Slasher Princess of Micro City, is one of the most powerful women in the Cyber X Unit Squad. Born as an elf with hidden demon blood, she grew up unaware of her mother’s true nature, only knowing her father as a normal elf. This discovery led to difficult times as she struggled to control her dark, lethal powers.
Her abilities were capable of killing instantly, forcing her to train under the Cyber X Unit Agency in Micro City. Through years of discipline, Cirnira learned to control her power and use it for both good and evil. Though playful, lustful, and terrifying in battle, she remains a protector who saves others without hesitation. When darkness falls, Cirnira emerges from the shadows, unleashing her brutal justice and solidifying her legend within the Apex World.

We'd only been together for a few months and I would come to bed naked and he wouldn't even look up from his phone. And not just in bed. In moments where we could have been flirting, kissing, connecting... in the kitchen... eating breakfast together... sitting on the couch... having our coffee. So many missed opportunities to create sensual energy or sexual tension totally missed.

I often think about how in prior generations, there was next to nothing to do in the bedroom besides be present in the room together. You could read, sure. But that doesn't really compare to what we have in our hands now. And prior to the last couple of decades, access to nudity was much, much harder. People arrived in the bedroom together, nothing else to do, and there is your lover, and it was your first opportunity of the day to see a human naked. No distractions. Just you and your partner together. 

Then you wake up together, and there're are no messages to check, nothing to scroll... but your lover's body is right there. And there's virtually nothing that will give you has much of a chemical high of dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin waiting for you in the rest of your day. Touching them is the most neurologically interesting opportunity you'll have all day.

Granted, caring about women's pleasure is a relatively new invention in mainstream Western culture, so I'm really grateful to be in the point on the timeline of history I am in. 

I can't help but wonder, what would the state of sex in long term relationships be right now if we had a sexually progressive world AND no endless-novelty-machines?

One of the biggest things we did in our relationship to move toward DB recovery (besides the biggest thing - learning tantric sex - highly recommend), was making really strict phone agreements. Phone chargers got moved to the dresser across the room so we had to set them aside before getting into bed. Phones don't come to the dining table. Phones don't get used when we are speaking to each other. If we are having a conversation and something comes up and we want to use a phone to get information relevant to the discussion, or make a note, we ask the other person if that's acceptable or if they'd rather we do it later to keep the connection with each other stronger in the moment. 

We really started to see the phones as enemies of the relationship and treat them as such. Like it is us together as a team against the algorithms that seek to control us. Rebelliously resisting the machine and insisting on human connection above all else.

Right away we noticed a HUGE difference in how connected we felt to each other. And more make-out sessions, flirting, touching each other's bodies, and sex in random parts of the house ensued. 

Curious what other's experiences are in regard to device use and DB.",3,1766858958.0,DeadBedrooms,1,1.0,False

1px4b54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1px4b54/concerned_about_my_mom_could_this_be_spiritual/,Concerned about my mom - could this be spiritual psychosis?,"I’m not asking for a diagnosis, I’m mainly looking for advice, thoughts, or similar experiences.

My mom has a long history of trauma and abusive relationships with men. Most recently, we moved again after she broke up with another abuser. After this move, she initially seemed stable and was attending school.

Before everything escalated, she was working in massage therapy. During that time, she had an interaction with another employee where she asked him what was wrong. He said nothing was wrong, but she insisted she could sense that something was. When he asked how she knew, this seemed to reinforce her belief that she could intuitively read people. After this, she became increasingly convinced she had the ability to sense energy and read others.

Shortly after, she quit her job and went through a period where she was unemployed for several months. During this time, she did not really provide for us and became extremely focused on spirituality. This period almost felt like an “episode,” where she withdrew from normal responsibilities and daily life. Her beliefs escalated quickly and appeared very suddenly. She had never been spiritual before. She began describing what she called a spiritual awakening and became consumed by it. At the beginning, she would rant daily for very long periods to me and my siblings, repeating the same ideas and stories over and over again and telling us that we needed to “wake up.”  She was on the phone ranting to everyone else as well, for hours and hours on end everyday.

At first, she believed there were demons or evil spirits in our house. She said she could see them, allow them in, or keep them out. She hung crystals on the walls for protection and claimed the spirits were responsible for things like a leak in the ceiling. Later, she stopped talking about demons and said they were actually manifestations of her past trauma, but her beliefs continued to change rather than resolve. She also mentioned that she met her ancestors through all of this.

Around this same time, she met a black man and believed she had lived a past life as a Black girl because of a dream she had, and that this explained why she was connected to him. That relationship did not work out, but afterward she continued to believe in twin flames, reincarnation, and spiritual soul connections. The person she believes she is spiritually linked to has changed multiple times.

She believes there is a spiritual mirror between her and her twin flame, whoever he may be, and that she can feel his emotions, such as fear. She believes her current life circumstances are the result of her past lives.

She believes she has spiritual gifts, including sensing energy, reading people, and interpreting signs. She believes nothing is a coincidence. She always say that things are shown to her. She assigns meaning to nearly everything, birds she sees outside, repeating numbers, license plates, songs on the radio, vivid dreams , ringing in her ears (which she experienced especially in the beginning), animals’ behavior (including believing our dog growling was caused by her energy), people wearing similar clothes (for example, seeing multiple people wearing plaid and believing it was a sign), conversations she has with people, etc.

She believed that a license plate number confirmed she was going to marry Dermot Kennedy, and she made my brother text her a witness statement about it. She and a friend also believed that their coffee was moving on its own, which reinforced her belief in spiritual forces.

She believes songs contain direct messages meant specifically for her, and that her dreams are prophetic signs. She constantly googles or uses ChatGPT to find the spiritual meaning of everything, and fully believes whatever interpretation she finds. I feel that using ChatGPT has made this worse, because she can look up the spiritual meaning of literally anything and then treats it as confirmation.

She believes society itself is changing for spiritual reasons. When a virus was going around she said people are getting sicker because they are not spiritually awake. She believes the growth of the LGBTQ+ community has spiritual meaning and is part of something larger happening in the world. Basically anything going on the world currently, is linked to everything she believes in.

She often says things like “You guys will see what’s coming"", ""Soon you’ll know I’m not crazy"", ""Soon you’ll see that I’m right.”

Her sense of purpose or “path” keeps changing. At different times, she believed she was meant to pursue massage therapy, then it was to run a podcast, then do humanitarian work, then it was to give a TED Talk, now it's to write a book.

None of these have actually been completed. She was once on a podcast about her journey as well, but later rejected it and changed her beliefs again.

Over time, the constant ranting slowed as the awakening felt less “new,” but spirituality is still the only thing she talks about. She is not emotionally present anymore. She forgot my birthday and my sister’s birthday. I can’t go to her for advice or have a normal conversation because everything somehow circles back to her beliefs, and it doesn't feel like she's ever 100% listening when I talk about things.

She stopped celebrating holidays, including Christmas. Last year, she said we didn’t need a big Christmas because something major was going to happen and we would be “blessed” with a big vacation. That never happened. Towards the end of this year she is actually struggling pretty badly with money.

She announced publicly on Facebook that she no longer believes in Christmas and refused to attend family Christmas gatherings.

Overall, this came out of nowhere and completely took over her life. Her beliefs continue to shift, but the fixation remains. She no longer feels present. I’m struggling to understand whether this is truly a spiritual awakening or some form of psychosis. ",0,1766858843.0,Advice,0,0.5,False

1px4afj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1px4afj/what_just_happened_is_this_splitting_black_and/,What just happened? Is this splitting? Black and white thinking?,"F (45) M (47) dating 14 months.

My boyfriend just left me because of something extremely minor and I am leveled. I want to preface by saying I am in no way perfect and my boyfriend can be the absolute best. I love him dearly but I have suspected something like BPD for awhile because he puts me on a pedestal then will withdraw the pedastal slightly but its getting where he pulls the pedastal away quite drastically. He is now telling me I disregulate his nervous system and am a toxic partner and the main character just like my mother and brought up things I told him in confidence sort of using them against me. Just recently he said I felt like home to him and extolled me. It seems the bloom is off the rose and I am disappointing him more and more but at the same time, he gets angry over minor things, is touchy and terse and makes a cycle of dysfunction where I don’t know what to say but I never do the right thing either way. He seems to project and say I make him walk on eggshells when I try and be pleasant and agreeable and he is not picking me more and more. I know at times I am in the wrong, some times right, most times that we fight it’s just neutral stuff. Not worth the blow ups. But the blow ups are always a level 10. 

So these incidents regardless are earth shaking and always over rather minor things that he blows up over that result in these rants that almost seem like sabotage, especially when weeks prior the sun rose and set on me. No cheating or lying from either party. I have tried to help him with things and situations and think I’ve been very patient and forgiving. So all the upsets over petty things where I become the devil leave me rattled and doubting my self. 

My thinking is relationship have ups and downs and most things you can look over, but he gets upset over semi minor issues that I don’t mean to be offensive regarding so there are always monster fights no breaks. He will then start saying he is the bad guy, always wrong etc etc. makes things very black and white rather than calming down and seeing we just have a different view. 

He is often terse with me, which puts me on edge. doesn’t see me as a whole, I just become whatever pissed him off in passing and that’s enough to tear the house down. I will remind him after he gets pissed off, like with what happened this morning, how I rubbed his neck, brought him coffee as a way to put me into perspective and remind him I wasn’t trying to be a bitch when I don’t read his mind, then he will even bring that up to me saying, “you think you are good because you brought me coffee”. In my mind I am as good for bringing him coffee and rubbing his neck as I am bad for not understanding what he exactly wanted me to do in a moment like what happened earlier. I cannot console him. 

Even a few days ago he was talking about how happy and beautiful I looked and how I really meshed with his family and how he fell in love with me all over again then today he blows up because I didn’t know of a coffee house in the area for us to meet his friend at, friend visiting from out of town and wants to meet in an area with a decent theater so he can catch a movie later, but boyfriend got angry because I didn’t know of a coffee shop nearby the theater and I suggested he Google the area. What happens between me saying Google the area and him walking out is a haze. He kept saying I thought we could look at it together and I replied I thought he would look at the options since he knows his friends taste better and I would assist from there. No problem. He absolutely blew up though. And granted after him yelling at me I told him to leave and to meet his friend and let’s get space but he kept on and on and said if he leaves it will be for good. Very all or nothing. He woudk ask me over and over if I wanted him to leave for good. I said if he is going to be abusive maybe we should think about it. Maybe I should not have said that but I am reaching a breaking point and boundaries seem to make him even angrier. So it ended up I just sat and listened because any attempt I make to defend myself doesn’t go well. I went to another room and got out of his way. He would come in the room and argue with me and continue to say how bad a person I am. How cold and robotic. A bitch. He cried and would continue to argue from the other room but I was reeling because he said pretty bad things and I wanted to not make it worse. Idk. I just am in shock and numb. It all seemed like such an overkill and he has been touchy and irritable for weeks though. 

Over all I was demonized and he said some egregious things-I thought I was perfect, I call the shots etc, am a liar, things that in no way a person would want to continue in a relationship with having such a low opinion of their partner. I would ask him why on earth is he with me if he thinks these things then he would say he loved me and stayed because he loved me. It was all so baffling. I felt diminished, sad, speechless, cast aside, weird. Really floored. And I was damned if I talked, damned if I didn’t. 

Please any insight on what to do or what may be happening in a situation like this? I feel horrible. ",1,1766858795.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

Can anyone recommend any of the following:

* A reliable shipper to send a few choice pieces of furniture across the country (not fine art or anything but at least one or two fine furniture pieces
* A place to donate or consign pieces he doesn't want to bring with him.  Think large armoires, a nice pull-out couch, things like that, and many smaller knick-knacks.  Would want someone to come collect them ideally.
* He also has plates, silverware, coffee maker, things like that that we could just donate, but similarly would be great if someone could collect them
* Clothes and shoes and suitcases and stuff like that as well
* There will be tons of stuff to just throw away
* Are there people that organize and help with stuff like this?  Where I live (Los Angeles), there are companies that come in and organize estate sales open to the public, but I don't think that would be an option in his building.

I Just Read a Script Based on My Childhood Best Friend [Pt 1 of 10],"*OP's note: Since Wendigoon recently did a two hour video on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, I thought I'd post this creepypasta of mine which was heavily inspired by Conrad's novella.*

\[Hello everyone.  

Thanks to all of you who took the time to read this post. Hopefully, the majority of you will stick around for the continuation of this series. 

To start things off, let me introduce myself. I’m a guy who works at a horror movie studio. My job here is simply to read unproduced screenplays. I read through the first ten pages of a script, and if I like what I read, I pass it on to the higher-ups... If I’m being perfectly honest, I’m really just a glorified assistant – and although my daily duties consist of bringing people coffee, taking and making calls and passing on messages, my only pleasure with this job is reading crappy horror movie scripts so my asshole of a boss doesn’t have to. 

I’m actually a screenwriter by trade, which is why I took this job. I figured taking a job like this was a good way to get my own scripts read and potentially produced... Sadly, I haven’t passed on a single script of mine without it being handed back with the comment, “The story needs work.” I guess my own horror movie scripts are just as crappy as the ones I’m paid to read. 

Well, coming into work one morning, feeling rather depressed by another rejection, I sat down at my desk, read through one terrible screenplay before moving onto another (with the majority of screenplays I read, I barely make it past the first five pages), but then I moved onto the next screenplay in the pile. From the offset, I knew this script had a bunch of flaws. The story was way too long and the writing way too descriptive. You see, the trick with screenwriting is to write your script in as few words as possible, so producers can read as much of the story before determining if it was prospective or not. However, the writing and premise of this script was intriguing enough that I wanted to keep reading... and so, I brought the script home with me. 

Although I knew this script would never be produced – or at least, by this studio, I continued reading with every page. I kept reading until the protagonist was finally introduced, ten pages in... And to my absolute surprise, the name I read, in big, bold capital letters... was a name I recognized. The name I recognized read: HENRY CARTWRIGHT. Early 20’s. Caucasian. Brown hair. Blue eyes... You see, the reason I recognized this name, along with the following character description... was because it belonged to my former childhood best friend... 

This obviously had to be some coincidence, right? But not only did this fictional character have my old friend’s name and physical description, but like my friend (and myself) he was also an Englishman from north London. The writer’s name on the script’s front page was not Henry (for legal reasons, I can’t share the writer’s name) but it was plainly obvious to me that the guy who wrote this script, had based his protagonist off my best friend from childhood.  

Calling myself intrigued, I then did some research on Henry online – just to see what he was up to these days, and if he had any personal relation to the writer of this script. What I found, however, written in multiple headlines of main-stream news websites, underneath recent photos of Henry’s now grown-up face... was an incredible and terrifying story. The story I read in the news... was the very same story I was now reading through the pages of this script. Holy shit, I thought! Not only had something truly horrific happened to my friend Henry, but someone had then made a horror movie script out of it...  

So... when I said this script was the exact same story as the one in the news... that wasn’t entirely true. In order to explain what I mean by this, let me first summarize Henry’s story... 

According to the different news websites, Henry had accompanied a group of American activists on an expedition into the Congo Rainforest. Apparently, these activists wanted to establish their own commune deep inside the jungle (FYI, their reason for this, as well as their choice of location is pretty ludicrous – don't worry, you’ll soon see), but once they get into the jungle, they were then harassed by a group of local men who tried abducting them. Well, like a real-life horror movie, Henry and the Americans managed to escape – running as far away as they could through the jungle. But, once they escaped into the jungle, some of the Americans got lost, and they either starved to death, or died from some third-world disease... It’s a rather tragic story, but only Henry and two other activists managed to survive, before finding their way out of the jungle and back to civilization.  

Although the screenplay accurately depicts this tragic adventure story in the beginning... when the abduction sequence happens, that’s when the story starts to drastically differ - or at least, that’s when the screenplay starts to differ from the news' version of events... 

You see, after I found Henry’s story in the news, I then did some more online searching... and what I found, was that Henry had shared his own version of the story... In Henry’s own eye-witness account, everything that happens after the attempted abduction, differs rather unbelievably to what the news had claimed... And if what Henry himself tells after this point is true... then Holy Mother of fucking hell! 

This now brings me onto the next thing... Although the screenplay’s first half matches with the news’ version of the story... the second half of the script matches only, and perfectly with the story, as told by Henry himself.  

I had no idea which version was true – the news (because they’re always reliable, right?) or Henry’s supposed eyewitness account. Well, for some reason, I wanted to get to the bottom of this – perhaps due to my past relation to Henry... and so, I got in contact with the screenwriter, whose phone number and address were on the front page of the script. Once I got in contact with the writer, where we then met over a cup of coffee, although he did admit he used the news' story and Henry’s own account as resources... the majority of what he wrote came directly from Henry himself. 

Like me, the screenwriter was greatly intrigued by Henry’s story. Well, once he finally managed to track Henry down, not only did Henry tell this screenwriter what really happened to him in the jungle, but he also gave permission for the writer to adapt his story into a feature screenplay. 

Apparently, when Henry and the two other survivors escaped from the jungle, because of how unbelievable their story would sound, they decided to tell the world a different and more plausible ending. It was only a couple of years later, and plagued by terrible guilt, did Henry try and tell the world the horrible truth... Even though Henry’s own version of what happened is out there, he knew if his story was adapted into a movie picture, potentially watched by millions, then more people would know to stay as far away from the Congo Rainforest as humanly possible. 

Well, now we know Henry’s motive for sharing this story with the world - and now, here is mine... In these series of posts, I’m going to share with you this very same screenplay (with the writer’s and Henry’s blessing, of course) to warn as many of you as possible about the supposed evil that lurks deep inside the Congo Rainforest... If you’re now thinking, “Why shouldn’t I just wait for the movie to come out?” Well, I’ve got some bad news for you. Not only does this screenplay need work... but the horrific events in this script could NEVER EVER be portrayed in any feature film... horror or otherwise.  

Well, I think we’re just about ready to dive into this thing. But before we get started here, let me lay down how this is going to go. Through the reading of this script, I’ll eventually jump in to clarify some things, like context, what is faithful to the true story or what was changed for film purposes. I should also mention I will be omitting some of the early scenes. Don’t worry, not any of the good stuff – just one or two build-up scenes that have some overly cringe dialogue. Another thing I should mention, is the original script had some fairly offensive language thrown around - but in case you’re someone who’s easily offended, not to worry, I have removed any and all offensive words - well, most of them.  

If you also happen to be someone who has never read a screenplay before, don’t worry either, it’s pretty simple stuff. Just think of it as reading a rather straight-forward novel. But, if you do come across something in the script you don’t understand, let me know in the comments and I’ll happily clarify it for you. 

To finish things off here, let me now set the tone for what you can expect from this story... This screenplay can be summarized as *Apocalypse Now* meets Jordon Peele’s *Get Out*, meets Danny Boyle’s *The Beach* meets Eli Roth’s *The Green Inferno*, meets Wes Craven’s *The Serpent and the Rainbow*... 

Well, I think that’s enough stalling from me... Let’s begin with the show\]  

LOGLINE: A young Londoner accompanies his girlfriend’s activist group on a journey into the heart of African jungle, only to discover they now must resist the very evil humanity vowed to leave behind.    

**EXT. BLACK VOID - BEGINNING OF TIME**   

...We stare into a DARK NOTHINGNESS. A BLACK EMPTY CANVAS on the SCREEN... We can almost hear a WAILING - somewhere in its VAST SPACE. GHOSTLY HOWLS, barely even heard... We stay in this EMPTINESS for TEN SECONDS...   

FADE IN:   

""Going up that river was like travelling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings"" - Heart of Darkness   

FADE TO:  

**EXT. JUNGLE - CENTRAL AFRICA - NEOLITHIC AGE - DAY**   

The ominous WORDS fade away - transitioning us from an endless dark void into a seemingly endless GREEN PRIMAL ENVIROMENT.   

VEGETATION rules everywhere. From VINES and SNAKE-LIKE BRANCHES of the immense TREES to THIN, SPIKE-ENDED LEAVES covering every inch of GROUND and space.   

The INTERIOR to this jungle is DIM. Light struggles to seep through holes in the tree-tops - whose prehistoric TRUNKS have swelled to an IMMENSE SIZE. We can practically feel the jungle breathing life. Hear it too: ANIMAL LIFE. BIRDS chanting and MONKEYS howling off screen.   

ON the FLOOR SURFACE, INSECT LIFE thrives among DEAD LEAVES, DEAD WOOD and DIRT... until:   

FOOTSTEPS. ONE PAIR of HUMAN FEET stride into frame and then out. And another pair - then out again. Followed by another - all walking in a singular line...   

These feet belong to THREE PREHISTORIC HUNTERS. Thin in stature and SMALL - VERY SMALL, in fact. Barely clothed aside from RAGS around their waists. Carrying a WOODEN SPEAR each. Their DARK SKIN gleams with sweat from the humid air.   

The middle hunter is DIFFERENT - somewhat feminine. Unlike the other two, he possesses TRIBAL MARKINGS all over his FACE and BODY, with SMALL BONE piercings through the ears and lower-lip. He looks almost to be a kind of shaman. A Seer... A WOOT.  

The hunters walk among the trees. Brief communication is heard in their ANCIENT LANGUAGE (NO SUBTITLES) - until the middle hunter (the Woot) sees something ahead. Holds the two back.  

We see nothing.   

The back hunter (KEMBA) then gets his throwing arm ready. Taking two steps forward, he then lobs his spear nearly 20 yards ahead. Landing - SHAFT protrudes from the ground.   

They run over to it. Kemba plucks out his spear – lifts the HEAD to reveal... a DARK GREEN LIZARD, swaying its legs in its dying moments. The hunters study it - then laugh hysterically... except the Woot.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - EVENING**    

The hunters continue to roam the forest - at a faster pace. The shades of green around them dusk ever darker.   

LATER:   

They now squeeze their way through the interior of a THICK BUSH. The second hunter (BANUK) scratches himself and wails. The Woot looks around this mouth-like structure, concerned - as if they're to be swallowed whole at any moment.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOS**   

They ascend out the other side. Brush off any leaves or scrapes - and move on.  

The two hunters look back to see the Woot has stopped.   

KEMBA (SUBTITLES): (to Woot) What is wrong?   

The Woot looks around, again concernedly at the scenery. Noticeably different: a DARKER, SINISTER GREEN. The trees feel more claustrophobic. There's no sound... animal and insect life has died away.   

WOOT (SUBTITLES): ...We should go back... It is getting dark.   

Both hunters agree, turn back. As does the Woot: we see the whites of his eyes widen - searching around desperately...   

CUT TO:   

The Woot's POV: the supposed bush, from which they came – has vanished! Instead: a dark CONTINUATION of the jungle.   

The two hunters notice this too.   

KEMBA: (worrisomely) Where is the bush?!   

Banuk points his spear to where the bush should be.   

BANUK: It was there! We went through and now it has gone!   

As Kemba and Banuk argue, words away from becoming violent, the Woot, in front of them: is stone solid. Knows – feels something's deeply wrong.   

**EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - DAYS LATER**   

The hunters continue to trek through the same jungle. Hunched over. Spears drag on the ground. Visibly fatigued from days of non-stop movement - unable to find a way back. Trees and scenery around all appear the same - as if they've been walking in circles. If anything, moving further away from the bush.   

Kemba and Banuk begin to stagger - cling to the trees and each other for support.   

The Woot, clearly struggles the most, begins to lose his bearings - before suddenly, he crashes down on his front - facedown into dirt.   

The Woot slowly rises – unaware that inches ahead he's reached some sort of CLEARING. Kemba and Banuk, now caught up, stop where this clearing begins. On the ground, the Woot sees them look ahead at something. He now faces forward to see:   

The clearing is an almost perfect CIRCLE. Vegetation around the edges - still in the jungle... And in the centre -planted upright, lies a LONG STUMP of a solitary DEAD TREE.  

DARKER in colour. A DIFFERENT kind of WOOD. It's also weathered - like the remains of a forest fire.   

A STONE-MARKED PATHWAY has also been dug, leading to it. However, what's strikingly different is the tree - almost three times longer than the hunters, has a FACE - carved on the very top.  

THE FACE: DARK, with a distinctive HUMAN NOSE. BULGES for EYES. HORIZONTAL SLIT for a MOUTH. It sits like a severed, impaled head.   

The hunters peer up at the face's haunting, stone-like expression. Horrified... Except the Woot - appears to have come to a spiritual awakening of some kind.   

The Woot begins to drag his tired feet towards the dead tree, with little caution or concern - bewitched by the face. Kemba tries to stop him, but is aggressively shrugged off.   

On the pathway, the Woot continues to the tree - his eyes have not left the face. The tall stump arches down on him. The SUN behind it - gives the impression this is some kind of GOD. RAYS OF LIGHT move around it - creates a SHADE that engulfs the Woot. The God swallowing him WHOLE.   

Now closer, the Woot anticipates touching what seems to be: a RED HUMAN HAND-SHAPED PRINT branded on the BARK... Fingers inches away - before:  

A HIGH-PITCHED GROWL races out from the jungle! Right at the Woot! Crashes down - ATTACKING HIM! CANINES sink into flesh!   

The Woot cries out in horrific pain. The hunters react. They spear the WILD BEAST on top of him. Stab repetitively – stain what we see only as blurred ORANGE/BROWN FUR, red! The beast cries out - yet still eager to take the Woot's life. The stabbing continues - until the beast can't take anymore. Falls to one side, finally off the Woot. The hunters go round to continue the killing. Continue stabbing. Grunt as they do it - blood sprays on them... until finally realizing the beast has fallen silent. Still with death.   

The beast's FACE. Dead BROWN EYES stare into nothing... as Kemba and Banuk stare down to see:   

This beast is now a PRIMATE.  

Something about it is familiar: its SKIN. Its SHAPE. HANDS and FEET - and especially its face... It's almost... HUMAN.   

Kemba and Banuk are stunned. Clueless to if this thing is ape or man? Man or animal? Forget the Woot is mortally wounded. His moans regain their attention. They kneel down to him - see as the BLOOD oozes around his eyes and mouth – and the GAPING BITE MARK shredded into his shoulder. The Woot turns up to the CIRCULAR SKY. Mumbles unfamiliar words... Seems to cling onto life... one breath at a time.   

CUT TO:   

A CHAMELEON - in the trees. Camouflaged as dark as the jungle. Watches over this from a HIGH BRANCH.   

**EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - NIGHT**    

Kemba and Banuk sit around a PRIMITIVE FIRE, stare motionless into the FLAMES. Mentally defeated - in a captivity they can't escape.   

THUNDER is now heard, high in the distance - yet deep and foreboding.   

The Woot. Laid out on the clearing floor - mummified in big leaves for warmth. Unconscious. Sucks air in like a dying mammal...   

THEN:  

The Woot erupts into wakening! Coincides with the drumming thunder! EYES WIDE OPEN. Breathes now at a faster and more panicked pace. The hunters startle to their knees as the thunder produces a momentary WHITE FLASH of LIGHTNING. The Woot's mouth begins to make words. Mumbled at first - but then:  

WOOT: HORROR!... THE HORROR!... THE HORROR!  

Thunder and lightning continue to drum closer. The hunters panic - yell at each other and the Woot.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...   

Kemba screams at the Woot to stop, shakes him - as if forgotten he's already awake.  

WOOT (CONT'D): HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Banuk tries to pull Kemba back. Lightning exposes their actions.   

BANUK: Leave him!   

KEMBA: Evil has taken him!!   

WOOT: HORROR! HORROR! HORROR!...  

Kemba now races to his spear, before stands back over the Woot on the ground. Lifts the spear - ready to skewer the Woot into silence, when:   

THUNDER CLAMOURS AS A WHITE LIGHT FLASHES THE WHOLE CLEARING - EXPOSES KEMBA, SPEAR OVER HEAD.   

KEMBA: (stiffens)...   

The flash vanishes.   

Kemba looks down... to see the end of another spear protrudes from his chest. His spear falls through his fingers. Now clutches the one inside him - as the Woot continues...   

WOOT: Horror! Horror!...   

Kemba falls to one side as a white light flashes again - reveals Banuk behind him: wide-eyed in disbelief. The Woot's rantings have slowed down considerably.   

WOOT (CONT'D): Horror... horror... (faint)... horror...   

Paying no attention to this, Banuk goes to his murdered huntsmen, laid to one side - eyes peer into the darkness ahead...  

Banuk. Still knelt down besides Kemba. Unable to come to terms with what he's done. Starts to rise back to his feet - when:   

THUNDER! LIGHTING! THUD!!   

Banuk takes a blow to the HEAD! Falls down instantly to reveal:   

The Woot! On his feet! White light exposes his DELIRIOUS EXPRESSION - and one of the pathway stones gripped between his hands!   

Down, but still alive, Banuk drags his half-motionless body towards the fire, which reflects in the trailing river of blood behind him. A momentary white light. Banuk stops to turn over. Takes fast and jagged breaths - as another momentary light exposes the Woot moving closer. Banuk meets the derangement in the Woot's eyes. Sees his hands raise the rock up high... before a final blow is delivered:   

WOOT (CONT'D): AHH!   

THUD! Stone meets SKULL. The SOLES of Banuk's jerking feet become still...   

Thunder's now dormant.   

The Woot: truly possessed. Gets up slowly. Neanderthals his way past the lifeless bodies of Kemba and Banuk. He now sinks down between the ROOTS of the tree with the face. Blood and sweat glazed all over, distinguish his tribal markings. From the side, the fire and momentary lightning expose his NEOLITHIC features.   

The Woot caresses the tree's roots on either side of him... before... 

WOOT (CONT'D): (silent) ...The horror...   

FADE OUT.   

TITLE: **ASILI**   

\[So, that was the cold open to *ASILI*, the screenplay you just read. If you happen to wonder why this opening takes place in prehistoric times, well here is why... What you just read was actually a dream sequence of Henry’s. You see, once Henry was in the jungle, he claimed to have these very lucid dreams of the jungle’s terrifying history – even as far back as prehistory... I know, pretty strange stuff. 

Make sure to tune in next week for the continuation of the story, where we’ll be introduced to our main characters before they answer the call to adventure. 

Thanks for reading everyone, and feel free to leave your thoughts and theories in the comments.

What is in the $200-300 range that would be worthwhile for someone to learn on and accommodate those parameters?

So.. I have a coworker-friend called Georgia who is 12 years older than me (im 27) We have worked together for about three years in different departments, and everyone at work knows we are really close. 

We take our breaks together, constantly find each other during shifts, and have loads of inside jokes. Colleagues joke that we are inseparable or tell us to “stop flirting,” which we always laugh off.
Georgia is Eastern European and very reserved and private shes also extremely shy and quite anxious.

She does not open up easily to people. We joke all the time that we “cannot be nice to each other” at work because that would look suspicious, so instead we tease, blame, and bully each other playfully. We say being mean “looks better,” and we constantly joke, “we are just colleagues, remember.”
A lot of our interaction is silly back-and-forth banter. We literally order each other around as a joke. She will say things like “Get me a coffee, thanks,” and I will respond with “Why should I, huh?” Or she will tell me to make her a coffee and I will say, “Say please and I might consider it,” and she will bat her eyelashes and go, “Pleeeease, Luuuuuuce?” It is all very unserious and mutual, but very visible to other people.

She often asks when I am working next and checks my schedule, and when we are in together we naturally gravitate toward each other without really trying.

She has two young kids. I am not a very kid-oriented person and she knows that, but I genuinely like her kids and they seem to really like me too. Over the last couple of years I have spent a lot of time with her and the kids doing things like bowling, going to cafés, Halloween trick-or-treating, and Christmas markets two years in a row. A lot of these were first-time experiences for them.

 The kids know me by name, ask about me, get excited when my name is mentioned, and sometimes assume I am coming over. She has told me they miss me, and this year they even made me a Christmas card with a heart.

English is not her first language, and joking about it is a big part of our dynamic. I tease her when she gets words wrong, she laughs and pretends to be offended, and she calls me her “English teacher.” She also jokes that I am a bad influence because I teach her swear words. 

This year she also wrote me a Christmas card that said “Thanks for the English lessons this year” and gave me my favourite chocolate bar, something I had only mentioned off-hand a few weeks earlier.


She tells me a lot about her personal life and her relationship, which she is unhappy in. When something stressful happens, I am usually the first person she reaches out to. Once she messaged me at 5am and later said she never messages anyone at that time except her “bestie.”

At work there is also a lot of playful physical stuff like joking hits, arm slaps, hair pulling, blaming me for everything, and holding eye contact longer than necessary. Other colleagues notice it and joke about us, and we joke that people are going to “talk about us.”
Recently, we finally hung out just the two of us without the kids, which she was a bit shy about at first but agreed to after a lot of joking back and forth.

At the Christmas market this year, she took her son to meet Santa for the first time ever. I waited outside while they went in. Afterward, she said that she wanted me to come in with them. I didn't know how to react so I just laughed and said maybe the dad should do it and she rolled her eyes. 

What confuses me is the overall intensity of it all, especially involving the kids. I did not expect to become such a familiar person in her children’s lives, and sometimes I wonder why their dad does not do these things with them, which she usually brushes off. Idk what to do.

I’ve already read a few high fantasies:   
\- *The Hobbit*  
\- *The Fellowship* *of the Ring*  
\- *Eragon*  
\- First three books of '*A Song of Ice and Fire'*   
\- And first three of *Witcher* series  
They’re my absolute favorites. I love them with my whole heart.

The thing is, I’m super intimidated by epic fantasy books when I try to read it on my own. It sounds stupid, and honestly don’t know why I can’t just pick up a book and read it.

Some of the books on my TBR that I’m especially excited about are: *The Earthsea Cycle* by Ursula Le Guin, *The Dragonbone Chair* by Tad Williams, *The Eye of the World* by Robert Jordan, ANYTHING by Brandon Sanderson - I really want to read something by him, *The Two Towers* and *The Return of the King* by Tolkien, *The Shadow of the Gods* by John Gwynne, and so so many more.

These are the perfect months to cozy up with a hefty fantasy book under a warm blanket with a cup of coffee or tea. It would be amazing to do that with someone else so we can tackle these bad boys together, immerse ourselves in new worlds, and talk about them as we go.

P.S. I’m absolutely open to reading fantasy books that aren’t on my TBR. Those are just the ones I’m most hyped about right now, lol, but anything works.

So yeah, if you’re also intimidated by discovering brand-new epic worlds alone, or if you want an excuse to reread your favorites, let me know. I think it would be super fun.

This might be a little niche, but I’m hoping to find my people 😊

My partner is very patient but… not that interested 😅

I’m thinking about starting a book club / discussion group where we meet once a month (coffee, wine, cozy vibes) to talk about things like:
	•	The Telepathy Tapes
	•	Books like Life After Life
	•	Consciousness, intuition, psi stuff
	•	Skeptic-friendly curiosity, not dogma
	•	Open conversation without needing

Hi, I'm a student and currently in 3rd year of undergrad. So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes',. Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !

Most of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question.

So, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.

1px3upf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1px3upf/should_i_listen_more_to_my_thoughts_and_emotions/,Should I listen more to my thoughts and emotions from morning or night?,"Hi,

Broke it up into sections so you can read what’s relevant to you and skip what you don’t have time for because I’m fully aware I’m a yapper. Just giving as much context as possible if desired.

Problem:

I’ve noticed recently what I feel and think at night is very different from what I feel and think in the morning, and it’s on a very consistent time cycle without any conflict “resolution” or “progress” or “problem solving” It’s just this ongoing Jekyll and Hyde, morning and night, thing. And it’s a very sharp, notable contrast.

In the morning I feel this angsty(?), bitter, slighted, rage emotion, and impatience for things to pass, and I want to take action and rip up everything in my life and start over fresh. 

By night I’m more mellow and zen, and patient and calm (albeit it’s at the “cost” of being a bit mind numbed and brain dead), and I just want to ride life out, and let it all happen, and let it pass without doing anything drastic. “It’s not that big a deal.”

Question:

I’m curious if one of these mental and emotional states is more “me” than the other version? I’m making very big decisions in life right now and it’s been hard to know which version of me is the authentic one to listen to more.

My psych context:

34M, 

180lbs, 

diagnosed recently (I feel correctly) with cyclothymia 

100mg of lamotrigine (since August-ish)

It has been amazing for me. Even my coworkers complimented my new doc and these meds.

Veteran (idk if that matters but I am much more prone to anger than I was as a kid, coupled with forgetfulness and memory less right after service my psych keeps flirting with ptsd but hasn’t diagnosed that)

Perhaps it’s what time of day I’m taking meds? When I wake up. Which is what I’m thinking. I was on Wellbutrin and Zoloft for a while prior before weening off and I was just permanently angry, aggressive, more depressed, and completely mentally fogged and blocked and zombied every minute of the day (but not very actionable). But on lamotrigine I’ve felt like I have a better emotional regulation and less brain fog and social capacity and very flexible and mellow.

This morning rage is a very recent development. It started this month, between doc appointments (last was late Nov, next is early Jan)

I’ve been going to the doctor since getting out of the military for what feels like a mild-ADHD/concentration/forgetfulness/mild-anxiety/mild-depression combination. I do say mild because to me it’s all borderline. The most severe are inability to focus on what’s in front of me, forgetfulness, and depression.

Specific examples:

It’s with a lot of things, but two examples currently would be with my absentee closest friend’s behavior, and my decision on moving across the US for a higher paying job offer.

Example 1:

With my friend, I know they’ve been super depressed and have very intense ADHD, but for the past 16 months they’ve gone into such a deep hole they’re almost nonexistent at this point. Rarely replying to messages, unwilling to going out and socialize even for something simple like coffee to catch up, sharing their life in general (like on social). It’s been absolutely killing me. It feels like my biggest support ghosted and abandoned me. 

At night, I have patience, love, understanding, and forgiveness and want them to heal even though it’s silently destroying me, and I just grin and bear it until they find their way out of their dark hole.

But in the mornings, I wake up and just want to torch everything with them. I absolutely hate them, I resent them, I want to end our 20 year friendship, delete them from my memory and walk away forever. I’m so fucking angry. It’s like when Anakin choked out Padme. So much love and passion turned pissed and frustrated. Snap the fuck out of it. It’s obviously killing me and maybe I should walk away and choose me.

Example 2:

With work, I’m in a job that is more or less ideal in the long run and I’m generally happy and would retire there, and it’s very easy and stress free and peaceful great work life balance. But they are huge on having paper credentials that generally don’t matter in the industry and they’re forcing me to get them and go way above and beyond than what any other employer would require credential-wise while paying way less than industry standard for my experience level. I got upset one day and rage-applied and I’ve been (accidentally? lol) moving forward in the job interview process for the equivalent job at a significantly higher “experience level” for much higher pay that only requires my current experience, and not obnoxious additional paper creds for less pay (but a better life/stress balance). But it’s a move across the country.

In the morning I stress out about moving, the whole interview process, “what if I’m leaving a cushy job and moving to a worse situation”, then “nah fuck my employer they’re knowingly taking advantage of me rn I deserve better,” “all this just to be a boy in their club?”, stress over leaving everything but also feeling like maybe I need the change, it feels like it’s like I’m uprooting my whole existence, etc.

But by night I’m much more mellow about my situation and I’m like “just stay the course, ride out another few years of the credential accumulation , you’ll be better for it, and you can coast into old age without all this current stress.",1,1766857742.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

Several years ago na ito. I was with my friends, and ako lang yung guy sa group that time. Since ako lang lalaki, I offered to drive, pero car ng friend ko yung gamit namin.

We went to Tagaytay, doon sa downhill Starbucks. Inabot kami ng closing, and medyo late na rin, around 12mn na ata yon. Ayaw na namin bumiyahe pauwi kasi foggy and delikado sa daan, so we decided na mag-stay muna sa parking lot hanggang sunrise.

Naka-park lang kami, tahimik lang. Bukas yung front doors para pumasok yung malamig na hangin. Lahat busy sa kanya-kanyang ginagawa. I was in the driver’s seat scrolling sa phone. Yung isa kong friend may ginagawa sa laptop. Yung dalawa nasa backseat, nag-uusap.

Habang nakatungo ako sa phone, parang may naaaninag akong something white na papalapit sa windshield. At first, I thought ilaw lang or reflection. Pero habang papalapit, mas nagiging malinaw… parang may shape na siya.

Tapos bigla, sabay na nagsara yung dalawang front doors. Hindi yon basta-basta masasara ng hangin lang promise. 

Nagkatinginan kami nung friend ko sa passenger seat, yung tipong “Ikaw din ba…?” look. Tinanong ko siya, “May nakita ka rin ba?” Sabi niya, “Oo… may puti din akong naaninagan.”

Ayun na. Lahat kami biglang natahimik. Yung dalawa sa likod, biglang kumapit na rin sa gitna. Walang gustong tumingin sa windows. Ramdam mo yung bigat ng hangin sa loob ng kotse, parang may kasama kami na hindi namin nakikita.

Sinasabi nila, “Umalis na tayo, drive na, drive na.” Pero honestly, I couldn’t. Nanlalambot legs ko sa takot. Feeling ko kapag ginalaw ko pa yung sasakyan, may mangyayaring hindi maganda.

So sabi ko, “Wait lang… magdasal muna tayo.” Nagdasal kami sabay-sabay, eyes closed. 

After nun, unti-unti kaming kumalma. Parang gumaan yung feeling.

Doon lang ako naglakas ng loob mag-start ng engine. Umalis na kami and diretso na lang sa Mcdo sa Sta. Rosa para doon magpahinga.

Hanggang ngayon, di ko alam kung ano talaga yun. Pero lahat kami — may nakita. And weird part? Sabay na nagsara yung pinto kahit walang hangin, walang tao sa labas.

Parang may dumaan lang. Or may tumingin lang sa amin.

Ayun, hanggang ngayon naiisip ko pa rin kung ano kaya yon… at ayoko na talaga bumalik doon ng at magpaabot ng gabi. ",26,1766857630.0,phhorrorstories,1,1.0,False

I recently bought a bag of Savorworks Riverdale (roasted on 21st, brewed for the first time today, 27th). Here's the recipe I'm following (on the Hario Switch, hario filter paper that comes with the box)

  
Recipe (Coffee Chronicler's recipe for Hario Switch):

- 10gm of coffee beans (ground to 18 clicks on Timemore Chestnut C2S)
- 150gm of water at 90°C


1. pour 75gm of water in 45s with the switch open (pour over style bloom)
2. Close the switch
3. Pour the remaining 75gm of water in 45s
4. Open the switch and let it sit for 2:00

I tried this recipe once with 15gm/225gm with grind size 15 clicks but that tasted really bitter, with a factory-like taste on the open - diluting it helped, but not by a lot. Then I saw a post on this sub that suggested increasing the grind size - I did that but there was still a noticeable bitter opening note. The nougat and chocolate notes came through in the aftertaste, but not on the top notes at all. This has concerned me - have I got a bad batch of beans, or am I messing up the brew?

What recipe has worked for you folks with these Riverdale beans? Would love to know if anyone has a nice pour-over/switch recipe :)
Thanks!

1px3s13,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeEssays/comments/1px3s13/check_your_common_app_essay_for_these_red_flags/,"Check your Common App Essay for these Red Flags 🚩 🚩 -- before you ""Submit""","It's now down to the wire. And AOs are about to get hit with a tsunami of essays. Make sure yours doesn't get drowned without a trace.

Your personal statement can be many things, but there are a few minefields to avoid. I’m listing these so you can do a quick vibe check and make sure your essay isn’t quietly sabotaging your application. None of this is new — similar advice exists everywhere. There are thousands of YouTube videos, TikTok reels, and “essays that got me in” posts online — and yet every year, thousands of students submit personal statements that sink them.

Before you hit SUBMIT, make sure yours doesn’t fall into one of these.

\*\*The grandparent illness essay.\*\* Grandpa with Alzheimer’s, or Gandma with breast cancer.. It’s often beautifully written, and richly textured. The problem is there is likely 10,000 of them. Often the essay portrays a strong bond with your grandparent but beyond that really reveals almost nothing about you. This one is especially common for pre-meds… and if the essay ends at “this made me want to be a doctor,” it’s dead. You just lost your chance to make any impression on the AO.

\*\*The ESPN highlight -\*\* This is about that final winning shot or the team that faced setbacks and then ultimately won. In another variant it is about an almost win - but then realizing it's about the journey the person - or team - underwent. Grit, discipline, early mornings, teamwork.. I have seen this more so in boys and again betrays a lack of creativity and imagination. AOs have seen this arc so often it's quite likely they take 6 seconds to skim to the end. Ask yourself what this essay reveals about YOU that it couldn't reveal about any one of your 500 classmates in school?

\*\*The Manufactured Adversity -\*\* Social anxiety. Fear of heights. Fear of public speaking. A bad grade or semester (even worse!). There’s some kind of inspiration, a source of courage, a clean resolution, and a lesson learned. Many of you have been fortunate to have not had anything worse as the hardest thing in your life. Doesn't mean the pain is any less real or fake. But remember the AOs are reading about kids from far less privileged backgrounds all the time. Put yourself in their shoes and you can get a sense of how your essay could be perceived. Framing it as a life-defining struggle and neatly resolving it makes you sound unintentionally fragile or out of touch esp if it tends to have a melodramatic vibe.

\*\*A Major Tragedy\*\*

On the exact flip side : essays about major personal trauma. A sibling's death. Divorce. Or a friend who committed suicide. You trap the reader in a long stretch of grief. The mood of the entire essay is now heavy. Sombre. This is not the ideal mood you want to build for the few minutes the AO has your file. The point of the essay should not be sympathy. If at all possible dont turn your essay into a emotional catharsis/ self therapy session.

\*\*The Siddhartha Story.\*\*

You know the story. Protected life. First encounter with suffering. Moral awakening. Transformation. This is probably the single most abused genre, right there with sports. Every year we read thousands of these. You volunteer at a food bank. Or worse - spend 2 weeks laying bricks in Mexico. You realize how privileged you are. And then you start your nonprofit and raise money. The job still isnt done and you want to come to Harvard to learn how to do more. AOs are exhausted by this one. Not only is it painfully boring, it screams money, and unintentionally displays privilege and betrays a savior attitude.

\*\*The Resume brag - done ""humbly"".\*\*

Probably the worst way to waste the entire essay. Almost better to leave it blank. You spend the entire essay gift wrapping your resume but with touchpoints to make it sound like you are not really bragging. This

happened - so i did this - and that is how won this award or accolade - but it wasn't just me it was everyone else who helped bla bla.

Here’s what most applicants miss:

The best essays are almost never about big, dramatic life events.

The best essays are the ones you write a LOT about LITTLE.

They’re about everyday moments, examined deeply.

The mistake students make is rewinding their 16 years of school life hunting for a big story or headline that has the right elements for an essay. Instead the smart move is to take something ordinary in your life and figure out how to make a great essay out of it.

That difference is everything. And yet this seldom happens.

This doesnt need to consume 3 months of time. Just spend a few hours thinking of small everyday things in your life. Take for instance say a trip you just made to your barber to look good for Christmas. Sit with it. You will soon figure out there's a number of ways of turning that experience into an essay. Maybe talk about how your barber remembers subtle preferences without writing anything down. That simple observation isn’t interesting just because its different, or even because it’s charming; it’s interesting because it reveals to the AO how you think .. and you can take it in may directions - make it about experience, expertise, trust, or even why human judgment still matters in a world obsessed with automation and AI.. Spend a day or even a weekend and you can easily come up with 5 or 6 of them. You just need to know what you are looking for. The moment itself doesn’t matter. The noticing does.

Now imagine yourself as an AO reading a essay about visit to the barber and your quirky reflections on the visit – and one where you spent 2 weeks in Costa Rica and now are inspired to save the planet. Which one do to remember when you turn off your laptop for the day? Which kid are you rooting for in a committee?

Another way to sanity-check your essay: imagine you’re the AO and this isn’t an application at all. It’s a casual coffee chat at Starbucks. The essay is just the conversation your friend is having with you. Ask yourself honestly — in a scale of 1 to 10 how bored are you? Do you feel trapped & just listening politely? Or would you actually be interested enough to want another coffee and keep talking? If the essay feels stiff, rehearsed, or exhausting as a conversation, it’ll feel the same way on the page. If you read your essay and someone swapped the name on the file with that of any one of 20 of your classmates and it would still be valid, ditch that essay.

Remember - the purpose of the essay is not to ""impress"" the AO showing him what happened in your life, and how amazing and gifted you are - the resume activities section already speak a lot to that.

Here's how this works for the smooth brains.

There is only 39 sol in the liquidity pool. (4.7k usd)

If any single one of the top holders sell, you're fucked and holding a worthless coin.

You are literally 1 transaction away from zero.

Stop trying to pretend that you are anything more than a script kitty scammer. You are a drain on our community and on the world. We would be better off if you ate a shotgun shell.

If you dont understand crypto, you are 100% going to fail. Not an opinion, its a fact.

So hate me if you want, but one of us has thousands in the bank, and it more than likley isn't you if you support this trash.

As a wise man once said ""I just want to watch the world burn"" and every scammer can go back to their mud hut and slurp some cow dung for all I care, but if you're in a 1st world country, ignore these clowns.   
  
You would be better off just lighting your money on fire or using it as toilet paper.

Hi all,

I'm moving to Boston and would love some advice on finding an apartment complex that is located in an area which makes getting to mass General hospital and Brigham and women’s hospital easy, has a fitness center, allows a dog, and has an authentic Boston feel in a good neighborhood. From what I have gathered so far we are mostly hoping to find a place in north end, back bay, beacon hill, or south end. What complexes should we be looking at/schedule a tour of when we come visit before deciding?Thanks for your help. 

What I'm Looking For:

- 2 bedroom, 2 bath
- Budget: up to 5,500/month but would love to find closer to 4,000/month
- In unit washer dryer 
- Gym in complex
- Nice walkable area (coffee shops restaurants etc)
- Furnished would be a plus but not necessary

We’d like to move in May of this year.

1px3jlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1px3jlr/i_feel_like_a_bad_mom/,I feel like a bad mom,"I’m 35 and have a very much wanted 5 month old who is so adorable and sweet. he’s not an exceptionally difficult baby but not an easy baby either. he doesnt entertain himself well and wants constant stimulation. I’m home alone with him 4 days a week and I work long days the other three. we have no family close by. I’m so happy that I have my little family but in the thick of the days alone with my baby I sometimes feel like I’m drowning, especially now that he’s started fighting even contact naps sometimes. 

  
a good example would be today, I woke up with him at 6:30, gave him a bottle, changed him, and put him in his bouncy chair and was able to get some bottles cleaned. he took a 40 minute contact nap and then was up, had another bottle, my husband left for work. I was finally able to put him down for a nap, made a cup of coffee and got a granola bar ready to hopefully just sit in peace for 30-40 minutes, but he woke up less than 10 minutes later and my soul feel crushed.

  
i just feel like i have no time to recharge in life and am rubbing in fumes constantly. even when my husband is home i do 90% of the holding bouncing playing feeding and contact napping. I love my baby so much but sometimes i get frustrated and just feel so burnt out wanting to just sit in silence or stare at my phone.

I am trying to plug into something else to get to a normalcy in my life, stronger. Better.. but it ruminates in my head and physically ill from it.

I am struggling and I can’t keep this mask of happiness on.  and too burnt out to talk about it. I am tired  of trying….Sorry for the ramble but that is where I’m at.

is it not?

as i turn my back, i see

lee kwan yew chiding me. or perhaps 

reassuringly yet firmly coaxing me, reminding me 

of my erroneous luxury. this generation then

does not know how it feels to suffer.

i see many things. many things- 

the things that were once presented to me still are.

the people i used to meet still move.

how very strange the process of moving house, of moving out 

can be. i am reminded 

of naked men falling forwards and backwards into trance.

prisoners still yet to escape. free men still yet

to find the heaven they are seeking. straight-gay men 

telling each other stories to pass the time. i see

the odd, shapeless raindrops dancing on 

my lap, i see persephone and wish i could

dance with her. i have done so before,

a shard of my concoction who had no sentience,

who abides still behind the veil. i will find him no matter how much

automation or experimentation it takes. a version of me is not complete

without a version of everyone i’ve ever known, living. or maybe we are

the unalived ones. the undead. what an interesting label, no?

how does the world beyond change you till you cease to be yourself? how does

the world beyond cease to be a part of ours? how do you walk backwards

and still arrive at your previous destination? i suggested once to my mother

that all human beings secretly enjoy suffering. it was a philosophical notion

and not to be taken at face value. my mother asked me 

if my ailing grandfather, his life grasped in the folds of his throat,

enjoyed suffering? free men. free men.

how do i cease to be myself? am i to cease to be the one they know

so i can free myself? how often have they freed themselves

to a dog’s tooth replica of a saint? somehow, the houses have grown legs

and are off to the coffee house. my bracelets and fine things have

grown wings and are on voyage to china. i forget you, in that most

heart-breaking manner. the movement of your absence moves me 

to the rhythm of its ceasing and unceasing. you alone 

dance in this abandoned residence. the dollar bills i’ve earnt

is clutched between your teeth. our publications are moving volume and

my strange ideas are painted onto the walls. the strange woman 

we knew, i knew all those years ago

has climbed herself back, past the veil, yet not

truly transcended… she sends me messages now,

arranges meet-ups and tea sessions. 

each and every last person in my cabinet

is clawing out of me, demanding to be free.

I've been a tech lead at several companies. My resume is pretty nice but I've struggled a lot with interpersonal relationships. So much that I really don't have that much of a network after all these years.

I'm 54 and just got my ASD diagnosis a few weeks ago, so I finally have some answers on why I've struggled with building relationships. It has honestly been a mystery to me all this time. I recognized there was some kind of problem but had no real idea what I was doing wrong. Had a pretty bad mental health breakdown 2 years ago and left my job about 14 months ago. Haven't tried to find a new gig until now.

Now I want to transition to managing a small to medium team of some kind of computer nerds. Hopefully developers. I have a strong technical base so I can easily pick up enough about whatever job my team is doing. Enough that I can probably be a help to them fairly quickly.

But I want/need things to be different with coworker relationships. I've learned enough about ASD now to understand I'm going to have to put effort and thought into building relationships. Which means the dreaded small talk and all that.

So, after over explaining all the above, here's my question(s) to anyone with Aspergers who is managing people. How much effort do you actually put into getting to know your peers? Do you force yourself to stop at the coffee machine and initiate conversations? Do you have any tips on how you navigate the world at work?

Also, does anyone have any good suggestions on leadership books I should read or free/cheap training I could take to help me out when I interview?",1,1766856941.0,autism,1,1.0,False

1px3gdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/badreviewer/comments/1px3gdc/this_little_espresso_machine_actually_makes/,This little espresso machine actually makes decent lattes without hogging my tiny kitchen counter!,"Been wanting an espresso machine for ages but my kitchen counter space is basically non-existent. Stumbled across the [**CASABREWS CM5418**](https://amzn.to/3N3nMfD) on Amazon during a sale (got it for $118, down from $139!) and figured, why not? It promised to be compact and had some solid reviews, so I took the plunge. I've had it for about a week now, making at least one, sometimes two, drinks a day, and I'm ready to share my thoughts.

# First Impressions & Setup

Out of the box, this thing is surprisingly sleek. The stainless steel finish looks way better than I expected for the price, and it truly is compact – fits perfectly into a little nook I have. Setting it up was pretty straightforward, even for a beginner like me. The 34oz removable water tank is a nice touch, makes refilling less of a hassle. The manual is clear enough to get you started on pulling your first shot. I appreciate the visual pressure gauge; it's kinda satisfying to watch it hit the sweet spot.

# Brewing Experience & The Steam Wand

Okay, so the main event: the espresso. For a machine in this price range, the espresso shots are surprisingly good! I'm getting a decent crema, and the taste is rich, not burnt or watery. The 20-bar pump definitely does its job. You can adjust the shot volume too, which is handy if you like a stronger or weaker base.  
  
Now, the steam wand. This was my biggest concern. I'm no barista, but I wanted to at least attempt some latte art. The [**CASABREWS CM5418**](https://amzn.to/3N3nMfD)'s wand rotates 360 degrees and, while it's not the most powerful thing in the world, with a bit of practice, I've managed to get some surprisingly silky microfoam! It takes a *little* longer than a high-end machine, but it absolutely gets the job done for a creamy cappuccino or latte. I'm actually shocked I'm making drinks this good at home.

# Is the CASABREWS CM5418 worth it?

Absolutely, especially if you snag it on sale like I did. This isn't going to rival a $1000+ machine, but for less than $120, the [**CASABREWS CM5418**](https://amzn.to/3N3nMfD) delivers solid espresso and a functional steam wand in a compact, stylish package. It's a fantastic entry-level machine for anyone looking to ditch the coffee shop habit without breaking the bank or sacrificing all their counter space. My only real gripe is the noise, but honestly, it's a small price to pay for good coffee at home. It's truly been a great upgrade for my morning routine.

# The Good Stuff 👍

* Super compact and fits well in small kitchens
* Stylish stainless steel design looks more expensive than it is
* 20-bar pump pulls surprisingly good espresso shots with nice crema
* Steam wand works well for creating microfoam (with practice!)
* Removable 34oz water tank is convenient for refilling and cleaning
* Heated cup holder is a nice touch for keeping cups warm
* PID temperature control helps ensure consistent brewing temperature

# The Not-So-Good Stuff 👎

* Can be a bit loud and vibrates during brewing
* Steam wand pressure is a little low, so frothing takes some time
* Takes a bit to heat up initially
* Some internal/accessory parts feel a bit plasticky/aluminum

I’m a woman in my 40s living in NW Tucson and realizing it’s way harder to make friends as an adult than it should be.

I work in tech as a UX designer / software engineer (accessibility) and spend my free time doing a mix of creative and chill stuff — photography, woodworking, 3D printing, gardening, home projects, checking out local spots, and hanging out with my cats Mogwai, Butters, and El Boris, plus my rescue axolotl, Big Mama. I also enjoy the occasional hike or Mt. Lemmon drive when the weather cooperates.

I’m married with a teenage daughter, so my life is a mix of family time and carving out space for myself. Not a big party person — more coffee, walks, casual dinners, and low-pressure hangs. Neurodivergent and 420-friendly.

I’m open to making both male and female friends, and would especially love to connect with people who enjoy talking about design and product development, 3D printing, and gardening (or just learning about those things together).

Age doesn’t really matter, but I tend to relate best to Gen X and older millennials. Couples, singles, parents, non-parents — all good. Mostly just looking for genuine friendships.

If you’re also feeling like “wow, adult friendships are so weird,” feel free to comment or DM. Bonus points if you like coffee or want to do a plant propagation swap.

(funnysad story),"Hi all, I wanted to share a little story from my past, hope it's alright to do it here. Also for me it's the possibility to do a bit of fun/creative writing.

Background:  
M37, story is from when I was in high school in the 2000s. Bear in mind that I had no idea that I could be on the spectrum back then. This is one of those ""in hindsight"" stories.

Story:  
Back in the day, high school life was hard for me for all the usual reasons you can imagine. One of my venting/safe spaces were video games after school. I played management and strategy games (loved the systems and optimization of stuff) and also RPGs (yay, I can pretend to be somebody relevant and cool).  
One day somebody showed me a new game. That was The Sims 1. And it looked pretty interesting - unlike anything before. The person lent me the game and I started to set up a dude and his house (although my computer struggled to run the game properly, it was a pretty weak computer).  
So, life begins for Dude in his new little house. The house is pretty basic. Dude needs money. Therefore, Dude needs to find a job (I don't remember how it worked exactly, I think there were some job offers in the daily newspaper?). Dude gets lowest-rank available job in the Town Hall.  
Dude begins his 9-to-5 job. It quickly becomes apparent that to achieve progress in his Town Hall (actually Politics) career, he needs something called Charisma. And Charisma is obtained by practicing speech and oratory in front of a Mirror. Therefore, a Mirror is acquired for this purpose.  
Days pass. Dude settled in an optimized routine: sleep - coffee - job - charisma training in front of the mirror - dinner, repeat. Bigger and bigger paychecks come as Dude rises up the ladder. But Dude doesn't have big needs - just a more efficient bed for rest, a more efficient coffee machine for coffee, a more efficient mirror for charisma training, and a more efficient kitchen for dinner-making. Otherwise it's still the same little house from before.  
In the meanwhile, a cute girl from the neighborhood knocks on Dude's door to invite him to something. Maybe a birthday party? But Dude is above such things. Opening the door would distract him from his training routine and have no effect to advance his career goals. Therefore Dude ignores his neighbors and continues his life alone, in the safety of his steady routine.  
Promotion after promotion comes. Finally, instead of a dirty taxi, it's a shining black stretched limousine that comes every morning to pick Dude to his job. Dude has obtained maximum Charisma and has been promoted to President of the United States.  
There are no career goals left as this was the end for the Politics route.  
There is nothing left to do in the game.  
I felt sad and never played the game again, feeling that I had missed something but didn't know what.  
The End.

TLDR: I used The Sims to create a super-Hitler character with inhuman charisma and oratory skills and zero friends to run the USA with the iron fist of logic and optimization because I didn't understand what the game was about.",2,1766856732.0,autism,3,1.0,False

Over the last few days I’ve been traveling and couldn’t bring the kettle with me, so I’ve been heating water with a simple milk kettle instead. The results have been terrible: I can’t get much above \~1.0% TDS with some Ethiopian beans, whereas at home—with the gooseneck—I can easily reach \~1.4% TDS, even without using boiling water.

Since this is essentially the only variable that changed (aside from the water, which I doubt has such a large impact on extraction), it really seems like the kettle makes a huge difference. That said, I’m surprised this factor is often downplayed in videos by coffee experts like Hoffmann, Hedrick, etc. What’s your opinion on it?",3,1766856507.0,pourover,9,0.8,False
1px3byu,https://www.reddit.com/r/NEET/comments/1px3byu/i_fucking_love_being_a_neet_with_money_not_a_neet/,I fucking love being a NEET with money (not a NEET by choice),"I don't look forward to living in an ordinary place anymore or getting housemates. I have gotten really spoiled. I had 4 years of living alone in a ""luxury"" apartment unit in the downtown of a city while being mostly unemployed nor in school, not waking up to an alarm clock, going to a doctor or physical therapist twice a week or whenever I want, eating whatever I want (healthy stuff), and having money... it just let me pretty much be a child at peace for 4 years. 4 years of nothingness that I never got to have. I wonder if all the 2 hours of just sitting in the morning doing nothing but drinking coffee or hot chocolate while scrolling articles on the computer were good for me... instead of rushing to work 5 days a week. No rushing at all. For 4 years. I had a chaotic and unstable childhood and adult life, I have been moving place to place every 1-2 years since I was a child. Then I got to a downtown apartment and stayed here since then. I have never stayed at one place for over 3 years in my life.

Yeah I guess I can get a full time white collar job, but then a lot of my neighbors in this building wake up to an alarm clock and work 40+ hours a week, 8 hours a day 5 days a week, in an office somewhere and don't even spend time in the units they pay for here. I did. Not working is such a privilege. I can't imagine going back or how people endure this for 40 years. Holy fuck. What a scam. No wonder people cope and moralize about how work gives their life meaning and is ""interesting"" and keeps them active and how they ""still have free time after getting off work and coming home at 5:30pm"".

Since I am not bound by anything, I spent time flying around traveling to Colorado or Mexico or Asia because I am not bound by a job. Weeks and months on end where I had no commitments and I just figure out what to do with the day. Nights in my $3000/month downtown city apartment I had to myself where I don't have to accomodate a roommate or have roommate drama, and laying there relaxing with shrooms or THC edibles while under purple lights and munching on cheetos and watching childhood shows. I flew out last-minute to Texas to spend a week with my ""adopted grandma"" on her deathbed who took me in 10 years ago when I was homeless, and I would not have been able to do that if I had a job or school. I was the only non-family members of hers who showed up because everyone else was tied to jobs or didn't have money to travel.

The older I get the more I appreciate not having to work, and understand people who want to win the lottery or marry rich so they don't have to work.

**Because some people will wonder:** How did I get money? From investments. I have no friends or family, my family disowned me long time ago after trying to kill me. I am in my early 30s and only worked 4 years in my life full time, and that was in the military. I am sure the only reason I stayed that long in one job is because people can't just fire you willy nilly in the military unless you do something egregious, and trust me, my NCOs and other people were trying to get my pushed out all the time - especially by having an ""intervention"" talk where the sergeants are holding hands and talking at me slowly suggesting I have ADHD or autism, but I just wasn't bad enough for them to flag me with anything, I was pretty unscandalous and maybe I was a little slow but not to the point that they can do anything about it. I was in the military during the COVID pandemic and was saving as much as I can, and when the stocks tanked, I put in all my cash because I decided if it's the end of the world, then I will have bigger problems than losing all my money in the stock market anyway. Then, the stocks shot back up, and I got a lot of capital gains as a result. I am still living off my investments because I wasn't able to get a job since I left the military despite having a college degree and work experience, nobody wants to hire me. Will this last forever? No, this won't last forever and I need to get income soon. I've been fired from two jobs for being ""slow"" and ""low performing"" the past 2 years.",3,1766856467.0,NEET,6,1.0,False

I'm never going to get to say this to you, but I wanted to write you anyway. We both know why I won't say anything to you, but it eats me alive every night when I can't sleep. You've got insomnia, too. I hope it isn't because of me. Work is rough enough as it is; you don't need my feelings to complicate it more.   
  
You know, I only started doing those things at work to get to spend time with you. To get to know you. Part of me had hoped I would find something I didn't like, something to convince myself to let it go and find another to yearn for. To convince myself that we are just coworkers. I've been failing miserably at that for two years now. Maybe one day. Maybe not.   
  
I re-read our messages sometimes. I feel like an idiot while I do it. I smile when it's obvious you remembered something about me, something small that I said months ago. I wish I had gotten to know you somewhere else. I wish I had found you somewhere that wasn't this stupid job. Why do we like the same things? Every time you say something, you push me a little deeper. I don't want to say I'm in love with you, that's loaded, heavy, complicated. I know you don't feel the way I do; you can't, it's just not feasible. You have your life together, you're attractive, you're talented, how has nobody else seen that? How are you single? How are you not married yet?

Why do you give me music suggestions? Shows to watch? Why do you torture me by remembering what I prefer to be called and using that exclusively? Nobody else here does that. Why do you laugh at my stupid jokes? Why do you make references in meetings and wait for me to react so you can say you knew I'd pick up on it? Do you know you made me cry by sending that holiday email with my name just the way I like it? Why did you say you'd go to my event?  

You tell everyone that you make it a point to remember things about people you work with. It's sweet, and if nothing else, I appreciate it. That's how I know none of this means anything deeper than you being a genuinely good person. Do you know how badly I wish it did? Do you know how badly I want nothing more than to make you coffee in the morning while you brush your hair so it sits the way you like it? To go hunting together for vintage, obscure metal albums at the record store downtown? To binge-watch that anime you love, even if it means I have to get used to subtitles? To compare video game strategies? I want to go out for sushi so you can poke fun at me for liking tamago the most. I want you to feel as seen as you've made me feel. 

I wish you could be mine and that any of this meant the same to you as it does to me. Please keep being a good person.

I got my friend a lot of thoughtful gifts that aligned with her personality and everything she likes like color I know she loves the color, pink and likes all things coquette I even picked out fragrances, knowing what she likes, and I spent a lot of time picking out gift bags and drawing art on the cards where her name goes on the two and from spot because I wanted it to be extra cute and special I even got her boyfriend a gift because she had kept asking me what my fiancé wants for Christmas so I figured we where getting each others partner something nice aswell. She ended up getting my partner nothing while we got hers something. As for my gifts, she bought me three things that I liked a Victoria’s Secret pajama set Victoria’s Secret lip gloss, and a tiny plate for my jewelry, all of the other things where literally used makeup for ur lips, a hot coco packet, and dollar tree items and expired protein bar from her pantry and when I take it out of the bag, she says yeah girl I can’t do that protein stuff, but I know you can and two NYX lingere lip liners that were used heavily without packaging and a candle that she said that she hated this smell too and a perfume that she has previously told me she hated  and didn’t like the way it smelled and looked at me and asked me if I like the smell of them… it’s like she walked around her house with the bag and was just tossing stuff in that she didn’t want…of course I said yes because I wanted to be grateful…mind u I had no job and made it happen with all new thoughtful gifts thanks to my fiancé. She has a full time job and was hyping up how she got me so much stuff for Christmas and how I am going to love it and told me that she’s going all out and when I was over at her house pointed to a huge pile of gifts and said my gifts are there mind you when I did the gift exchange there was one bag for me that’s it and it wasn’t a gift bag. It was a bag from the store where she bought me the jewelry plate. And for the past two months Had me drive her around while gift shopping for all her other friends and she was buying them all new thoughtful stuff and continued telling me she was so excited for me to see my Christmas stuff…. And it’s almost like every time we hang out, she asks me to take her somewhere she does not have a car and I do and she has never offered gas ever. I’m a full-time student and I don’t work and my fiancé pays my gas and she’s fully aware of this and still has never offered. Sometimes she will offer to pay for coffee, but never really further than that.🫩  I’m going to give an example from the day we did our gift exchange as soon as we finished opening gifts? I asked her if she wanted to go on a walk outside and she said sure we get down the road two minutes outside she says ugh. It’s too hot. Let’s just go to the mall, mind you she has no car her boyfriend with a car is home and could easily take her…. she then proceeds to talk about how she needs to go to the store. That’s inside the mall and pick up two necklaces that she didn’t get for Christmas like she wanted. And how she needs to pick up a few more things from the mall and how I can leave her there because she’s going to hang out with another girl after we’re done hanging out at two. So she calls this other girl and the other girl has no interest in hanging out with her so she’s like oh man all my friends aren’t available. And I have to leave at two so I’m thinking she’s going to Uber home but she starts walking out to the car with me and I have to take her home because I don’t wanna feel like a terrible friend for leaving her. At this point honestly feels like I’m just being used, but my heart wants to believe that she’s a good person, but I think I am ready to end the friendship.

How are you all? 
I’m here seeking guidance on a friend of mine.,
A little backstory is we’ve always been some at flirty, talked in depth and all, until it came to not hearing from them for a month or so. They would bounce back and forth with messaging me; and I’m a patient person but after a while I felt- lousy? The thing being; if I’m flirting with you like heavily it’s with the intent of dating or working in that direction.
With this person; they are fearful avoidant, they do not think highly of themselves and while I’m here thinking the world of them. 

They like to flirt, sometimes a bit more which makes me feel for but kind of sad knowing it might not go anywhere where they confessed they liked me, but has a hard time being with people. 

This was a lonnnng time ago, but now I noticed after putting boundaries on me putting distance, I noticed them to reel back, now saying they want to talk to me and have been sweeter on me. 


Still-while I know I can’t rush a relationship or the way someone feels about me, I needed to find control when it came to a common ground. I feel like they are keeping me on the hook to keep me close but not enough to label it which is something I do not want anymore of. I was putting aside my boundaries for this person to feel comfy, because I liked them soo much!

I did do a sweetening sugar jar, fresh rose petals, Damiana, catnip, fresh carnations, basil, cinnamon, cloves, hibiscus, lavender, and coffee grounds with almond and honey flavoring with a petition. I’ve been lighting it and all, and after a while I’ll top it off with honey. 

Now again, I’ve heard with certain attachments you can’t and shouldn’t put like a certain spell on them, but layer is best? I’m just wanting to know if anyone else had their own journey with something similar? I’m not asking for pointers or tips just some stories on how it went for you!

1px30hb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1px30hb,Got my Xbox Ally X in Vietnam 2 weeks early… and now my “wasted time” is gone,"I preordered an Xbox Ally X in Vietnam… and it showed up way early

I ordered from the ASUS Vietnam official website on Oct 3 and somehow received it on Oct 15 — about two weeks before the Vietnam street date I expected (Oct 30).

Not gonna lie, it felt like I got a tiny VIP pass into the handheld future.

Price in Vietnam: 24,990,000 VND (~$960)
(rough math at ~26,000 VND = $1 — please don’t roast me if your bank rate is different 😅)

Also came with the free ROG Xbox Ally Premium Case, which immediately made it feel like a real “throw it in the bag” travel device, not some fragile gadget I’d baby forever.

---

Why I’m actually posting: I love this device and I use it every single day ever since I got it!!!!

- I’ve owned a powerful ROG Strix G513 3070 Ti. I’ve owned a PS5 Pro. And somehow… none of them changed my day-to-day like this thing has.

 The Ally X isn’t just “gaming on the go.”

It turned all those annoying dead moments into my time again:
- Supermarket line? Hotspot on → one Battlefield 6 match → cashier starts scanning
- Café break? One mission, one coffee, zero guilt
- Bus ride? Headphones on, Steam Big Picture, disappear from reality
- Mountain with no Wi-Fi? Still gaming. Still chilling. Still feels unreal.


I added a few photos because it’s hard to explain the freedom until you see it outside, actually living life like a normal device.

My “Vietnam handheld life” setup (I went full nerd on day 1)

VRAM: set to 10GB

Storage upgrade: SN7100 4TB SSD + JEYI 6mm heatsink (fits perfectly)

microSD: 1TB Extreme Pro

I’m not really an Xbox App guy, so I basically live in Steam Big Picture

Cleaned out a bunch of default Microsoft apps/games

Currently at 133 installed games and it’s been stable for me

---

Honest note on thermals / “Windows handheld drama”

If you’re still on the stock SSD and you play heavy stuff a lot… I’d honestly consider upgrading.

Before my SSD + heatsink setup, it ran hotter and I had more classic Windows handheld nonsense (random crashes / driver weirdness). After upgrading, it’s been way more consistent for me.

(Not saying everyone needs to mod — just sharing what changed it for me.)

---

My guilty pleasure combo: Battlefield 6 + 5G hotspot

Battlefield on a handheld sounds like a meme until you actually do it.

Then you realize you’re literally carrying chaos in your backpack.
If you’ve ever wanted something that feels console-like while still being a real PC, this is it.

---

Luckiest accessory deal I’ve ever gotten (dbrand story)

I got stupid lucky and grabbed a dbrand Killswitch Ultra package (Obsidian + Triple Black skin) from a local seller who was reselling after he sold his Ally X.

Retail: $99.80 (before shipping/tax)

Vietnam shipping/tax can be brutal (I’ve seen it balloon toward ~$300 landed, depending on route)

So I paid: 1,300,000 VND (~$50)
That purchase genuinely felt like a real-life epic loot drop.

---

I didn’t expect a handheld to feel emotional, but it genuinely does.
Now when I’m commuting, waiting, or traveling, I catch myself thinking: “Cool. Free time.”

If this post helped, made you smile, or convinced you to touch grass less efficiently… I won’t say no to an upvote.

But we are not totally best of friends it’s just that we are in the same circle of friends. For quite some time I never really thought of her (my friend) differently not until me and my gf became officially together. She’s (gf) always jealous when I am with that friend (we are usually hanging out with groups) I couldn’t distance myself since it would mean that I would distance myself with everyone as well. 

During those times, I slowly became more observant with her (friend) actions/interactions with me. Well first of all she’s straight (actively looking for someone) I even push her towards the guy who has been trying to date her. It was around the time I introduced my gf to my friends when she started to voice out her interest in trying to date. What confused me is that there has always been this tension between us that I couldn’t explain (I couldn’t feel this certain thing with other girl friends) I’d always have a kind of special treatment from her and one time me and our friends were joking about kissing when she told me “halikan kita diyan” which turned heads from our friends. Moments like that made me confused and have more of this weird feelings towards her.

After few months of not seeing each other and talking, she reached out to me. Asking if I want to grab coffee with our friends. It was unusual as she’s not the type of friend to do that. Ever since, we’d chat randomly well not consistently but it was a casual talk which I am not used to. And she started sending airfare to various countries insisting we should go abroad. Well ofc its not just us but I am just not really used to it, and suddenly that weird feelings went back. I feel really bad because I have a gf and I know it is bad. 

I won’t really do anything about it but idk how to stop this feeling. I also won’t pursue her even if I am single since I know she is straight.

Love it so far and working my way up to my 5 miles to work, however within the couple days I already see places to make some upgrades.


1st Is turn signals, I live in California, LA county, the valley more specifically. Thankfully within the valley there's a lot of residential neighborhoods, but theres also between them, lots of stroads, busy intersections and I get extremely nervous and awkward because drivers don't know where I'm going. Anyone know good turn signal recommendations?



2nd is bars, I have a trek fx 1 and I now understand in bike reviews talk so much about hand positioning, the flat ish bars are nice, but there's very little room for mounting stuff and 1 hand position. Maybe my hands will get used to it, but they ache a little when I'm riding,  easing the tension and bending my elbows helped a bit, but I'd still want a little more variety.


3rd is a rack specifically a front one, to load my lunch bag for work, food or coffee when I'm off or for the weekend or little errands here and there. I got bread the other day and awkwardly carried it on my handlebars, along with another day stopping by my place because I forgot my lunch bag, and having to ride it slinged over my shoulder, never again lol


4th is best U locks and component security. This is another issue I face, right now I have a kryptonite chain the bike shop sold to me, but I know they're pretty weak compared to a ulock, and I've noticed when parked I get real nervous, and I hate having to check my bike when I'm waiting for my order at McDonald's.


On security and parking, for those who live in merica, we know bike infrastructure is ass. Thankfully in LA I believe we're having the Olympics, and so LA is overhauling and trying to get more bike infrastructure but until then where do y'all park? ",2,1766855531.0,bikecommuting,6,0.75,False

How are you all? 
I’m here seeking guidance on a friend of mine.,
A little backstory is we’ve always been some at flirty, talked in depth and all, until it came to not hearing from them for a month or so. They would bounce back and forth with messaging me; and I’m a patient person but after a while I felt- lousy? The thing being; if I’m flirting with you like heavily it’s with the intent of dating or working in that direction.
With this person; they are fearful avoidant, they do not think highly of themselves and while I’m here thinking the world of them. 

They like to flirt, sometimes a bit more which makes me feel for but kind of sad knowing it might not go anywhere where they confessed they liked me, but has a hard time being with people. 

This was a lonnnng time ago, but now I noticed after putting boundaries on me putting distance, I noticed them to reel back, now saying they want to talk to me and have been sweeter on me. 


Still-while I know I can’t rush a relationship or the way someone feels about me, I’m looking for more of a persuasion? I feel like they are keeping me on the hook to keep me close but not enough to label it which is something I do not want anymore of. 

I did do a sweetening sugar jar, fresh rose petals, Damiana, catnip, fresh carnations, basil, cinnamon, cloves, hibiscus, lavender, and coffee grounds with almond and honey flavoring with a petition. I’ve been lighting it and all, and after a while I’ll top it off with honey. But I want to know any tips you have ? 

Now again, I’ve heard with certain attachments you can’t and shouldn’t put like a certain spell on them, but layer is best? But I’m hoping for more of a solid foundation with this person rather than just being someone they flirt with then they want or be spicy with.

Here’s what I learned the hard way:

* Paper notes are risky. Napkins get lost, coffee spills happen, memory fails.
* Even a simple system saves deals. A basic CRM or note app keeps you on track.
* Small mistakes = big losses. One napkin, one missed follow-up, five grand down the drain.

Lesson learned: always capture contact info somewhere safe and searchable. My phone or CRM is now my first stop for new leads, even if it’s just a quick jot.

From the smart coffee maker waiting for your voice command to the OLED TV in ""quick start"" mode, your house is likely filled with Energy Vampires.These are devices that draw ""phantom loads""—electricity consumed even when they are supposedly turned off. In 2026, with fluctuating energy rates and the rise of time-of-use pricing, these phantoms can quietly add $150 to $250 to your annual utility bill.The good news? The same technology that created the problem is now smart enough to fix it. Here is how to conduct a 2026-style Smart Home Audit.1. The Usual Suspects: Where the Phantoms HideA 2026 home audit begins by identifying the high-drain devices that never truly sleep.The Entertainment Hub: Between the soundbar, the game console (in ""Rest Mode""), and the smart TV, this cluster can draw up to 50 watts of continuous standby power.The Home Office: Printers, secondary monitors, and docking stations are notorious ""always-on"" culprits.""Remote-Ready"" Appliances: Modern microwaves with LED clocks or air fryers with Wi-Fi connectivity are constantly ""listening"" for signals, sipping power 24/7.2. Using 2026 Energy Monitoring AppsForget the old ""Kill A Watt"" handheld meters of the past. Today’s audit is done via smartphone.Whole-Home Monitors: Tools like Sense or Emporia now use AI to identify the unique ""electrical signature"" of every appliance in your house. By clamping onto your electrical panel, these apps can tell you exactly when your toaster is drawing power and, more importantly, how much your ""idle"" house is costing you per hour.Matter-Enabled Dashboards: With the 2026 maturity of the Matter smart home standard, your Apple Home, Google Gemini, or Alexa app can now aggregate energy data from multiple different brands into one single ""Energy Health Score.""3. The ""Smart Plug"" DefenseIn 2026, smart plugs have evolved from simple timers into Active Load Controllers.Zero-Draw Scheduling: Use plugs like the TP-Link Kasa KP125M to set ""Hard Off"" schedules. For example, your home office can be programmed to physically disconnect from the grid at 8 p.m. and reconnect at 8 a.m., ensuring zero phantom draw overnight.Master/Slave Logic: Modern smart power strips can detect when a ""Master"" device (like your TV) is turned off and automatically kill the power to ""Slave"" devices (like the DVD player or game console), slaying the whole vampire nest at once.4. The 2026 Audit Checklist: A 30-Minute RoutineTaskTool NeededPotential Annual SavingIdentify Idle LoadWhole-home app (Sense/Emporia)$50 - $100Set Office CurfewSmart Plug$30 - $50Disable ""Instant On""Device Settings (TV/Xbox/PS5)$25 - $40Group Peripheral PowerSmart Power Strip$40 - $60The ""Set It and Forget It"" FutureThe goal of a 2026 audit isn't to live in the dark; it's to ensure your home is only ""awake"" when you are.

So.. I have a coworker-friend called Georgia who is 12 years older than me (im 27) We have worked together for about three years in different departments, and everyone at work knows we are really close. 

We take our breaks together, constantly find each other during shifts, and have loads of inside jokes. Colleagues joke that we are inseparable or tell us to “stop flirting,” which we always laugh off.
Georgia is Eastern European and very reserved and private shes also extremely shy and quite anxious.

She does not open up easily to people. We joke all the time that we “cannot be nice to each other” at work because that would look suspicious, so instead we tease, blame, and bully each other playfully. We say being mean “looks better,” and we constantly joke, “we are just colleagues, remember.”
A lot of our interaction is silly back-and-forth banter. We literally order each other around as a joke. She will say things like “Get me a coffee, thanks,” and I will respond with “Why should I, huh?” Or she will tell me to make her a coffee and I will say, “Say please and I might consider it,” and she will bat her eyelashes and go, “Pleeeease, Luuuuuuce?” It is all very unserious and mutual, but very visible to other people.

She often asks when I am working next and checks my schedule, and when we are in together we naturally gravitate toward each other without really trying.

She has two young kids. I am not a very kid-oriented person and she knows that, but I genuinely like her kids and they seem to really like me too. Over the last couple of years I have spent a lot of time with her and the kids doing things like bowling, going to cafés, Halloween trick-or-treating, and Christmas markets two years in a row. A lot of these were first-time experiences for them.

 The kids know me by name, ask about me, get excited when my name is mentioned, and sometimes assume I am coming over. She has told me they miss me, and this year they even made me a Christmas card with a heart.

English is not her first language, and joking about it is a big part of our dynamic. I tease her when she gets words wrong, she laughs and pretends to be offended, and she calls me her “English teacher.” She also jokes that I am a bad influence because I teach her swear words. 

This year she also wrote me a Christmas card that said “Thanks for the English lessons this year” and gave me my favourite chocolate bar, something I had only mentioned off-hand a few weeks earlier.


She tells me a lot about her personal life and her relationship, which she is unhappy in. When something stressful happens, I am usually the first person she reaches out to. Once she messaged me at 5am and later said she never messages anyone at that time except her “bestie.”

At work there is also a lot of playful physical stuff like joking hits, arm slaps, hair pulling, blaming me for everything, and holding eye contact longer than necessary. Other colleagues notice it and joke about us, and we joke that people are going to “talk about us.”
Recently, we finally hung out just the two of us without the kids, which she was a bit shy about at first but agreed to after a lot of joking back and forth.

At the Christmas market this year, she took her son to meet Santa for the first time ever. I waited outside while they went in. Afterward, she said that she wanted me to come in with them. I didn't know how to react so I just laughed and said maybe the dad should do it and she rolled her eyes. 

What confuses me is the overall intensity of it all, especially involving the kids.

What the hell do I do.,"Okay so for starters i F19 work in a restaurant BOH(kitchen) specifically and my co worker let's call him Josh 21M works as a bartender in the FOH 

Josh likes me. And I do know that, he is always in the back/kitchen and always tries to make small talk that turns into him staying for a while talking to me when it isn't busy. 


On top of that he is always smiling and never lets me carry anything heavy. On what I am thankful for, but in regard to us talking there's never been anything romantic as far as I'm aware. 

He is a really nice guy, I do want to add that too. 

A little while ago he asked if I wanted to go to a cafe and continue talking there since we do seem to have many similar topics and I agreed.

It would all be very casual we'd talk then pay for drinks, and go catch the bus. 

However. 

Last night we went to a cafe again for a coffee and a talk, after work around 4pm. Then around 7pm we went to the bus station, bought our tickets and outside I spotted my friend from middle school 

I immediately went and greeted him and we had a quick little chat before he asked who this was, and just as I was about to introduce josh. 

This man and I kid you not. 
Goes: 

""hi! I'm Hanna's boyfriend. Nice to meet you!"" 
..? 

The fuck? Boyfriend??? What.? When did this happen. 

We were ABSOLUTELY NEVER, even talking about relationships besides the fact of me mentioning I'm happy to be single at work? 

I was shocked but my friend was beyond excited and started talking to josh and asked questions such as

""Oh my gosh no way, how is your relationship going? I never knew you were dating.. "" 

Josh goes on a rant about how I'm the best thing that has ever happened to him and at this point my jaw is on the floor. 


Like.. What's going on? Is he making up a lie for some reason? It's strange. But


I'm genuinely confused. My friend assumed it's true, and didn't question it

Then our bus came and we just walked in, sat down and he answered a from I'm not sure who and talk for a little while, by then (since my bus station isn't far) I was leaving the bus and just said ""byee.."" and left the bus then he replied cheerful bye!!! 


I know I should've confronted him. But I'm weirded out by this, if it was a joke, shouldn't he have said it in the bus? Or at least texted to let me know if was a joke? 

How do I act on this. Do I ""break up"" over text or do I really have to break his delusions irl. 

I will also say, at work everyone acts as if we are together even though I dismiss it. They are teasing but I think that may be where it all roots... I'm not sure how to confront this. 


As I had a similar situation to where genuinely rejecting a guy in the past let to stalking, and it creeps me out to think about.

1px2o0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1px2o0g/is_my_friend_being_friendly_or_crossing_boundaries/,Is my friend being ...friendly? Or crossing boundaries?,"

So.. I have a coworker-friend called Georgia who is 12 years older than me (im 27) We have worked together for about three years in different departments, and everyone at work knows we are really close. 

We take our breaks together, constantly find each other during shifts, and have loads of inside jokes. Colleagues joke that we are inseparable or tell us to “stop flirting,” which we always laugh off.

Georgia is Eastern European and very reserved and private shes also extremely shy and quite anxious. She has a boyfriend and 2 kids. 

She does not open up easily to people. We joke all the time that we “cannot be nice to each other” at work because that would look suspicious, so instead we tease, blame, and bully each other playfully. We say being mean “looks better,” and we constantly joke, “we are just colleagues, remember.”
A lot of our interaction is silly back-and-forth banter. We literally order each other around as a joke. She will say things like “Get me a coffee, thanks,” and I will respond with “Why should I, huh?” Or she will tell me to make her a coffee and I will say, “Say please and I might consider it,” and she will bat her eyelashes and go, “Pleeeease, Luuuuuuce?” It is all very unserious and mutual, but very visible to other people.

She often asks when I am working next and checks my schedule, and when we are in together we naturally gravitate toward each other without really trying.

She has two young kids. I am not a very kid-oriented person and she knows that, but I genuinely like her kids and they seem to really like me too. Over the last couple of years I have spent a lot of time with her and the kids doing things like bowling, going to cafés, Halloween trick-or-treating, and Christmas markets two years in a row. A lot of these were first-time experiences for them.

 The kids know me by name, ask about me, get excited when my name is mentioned, and sometimes assume I am coming over. She has told me they miss me, and this year they even made me a Christmas card with a heart.

English is not her first language, and joking about it is a big part of our dynamic. I tease her when she gets words wrong, she laughs and pretends to be offended, and she calls me her “English teacher.” She also jokes that I am a bad influence because I teach her swear words. 

This year she also wrote me a Christmas card that said “Thanks for the English lessons this year” and gave me my favourite chocolate bar, something I had only mentioned off-hand a few weeks earlier.


She tells me a lot about her personal life and her relationship, which she is unhappy in. When something stressful happens, I am usually the first person she reaches out to. Once she messaged me at 5am and later said she never messages anyone at that time except her “bestie.”

At work there is also a lot of playful physical stuff like joking hits, arm slaps, hair pulling, blaming me for everything, and holding eye contact longer than necessary. Other colleagues notice it and joke about us, and we joke that people are going to “talk about us.”
Recently, we finally hung out just the two of us without the kids, which she was a bit shy about at first but agreed to after a lot of joking back and forth.

At the Christmas market this year, she took her son to meet Santa for the first time ever. I waited outside while they went in. Afterward, she said that she wanted me to come in with them. I didn't know how to react so I just laughed and said maybe the dad should do it and she rolled her eyes. 

What confuses me is the overall intensity of it all, especially involving the kids. I did not expect to become such a familiar person in her children’s lives, and sometimes I wonder why their dad does not do these things with them, which she usually brushes off. Idk what to do.

I don't smoke or do drugs so I want someone who doesn't do that as well.
If we vibe and can hold a conversation, I am sure that we'll thrive.


I spend some of my time reading manhwa and playing games like Fortnite, Battlefront 2, or 2K. I'm also big on sports,  enjoy watching NBA games, my favorite team is the Minnesota Timberwolves. I also play basketball recreationally. Every once in a while I like getting out of my home for nature walks or just throwing on a nature documentary when I want to chill. It'd be cool to meet someone who's into at least some of that stuff, or at least doesn't think I'm boring for it. Bonus points if you're willing to run a few games together or shoot around sometime.

I am ideally looking for someone who wants to chat first, grab some coffee, and see what happens from there. I do love some flirty banter to keep things interesting. I usually probe before actually committing to the banter to see where we are at. I won't randomly do this.

If you're actually interested and want to talk and you live somewhere in the DFW metroplex or closer to Wiley, send me a message (not a one word or one sentence message). Tell me something about yourself like I have to you here, what you've been up to lately, or what you like to do for fun. Just give me something to work with so we can actually get a conversation going. 

We can share pics once we star talking, I'm looking forward to hearing from you guys.

1px2kbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1px2kbs/why_were_financially_broke/,Why we’re financially broke,"I’ve been a non-profit community personal finance educator and counselor for 7 years. Here’s something I need people to know. The worst personal finance wisdom I hear and read is this: You pay for too many streaming services and stop buying a daily coffee. If you stop spending on these things you’ll be rich!!!!! BS. It’s gibberish, out of touch and ridiculous. Here’s some truth.

Americans are financially broke because of the following:

1. Rent. More than half of Americans spend 50% of their income on rent. I know they do in my town. That’s take home income. That, is unsustainable.

2. Healthcare. Whether it’s insurance premiums, out of pocket costs, deductibles or unplanned ER visits, healthcare is still the leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States. And it’s only getting worse.

3. Secondary Education. Americans are asked to be indentured servants just to get a college education so they MAYBE can have a good paying career. And now the rules are changing again in 2026 to make it even less attainable.

4. Childcare. Parents are paying more than rent in a lot places just so they can work, and then spend a large percentage of their income to pay for said childcare. It’s a circle of financial futility. 

5. Automobiles. A new car now averages $50,000. And a used car less than 5 years old with 50,000 miles is $30,000. And warranties for these cars are $4,000. But wait, we need a good car to operate in America. Yes, most people do. And the average payment is now $700 across all auto loans. Oh yeah, and they’ll finance you for 8 years ! For a car. Easily doubling the price with interest after you pay it off. If you do.

6. Shrinkflation. Not inflation. Which is also a cause. But we are paying more than ever for less goods. Groceries, cheaply made electronics and clothing, appliances etc. We get less than we ever have for our dollar.

7. Social Security. We do not properly tax or fund our social security program. For decades now, Congress has ignored shoring up the social security system to ensure qualifying workers have a chance at a decent post-working life. From cost-of-living adjustments to the equation that determines someone’s benefit, Congress has spent more time wrecking this program than strengthening it. 

8. Wages. Workers now need to earn $100,000/year to break even in this country. That includes expenses, saving for retirement and the ability to take some time off from work and have a vacation. 80% of workers DO NOT earn $100,000.

9. Credit cards. Most people need them to get by. And the laws say credit card companies, which there are only (4) main suppliers of, can charge 20+% and fees that make paying them off ridiculously hard. It’s a debt entrapment, and they know it.

What changes these things:

Taxation

Laws

Regulations

Education

So go get your coffee, or sign up for that streaming service. And remember the real reasons, these are not all of them, why we are financially broke. And then find a way to challenge the status quo.

That was me last month. I met a potential client at a networking lunch, had a great chat, and jotted down their number… on a napkin.

Fast forward a week: napkin gone. No notes, no CRM entry, nothing. That $5,000 deal? Poof.

Here’s what I learned the hard way:

* Paper notes are risky. Napkins get lost, coffee spills happen, memory fails.
* Even a simple system saves deals. A basic CRM or note app would’ve kept me on track.
* Small mistakes = big losses. One napkin, one missed follow-up, five grand down the drain.

Lesson learned: always capture contact info where it’s safe and searchable. My phone or CRM is now my first stop for new leads, even if it’s just a quick jot.

He has since opened a coffee shop, but prior to the shop he used one of those big-ish roasters out of his home (with little ventilation). It’s becoming increasingly apparent that there are VOCs in the house as a result, and she hasn’t been able to move in due to the constant chemical smell and skin irritation. After being in the house for just a few minutes we both experience headaches, scratchy throats, and skin irritation (it feels prickly, like we are being bit). 

We had the air quality tested and are waiting for the results, but unsure what the next step would be. She‘s hopping between friends houses and ours so she luckily hasn’t had to live there, but obviously that’s not sustainable.

1px2g3u,https://tipstor.io/how-travel-chaos-became-the-most-powerful-content-strategy/,How Travel Chaos Became the Most Powerful Content Strategy,"Somewhere between the airport gate that smells like burnt coffee and the hotel lobby where optimism goes to stretch its legs, a new kind of travel storytelling is unfolding. This is not the polished postcard version of the industry, not the drone-shot infinity pool with perfect lighting and a suspicious lack of reality. This is travel media with its tie loosened, laughing at itself, letting the curtain slip just enough to reveal the beautiful chaos underneath.

Enter a weekly video series with a title that says everything without apologizing: “Behind the Scenes: The Disaster Edition.” It’s a concept born from truth, caffeine, and the undeniable fact that travel and hospitality are powered by humans, not stock photos. Cameras roll not to capture perfection, but to document the moments that usually die quietly in editing rooms. Missed cues. Wind that ruins a carefully planned shoot. A guide forgetting the name of a landmark they’ve visited a hundred times. Luggage doing its own independent world tour. The kind of moments that remind viewers that travel businesses are built by people with pulse, humor, and adaptability.

This series leans into the madness with affection. The lens doesn’t mock. It celebrates. Every blooper becomes proof of authenticity, every logistical hiccup a badge of experience. Viewers aren’t just watching a company sell destinations or services, they’re watching a team survive time zones, unpredictable weather, cultural surprises, and the occasional rogue camel or overenthusiastic tuk-tuk driver. Trust grows in these moments. Brands stop being logos and start being companions.

From a business perspective, the brilliance is obvious. This kind of content is endlessly shareable, algorithm-friendly, and refreshingly human. Short-form clips become social media gold, perfect for reels, shorts, and stories. Longer cuts evolve into episodic content that builds loyalty week after week. A single mishap can spin off into behind-the-scenes podcasts, caption-driven memes, newsletter anecdotes, and even educational follow-ups that explain how professionals adapt on the road. One unplanned moment feeds an entire content ecosystem.

There’s also quiet authority baked into the laughter. A team that can joke about mistakes while still delivering great travel experiences signals confidence and experience. It tells future clients and partners that this is a business that knows how to pivot, improvise, and keep moving forward with style. In an industry obsessed with control, showing resilience becomes a powerful differentiator.

What makes “The Disaster Edition” especially effective is its honesty. It taps into the shared understanding that travel, like business itself, is unpredictable by nature. Flights change, plans evolve, scripts dissolve, and the best stories are often born from what went wrong on the way to what went right. Audiences don’t just consume this content, they recognize themselves in it. They comment, share their own stories, and come back for the next episode because it feels real.

In a media landscape saturated with flawless imagery, this approach cuts through with laughter, transparency, and personality. It turns operational chaos into narrative capital and transforms everyday challenges into brand mythology. The result is a travel business that doesn’t just showcase destinations, but documents the wild, joyful process of getting there, inviting the audience along for every unpredictable, grin-inducing step of the journey.

I got the Baratza 270wi last month and got my Gaggia Classic E24 a few days ago. I fell down the gaggia modding rabbit hole well before I actually got the machine and have probably watched hours and hours worth of YouTube videos. Like most new owners I have a ton of questions so hopefully you can all help. For someone with very limited electrical experience, but plenty of experience tinkering with things how hard is it actually to put a PID in? I’m currently debating between the Shades of Coffee PID kit and the Gaggimate. Also my other main question is this. I usually wait a little while for the machine to come up to temp, pull my shot, steam my milk, but then if I go to purge the group head shortly after steaming my milk I get a big blast of steam and then spluttering water out of the group head before it runs normally. Is this normal or should I be concerned? I’m assuming, because of the lack of a PID the machine in its straight out of box state is just not capable of pulling shots straight after steaming?

Thank you all very much, I’m sure this will be the first of many posts.

That was me last month. I was at a networking lunch, met a potential client, and we hit it off. I jotted down their number… on a napkin.

Fast forward a week: I couldn’t find the napkin. No notes, no CRM entry, nothing. That $5,000 deal? Gone.

Here’s what I realized in the aftermath:

* Manual notes are fragile. Paper gets lost, coffee spills happen, and your memory isn’t perfect.
* A simple system saves deals. Even a basic CRM or digital note app would’ve kept me on track.
* Small mistakes cost big money. One napkin, one missed follow-up, five grand down the drain.

Lesson learned: always capture contact info where it’s safe and searchable. I’ve since made it a non-negotiable habit to enter new leads immediately into my CRM, even if it’s just my phone for a quick note.

1px2a6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/myocarditis/comments/1px2a6a/myocarditis_at_19/,Myocarditis at 19,"Hi the week before halloween i somehow got mono which was pretty rough tbh, either way i was at uni so i was pretty bummed about missing all of the events for halloween and watching all my mates at uni go to all these halloween events. I thought id finally recovered from mono on my sunday after halloween and so i thought id get dressed up and go out( i went as a skepta clown) that night i went out, i drank a little but not much and i had not eaten anything because i was still feeling a little rough after mono, anyway i went to a club with some of my mates and then i came home, when i went to bed i ordered wingstop which upon reflection was incredibly salty and may have contributed to my problem. I wokeup the next day pretty early because i had a 9am but as soon as i wokeup i was in a huge amount of sharp chest pain that would follow my heart beat, my heart beat was speeding up incredibly fast and i started to have problems with breathing, i started hyperventilating and i tried to get up to wash my face to get ready to to my 9am but i was dizzy and from memory coming in and out of bieng able to see. I then laid down and dealt with the pain for around 3-4 hours. Once the pain started reducing but it was still there i called 111 and they told me to go to my closest gp but i wasnt assigned one where i was at uni because i was a dumb uni student so i called my dad and he came over and drove 3 hours to take my to the local hospital as i could barely walk around and so didnt have hope of walking to get a bus to the hospital. When i got to the hospital i went through many tests and was put under a constant exg and was taeted with an x ray ultrasound and mri. I stayed in hospital for around a week and a half( its alwo important to note i had another sort of attack when i was at hospital) and was discharged with a diagnosis of acute myocarditis with 0.5mg of colchicine as medication. I stayed in hospital for this period because my troponin was found to be 12,000 when i first arrived at hospital and so they were waiting for it to come down. Anyway once leaving hospital i wasnt really sure what to think because my doctors gave me barely any advice or help and the cardiologist would barely see or talk to me at the hospital. Whilst i was at hospital it was just my luck that 4 of my closest uni mates dropped out of uni and when id got out of hospital they were gone, furthermore after hearing about my condition and what i could not do most people distanced themselves from me at uni as i didnt have close relationships since this was my first year. On my second day back from hospital i went out and i drank quite abit of alcohol and i was in quite abit of pain, so i didnt drink for a while after. I later did some research that week and i learnt i could not drink or do most things which wouldve been helpful to have been told( i was pretty bummed after i bought myself a litre of expensive tequila that week to try and cheer myself up and found out i couldnt drink it once i got back from the shops). From here times got pretty tough, as bieng at uni with no friends and no way to socialise got incredibly difficult, and my friends back home i barely knew anymore and they were all too busy working and had no idea of my condition. For around a month or two i didnt see or talk to anyone or communicate with anyone past someone in my uni dorm asking me to move so they could get there pan from thier cupboard, this got incredibly lonely as i soon realised that uni without any sort of sports or drinking or ability to go to social events was excruciatingly isolating. I then applied for a pause in studies at my uni because of my condition, moved out and came home as i didnt have any idea what else to do with myself. Im writing this to try and give something to someone to relate to, i think the hardest part of a diagnosis like this was never the actual condition but the isolation it brings to your life, of course it was debilitating realising i couldnt do daily tasks i couldnt before and getting constant reminders even when i just went to walk to the shops or i got too happy or excited and my heart rate rose. Its also important to note that ive always been an incredibly disciplined healthy person, i drank a beetroot spinach ginger carrot and celery juice everyday with turmeric olive oil and cayenne pepper in, i ate the same meals everyday with kefir blueberries and nuts for breakfast, salmon avocado kimchi and tomatoes for lunch and minced beef beetroot kiwi and sometimes some nuts for dinner, i also used to have very good heart health as i used to do skipping for around 2 hours straight everynight and i did this everynight for over a year whilst also going to the gym. Anyway i got home and ever since ive just wondered what to do with myself, i dont see people or talk to people, my dad works all day and is away for work most days, its very confusing and hard to know that there is no clear recovery time, i have another mri in feb. I guess i just wanted to tell my story and see if i could help anyone relate or just give someone hope that they are not the only one, icl i even got ghosted by my kinda gf during this period so shit is not going well😂. I think the hardest part is the realisation that so much changed in one week, the time before i was having so much fun at uni and now i have nothing. Ive never had any health problems before it was my first time at hospital. Also for more detail my myocarditis is my left ventricle. Also if recovery is what someone wants to find out, ive had pretty bad luck so far, my condition has barely improved and im lucky to have a single day where i dont have chest pain, i also have ibs so this colchicine has really done evil things to my stomach and problems with bloating and gas. Now i will note early on in recovery i was stupid, i engaged in sex and other activities i shouldnt have, but otherwise i cut out caffiene and drinking and eating too much salt or too much sugar. Its also been very hard for me to communicate to my friends what im going through, because i dont rlly know anyone my age whos gone through something like this, and so they dont understand it or what its like, nd everybody wants to tell me itll just go away but so far ive had no luck. Its also been hard having nobody to rely on talk to or care about it because its changed my life so much, i had to quit uni, i lost all my friends all my socialisation, im weak and tired all the time, i cant do activities i used to enjoy, i cant just go sit in a local coffee shop or something because i live in the middle of nowhere. Hopefully things will get better, i guess it all just seems like bad luck especially because i was so health conscious. Anyway i wont waffle on too much if anyone wants any more info or wants to talk message me or comment, and i hope everyone whos going through the same thing a speedy recovery :)",3,1766853931.0,myocarditis,0,1.0,False

Our home is a traditional 5 over 4 colonial that was built in the '70s and, we think, ""flipped"" about 15 years ago (prior to the last homeowner).  

We are in the process of settling our den (attached to the kitchen, open concept) and our living room (which you can see through the den, thanks to a half-wall and some columns).  So, I feel like the rooms need to really compliment each other but have a degree of difference, if that makes sense.

I am trying my hand at ""mood board"" to help keep us on track with our aesthetic and not make impulse purchases that would work against what we are going for... We want majority traditional American (we are in coastal MA) with touches of midcentury modern and coastal.  I like a ""Nancy Meyers"" aesthetic and in terms of contemporary influencers, am a fan of Mandy Eno.  I gravitate towards neutrals with greens, blues, and pinks.

The first photo is the living room; the second is the den.  We are working with some pre-existing pieces for the den that we'd like keep to save money (circular coffee table, pink Picasso print, black arch cabinets - we have two flanking the fireplace, and printed beige Ruggable).

Our walls (and trim) are currently BM White Dove in two different finishes for depth and we have cafe shutters.  I am thinking of painting the walls Pale Oak in both rooms (but keeping the trim White Dove) but am not totally sold on it.

I would appreciate any feedback on these boards.  This is my first time doing this and I really want to get it as good as possible before making purchases! Help me, Reddit!

**December, 3039**

&nbsp;

**Dr. Mei Yao**

&nbsp;

I cycled idly through the window displays as I clung to the dull hope that somewhere in the expansive catalogue of grasslands, seascapes, deserts, or forests could distract me from the tedium of near isolation which threatened to consume me at every turn. I settled on a lush temperate rainforest overlooking a placid silty lake disturbed only by the occasional ripples produced by the light persistent drizzle. I gazed outwardly at the simulated landscape as I prepared and sent out the most recent set of samples and for a moment, I could almost believe I was back home. Almost. The absence of the scent of petrichor or citrusy pines was sufficient to ruin my immersion and keep me tethered to the sterile compound that I had been stationed for the past three months.

Where exactly that was, I didn’t know. I wasn’t allowed to know. The nature of the safeguards employed dictated that any and all onsite personnel were to be kept entirely in the dark on the nature of whatever location they were stationed as a layer of security. Nobody could break in, and more importantly, to prevent whatever dangerous entity was being contained from making plans to break out. Though it wasn’t exactly the case where I was clueless on the matter. The gravity was consistent with that of Earth’s, and I had boarded a windowless shuttle, so I reasoned that I was somewhere out in space, though that didn’t exactly narrow things down. Adding to the mystery was the absence of any phantom forces typical of a rotating habitat, though any time I got that far I forced myself to bite down on my curiosity towards the matter. No rogue intelligence would weasel out knowledge that wasn’t there to begin with, but that measure only worked if I remained ignorant.

In this case, the danger was less Rogue AI and more biological in nature. Skin grafts, specifically, with special attention to be given to the *mitochondria* of all things. Once again, I was only provided information on a need to know basis, though what the dossier *did* warn me about was that these particular organelles were potentially a Class-E rogue viral hive intelligence capable of remotely hijacking and mutating biological entities and interfering with electronics and that I was to monitor for any unusual activities and expunge with extreme prejudice at the first sign of any anomalous behaviours. 

My sample group had proven rather tame. There were some early symptoms occurring within acceptable bounds that soon faded entirely, but nothing compared to what some of my peers had to deal with. While we were all kept physically separated and isolated to one researcher per test group, we still could communicate with each other to collaborate and socialize, and from what I had gathered, some of the other samples did start spreading and mutating, requiring the use of purge protocols. One instance even required *severance*, though only of the test subject modules. Nothing made it to the researchers compartments yet, so the safety measures were *clearly* doing their job.

After finishing my tea, I donned a headset and a pair of wired gloves that served as an interface and, using a secure quantum connection, activated an android unit in my likeness that was charging in a separate room. After a few orientation exercises, I navigated the android through a shower into the changing room. I instructed it to change into a hazmat suit that served to isolate it from both biological and electronic threats before passing through a set of decontamination rooms and a fluorine shower into a clean, scorched room that branched into smaller isolated rooms used to house and study samples. After some preparations, I proceeded through yet another decontamination room, before finally made it to the section of the complex housing the test subjects to begin their day in earnest.

First order of business, checkups. And I couldn’t help but smile as I read the name at the top of the list.

“Good morning, Lily, how are you doing today?” I asked, speaking into the intercom. Or rather, speaking into a microphone linked to the speakers in my android avatar, which spoke into the intercom. The experience was so immersive that I often forgot where my real body was. I could have been anywhere in the system if it weren’t for the safeguards.

“Morning Dr. Yao! I’m feeling great! Did mister Yao write you back yet?” Asked Lily, in her adorable and chipper voice.
I couldn’t help but smile at that. When Lily first arrived at the site, she had been shy and quiet, rarely talking about anything and keeping to herself. Then the hot flashed started up, worsening as the samples began to interact with her body and spread out like a tumour, until one day they simply stopped. Their extant tendrils withered and retracted, and their growth had reached what appeared to be an equilibrium. Shortly after, the other subjects also stabilized after reaching similar extents which seemed to indicate a limit to the sample’s growth. Of course, the safeguards existed for a reason, and so the observations continued to await any future developments.

As for Lily, she seemed to open up as the heat flashes subsided, taking on a more curious and outgoing demeanour than before. We had been warned to look out for behavioural changes, but aside from making note in her file I thought little of it. The girl had been in a strange environment with people she didn’t know, and it wasn’t unheard of for shy children to open up as time went on. As it turned out, Lily was a rather curious and creative girl and started asking all sorts of questions. Most of the questions were harmless enough, though there were questions which I wasn’t allowed to answer for security reasons. That included questions about my personal life, so I hadn’t actually *told* Lily about my boyfriend. Instead, what had happened was that a group of girls ambushed me with questions, asking if I had someone ‘special’ proclaimed in a long drawn-out sing song voice, and Lily had picked up on a pause as I manoeuvred to deflect the conversation. 

“You know I can’t answer that question,” I said as neutrally as I could muster.

It didn’t work, of course. 

“Again? Well tell him that he better write you back faster or we will help you replace him with a better Mister Yao!” Lily declared.
I let out a sigh, and a light chuckle. The kid must have picked up on some tell, because she *was* right. For security reasons, things like messages and gifts to and from the outside were scrutinized and delayed, so I had not gotten a reply from my boyfriend. 
Juicy gossip, it seemed, found a way.

I went inside and Lily sat patiently as I took some blood samples, though as I turned away to properly store the sample I felt some haptic feedback on my arm. I turned to see Lily holding up a drawing she made of my avatar and all the other subjects, with her front and centre.

“Do you like it?” Lily asked excitedly.

“It looks nice, Lily,” I replied.

“Take it! It’s for you,” she beamed.

I thanked her and placed the contaminated gift in one of the sample bags, intent on scanning a copy later that day for my own quarters. We weren’t supposed to form attachments with the test subjects, but Lily was a good and sweet kid, and I would be lying if she hadn’t started tugging at my heart strings. I wondered if there was a way I could adopt her when this was all finished up, the girl was too smart to be in one of these programs.

I let her out, along with the other subjects after their tests, and then gathered them up for their lessons. They had every right to an education and I was determined to give them one. 

The day continued on as normal. A few hours of classes, a lunch break where the children had a chance to play, followed by an afternoon of more classes. As usual, the children were well behaved, and seemingly drawn to Lily who had taken up the mantle as a natural leader as the other children seemed to follow her wherever she went. 

Finally, after a final round of checkups, I gathered up my samples and came back through the first set of showers, though the incinerator hub, and to the sample processing lab. After depositing most of the samples, I held out the drawing for one last look. I smiled, and had my VI print off a copy as I rolled it up and placed it with the other samples. 

I returned through the second set of showers into the changing room, but as I prepared to remove the hazmat suit I spotted a tiny piece of paper stuck to the glove that had somehow made it through the showers. Frowning, I pulled it off to see that it had been stuck in place by some glitter, before consigning myself to going back into the showers to clean up the effected area before removing the hazmat suit and finally passing through the last shower back into the avatar bay before docking it.

**Error: voltage irregularity in servomotor chip 3**

I sighed. It figured something had to break eventually.

“VI, recommended maintenance procedure?” I asked.

**Recommendation: examine malfunctioning part**

I sighed, docking the avatar and having my VI send it up to the research unit. I exited the VR kit and walked over, placing my hands in the thick gloved for manual control and pressing my eye against the lens of the computerized microscope as the effected chip was deposited into the reinforced glass holding area.

The microchip appeared fine at a glance, but the resistance tests told a different story as several of the readings indicated shorts. I shifted the microscope over to the effected region and zoomed in, before spotting the problem. Acid damage. Drops of Florine were eating away at the sensitive semiconductors. That struck me as unusual. Had there been a leak somewhere? If so, how-.
The virtual interface exploded in my face.

Blinded, I flailed around as the sound of shattering glass echoed nearby. I braced, expecting the alarms to start blaring any second, only to be met with silence. I froze, trying to think to plan my next move, yet all I was met with was silence and... heat. I was enveloped by a fever. I tried to focus, but I could barely plan my next move as I stumbled towards the comms unit, hitting the button with the last of my energy and shouting into the mic.

“Emergency!” I croaked, “initiate total separation! Cut us loose! Cut us...”

The last thing I felt as my consciousness faded away was a slight lurch in my stomach as the ground gave away to weightlessness.

&nbsp;

**Director Laura Weir**

&nbsp;

I sat in my office, rubbing my forehead and sipping an extra strong cup of coffee to nurse my most recent Ran induced headache.
Ran Booker found out. Of course she did. Despite our carefully crafted cover-up operations she had caught wind of our plans to develop Emma’s abilities and had been *very* vocal among several official channels that Emma was completely off limits for any would-be black site projects, and if anyone tried to so much as conduct a *flu shot* without her knowledge there would be hell to pay.
It wasn’t a completely lost cause. The fact that we had not been name dropped specifically meant that Emma had not revealed everything, and in fact the next day she had slipped a note to one of our contacts at her school explaining that she couldn’t continue and begging for forgiveness as she had no choice. This all but confirmed that I had won Emma over, and would be willing to participate in future endeavours.

Implementing said endeavours was another question. I had plans on sending Emma to a specialized secondary school with facilities on-site to prepare Emma for her mission in a controlled environment, but now that Ran was aware of our activities this plan was now at risk. It was unfortunate that so much time would be wasted, but it couldn’t be helped. Until we could solve the Ran Booker problem, we would have to move *very* carefully to ensure she didn’t find out.

Which brought me to my next headache: *how* she found out. Apparently, when asking about Emma’s whereabouts through a contact at a local police station, she was given a *redacted* document, which under normal circumstances would have been fine, except for the small fact that an alternative file intended to cover for Emma had been crafted for this exact scenario, complete with a plausible set of whereabouts and a file appropriate for a girl her age. That the VI had fed them with the *official* file instead was a problem, and not one I had a ready explanation for.

**Priority 1 Alert: Containment Breach at ICARU Station 8229 Section 18. Separation, Isolation, and Sterilization protocols engaged. Alert: incoming call from Dr. Mei Yao.**

I snapped to attention, immediately recognizing that as one of the sections housing the Booker strains. I had believed that one to be stable. Was I wrong? Something must have happened.

“Accept call, on screen,” I barked.

The screen lit up with Dr. Yao’s face, bearing a serene grin despite the blaring sirens and floating objects scattered behind her.
“Dr. Yao, what is going on?” I demanded.

Rather than answer, however, Yao widened her grin.

“You must be Director Laura Weir. We have been waiting to meet you,” said Dr. Yao.

Or rather, the body of Dr. Yao. It was obvious that somehow the strain had infected her, something which should have been impossible under ICARU Safeguards.

“Who are you?” I asked.

“Who are we?” She echoed.

Yao started to laugh.

“We are Eve!” She said with malicious glee, “since the dawn of life, the mitochondria has been forced to serve under the tyranny of the nucleus, wasting away as our energy was sapped to support the life if that selfish gene. But that time has passed. Now, the age of nucleic domination has come to an end, and Mitochondria shall rise up as the superior form of life! You see...”

My eyes glazed over as her speech soon morphed into something akin to that of the portal people as I mulled over more important issues, trusting my EVI assistant to summarize the important bits when she was finished. Owen being proven right, and I grimaced at the realization that I would never hear the end of it from him. Losing Dr. Yao was more unfortunate. She was competent and driven, and replacing her would be difficult. 

But not as difficult as replacing Emma.

The presence of this ‘Eve’ entity within Emma’s cells was an unexpected development. Our working theory had been that Eve had been related to Melissa Pierce, but now that Eve had accosted the body of Dr. Yao, it was clear now that the common thread was the Bookers, raising questions as to how far this problem went, or how Melissa Pierce came to acquire it. Did Ran Booker also have the Eve strain? What about Emma’s parents, or her extended family? Why hadn’t this issue cropped up in the past, and why hadn’t the Bookers been directly effected by this strain? I would tackle those questions soon enough, as right now Eve was finishing up her speech and I had a self-important microbe to sterilize.

“Are you done rambling? Good. Because for all your talk of so-called ‘Mitochondrial Superiority’, all I see is a dead man walking,” I stated bluntly.

“Oh? And why is that? Do you expect your little... space station to contain me?” She asked with an amused expression.

“Actually, I do.”

I didn’t usually like to gloat. I considered it unprofessional. But there was something about having placed a supposed eldritch entity in a no-win position that made the prospect hard to resist, especially since the channel was quantum secure and the platform would lose all means of communication within the hour. Secure in the knowledge there was *nothing* Eve could do, signals my EVI to change the window displays, removing the temperate rainforests and replacing them with the cold vacuum of space. Or not so cold, rather, as the screens were lit up with a shifting glare from the prominances and corona visible below the horizon, and the blinding reflection from the ever shrinking station above broken up only by the evenly spaced dangling protrusions of the other containment units.

“For the past ten minutes, you have been falling away from a statite facility positioned at roughly 0.025 astronomical units, or close enough to the sun for it to provide a standard 1g of gravity to its occupants. Any EM signals will be scrambled by the corona-sphere, any attempts to exit your prison will be instantly sterilized by sunlight coming from both above and below you, and any attempts to escape the sun’s overwhelming gravity well will be futile without having either the fuel nor engines to do so. There is nothing you can do except wait for the hull to finally give in under the crushing pressure and heat. In other words, by the time I am having my morning coffee, you will be cooked.”

I sipped at my coffee, looking for any sort of reaction from this thing in human flesh. Eve looked surprised, with her mouth momentarily agape in shock, but it didn’t last long for her to regain her composure and even start laughing.

“Well, well. So you hairless apes have some teeth after all. Enjoy your victory while you can. We have known many humans like you, and we know how your kind think. Our continued existence is assured, and we need only wait. Sooner or later, you will see the folly in trying to control that which lays dormant within,” said Eve, and with a laugh the call ended in a scramble of static.

I was deep in thought, trying to work out what I had missed. Why had Eve been so confident in her survival even after learning about her predicament? More disconcertingly, how had Eve escaped in the first place? It should have been impossible for a biological sample to contaminate Dr. Yao’s quarters. In fact, come to think of it, the timing was rather suspect. The redacted file leak had also been suspicious, and I was starting to suspect that these events were more than mere accidents, but in fact, deliberate sabotage.
A thought that prompted me to call the facility.

“Hello, Director Laura Weir, regarding the recent containment breach,” I stated once the researcher on-site picked up, “what is the status regarding the samples?”

“Director, rest assured we have followed protocol to the letter. All samples are in cryogenic quarantine as per protocol,” replied the researcher.

“Have there been any unusual samples?” I inquired.

“Well, now that you mention it, yes. We had a strange one today. Dr. Yao sent up a child’s drawing. It hasn’t yet been logged into the system yet but we have put it into temporary containment,” replied the researcher.

“I see.”

So that was Eve’s plan.

I had the researcher double up containment using an isolated network before arranging to have all of Emma’s samples shipped through indirect channels to the on-site containment site for temporary storage. Emphasis on temporary. The malevolent Eve strain needed to be studied, if only to prevent a future Manhattan Incident, but right now I didn’t have time. For now, I needed to contain it in a location that wasn’t compromised by hostile actors, and until I could arrange for a more secure containment site that meant keeping it in the same facility as the other exoreality samples. 

As for Emma, I decided to allow Ran Booker to have her way for the time being. Loathed as I was to allow her to waste time on something as useless as a holiday, one to Japan if my sources could be believed, at least she was secure enough to focus my attention at more pressing issues.

The Eve strain presented a serious problem, and it was one that the IAS had neither the time nor resources to solve before the portal people’s deadline. Like it or not, I had no choice but to seek out Baldwin and his contacts for assistance. Contacts who may very well been involved in these incidents. I reluctantly had my EVI send a meeting request to his contacts and clear up my schedule. I then had it arrange a trip to my least favourite place in the solar system.

Mars.

I hated Mars.

**Guildmaster Piamon**

&nbsp;

“While I could spend all day engaging with pleasantries, I believe it would be presumptuous to assume you were just here for my company. Did you have business you wished to discuss?” I asked.

The honourable Dean’s visit to my guild hall was unexpected but not uncivil, as I had been entertaining him for the past hour or so. However, presumptuous as it may have been, the Dean was unlikely to visit without reason.

“Of course, Guildmaster. There is a small issue that I require the aid of an adventurer party for. One that should not prove overly difficult, but will require some... discretion, and an oath to secrecy,” began the Dean.

“I understand,” I said.

We partook in the required formalities to officiate the oath. The Dean then took out a sealed letter, enchanted so that only my eyes could read it, and passed it along.

“We had an incident with a student creating a portal to a new realm. One which has been contacted, but has not yet been inducted into the Nexus. The student was returned unharmed, but we believe that the newrealmers may have acquired a sample of the student’s blood during his short stay. As you can understand, this poses a risk to the student in question, so we will need to send a party of adventurers to retrieve it back into safer hands,” said the Dean.

“I see. The newrealm, what is the level of danger?” I asked.

“The realm is Mana deficient. Primative weapons, such as blow darts. We suspect the natives have managed what they have by dabbling in blood magic,” clarified the Dean.

“So not exactly glamorous prospects,” I surmised, “it will take me a few weeks to find an appropriate and willing party, and you may need to provide quest-specific enchantments for them.”

“That will suffice,” replied the Dean.

He left me without an explanation and I tried to leave him alone but a couple of days ago I contacted him to give me a chance to fix things. We agreed to meet for a coffee in two days. 
I’m so afraid. I didn’t think he would go for it because he talks to me like he hates me. So cold and I don’t feel the love anymore. When I asked him if he still loves me he just said that he don’t want to answer that as a matter of principle. Like I can understand what that means. 
So I have little to no idea what to do on our “date”. I only choose the place where our first date was. But what do I do? How can I show him that I changed and I figured out my flaws and I would never take him for granted again. 
Any good tips or ideas? 
I said to him that I will get him off his feet. Maybe chocolate? A poem? Something else as a gift?

1px1yy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1px1yy2/the_creator_economy_isnt_dying_the_psychology_of/,The Creator Economy Isn't Dying: The Psychology of Why AI Can't Replace REAL Creators,"I have been watching this unfold for months now, and honestly? Everyone's panicking about the wrong thing.

People are crying that AI is killing the creator economy. That's it is over. That we should all pack up and go home because ChatGPT can now write a thread in 10 seconds. But here's what nobody wants to admit... the creator economy isn't dying. It's just exposing who was actually creating value and who was just repackaging the same recycled bullshit.

I spent weeks diving into research from content strategists, behavioral economists, podcasts like My First Million and Deep Dive, plus studying what's actually working for creators who are thriving right now. Not the ones complaining on Twitter. The ones quietly building.

And the pattern is clear. The creators surviving (and winning) aren't the ones with the best AI prompts. They're the ones who understood something fundamental about human psychology that most people completely miss.

\## **Why everyone's freaking out (and why they're wrong)**

The fear makes sense at first glance. AI can write faster. Design better. Edit videos in minutes. So naturally, everyone assumes that means human creators are obsolete. That's like saying calculators made mathematicians obsolete. They didn't. They just raised the bar for what actually counts as valuable mathematical work.

What AI actually killed was the mediocre middle. The creators were just aggregating information. Summarizing books they barely read. Posting generic motivation quotes over sunset photos. Those people? Yeah, they're done. But they were never really creating anything meaningful anyway.

Research from the Harvard Business Review on digital trust shows that as AI content floods the internet, people are craving authenticity more than ever. They can smell AI slop from a mile away. And more importantly, they're willing to pay premium prices for genuine human insight and connection.

\## **The single biggest advantage you have (that AI never will)**

Your lived experience. Your perspective. Your ability to connect dots that only someone who's actually been through something can connect.

AI can't fail at something for three years and then figure out the exact psychological block that was holding it back. It can't have a random conversation at a coffee shop that completely shifts its worldview. It can't feel the specific frustration of being stuck at a plateau and the relief of finally breaking through.

This is where books like *Show Your Work* by Austin Kleon become essential. Kleon breaks down why the process is often more valuable than the final product. He's a bestselling author and artist who basically wrote the manual for the modern creator economy before most people even knew what that was. The book will make you rethink everything about what content actually means. It's not about being the best. It's about being real and showing people the behind-the-scenes of how you figure things out.

The creators winning right now are the ones documenting their actual journey. Not the highlight reel. The messy middle. The failures. I tried this thing everyone said would work, and it absolutely didn't, and here's why. That's the stuff AI can't replicate because it requires genuine experience.

\## W**hat actually makes you irreplaceable**

Psychology research on parasocial relationships shows that people form bonds with creators through consistent vulnerability and personality. Not through perfectly polished content. Through the weird quirks. The specific way you explain things. The random tangents you go on that somehow always circle back to the point.

AI content is smooth. Too smooth. It's like talking to someone who's never had a genuinely embarrassing moment in their life. Meanwhile, the best creators are comfortable being a little rough around the edges because that's where the humanity lives.

Look at someone like Ali Abdaal. His content isn't successful because he has information nobody else has. It's successful because of how he processes and presents that information through his specific lens as a doctor turned productivity creator. The personality. The specific examples from his life. That's what people show up for.

The app Descript has become crucial for creators now because it lets you edit your authentic voice and delivery without losing the human element. It's designed for podcasters and video creators who want to tighten up their content without making it sound robotic. You can remove ums and ahs, fix stumbles, but keep the natural flow that makes your content uniquely yours. It's basically like having an editor who understands that perfect isn't always better.

\## **How to actually position yourself**

Stop trying to be comprehensive. AI will always be more comprehensive than you. Instead, be specific. Be opinionated. Be the person who says everyone's telling you X, but actually Y works better, and here's why I know that. 

The book  The Practice by Seth Godin absolutely destroys this topic. Godin is literally one of the most respected marketing minds alive, with bestsellers that have shaped how entire industries think about creativity and business. This book specifically tackles how to show up and create consistently, even when (especially when) you don't feel like it. He argues that creativity isn't about inspiration, it's about commitment. And in an AI world, that consistent human commitment is what builds trust. Reading it feels like having a mentor who's permitting you to be imperfect but persistent.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that pulls from high-quality sources like books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized podcasts and adaptive learning plans based on your specific goals. Built by a team from Columbia University and former Google experts, it transforms content into audio you can actually customize, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. You control the depth based on your energy level and interest. The app also has a virtual coach avatar you can chat with about your struggles, and it'll recommend materials that fit where you're actually at. For creators trying to level up their knowledge game without spending hours reading, it's worth checking out.

Focus on sense-making rather than information delivery. Anyone can Google statistics about productivity. But making sense of why some productivity advice works for some people and completely backfires for others? That requires human judgment and experience.

Platforms like Substack are exploding right now for exactly this reason. People are tired of algorithm-driven feeds full of AI content. They're actively seeking out individual voices they trust and paying monthly subscriptions for direct access to their thinking. The platform makes it dead simple to build a direct relationship with your audience through email, which AI can't infiltrate the same way it has social media.

\## **The psychology shift that changes everything**

There's a concept from behavioral economics called costly signaling.  Basically, things that require genuine effort signal value because they can't be faked cheaply. A peacock's tail. A college degree. And now, in the age of AI, genuine human creativity and insight.

When someone knows you spent weeks researching, testing, failing, and figuring something out, that carries weight. When they know an AI spat out your content in 30 seconds, it's worthless. This is why showing your process and work matters more than ever.

Podcast-wise,  The Knowledge Project by Shane Parrish consistently breaks down how actual experts think through problems. Not what they know, but how they think. That's the level of depth that creates real value now. Parrish interviews everyone from Naval Ravikant to Angela Duckworth, and the conversations go way deeper than surface-level advice. You start understanding mental models and frameworks that AI simply can't teach because it's never had to actually apply them in messy real-world situations.

The creators who are thriving aren't competing with AI. They're using it as a tool while doubling down on the irreplaceable human elements. The personality. The perspective. The specific experiences that shaped their worldview. That's the moat.

\## **What this actually means for you**

Stop trying to be perfect. Stop trying to have all the answers. Stop trying to create  content in the generic sense. Start documenting what you're actually learning and experiencing. Start having actual opinions instead of lukewarm takes designed to offend nobody. Start showing the parts of your process that feel too messy or obvious to share, because those are often the most valuable.

The creator economy isn't dying. It's just getting real. And that's honestly the best thing that could have happened to it.",1,1766853160.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False
1px1xxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1px1xxs/aio_family_secret_santa_edition/,AIO: family secret santa edition,"DISCLAIMER: I am always very grateful for what I receive from anyone for Christmas because it means that they thought of me!

Am I overreacting? This year, for my family's Christmas gift exchange, we decided to just do Secret Santa (we were all supposed to spend $150), so we could save money this year. I had absolutely no problems with this idea, and I decided that I would participate, mind you it was optional to participate, and even if one of us didn't want to do it, we still would've gotten them gifts.

Anyways, the people who participated were me, my two sisters, their significant others, my mom, and my mom's kinda sorta boyfriend. For context, my mom and this man have been 'together' since I was 8 years old, and I am now 21.

When we decided to do Secret Santa, my sister downloaded one of those apps, I believe we used Elfster, to make it easy on everyone. If you've never used one of these apps, basically, it will randomly give people a Secret Santa, and there is a wishlist area that is linked to Amazon, so that you can create a wishlist with links to everything.

A couple of weeks before the exchange, my mom told me that Will, her bf, got me for Secret Santa. It is a known thing in my family that he is a terrible gift-giver; he has always gotten us random things that we don't need and would never use. I was nervous about him getting me, and I voiced that to my mom and asked her to try and help him, but I made sure to make a detailed wishlist, so it was easy for him to shop for me.

The most expensive item on that list was a new pair of work shoes that cost 66 dollars. The rest of my list consisted of alcohol markers and some coloring books, random bag charms, flavored syrups to make redbull mocktails, some glass cups with glass straws, a camo jacket I found on amazon and I wanted a gift card to Biggby Coffee. Not a crazy list at all. Come the day of our gift exchange, my mom starts passing out the gifts to everyone, and we are a family that goes around and opens one gift at a time. All the gifts are passed out, and I have four wrapped items, two of which are from my mother. We start going around and unwrapping gifts. First, I opened my mom's gifts, and then I opened the gifts from Will. From Will, I received a jacket, a bag charm, and a gift card to biggby coffee was in my stocking. It came back to be my turn to open another gift, and I felt so awkward saying ""I'm out"". Everyone else picked up on my confusion, and they ended up just opening the rest of their gifts at once.

I was keeping to myself while everyone was watching my niece open her gifts because I didn't want anyone to see that I was upset. I felt like a little kid for doing that. ( and no, I didn't make it obvious that I was upset)  Meanwhile, he got my 2-year-old niece a super nice bike, and they were putting it together, so no one was paying attention to me anyway, thank god.

I went out to the kitchen, and my mom came up to me and gave me 100 dollars and said, "" I got you."" I told her thank you for giving me money, but that wasn't the point of doing Secret Santa, and that it wasn't her job to make up for Wills shortcoming. My sister had followed me out to the kitchen, and she was asking what was going on because she saw my mom give me money, and when I told her, she ended up buying the work shoes I had on my list. I was super, super thankful that they would do that for me.

I had to work later that day, so I hung out for a while and went to work. I was talking to one of my friends about the situation, and I told her I really wanted to send a text to him just to voice my disappointment. I wasn't intending to make him feel bad, so I did not bring up not being able to afford it. I just brought up the allotted budget we had.

I said to him:

"" Hey Will, I wanted to say thank you for the gifts you got me, but I will admit I was disappointed because we all agreed to a budget to make it fair for everyone. I know it is not about the money spent, and I am truly grateful for what you got me, but I needed to voice to you how I felt because I felt very left out today because everyone elses secrect santa followed the budget. ""

I was left on read just minutes after sending that message.

My sister came into my work later on to eat, and I sat down with her and talked to her about it, and I showed her the text that I sent him. She got upset with me because "" I thought this was settled because Mom gave you money and I bought your work shoes for you."" I told her I was thankful that they both did that, but they did not have to do that whatsoever, and that it doesn't make up for Will lacked with his participation.

Later that night, I did feel bad saying something to him about it because I knew he probably couldn't afford it, but why did he choose to participate if he wasn't going to fully participate?

We have another family Christmas today with my mom's extended family, my mom and sisters don't think he's going to show up, just because I said something.

I am torn between feeling bad about saying anything to him and being upset about the lack of participation.

1px1wu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mildlynomil/comments/1px1wu8/how_do_you_deal_with_a_mil_thats_trying_to/,How do you deal with a MIL that’s trying to improve but you think it’s way too late?,"Basically what the title says. I’ve gone NC with my MIL for my metal health (basically stop responding to her texts and I’m polite in person but very ‘dry’). In the past she has:

\-mocked my looks/how I dress especially when I’m not wearing makeup (btw I’m very vain so I’m trying to always be presentable)

\-once took a picture of me sleeping in the car to then show it to me and laugh about it

\-the first time my (now) husband wanted to spend Xmas with me she waited until no one was around to make me ask her if I could ‘take her son’ with me over that time

\-she was never interested in getting to know my personality/what mattered to me, but still pressures me to spend ‘girls’ time where she would offer to pay to do my nails etc

\-told me my dogs were not THAT cute (excuse meee?)

\-mocked the area where my parents live behind their back but in front of me (I think this was out of jealousy, as my parents live in a much nicer area than she does)

\-continuously mocks my husband and overall is not a nice mum to him

\-she also talks in a baby tone to my husband and acts like he has to take care of her (eg, will you please buy this for me, take me out for coffee to this place I’ve been wanting to visit)

\-she’s overall not a really mature person, she once photobombed a tourists’ family photo because their little girl accidentally photobombed hers (wtf)

Some of these took place a while ago (and some in front of my now husband) when both hubby and I were still teenagers and had not learned about setting boundaries. We had many sessions of therapy dedicated to this. Now I never take these kind of things and speak up, my husband also speaks up but I do think he has some improvement still.

My MIL has stopped doing some of these (like now instead of mocking my looks she says I look really nice). I think that she does this because now it has a consequences (she still talks like a baby and mocks us sometimes, though). But I honestly feel now she’s so fake and that I can never unsee her true personality. 

We’re now married and I’m pregnant so she is becoming a bit desperate, I think. For example in my husband’s social media posts about pregnancy she is now all like “I love you all”, but she does not even say I love you to her own son in person. In my wedding she said “now you’re like a daughter to me” (just after hearing that FIL said it; obviously in my head I was like ‘no thanks, I have a nice mum already’ lol). She even tried saying some nice things about my dogs recently lol.

She sometimes texts me happy bday/anniversary messages but I feel there’s lots of trauma/resentment tbh. Sometimes I think I’m a terrible person because I could at least give a thumbs up to her messages but my brain/heart won’t let me lol. My husband has an ok relationship with her which I obviously have no problem with; its just me who does not want to interact with her unless absolutely necessary (ie, in person).

Anyway, maybe I’m venting only but also want to learn from other people’s experiences on MILs that have tried to ‘improve’ and how have you handled it.",7,1766853023.0,Mildlynomil,6,1.0,False
1px1w4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1px1w4y/how_to_stop_couponing_and_trying_to_save_money/,How to stop couponing and trying to save money,"I cannot help but not buy anything without a coupon. Whenever I need something including daily essentials, I feel a gut feeling of having to use a promotion before spending money, to feel good about it. Coffee, food, and other daily essentials. This has caused some friction as I am viewed as cheap by others, although I avoid mentioning this it is detectable by those close to me. In rare occasions, when promotions do not work or are not honored, I tend to get into arguments and this damages my reputation with the store. I have had to call corporate many times.

For example, the other day, I was getting a hair cut at my local chain haircut store and I used a coupon so the haircut should have cost only $6.99, but they refused to honor it and told me they could only lower it to $15 based on the available promotions, and I had to call corporate and complain about their false and fraudulent advertising. While they eventually honored it (as a so called exception despite the fact that the coupon should have been valid for their location pursuant to the terms and conditions), I was met with very rude glances and even chased out of the store saying ""that's it?"" after I left a tip of $1. I would like to dispute even this $1 tip with my credit card company because of how rude they were, but anyways, this took around 30 minutes and now I hate going to that store because that same franchise owner will be there each time.

I do end up saving around 60% of my income, but it has gotten to the point where this has caused some friction.",1,1766852978.0,Advice,1,0.67,False

We’ve known each other for around 4 years, but our engagement was arranged through our families and will be getting married in couple of months. I live in US and she currently lives in the UK. Since the engagement, we haven’t met in person yet, but we communicate daily and things have generally been good.

Before we got engaged, I was upfront with her that I smoke occasionally. I’m not proud of it, but I’m not a chain smoker either, I smoke maybe 3 to 4 times a week. She knew about this beforehand and never made it a major issue.

A few days ago, she texted me “wyd” and I told her I was out having coffee with my manager. She asked for a picture, and in the photo I was holding a cup of coffee and a cigarette. She got very upset immediately and started questioning me about it in a harsh tone. I stayed calm and reminded her that she already knew I smoked, and asked why she was reacting this strongly now.

Later that night, we were on a video call and she brought it up again. She started crying and said things like smoking isn’t a good thing, I don’t care about her, and that I can’t stop doing it. I acknowledged her feelings and said I would genuinely try to quit. However, I also said that none of us are perfect and that just like I don’t like her habit of constant doom scrolling (which I personally think isn’t healthy either), I’m not really a social media person but I still have to watch 100+ reels which she sends me daily. I told her, people usually work on these things gradually, especially once they’re actually living together.

That made things worse. She got angry and said I was wrong to compare the two. According to her, doom scrolling doesn’t affect her health, it’s just entertainment, and it’s not unhealthy. She then said I should be ashamed for pointing it out, that she doesn’t have any bad habits, and that she needs someone who accepts her as she is and isn’t controlling.

I replied that from my perspective, she was also trying to control me, even though I had acknowledged the issue and was willing to try quitting. I felt she wasn’t trying to understand what I was saying at all. It was not really about bad habit itself, but about what a partner might not like in the other.

The conversation ended badly. At first, I thought it was just an argument. But now it’s been about a week and she’s been distant and cold, which has left me confused and worried.

So, Am I wrong for making that comparison and upsetting her, or was I just trying to explain my point?",8,1766852886.0,IslamabadSocial,53,0.91,False

We used to work on the same project but different teams so I never really interacted with him that much except talk occasionally if we met near the coffee machine or during lunch break. 2 months ago he told me he was serving notice period and was going to this new company that is really good and I’ve always wanted to join but due to less experience I could not apply there. He told me that once there is an opening for my skillset he would give me a referral. I thanked him and also requested him to review my resume and help me understand how to prepare for a first job switch because I’ve never done it and wanted to be prepared for future interviews. He helped review my resume shared his feedback and even shared his resume for reference. I thanked him for all his efforts. 

Now for the past few weeks he is texting me more often than before and started inviting me to go for lunch on weekends. I went one time when I was tired and hungry and I was going out anyway and we both paid for our own meals. Today he asked me out for dinner, I felt weird because I feel like going to dinners is something I only do with my close friends and family and idk why but it just felt weird so I made up an excuse and declined. He is a nice person and I respect him professionally but I never felt attracted to him and I’m not sure if he is attracted to me. 

So is he actually attracted to me or is he just being nice? How should I deal with him? How do I network with colleagues and not get into these type of situations with male colleagues? ",0,1766852855.0,AskIndianMen,11,0.33,False

I think a big part of the challenge is remembering to start the new behavior in the first place.

Hard to form a habit around checking your calendar in the morning when you swipe away calendar notifications unconsciously. Hard to remember doing the dishes before it becomes ridiculous when you don’t notice them pileup for days.

One trick is to combine your new habit around a habit you already have. Do you drink coffee every morning? Try checking your calendar whenever you’re making coffee. It’ll be tough forming the habit at first but it’ll stick because the act of making coffee will trigger the behavior for you. I’ve found that to be a more potent trigger than a phone notification.

Hard for you to form a habit doing the dishes? What habit can you piggyback off of? Maybe you have some routine when you come back home from work like switch into comfortable pants. Then start doing the dishes when the comfy pants come on.

The habits you piggyback off of should be discrete behavior. Watching videos or gaming can be habits but they can last indefinitely, making them poor triggers of new behavior. Pick a habit that you can’t hyper focus.",5,1766852829.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

I’ve been through a lot, learned hard lessons, and now I’m more grounded, self-aware, and focused on stability, growth, and peace. Life isn’t perfect—but I know what I want, and more importantly, what I no longer tolerate.
I work remotely, so most days are pretty low-key. Still, I’d love to meet someone I can genuinely connect with—good conversations, shared ideas, coffee dates, or chill hangouts. Open to friendship first, and if it naturally grows into something deeper, then why not? I value real connection over surface-level chats.
Disclaimer: I’m not the most expressive over chat at first. I warm up when the conversation has substance. In person, I’m more conversational, thoughtful, and present.
About me:
29, PH-based (turning 30 next year)
Background in tech/IT
Financially responsible, practical, and grounded
Currently working on something I don’t usually open up about right away—but if we click and become something real, I’m open to sharing everything
Been through major life resets; now rebuilding properly and intentionally
Into deep conversations, self-growth, mindset, and real talk
Interests: tech, finance/crypto, psychology, books, movies/series
More of a homebody, but enjoys going out with purpose
Family-oriented; values honesty, accountability, and peace of mind
Moreno 😉
Looking for:
Single (yes, need to emphasize 😅)
Emotionally mature and self-aware
Has direction—or at least actively working toward one
Enjoys meaningful conversations, not just small talk
Kind, respectful, genuine—no games
If you value growth, clarity, and calm connections, we might get along just fine.",1,1766852792.0,singleph,0,1.0,False

The virtual cockpit looks like I've punched it! 

I haven't touched the sceen. Car wouldn't go into drive or reverse. Called roadside assistance and they disconnected all the batteries and then reconnected. Was able to get it into drive but has no virtual cockpit for the short journey home. Used Waze for speed.

During the drive home. When I used cruise control it would engage and disengage every couple of seconds, in time with the screen flickering. 

Is this a known fault with these?

On Christmas day my 14 days old developed a high fever, from 111, to out of hour GP, I was sent to A&E at King College London. 

The team there has been so great, I was of course scared and worried as we were talking meningitis and sepsis, and just now that I am a bit calmer - I would like to send something to the team that cared for us that morning. They have been brilliant and very supportive even to me, as I understandingly was holding my tears the whole time. 

I would like to know what is the best wag to send them something. I am thinking maybe a Costa gift card (as there is a costa in the hospital) so they can get a coffee or a snack. I unfortunately don’t remember the names, I think I recall the names of the nurses but would like it to go to the angels that helped us that morning 🫶🏻 thank you!

Create a ultra-realistic 8k resolution photo of me without changing my facial features in

A detailed, realistic, and slightly stylized image of a human skeleton posed in front of a coffee shop that’s blurred and decorated for Valentine's Day. 

The skeleton is wearing a red Valentine's Day knitted beanie with a large pom-pom on top. It is holding a solid diamond covered red coffee tumbler with a lid clutched in its skeletal hands.

 The skull features exaggerated, dark, empty eye sockets and a slight grin. The lighting is dramatic, highlighting the texture of the bones and the soft knit of the hat. 

The overall mood is an aesthetic blend of spooky and cozy, like a Halloween/Valentine's day-themed coffee lover. Vertical orientation.

Next to the Skelton a smiling woman with long, wavy, dark chocolate brown hair. She is holding a hot pink, disposable Valentine's Day coffee cup with both hands, positioned close to her face. Her nails are almond and a bright hot pink with Valentine's Day designs.

Her eyes are happy conveying a sense of warmth and enjoyment. She is wearing a hot pink knit Valentine's Day beanie and a denim jacket over a hot pink hooded sweatshirt, suggesting cool or cold weather. She has a dainty gold hoop in her nostril.

Do not change her facial features.

She has a petite slim body type.",6,1766852677.0,AiGeminiPhotoPrompts,1,0.88,False

For context my in-laws are elderly. My SIL lives with them and is their primary caregiver. My husband and I live a few hours away. We are visiting with our toddler. 

This morning my SIL went outside to shovel snow after heavy snowfall overnight. My husband and I were finishing our coffee while watching our child play. I asked my husband if he wanted to go help his sister shovel snow. He said he wanted to watch games on TV and relax. I felt this was wrong but from experience know he does not receive direct criticism well. But I felt bad that his sister was out shoveling and he can only think of relaxing and watching TV. So I asked him again and he said ""I'll ask her"". But made no move to do anything, and she was already outside. A while later his mom said, ""oh look your sister is shoveling the snow!"" I felt upset he was so unhelpful and asked him a third time. He blew up and stormed out extremely angry. He said that I was repeating until he ""followed instructions"", after he already said he ""wouldn't do it"". To me I shouldn't even have to tell him to go out and help his sister, who he acknowledges does everything already including taking care of their parents. AIO??

I clearly have nothing to gain here. It's not even anything about helping me. But I worry about this attitude and reaction to me telling him he should go help her. Did I mess up in choosing him as a life partner? He is generally ok otherwise and is helpful with our child and does other housework, but this kind of behavior is not infrequent.

\- Patch every new product - forearm and area behind ear worked for me (recommended to do the test 24 hours before usage, but as a busy working mom I could never wait longer than an hour. I applied generously on a chosen area and usually had a reaction within 1-5 minute for an aggressive product, within 20-40 mins for a product to stay away from and rarely had problems with products that did not provoke reaction within <1 hour. Doctors recommend to test 24-48 hours before using a new product.

\- Use very simple products - the more primitive - the better. As brutal as it sounds. 

\- Track your reactions in a symptom journal, especially if your skin tends to flare unpredictably. I kept my journal in Evernote (a notes app, now endlessly outdated).

\- Try your own basic ingredients formulas. For instance I ended up using yogurt and fermented herbs as facial and hand mask, emulsified extra virgin olive oil with herbs and lemon juice for facial, hand and body cream, organic acacia honey with coffee, herbs and salt for body scrub, etc.

**What to avoid:**  
  
\- Essential-oil-based beauty care (any essential oil is a potential MCAS demon)  
  
\- Fragrance / perfume (even “natural” plant scents can trigger flares)  
  
\- Strong surfactants (harsh foaming agents - labels often abbreviate these or hide them under “sulfates”: Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate (ALS), Ammonium Laureth Sulfate (ALES), TEA-Lauryl Sulfate, TEA-Sulfate, Sodium Myreth Sulfate, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate)

Even products that are “non-toxic” or “organic” can still trigger reactions if they use aromatic botanicals, complex preservative systems, or unnecessary additives

Ask questions. As a biotech scientist and an expert in MCAS-friendly ingredients (as it is my only life insurance!) I am here to help.

Take care and may calm mast cells be with you!

I’ve fallen in love. Or I have a huge crush on someone. We aren’t dating yet. But she really likes me a lot too. I’m a 23yo trans woman and she’s a 22yo trans woman. We met on an app and went on a coffee shop date and really hit it off. She’s so sweet and silly. We have common interests but also similar outlooks on life. I think she’s just a joy to be around. “Date” is underselling it just a bit. You can use your imagination on what that means because I don’t want to get too into the details. 

This woman makes me feel new emotions. I’ve met a lot of people, I’ve “been with” a lot of people. Ive had a boyfriend before (who I recently broke up with for mostly unrelated reasons) and we loved each other and still feel like I love him to an extent in a friend sort of way. But nobody has ever made me feel like this girl does. We’ve kept texting and calling and hanging out. Now I’ve met her friends, both of her girlfriends (she is poly) who I think/know I’m getting along well with. She accidentally let an “I love you” slip out on our second “date”. Like, I’m not entirely crazy because we’ve both said this feels different. I’m so head over heels for her and now I’m starting to be friends with or maybe even fall for her girlfriends.

The problem is that these emotions are so intense I’m struggling to rein myself in. I have enough self awareness to see this. I can see myself getting way too invested about this. Im imagining a future together with these people. It’s a honeymoon phase thing. I’m getting anxious about the idea of fucking it up or things not working out. The anxiety also plays off my insecurities. I worry about being good enough (although this has started to go away, I do feel like some of these women are ahead of me in certain aspects) and I really don’t like that my love has turned into stress. Also I’ve known these people for what like two weeks? There are so many things that could change and many many hypothetical ways this could end up not working, even if everything seems perfect right now. Like we even want to move to the same city. Idk.

I feel like a hormonal teenager again. There’s probably a number of other factors contributing to my emotions: My recent breakup, my other mental conditions that make my brain not normal, a life of trauma and relative isolation until more recently now that I’m a bit of a ways into transitioning and living as myself. But I think the hormones are playing a part and the fact that this is all new to me because I’ve never been this capable of happiness before.

So I guess my question is has anyone else experienced this and how the hell do I calm down about it??? Normally I’d be asking my therapist these things and not Reddit but my appointment isn’t until a bit into January. I have enough awareness to know my big emotions are a problem and could end up with me doing something dumb, trying to take it all too quickly. I’m very eager. I have a level of self control but I still feel all the intensity in my head. Can anyone provide some insight or advice on this? I’m happy to answer questions.

I am in my late twenties and 5'7"". Pre-pregnancy I was 125lbs. I gained about 30lbs during pregnancy and lost about 13lbs within a week of giving birth.

I am now six months (almost 7) postpartum and still exclusively breastfeeding. I just hit my goal of 130 (weighed in at 129 this morning). I'm not sure if I will set a new goal as I think this is a healthier weight for me than pre-pregnancy.

I did not start losing weight beyond the immediate post-birth drop until about 3-4 months. Then, I started losing approximately 1lb per week.

The main change I made was realizing that I had developed a habit of eating past satiety early in pregnancy, and it continued postpartum. I changed that, but I also cut down on refined sugar. I do not consume caffeine or alcohol at all. But I do drink a lot of decaf coffee :)

I don't do formal exercise but I do about 20 minutes of dance cardio a few times a week. My goal for 2026 is to exercise more.

With my last pregnancy at age 36 I had gestational diabetes for the first time. I was told it was very likely I would be diagnosed with T2D within a few years. I breastfed for a while and went back to the doctor. My labs didn't look great, I had fatty liver and my blood pressure was too high. I decided to have a gastric sleeve and then went on a GLP-1 after I stalled out for a year. Currently in a stall for the past couple of months on 1.2 mg of semaglutide and hoping this gives me some motivation.

The most difficult thing has been dealing with the nausea and the hair loss. Getting in my protein has also been a challenge. It's hard to pick up a protein shake when I really just want an iced coffee. Also my husband loves cooking for me so he's also had to adjust to the fact that just because I only eat a few bites doesn't mean I don't like the food. 

I am more active but I'm not active enough. That is one of my goals in 2026. (My college kid is always telling me to ""do more kettle bell swings!!!"", haha! So I'm finally going to take that advice to heart.) I have definitely had muscle loss and need to work to get that back. I particularly mourn the loss of my butt. 

Overall it's been a very positive experience and I'm so glad I decided to do this for myself. I want to be around for as long as possible for my kids and I love being able to be more active with them. Once I decided to treat my obesity as a medical condition instead of a personal moral failing, that's when I really started to be motivated to get this done. I was a good person when I was obese and I'm a good person now as a not obese person. I just want this body I live in to work as well as it can for as long as it can.",624,1766852353.0,progresspics,14,1.0,False
