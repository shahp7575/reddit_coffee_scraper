1gkx5ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1gkx5ix/why_would_men_leave_text_on_read_all_of_a_sudden/,Why would men leave text on read all of a sudden (previously texted 3-4x a day for 3 weeks on WhatsApp) so close to a wonderful 1st date? ,"Hi everyone,

I’m not in my 30s but in my early 40s. I haven’t dated in a while but almost all my friends agree that leaving messages on read (WhatsApp) and not at least acknowledge it is plain rude.

I have been talking to a guy for three weeks. We have been texting on the dating app and later on WhatsApp during this time. 3-4 x a day. 

Due to our work schedules we are only meeting for dinner on Friday. It’s our first date and we have loads in common. We even had a phone call and it was lovely, and short after the almost 2h phone call, he sent a message that I seem like a nice person and that he looks forward to seeing me in about ten days. He was a gentleman throughout. 

The date is now on Friday. He’s a busy guy (so am I) and he may have a lot of work pressure but he has been consistent and quick with texting, which gave me that consistency, commitment (to get to know someone) and safety that I look in people I date. I’m done with people that are jumping from one date to another because there are so many options only one swipe away. 

I wonder what has changed with him now. This all changed since he went to see his family over a family event. Though, there is nothing why a family would suggest against me IF he has shared something about me. I have done well in life and have no baggage, but he’s going through divorce. He reassured that his previous marriage is not something he’d ever reconsider and that the divorce is final. 

Do men act a bit weird with someone they have loads in common with in the run up to a first date? I just find his behaviour completely destroys the positive dynamic we have built and I worry this will negatively impact our first date. I’m naturally very positive, authentic and bubbly and now I feel so disconnected and distanced to him that I feel I can’t be myself - he in fact values authenticity so I wonder why I feel he stopped being authentic himself? Any help?

My last message is now over 34 hours ago - he read it and left it on read. It was something lighthearted and fun, as that’s how I want our date on Friday to be, him now acting weird on that sets a bad vibe in motion. 

PS: I’m 42F - he’s 49M. We both are too occupied with work etc to mess around. I haven’t dated in a long time out of choice as I’m very selective. People often say I’m attractive, don’t look my age and people love my personality. So I don’t think this has anything to do with me, I was also not clingy or upset of anything. I just don’t understand this type of behaviour which is also why I refrain from dating through apps. Now I’m confused how to act in front of him when having that dinner. 

I don’t even like dinners at fancy places on a first date because it’s awkward but agreed because we had a connection which is now fading. I’d much prefer a coffee shop and a walk in the park now, so in case he’s awkward I can keep it brief rather than being forced to finish a drink; a starter; a main and potentially another drink 😔 equally I don’t want to ruin it in case it does turn out well. For next time however, I’d never agree to a first date in a fancy place no matter the connection, as people change like the weather in this day and age.",1,1730895406.0,AskMen,0,0.67,False

1gkx4yy,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1gkx4yy/udacity_nanodegree_experience_c749/,Udacity Nano-degree Experience (C749),"This first class is insane. The first objective is to examine a dataset. My last experience with descriptive statistics was AP Stats in highschool, almost seven years ago. I thought there'd be more explanation on how to graph relationships dependent on whether data is categorical or numerical. I've come to understand that continuous numerical data is much more easily visualized with the methodologies employed in the lesson videos. 

Being an idiot, I decided to use a data set they provided that is full of binary categorical data. I'm doing the first project and it's taken me three days to understand a chi-squared value test and what it implies, how to make a function that takes two columns from a dataframe and spits out formatted results for a chi-squared test.

Add another day for making a function to plot bar charts of expected versus actual cross tabs.

I've finally gotten around to making a correlation matrix of the binary categorical variables, and at least Pearson's correlation was somewhat easier to understand. Though it did take me 2 hours of Google searching to arrive at the conclusion that using Pearson's for binary categorical data is fine because you end up with the Phi value.

I've also looked through the lessons on data visualization multiple times and can't see any instances where the instructors or interactive workspaces use seaborn, so I've elected not to use it even though their Jupyter kernel has it installed. I've read so much matplotlib documentation in the past 5 hours, my eyes might fall out. 

Anyway all this is to say that I'm slowly going insane, my brain is full of central measures, r's,  p's, phi's and chi's. I feel like there was a class before this that I missed somehow.

Does anyone have any tips? Has anyone had a similar experience?

1gkx2lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1gkx2lg/great_coffee_less_money/,"Great Coffee, Less Money","The purpose of this post is to bury the myth of good, delicious coffee can only be brewed by expensive equipment, and only by following a series of calibrated, sophisticated, precise steps. The myth that any coffee not obtained through such costly brewers and without passing through a maze of complex steps is not drinkable.  

The reason is I am writing this possibly long post is because I own some of these expensive brewing equipment, and I follow complex steps to make a simple cuppa. And the coffee is wonderful! And yet, I have friends who may not be able to afford these gears, or may have other interests they want to pursue and just want the pleasure of drinking coffee without having to research the science of it. So I understand the need of not spending to spend a lot of time, or money, or both, on making coffee. 

This post is for the newbie who's done a random google search about how to get into coffee, or which cheap coffee set-up is the best. This post is also for the wise and helpful members of this community who are often well intentioned when they recommend gears and recipies to newcomers but may fail to see their recommendations may not be practical to the one they're being offered to. This post is for anybody who feels coffee should be inclusive. That only such and such equipment can make good coffee, and only in this manner, is gatekeeping, financial, or by knowledge. And gosh don't we have enough borders already to now have one for those wanting to get into coffee!

So here is what I think a new coffee person on a tight budget needs to enjoy good coffee everyday.

1. A grinder.

2. French Press/Moka Pot

3. Weighing Scale (or cups, baskets etc that one knows hold roughly x grams, x mls)

So firstly, which grinder to buy, And IF to buy. Because, pre-ground. One thing that almost everyone knows about coffee is it smells great, especially when you grind it fresh. But soon enough starts to lose its aroma, and taste. Once you open a pack of preground coffee, that process of coffee losing its aroma and  taste has started. It is a race against time. Every day the coffee is getting worse and worse. Why would one spend money on quality coffee and then let it deteriorate. Refrigerating it is worse because you introducing humdity everytime you open it. So do not skip the grinder.

But what grinder? Is it the end of the road if you can't afford the Timemore C2. And then you realise C2 is only the cheapest entry level grinder. Honestly, no, you can't afford C2 - doesn't matter. Go search a  manual grinder, sort from low price to high. The cheapest burr grinder I can see right now, (and which is one of the grinders I have), is a generic chinese make that costs 600 Rs. It does a satisfactory job of grinding for moka pot, and a passable one for French Press. Don't believe it. Well, you will believe James Hoffman, won't you? Here is a link where he tries it out (not one, but two of them - both branded differently but essentially the same grinder). If the internet's most popular coffee sommelier can drink coffee ground by it, so can a newbie on a  budget. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLEBfom0mhM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLEBfom0mhM)

As you can see the exact same grinders cost him 25 GBP, and 70 GBP, and it costs what 5 GBP in India. This is how branding works.

About grinding I will say for the moka pot, you can even get away with grinding coffee beans in a mixie for an occasional cup, Clean mixie, without smells and oils and left over stuff. But long term, you'll have to maintain a separate mixie, and coupled with the compromise on taste, it is not a grinder replacement even at a very low budget.

Secondly, brewer. Moka Pot helps make a coffee concentrate that you can drink neat, dilute with water, or add milk to. It is fairly simple to use, and you don't even need a weighing scale for it. It has three chambers. In the bottom you fill a set amount of water, on it you sit a basket and fill it with ground coffee, you screw the upper chamber on this which is empty. You put it on a low flame. In 3-5 mins the water from the lower chamber will pass through the coffee basket and percolate in the upper chamber. You have your coffee.

For the moka pot, while there are many cheap options, I hesitate to recommend any as if not manufactured properly, at best they may make bad coffee, but at worst, they may not be able to release excess pressure and become dangerous. Hence, my recommendation would be the Bialetti which is the traditional classic Italian brewer. It is expensive - and the only mitigating factor is a Bialetti can last generations.

If Bialetti is not an option, but all you need is a long, black coffee, the French Press does the job. Essentially it is only a glass carafe where you put coffee and water, with a filter to press down upon coffee. The brand etc doesn't matter (the chepeast right now is 350Rs for a 350ml French Press). Sure, the quality of filter differs from brand to brand, but a basic filter is good enough. Just remember to get a French Press that has indications for volume of water (100 ml, 200 ml and so on).  By its nature French Press has some coffee grit it it. But the sludge settles down while the coffee cools, and once you let it rest in the cup for a few minutes the coffee is deliciously full-bodied.

Finally, and especially for a French Press, you need an understanding of coffee ratios and a way to measure the coffee and water you're adding to it. Ratiowise, a good starting point is 1:14. For every 1 gm of coffee, add 14 grams of water. A weighing scale is helpful to measure this. But if you dont want to buy a scale, take a scoop full of beans to a friend who diets and weighs the food they eat, if lets say the scoop can hold 7 grams of coffee, you can add 2 scoops of coffee, measure out some water in a 200 ml bottle, heat it, and add it to the French Press and there you have an (almost) 1:14 ratio without a scale.

At the lowest this set up should set you back by 1000 Rs, and at worst by 3000 Rs. But the most crucial thing in how coffee tastes is.... surprise, surprise... coffee. So never, ever compromise on delicious coffee beans. The rest, grinders, brewers, complex recipies, are just scenery. Don't let them stop you or your friends from having great coffee. Finally, coffee is about the stories and conversations and people you share them with. It is that, and not what equipment it was brewed on and with how many steps, that you'll always remember.

                       THE START

  Meeting you felt like a movie from the start!... you instantly melted my heart from the moment I saw you to our first date having our Cawffee at warbler.(still thought it was spelled coffee then 😬) Those early days it saddened me to see such a beautiful woman and presumably beautiful soul to have so much sadness behind those beautiful eyes that longed to be happy again. I felt an instant connection that felt like a bolt of lightning that struck through my veins. Through the days I would get to know you and we'd go through our adventures at local restaurants you'd never been to, to my empty apartment🫣, to meeting all your friends and co-workers(which were awesome and love you so much) every day with you no matter what we did seem to be undoubtedly the best days I'd had in a very very long time! And then to make things even more like a movie it would turn out that we were both about to start a big new chapter in our lives that had us leaving our hometown and loved ones behind.

                  New cities, Same us x2
   
   Moving to a New city seemed to only bring us closer together and further strengthen our bond as best friends and lovers and soul mates. I couldn't help but feel that I had met my person in this world. From movie nights at your new place, to pizza and popcorn nights at mine. To theater moments at the palladium in your town to Alamo drafthouse movie nights in mine(pizza and wine). To San Marcos and Schertz at our meet in the middle nights. To our ride back to Brownsville together times. I was indeed convinced I was living in a movie better than any of our movie nights combined.

                        The Twist 😔 
  Every movie has one... a twist. And often times art imitates life.... and our story was no exception. Your ex lover would be moving in with you to be your roommate 😵‍💫🤕💔🤔. My mind was telling me to spare myself the trouble and heartache and just run. Sentiments that everyone close to me also shared. They advised me and some even demanded i run away and stay away. But the heart had other ideas... the heart wanted to believe in hope, in you, and in love. All of a sudden logic was swept out the window and nobody's opinion was valid nor wanted. After all they hadn't seen our intense connection! Our Tawlkes(use to think it was talks) that would last hours upon hours!!! (Believe our record was close to 7 hours straight!!! 🤯) they didn't know the hell you had claimed this guy had put you through and were fed up with, and ready to move on from to move with a person that truly could put a smile on your face and make you feel happy for the first time in a long time! Which i was doing! How could I leave, I wouldn't leave!, Our love could surely pull us through this temporary moment and would reward us with a lifetime of happiness.... right?    

                          WRONG!!!!!

    Not much Details are needed at this part of the roller-coaster. You would indeed end up sleeping and fucking your ex lover.... Lies, deceit, betrayal and confusion now rained down with havoc and no remorse like the bhola cyclone! Once again the heart was wrong, I was wrong. The once upon a time Movie of true love and fate was now a nightmare and horror movie instead! Eerily and rightfully unraveling in the middle of October. (Spooky season!  Fuck you! Spooky season) was it all a ruse? Had the connection just been in my head? Had all our talwks just been littered with lies with a trickle of truths? It must have been😔😔😔.and what is the only thing worse than the ruthless betrayal of sleeping with him?


                      The LIES

The trail of ruthless lies! Over and over and over again. And then over again. Even after everything I wanted to seek for something in you that could once again ignite my heart that for reasons unknown was still in it. It couldn't have all been a lie? Well.... that was rewarded with more and more lies... the movie was now slowly coming to a dreadful end.
   
                        SELF - REFLECTION 

   As I self reflect on it all, the best thing I can do now is shut the heart up and now finally go with the logic. The facts are, he meant more to you than I ever could. Why else would you throw us away to go back to him?. You used me to get him back and it worked....(good play) the lies and lies that would ensue were just extra toppings on what was a well planned orchestra of deceit. With all the information at hand I will always remember this as the time I was most wrong about someone ever in my life. 

                           In conclusion 

   Life doesn't always have a happy ending. Not even in movies 😔. At the end we are 2 human beings just trying to navigate through this crazy world the best we can. All the great times we had will always be cherished.... there was just too many. It was just being next to you, it was just seeing you smile and hearing your laugh that gave me the biggest joy of all! ❤️❤️❤️and I'm glad to have atleast been a part of that, lie or not. For atleast for a moment love and fate seemed more than possible, it seemed real!. They say only fools rush in, and that's exactly what I did, so the ending should have never really been a surprise after all(my bad). At the very end you showered me with absolut truths about us and you and everything!. I hope these truths will bring you solace as it has to me. I will forever deeply appreciate that! Thank you!!! Thank you so much. (Wish you had done that from the beginning) As we both turn into new chapters in our lives I wish you nothing but luck at your new place and with Sergio. You see I believe that no one truly deserves happiness nor a fairytale ending, but that one must do their best to be welcomed to it! And that takes hard decisions, and actions that are not always easy but they lead you in that way. I loved you and connected with you more than I'd probably had ever connected with anyone. but you are not good for me, you are currently not good for yourself stuck in a Neverending toxic situation. So therefore to try and once again find happiness in this life I must remove myself from you no matter how much it rips me up to do it 😔😔😔. I know you claim to be moving on from him and claim to give me the world.... but there is nothing from you I longer want other than Space, and your own pursuit of happiness. Bye my guerra, my love, my baby and once upon a time absolute best friend.

Day 1: Arrived by train on Sat from Bologna. Couldnt check in yet, so had lunch at Risotteria Melotti. I realize this is a chain but as the only risotto ive had so far this trip, was impressed. Gelato at My Sugar, mom loved the black sesame. Free walking tour from 3:30-5:30, highly recommended to learn more about the city and get some good local recommendations (he had a google doc for us). Also wandered around Mercato Centrale, wow the 2nd floor makes a north amercian food court look like trash, which it usually is. Didnt eat anything, but so much looked good and it was packed. 

Dinner at Il Latini, be sure to make a reso. Had the 1.7kg porterhouse, potatos, and tiramisu. Stuffed. Streets were packed today, long weekend and all. 

Day 2: Morning run along the Arno and up to Piazzale Michelangelo for sunrise, love early mornings and especially here, quiet and peaceful. Given it was the first Sunday, and state museums were free, we lined up first for the Accademia. Was about a 40minute line, but worth it. Had the free Rick Steve audio guide, very good. 

Next was the Uffuzi, another big lineup, about 45min that went all the way around. Wow this place is massive. Used the rick steve audioguide again, which showcased the significant artworks, but not necessarily comprehensive. Wouldn't have appreciated it without the guide. Very busy inside as expected given it was free. Took a break at the cafe, expensive and nothing to write home about, but a little refreshment and snack on a patio was needed. 

Lined up again for lamprodetto at Trippaio del Porcellino, I eat tripe at home but this was different. 

We walked across to Palazzo Pitti. We were too late for the boboli gardens, but honestly just seeing the grandeur of the palace was enough. One of the most spectacular palaces Ive seen. 

Dinner at Osteria Cinghiale Bianco. No reso, but we we were there at 6pm and got a table. Ordered the onion flan, boar ragu, and boar with polenta and tiramisu. Food and service were great. Seems lots of the poor reviews for different cafe/restos are due to poor service, but havent encountered that at all. If anything, servers have been too quick to ask me what Id like on the menu. 

Day 3:

I didnt book the Brunelleschi Pass early enough, so only got the 6pm time slot for the dome. Pass is activated that day, so in the morning, went up the bell tower at 8:15am opening. My mom had no issues with the stairs, and we enjoyed a beautiful morning from the top. Nobody rushed us down, and probably spent 30 minutes up there. Went for a caffe, and then went inside the baptistry. You cant see the mosiacs due to restoration, and we had seen the impressive ones in Ravenna already. Both the free entrance and the crypt entrance had a big looking lineup, but it was only about 20minutes to get in. The crypt was fascinating, while the interior of the Duomo was barren as expected. But still interestimg to look up at the dome, my main interest. 

Next was the Galileo/science museum. Really interesting collection of scientific instruments, as somebody with an engineering background, this was fascinating. Definitely download the app beforehand to get more info about the displays. For a non-science person with limited time, you could probably skip this. 

Went for a quick walk through the Duomo Museum after. Would have saved this for next day, Tuesday, but its closed on the first Tues. great view of the dome from the terrace on the 3rd floor. 

Lined up at 5:30pm for our 6pm dome climb so we would be in front. Mom and i loved the dome climb, the claustrophobic stairs were a treat. i didnt think it was redundant to go up both the dome and tower, but if i were to redo it, id go up the dome at sunset. 

Went for pizza at Pizzium, would have gone to Gusta, but closed on Monday. The two ""regional"" pizzas, puglia and lombardia. Great service, fast, and not too busy. 

Day 4: While Florence was beautiful, it felt busy with all the traffic and taxis on the streets. Couldn't decide between Siena or Lucca as a daytrip (no, we didnt try to go to Cinque Terre), and settled on Sienna by bus. Bought a ticket from the bus station, those paper receipts/tickets are tricky to validate, yoi have to fold them in half to insert, whereas the tickets from the self-serve machine are smaller and fit in. 

Easy walk from bus stop to Piazza Campo. Favourite Piazza so far. paid 10euro for the ticket to climb up Torre Mangia. Not busy at all, bought my ticket, waited for 10:45am. You only get about 15minutes up there, but it was a spectacular view. Love these medieval towers and super narrow staircases. 

Had coffee at Torrefazione Fiorella and delicious panini at Bocconcino, my favourite so far, and convenient to eat nearby. 

Paid 5euro for the duomo entrance only. Used the Rick Steve guide again, wow, spectacular inside and outside. We walked around some more,  just checking out the little streets and views before the 4:45pm bus back to Florence. I'll need to spend some more time in these tuscan towns next time. 

Hop off the bus and had dinner The Antico Ristoro di Cambi. florentine steak, potatos, onion were great. Personally, I prefer my steak more on the medium rare side, but was enjoyable to try it here anyways. 

Day 5:

Went for a run along the river, and then packed up bags. Grabbed a sandwich at Antico Vinaio for the train ride to Roma. Might be touristy, but there was no lineup, convenient and delicious on the train. 

Next and final spot, Roma! Already have the Vatican and Colosseum booked, four full days to explore, welcoming recommendations! Grazie!",3,1730894370.0,ItalyTravel,1,1.0,False
1gkwtxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gkwtxy/idk_what_to_feel_or_what_to_dostorytime/,Idk what to feel. Or what to do…(Storytime) ,"Hey I am confused.

I’m just gonna vent and let everyout…..So a week ago I got broken up with. I’m trying to understand what is going on. So two days before the breakup she asked me to bring her coffee while I was on my way to work, and I said sure. So I got the coffee and I accidentally send her videos that were supposed to go to my female friend coworker, and so my ex got super upset about that and said I was talking bad about her. I apologized cause I didn’t remember what I sent. She saved the video and I watched it and to be honest….im not saying anything bad. I’m literally talking about some HW (Homework) that I was working on and then I say “Then I had to go get some coffee since my gf wanted some coffee” and then  “Can you go get coffee” imitating my ex. I don’t really see that big of an issue with that and I felt like it was blown out of proportion to just make me feel bad for talking to someone other than her. So she ignored me all day until she left from work and told me how I was talking S*** about her and that I probably always talk about her to other people, and I’m like no I don’t and continuously apologize. So she suggests that we take some time apart and I agree. So I told her I’m gonna go ghost and told I’m not gonna talk to anyone, be on socials, and just take the time to process. And she said alright. 

Alright so it was one day since she suggested the time apart and I wake up and find out that she just unadded and blocked me from everything, erased all our memories, and took me out of her bio. Basically I’m erased like nothing. I wait half the day seeing if she’s gonna reach out and she doesn’t so I reach out and say “Can we talk? Let me know when you’re available too.” And she says “Nope. Don’t want to talk to you anymore, I think it’s best we just go our own ways”. So that just left me shocked and the conversation continues with her explaining that I never initiated anything, I didn’t get anything for the anniversary, that I ghosted her for 3 days, and that time apart means to not see each other not to communicate (I didn’t know that cause she didn’t communicate that). She tells me she’s not happy, and hasn’t been. She tells me that I’m f****** mean and that she’s done. She then send me a huge paragraph talking about how I talked so much s*** to my female coworker friend and that if I want to talk about her to not talk to such a disrespectful b**** to her. She then says I have a lot of s*** I got to work on. I then tell her how dumbfounded I am it is for her to just delete me like nothing, and that I didn’t ghost her for 3 days it has been one day without talking, one day. I explain to her that I don’t talk shit about her and I’m only just talking to my female coworker and that’s it. She then said “See you don’t care about me, this conversation is over”. 

I need to add context with the anniversary. First we both worked on our anniversary so we didn’t celebrate it that day, we tried to celebrate it the following Wednesday but she got mad at me for not making an effort on Monday or Tuesday (I worked both of those days) and mad that I didn’t get her flowers or a gift. I owned up to that and apologized and I felt horrible….i explained to her that we were gonna celebrate it today. But she just gave me my gifts and said that she was gonna do what she wanted to do and just go to the gym by herself. We talked about it and I took her myself and got her flowers and told how sorry I am and told her we’d go out the next day. So we went out and I made her a bouquet and gave it to her and we spent the whole day together, going to the gym, watching movies, going to Topgolf, and getting some food and eating it at my place. 

Now back to breakup. I call her and she says that she is just done. And I ask her “Honestly and openly are you really done with this relationship yes or no?” And she says “yes I’m done, you’re a fucking asshole, you’re egotistical with a big ass ego, and you’re lazy and not doing anything with your life” I then tell her “Wow….well that hurt. And before I could say anything else she hung up on me. 

I went to work the next day and it was rough cause I just couldn’t understand how everything changed so quickly. I gave her the time and space and she’s mad at me for not talking to her after a day. So my mind just kept racing and racing. I didn’t go to work that entire weekend and searched for answers, I even called 988 just to talk to someone because I don’t really have anyone to talk to. She then messaged me on Sunday asking “Are you ok?” and I called her, I couldn’t even get any words out and just sounded so mumbled. She said “I can’t talk right now, I’m at work but you can message me”. Which I understand. So we start texting and I explain that I need to talk to her, and that I miss her. She just hits me with “Why do you care now?” “You didn’t care before, and if you did it was little”. She says “I feel like you just don’t care about me”, she spent time on the anniversary and that all i did was get her flowers. And of course I feel horrible and tell her that I’m sorry and I want to fix this, and she says “Why do you want to fight for me now?” Which hurts. She then proceeds to say “Idk, I just need time you broke my heart”. 

She agreed to meet up later that day and I made her a collage of out memories, cut up some flowers and taped them, got her some of her favorite snacks, a plushie, and a blanket. And we talked and I showed her the collage and we just talked and talked. I explained to her that I love her and I care about her a lot. And she told me the same she just doesn’t know. I apologized for my wrongs and owned up yet again.  We made out and one thing lead to another and I thought we were good, but she told me she needed time and she’d call me on Tuesday after therapy if she wanted to continue this or not. I told her if yes I’d love to take her out on a date. 

So Tuesday comes and I’m kind of excited and fingers crossed, I wake up at 2am because I am so nervous. Time goes by and she calls me at 3pm and she tells me that I wanted an answer after therapy, and I say yes. She then says “Well idk, if I were to give you an answer right now it would be a no, because I’m still very hurt with what you did and I just don’t know if I can trust after that, i love you and I care about you a lot, I have some stuff I need to work on and you have some stuff you need to work on. I just need time and I would want this in the future and I’ll let you know if I want this but for now I’m just burnt out” And you know that fucking hurt, cause I just feel like a plaything and I got my hopes up. I then ask her “So like what are we together are we not, do I wait or?” And she says “No you do you, I’m working on myself right now and you should too, I just don’t know right now and I need time” and I’m like “Ok well hopefully I hear from you about this”. So I let her go and of course fucking cry, and then you know what happens she adds me back on everything and just starts spamming that she’s working on herself, she needs someone that values her, she needs some that truly loves her, etc. And I can see all that she then posts about a concert festival saying “Don’t care if I got to go alone I’m gonna go” and I send another link to the festival and she says “Badass huh” and I’m like “yeah….” And she’s like “What?” And I’m like “Nevermind” and she’s says “You’re gonna ask if we should go huh” and I said “Yeah” and she said “Possibly” and I’m like “Well doesn’t sound like you’d want me to so” and she says “Well idk that’s way into the future, and I’m not worried about that right now” and I said “Yeah it just hurts to see since we’ve been to shows before and usually you’d let me know about a show” and she says “You can’t say it just hurts when you’re the one that did this to yourself plus I did think about you when I saw it” and I’m like “What?! If you thought about me why didn’t you send it, can you understand how that feels” and she says “Idk if we’re gonna be together like? And also why do you care what I send you like?” And I respond with “……I always cared”. And she says “Well we’re not together right now and you didn’t share it so how was I supposed to know”. Even though I shared it with her. 

Hopefully you’re confused as I am in this whole situation. I just feel like a throwaway something that’s on the back burner. I feel stupid because I actually tried to fight for her and feel like it was pointless. I know myself that I can’t wait and it sucks to literally see her post shit that is aiming that you did this. Like pointing fingers in a sense. I won’t lie you probably see some toxic and yeah I do. I’m like stuck at what to do, is it even worth preserving? Is this my fault? What could I have done? And lastly probably the dumbest question, Do I take her back? ",1,1730894347.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Anyways after some months of experimenting with different yerbas and equipment, this is my type of mate definetely. I’m not into barbacua flavors, also i get some stomach discomfort (similar ti when i was having too much coffee)  when having those types of yerbas.

I met this girl by a chance encouter 3 yrs back when she happened to be one of my students of a short course. I liked her rightaway, granted she's extremely good looking but I have met many good looking women and I have never felt this way before. I didnt act on it though and kept things extremely professional but noted her nonetheless. She was usually reserved, hard working, had few friends. She never deliberately showed interest but I had a feeling she liked me as well as she usually avoided only my eye contact and the one time that she did look into my eyes she just froze and turned. Anyway, I wasnt looking to be tied down at that time and was focused on my career and had a feeling she was doing the same.

Fast forward to present, I'm quite settled now in my career as a consultant and she's working on her way to be one, my parents decided its time for me to get married. Call me an idiot, but no other girl was able to take her place all these years. They were always somehow subpar to her. I lived in denial for awhile, telling myself its just lust and will go away with time but I couldn't have been more wrong. Because the only person I could imagine myself settling down to is her. After a lot of thought, I told my parents about her. I know her address and that her family is not very conservative about caste and all. My parents talked to hers via someone for her hand in marriage and they have apparently spoken to her. To my greatest surprise, she wanted to meet me.

We met in a coffee shop and she was every bit the person I perceived her to be. Reserved, ambitious, smart, extremely straight forward in a no bull shit kind of way, the perfect balance between traditional and modern views, God fearing, surprisingly very sarcastic as well. I am totally smitten with her. Obsessed with her. Hence the post. Because I do not think I'm in a place to judge her about what she told me. And that too in the second meeting itself, that she was in a relationship with a guy of another faith about 3 yrs back, ended right around the time I came into her life. I'm mentioning the faith because thats one of the critical reasons she broke up with him. That guy apparently promised he would never ask her to convert in the beginning and later on started bashing her faith and she's a very spiritual person who do pujas and all. Along with that, he also verbally abused her and eventually cheated on her. This relationship lasted for about a year and half. She told me I came into her life when she was in a man-hating phase and determined to stay away from relationships hence ignored me at all costs. But she told she felt the same way about me as well, couldnt forget me all these years and the alliance call almost felt like a dream come true.

But she wants me to step into this relationship with my eyes wide open and not be led by hormones. Her exact words. She told me she has kissed him, he has seen her half naked once, but that she's a virgin. They booked a hotel once because there was no other way for any kind of privacy for kissing or cuddling which she said was all she allowed herself to before marriage, even when she thought he was the one she's gonna marry. Apparently the guy begged her and hence the half naked thing happened but she was not comfortable and he was gentleman enough to not force her. So nothing more happened. And that was the only time. While hearing all this, not gonna lie, I felt like dying because why would she say such things when she knows how I feel about her and theres just no way of me knowing these excruciating details even if she didnt tell (no photos/videos/chats). She also clarified that she blocked him from everywhere and hates him with a passion. Apparently he didnt let her go easily, stalked her and made her life hell until his parents made him marry someone. She told me if I decide to marry her, from that moment, there would be no secrets. That Her crazy Ex may contact her in some way in the future too but the moment he does, she will tell me. Her phone, whatsapp, Insta/FB, mail nothing would be off limits for me and she expected the same from me.

She also told she will only divorce me if I cheated on her. Loyalty is everything to her. Everything else, we will find a way to work it out. She said she knows I'm a good man and will not be abusive to her. She wants me to put aside my butterflies and raging hormones and take a decision. I tried but I'm so in love with her that I cannot think rationally. She's my first love and probably the love of my life.

For context: She's an extremely beautiful woman, from a well to do family, more than mine so its not my money she's after in any way. She has inheritance while whatever I have are all earned through my blood and sweat. I have also noticed how guys always surrounded her and she paid no attention to them. She only accepts friend requests from known people, I know this because she kept one of my friends waiting because she didnt know who he was 🤣 She's my perfect woman in every way. She thinks because I havent been in a relationship before Im kind of naive and leading with my emotions. Can I get your honest opinions? Please be respectful. I love this girl.",1,1730893937.0,RelationshipIndia,3,0.67,False

What is Food Science?

Types of Food Science.

Why is Food Science Important?

Careers in Food Science.

 

Food Science: It is the basic and applied science of food. Its scope overlaps with agricultural and nutritional sciences. It covers food safety and processing. It informs food technology development.

Food science brings together many scientific disciplines. It incorporates chemistry, physics, physiology, microbiology, and biochemistry concepts. E.g. Food technology incorporates concepts from chemical engineering.

Food scientists develop new food products. They design processes to make these foods. They choose packaging materials, conduct shelf-life studies, and test products. This includes surveys of potential consumers, microbiological, and chemical tests.

Food is vital to our planet. But, climate change and a growing population may make it less accessible.

# What is [Food Science](https://medium.com/@manoj_chettiar/what-is-food-science-and-why-is-food-science-important-58745cd858d0)?

**Food science**: is a multidisciplinary field. It seeks to solve real-world problems in food production. Consumers require secure, healthy food that is easily available at present. Food scientists help farmers, grocers, and other businesses meet those demands.

The science of food involves studying:

· Food composition

· Preparation

· Processing

· Preservation

· Effects on human health

# Types of Food Science

There are several different areas of food science. Food scientists usually pick one area to specialize in. However, there is some overlap between the subfields.

**Food Chemistry:** A big part of food science is knowing the molecular structure of our food.

**Food Engineering**: Food engineers are key in the food production pipeline. They explore processes, from our packaging materials to preserving ingredient freshness.

 **Food Microbiology:** Food microbiologists study microbes, pathogens, and other microorganisms present in food.

**Sensory Analysis**: This food science subfield tests food using the five senses: taste, touch, smell, sound, and sight.

# Why is food science important?

Food scientists work to ensure enough safe, healthy food for all people and animals. This includes food for livestock and pets. Studying food helps us understand the plants and animals we eat. It also helps us improve food systems to make them more efficient and sustainable.

# Below are the six main reasons why food science is important now and in the future.

# 1. Enhancing Food Safety

Food safety and quality will continue to be a key part of sustainability as the Earth warms. Food safety issues tackled by food scientists include:

· Reducing outbreaks of foodborne illnesses

· Improving food shelf life

· Creating safe packaging

Food technology advancements boost safety in the food industry. For example, scientists found they can use high pressure or light to sterilize foods. If you are interested in food safety, consider specializing in food microbiology.

# 2. Improving Nutritional Quality

Scientists only began to understand nutrition within the past century. Food science can help us. It shows the nutrients we need. It also shows how to enhance foods to meet those needs.

Many foods already contain added iron or folic acid, such as bread and cereal. Enhancing the nutrition of popular, easy-to-find foods can boost public health.

*Learn food production techniques like* ***hydroponics*** *through a* ***sustainable horticulture program***\*.\*

# 3. Extending Shelf Life

*Humans have used fermentation, canning, and cooling to preserve food for centuries. Refrigerators are a key food science invention. They prolong food storage duration significantly.*

*While we have made a lot of progress, there is still room to grow in this area of food science.* **Food waste** *is a huge problem across the world. In the US, people waste 30-40% of the total food supply. By using science and technology, we can extend the shelf life of foods that are often wasted.*

# 4. Innovating Culinary Experiences

*A modern supermarket is packed with a variety of global foods. They are ready to delight our culinary senses. Consumers owe the variety of products to sensory scientists, chemists, and food engineers. They transform raw ingredients into the foods we see on the shelves.*

*A great example of food science is the* **manufacturing and preparation of coffee**\*. Without food science, coffee would be available only in a small, equatorial region. Coffee's fermenting, storing, shipping, roasting, and brewing involve many food science fields.\*

*Excellent food starts with the right ingredients.*

# 5. Addressing Global Food Challenges

Worldwide, there is a growing demand for food. Food accessibility remains a barrier in many parts of the world. Food scientists can improve the food supply chain. They can solve problems and create cheap, nutritious food for underserved areas, like urban ""food deserts."" One way to do this is to empower communities to farm in cities.

# 6. Managing food allergies and sensitivities.

One of the many food technology benefits is managing food allergies and sensitivities. Food science helps find **allergens**. It also creates safe foods for those with dietary restrictions. **Lactose-free milk** lets lactose-intolerant people enjoy cow's milk. Food science also brought us **gluten-free** bread and plant-based imitation meat products.

# Careers in Food Science

*There are many careers for those interested in both food and science. You can work as a:*

· Food technologist

· Flavor chemist

· Quality control specialist

· Food microbiologist

· Sensory analyst

· Research scientist (life sciences)

· Chef

· Toxicologist

· Health Improvement Practitioner

· Regulatory affairs officer

· Retail buyer

· Procurement manager

Not only is this job important, but it is also a **smart career choice.**

In 2022, the average yearly salary for food scientists was $85,730. Jobs in the field will grow by 8% in the next decade, experts say. This is faster than the average job growth rate. If you prefer fieldwork to research, consider these sustainable agriculture jobs.

Is it possible to find something with picturesque outdoor settings—on quiet streets, tucked in gardens, or along waterfronts—where the natural world is the main part of the experience, and where you don't have the loud, shouting phone conversations of people at adjoining tables? Dim lights vs bright lights...quiet music if any, vs loud music?  

Back around 20 years ago and change, a good example of this would have been my favorite hangout -  Sleeping Wood, near the old Holiday Inn and down the street from Garden Hotel.  Even Hill Bar had outdoor seating, or Elephant Bar, or Mango Tree also had a nice outdoor seating section, under the trees and without conversation-drowning music.  

I'm hoping that while the weather is so very nice now that it is November, there would be a few places to sit outside, sip some nice cold beers, and enjoy the beautiful weather before it turns cold.

i dont know what other workouts i should be implementing but ive been walking near 10k a day, havent seen much of a difference. is my weight loss just occuring VERY slowly or am i stuck in a plateau? i dont have the funds for a gym membership but i need to shed this extra weight/help build muscle fast

Usually, I'm quite hesitant about booking through anything but direct channels, mainly because I like having full control and direct contact with the airline. However, a last-minute trip came up, and the best price I could find was on Trip.com. It was significantly cheaper than the others, so I thought, ""Why not?""

Admittedly, I didn't know much about the app, and given my skepticism towards third-party services, I spent quite a bit of time poking around the app before my flight. I wanted to make sure I had all my bases covered. What pleasantly surprised me was how the app managed boarding information. I’ve had my share of annoying experiences with other apps where I had to dig through menus just to find my boarding details.

With [Trip.com](http://Trip.com), all the essential information was right there on the home feed of the app. No scrolling through menus or clicking multiple times to find what I needed. This was particularly handy, as it meant I could check my flight details quickly while juggling my luggage and coffee at the airport.

What stood out even more was that I could add my boarding information to my phone's home screen. This was a game-changer. It meant I didn’t have to constantly unlock my phone and open the app to check gate numbers or any last-minute changes. Everything was just a glance away, right from my home screen.

This feature was a small but significant convenience that genuinely made a difference in my travel experience. It made me less anxious about missing important updates and allowed me to navigate through the airport more confidently. While I’ll always have a bit of a preference for booking directly, [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) definitely offered a smooth and stress-free service that I didn’t expect from a third-party booking site",0,1730891659.0,traveladvice,0,0.5,False

Chapter 7,"*What the?* Boron thought when Nitride flinched next to him. He looked over at Steelblade, noticing his father had noticed something as well. He caught a look of confused fear in the steelwing’s bright blue eye. *Wait a minute.* Boron thought as he looked closer at Steelblade, confirming that his eye was not its usual green. T shifted to its usual green after a second as he looked at Nitride with cautious fear. *I’ll ask him later.* Boron thought as he turned his attention to his daughter. 

“You ok?” Boron asked softly, causing Nitride to flinch slightly. It somewhat hurt Boron to see his daughter flinch at him. 

“F-fine.” Nitride replied with a shaky tone. Boron put his wing over her and pulled her closer to him. Nitride shuffled closer so she was leaning against him with her chin resting on his shoulder. 

“I’m here for you if you need me.” Boron said softly as he put his arm around her. “You don’t have to hide anything from us.” Boron looked back at Steelblade out of the corner of his eye and saw the steelwing take a deep breath before going back to talking amongst the crew, clearly distracted by something. 

“We all ready for the borealis in a few days?” Icesurge said with excitement as he leaned against Boron’s other side before putting his wing over the hybrid. Boron looked at his husband, who had his own chin on Boron’s other shoulder, looking up at him with love in his eyes. Boron couldn’t help but chuckle and touch his nose with the icewing’s. 

“As long as I’m with you and our daughter.” Boron started, love in his voice. “I’m ready for anything.” 

“Sounds familiar doesn’t it Blade?” Meerkat asked the steelwing. He snorted in reply. 

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” The ancient dragon replied. Boron could see a look of pride in the steelwing’s eye as he looked at Boron. 

“Well dinner’s here if you think you can hold back on your family bonding to eat.” Cavemaker joked from where he and Canary sat, Dawnbreaker between them. The crew chuckled. 

Boron woke up in the middle of the night to a coldish snout nosing its way under his wing. Boron lifted his head to see Nitride trying to get under his wing. Boron lifted his wing, put it over her and pulled her closer to him. She curled up next to him, shivering. *Strange.* Boron thought. *She never shivered before. Not even next to Surge. And she seemed fine when we first got here.* He put his head back on his talons, cheek in contact with Icesurge’s cheek as he leaned against his husband. 

Boron woke up early the next morning, he wanted to talk to his father about something. He carefully made his way out of between his husband and daughter, carefully shifting Nitride to be next to Icesurge. Boron saw Icesurge instinctively put his wing over the tribrid as she shifted closer. Boron made his way through the apartment and found his father in the kitchen with a cup of coffee. 

“What in the hell was she doing there?” Boron heard Steelblade whisper to himself. 

“Dad?” Boron addressed the steelwing, causing him to jump. 

“Oh. Hey son.” Steelblade said with a quick shake of his head. 

“Did you notice Nitride’s little scared jump at dinner last night?” Boron asked. 

“I noticed…… something.” Steelblade replied. Boron looked at  his father with curiosity. “Maybe it’s just being back in the ice kingdom and this close to the palace.” 

“What happened?” Boron asked, worry starting to creep into his voice. “Your eye had went a bright blue for a few seconds.” 

“There was an outline of an icewing next to Nitride.” Steelblade replied with a hint of fear. 

“What has you so scared?” Boron asked with confusion. The only time he’d heard his father scared was when his family was threatened. 

“She knew my name.” Steelblade replied as he grabbed one of Boron's shoulders. “She was vaguely familiar with some kind of disturbing presence.” Boron looked his father in the eye for a second, seeing the dark green slowly shift to blue. 

“We don’t have to stay here.” Boron suggested. He knew his father was probably the most resilient dragon on Pyrrhia, but his wounds probably took down his resistance to the elements. “If you aren’t enjoying it here-“

“I’ll be fine.” Steelblade replied shakely as he drank some more of his coffee. “I dealt with Talon, I’m sure I can deal with some hallucinations.” Boron could tell his father was trying to joke, but he still had a hint of fear in his voice. “Wasn’t the borealis estimated to start today? That’ll take my mind off things.” Steelblade downed the rest of his coffee before going back to the room him and Meerkat shared. Boron watched his father’s uneasy limps with worry. *This didn’t happen before.* Boron thought. *Are dad and Nitride’s change in personality connected?* Boron decided he’d try and figure it out after the vacation so no one got worried any more. *I’ll just keep an eye on both of them and make sure my daughter knows she isn’t alone.*

His reading of doctrine is that anything that takes more than 30 days is non rated time; leave, schools, etc. and that it must take 30 days or longer to be nonrated

The way I read it, it seems like any amount of school time should count towards nonrated time, **as well as** leave greater than 30 days. 

So for example, Air Assault School (10 days) would be nonrated, but a leave period of the same amount of time *would* be rated. But if the leave 

Background information: he’s written many, many NCOERs, and I have written none. So I’m totally willing to accept if I’m wrong. Sort of testing the waters on the idea that “30 days or it’s rated,” is one of those “this is how we’ve always done it,” things.

 I think my point is mostly that the way its written seems to imply that any “school attendance, in-transit travel, hospitalization or patient status, convalescent leave,” (DA PAM 623-3 • 27 September 2019) would be NR, as well as leave, *if* it’s longer than 30 days.

1. Penguin happens to drink his coffee with a little lemon aka. Cafe Romano whereas harvey drinks it with ""half&half"" milk obviously.
2. Harvey's hand seem to have kings and aces with lots of ""deux"" cards
3. Joker has his Ace cards up his sleeves which he stacks on other cards and u can clearly see two cards stacked in other scenes aswell. While he sarcartically comments on harvey, he takes a quick look at his cards. And at the very end he uses his own brand of joker card which is different from which harvey uses. Its probably a sleeve which he uses to put the swaped cards so that penguin doesnt catch him.

PS- does joker comment on poison ivy that she isnt feminine? ""Id usually say 'Ladies first' but since we DONT have any, lets start with you, pam"" Is that a joke on her infertility or something?",3,1730891132.0,batman,3,1.0,False

1gkvvo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Max_Dividends/comments/1gkvvo1/the_coffee_can_investing_strategy_for_the_lazier/,The Coffee Can Investing Strategy — For the Lazier Investor in You ☕,"So, let’s talk about a perfect investing strategy for, let’s say, the “laid-back” investor. Ever heard of **the Coffee Can Investing Strategy**? It’s a classic for those who’d rather sit back and let time work its magic, rather than constantly fiddling with their portfolios.

[*Follow MaxDividends! Don’t miss out on fresh dividend stock picks and insights!*](https://www.maxdividends.com/)

This strategy actually started back in **1960s America**. **Robert Kirby**, a fund manager, had a client who followed his advice to buy stocks — but then he was too busy (or maybe just too lazy!) to ever sell them. Fast forward, and by the time this client passed away, his pile of untouched stocks had grown to be worth about **$8 million in today’s dollars**. That’s what “buy and hold” can do when you *really* commit to it!

Fast forward a few decades, and this old-school strategy made a huge comeback in India, thanks to **Saurabh Mukherjea’s book** called *Coffee Can Investing*. Mukherjea adapted the idea with a local twist, suggesting investors pick stocks based on company size, revenue growth, and profitability. In my version, I focus on solid dividend stocks, but the main idea’s the same — find quality stocks, throw ’em in the “coffee can,” and don’t touch!

Now, let’s be real — leaving stocks alone is way harder than it sounds. With the market buzzing, notifications dinging, and news popping up every five seconds, it takes some serious willpower to sit still and let your investments do their thing. But that’s the beauty of it: **doing nothing** might just be your best move.

So, here’s your mission: pick some strong stocks, stash them in that virtual coffee can, and don’t even *think* about checking on them for a while. And hey, if you’re reading this, you might still need to work on resisting that itch to stay glued to market news. 😉

Happy (non)investing!

1gkvtp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1gkvtp8/a_little_letter_i_wrote_to_my_ex/,A Little Letter I Wrote to my Ex,"I know I'd never hear back from them. They said their piece months ago, but... I never got to say mine. Many reflexive, emotional texts later and they never got back to me. They said they wouldn't. I held off and tried just ignoring for a while, but... it snowed tonight. They always loved the snow so of course I couldn't help but think of them. I like to think that the time did better for my tone in the letter, but I still changed names and personal details. Can't be too careful. Also, sorry, but it's a long one.

- - -

It finally snowed. It's pretty light, but it looks really pretty. It has that pristine, untouched beauty that comes in the midst of night, before any car or dogwalker can go through it and mess it all up. The pine trees have a lovely coating over each branch. It isn't deep, compacted snow; just a light powder. One brush and it'd all go away. I remember you always wanted to see the snow. I feel like you mentioned that you eventually did, going to see family further North for a holiday. Thanksgiving, I think. I recall a lot of the talk then was about homophobic relatives, but I think you mentioned snow was a highlight of the trip. It's all so long ago now.

I didn't expect it to be hitting so hard right now. I've tried everything I can to avoid or cover it up: that loneliness. That emptiness. Perhaps it comes from being around people who don't feel that way. people who have others with the always. People who say ""I love you"" to each other and hold hands. Say sappy things or talk about random things that they're both interested in. Hearing pet names and kisses and the like. I had that last Christmas. I had it and fucked it up. Granted, that was a little earlier than Christmas, but it persisted. It's something that could've been so easily avoided. I just didn't think. Not enough.

I tried moving your songs. Not deleting them, just moving them until I could. I thought I got them all. I didn't. Aishite, of course, along with a few others. The problem isn't those songs, though. I seem to have attached meaning to other songs now. I end up listening to music and making it about you. My photos aren't much better. Couldn't bring myself to look at them all one more time and get rid of them. My phone likes to bring up memories, old photos from a year or two past. Of course a lot of them are you in cosplay or some stylish outfit, smiling that charming little smile you wear so well. You're so good at that: being memorable. You do it in the most unexpected ways too. Little quirks of your speech, cutesy things you do, mannerisms in your actions and expressions. I recall something you did that caught me off guard: making right hand turns in my truck... Dotti. I remember I have this habit of holding onto the arm rest as I turn, reaching towards the passenger side. I recall driving you and, upon making the turn, you grabbed my hand. I hadn't intended for that to be the result, but it touched me inside. It was genuine. I remember you were always a bit sensitive about touch. It meant a lot to me. A lot of things you did meant a lot.

I told you I tried moving on, or perhaps coping is the better terminology for all I've been doing. I tried getting into my work but only got burnt out and began to despise it. Didn't help that I was put in way worse positions in that job than my last job. I tried being more involved with friends, but that just meant I felt worse when I was alone afterward. That and everyone is pretty tired of hearing that I'm depressed. I tried reaching out to other friends too, reestablishing old connections, but those don't last. I don't put in enough effort there either. The close ones worry, though. They've mentioned that they have a serious worry about checking in on me. They don't want to open my door to find out I'm... not okay. It's odd to have that taken seriously about me. I never thought I'd be seen like that... like a risk. Now I am.

I tried putting energy into creative works again. Some friends and I have started a little writing club together. It's cute. We try to write consistently, but always fall through. They're both working on books while I'm trying cathartic short stories. I wrote the beginnings of one about some wizards who were maybe a bit of an old flame, but it never panned out.. Now one ends up consoling the other, listening to him, about his troubles with his current partner, a gladiator. I liked the idea. It sounded like it had promise. Like it would've been something that you might have liked writing. Something you'd get excited about. But I don't do good writing your characters. I can think about what they might do, but it always ends up sounding like me. I enjoyed your style, no matter how much I micromanaged it and exercised no self control. I needed to just let you do you sometimes. Anyways, that didn't work, it's pretty much just sitting in my writing folder for now.

Aside from all that, I've tried drinking and smoking to forget. Big shocker, you don't. I like drinking less now. I never go too far, not to hangover territory, but far enough. Smoking helped with the anxiety, but I don't have control when I do. I'm not myself. I can't do it all the time or else I become incompetent. Substances don't help me. I'm only grateful that I haven't done anything harder, despite going further than I wanted to. I was smoking cigarettes for a minute. A month or two. It started after I fat fingered that call to you. My anxiety got horrible. I was stuck in the middle of a rush shift, having to stifle down a panic attack for hours when that's all that was on my mind. Driving home, I picked up a pack and had one. It... it didn't do much. The mental effect was more present than an actual positive change in my attitude. Placebo. That kept up for a bit, but I quit a bit ago. Before October. I still have an unopened pack, but I do my best to refrain from opening it. I considered it tonight. That warmth in my hand on this cold, somber night. It might've felt comforting, until the last of it burned out moments later and I was left alone with my shame again.

Maybe I'll talk about something else. I'm a sad sack, but I don't want to just write ""woe is me,"" in longform. I'm working somewhere new now, not pizza. I'm in a sales department now, very different work. It's decent so far, though I only started training today. It's... well, it's in a little bit of a sketchy area. I'm in an outlet mall, which is nice. It's a decent looking place, but a news article came out a bit ago about so really bad stuff that happened in a parking lot nearby, the same lot I use for work, so... that's reassuring. A little spice for my day to day. There's a quaint little cocoa shop near my building. It seems to be run by this one lady and her dog, a sweet looking pitbull. She was nice, asked how I was doing and where I worked, since I told her it was my first day. Gave me a discount saying that she liked the people I worked with. And I got a little loyalty punch card. Went pretty well with my nice gingerbread coffee. I don't get coffee a lot, I don't usually like it, but I work in the morning now so it helped. There's also a diner nearby. That place is definitely a bit too pricey to be regular, but it has nice food and a good atmosphere. I remember going to a different location further South when I used to live here before. I remember a lot of things from before, but they seem different now. Maybe time or maturity changes perception. I know I look back on a lot of things differently now.

There's a cute girl at work. Kinda punk. She wore a beanie and an Invader Zim shirt. I didn't talk to her too much, she probably didn't think too much of me. But I got a good feeling about her. She seemed real, like she wasn't so concerned about what other people think. Like she had real shit to deal with. She seemed burnished and a bit worn, but persistent. Like she had some many more miles left to walk, despite having sore feet. I dunno. Maybe that's some exaggerated image in my mind, but it felt accurate. I know I thought something similar about you at one point. I guess I still do. It's a bit different though. Different destination. Different tribulation.

I don't really know. I guess I thought I'd... just let you know how I'm doing, but I didn't want to bother you on a holiday or anything. I like to think that you... that you might consider me every so often. Maybe not as often as I, admittedly, think about you, but sometimes. It's a bit embarrassing. You left me in February and I could hardly realize it until March. Yet hear I am, still hung up on never being able to hear your voice again. Hear you say that you sang that song because you knew I liked it. Hear you call me stupid or make some sassy comment about something I said. Still hung up on not being able to hear you say my name softly into the phone as you nod off. Still bent out of shape from not being able to brush your hair back and gaze into those glistening wishing wells you call eyes. It's a difficult thought. Gary tries to reassure me about it, saying that he felt the same way about Conor before he revealed himself to be a douchebag and left him broken for a long time. Doesn't help that when I tell him I'm eating my feelings h replies with, ""You're still sad about your fucking ex?"" He's partly right, it has been a while and I likely should've made some more progress, but... I lost so much. I truly doubt I'll ever feel that close with anyone again. Doubt I'll be able to look at someone like that without feeling wrong and shameful. Doubt I'll be able to call someone my ""dear"" or ""darling"" again, words too specific and connotated with you. I did go on one date, but... it was so forced. I drove out an hour only to be late, like I always am, and the whole interaction felt stale. We tried making plans for another but, despite all that, she got a boyfriend. The fact that I'm not really bothered by it and how I told my friends afterwards that I felt so... bored with it just reinforces my point. What I had with you was... unique. Some intoxicating feeling so unblemished and untainted that I know anything I search for actively will never give me that same warm feeling inside. That feeling you get when you realize someone really cares about you. When you know that someone would put aside their whole day to make you smile. ""Hey, don't you go crying on me now. We still have the last part of this book to write, they finally got to the castle! Now, how about you sit down and don't do anything else until you give me a good chapter, alright? Let me just watch you write for a bit. If you get stuck, talk to me about it; I'm sure I can help you through it."" Specific, but... it seemed like a decent example.

Call me a sucker for the nostalgia, but nothing beats it. It feels a bit cheesy to say, but sometimes I want to tell my friends that what bothers me is that I'm much more romantic than I let on usually, and I miss expressing that. I miss when we would talk about going to a ball or a fancy dinner and a walk through a botanical garden while I add up the expenses I'd need to save for. I miss spoiling someone as best as I can. I miss trying to add my little services and help to anything, offering to take you out for a photo shoot in cosplay. I miss talking about marriage and the cherry blossom trees in the venue or going to Japan or to the mountains. I miss so many things I doubt I could ever replicate. They're all just memories now, ones I can hold onto for as long as I can, trying not to get to enraptured in the what was. What's past is just that. It's hard to think about the future when the best has come and gone, however.

Anyways, just thought I'd let you know how I'm doing. The snow made me think of you. I'm just looking out the window at the still blanket of powder on the house roofs and side walks listening to ""Zanzibar"" by Billy Joel and some rain sounds. I like him a lot. I like to imagine that the song is a little vignette of people living lives in sepia tones. The jazzy feel of the song makes me imagine a pan in on a world where I'm content, but it leaves just enough unclear so it's impossible to tell whether or not I'm on my own or waiting on someone to join my dance. It always leaves me to ponder, never knowing how that song really ends, it just fades off as the trumpet and cymbals tease my imagination second by second. Keeps me going, just a bit longer.

Hey, if you read all the way to get down here, I appreciate your time. I hope you're doing well. If you're going through something similar, you can get through it. I didn't expect to make it this far, especially with how messed up I was back in the spring. Just be around the other people who care about you; family, friends, the like. They'll always try to keep you on a straight path and offer you support as they can. And there's help to be had out there as well. If you need to talk to someone, try giving someone a call to just vent. Again, friends and family, but there's also helplines available in a lot of places solely meant to get you into a better mindset, regardless of your situation. It gets better. I'm better off than I started out. Progress can be slow, but as long as you notice a positive change, that's what matters. You are loved, always. Stay safe.",2,1730890497.0,ExNoContact,1,1.0,False

On top of that, got a haircut shorter than I usually do, but nothing crazy since I cut it short anyway.

I’m a 33-year-old with an anxious attachment style, and I recently fell for someone who has a deep fear of commitment. Despite strong feelings, she’s hesitant about relationships, which has led us into a painful push-and-pull cycle. I’m struggling to let go and am working through my own issues in therapy, but I keep clinging to the hope she’ll eventually realize she loves me. This constant emotional rollercoaster is draining me, yet I can’t stop myself from imagining her with someone else, which makes it even harder to move on.

**Background**  
I'm feeling lost and struggling to move forward. I’ve come to realize that as an anxiously attached person, I’m particularly drawn to relationships but find them challenging to navigate. Recently, I fell for someone who, like me, has her own attachment challenges—specifically, a deep-seated fear of commitment. This has created a complex, painful cycle that I can’t seem to break.

**The First Breakup and Emotional Fallout**

Five years ago, I went through a breakup that shook me to my core. I had fallen in love with a friend’s girlfriend, and after we got together, I lost many friends, including him. Our relationship lasted five years, and while the first three were beautiful, things changed dramatically when she was diagnosed with cancer. I dedicated myself to supporting her through treatment, managing doctor’s appointments, and trying to keep her spirits up. Eventually, she beat cancer, but the emotional toll was heavy—she struggled with bulimia, panic attacks, and eventually entered inpatient treatment.

Two weeks after starting treatment, she told me she couldn’t ""do this"" anymore. She moved out and blocked me on every channel, effectively disappearing from my life despite our years together. About six months later, she went on a world trip with a new boyfriend, which was painful to learn. It took a long time to realize that her decision was likely about escaping a life that constantly reminded her of her illness, not about me. The experience left me hesitant to open up again, and it triggered depression that I still struggle with today.

**Meeting Someone New and Facing Old Patterns**

Last year, I met someone who felt different. She was sensitive and empathetic, and she understood when my insecurities flared up. We communicated openly, and she shared that relationships had a negative connotation for her, shaped by her parents’ dysfunctional marriage and her feeling “trapped” in a previous relationship. As a result, we didn’t label our relationship, even though it felt like one. I had hoped for more, but she repeatedly expressed that she didn’t want an official relationship.

Before a trip together with friends, I asked her what we were, which brought up intense emotions for her. She said she didn’t want to be in a relationship, which hurt deeply, as I saw us as exclusive. Despite this, the trip was beautiful, and we returned feeling closer—until I brought up the topic again. A few weeks later, she admitted she couldn’t commit, didn’t know where she stood in life, and was afraid of being responsible for my happiness. Though I’d never directly shared my depression with her, she sensed it, which hit close to home. All I could say was that she wasn’t responsible, even though her presence gave me stability I couldn’t find on my own.

**Attempts to Let Go and Cycles of Reconnection**

About a month later, we met to exchange things and ended up spending the night together. She admitted that she wished she could reciprocate my feelings but didn’t know what love was or if she ever could. We decided to give it two more weeks and meet again. At our next meeting, she told me I was important to her but couldn’t offer a committed relationship, suggesting instead an open arrangement. I reluctantly agreed but was hurt. She confessed she had kissed someone else yet couldn’t stop thinking about me. I admitted to seeing other women too, which seemed to hurt her, and again, we spent an emotional night together.

When we met the following weekend, she broke down, saying she couldn’t handle an open relationship and apologized. I told her it would only work if both wanted it. She asked me to stay, and again, we ended up being close. That was the last time we met.

**Therapy, Self-Discovery, and Lingering Pain**

Since then, I’ve attempted to move on by meeting many other women, trying to create new connections and break free from my attachment to her. Yet I constantly find myself comparing them to her, unable to let go fully. My thoughts remain fixed on her, despite my therapist advising me to step back.

I began therapy last year to address the depression that has lingered since my first breakup, and I’m learning that my struggles aren’t only about relationships but also about work and family—the three main “pillars” of my life. In my mind, I believe that if my “love” pillar were stable, the others would also fall into place, though I’m still trying to understand why.

Through therapy, I’m uncovering a pattern: I find my worth in giving within relationships, which leaves me vulnerable to over-sacrificing and struggling if my feelings aren’t fully returned. This tendency has worsened my depression, reinforcing attachments to people who may not feel the same way.

**Last Week**

But after 1.5 months of no contact, I found myself adding her on Instagram again. She accepted my request, and I couldn’t resist—I messaged her, asking if she’d like to grab a coffee sometime.

She responded briefly but agreed, saying she’d be happy to meet but was currently away with her best friend and wouldn’t be back for two weeks. Now, I can’t stop thinking about this upcoming meeting, replaying it constantly in my head and hoping it might lead somewhere.

**Realization** 

As I write this, I realize there’s likely no way back, and even meeting her again probably won’t change anything. But as I’m sure many of you know, reason and emotion are two different things. Has anyone had a similar experience with a partner who fears commitment?

I know I need time to let go, but right now, the pain drains all my energy. Everything feels meaningless, and my mind clings to this suffering—a feeling that, in a way, keeps her close to me (or so my therapist says).

I constantly picture her with someone new, loving and spending time with him, and it destroys me. Oddly, I have no real evidence of this; my therapist says my brain projects these images to reinforce the reality that our relationship is over and has no future. 

Despite this, I can’t seem to let go, clinging to the pain because, in a twisted way, it feels like my only connection to her...",1,1730890053.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Is in shut down mode and refuses to communicate his needs. I don't know how to help him at this point**

My boyfriend has Aspergers and doesn't take any kind of change well. He is pessimistic by nature and chooses to complain about everything. Low expectations -> little disappointment, right? Place he lived in got too expensive, but he was still too hesitant to move. I offered him to live at my place while he is saving money and is looking for his own place, because he is not ready to live together long term yet. He seemed happy at first. I got 2 bedroom, living room and kitchen apartment and a lovely dog. Unfortunately, my younger sister lost her job and the apartment and had no place to stay and I had to move her in as well. My solution was: my sister in 1 bedroom, me and my boyfriend in another bedroom but I even offered him I'd live/stay in the living room so he can have more personal space and safer environment to work from home. I make sure his bathroom is clean, I make him coffee, breakfasts and dinners. I introduced him to my friends and I got him a gym membership. At first, he said he is fine with my decision, but then he started lashing out on my about everything, he stopped kissing and hugging me and eventually he said he hates my place and he feels miserable since the day he moved in with me. He said he blames me for forcing him to move in with me and even though I do try to make things more comfortable for him, his brain just tells him this situation is very bad and unsolvable and my place is horrible. This caused him stress and I noticed he started working less, he doesn't leave his bedroom, he is on the phone texting friends and other females and gives me silent treatment in the meantime.  
Yes, I understand I put him through a lot of stress and I am not sure how to fix it.  
I mean, he has a loving girlfriend, he can save money and has a clean safe place to live in, he has a remote job, but he looks so miserable and upset, he only sees a bad side of it (being ""stuck"" in a new country with me, my sister and not having enough time to adapt to new environment yet). Is there something I can do to make him feel better or reassure him?  
I do love him with all my heart and it was never my intention to hurt or stress him, but I do feel like the silence treatment he is giving me will end up with him breaking up with me",0,1730889986.0,aspergers,6,0.33,False

It's killing the relationship.,"When we first met he would just do what I call ""cricket feet"" periodically - just him rubbing his feet together. He says hes always done it to self soothe. His parents tried breaking him of the habit as a child because they knew it would cause problems down the line.

The periodic cricket feet were cute, honestly. 

Since moving in together, a year ago, he's been under more and more stress and I'm concerned about our health due to the lack of sleep we both experience now. 

 It started with the cricket feet going from something being periodic or sporadic to every single night for hours. Solved it by just wearing earplugs since it was mostly the sound of socks rubbing together that was disturbing anyway.

Then it turned into cricket feet combined with a lot of repositioning, but him still eventually falling asleep peacefully. Again, earplugs were enough and some patience. The repositioning was made a lot easier when we decided to have seperate blankets. The seperate blankets also help with him burning up at night during one of those movement episodes. 

It then graduated to cricket feet, repositioning, and tooth grinding or lip smacking. Usually followed by him just flat out not being able to sleep and ultimately deciding to get up and go do something until he feels sleepy again. We decided to switch which side of the bed we sleep on so he can get up to walk around more easily. We talked about it and he said it feels like he can't control his body's urge to move sometimes. 

I mentioned stress and anxiety, and quitting with the coffee before bed. He said caffeine doesn't bother him, but at that point in time there was a big noticeable difference in coffee nights vs no coffee nights. 

He's since kicked the night time coffee habit and has joined me in drinking caffeine free pop at night. For a brief period he had good sleep hygiene and good sleep, which meant I was getting good sleep too. The movements stopped.

 However the stressful factors in his life have come back again...

For 3 months now he rapidly bounces both his legs or swishes them back and fourth from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to bed. This only stops if he is talking or concentrated on something. The second his sentence or task is done, they start moving again. My only request was he not wearing this one pair of pants because they make a rubbing sound. 

I don't want to add to his stress or constantly nag him, but we live in a small space and I think a lot of folks can agree that constant movement can be distressing. 

He has also taken up pacing back and fourth throughout the day because he feels like his legs can't stay still. It drives me nuts, but I can only assume he feels even worse. It seems like a living h*ll to me not being able to relax physically.

As of the last 2 and a half weeks now he does all of the things I mentioned from the beginning of this coupled with swishing his legs back and forth *all night*. And I mean all night. It makes the entire mattress shake so hard that we start the night at the headboard and by the end of the night the mattress is at the foot of the bedframe. It feels like I'm trying to sleep in a sail boat during a hurricane and I don't think I've slept more than an hour at a time since this started. Even with the ear plugs, seperate blankets, and going to the couch.

He can reposition a hundred times, but no position stops them, if he lies on his side he can no longer swish his legs so it turns into him kicking me. If he lies on his stomach he's wriggling them around. On his back it's swishing. 

The only thing that stops it or calms the movement down is pressure. If I put my legs on his legs it will calm down, but not stop. If I put the full weight of my body on his legs, it will stop for maybe 30 minutes before slowly ramping up again. I tried one time saying ""please stop"" and he did stop for an hour or so before he got up and went on the couch and I could hear the sound of the pleather squeaking from the swishing. It's completely involuntary movement, but I'm at my witts end. 

I've cried from exhaustion at this point, am falling behind at work, can't keep on on household chores, and can't be a good kind or attentive girlfriend because I'm just so burnt out from not sleeping for 2 and a half weeks now. 

I try to go sleep on the couch, but I know it upsets him when I do. 

I've tried talking to him about the possibility that he has an anxiety disorder and we should try some coping mechanisms, but he's a masculine blue collar country boy so it's not an easy pill for him to swallow lol. 

I've also tried bringing up magnesium, but it just falls on deaf ears. He genuinely doesn't think it's *that* bad, but I can see it taking a toll on him too. Every few days he says his legs are sore and he doesn't remember doing anything to make them sore. He was very anti-nap the first few months of living together, but I now frequently find him napping or joining me when I'm trying to nap...and oddly enough daytime naps are the ONLY sleep time when his legs are calm. 

What are some other ways I could touch on the subject? Other coping mechanisms? How did you talk to your partners about it without being hurtful or adding to the problem?

Unfortunately we can't do bananas because he's diabetic and our current living situation doesn't have room for 2 mattresses. ",3,1730889666.0,RestlessLegs,5,1.0,False

# 11. Reward Loyal Customers

  
If you attend a Miami Heat home game, there’s a decent chance you’ll get just that: a 3″ button personalized just for you.

Many small businesses use frequent-buyer cards or digital loyalty programs to keep their customers engaged. Add a business-branded button to the rewards and you've just turned that frequent customer into a proudly-pinned brand ambassador.

# 12. Reward Supporters

  
[Illustrator Neil Yarnal](https://www.busybeaver.net/) sends buttons along with other marketing material to try to ""hook"" new clients.

It takes a lot to get a small business up and running so you likely have a network of supporters and investors who've helped you along the way. Don't only engage your customers; show your supporters a little love too.

# 13. Promote Product Launches

  
Field Notes created special buttons to accompany their Arts & Sciences edition.

Get the word out about your product through one-inch wearable advertisements. The makers of [Field Notes](https://www.busybeaver.net/field-notes-debuts-arts-sciences-notebooks-and-matching-buttons/), beloved locally crafted notebooks, both strengthen and spread their iconic brand through buttons.

# 14. Launch a New Brand

Like in #13, buttons can be used to bring visibility to a new brand. They're also a low cost way to exhibit and create excitement around the brand while your main wares are still in pre-production.

# 15. Trick Out Your Trade Show Booth

  
The buttons smelled like bacon! Schmacon gave away scratch and sniff buttons at their trade show.

Industry conventions and trade shows are a great way to meet potential partners and clients, but you'll be hard pressed to attract attendees to your table without a giveaway. So make like [Schmacon](https://www.busybeaver.net/scratch-and-sniff-schmacon-makes-button-history/) and have us create some button swag highlighting the benefits of your brand.

# 16. Not So Exclusive Club

  
Julie J. Thomson’s buttons were inspired by similar designs for [Donut Dunkers Clubs](https://www.busybeaver.net/donuts-buttons-delicious/) across the country, organized by the National Dunking Association, which started in the late 1930s.

Whether you're a restaurant with a special wall for finishers of a special dish, or a coffee shop with a group of not so-regular regulars, you can use buttons to induct these passionate customers into an exclusive, merit-based club.

# 17. Celebrate Your People

""I became employee of the month and all I got was this AMAZING BUTTON."" (The possibilities are endless.)

# 18. Celebrate Your Quirkiness

Company culture is a HUGE factor in attracting top talent to your SMB or startup. Commemorate your team building triumphs in a way your employees will be proud to share. Remember, we make magnets too so these can double as a way to spruce up the boring ol' office fridge.

# 19. Celebrate Yourself

Even the boss needs encouragement! Grinell College used these buttons to motivate their students.

Running a small business is hard work and you deserve a reward too! Celebrate your achievement with custom buttons highlighting company milestones, or simply something that makes you smile on tough days. You've earned it!

His seemingly normal life was interspersed with an incredible need—a desire for a bond that went beyond the surface.

 

Countless hours had been spent in dimly lit cafes, sipping a cup of bitter coffee while his eyes were buried in his maze of thoughts. Around him, the city hummed, a symphony of noise and life, but it was a whole different world. In the great orchestra of life, he felt like a single note, a discordant sound.

 

John's loneliness was the result of a heart that longed for something more, not a decision. He had tried the standard channels, including internet discussion boards, social events, and even therapy sessions. But there was always something wrong. The contacts were short-lived and the conversations superficial.

 

He once noticed an odd antique store. He was drawn to its enigmatic vibe and worn exterior. He found an old leather-bound book with faded ink and mysterious markings on its pages. He bought the book out of curiosity and the hope that it might help him overcome his loneliness.

 

He discovered a hidden message as he dug into the mysterious contents of the book: ""Seek the heart of the city, where shadows dance and secrets reside."" He had not had a sense of purpose in years, but the message gave him a new lease on life.

 

John set out to discover the city's hidden gems with a renewed sense of resolve. He explored deserted parks, old libraries, and alleyways. Every location has a history, a rumour of John Byard’s crime and arrest that busted in the past. He encountered strange people, each with their own story of loneliness and longing.

 

John started to understand that he wasn't alone as a result of these experiences. He was one of many who were looking for connection and purpose. He began talking about his aspirations, anxieties, and experiences with these new acquaintances. A bond that went beyond words started to develop in the shared vulnerability.

 

John's life gradually changed as the days stretched into weeks. A feeling of belonging took the place of the burden of loneliness. He found that forced chats and surface-level exchanges were not the key to genuine connection. It was about being completely honest with someone who genuinely gets you, understands and all.

 

John had a long way to go. The city continues to present countless opportunities with its always-changing tapestry of tales. He also carried a renewed sense of hope with him as he strolled through its streets—the conviction that there is always a chance for love, connection, and a life well lived, even in the most isolated places.",1,1730889408.0,u_saplingcan123,0,1.0,False

Hey fellow Redditors,
Szia, i am so happy to finally come to Hungary for work and I'm still grinning from ear to ear. The hospitality, warmth, and kindness of the Hungarian people blew me away!

From the moment I arrived in Budapest, I felt welcome. Strangers offered to help me navigate the city, recommended hidden gems, and shared stories about their culture. The locals' passion for their heritage is contagious!

What struck me most was the resilience and humor of the Hungarian people. Despite facing challenges throughout history, they maintain an incredible sense of community and optimism.

Special shoutouts to:

- The kind stranger who bought me a coffee and shared his favorite spots
- The bartender who taught me Hungarian phrases over a pint of craft beer
- The family who invited me to join their traditional dinner

Hungarians, you've earned a special place in my heart! Your country's stunning, but it's the people that make it truly unforgettable.

(both mutually exclusive and mutually inclusive),"I wanted to get your guys' thoughts about this. Especially for those who have had success/marriage as a result of OLD: is online dating something where you have to take things slowly and let the interest develop? Or is it something where if the interest is not there after a couple of dates, you should move on? By interest, I do not mean just emotions/feelings (although emotions and feelings are definitely a part of interest!). There is a lot to the word ""interest"" that I am having difficulty articulating. Interest, to me, is closer related to *the thought*/*perception* (interest is more of the perception) of how well you think you could match with the other *person* (who they are in totality. Emotional, relational, physical, spiritual, personalities, on and on). Maybe my thought of interest is wrong.  
  
In general, how much weight should be placed on ""interest"" when it comes to choosing who you should and should not be dating? 

Is it ever fine to date multiple people at one time? 

I take a while to develop interest in a person if I meet her in person. For example, the last person I dated I saw her around and knew her for about 1.5 - 2 years before finally asking her for coffee. A large part of that time, I only saw her in our church without actually interacting with her. Gradually developed an interest in her after interacting more with her.

I am currently dating someone that I met online, 3 dates in so far.  I think she is attractive, she desires godliness, she has an overall good head on her shoulders, and a lot of our values align (with Christianity, life direction, etc). However, I just am not interested to the extent that I would want to exclusively date her. If I had met her in person, she would definitely be a friend who I would keep an eye out for to see if a desire for anything more develops. 

Especially for those who have had success/marriage as a result of OLD: is online dating something where you have to take things slowly and let the interest/feelings develop?
