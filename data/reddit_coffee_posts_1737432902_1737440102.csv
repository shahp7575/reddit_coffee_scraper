1i6c8cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1i6c8cr/flirting_with_a_coworker/,Flirting with a Coworker,"Good Evening. I wanted to ask for advice for this situation I got myself in. I started working a new job and one of my coworkers and I got really close quickly. We got each other’s number. He invited me to their gaming discord. Invited me to their climbing group. Also invited me to his D&D club which I got super invested in and loved. We texted pretty much every day about anything. Sometimes asking each other questions about random things. We talked of our sexualities and our past relationships. Well, I ended up becoming interested in him romantically. I asked him out to coffee which he misunderstood as a friend hang out. I clarified this with him which he declined a date because he didn’t want to date a coworker. He assured me he still wanted to 100% be friends still and still go out to coffee as friends. 

We continued talking and, one night our conversation got a bit more flirty. We spoke of more personal topics, like sex and who we find attractive. I asked him if he would ever do FWB instead which he said he’s not much the type. Our conversation got more personal and he said I shouldn’t be embarrassed about speaking about such things because I was. He said I had nothing to worry because he was pretty sex positive. I got a bit raunchy and said something inappropriate. It was late; probably shouldn’t have said that. I was being playful and said I had various piercings and that I’d sleep with him. Immediately he shut me down and said he’d prefer not speaking like this between the two of us. Which I respected / didn’t further push. Next day he tells me he’d rather we no longer be friends and strictly remain professional because he felt uncomfortable now. I was a bit hurt by this as I really enjoyed our D&D group. I told him I’d like to have some space myself. That I was genuinely into him and didn’t mean to be malicious by this. I apologized embarrassingly because I felt super bad for him being so uncomfortable now. I respected his need for space and didn’t further text him. Over the weekend, I sent him a text asking if we could talk. Today I get a phone call from my manager saying I’ve been temporarily suspended due to a workplace investigation. 

I know, flirting with a coworker is bad news but I really liked this guy. Sure, I pushed the boundary but getting work involved? Should I be worried for my job now? Btw I didn’t interact with him at work since that night since we worked in different areas / plus it was awkward at that point. I just felt embarrassed and I knew he felt uncomfortable.

1i6c6ue,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1i6c6ue/vyvanse_50mg_too_high_of_a_dose_for_me/,Vyvanse 50mg - too high of a dose for me? ,"I started on Vyvanse 30mg but felt that the effects worse off around 3pm. I didn’t really experience a crash and my ADHD symptoms would return at full force in the evening (assuming this was a result of dopamine and norepinephrine levels returning to baseline). My doctor prescribed Vyvanse because I work office hours and need to do study when I get home. But I found that the Vyvanse wasn’t lasting the whole day. I still had a lot of energy when I got home but would waste that on watching YouTube videos - my main hyperfixation. For years, I’ve been telling myself “oh let me just watch this YouTube video and then I’ll study” and this repeats for hours because I don’t have a normal perception of time. I found that the Vyvanse definitely helped with executive function and initiating tasks, just wasn’t lasting the whole day. 

My doctor then increased my prescription to 50mg, which I’ve been taking for a few months now. I did suggest boosters because a lot of ADHD people seem to take boosters later in the day. But my doctor wanted to try different doses to see if there was an optimal dose for me before prescribing any boosters. 

Initially, I didn’t notice a huge difference when I went up to 50mg but I thought maybe it would take some time to become really effective. I tried changing variables to ascertain what makes the Vyvanse more effective for me because I know everyone’s body behaves differently - i.e. taking it different times in the morning, taking it on an empty stomach then having breakfast versus the other way around (obv not all at once, I was trying something different every other week to see if there was difference in its effectiveness). 

I took a few weeks off Vyvanse during the holidays because I didn’t really need to take them. So I don’t think I have built a tolerance. But since being back on them, the negatives far outweigh the positives. I have booked in to see my doctor soon. I just wanted to see if anyone else had a similar experience on different doses, and whether it’s worth switching to short acting meds or maybe going down to 40mg?

The crash I experienced before the long break wasn’t so bad, but now the crash is like crippling. It happens around 2-3pm, my body becomes super sore with all my muscles aching, I have absolutely no energy, I feel really fatigued, agitated, anxious and depressed. I know I’m not actually depressed because I’m pretty happy on the days when I’m not taking the meds but this kind of depression is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before. I just feel so shitty and so sleepy. I wasn’t drinking coffee whilst taking the Vyvanse before (as it’s also a stimulant) but I’ve been needing to drink 2 cups of coffee just to get through the day until 5pm to deal with the sleepiness. When I get home, I’m so exhausted I want to nap. If I do nap, it’s like light sleep for an hour or so because the Vyvanse is still in my system. It’s such a weird feeling - being so exhausted but my brain not allowing me to really sleep. The downside to a nap is that it’s so much harder to actually sleep at night. I was given sleeping pills which I was taking regularly on Vyvanse but now they seem to do nothing. I’ve been going to bed at 9pm every night but can’t sleep fall asleep until 1 or 2am and have very little deep sleep/REM. I’ve always had sleep problems - I’m naturally nocturnal, I have more energy at night time so I struggle to fall asleep really early but I sleep very deeply and struggle to wake up early. Before I was prescribed sleeping pills, brown noise or rain sounds usually helped me fall asleep and improved the quality of sleep. But this doesn’t seem to be working for me anymore either. I take the Vyvanse around 7:30-8am every morning but I think the coffees might be making it more difficult for me to fall asleep - but I also just cannot function without the coffees because the crash is so horrible and I need something to keep me going until I finish work. 

For context, I work as a paralegal. I love my job and enjoy the work that I do and I love my team as they are very supportive and understanding of my ADHD issues. I’m also studying to be a lawyer which has been my one and only dream. It’s just that my inattentive ADHD symptoms make it so difficult for me to keep up with university (even when I didn’t have a job). I’m saying this because I feel like someone’s going to comment to say “maybe you’re not built for office hours” or “maybe you’re putting too much pressure on yourself” or something similar. I’ve seen that on other ADHD threads and it’s so disheartening to read that. Because I feel like that’s a different way of saying “you’re not good enough to do this kind of work because you have ADHD”. I understand that there are structural and functional differences in my brain compared to neurotypical people. Even though I struggled immensely, I put in a lot of effort and determination to into a law degree and land this job, both before an official diagnosis. I also work with people who have ADHD and they are some of the smartest and most organised people I have ever met (and one of them isn’t even medicated which is wild). There are also heaps of students who work and study full time, including people with ADHD. So it’s definitely doable, it’s just that I’ve only been recently diagnosed with ADHD so I’m still trying to figure out how I can minimise my ADHD symptoms enough to function productively. 

Sorry for waffling! I tend to do that lol. But anyways, feel free to share your experiences if you want to. I like hearing about other peoples ADHD journeys, it makes me feel less alone I guess. ",1,1737439701.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

[I box contains 7 easy to tear-open packets \(would be nice if there was 10\)](https://preview.redd.it/0ruj6bzbdaee1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e8d6b7cbb2c9d536ef7bb4b4ef2f12b5465a977)

I usually get a good lookover of most products that Trader Joe's makes. And I hadn't seen this one before, even though it has been a TJ's branded product for over 4 years. Maybe at my store they changed its location? It was over by the tea & coffee. It's $2.99 in the store. For just 7 packets... that seems a bit high. But then I've seen online sellers charge a lot more. But really... $0.43 per packet isn't bad for what you get.

The directions recommend 12 ounces of water, hot or cold.... and that's it. I decided to try it hot. It does blend quite quickly. No lingering clumping. And you can smell the sharpness of ginger coming off of it in the steam. It's potent! And it's a bit raw as-is, so I decided to hit it with just 3 tiny drops of monk fruit sweetener. That takes the edge off, without turning it into a sweet drink.

I have to say, if I was feeling ill, this would be like a warm hug. I just felt like I was sipping something very healthful and medicinal. I love ginger in general. When I have sushi or sashimi, I'll down all of the sliced ginger by the end of the meal. When I make masala chai, I'll put in fresh slices of ginger. And I enjoy ginger candies (hard & soft). This ""Ginger Juice Mix"" sure tastes like authentic ginger to me. And not only is there no added sugar, there's no added coloring either. The color is... well... not very pretty. It looks almost like clogged sink water. But hey, ginger has never gotten awards for how it looks. It's all about taste.

It's a little weird calling it ""juice."" It's a cloudy concoction, but not quite the thickness of a juice, yet... not as thin as a regular tinted color tea. Latte maybe?

Some people have taken to adding this to lemonade, or using brewed tea as a base.

Anyway, there has been a number of posts about this before.

So I  (F31) started dating this guy about 2 and a half weeks ago (M34).  We've been on 3 dates. They were all great. I feel comfortable w him and he is just my speed. We have fun little dates. Nothing fancy but still that's what I prefer.  I know we are very early in our relationship and apparently men lose interest after 3 months so maybe I just need to wait longer to see who he really is?

 He's cute, likes video games like I do, funny, seems understanding, Very sweet and considerate, he's optimistic and just seems like a beam of sunshine. He works in the medical field (not a nurse or NA), he's honest, texts me constantly, we text about interesting stuff, he streams his gameplay on discord and I watch what he plays while we talk. I fall asleep texting him and wake up to a good morning text. He's sends me screenshots of the characters in his games (he's literally texting me about them as I type this). I send him photos of my hobbies I do and he's always engaging..He gives me princess treatment like opening doors and and has picked up coffee for us a few times before dates. He gave me a specific type of chocolate I mentioned liking you in the past on our first date. He's just so kind so far and I've never met a guy who didn't want to sleep w me the moment they glance at me (I'm not trying to brag but I'm an attractive gal) so I've always been pursued for that reason only.

We haven't even held hands yet. I like him so much, and I want to go slow b/c I'm VERY inexperienced. It all seems way to good to be true, especially after how long it's been for me when it comes to relationships. I haven't dated in almost 10 years and just decided to Nov 2023. He used to be married and has been divorced for 2 years. He talked about the pain of it all and the  therapy he went through for it and the whole time I couldn't help but think about how much I wanted to kiss him. He told me she cheated on him with one of his guy friends (oof!)

Is this guy being genuine? It feels very real but I'm afraid I'm being love bombed and I'm too naive and inexperienced to know the difference??

Recently he broke up, so we had decided we will call it off sooner or later since we dont have a future together. We had decided to call off in April, so that we get enough time with each other, but since past few months i have seen change in behaviour of him. I had seen he had accepted the fact ki we are going to breakup and with every fight and disagreement he insisted on breakup. And finally here we are we had breakup. I feel he had already accepted it and processed it but i cant. I knew it already yes, but until you dont experience it how do you process it. 

Why we dont have future:
1) His family is super orthodox and i dont want to stay with em, they want me to do the pura ghar ka kaam and wear salwar kameez etc. 
so typical orthodox thinking.

2) The finances dont match, like there is a difference between what kind of living i am used to and what he has to offer.

I was still little positive ki dekh lenge etc etc, now he is like i wanna get married its my age. We should call it off, none of the above two things are getting any better. And he ended it. 

Now, i miss him alot.

I ll have no one to pick or see me at station.
No one to come home to or no one bhai comes at my place now. It ll be so alone and dull.
I ll miss him sending and getting me food and coffee.

I will miss gng outt on weeekends with him and him staying over re.

I ll miss all the cafe dates and mumbai darshan 🥲

I ll miss having to rant and fight with someone.

I ll miss gng on drive or ride with him and him picking me up

I ll miss him kaafi 

I dont know how to move on, i feel i had gotten the best now its difficult to get someone like him. Plus i stay away from family and i feel very lonely i barely have friends. Also he might be engaged with someoe 4-5 months down the line. 

How do i just try to move on?

For example, he's very comfortable with leaving used cups / forks / spoons / coffee cups / general trash  around our shared space that we both pay 50/50 for.  I wouldn't have an issue with it if he cleaned or picked up after himself, but after 2+ years of living together and me consistently picking up after him and cleaning whatever he used, I'm starting to get really tired of it.  He usually has guests over for one reason or another, and I think he's a gracious host, however, being the gracious host that he is, he usually serves tea to his guests.

This is the source of one of the problems.

He does not clean up after his guests, nor himself.  He leaves the cups that he used to sit there and get moldy.  He does not feel the need to clean them either.  Usually, I end up noticing and (as always) end up cleaning these moldy cups that I haven't used myself.

I've brought this up many times during the 2+ years that we have been living together.  It has been an ongoing issue that seems to have no resolution.  I am very tired of it.

My reason for writing all of this tonight is because I was using the kitchen earlier in the day.  Long story short, I was peeling potatoes as one does, and made sure that the sink was clear of potato skins.  I chucked the skins into the trash like a normal person.

Then a bit later, boyfriend was cleaning out his teapot and left the tea leaves in the sink, clogging the drain.  I couldn't help but get a bit upset because we've had issues with our kitchen sink being clogged for a good 6 + months beforehand.  Naturally, we had a fight about it, and to be honest I'm still rather upset.  He does nothing around the house- he doesn't feel the need to take out the trash, doesn't seem to feel like the recycling should be taken out.  Doesn't help me with general chores, and is a bit clueless when it comes to maintaining a clean living space.

I'm starting to feel like his mother, and I really don't like it.

Therefore, we ended up having a fight because the tea leaves in the kitchen sink drain set me off.  I got very upset with him because he is always so careless and I'm sick of picking up after him.  He said he was sorry, but to be honest I don't believe him and I think he'll just keep playing the stupid card.  Am I the asshole for getting angry ?

I am furious for having entertained his behaviour, and he doesn't seem to be able to learn.  I do feel like an asshole, however I can't help but feel like it comes from a legitimate place.  Some outside views / opinions may help me, and I would greatly appreciate your input.

Also, if I //am// being the asshole, please tell me- I understand if I am being unreasonable.

I've brought this up many times during the 2+ years that we have been living together.  It has been an ongoing issue that seems to have no resolution.  I am very tired of it.

  
My reason for writing all of this tonight is because I was using the kitchen earlier in the day.  Long story short, I was peeling potatoes as one does, and made sure that the sink was clear of potato skins.  I chucked the skins into the trash like a normal person.

Then a bit later, boyfriend was cleaning out his teapot and left the tea leaves in the sink, clogging the drain.  I couldn't help but get a bit upset because we've had issues with our kitchen sink being clogged for a good 6 + months beforehand.  Naturally, we had a fight about it, and to be honest I'm still rather upset.  He does nothing around the house- he doesn't feel the need to take out the trash, doesn't seem to feel like the recycling should be taken out.  Doesn't help me with general chores, and is a bit clueless when it comes to maintaining a clean living space.

I'm starting to feel like his mother, and I really don't like it.

  
Therefore, we ended up having a fight because the tea leaves in the kitchen sink drain set me off.  I got very upset with him because he is always so careless and I'm sick of picking up after him.  He said he was sorry, but to be honest I don't believe him and I think he'll just keep playing the stupid card.  Am I the asshole for getting angry ?

I am furious for having entertained his behaviour, and he doesn't seem to be able to learn.  I do feel like an asshole, however I can't help but feel like it comes from a legitimate place.  Some outside views / opinions may help me, and I would greatly appreciate your input.  

  
Also, if I //am// being the asshole, please tell me- I understand if I am being unreasonable.

all i'm really looking for is something with a good balance of smoky, woody, and dark fruit, more subtle on the gourmand because i don't love it to be too sweet. any suggestions/recs are deeply appreciated, especially ones that are reasonably priced (with $200 if possible)! :)",1,1737439351.0,FemFragLab,1,1.0,False

Greece is a dream destination for many travelers. With its stunning landscapes, rich history, and vibrant culture, the country offers unforgettable experiences. Whether you’re seeking beautiful beaches, ancient ruins, or charming villages, Greece has something for everyone. Here are some of the best places to travel in Greece that you simply cannot miss.

One of the most famous islands in Greece, Santorini, is renowned for its breathtaking sunsets and whitewashed buildings. As you wander through the picturesque streets of Oia, you’ll find stunning views of the Aegean Sea. Be sure to indulge in local delicacies at one of the many cliffside restaurants. Don’t forget to visit the archaeological site of Akrotiri, an ancient Minoan city preserved by volcanic ash.

### Mykonos: The Island of Partying

Mykonos is the go-to island for those who love vibrant nightlife. Its beaches are filled with sun loungers and beach bars. During the day, enjoy the sun at famous spots like Paradise Beach. As night falls, head to Mykonos Town, where nightclubs and bars come alive. The iconic windmills and the charming Little Venice area make for excellent photo opportunities, too.

Crete offers a little bit of everything, making it an ideal travel destination.

### Delphi: A Journey into the Ancient World

Visiting Delphi is like stepping back in time. Once considered the center of the world in ancient Greek mythology, this UNESCO World Heritage site is home to the Temple of Apollo. Wander through the ruins and soak in the views of the surrounding mountains. The Delphi Archaeological Museum showcases artifacts that speak to the region’s storied past, making it a must-see for history buffs.

Rhodes is known for its well-preserved medieval town, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Pack your bags and prepare to explore some of the best places to travel in Greece, where unforgettable memories await you.

The Rich History and Culture of Greece: Enhancing Your Travel Experience
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you think of Greece, vibrant images of sun-kissed islands and ancient ruins come to mind. However, the rich history and culture of Greece add depth to your travel experience, inviting you to explore beyond its stunning landscapes. From the Meltemi winds of the Aegean Sea to the echoes of philosophers wandering through historic cities, there’s so much more waiting to be discovered.

One of the best ways to immerse yourself in Greek culture is by visiting its historical sites. Greece is often referred to as the cradle of Western civilization. Here, you can witness the remnants of ancient gods and heroes. Think of places like:

- **Acropolis of Athens:** This UNESCO World Heritage site, dominated by the Parthenon, offers a glimpse into ancient Greek architecture and religion.
- **Delphi:** Once considered the center of the universe by the ancient Greeks, Delphi is rich in mythology and ancient prophecy.
- **Olympia:** The birthplace of the Olympic Games, where you can see ruins and even the original Olympic site.

Each of these locations has stories to share. By engaging with local guides and museums, you’ll unlock the secrets of Greek history and appreciate the context behind what you see. You might find yourself imagining the days when philosophers debated in public squares or when athletes competed for glory.

Traditional festivals are another element that can enhance your Greek travel experience. Throughout the year, various events celebrate local customs, food, and music. If you’re fortunate, you might coincide your visit with major festivals like:

- **Apokries:** A lively carnival held before Lent, featuring parades, masquerades, and lots of dancing.
- **Panagia Festival:** Celebrated on August 15th, it honors the Virgin Mary with feasts and processions in many towns.

Participating in these traditions allows you to connect with the heart of Greek culture. You’ll enjoy regional cuisines, dance along with locals, and witness the joy these celebrations bring to communities. Don’t be shy to ask for a dance or share a meal; the warmth of Greek hospitality is renowned worldwide.

Moreover, local gastronomy is an integral part of Greek culture that shouldn’t be overlooked. Make sure to indulge your taste buds with traditional dishes such as:

- **Souvlaki:** Grilled meat skewers, perfect for a quick and delicious meal.
- **Moussaka:** A savory casserole made with layers of eggplant, minced meat, and béchamel sauce.
- **Baklava:** A sweet pastry filled with nuts and honey, ideal for dessert.

Exploring local markets can enhance your food journey. Places like the Varvakios Agora in Athens offer a sensory overload of sights, sounds, and smells. Take time to chat with local vendors, and you might even pick up some tips on preparing traditional Greek dishes at home.

Arts and music further enrich the cultural landscape of Greece. Visiting a theater performance or a live music venue provides an intimate way to enjoy the talents of local artists. The captivating sounds of bouzouki and the rhythms of traditional Greek dances can be truly mesmerizing.

Room for reflection exists on the beautiful islands scattered across the Aegean and Ionian Seas. Each island presents its unique character and history. Santorini, with its stunning sunsets and white-washed buildings, offers a romantic atmosphere that contrasts wonderfully with the more rugged beauty of Crete, where ancient Minoan civilization flourished.

Consider taking part in workshops or classes focusing on traditional Greek crafts. Whether it's pottery, weaving, or olive oil tasting, engaging in these activities provides you with hands-on experience and a deeper appreciation for Greece's artistic heritage.

Merging your travel itinerary with a touch of Greek history and culture can significantly enhance your journey. Embrace the chance to explore ancient ruins, indulge in local cuisine, and connect with the spirited traditions that define Greece. By doing so, you transform your visit into an immersive experience steeped in the richness of this beautiful country.

### Conclusion

Whether you're wandering through the ancient ruins of Athens, basking in the sun on Santorini’s breathtaking cliffs, or sipping ouzo in a quaint tavern on Crete, Greece offers a mosaic of experiences that cater to every type of traveler. Each destination boasts a unique story, inviting you to explore the echoes of a rich history that shaped not only the country but also Western civilization. The Acropolis stands tall as a testament to human achievement, while the vibrant streets of Thessaloniki are alive with modern culture intertwined with historical narratives.

Visiting Greece is not just about the stunning scenery; it’s about immersing yourself in the local traditions and culinary delights that have been passed down through generations. Imagine savoring a traditional Greek salad, enjoying freshly caught seafood, or partaking in a lively local festival. These experiences deepen your connection to the land and its people, enhancing your journey far beyond the mere tourist attractions.

As you plan your trip, keep in mind that each region has its own allure, from ancient ruins and artistic masterpieces to breathtaking landscapes and serene beaches. Take your time, embrace the slower pace of life, and allow each moment to capture your heart. Your adventure in Greece isn’t just a vacation; it’s a chance to create unforgettable memories that will last a lifetime. Explore these best places to travel in Greece, and allow the country’s unique blend of history, culture, and natural beauty to touch your spirit as you embark on this incredible journey.

Palate: The palate has an earthy coffee and chocolate that is moderately caramel like, slightly sweet but not overly so. Some oaky notes in there as well.

Finish: The finish is medium to short, the slight sweetness leaves the mouth first,  and those same notes of coffee and dark  chocolate are there along with some Oak for the rest of the finish.

An interesting blend, not very complex, but quite enjoyable. I believe that it is a Rum that most people would enjoy, and that it would be a Rum that drinkers of the ""sweeter"" Rums would be able to tolerate and maybe get more interested in less sweeter Rums than they are used to.

I’ve been a loyal customer for 5 years. Few weeks ago I took two friends. One friend is Russian. He paid for our drinks and asked for them to stay. He didn’t tip the barista.

He said we asked for it to stay this barista woman who I’ve noticed has worked there for like 4 years said “ we are out of cups- also you didn’t tip” my friend was very confused and slightly appalled. This place is commonly busy. Lines to the door. Then yesterday I went with another friend. Same thing. We asked for to stay and they purposefully took longer with our order and put it in to go cups.

I've been in the Annapurna twice, and the circuit is quite easy to follow so I knew I couldn't get lost by myself. It took nine days and my total spend was = approximately 18,000 rupees ($135USD) including transportation, meals and hotels. This does not include Annapurna permit cost (about $25) and bus ticket to Besisahar 🙃.

I tracked my expenses and kept a detailed breakdown somewhere from this trek, but now can't seem to find it. But below you can see my expenses breakdown for my most recent trek in Langtang (north of Kathmandu), and the expenses are roughly the same. On the trekking routes, you can stay in guesthouses for free about 80% of the time, and in return they ask you to eat there.

**Langtang National Park:** My original goal was to jog up to the Everest Basecamp and run down, because I had about a week before my flight out of Nepal. I reckoned it was cutting it too close, and the Everest national park is quite far to reach without a flight, so I would have spent too much time on buses. So instead I decided to head to Langtang, which is much closer to Kathmandu, after hearing many good things.

Day 1 - Bus from Kathmandu to Bamboo village

Day 2 - Bamboo village to Kyanjin Kharka

Day 3 - Climb Kyanjin Ri and back to Langtang village

Day 4 - Langtang village back to Syaprubesi and bus back to Kathmandu

**Total cost (from Kathmandu and back) was $78 including permit.**

***Langtang Expenses***

*Altitude tablets + water purification pills + electrolyte packets = 200 rupees*

*3,000 (permit) + 950 (bus ticket) + 300 (dal bhat) +75 (cookies)*

*1,200 (food) + 100 (hot water) + 720 (chowmein + hot water) + 200 (soap and tooth brush)*

*1400 (food) = 8145 + 450 (chowmein) + 900 (dal bhat + hot water) + 950 (return bus ticket) = 10,445 nepal rupees / $78 USD*

Number of leeches = 5 (4 on last day)

Note that I went at a rather quick pace and the trek often takes 6-7 days. I start early and intermittent fast until dinner, drinking black coffee I make myself.

**Here are some notes I wrote down during my Annapurna circuit trek:**

1. You should try and leave Pokhara as early as possible, catching a bus to Besihar. From there, you might be able to get a jeep or hitchhike further on. I would definitely recommend spending the first night in Chame if you can make it in the first day, which is at 2,600 meters.
2. There is also a clinic in Chame which can supply you with electrolyte packets and tablets to help prevent you from getting altitude sickness in the days ahead, so try and stop there if you can (there is also one in Manang too if you miss it). They do not charge anything for this service, it is donation only 🙏
3. There is a road that goes all the way from Besisahar to Khangsar (the next village after Manang), so you don't need to walk the whole way. If you see motorbikes coming then try to hitchhike whenever you can to save time and conserve energy.
4. You do not need to pack anything. Some water, a bar of soap, water purification tablets, and something to protect from the sun (such as bandanas to cover your face or sunscreen). That's it. Maybe a bag of oatmeal and a thermos if you'd like to prepare a snack for the trail.

Any value from any extra items you bring will be diminished by the extra weight that you will have to carry all day every day. You don't even need to bring changes of clothes, you can just wash your clothes with water and soap in the evenings at your hotel. Walking sticks or bamboo sticks are also recommended.

5. Do not drink tap water, even if locals (or other trekkers) say it's ok to drink. I had my bottle filled with tap water in Chyamche and was puking all night into the morning. Tap water that has been boiled is safe. There are also water purification tablets that you can buy at many stores, I bought a pack of 50 for Rs.250. You can add these to tapwater to be on the safe side.

Two things you will always need to refill constantly are water and phone battery. You can bring along a power bank if needed but honestly you should be using your phone as little as possible.

6. At hotels in Tilicho basecamp an espresso coffee costs 900 rupees (!!!) Wean yourself off of coffee or get a portable Vietnamese coffee filter and some powder in Pokhara so that you can make your own coffee for free.

The power is often out in the morning so make sure your phone is fully charged every evening when you arrive at your lodging.

7. The whole Annapurna circuit goes around the Annapurna mountain range, following low lying rivers so it's impossible to get lost. It's totally different than treks that go into the Annapurna mountains like Annapurna basecamp and Mardi Himal (which are more like jungle treks).

8. Unlike treks in the Annapurnas, there were no leeches on this one.

Nasal breathing is virtually impossible trekking at higher altitudes. My lips are the most chapped they've ever been, even applying petroleum jelly to them twice a day.

9. Even though places like the Annapurna and Everest have become very popular with tourists, please remember that this is not a trip to Disneyland. It is still the Himalayas. And it will be one of the toughest challenges you ever take in your life.

I want to start collecting/using actual perfumes beyond a couple Bath and Body Works mists lmao, but would like some recommendations?
If anyone has smelled You're The One by B&BWs I'd like something similar to that? It's just so elegant and pretty, I've heard Lancôme's Idôle smells similar but I've never smelled it so I can't compare.
Besides that I'd really like some Goth-ish?, dark mysterious pretty florals. Like Black Opium I think, similar to those vibes.. (I don't own it, only smelled from a sample)..also really like coffee notes/rose/most florals..the recs don't have to have a mix of those by the way. Last thing I'll add is that I'm more on a budget (probably not spending $250-300+ on one perfume).. not sure what else to put lol but I'm open to any suggestions based on this vague description, even on the more expensive side!

we worked in a restaurant, im a server and he’s a busser. 

he is EXTREMELY loved by everyone there. they adore him. he can do nothing wrong at all. ever. he’s friendly, warm, caring, talks to everyone, jokes with everyone. super sweet to the guests and JUST CARES SO MUCH ABOUT THEM. everyone fawns over him. 

he is very into art, and he will attend peoples shows, listen to their music, help them with creative outlets, etc. for example, he helped me with my writing and spent like an hour helping me fix things with his suggestions. 

when people do a good job, he does seem genuinely happy for them. and if he is praised, he just smiles and thanks you. 

HOWEVER. he totally love bombed me. was all over me right from the start, spent hours and hours with me, everyone saw how attached he was to me and how he was “different” with me. i literally was obsessed with him. he remembered every detail about me, seemed to know me so well, picked on me and made me laugh, it was like i had known him my whole life. he was wonderful. 

but he didn’t want to date, and as soon as i called him out on leading me on, he completely flipped. flirting one day, mean the next. ignoring for a week, then sitting and talking with me over drinks. i couldn’t please him, he was always irritated at something. he would tell me that coworkers told him i said something about him, accuse me of opening my mouth, etc. it was never ending and i was paranoid at work when i talked to people for fear they would tell him something. 

he also was wildly controlling with me. telling me what to do, telling me like how to eat a certain way or drink my coffee certain ways or act a certain way. he knew BETTER and he was NEVER WRONG and if i tried to talk to him about things he would dominate the conversation. he wouldn’t even let me speak. one time he demanded he knew that i had a fever (i didn’t) and he made me take medication and then came to check on me and see if it went away. he also answered questions for me asked by other coworkers and insisted he knew how i would answer. 

it went on and on, and i really did not let up on calling him out on his bullshit. he HATED it, and i know now it was probably because i was threatening to expose this image of him. he finally smeared me to EVERYONE and everyone thought i was obsessed with him at this point. which, i was, because i had totally let him drain me. he even got HR involved. 

i finally had to leave the job, and he still lurks on social media even though he has a new supply. i unfortunately reached out, and then he unfriended me, and sent all our old coworkers after me. i had to delete all them too. 

i haven’t been able to find much information on this situation. because it seems like maybe he’s not a full narcissist or maybe just REALLY GOOD at what he does? his humbleness and passiveness and friendliness with coworkers really throws me, while he was insanely dominant with me. 

any insight would be so helpful! ",5,1737438581.0,ManagedByNarcissists,0,1.0,False
1i6buf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/1i6buf2/seeking_advice_buying_property_and_building_a/,Seeking Advice: Buying Property and Building a House in Kyoto,"Hi everyone,

We're currently in the process of looking for a property to build a house in Kyoto and would love some advice. Here’s our situation:

We're looking for a property around **120 sq. meters (40 tsubo)** within a budget of **under 30 million yen (3000 man)**. Ideally, we want the location to allow for a **relatively easy commute (public transport) to Imadegawa/Demachiyanagi Station**. My current commute from Kobe is 1.5+ hours, and I’d like to improve this.

So far, we've been focusing on areas **to the north and west of Demachiyanagi (Kamigyo, Kita-ku, Iwakura)** and along the **Hankyu and JR lines** (from **Arashiyama** down to **Nagaoka-kyo**). However, we’ve encountered several challenges:

1. **Strict Fuchichiku (**風致地区**) regulations** in Kyoto make it difficult to use design we want (we have a particular builder/design in mind, while it's not anything wild, it is not practical to modify it to fit Kyoto regulations - we'd rather choose property not in Fuchichiku area). 
2. While we’ve searched on big aggregators like **Suumo** and **Nifty**, there seem to be very few options in our price range (and we have to manually re-check Fuchichiku status of each lot, since it's not always mentioned). Even our house builder (they have Kyoto branch in Uji), who is also helping us with the search, hasn’t found anything viable yet.

Because of this, we’re now considering areas like **Katsurazaka (Nishi-kyo)** and **Nagaoka-kyo** as our primary options. We like the environment, wider roads, highway access, and the availability of both JR and Hankyu lines. That said:

* **Nagaoka-kyo** feels smaller and less comfortable (access to shops etc) compared to Katsurazaka, but I’m not too familiar with the area yet. Both areas require around 45-60 mins to commute. They miss ""the Kyoto"" vibe, so we might not be able to just get on bikes and ride to some random coffee shop in the center of Kyoto (maybe Arashiyama is in the reach?).
* **Fushimi-ku** and **Yamashina** sometimes have surprisingly good lots, but the infrastructure (e.g., narrow roads, overall exterior) is hard to accept. Driving there is stressful, and getting around the city feels inconvenient. Riding bicycle there feels dangerous. 
* **Shiga (Otsu)** was also considered, but lots near commute lines are expensive, and affordable options are too far out. 
* We aren't looking into **Takatsuki** or more to the south since we would like to move to Kyoto area after all.

Given the above challenges, we feel a bit stuck after 6 months of browsing Suumo and driving to various locations to check the actual lots. We would appreciate insights or suggestions. Has anyone navigated similar issues in Kyoto? Are there smaller companies or alternative strategies for finding lots that we should explore? What’s your experience with Katsurazaka vs. Nagaoka-kyo, or even other neighborhoods that fit my criteria?

Background: I (M39) have PR and my wife is Japanese. Our budget is around 60 mil jpy for house + property. Our builder estimates the house and related costs as around 30 mil jpy, so we have 30 mil jpy in mind for property. We will be getting a loan and our combined annual income is around 18 mil jpy.

Thanks in advance for your help!",1,1737438401.0,japanlife,1,1.0,False

Last week I asked this girl if she'd like to go out for coffee over the weekend. She said she yes but she couldn't make the weekend plans because she goes back home over the weekends, while I live full time on campus. She then gave me her schedule of when's she's free during the week. I texted her Monday and stuck up a conversation. I asked if she was ready to go back to our freezing cold campus, but she said she's stuck at home or smth. Apparently her house got 3 feet of snow. On campus there's only 6 inches. We do go to college in upstate New York, where the weather is crazy like that due to lakes and stuff diverting the winds. She's also probably exaggerating when she says she's stuck and can't go anywhere, but idk.
I'm trying to be confident in myself, and I am, but it's stuff like this that's so confusing. Because on one hand it seems like a valid excuse, but in the other it's a serious of unfortunate events that would never happen in real life. And it's not like I can just ask directly if she still wants to go out because then id seem desperate and unconfident and just lame in general.

Ultimately I'm taking that as a ""I don't want to go out"" hint, and I'm just gonna give up with her. It sucks because I really wanted to meet her, but what can you do. I also know for a fact if I never texted again I'd never hear from her first, so that should be reason enough to give up.

Now I use Autovoice as a way to trigger Alexa routines. I combine Autovoice with autolocation for geofencing.

However sometimes the autovoice Action fails probably because it's amazon and unreliable as heck.  So I want to add a 2nd and 3rd routine which will activate only if Action 1 fails. 

I've read about things like in action 2 to set an IF statement. And use   
""If %err  IS SET"" or ""If %err !\~ %+"" or ""If %err !\~R \[%\]err"". The thing is I'd like to understand this. What does IS SET do? And what is the difference between \~! and !\~R? Also for the value section on the right side. What does ""%+"" mean? Same thing for ""%err"" being on the right side in the value section. 

Again i kinda know that !\~ means does not match. and !\~R means does not match Regex. But I'm not sure what a Regex is.  

The last bit I'm confused about the purposes are the icons for the if sections. There is an icon that looks like a price tag, one as magnify glass and one as a coffee cup. 

Trust me I've searched for tutorials but a lot of the explanations assumes the reader already knows how to program in a certain type of script.

1i6bot8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i6bot8,Opinion on Cheap hand grinders!,"Here is my opinion on the cheap grinder situation, I've seen a lot of queries regarding the grinders that are available for very cheap prices ie. 600-1200₹. And the most common response to such queries is to save up 4-5k for a better grinder than spending your money buying a cheap one. 
But here is the hot take I want to give - anyone who is getting newly into the coffee world especially a student won't be able to afford the 4-5k grinder for years to come because coffee is just a hobby and no body wants to go too fast too early neither do we can expect them to, and to be honest the advice ""use pre ground coffee till then"" don't seem very good to me, as it keeps the newcomers away form the most essential thing, getting involved in the process. As a newbie you don't expect Hoffman level coffee to blow your mind. A simple cup made by you will exceed every expectation that you have from coffee. 4k tag drives away people more than getting them into coffee and honestly you don't need 4k grinder to enjoy your coffee. It definitely improves the quality by a huge margin, but for a person who spent 2rs for a instant coffee pouch even 600₹ is so much. 

From a very critical and analytical perspective saving for a good grinder is the only good choice but humans don't really work like that. 
Getting a cheap grinder might not give you the best coffee but it gives you a satisfaction of accomplishing something on your own the happiness that you made this cup. It engages you more towards your hobby, more so that one day you'll buy that expensive grinder definitely. 
Getting a grinder may it be a pepper mill will always be better than getting pre ground coffee because you get involved in the ritual of coffee making. And the most important thing pre-ground bros are missing is that aroma of grinding fresh. 

TL;DR - Just get a grinder cheap or expensive if you're toddler in coffee making it'll definitely get you hooked to make your own coffee. The Joy of grinding your own is far greater than a cup made by someone else. 

Even mixer grinder will do, just don't grind whole pack. Only one serving (12-18gms) at a time.

Most of the art and culture up here is geared towards retirees and wives of wealthy dudes, it’s incredibly hard to meet other like-minded people my age, and there really aren’t many groups or classes nearby that I’m interested in. It seems like there’s more for me in Dallas. I’m definitely more introverted, but I miss being in the middle of everything and I wanna give Dallas proper a try.

Important things for me:

- nature access. Trees are my lifeline and I will suffer if I cannot put my toes in the dirt at times (currently in that rn). Trails, waterfront access, any way for me to hang out with plants is necessary if I’m going to move.
- I don’t mind spending around $1600 a month, maybe $1700 if I need to for a decently sized 1 bedroom apartment.
- Access to more artsy neighborhoods would be lovely
- My job is in Allen so would need to have easy access to 75.

I’ll be visiting Sydney in a couple of months, and one of my stops will be the downtown area. I really enjoy staying at Marriott properties, so my two options are the Four Points in the Chippendale area or the Sheraton in the Hyde Park area.

Which area do you think is better in terms of restaurants, coffee shops, bars, safety, and nightlife? Thanks in advance!",2,1737437482.0,sydney,9,0.67,False

 * [**Pimped-up instant noodles**](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/biggest-food-trends-for-2025) - I noticed that TKMaxx had various ""ramen condiment sets"" this Christmas

 * [**Hot honey**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lelalondon/2024/12/27/hot-honey-is-going-to-be-everywhere-in-2025/) - supposedly this was supposed to take over the world last year, but didn’t seem to, but it’s being tipped again for 2025 - a recent BBC podcast had a food expert suggesting it’s the ""new salted caramel""

 * [**Pistachio**](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/biggest-food-trends-for-2025) - apparently this is taking over from hazelnut, Messina has been doing a tonne of pistachio specials recently

 * [**Brown sugar**](https://www.delicious.com.au/food-files/news-articles/article/food-trends-2025/wh5f8cfk) - particularly unrefined and organic brown sugars

 * [**Matcha**](https://www.formulafoods.com.au/news-and-insights/top-flavour-trends-2025-part2) - this one seems to have been big for a while, but maybe it’s getting even bigger? Same with yuzu that some analysts also predict to be big in 2025, it's already widespread here

There was a faint electric crackle over the headset as Donovan considered his next move. We were miles apart, separated by a heavy snowstorm that left the outside world in a blur of white fuzz. In my mind, I could still see him squirming in his computer chair, could picture his lips gently moving as he whispered to himself his next move. 

""King to D7,"" Donovan replied. 

""Can't. Queen at A4. You'll put yourself in check."" 

A faint groan escaped through the headphones. Donovan had been operating on maybe three hours of sleep. His head wasn't in the game. The nightmares were getting to him. Getting to us all in their own way, but I was used to little sleep. 

Before I started working at the United States remote research station: Outpost Delta, I lived with my older brother and his girlfriend. They had a 2 year old and a newborn. Sleep was a luxury that I hadn't experienced for about three years running. 

""Fine,"" Donovan said defiantly. ""King to C8."" 

""Knight to E7. Check...again."" 

""Emma, you think I don't see what you're doing?"" 

""Please, enlighten me."" I had to stifle the laughter from my voice. ""What am I doing?"" 

""Trying to force me into the corner,"" Donovan returned. ""You're lucky I don't have my queen anymore. Your king is wide open."" 

""You should probably do something about that once you're not in check."" 

""Yeah, real funny. Keep laughing."" He didn't make a move for a while, and when he did, there was a growl in his voice. ""King to B8."" 

""You're getting awfully close to that corner, my friend."" 

""Why couldn't we have just played Guess Who like I wanted?"" 

""Because we've played Guess Who almost a hundred times by now, and I'm sick of it."" 

""But I hate Chess. I actually hate it."" 

""You just don't have the patience for it."" 

In the year we'd known each other, that was the first thing I came to find out about him. The second was that he was an immense cinephile. When he wasn't wasting his time playing board games with me, or working, he was on the couch watching a movie with a bag of popcorn in his lap. 

""You know what I miss?"" he said. 

""Papa John's pizza and Netflix?"" 

""Come on! I mean, who doesn't?"" We laughed about that. ""I miss Runescape."" 

""Never got into it. My brother did for a while."" 

""Let me tell you, it's a lot more fun than Chess."" 

""You're only saying that because you're losing."" 

Before he could respond, another voice intercepted our conversation. ""Have either of you talked to Edvard lately?"" 

It was Mia from Cabin G. We were all part of a research team observing odd phenomenon in Antarctica. Recent tremors and unusual climate habits. Harsh storms. At least two or three occurrences a week followed by hot days. Not necessarily hot in the normal sense, but relatively, it was warmer in the artic than it should've been. 

""No, I don't think so."" I double-checked the daily log beside my computer rig. ""He hasn't been on the public channel since this morning."" 

""Don?"" Mia asked. 

""A quick call on a private channel around two or three,"" he said. ""Nothing important. Just wanted to see if I needed anymore supplies before he sends the registry to the company. Why, what's up?"" 

""He got ahold of me about an hour ago--"" 

""Little early for a booty call, don't you think?"" 

The airwaves went silent aside from the static. I clamped my hand over my mouth to keep from laughing. 

""Sorry, not funny,"" Donovan said, but his tone implied otherwise. ""Seriously, though, what's up?"" 

""Nothing,"" she said, ""I just can't get ahold of him."" 

""He's probably taking a nap. Hard to keep a normal sleep schedule out here."" 

He wasn't wrong. The nights felt endless, and the daytime was fleeting at best. Perpetual darkness around the clock. The increase in storms weren't helping either. It was hard to get out from under the covers when you were constantly bombarded by the cold. 

Our cabins had heating systems, but it just wasn't the same. Wasn't as cozy or safe as being beneath the blankets the company provided us with. 

Some days, you know the type, I didn't get out of my pajamas. On those mornings, I wouldn't even bother with a cup of coffee. Instead, I'd just make some hot chocolate, curl up in my computer chair with a blanket draped across my shoulders, and try not to fall asleep. 

It was especially difficult during the off season. The rest of our colleagues were airlifted home for the holidays. The four of us 'volunteered' to stay behind as the skeleton crew. Keep up with the research and monitoring until the New Year passed. 

The others were scheduled to return January 6th. Then, we would get transported back home for about a week and a half to visit our relatives or do whatever we wanted. Not a bad trade-off considering the extra pay. Time and a half for the weekdays, double time for the weekends. 

""I don't know,"" Mia said softly. Her voice was a faint whisper against the wall of static from the storm. ""Something doesn't feel right."" 

""What'd he last say to you?"" I asked. 

""He thought someone was knocking on his door."" 

""Bullshit,"" Donovan cut in. 

""No, he did!"" 

""I'm not saying he didn't, but that's impossible. There's no one else out here but us. Guy just needs to get more sleep."" 

Again, he wasn't wrong. But to get more sleep implied getting any sleep to begin with. 

""That's not all,"" Mia continued. ""He checked outside his front door and found footprints in the snow. Thought he saw someone out there too."" 

I swiveled in my chair, turning to access the navigational radar to the left of my computer
The display showed a circular grid with all the cabins pre-rendered into the system. When we had a full team, there would have been twenty-six colored dots on the screen. One at every cabin. 

Instead, there were only four available. One at Cabin C (Donovan), another at Cabin J (that was me), and a third at Cabin Y (Mia). Edvard was supposed to be at Cabin R, but his transmitter was casting a signal about two miles north of Cabin M. 

""What the hell?"" I whispered, restarting the system in hopes that it might recalibrate. 

It had done this before. Almost two months ago. There was an interference of some kind that set all of our equipment on the fritz. GPS kept scattering our transmitters. Lights were going on and off. Communications were down for half the cabins. Everything was a mess. 

Oscar, from Cabin D, even had his power go out. Luckily, the back-up generator kicked on long enough until Rita, from Cabin L, got over there to perform some much-needed maintenance on his fusebox. Blown circuit, corroded wires. Whole thing had to be replaced. 

It was a bad time for Donovan. The company couldn't send replacement parts for almost a week, so he and Oscar had to share a living space for a little while. The cabins are about the size of a studio apartment, maybe slightly bigger. As you might imagine, cramped spaces aren't an ideal environment for multiple people. And you can't exactly complain about the other person without being overheard. 

After the fact, they were good sports about it. Oscar requested a care package during a supply order. Choclate-covered cherries, a variety pack of chips, and a whole assortment of other goodies that he sent Donovan's way. In return, Donovan ordered some books, movies, and video games for Oscar's 3DS. 

Eventually, the radar came back online, the dots remained the same. Edvard's transmitter still put him out by Cabin M, located in the middle of nowhere. 

""Hey, Mia,"" I spoke into the mic, ""did Edvard say anything else to you?"" 

""No,"" she said. ""I told him they were probably his footprints from last night or something. Told him that there's no out here but us."" 

""I checked the radar, looks like he's out by Henry's place."" 

""What the hell is he doing out there?"" Donovan remarked. 

""No clue,"" I said. ""You guys keep trying his handheld. I'll take the Snow Cat out to him and see whats going on. If you manage to get a hold of him, radio me."" 

The cabins were each located about a mile apart from each other. The distance could vary depending on the terrain. A lengthy distanceon foot, but a quick trip for the plow. 

Of course, that was assuming the weather would be forgiving. Unfortunately, it wasn't. 

Snow came down in curtains, pelting the windshield with bits of ice, sticking to its surface. I turned the wipers on, but there was only so much they could do in a storm. 

It took me about half an hour to get there. Even when I arrived, I couldn't be sure if Edvard was actually present. Everything was white, and the snow flurries were funneling in a conical pattern, spinning around me until up was down and left was right. 

I pulled the hood of my coat over my head and anchored myself to the Snow Cat with climbing rope. Thick and durable. A reel almost 100 yards in length. Enough to travel the span of a football field. 

It might sound dumb, but in an environment like that, it doesn't take much to get lost. And with the low temps, you can't be exposed to the cold for more than maybe ten to twenty minutes without facing serious repercussions. 

I had to wonder how long Edvard had been out there. How long he'd been exposed. 

I checked the compass I kept in my coat pocket and wandered out into the storm heading northeast. Every analyst was equipped with proper gear for outdoor travel: boots, an insulated coat and pants, gloves, goggles, and a face mask. Still, the cold was unbearable. Felt like my skin was on fire, and I'd only been out there for a few minutes. 

I called out to Edvard, but there was no response. The howl of the wind was too ferocious, too powerful. Every word was swallowed by it, suppressed into a muffled whisper. I got lucky though. Edvard had left his Snow Cat's headlights on, and through the mist, I followed the pair of yellow beams until I stood before the mechanical beast. 

The windows were frosted over, and the exterior was coated in snow. I pulled on the handle and threw the driver's side door open. It was empty, but the interior lights were still on. I could hear Donovan's and Mia's voices coming in over the radio. 

""Houston to Edvard, you there Edvard?"" Donovan said. ""Do you read me, space cadet?"" 

""Ed?"" came Mia. ""Can you hear me?"" 

I moved to answer their calls, but then, out the other window, I saw a silhouette against the white backdrop of the blizzard. 

I leapt from the Snow Cat and sprinted towards the shadow. My boots were heavy and awkward. The insulated padding for the coat and pants didn't allow much in the way of mobility. It was like trying to walk in one of those inflatable Halloween costumes, constantly stumbling with every step. 

Eventually, after waddling the last ten or so feet, I had reached him. He stood still as a corpse, staring down at the ground. He was dressed in gear similar to mine, his own colored a shade of orange. But after so long in the storm, it had all been frosted white. An anatomically correct snowman. 

Usually, you can tell when a person is breathing because of the fog around their mouth, but there was no mist with Edvard. No indication of life until I grabbed his shoulder. Then, he turned towards me, his face concealed beneath a pair of goggles and a thick balaclava. 

""Come on!"" I yelled. ""You're going to freeze to death out here!"" 

Somehow, in spite of the wind or the sound of my beating heart, I heard Edvard speak. A frail, breathless whisper: ""I was here.""",1,1737437421.0,clancypasta,0,1.0,False

""A quick call on a private channel around two or three,"" he said. ""Nothing important. Just wanted to see if I needed anymore supplies before he sends the registry to the company. Why, what's up?"" 

""He got ahold of me about an hour ago--"" 

""Little early for a booty call, don't you think?"" 

The airwaves went silent aside from the static. I clamped my hand over my mouth to keep from laughing. 

""Sorry, not funny,"" Donovan said, but his tone implied otherwise. ""Seriously, though, what's up?"" 

""Nothing,"" she said, ""I just can't get ahold of him."" 

""He's probably taking a nap. Hard to keep a normal sleep schedule out here."" 

He wasn't wrong. The nights felt endless, and the daytime was fleeting at best. Perpetual darkness around the clock. The increase in storms weren't helping either. It was hard to get out from under the covers when you were constantly bombarded by the cold. 

Our cabins had heating systems, but it just wasn't the same. Wasn't as cozy or safe as being beneath the blankets the company provided us with. 

Some days, you know the type, I didn't get out of my pajamas. On those mornings, I wouldn't even bother with a cup of coffee. Instead, I'd just make some hot chocolate, curl up in my computer chair with a blanket draped across my shoulders, and try not to fall asleep. 

It was especially difficult during the off season. The rest of our colleagues were airlifted home for the holidays. The four of us 'volunteered' to stay behind as the skeleton crew. Keep up with the research and monitoring until the New Year passed. 

The others were scheduled to return January 6th. Then, we would get transported back home for about a week and a half to visit our relatives or do whatever we wanted. Not a bad trade-off considering the extra pay. Time and a half for the weekdays, double time for the weekends. 

""I don't know,"" Mia said softly. Her voice was a faint whisper against the wall of static from the storm. ""Something doesn't feel right."" 

""What'd he last say to you?"" I asked. 

""He thought someone was knocking on his door."" 

""Bullshit,"" Donovan cut in. 

""No, he did!"" 

""I'm not saying he didn't, but that's impossible. There's no one else out here but us. Guy just needs to get more sleep."" 

Again, he wasn't wrong. But to get more sleep implied getting any sleep to begin with. 

""That's not all,"" Mia continued. ""He checked outside his front door and found footprints in the snow. Thought he saw someone out there too."" 

I swiveled in my chair, turning to access the navigational radar to the left of my computer
The display showed a circular grid with all the cabins pre-rendered into the system. When we had a full team, there would have been twenty-six colored dots on the screen. One at every cabin. 

Instead, there were only four available. One at Cabin C (Donovan), another at Cabin J (that was me), and a third at Cabin Y (Mia). Edvard was supposed to be at Cabin R, but his transmitter was casting a signal about two miles north of Cabin M. 

""What the hell?"" I whispered, restarting the system in hopes that it might recalibrate. 

It had done this before. Almost two months ago. There was an interference of some kind that set all of our equipment on the fritz. GPS kept scattering our transmitters. Lights were going on and off. Communications were down for half the cabins. Everything was a mess. 

Oscar, from Cabin D, even had his power go out. Luckily, the back-up generator kicked on long enough until Rita, from Cabin L, got over there to perform some much-needed maintenance on his fusebox. Blown circuit, corroded wires. Whole thing had to be replaced. 

It was a bad time for Donovan. The company couldn't send replacement parts for almost a week, so he and Oscar had to share a living space for a little while. The cabins are about the size of a studio apartment, maybe slightly bigger. As you might imagine, cramped spaces aren't an ideal environment for multiple people. And you can't exactly complain about the other person without being overheard. 

After the fact, they were good sports about it. Oscar requested a care package during a supply order. Choclate-covered cherries, a variety pack of chips, and a whole assortment of other goodies that he sent Donovan's way. In return, Donovan ordered some books, movies, and video games for Oscar's 3DS. 

Eventually, the radar came back online, the dots remained the same. Edvard's transmitter still put him out by Cabin M, located in the middle of nowhere. 

""Hey, Mia,"" I spoke into the mic, ""did Edvard say anything else to you?"" 

""No,"" she said. ""I told him they were probably his footprints from last night or something. Told him that there's no out here but us."" 

""I checked the radar, looks like he's out by Henry's place."" 

""What the hell is he doing out there?"" Donovan remarked. 

""No clue,"" I said. ""You guys keep trying his handheld. I'll take the Snow Cat out to him and see whats going on. If you manage to get a hold of him, radio me."" 

The cabins were each located about a mile apart from each other. The distance could vary depending on the terrain. A lengthy distanceon foot, but a quick trip for the plow. 

Of course, that was assuming the weather would be forgiving. Unfortunately, it wasn't. 

Snow came down in curtains, pelting the windshield with bits of ice, sticking to its surface. I turned the wipers on, but there was only so much they could do in a storm. 

It took me about half an hour to get there. Even when I arrived, I couldn't be sure if Edvard was actually present. Everything was white, and the snow flurries were funneling in a conical pattern, spinning around me until up was down and left was right. 

I pulled the hood of my coat over my head and anchored myself to the Snow Cat with climbing rope. Thick and durable. A reel almost 100 yards in length. Enough to travel the span of a football field. 

It might sound dumb, but in an environment like that, it doesn't take much to get lost. And with the low temps, you can't be exposed to the cold for more than maybe ten to twenty minutes without facing serious repercussions. 

I had to wonder how long Edvard had been out there. How long he'd been exposed. 

I checked the compass I kept in my coat pocket and wandered out into the storm heading northeast. Every analyst was equipped with proper gear for outdoor travel: boots, an insulated coat and pants, gloves, goggles, and a face mask. Still, the cold was unbearable. Felt like my skin was on fire, and I'd only been out there for a few minutes. 

I called out to Edvard, but there was no response. The howl of the wind was too ferocious, too powerful. Every word was swallowed by it, suppressed into a muffled whisper. I got lucky though. Edvard had left his Snow Cat's headlights on, and through the mist, I followed the pair of yellow beams until I stood before the mechanical beast. 

The windows were frosted over, and the exterior was coated in snow. I pulled on the handle and threw the driver's side door open. It was empty, but the interior lights were still on. I could hear Donovan's and Mia's voices coming in over the radio. 

""Houston to Edvard, you there Edvard?"" Donovan said. ""Do you read me, space cadet?"" 

""Ed?"" came Mia. ""Can you hear me?"" 

I moved to answer their calls, but then, out the other window, I saw a silhouette against the white backdrop of the blizzard. 

I leapt from the Snow Cat and sprinted towards the shadow. My boots were heavy and awkward. The insulated padding for the coat and pants didn't allow much in the way of mobility. It was like trying to walk in one of those inflatable Halloween costumes, constantly stumbling with every step. 

Eventually, after waddling the last ten or so feet, I had reached him. He stood still as a corpse, staring down at the ground. He was dressed in gear similar to mine, his own colored a shade of orange. But after so long in the storm, it had all been frosted white. An anatomically correct snowman. 

Usually, you can tell when a person is breathing because of the fog around their mouth, but there was no mist with Edvard. No indication of life until I grabbed his shoulder. Then, he turned towards me, his face concealed beneath a pair of goggles and a thick balaclava. 

""Come on!"" I yelled. ""You're going to freeze to death out here!"" 

Somehow, in spite of the wind or the sound of my beating heart, I heard Edvard speak. A frail, breathless whisper: ""I was here.""",1,1737437311.0,ZakBabyTV_Stories,0,1.0,False

There was a faint electric crackle over the headset as Donovan considered his next move. We were miles apart, separated by a heavy snowstorm that left the outside world in a blur of white fuzz. In my mind, I could still see him squirming in his computer chair, could picture his lips gently moving as he whispered to himself his next move. 

""King to D7,"" Donovan replied. 

""Can't. Queen at A4. You'll put yourself in check."" 

A faint groan escaped through the headphones. Donovan had been operating on maybe three hours of sleep. His head wasn't in the game. The nightmares were getting to him. Getting to us all in their own way, but I was used to little sleep. 

Before I started working at the United States remote research station: Outpost Delta, I lived with my older brother and his girlfriend. They had a 2 year old and a newborn. Sleep was a luxury that I hadn't experienced for about three years running. 

""Fine,"" Donovan said defiantly. ""King to C8."" 

""Knight to E7. Check...again."" 

""Emma, you think I don't see what you're doing?"" 

""Please, enlighten me."" I had to stifle the laughter from my voice. ""What am I doing?"" 

""Trying to force me into the corner,"" Donovan returned. ""You're lucky I don't have my queen anymore. Your king is wide open."" 

""You should probably do something about that once you're not in check."" 

""Yeah, real funny. Keep laughing."" He didn't make a move for a while, and when he did, there was a growl in his voice. ""King to B8."" 

""You're getting awfully close to that corner, my friend."" 

""Why couldn't we have just played Guess Who like I wanted?"" 

""Because we've played Guess Who almost a hundred times by now, and I'm sick of it."" 

""But I hate Chess. I actually hate it."" 

""You just don't have the patience for it."" 

In the year we'd known each other, that was the first thing I came to find out about him. The second was that he was an immense cinephile. When he wasn't wasting his time playing board games with me, or working, he was on the couch watching a movie with a bag of popcorn in his lap. 

""You know what I miss?"" he said. 

""Papa John's pizza and Netflix?"" 

""Come on! I mean, who doesn't?"" We laughed about that. ""I miss Runescape."" 

""Never got into it. My brother did for a while."" 

""Let me tell you, it's a lot more fun than Chess."" 

""You're only saying that because you're losing."" 

Before he could respond, another voice intercepted our conversation. ""Have either of you talked to Edvard lately?"" 

It was Mia from Cabin G. We were all part of a research team observing odd phenomenon in Antarctica. Recent tremors and unusual climate habits. Harsh storms. At least two or three occurrences a week followed by hot days. Not necessarily hot in the normal sense, but relatively, it was warmer in the artic than it should've been. 

""No, I don't think so."" I double-checked the daily log beside my computer rig. ""He hasn't been on the public channel since this morning.""

Usually, you can tell when a person is breathing because of the fog around their mouth, but there was no mist with Edvard. No indication of life until I grabbed his shoulder. Then, he turned towards me, his face concealed beneath a pair of goggles and a thick balaclava. 

""Come on!"" I yelled. ""You're going to freeze to death out here!"" 

Somehow, in spite of the wind or the sound of my beating heart, I heard Edvard speak. A frail, breathless whisper: ""I was here.""",1,1737437222.0,mrcreeps,0,1.0,False

1i6bh1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASRock/comments/1i6bh1p/just_a_post_to_report_on_my_higherend_build_for/,Just a post to report on my higher-end build for anyone who would like a parts list that works without any fuss,"Hi Everyone:

  
I just wanted to report on my new build, which has been headache free and simple to put together (this is perhaps my 4th build in \~15 years). I typically keep my computers about 4-5 years and only upgrade the GPU \~2 years in. Primary use is gaming, video watching, browsing, productivity/creative software. Stress tested ram and CPU and memory separately for 2 hrs in OCCT, crystalmarked, and have played games and used it otherwise without a hitch. I know some people would want me to stress test it longer, but I havent OC'd the CPU and the ram is running at its basic XMP profile. 

  
AMD 9800x3d

x870e taichi (flashed to newest bios before installation of windows 11)

TeamGroup T-Force Xtreem DDR5, 7600MHZ, 38 cas, 2x24GB (48 total), running XMP profile in bios

6 Noctua G2 PWM fans (3 intake, 3 outtake)

Noctua NH-D15 G2 Cpu Cooler

Fractal Design Define 7 XL Case (removed all the Fractal fans and replaced with Noctua, above)

Seasonic Vertex px-1000w Platinum PSU

Crucial t700 NVME SSD Drive, 2GB, 5th Gen (pci-e 5.0) without heatsink (using MoBo heatsink)

PNY RTX 4070 Ti Super

  
Summary-

Extremely easy build - no surprises at all. I would have preferred the Nova or the Taichi lite, but this one was in stock and for the $50 higher price tag it was worth it to get it now rather than wait weeks and weeks. Thank god for Microcenter. The only thing I really didn't like about the x870e taichi was the lack of a user manual, and the fact that the online manual just isn't as detailed as it could be/should be. Not a huge fan of the quality of the Seasonic PSU cables (last build was a Corsair fully modular which had much nicer cables). I was very concerned about the ram situation given all the posts about the Gskill ram and wasn't sure what would work -- this one was listed on the QVL for memory and it works with the Intel XMP profile just fine. I didn't even know AM5 would allow for XMP profiles, so it was a surprise to me, as I thought I'd need to manually enter timings and voltages. Most people on here seem to encourage just purchasing a 6000mhz ram, but I figured I'm on an x870e board with a 9 series chip, may as well try for faster speeds. I only like gentle overclocks anyway - there is probably headroom in this system but I am not sure it's worth my time to figure out all of the details and the time to get everything stress tested after overclock modifications unless there was someone with an identical build that I could just copy their gentle overclock on the CPU. As for the GPU, this is the best sub $1000 GPU (my budget) I could find in stock. It's running about 50% faster than my 2080 Ti. The Crucial T700 5th gen SSD drive is running surprisingly cool on the x870e taichi heatsink -- even on the benchmarking it only reached 68 C. It is showing anywhere from 2x faster than my Corsair Force MP600 M.2 2280 1TB PCI-Express Gen 4.0 SSD drive on random read/writes, to 10x faster on sequentials. Temps across the board are VERY COOL with this case/fans and cable management.

In a year or so, once the dust has settled on the new GPU Nvidia 5 series cards, I plan to upgrade the GPU to a 5 series card. I have a 4k 27"" monitor and will be trying to get the new Asus 27"" OLED 4k monitor when it is released in a week and a half. Frame rates in some games have gone from 60FPS to 95FPS over my old build (Intel Coffee Lake, 2080ti)

  
LMK if you want any other info, or have any suggestions for easy overclock tweaks in the bios for the CPU (turn on TDP?).

Tonight I start over.,"I wanna cry, scream, and kick the ground. After seeing my urologist and finally getting properly diagnosed 5 years ago, it took maybe 2 years to finally get a routine and treatment that worked. Since then I was able to see my urologist once or twice a year. Every now and again I would get very tiny flares that I could fix with drinking more water and limiting caffeine and I was great. My biggest trigger was sex and I would get uti's every single time but then I was prescription and antibiotic I took only after sex. It was great I felt like I finally had my body back. No uti's after having one every other month was amazing. 2024 I think was the only year that I never had a uti once!!!! That's big progress!!!. So relieved it felt like I was in remission.

Last year my bf broke up with me. Being celibate has definitely helped my IC symptoms but I hate it. This year I had sex again for the first time in awhile. I did everything that I have always done and what worked for me in the past. But here I am 24 hours later and I'm devastated dealing with horrible symptoms. I have no words. I know I have a uti and I'm waiting until an urgent care opens in order to go. I was doing great for so long and I feel after all this time I have started over. 

This condition is unfair!!! I hate it and how it makes me feel. I deal with other horrible chronic conditions but this one tops the mother fing cake when it flares up I feel so broken. I suffer from migraines, ibs, pmdd and mental illness. But IC oh my god is it horrible and degrading in every way possible. Its so limiting and constricting. I'm so glad that I'm seeing a therapist weekly now because when my flares would get bad I would get so deep in the trenches mentally. What a way to start a new year just a big fat f u in my face.

Fuck you IC! I want to drink coffee and sodas and eat hot sauce and have sex and live my life and enjoy it  but I can't because of you!!!! Ugh!!!! ",6,1737436943.0,Interstitialcystitis,3,1.0,False
1i6beko,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i6beko,AIO // my best friend of 7 years is upset that i supposedly “made her” delete tiktok,"so to preface me and her (F 21) have been friends since freshman year of high school. we've been pretty inseparable since and do almost everything together. once college hit we stopped seeing each other as much as we used to but that didn't mean we weren't as close. to be quite honest i consider her my sister. yesterday amidst the
U.S. tiktok ban she wasn't able to access tiktok on her phone- i jokingly said that if she deletes it, she can get it back and access the app through the app store. this is considering i hadn't been aware that it was removed off the app store. again to put emphasis, it was a joke. we are pretty harsh with our jokes to one another and i would like to say that's due to the fact we've grown up with each other. so fast forward i told her this otp, we go to grab coffee and midst hanging out she picks up and leaves, im beyond confused trying to pinpoint what i would've done wrong and i genuinely did not know. she said bye very normally and it seemed like she was just busy at home. she then proceeds to text me about how upset she is that she actually deleted tiktok and how im a liar and a bad friend. ontop of that she blocks me, which we've had worse arguments and we've never resorted to blocking the other party, and unshared her location. also i attempted to call her in order to apologize but she was screaming on the phone and in tears so i lost the apology i originally had. i haven't responded since it left a really bad taste in my mouth considering ive done everything in my power to be a so called ""good friend,"" from always making time to see her, birthdays, going out, sleep overs, to even her being apart of my family- the list goes on. to give background i'm not a conditional or transactional person, i don't do things out of the desire for anything in return, nor do i measure the things i do or have done for people in my life. this is solely mentioned for others to understand the depth of our friendship. i don't know what to do- i don't want our friendship to end but i feel very disrespected.",2,1737436784.0,AmIOverreacting,20,0.67,False

We talked about getting married and adopting. He introduced me to his mom and I introduced him to my dad, which involved me coming out to both of my (religious) parents. 

Two days ago we were watching TikTok together on his phone while getting ready to go to a friend’s birthday party when I thought I saw a suspicious text from a name (Bill) I had never heard him mention before, but I didn’t see what it said because he swiped it away. 

I made a mental note to go through his iPad later, which is synced to his phone. He had told me his password. I have snooped once before 5 months ago but stopped when I saw how lovingly he talked about me to his friend. 

We get back from the birthday party around 1:00am and I pass out, but I woke up around 6:00am. 

I didn’t see any conversation between Bill and him. I assumed he deleted the message because the iPad should have synced to his phone and the message from Bill was not there, so I dug deeper for anything else. 

Scrolling down I found text exchanges between him and multiple unsaved numbers. He ghosted most of them. One of them was from while I was out of the country in India for work with a man (Dave) “from Sniffies” who appeared in his 40s from selfies he had sent. I didn’t know what Sniffies was, so I googled it and learned it was a cruising browser app. The texts were explicit. They planned on meeting. This was 5 hours after we had FaceTimed from across the world. I didn’t take screenshots, but I took a photo of the iPad with my camera. 

I waited for him to wake up and I played piano while he made himself a cup of coffee. When he came over to me I asked him about Bill. He said his Bill was his barber. He showed me his phone, and sure enough there were innocent texts from Bill planning on a scheduling a haircut. I asked him about Dave and Sniffies and he feigned confusion. He pretended to scroll through his phone, unable to find what I had already seen. 

I told him not to bother because I had them on my phone. I started reading back his text messages and had to stop. I asked him if they sounded familiar. He tried to explain it away by saying that he just used Sniffies for nudes and that he never actually hooked up with any of the people he was talking to. He readily offered me his phone with safari opened to the page. It wouldn’t load the page, so I bailed and opened SnapChat. He didn’t try to stop me. 

There he had conversations with multiple other men, some with nudes saved, dating back very early into our relationship. One of them was from the day of his best friend’s wedding, who he had given a speech for and had invited me as his plus one. I opened Instagram next and saw he was still talking to his ex. Nothing explicit there, but no mention of me or of having a boyfriend. 

I don’t believe he only wanted their nudes because he sent them his real selfie and phone number. I have no idea why he handed me his phone when there was so much more evidence beyond what I thought he had done, but the messages to Dave were already enough for me to break up. He grabbed some things then and is coming for the rest on Thursday. 

I’ve scheduled a test with an STD clinic. It’s stupid of me, but this is the second time I’m getting tested for him. The first time was two or three months into our relationship. I wanted to wait to hook up until he got tested for STDs but gave in before his results came back, assuming they’d have called him right away if anything came back positive. He ended up testing positive for Syphilis. I did not, luckily. I should have broken up with him then. 

Anyway, looking for a new Fortnite squad, I guess. I have him blocked on everything but text until he gets his things. I have all his photos in recently deleted but will delete them fully by the end of the week. ",1,1737436762.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1i6be6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoItaly/comments/1i6be6d/understanding_italian_attitudes_towards_work_and/,Understanding Italian attitudes towards work and leisure.,"## Understanding Italian Attitudes Towards Work and Leisure: A Dolce Vita Guide

Italy.  The land of pasta, art, and…a surprisingly complex relationship with work and leisure.  Forget the stereotype of perpetually sun-drenched siestas. While Italians certainly value their downtime, understanding their attitude towards work is key to navigating their culture and potentially even living there.

**The ""Dolce Vita"" Isn't Just a Movie:**

The phrase ""dolce vita"" (sweet life) isn't just a catchy title; it reflects a core cultural value.  Italians prioritize a balanced life, where work is important, but not at the expense of family, friends, and personal enjoyment. This doesn't mean they're lazy – far from it!  But they approach work with a different rhythm and perspective than many other cultures.

**Key Differences You'll Notice:**

* **Emphasis on Relationships:**  Building strong relationships, both personal and professional, is paramount.  Taking time to chat with colleagues, enjoy a coffee break together, and build rapport is considered an essential part of the workday. Don't be surprised by lengthy lunches or coffee breaks – these are crucial for fostering connections.

* **Family First:** Family time is sacred.  Expect work schedules to be flexible to accommodate family commitments.  This might mean shorter workdays or a more relaxed approach to deadlines, particularly during evenings and weekends.

* **Passion for Quality over Quantity:** Italians often prioritize quality of work over sheer quantity.  They strive for excellence and take pride in their craftsmanship, whether it's making pasta or designing a building.  This can lead to longer projects but with a superior outcome.

* **The Importance of ""Pausa"":**  The ""pausa"" – a break – isn't just a quick coffee run.  It's a vital part of the day, a time to recharge, connect with others, and enjoy life's simple pleasures.  Respecting these breaks is key to understanding the Italian work ethic.

* **The Value of Leisure:** Leisure time is not considered a luxury; it's a necessity.  Italians value downtime for socializing, pursuing hobbies, spending time with loved ones, and simply enjoying life's pleasures. This contributes to a greater sense of overall well-being.

**Navigating the Italian Workplace:**

If you're working in Italy or interacting with Italian businesses, remember:

* **Be Punctual:** While there's a relaxed approach to some aspects of work, punctuality for meetings and appointments is still expected.
* **Build Relationships:**  Invest time in getting to know your colleagues.  It's a crucial aspect of professional success.
* **Respect the ""Pausa"":** Don't interrupt during breaks. Embrace them as an opportunity to connect and understand the culture better.
* **Communicate Clearly:**  Direct and clear communication is essential, even within a relationship-oriented context.


**Beyond the Stereotype:**

The Italian attitude towards work and leisure is nuanced and far richer than simplistic stereotypes.  It's about finding a balance, valuing relationships, and appreciating the ""dolce vita"" – a lifestyle that prioritizes quality of life alongside professional success.  By understanding these key differences, you'll not only navigate Italian culture more effectively but also gain a deeper appreciation for this vibrant and passionate nation.
So, embrace the ""pausa,"" savor the moments, and enjoy the journey!

Greg and Rose were in their room, Rose was sitting at her desk on her laptop. Greg was sitting on a chair. She opened her Facebook, something that she does not do often and she got a message from Cartoon Network regarding her YouTube video back in June of 2008.

""Greg, look! I got a message on Facebook, it's from Cartoon Network regarding that video we took of Steven,"" she said

It has now been four years and a lot has happened to the Universe family, Rose finally got a loan and opened a bakery in Los Angeles. Greg opened a music store in Hollywood, They had a beautiful house in Beverley Hills. Both of them had amazing careers, and a beautiful life in LA, what could go wrong?

Then, they heard something in the living room. Rose grabs her sword, Greg follows her, and goes downstairs.

The design promotes a sense of spaciousness and is ideal for entertaining.

Expect to see soaring ceilings, often adorned with elegant chandeliers or modern light fixtures, creating a dramatic effect in the living and dining area.

Interiors would typically showcase high-end materials such as marble or hardwood flooring, custom cabinetry, and upscale finishes. Natural stone countertops in kitchens and bathrooms would be common.

The furniture would likely reflect a modern aesthetic, with clean lines and a mix of neutral tones and bold accents. Plush sofas, a nice coffee table, and statement art pieces would contribute to the luxurious feel.

Large glass doors and windows connect indoor spaces to outdoor areas, such as patios or decks, enhancing the California lifestyle. Outdoor living spaces might include lounges or dining areas.

Bathrooms would often feature soaking tubs, walk-in showers, and double vanities with high-end fixtures, creating a serene retreat.

With the rise of technology, many homes would incorporate smart home systems for lighting, climate control, and security, enhancing convenience and efficiency.

Their son—who was now eleven years old, was in the kitchen while Clarence, Jeff, and Sumo, were on the couch, the boys were now three years older than Steven.

The boys were playing on Steven's PlayStation, Steven was in the kitchen making Pop-Tarts for them. Steven screams as he sees his mother wielding her sword.

""Oh, it's just you!"" Rose said.

""Yeah, it's me! who do you think it was? the boogeyman?""

Rose put her sword in her scabbard and held it.

""Dude, What's wrong? You okay?"" Greg asked

""Yes, it was Sumo who screamed, Dad!"" he said, rolling his eyes.

""Sorry!"" Sumo said, holding the controller in his hands.

""That's okay, We thought that someone was hurt,"" he said, sighing in relief.

""Hey guys, why won't you guys get out of the house?"" Greg asked.

""Hey guys, let's go to our treehouse!"" Steven said.

""Yeah!"" Clarence said, as they all went and grabbed their bikes to ride there.

Steven was about to ride there when their neighbor walked out, Their neighbor was none other than Pearl.

""Steven!"" Pearl said, Steven looked at the tall gem.

""Yeah, pearl?""

""Where are you going?""

*Oh my stars, come on! can you get off my back?*

Steven tried not to roll his eyes at her then put on a smile. ""I'm going with Clarence, Jeff, and Sumo to our treehouse.""

""Okay, Steven. Make sure you ride safely,"" she told him. Steven tried not to roll his eyes again and he looked at her. ""I will be fine, Pearl! let's go guys,"" he said, riding with them to the treehouse.

…

Clarence, Jeff, Steven, and Sumo parked their bikes When they were about to go up. Steven's phone went off. He saw the caller ID was Ameythest.

""Hey, Ameythest!""

*""Hey, dude. Do you wanna come to my basketball game that's tonight? my mom can pick you up.""*

Steven's enthusiasm went way up. ""Sure! when is it?"" he said

*""It's at five thirty.""*

""Heck yes! I'll see you there!"" he said

*""Awesome, dude. I'll see you!""* Steven said goodbye to her then they all played.

Clarence, Sumo, Jeff, and Steven all went to grab ramen. They rode their bikes to the nearest one in LA and parked, Steven and his friends went inside the restaurant and got a table.

Steven and his friends all sat at a table, Steven got some lemonade and sushi. Same with his friends.

""Hey Steven, I have a question,"" Jeff said drinking his lemonade.

""What's up?""

""Why don't you age like us? your twelve right?"" Sumo asked the boy, Steven put a hand in his hair and nodded. ""Yeah?""

""Then, why aren't you growing like us?"" Clarence asked. Steven has not told them this before, not even in the four years that he's known them. ""Are you sure that you're twelve, Steven?""

""Yes, I'm twelve, but I'm part gem, so I age slower than other kids."" He said. his friends nod, and the waitress walks over and gives them their sushi.

""Thank you,"" Steven said, eating his sushi.

""Hey, Steven? You wanna come with us to the community pool tomorrow, my mom texted me if you want to come."" Clarence told him.

""Yeah!"" Steven said, raising his arms p.

""Let's do it, is your mom going to pick me up?"" Steven asked.

""Yeah, If you want to,"" he said. Steven nodded. ""Okay, this is gonna be so much fun!"" Sumo exclaimed.

""Yeah, It is!""

…

Steven was getting ready to go to Ameythest's game at her school. Steven walked down the stairs of the house, and Greg and Rose said yes that he could go. Steven went outside, zipped up his jacket and he went into her father's truck.

""Hey! Steven!"" Amethyst said. Giving him a fist bump.

""What's up?"" he asked, closing the door

""Fine,"" he said, Adrain drove off to her high school, Ameythest grabbed her CD and put it into the player that was in the car, and played some rock. Steven was jamming out to the song as they were driving.

Adrain parks at the parking lot and they go to the gym, they go to the building. Four other girls were out practicing. Her coach walks up.

Steven saw her basketball coach.

She is a passionate African American woman in her late 30s. She has a strong presence, standing tall with an athletic build, reflecting her years of playing and coaching the game. Her hair is styled in natural curls, often pulled back into a ponytail during practices and games.

Her coaching style is energetic and motivational, emphasizing teamwork, discipline, and hard work. She wears comfortable athletic gear, usually a branded team hoodie and basketball shorts, paired with sneakers that allow her to move quickly on the court.

Off the court, she is known for her engaging personality and dedication to mentoring her players, instilling confidence and resilience in them. She often organizes community events to foster support for the team and promotes inclusivity and empowerment among young female athletes in the area. Her leadership is not just about winning games but also about building character and community.

""Well, guess who decided to join us."" Her coach said.

""Sorry, Coach. Talia.""

""Get into your uniform, alright, We starting soon."" She nodded and walked to the locker room.

""Let's sit Steven,"" Adrain said, walking him to the bleachers and they found a space to sit and watch.

""Why is basketball season so late? I thought It was in November. Where in March.""

""Her last game is tonight, Steven.""

""Oh, okay,"" he said as he watched the game.

""THE AGOURA HILLS BLAZE WIN!"" The commentator said, jumping from his seat. Steven smiled and clapped for her team.

…

Steven was now back home, he hopped out of the shower, went out, and looked around his bedroom.

The walls are painted in a vibrant red or adorned with posters of his favorite bands, and the NBA team—The Los Angeles LAKERS with his favorite player Kobe Bryant, some Justice League, and Captain America posters were also on the walls.

He also had a full-sized bed for sleepovers with Clarence, Jeff, and Sumo, often covered with a fun, themed bedspread. A desk was present, cluttered with school supplies and books.

The floor was strewn with toys, action figures, or sports gear, reflecting his hobbies. A bookshelf might showcase a mix of novels, comic books, and trophies from sports or other achievements.

Lighting could come from a bedside lamp shaped like a character—In this case, was Batman.

I've been on the ""self-improvement"" grind for about 5-6 years now in an effort to recover from CPTSD and to make up for my lack of proper role modeling and mentorship in my youth. I've taken various courses, seen multiple therapists, read many books, and followed many content creators. I feel I'm on the tail end of this journey now and I wanted to share something I keep seeing on various self-development-oriented forums, including this one. 

I repeatedly see posts like ""I want to do \_\_\_\_ but I feel like \_\_\_\_"" or ""I'm supposed to feel \_\_\_\_ but instead I feel \_\_\_\_"" or ""I am \_\_\_\_, how do I feel good about it?"" 

Firstly, if you have a personality disorder, significant trauma, or some other mental ailment which compromises the way you experience emotions, that would be the first thing to figure out and what I'm saying here likely doesn't apply to you. However, if you've sorted out your mental illnesses (or you have none) and you still find yourself asking these questions, I think there's a more productive line of thinking you can pursue. 

When you have a certain emotion and you dislike it, that emotion isn't the real problem. The problem is how reactive you are to yourself. It's like if fire alarms were set off by the sound of other alarms; your morning alarm could go off and all of a sudden there's a cacophony of panic in the building that has nothing to do with a fire. 

In the same way, if you're so reactive to your own emotions, any emotion you feel is going to throw you off track and it may be totally unnecessary. For example, I used to sometimes wake up tired and then I would start thinking: ""Why am I so tired? I'm always so weak. Oohh I'm not supposed to feel this way! How am I supposed to do anything when I feel like this? I hate myself!"" None of that was necessary. I could just think: ""Man, I feel tired today. Well, gotta get to work."" Done, that's as simple as it needs to be. Just because I feel a bit tired in the morning doesn't mean I'm weak or I won't be able to do anything. It's literally just a feeling that everyone has when you wake up in the morning. Chill. Maybe eat a little more or get some coffee to help boost your energy. Find an action around it but there's no need to set off more emotions in reaction to this one.

This is where people might think: ""But how come I can't think like that? It's not that simple for me because I do hate myself and it is overwhelming. How do I feel differently?"" Now you're back to square one. My point is you don't bother trying to feel differently. You feel whatever you feel and move on with your life anyways. It takes willpower. You won't always succeed in the sense that sometimes you will give into your emotions and stay in bed (for example) or let your anxiety get the better of you. When you do this, you take away a lesson for what you could do differently and/or lower your goals. And then you keep persisting. It takes willpower but start wherever you can and build it up. 

**TLDR:** stop reacting to every little emotion you feel within you, reacting to one emotion by setting off more emotions (like shame, anger, panic, etc.) isn't going to help you. Commit yourself to feeling whatever emotion comes up and moving forward in life anyways. Life becomes much simpler this way (think of how much time and energy you waste dwelling on your feelings when there's actually nothing in particular stopping you from making progress). Maintain awareness of your thoughts and feelings because they give you information but don't live in your head so much.",5,1737435820.0,Healthygamergg,1,0.78,False

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!weaponizing therapeutic language, domestic and physical abuse!< 

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/g2ItH6JaH2) **May 13, 2024** 

This morning I woke up early to order myself coffee so he could take our son to pick it up and “surprise” me. Then they went to the grocery store and thoughtfully picked out my favorite breakfast and came home. 

My husband made half of the breakfast and then asked me to make the other half. No problem. He acknowledged that he was asking me to do the work and still taking credit for the benefit of our kids’ experience and memories. 

It WAS no problem until he went upstairs to “go to the bathroom” and after 45 minutes I walked upstairs to check on him and he was asleep in our bed. He slept the entire afternoon. 

Later that day I was doing the absolute mountain of dishes (my third load for the day, that’s another story) and he asked me to make a grocery list. I asked if he could please make the list because I am in the middle of doing the dishes, and further tried to coax him by using Mother’s Day in a playful way. I really didn’t want to drop what I was doing to look in the fridge he was already standing right in front of to tell him what we needed for dinner. He knows what the ingredients are, he could easily look himself, but he insisted I “help” him. I was super frustrated so I took a deep breath, washed and dried my hands, and then opened the fridge and started telling him what we need. 

He could sense my frustration and called me on it. I explained that I was really hoping he could make a list himself just this once because I was in the middle of doing the dishes. I explained that when I make a grocery list I just look at what we have and write down what we don’t have, and I didn’t understand why he NEEDED my help. He started talking over me to say if I had a problem making a grocery list with him I should just have told him. I told him that I DID communicate that with him, he doubled down and told me that I need to learn some patience. 

I smiled and said “Happy Father’s Day,” because it was the nicest thing I could think to say. That completely set him off. He went off on me, refused to get ingredients to make our dinner, bought dinner for only himself and our kids, and has been giving me the silent treatment for over an hour. He says I went too far. AITAH? 

ETA: wow, I did not realize I was going to wake up to so much to read. Thank you for all of your feedback. I have been enjoying my self-brewed coffee this morning and taking in your responses. I have a lot to look over and think about. I know divorce is the obvious answer. 

Edit 2: 

No, divorce isn’t the obvious answer for this specific incident. (Edit: 3- I mean the idea of divorce is not solely based on this one specific incident. Several people have commented thinking everyone is jumping to divorce based on this one situation. It is more complex than this one day.) 

No, I’m not using Reddit as a poll for whether or not to leave my marriage. 

TIL how to make Reddit paragraphs. 

Both of our mothers are dead unfortunately. 

Our children are 6 and under. It is common for parents to help and facilitate the day. 6 year olds and toddlers can’t be responsible for celebrating their parents. I didn’t “expect” anything from him. I know it’s just a Hallmark Consumerism holiday. 

People who have commented are correct in saying that this incident is just representative of every other day, but magnified by the fact that Mother’s Day was a particularly shitty day to choose to be particularly shitty. 

I felt like maybe I was TA for making the petty comment. I am ND and sometimes I have trouble picking up on if I did something wrong that I maybe didn’t realize was wrong to say or do. 

I appreciate all of the anecdotes of your strength and ability to move forward after leaving an exhausting marriage. It is inspiring. 

Edit/ Answers to your questions / Update 4: 

Since Sunday I have not lifted a single finger for Baby Sinclair (my internal nickname for him). Unless it directly impacts our kids, every time he requests my help or to do something for him that he can do himself I just use my absolute sweetest voice let him know he doesn’t need my help and I believe in his ability to complete the task himself. Then I smile and walk away. The third time I did this, he said I was making him uneasy. I could not help but to LOL, which made him announce that he felt more uneasy. 

I know it wasn’t kind, but I calmly told him he is a pathetic human. I told him I’m sorry it has to be me, but someone in his life needs to tell him to grow the fuck up. I told him I care about him and I love him but I will not tolerate being treated with disrespect even one more day. He said I am abusive. The actual audacity…! 

I spared the divorce conversation (for safety and because I have said many times before I want to leave and financially it isn’t possible right now.). 

Side note: I tried to leave last year because he was making me feel unsafe and his behavior was erratic. I went to the emergency room in a mental breakdown and told them about the abuse, which they noted in detail on my file. They asked about any plans to escape and I told them I had it covered, and answered their questions about my plan. I had been planning for our escape for a year leading up to this. They told me they had to document the reported abuse in my file. I asked them to check my chart to make sure it is not tied to his account. They looked at it in front of me and said they “made sure” he wasn’t on my emergency contacts or attached to my chart in any way…but then guess who got an email with my chart notes detailing his abuse and my exit plan before I even got home? 

I had to cool things down and start over with a new plan that I kept entirely to myself. At this point though, he knew I had saved up money to leave so most of my savings was depleted within a couple of months. 

I eventually left with our kids with far less savings and it didn’t take long for me to realize I could not sustain the cost of my original bills (still in my name) and new bills in addition to legal assistance and the overall cost of starting over. 

Our leaving caused him to spiral and he went back to therapy. Soon after, we started to dip our toes into visiting each other (mostly because I didn’t want to leave our kids with him). We stuck to outdoor public activities as a family. He has always been able to wear me down and talk me out of a divorce, and this ended up no differently. 

Even though I know I’m not an anomaly, I felt ashamed and like a complete failure for going back. 

Surprisingly, he never actually changed ( / s). 

(End of side note) 

Anyway, back to present day: I began to grey rock to throw off his cycle of attempting to rope me back into the argument from the other day. I have calmly listened to him gush over his love for our family, and how much he loves and appreciates me and thinks I am an amazing mom. He says he loves me but all I hear in my head is his voice screaming “fucking bitch” at me. It all sounds so obviously disingenuous. I told him his words mean literally nothing while his behavior is the same. It’s like saying waffles have legs… it sounds unbelievable and if I don’t see it with my own eyes, I’m not believing it. I told him regardless of if in the end we stay together or not, we need to go back to therapy as a duo and separately. I told him he needs to take steps today to move forward with therapy and treating his mental health appropriately. He agreed, but no evidence of walking waffles yet. 

I am surprised at my ability to completely refuse to do anything he can do himself. I’m more surprised that he’s actually doing the tasks himself. I have tried this before and he ultimately bullies me into doing the task. Not this time. He keeps complaining about his results in ways that are so juvenile and manipulative, always leaving the impression that if I had just done it for him it would have been done correctly. I just smile and tell him he did a good job with the task and tell him that it sounds like he needs more practice and eventually it will become second nature. I am feeling his attempts to make me miserable, but it is rolling right off of me. At least for now. 

I cannot express enough how much I appreciate the support and validation here. I appreciate the married people who have shared what their day was like on Sunday (and everyday) as a healthy couple. 

For those of you who have asked why I am taking to the internet with this in the first place: 

I have been isolated from my circle for so long my relationships no longer exist. I have limited family period, and no family nearby. My mom is dead. My dad sucks. My siblings mostly suck. I have no friends. I work virtually and don’t have friendships with my coworkers because we rarely socialize and have opportunities to bond. I don’t have opportunities to interact with adults very often. Isn’t that the beauty of the internet? Despite my logical brain, years of gaslighting along with my Neurodivergence have made it sometimes feel impossible to trust my own judgment. 

If you are offended by me posting this and have taken the time to voice your disgust for me and my post, I just want to let you know I have processed your complaints and directed them to the correct department. Thank you for your feedback. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/pAvq7t9Wrt) **June 12, 2024** 

A lot has happened since my original post. 

First, since Mother’s Day he has not shown any sort of attempts for progress (surprise). He has lost his control and repeatedly called me a fcking btch and other awesome pet names for his minor irritations towards me- example: I asked him if he wanted my help bringing in groceries. Apparently he wanted to do it himself to let me relax, and my offering ruined his plan so he was essentially throwing an adult version of a tantrum. I explained that it doesn’t feel like a genuine gesture especially because now I’m being yelled at for… offering to help? L-O-L! Okay, pal. 

At one point I became petty (whoops) and told him to use “I statements” because that’s his go-to “therapy speak” that he uses on me as a dog whistle during arguments and therapy appointments. He lost his shit, which then made me laugh because I literally do not understand if this is really his perception of reality. I can’t take him seriously. I find myself laughing more now than ever, and it’s not to mock him I just can’t control my disbelief and don’t know how else to cope at this point. 

Second, I have realized that while I do love and care about him it is clear that he does not respect me as a person, a mother, or his partner. He doesn’t respect our kids. I can’t realistically continue living with someone who tries to control my entire life. What kind of life is that to live? 

I took advice from many comments left on my original post and reached out to friends and family I had been isolated from. The reception was better than I anticipated. I didn’t expect the hurt I felt when I found out every single one of them said they wondered if I was in an abusive marriage, but not one of them ever asked me directly when I completely withdrew. I don’t blame them, but It was hard to ignore the pain I felt from that. This was also a reason I never reached out to anyone when things got really bad. It seemed like they have their own lives to worry about and clearly weren’t concerned about my absence. 

A couple of the people I reached out to were lifelong friends that I had to formally end friendships with when I started dating my husband because of his jealousy, and I never got to mourn those friendships. It felt like a piece me that had been broken began to heal. 

Anyway, it was a positive step because some of my family members were relieved I opened up to them and now I don’t feel so isolated and alone. So thank you to everyone who encouraged me to do that. 

4- I am not sure what my next steps are but I am feeling more confident in my path forward. I do know that from here on out I’m doing whatever the fuck I want (DW, as safely as I can) 

Thank you!

>>>Edit: I think the pain I felt really had nothing to do with my friends and family and everything to do with the fact that I felt like I was crazy for so long. I thought everyone thought he was a great person. My pain was partly disappointment in myself for not seeing what everyone else saw.

##**NEW UPDATE**
*

[Update  246 Days Later.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/ctIBN6ZKGJ)  **Jan 14, 2025**

246 days ago I posted asking “AITAH for telling my husband Happy Father’s Day today because it felt like I was doing it all alone today?” 

I knew I was in an abusive marriage, but I was stuck. I continued to be stuck until it escalated beyond return. I wanted to update to show how things can escalate. The very next month after my original post, he pushed me down backwards on the stairs. The month after that, he started threatening his life if I didn’t stay with him. The month after that, he started looking into buying a gun. The month after that, he was physically extremely violent to me in front of our kids and emotionally violent towards them. Police were called multiple nights in a row. 

My kids and I have been staying at someone else’s house since mid November. We left with a weekend’s worth of clothes each, toothbrushes, and some of their favorite toys that I could quickly grab. We are starting completely over and it feels VERY weird. From my previous post, he drained the savings I had accumulated to escape with my kids. I am in the process of finding a new job and have a GFM open as a desperate attempt at leaning on community. As weird and scary as this process has been I have never felt safer. My kids have never been happier.

If they did that why haven’t you reached out to a lawyer yet?? That would be my first step going forward!

I don't eat junk food, rarely desserts (maybe once a week). I eat whole foods, all prepared in my kitchen, but still, I am overweight. 

So I decided to prepare meal plans which would be very low calories but also rich in protein and nutrients. I was eating over 100 grams of protein a day on 1200 calories. So it looked something like a few mugs of coffee with milk (probably 3 cups of milk) with a small dash of maple syrup, salmon fillet with 1/4 cup of Greek yogurt and a drizzle of olive oil with salt for lunch. A burger patty with cottage cheese and a side salad with yogurt dressing for dinner. That was it. If I got hungry in the evening I had to just deal or maybe have a little milk. 

I also was running for about 20 mins every other day on the treadmill, burning 200 calories and then weight lifted 3 times a week. 

So yeah, after about 2 -3 weeks, I lose 5 lbs. 

Which is great!

But I got lazy with measuring and counting calories and macros, and my weight loss has stalled. I can't eat more than 1300 calories a day or I'm done. As for the exercise, I will likely end up gaining weight if I'm not careful. I had a piece of toast with peanut butter this evening, and yeah, that's all it takes! 

Anyways, just sharing. I have to get back on the horse I guess. I'm 159, but I have around  20 lbs to go. ",17,1737435487.0,PetiteFitness,12,0.9,False

# Lavazza Qualità Rossa: My Top Pick

Lavazza is a classic for a reason. Its balanced mix of Arabica and Robusta beans delivers a smooth, slightly nutty flavor with a hint of chocolate. I love how versatile it is—it works beautifully in every brewing method I’ve tried, from my espresso machine to a French press.

# Illy Classico Ground Coffee: Best for Premium Taste

Illy is renowned for its high-quality 100% Arabica blends. The subtle sweetness and balanced acidity make it perfect for Moka pots or filter brewing. Plus, the vacuum-sealed tin keeps the coffee incredibly fresh, so every cup tastes like it was just ground.

# Taylors of Harrogate Rich Italian: Best for Bold Flavor

For those who love bold, full-bodied coffee, Taylors’ Rich Italian blend is a standout. The medium-dark roast enhances its depth, making it perfect for strong espressos or indulgent lattes. It’s also a great choice for cafetières, producing a rich and aromatic cup.

# My Tips for Choosing Ground Coffee

* **Flavor Preference:** Look for smooth and balanced options like Lavazza, or opt for bold and rich blends like Taylors.
* **Brewing Method:** Choose the right grind size for your setup—fine for espresso, medium for drip coffee, and coarse for French presses.
* **Roast Level:** Medium roasts are versatile, while darker roasts deliver stronger, more robust flavors.
* **Freshness:** Airtight packaging, like Illy’s tins, helps preserve the coffee’s aroma and taste.
* **Origin and Blend:** Single-origin beans offer unique flavors, while blends provide a balanced cup.

# My Recommendation

For UK coffee lovers, **Lavazza Qualità Rossa** is the best all-around choice for its versatile flavor and affordable price. If you’re after a premium, refined taste, **Illy Classico Ground Coffee** offers unparalleled quality and freshness.

Usually I get a pop up on checkout to let me know I earned a coffee, but today I spent over $50 and there was no pop up. Is there a way to see if you've earned one in the app? I tried asking the bot in the app but it wasn't very helpful.

1i6auth,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1i6auth/third_spaces/,Third Spaces,"Hi everyone! This is not really related to anything, but something I really do lament about our generation is the loss of third spaces. Especially not athletic third spaces - I feel like sports and run clubs have grown in popularity due to their ability to serve as a third space and be a productive use of time, but sometimes you don’t want to workout.

I wish that libraries and coffee shops and bowling alleys were still places you could go and meet people. I understand that one can obviously still go to these places, but if a stranger (even if they were your age and seemed normal) tried to introduce themselves to you, you would be freaked out and try to leave that situation as soon as possible. 

The internet has taken over that third place and become the digital town square, and in a lot of cases, that’s so cool! There’s going to be people who read this post who I would’ve have never had an interaction with otherwise, but there’s something about a physical in person connection. I feel like the pendulum may be shifting back as people are starting to shy away from social media and step back from dating apps, so I’m a bit hopeful! 

Edit: please let me know if you have any suggestions for activities or places that could serve as third spaces or any ideas for things that could become third spaces!",1,1737434859.0,GenZ,6,0.6,False
1i6aus0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1i6aus0/who_am_i_short_story_3294_words/,Who Am I? (Short Story) (3294 words) ,"I wake up each morning with the same routine. The sunlight filters through the blinds, just like always, casting the same shadows on my floor as the last 50 years I have been in this beautiful house. I stretch, letting the warmth of the sun settle on my skin for a moment before slipping out of bed. I shuffle my way toward the kitchen, to get the kettle ready. After a little while, the kettle boils, and I make my coffee, the steam rising from the cup as I carry it to the kitchen table. 

I have so much time now, after retiring. Back then there was always a rush, the mornings a flurry of getting the kids to school, getting ready for work. I worked in accounting, managing numbers and reports, and this kept me busy oftentimes not noticing how late it had gotten. I loved the quiet of the evening after a long day, the house still, children tucked in, and I had time to unwind. I did a good job in my opinion. My children are both successful. I’d bet my beloved Mildred would be proud of how I handled them. 

Now it’s just me, the house, and outside that passes by at its own pace. After my coffee is cooled, I grab the newspaper and make my way outside to the porch to sit and watch the neighborhood come alive. It is then that I start to think about things that I might need to have done around this house that my frail body is unable to do along with the tasks that I can do- watering the plants, fixing that loose door handle, maybe even calling one of my daughters, Sarah or Emily. They are twins, Sarah just a few minutes older. 

After I finish my coffee, I rinse the cup and leave it in the sink to dry. The house is quiet, but I don’t mind. I’ve never needed a ton of noise to keep me company. I grab my notepad from the counter, and glance at the list I made from yesterday. 

It read, “Water the plants, tighten the hinge on the pantry door, call both Sarah and Emily.” 

I head to the living room first, where the ferns by the window sit. The watering can is tucked near the back door. As I pour the water into the pots, the sunlight filtering through is casting delicate patterns on the floor. It reminds me of when the girls were small and they used to make shadow puppets in this room, giggling at the shapes their hands could make.

Afterward, I head to the pantry to take care of that door, the hinge has been squeaking for weeks, driving me up the wall. I grab my toolbox from the garage, find the right screwdriver, and get to work. It’s a simple fix, but it gave me a sense of accomplishment. 

By mid-morning, I’m ready for a break. I take a seat in the armchair by the window, the same one I’ve had for quite some time, and I relax. The neighborhood is alive now. A couple walks their dog down the street, a boy pedals on his bike, and somewhere I hear the faint sound of a lawnmower. It’s a good day. 

I awake at around noon from my little nap. By late afternoon, the house feels even quieter. I decide it is a good time to call one of the girls. It’s been a few days since I’ve talked to Sarah, so I dial her number on my phone. It rings a couple times before her voice answers.

“Hi, Dad!” she says, her voice lifting my spirits.

“Hi, sweetheart,” I reply, leaning back in the chair. “How’s your day going?”

We talk about her work-something in marketing that I’ve never quite understood but still ask about-and her kids. She tells me about how my grandson scored a goal at his soccer game last weekend and that they plan to visit me soon. 

“Emily mentioned she’d stop by this weekend too,” she adds.

“That’ll be nice,” I say. I mean it, but I don’t linger on the thought too much. It’s always better when they come over. 

After we hung up, I think about calling Emily too. She’s always been a night owl, so I’ll just wait until after dinner. 

For my dinner I just have some soup and crackers. I haven’t ever been much of a cook, knowing what Mildred taught me before she passed and a few other basic things, but I learned to get by. The kitchen is dimly lit, and the hum of the fridge keeps me company as I eat. After I clean up and make my way back to the living room, it is already nighttime. I’ve never gotten used to this daylight savings idea. I sit in my chair and dial Emily’s number.

The phone rings four times until she answers with a warm and tired voice. I assume I must have woken her up. 

""Hey, Dad.”

""Hi, Em,” I say. “How’s everything going?” 

She tells me about her latest painting project and how she’s been thinking about visiting the old family cabin for inspiration. I tell her she’s welcome and that it might be a little dusty. It’s been years since anyone’s been up there. After we say goodbye, I sit for a while, letting the remaining daylight settle over me.

Before bed, I grab my book from the table by the armchair. It’s a mystery novel I’ve been working through for weeks now, the kind that’s easy to get lost in. My eyes grow heavy after just a few pages and I set my book mark in the page, setting it on the night stand. I turn off the lamp and listening to the faint creaks of the house. I think about Mildred for a moment before sleep takes me. I don’t dwell on it too much. It isn’t a sadness anymore, not entirely. It’s just a quiet thought at this point. I miss her, but it has been around 30 years since the accident. I’ve kept my promise and stayed alone. I think again, ‘I’d bet Mildred is proud of how I’ve grown and raised these girls.’ 

That was the last thought in my mind. Darkness fills my mind until I wake up in the morning and repeat the beautiful cycle. Steady and simple, just the way I like it. 

*One year later.* 

The morning starts like any other. The sunlight filters through the blinds, casting the same shadows as the last 50 years. I stretch, get out of bed, and make my way to the kitchen, the soft hum of the kettle a comfort as I prepare my coffee.

I stand at the counter, the steam rising from the mug in my hands, but for the life of me, I can’t remember if I added the sugar. I stir it anyway, tasting it to check. No, I didn’t. I gag. I add the sugar and stir away, tasting it again to alleviate the disgust I am feeling. I frown at the cup, as though it might give me an answer. It’s such a small thing, that shouldn’t have unsettled me. I mean I’ve forgotten countless things before. \*‘It might just be my age catching up to me,’\* I jokingly think to myself. Most likely just a moment of distraction.   
  
Later, as I water the plants by the window, I catch myself staring at the fern for too long. Something about its leaves seems odd. \*Did I always have this one? Or was it the other kind?\* My hand hovers over the watering can, and I shake my head. It’s silly to think this way. Of course it’s the same fern. I’ve had these since the girls graduated from college.   
  
The phone rings in the early afternoon. Sarah is calling. I pick up.  
  
“Hi, Dad! Just checking in, how are you?”  
  
“Good, good. How are the kids?”  
  
As she talks, I listen. I might have missed a few words but I understand what she’s saying and I know what to say. The conversation was nice. It helped me not dwell on that coffee incident.   
  
When we hang up, I sit back in my chair, and stare out the window. I used to be so sharp, but now at this age, my senses are dulling. It's probably just my age. It’s normal with age.   
  
In the evening, I call Emily. She couldn’t talk long but enjoyed the short time we had. She told me she is going up to the family cabin to get more ideas for a new painting. After we hang up, I decide to pick up my book. It’s the sequel to the one I finished about a couple months ago. But as I flip through the pages, I don’t remember what happened in the last chapter. I turn back a few pages, to refresh my memory. It feels like I’m recalling a dream. Impossible to pin anything down.  
  
Frustrated, I close the book and set it aside. As I drift off into sleep I think about Mildred. I’ve forgotten her face. It kind of hurts but I remember everything else about her. That’s good, right?

*One year later.*

I still wake up to the same sunlight filtering through the blinds, but now, it doesn’t feel the same. It takes me longer to get out of bed these days, and when I do, I have to pause and think about what comes next. Coffee first, right?

The kettle isn’t on the counter where it should be. I search the cupboards muttering to myself, until I finally find it under the sink of all places. ‘Why would I put it there?’ I shake my head and laugh, a little uneasy but I chalk it up to being distracted. That seems to be my excuse for everything now.   
  
When the coffee is ready, I sit at the kitchen table, staring at the notepad. The words look strange. “Call Sarah and Emily,” it says, but I can’t remember if I already did. I dial Emily’s phone this time. She might be on her way back from her workplace. She answers on the second ring. “Hi, dad!”  
  
“Hi sweetheart,” I say, trying to sound cheerful. “I just wanted to check in. How are you?”  
  
“I’m good. We just talked yesterday though, remember?”  
  
I pause. I don’t remember. My hand tightens around the phone as I try to think of something to say.  
  
“Oh,” I manage, laughing nervously. “Well it doesn’t hurt to check twice, does it?”  
  
She laughs too, “No, it doesn’t,” she says. We talk for a few more minutes before hanging up.   
  
When I set the phone down, the uneasiness creeps back in. I feel like I’m forgetting things more often, like the days are blurring together. I can’t tell if its just the routine.   
  
In the afternoon, I go to water the plants. The fern by the window has grown unruly, its leaves spreading out over the floor. I need to trim it. I grab the watering can but as I reach for it, I hesitate.  
  
Wasn’t I just here? Didn’t I water this already?  
  
I look down at the plant then at my hands, confused. The watering can feels heavy. I set it down and back away, my chest tight. I sit in the chair to try and relax.  
  
Evenings are harder now. I try to read but the words move along the pages. I flip back and forth, trying to find where I left off, but nothing is making sense. I set the book aside, frustrated. In my chair, I watch the streetlights come on. The world goes quiet.  
  
I think about calling Sarah, but I stop myself. What if I already called her today? Or was that yesterday? I call anyway. She answers and we talk for a while. She mentions that I did call her that morning after I called Emily. I tell her I must just be tired. I make my way to bed.  
  
As I drift off, I think of Mildred. My beloved. I can’t recall many of the memories but I remember the good ones. Our first kiss, date, my proposal, our wedding, everything good. And just as I fall asleep, I remember seeing her in the casket at her funeral. It leaves a melancholic feeling in my chest as I continue to drift off. 

*Two years pass.*

Mornings are harder now. I still wake up with the sunlight filtering through the blinds, but it takes longer to piece together where I am. The shadows on the floor seem wrong somehow. I sit on the edge of the bed, staring at the dresser. Just a dresser.  
  
I shuffle to the kitchen, hoping the smell of Coffee would help. The kettle is on the counter this time, but when I grab it, the handle feels too smooth. I blink and shake my head. The motions are automatic as I make the coffee. But when I take a sip it tastes disgusting. I forgot the sugar again… I think. I can’t tell anymore.   
  
The phone rings while I sit at the table. I answer.  
  
“Hi Dad!” It's Sarah.  
  
“Hello,” I say but my voice sounds off.  
  
There’s a pause on the other end. “How are you feeling today?”   
  
“I’m fine,” I reply, but even I can hear how hollow the words are. I feel anything but fine.   
  
She tells me about her day, about the kids and their upcoming projects. I try to keep up but her words blur together, fragments slipping through my mind before I can hold onto them. At one point I am just nodding to silence. She’s waiting for my response but I don’t know what to say.   
  
“I’m sorry,” I say finally, “what were you saying again?”  
  
Her voice softens. “That’s okay, Dad. It wasn’t very important.”  
  
But it feels important to me. It feels like everything is slipping from me and I can’t stop it.  
  
I go for a walk in the afternoon. As I step outside, the world is different. The air is heavier, and the streets are long. The houses are stretching into shapes I don’t recognize. I walk slowly, my steps uneven, and glance around, trying to orient myself. There’s a house with a blue door that I think I should know.  
  
Further down, a dog barks from a yard, its sound sharp and jarring. I feel lost.  
  
I turn back sooner than I planned but when I reach my front door, my chest tightens. Is this the right house? The numbers look strange. I stand for a moment, unsure, until I finally push it open. Inside, the walls feel too close. I sit down in my armchair, my heart racing. I calm myself.   
  
Evening brings even more confusion. I’ve given up on trying to read. I’m disappointed because I think I really enjoyed that series of books. I see a picture of Sarah and Emily when they were young, standing in front of the family cabin. I pick it up, holding it close, but the faces don’t seem right. The harder I look, the more the features blue, until it feels like I’m looking at strangers. I set it down quickly, my hands trembling.  
  
The phone rings. It’s Emily and I answer.  
  
“Hi dad,” She says, “How was your day?”  
  
“I went for a walk,”  
  
“That’s good, did you see anything interesting?”  
  
I pause, trying to remember. The street, what else? It’s all jumbled now.  
  
“Not much,” I say finally.  
  
We don’t talk long. After we hang up, I sit in the dark, staring at the shadows on the walls. They move in ways that don’t make sense. I close my eyes hoping sleep will come quickly.   
  
As I drift, I think of Mildred. It hurts. All I remember of her is the image of her in the casket. It creates a pain in my chest. I start to cry as I fall asleep. 

*Two years pass.*

I wake up to the sound of voices. They’re low, murmuring, just outside the bedroom door. I strain to hear them, but they slip away. The house feels heavy, the air thick like it’s pressing down on me. I make my way to the kitchen. It’s dark. I stand for what seems like forever, unsure of what I was trying to do. The kettle is on the counter. I don’t know what it’s for. My hands tremble.   
  
The phone rings and I jump. I answer.  
  
“Dad? Are you there?” It’s one of my daughters, I think. It feels like it’s coming from miles away too.   
  
I try to answer. “I–uh, yeah, yeah, I’m here.”  
  
There’s a pause, I can hear the concern in her voice. “How are you feeling today?”   
  
“I’m fine,” I say automatically, but that couldn’t be farther from the truth.  
  
“Emily and I were talking about coming to visit this weekend,” she says. “Does that sound good?”   
  
“Visit?” The word feels foreign, like I’ve never heard it before. I don’t know what she means. “Yes. Yes, of course.”  
  
When we hand up, I stare at the phone. I can’t remember what I was doing with the phone.   
  
I don’t know what time it is. The clock ticks, the hands don’t make sense. The sun moves. Is it morning? Afternoon? I sit in the chair. There is a picture on the coffee table. I pick it up and stare at it, but the faces don’t mean anything to me. Two younger women, smiling, standing in front of a cabin. Both of them look familiar. I try to remember but I can’t. I set it down. My head hurts. I wander through the house but nothing feels right. The rooms are too big, too small, too dark. I don’t know what I’m looking for. At some point I find myself in a big room with a chair that I like to sit in. I hear voices, low and distinct. I can’t tell where they are coming from.   
  
“Mildred? Are you back from work already?” I say. I don’t know who Mildred is.   
  
No answer.   
  
I don’t remember how I got to my bed. If this is even my bed. I sleep.  
  
As I drift off, I see a woman. I don’t know who she is. Just a woman in a casket. I don’t know what this feeling is. I fully fall asleep before I can put my finger on it. 

*Two more years pass.*

Hello, this is a story about a man named Elliot. He has dementia. This covers the exact same day in certain years. So It says one year later, it means exactly one year later. Example (January 3rd, 2024. One year later. January 3rd 2025.) Very simple but I just want to clear it up. Second he starts off at 73. His daughters are 36 and are twins. His wife died when the girls were 6. I also want to clear the end up because it might not make sense. So his daughters move in to take care of him after they visit him and see his condition. Then the last section is him barely able to formulate thoughts so he is making that transition from one stage to the last stage. He gets to the last stage at 81 and remains in that stage until his death at 83. He is basically a vegetable without life support for that period of time. I tried my best to make it show that he is descending from the beginning by not mentioning his name implying that he doesn't know his name and that was the first thing to leave his mind. I got inspiration from a documentary about dementia and from The Caretaker's albums on You tube. Very surreal listen if you sit for all of them. All of that aside, I hope whoever reads this enjoys reading it. I really worked hard to try and make it seem like he was going through stages of dementia or Alzheimer's. Also I put this message at the end because I didn’t want to give the whole plot away at the beginning. Thank you for reading.",2,1737434855.0,stories,2,1.0,False

Other things I've been trying.

\-  I take ibuprofen. Tried colchicine but had a bad reaction so I stopped.

\- Red light therapy. (This seems to help a tiny bit)

\- Supplements, Vitamin D, fish oil, turmeric, (& adding cinnamon to morning oatmeal.)

\-Drink chamomile tea before bed as it is also anti inflammatory.

Especially in Canada no matter what you do or contribute to the economy, people will still hate you. I told the truth. Days have passed since I have not faced any racism. I step out people give me death stares. I stand in a line and order a coffee, staff are rude and pathetic to me but are nice to others. I have always been nice to everyone, greeted everyone, am polite always but why are you rude specially to me? And its normalized which is what hurts me. Sure there is huge immigration backlash right now and i get it and i as an immigrant who is suffering from scammers too, but people dont care about it. Cherry on top, im gay. So there is no dating life either :|. People are racist on all dating apps. “You smell like curry, you dont wash yourself, go back to your country” what not. At this point, i step out of the house and pray that I dont face any racism. I have no choice but to wear a mask and go out, because people just look at me and judge me. It just hurts man it just hurts. I had dreams of exploring the world while the world still exists but I feel like all my dreams are shattered and im stuck.",14,1737434578.0,offmychest,5,1.0,False
1i6arq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cymbalta/comments/1i6arq8/caffeine_intake_and_body_spasms/,Caffeine intake and body spasms ,"Hi all, so I used to take Sertraline and was then taken off it back in August 2024 and have been on Duloxetine since. Sertraline was no longer working for me at all, I suffered from blepharospasm in my right eye and then also noticed muscle twitching on the right side of my body. Since getting off Sertraline, this doesn’t occur constantly like it used to and noticed it only occurring when I have over one shot of coffee or am really fatigued or stressed. 

I was wondering if this has happened to any one else? When I don’t have any coffee it’s fine and can have soda and other caffeinated products okay, it’s just one or more shots of coffee and I noticed the spasms or seizures?

Last week I asked this girl if she'd like to go out for coffee over the weekend. She said she yes but she couldn't make the weekend plans because she goes back home over the weekends, while I live full time on campus. She then gave me her schedule of when's she's free during the week. I texted her Monday and stuck up a conversation. I asked if she was ready to go back to our freezing cold campus, but she said she's stuck at home or smth. Apparently her house got 3 feet of snow. On campus there's only 6 inches. We do go to college in upstate New York, where the weather is crazy like that due to lakes and stuff diverting the winds. She's also probably exaggerating when she says she's stuck and can't go anywhere, but idk.

Ultimately I'm taking that as a ""I don't want to go out"" hint, and I'm just gonna give up with her. 
It sucks because I really wanted to meet her, but what can you do. I also know for a fact if I never texted again I'd never hear from her first, so that should be reason enough to give up. It sucks but I guess it just wasn't ment to be. ",1,1737434441.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False
1i6apv1,https://i.redd.it/q7uedwue0aee1.jpeg,[Mentalist Rewatch] 6x05 The Red Tattoo,"This anniversary rewatch will run daily until February 18, the 10-year anniversary of the Mentalist's series finale.


**SPOILER WARNING: Since this is a rewatch, it's assumed that anyone in these discussions has already seen the entire show, so all spoilers are allowed.**


Day 120 brings us to ""The Red Tattoo,"" which sends us on another case with a Red John suspect, this time with Ray Haffner, who now works for the private sector, and one of his big clients includes Visualize, of which he is also a member. The episode begins by showing us a distraught man at a San Francisco hotel. He gets into an elevator with a man and his young son, who he shoves to get out. The man calls security, and when they arrive, they hear noises inside. The security man breaks in and finds the man, who says ""He stabbed me"" and then collapses. When the CBI team arrives, they find exercise equipment scattered around the room, including bands and sliders. They get a call about a homicide nearby, and Lisbon sends Rigsby to check it out to see if it's related. Haffner shows up with Jason Cooper, who says the murder is a prominent Visualize member, Chad Parkman. Jane walks out as Cooper hands Lisbon a letter from the lieutenant governor allowing them access to the investigation. In the elevator, Haffner tells Jane that they study him at Visualize now. Haffner tells Jane there's a comeuppance heading his way, and Jane tells him he's a worse psychic than he was a cop.

Title relevance: The PI the team meets, Kira, is killed by Red John or a disciple and tells Jane about a tattoo on his upper left arm, three dots, and she draws it in her own blood.

Notable guest stars: Ray Abruzzo (from The Practice and The Sopranos), Joe Nieves (from How I Met Your Mother and Stuck in the Middle), Robert Picardo (from Star Trek: Voyager), Beth Riesgraf (from Criminal Minds and Leverage: Redemption), David Starzyk (from Veronica Mars), Jeff Griggs (from Days of Our Lives)

Location: San Francisco


Notable scenes: 
- Jane goes with Cho to Marin, CA, to the gym the victim, Parkman, worked at. He meets a gymnast's dad who says that he didn't need to worry about Parkman being inappropriate with his daughter. Cho meets a seemingly klutzy parent (who looks a lot like Summer).
- Rigsby tells Lisbon that the stabbing scene is possibly connected to their case and that the hotel is visible from the scene.
- Parkman's partner admits he was really mad about him recently joining Visualize. They learn the stabbing victim, Devin Frost, used to work at the gym.
- The team gets word that Kirkland is dead, killed while trying to escape. Rigsby will talk to an officer about the case. Cordero comes in to give him a copy of the case file. Rigsby doesn't buy the story.
- Rigsby tries to talk about his sex life with Cho, who resists. Rigsby says he's going to find someone for Cho to thank him for helping him with Grace.
- Lisbon and Grace go back to the hotel and find Haffner there looking around. After talking to him, they notice that he's afraid of spiders. Haffner warns Lisbon and Grace, saying that there are a lot of powerful people Jane has pissed off, and that they should stay away from him.
- The blonde lady, Kira Tinsley, shows up at the bullpen looking for Cho. They go for coffee.
- The team learns that Parkman got into a struggle, which caused him to hemorrhage, which is what caused him to bleed out and die. Jane figures it out while Lisbon is giving him details, saying he figured it out. He searches Cho's desk and finds a bug, asks Lisbon to get an exercise band and meet him at the hotel room, then goes to look for Cho and Kira. 
- Jane finds them, then outs her as a PI by showing her the bug she planted. She says that she was hired by Visualize. Cho is about to put a tail on her when Jane says he tricked her and put the bug back in her purse, so they can listen to her whenever they want.
- Jane reveals how Parkman died, using the exercise band. He says Parkman and Frost were gay and started an inappropriate relationship when they were coach/student. Frost was blackmailing Parkman, but he shot him. Frost stabbed Parkman, and in his hotel room, Parkman used the exercise band to fling his murder weapon off the balcony, which caused him to injure himself so badly that he bled to death. (Note: I think there was an error in editing this episode, because the band shown in the flashback doesn't seem to be mentioned, but there is a different type of band seen on the floor at the scene.)
- When Cooper leaves, Jane tells him it was stupid to hire Kira to bug the CBI, but he denies it. Jane figures out that Red John bugged them, not Visualize, and he is worried that she's about to become his next victim. Grace, Rigsby, and Cho turn on the bug and listen as Jane and Lisbon race to her home. They listen as Kira is attacked.
- Sac PD arrives first, finding Kira alive but in bad shape. Jane and Lisbon arrive, and Jane frantically tries to get Kira to tell him who attacked her. All she says is ""Tattoo on his left arm,"" then draws three red dots on her left shoulder. Jane swipes it away so no one will see it later. Outside, Jane tells her what Kira said, and this will be his leverage on Red John.

1i6apff,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1i6apff/my_professors_useless_binary_tree_lecture_just/,My professor's 'useless' binary tree lecture just saved my internship,"The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead as I stared at my monitor, the clock mocking me with every passing minute. 2:47 AM. The office was a ghost town, empty energy drink cans scattered across my desk like fallen soldiers in my battle against this godforsaken codebase.

Three weeks into my dream internship at Microsoft, and I was drowning. The task seemed simple when my mentor described it - figure out why the customer data processing was taking longer than a Windows Vista update. But after days of diving through layers of legacy Java code, I felt like an archaeologist trying to decipher ancient hieroglyphics written by sleep-deprived developers.

The senior devs had started giving me those looks - you know the ones. The 'maybe we should've hired the kid who actually finished their Leetcode grind' looks. Even the cleaning staff had started leaving sympathetic coffee cups on my desk.

That's when it happened. In my caffeine-induced delirium, I started scrolling through my old class notes, hoping for divine intervention or at least a merciful power outage. Professor Johnson's voice echoed in my head, his words from that dreary Monday morning lecture suddenly crystallizing with terrible clarity: 'Unbalanced tree traversal is the silent killer of performance, kids.'

I sat up so fast my chair nearly achieved orbit. There it was, hidden in the depths of the legacy code like a digital war crime - nested traversals that would make any self-respecting computer scientist weep. The data structure was about as balanced as my sleep schedule.

My fingers flew across the keyboard, fueled by three years of theoretical computer science and enough caffeine to kill a small horse. Lines of code poured out as I implemented a proper balanced tree solution, each keystroke a small redemption for all those lectures I'd dismissed as academic torture.

The sun was peeking through the windows when I finally ran the tests. Ten seconds. The processing time had dropped from 45 minutes to ten seconds. I stared at the performance graphs, wondering if I'd finally hallucinated from exhaustion.

During standup that morning, my mentor's coffee achieved an impressive trajectory across his desk when he saw the numbers. The team lead actually stopped checking his phone. And there I sat, trying to maintain a professional demeanor while my inner CS student was doing victory laps around the binary tree of joy.

I've since drafted and deleted about fifteen emails to Professor Johnson. How do you tell someone 'Sorry I called binary trees a tool of Satan, you were right all along' without sounding like a complete tool?

For now, I'm riding this high and pretending I'm some kind of optimization genius instead of a sleep-deprived intern who got lucky because he was too tired to close his old class notes. The cleaning staff has upgraded me to premium coffee.

So here's to you, Professor Johnson, you magnificent algorithms wizard. I take back every eye roll, every under-breath muttering, every doodled binary tree with angry faces. Your lectures didn't just teach me data structures - they saved my dignity and possibly my entire career in tech.

Though I still maintain that red-black trees are unnecessarily dramatic. I mean, pick a color scheme and stick with it.",194,1737434330.0,csMajors,8,0.93,False

1i6aku7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discussion/comments/1i6aku7/im_impressed_that_displaced_communities_make_new/,I’m impressed that displaced communities make new and beautiful lives abroad…,"Picture this: you’re walking down a quiet street in a small town far from any coastline, and suddenly the scent of sizzling spices, the sound of a familiar song, or a brightly colored flag fluttering in the breeze transports you halfway across the world. It’s a little reminder that no matter how far people travel, home isn’t just a place—it’s something they carry with them.

For those whose lives have been upended by war, natural disasters, or economic hardship, finding home again can be an adventure filled with resilience, laughter, and, let’s be honest, a lot of good food. Take, for instance, the families who rebuilt their lives after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. They settled in communities thousands of miles from their coastal villages, bringing with them an unshakable spirit—and recipes that can make anyone feel like they belong.

In a small town in Sweden, a group of Sri Lankan families, displaced after the tsunami, have turned their sorrow into spice. They opened “Ceylon Delights,” a restaurant where the walls are adorned with the bright lion of the Sri Lankan flag, and the air is filled with the smell of coconut and curry leaves. Locals come in for their morning roti and end up staying for the warm conversations and stories. “We lost our home,” says Priya, one of the owners, “but here, we’ve found family in unexpected places.”

And then there’s the case of New Orleans natives who fled after Hurricane Katrina. Scattered across cities like Houston and Atlanta, they brought their music, their gumbo, and their famously warm hospitality. Walk into any one of their restaurants, and you’ll find neighbors tapping their feet to live jazz, while long-time residents swap hurricane stories with newcomers over a bowl of crawfish étouffée. “Houston welcomed us,” says Charles, a former Ninth Ward resident, “but we brought the party.”

Communities like these thrive not just because of their shared experiences, but because they’ve found ways to blend the old with the new. In Germany, Syrian refugees who left their homes due to war have started thriving businesses—from bustling kebab shops to cozy bakeries serving baklava and coffee strong enough to remind them of Damascus. And they’ve found friends in their new neighbors, too. “At first, I worried people wouldn’t understand us,” says Omar, who runs a popular café in Berlin. “But now, my German neighbors know how to say ‘shukran’ (thank you), and I can ask for bratwurst in perfect German.”

Similarly, Palestinian communities have flourished across the world in countries like Germany, Sweden, Canada, Australia, Chile, the United States, and other parts of Europe. Whether they are setting up thriving businesses in Berlin’s bustling Neukölln district, creating community hubs in Canadian cities like Toronto and Montreal, or opening family-run restaurants serving fragrant maqluba and knafeh in Sydney, Palestinians have brought their enduring spirit and rich culture to every corner of the globe. In Santiago, Chile—home to one of the largest Palestinian communities outside the Middle East—families gather in social clubs where they celebrate weddings, play soccer, and keep traditions alive through dance and storytelling. “We may be thousands of miles away,” says Yasmeen, a second-generation Chilean-Palestinian, “but every bite of my grandmother’s hummus reminds me where we come from.”

Faith, culture, and a bit of good humor often help people settle in and make a new country feel like home. In Canada, a group of Afghan families displaced over the past two decades gather every Friday for prayers and, of course, a massive pot of mantu dumplings. Their mosque has become a hub of laughter, shared wisdom, and the occasional friendly debate about whether Canadian hockey will ever truly replace cricket in their hearts (spoiler: it won’t).

And let’s not forget the surprising friendships that blossom when cultures meet. In a small town in Italy, a group of Bangladeshi families have not only opened successful textile shops but have also introduced their new neighbors to the wonders of samosas and chai. “They taught us to love spicy food,” jokes Marco, a local. “And we taught them how to make a proper espresso.”

Resettling after a disaster is never easy, but as these communities show, it’s not just about surviving—it’s about thriving. Whether it’s through food, music, faith, or a shared love for soccer (because let’s be honest, soccer transcends borders), these resilient individuals create little pockets of home wherever they go.

So the next time you stumble upon a family-run Ethiopian café in a quiet Midwest town, or hear the joyful strains of Caribbean music in an unexpected place, take a moment to step inside. Order something unfamiliar, ask a few questions, and you might just find yourself with new friends—and maybe even a new favorite dish.

Because home, after all, is where the heart—and the best recipes—are.

Here's a link explaining what happened -- [https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1funm7m/my\_f29\_exboyfriend\_m29\_and\_i\_are\_back\_in\_contact/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1funm7m/my_f29_exboyfriend_m29_and_i_are_back_in_contact/)

I've been talking to 'David' (m32) about the whole relationship, our first go, our time apart -- and I felt like I'd gain something from trying to break this all down in writing. Since it's very self indulgent I figured I'd just write it here.

  
How We Met 

  
I met David when I was working as a waitress and he was washing dishes at the diner in question. Now, I don't remember our first meeting very well. I know I was freshly 20, and he was 22 at that time. I remember, despite being pretty tall for a girl -- I'm around 5 foot 10 inches -- I had to look WAY up at him when we talked. 

David was a very quiet person, and we didn't talk much at first. I remember one time I was waiting outside for a bus after work and he walked out and offered to drive me home in his truck. I said no. So he said okay and left, but then stopped and said something along the lines of *How about I call you a cab, I'll cover it. Just don't think you should be out here alone.* 

The reason I remember it is that was the first time I looked at his face. I'd been on my own for two years, I avoided people because I didn't want them in my life. I didn't want to end up taking care of anyone, I'd had fourteen years of being the stand in parent for kid after kid. I didn't want to get involved with anyone.

He was so goddamn *pretty*. His eyes, his face... I remember panicking. He just had this way of looking at me, really making me feel like he was listening, waiting, and my mouth was so dry and my hands wanted to shake. 

I'd never dated anyone. High school was an ordeal I barely made it through, my community college courses were on a *what I can afford* schedule and I didn't have time left over after work and school. I'd never felt butterflies in the guy, never stood there with my mouth open just unable to put words to a moment. Was a virgin at 20 because I had decided never to let anyone do to me what my mom had done over and over again -- no chain of babies, no disaster relationships. I would have sooner jumped in front of a train than let myself be her.

But he was so pretty. His eyes were a faint almost green, like hazel but softer, and his face was so open. I knew he meant what he was saying, knew it immediately. I didn't want to know it -- I'd been ignoring him for months at this point. But I did know it. 

I let him drive me to my apartment. Didn't invite him up, but I did say thank you, and I think I even smiled. The next time I saw him at work (two days after) we ended up talking. Not *about* anything, just... talking. It was nice. There wasn't any pressure. 

Then I asked him to go to a movie. I think it was *Finding Dory* at the local cheapass matinee theatre, down the road from the diner. Middle of the day, because that was all I could afford. We sat there, laughed a few times, and then I kissed him. I told myself I didn't want to kiss him over and over again and then he leaned back and smiled at me and said something like *this is nice* and I snapped. 

I was all over him. We were making out like we were at something a lot more adult than a pixar movie about a fish with bad memory. This was literally my first consensual kiss -- I'd had a boy force one on me when I was 15. This one annihilated my memory of what that one felt like. 

We didn't rush off to have sex or anything. We didn't even really hammer out we were dating or not until Christmas. We did spend a lot of time making out for a few months, and then slowly moved along. 

What no one ever told me was how it could just suddenly hit you, that you wanted it. That you wanted this person, that you actually hurt a little from wanting them. I realized I loved him during that awkward talk, with him asking me if we were dating or not and I nodded, my face sore from the smile I could not make myself stop. I don't remember what I said, but I know it was good enough to get me one of those smiles of his. 

So for a year and a half we were together, and I was... I didn't drink often, didn't do weed. All of my *this is what being high feels like* came from that year. We loved each other. We'd said it. I felt it, like my guts were those metal shavings in those shitty old toys the creature who called himself my grandfather used to play with me. David would walk into view and I felt the magnet pulling on my insides, pulling me closer to him. And I wanted to be pulled. 

I had nothing to compare the sex to, but I still loved it because it was him, it was me, it was *us*. After we broke up I was with a couple of other guys. I know rationally the difference wasn't particularly huge, but I also know that none of them could make me want to be there like David did. 

  
[The Break Up](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1fss3qh/i_am_now_doubting_everything_about_myself_since_i/) and the Aftermath

Above link has all the details. 

Having talked to David since, I now know that after a brief period of shutting down, he thought two things:

* There was no way I cheated on him. Between how I described what happened and the stuff I couldn't explain, he was pretty sure I'd been SA'd.
* He thought his brother 'Sam' did it.

I also thought Sam had sex with me -- it was Sam's bed, after all -- but I didn't think it was rape. I just thought I was a cheating slut, which is why I broke up with and ghosted David. 

Which broke David. Hearing him describe the next three years makes me hate myself even though he won't have it -- he gets made when I start on that path. ""You were a victim of something horrible in a place you felt safe and it happened because I wasn't there."" That's where HE is full of shit, I suppose.

Over the next three to four years, David healed, if imperfectly. He had a couple of really bad relationships because he wanted to get over me and find someone who would let him love them. First asshole girl was just using him for money. Second one was using him for a place to stay. Then he met 'Cynthia' (f33) and she seemed to be the one who understood what he went through. 

David apologizes for this one a lot which I keep telling him is bullshit. I was the one who walked away and moved to another fucking city, what was he supposed to do? Wait forever? He was happy, for a while, and that was all I ever wanted for him. 

So, David didn't know I was back in town for the first year or so that I was. He didn't know I'd seen him and Cyn walking around together, nor that I'd compared myself to her and decided he was a lot better off with her. So he kept on in his relationship, convinced they were in love and he even proposed to her. She said yes, and they planned a date and everything. April 2024.

And then two things happened, neither of which I knew about. 

The first is that Sam, who'd gotten married and moved to Worcester, was in town looking for a place for him and his family. Their dad found out, told David (their dad is a complete bag of shit, he loves to set people up to fight because he'd like some kind of demon of drama, as well as abusive and an utter alcoholic) and David nearly lost his shit.

Then, while out on a walk trying to get his head on straight, he walked past my grandparent's place. He knew I'd moved there after we broke up, and my grandmother had kept him appraised on everything. When I moved away it was her that told him. So he walked by there, and he saw me coming out.

And he knew he didn't love his fiancee. He just *knew* it, he says, and felt like an utter piece of shit for it. *I was using her. I didn't know it, but when I saw your face... that little scar on your cheek from when you were a kid, the one I'd trace with my finger. I knew.* He didn't come up to me. Didn't want to intrude, had no idea what my life was like. Maybe I was married, maybe I was over him, didn't want to ruin anything for me.

He went home to break up with his fiancee and caught her with her stepbrother, naked and thrusting. And laughed, because he didn't have to be the bad guy. Sure, he'd used her to try and get over everything, but she'd been fucking her stepbro behind his back. Got her to admit it had been going on for two years. At the time she was throwing it in his face, stormed out of their shared apartment.

David then decided to go finally get Sam to admit what he'd done to me. The only problem was that Sam didn't do it, and he had his wife there to back that story up. She was even the one who'd suggested putting me in Sam's bed when I drank myself unconscious. The whole crowd of them left me there and Sam ended up at her apartment. They even had pictures of them in the apartment because Sam had asked her to marry him that night. David could have found this all out earlier if he hadn't tried to stick Sam's head down the garbage disposal.

So there David was. He knew he still wanted me back, and he knew what had actually happened to me, but what he didn't have was a way to talk to me. I didn't use the same phone number or email anymore. He didn't even know where I lived, and I keep myself good and unlisted on purpose after a bad roommate scenario involving shower cameras. In my life, that's a lighthearted story of zany roommate hijinks and not a horrible story of violation. 

But Sam's a cop. State Police, in fact -- that's why he moved back down from Woostah. I don't know how, but he got my number, called and texted me, and eventually explained what had happened to me and who he thought did it.  Then he asked me to call David, said he really wanted to talk to me again. That he missed me.

A few days later I managed to make myself text him.

  
The Aftermath

I didn't know how I was going to feel seeing David again. I didn't know how *he* would feel. I couldn't let myself believe there was anything left between us but maybe regret. 

Then I saw his face. It happened a few months ago now but it feels so distant, the time before he was back in my life. We had coffee. Well, I had coffee, he had some ridiculous thing with so much sugar in it I could smell it across the table. And his face... Jesus, but he got even better looking. His eyes are fully green now, at least most of the time, He has a more angular chin, perpetual stubblebeard, and his smile has this brilliance to it. It makes me quiver, like hitting a tuning fork. 

We ended up at his place. We didn't have sex that night, but he did talk about his feelings, about how he'd always missed me, about maybe we could at least be friends again. I just nodded a lot, honestly. Even knowing what had happened, I just...

I don't know how to explain how happy I was to find out that I hadn't cheated on him. Even though I know (especially after the therapy, I'm still going at least weekly) that it was traumatic and a violation, at least it wasn't a choice I made to do that to him. 

That night was the first day we spent the night together in 8 years. It was also the last time we didn't. I'm so sorry for the shit he went through, but I can't be sorry that he ended up back here with me. I'll never be sorry that we're here, that he still loves me. That I still love him. 

His ex has tried to come back since. Last time she used his dad to get to him, had his dad call and tell him he had an emergency only to find out that the emergency was that Cynthia was at his house looking for a second chance.  Now, David has been kinda sorta joke proposing since we got back together. But this time, he came back with a pallor over his face and a look of pure rage in his eyes.

His dad called me names, I guess. David kicked him in the balls. Got home, proposed to me. We got married the next weekend. 

I'll never regret that, either.

Oh, I fought so hard to pretend I didn't, but I did. I always did. I love you, babe. I loved you when we started, when we were apart, and every second since we got back. I wish I'd been stronger at the time. I wish I had been able to deal with what I thought I'd done. But I'll never wish that you and I didn't happen. 

You're what love really is. Thank you so much for you. ",1,1737433745.0,u_confused_Struggling,0,1.0,False

I cant really afford to get inhalers so I need to make sure I use them as little as possible. I will use them when I have an attack obviously, but I cant keep getting them every few weeks. Right now it is the hardest time of the year for me to breathe. My asthma has many triggers, including cold weather, altitude (thin/dry air), allergies (am allergic to like everything),  candles and other unnatural scents, dust, etc. Unfortunately, I live in a Denver suburb. Quality of air is not great, it is below freezing temperatures and will be for probably the whole month, and I live a few blocks from a place with horses and hay (idk if that is close enough to trigger but its worth mentioning). I am tired of the constant asthma attacks and I want to know if someone in similar conditions with similar triggers has techniques that helps them better manage their asthma. Here are some things I am already doing:

- On allergy medicine (equate 24 hr relief)

- Montelukast every night

- Humifidier next to my bed

- Air purifier in my room

- Coffee in the mornings, and a heavy shot of it at night. No, it doesnt make me unable to sleep. I drink it completely black.

- Cough syrup/honey, getting a dry cough sometimes triggers an attack.

- Change into clean clothes before sleep

Despite all of this, I still do get attacks. I would love to be able to rely on getting a full nights sleep, instead of randomly waking up at least once per night needing my inhaler. Ive talked to my immunologist many times and we developed the routine I have above to minimize attacks, but thats about all he can come up with. I dont expect to never have to use an inhaler, I just want to sleep well and not  go through inhalers so quickly.

It may also be worth mentioning that my lungs have bad scarring due to mismanaging asthma as a kid. I am 21 now and am working on improving it. Any help would be appreciated.",1,1737433537.0,Asthma,4,1.0,False

A part of my treatment included a really weird drug that the body doesn’t tolerate very well. The way they combat this is by giving you Benadryl before taking that drug… like a lot of Benadryl. So I walked into the treatment centre with my dad and sat in the recliner chairs they had, my dad sitting on a stool beside me. The nurse handed me my Benadryl along with some other drugs to prepare my body for the 2 hours of chemo. I took the Benadryl, put my headphones on and tried to sleep. I was playing a playlist of a bunch of Queen songs, and hoped that would take me on a journey. I had a weird dream, where I was sitting in the same recliner just watching everyone pass me by. I could see the nurses walking around and could hear them talking to other patients. The music I was listening to was now in the background as if playing on the hospital PA system. I saw my dad sitting beside me watching me, it was so surreal. At some point I saw him get up and grab a coffee and come back. It was like my dream was just what was happening around me and my brain was piecing together a reality that didn’t exist. It made me feel like the world as I knew it could simply just be in my mind. I woke up two hours later when my chemo infusion was done and looked at my dad. He looked at me funny, I said “what?“. He said, “you freaked me out, you really just sat there for two hours, you barely blinked”. I didn’t know what he meant, I was still piecing things together from the dream I just saw. I looked over and saw he was holding a coffee cup, like the one I saw him get. I realized this whole time that I wasn’t asleep and was not dreaming. That dream was literally just me sitting there blankly staring off into oblivion. I also was not wearing headphones and have no idea what music I was hearing.

The spiralling was real on Jan 1. It’s safe to say I indeed got my shit together. Am I caught up on my work though? Um.. no. Lol. But I made a massive dent in it. I was extremely behind. Plus, everything is on my laptop now. I hate that I’m saying this, but thank God for AI in the context of completing my work… 

I got some good momentum going in the holidays. I need to get back into the hyper focus of catch-up, but I lack balance that way. My focus in January has been to maintain balance. Bit by bit, one small step in the right direction in all  of the important facets of life. 

So things have been good in my habit setting, getting things done, my physical and mental health, my relationship, my friendships, my work, organization, my routine, discipline. My problems are still in existence but it helps a lot to know I’m working hard every day to make things better. That’s all we can lean back on sometimes, folks.

It’s Jan 20 though, and it’s supposed to be the first day of stopping my weed addiction. Yes, an addiction, I’ll call it exactly what it is and I will not pussyfoot around about it for once. I really got the itch at 1:45pm. I’m not being hard on myself when I say it’s pathetic! Why am I looking for old empty carts in my home? And secretly puffing them when my partner isn’t around. Lol.. I also took an edible. The joke’s on me, my tolerance is so out of control that it barely did shit to me. That’s really why it’s sitting there to begin with or I would’ve used it by now. 

Okay, tomorrows a new day. We stayed up so late last night, and I left the house for a medical appointment without my coffee this morning. It was all very chaotic, and I like my mornings to be peaceful. You know, to mentally prepare for my natural chaos. So let me try again tomorrow? I’ve got a plan to take a bag, throw all the carts out as I go to the gym in the morning. I have a few uneaten gummies, how can I just toss them out?! I don’t know, but I need to get this shit out of my house! Clearly I have no self control! 

Last little tidbit is that I did an ovulation test today. My luteinizing hormone is up, a week later than expected. My partner and I are having a weird day today, in fact, he’s honestly really pissing me off. maybe it’ll take this time, it definitely will be a memorable day.

1i6acka,https://i.redd.it/9zl5zkiow9ee1.gif,"Tuesday, January 21, 2025 | Word of The Day ""Ephemeral"" - The Elusive Nature of Time: How We Lose It Without Even Realizing • [Click to Expand] ","## Time – A Fleeting Resource That We Can't Hold Onto Forever  



**Time is hard to account for; it is easily spent, squandered, stolen, and lost.** How many times have we found ourselves at the end of the day wondering where all the time went? It’s one of those things that feels like there’s never enough of it, yet when we look back, it seems like we’ve done very little with it. Time, in many ways, feels like sand slipping through our fingers. It’s elusive, it’s precious, and most of us struggle to get a handle on it.

Let me start with a bit of a personal anecdote. When I was in college, I remember this constant tension between wanting to enjoy the present and knowing I had so much work to do. I’d spend hours on the phone with friends, watching endless episodes of some new show, and before I knew it, the semester was over, and I hadn’t finished a single project. What did I do with all that time? It was so easy to waste it without thinking much about it.

The truth is, time is probably the most paradoxical thing in our lives. On one hand, it feels like there’s never enough of it, especially when we’re busy, rushing, or overwhelmed. On the other hand, it’s so easy to lose track of it, spending it in ways that, looking back, feel like a waste. It's like time has this funny ability to slip away quietly, sometimes without us even noticing.

### The Illusion of Control

What makes time even trickier is that, unlike money or material resources, we can't control it. We can save up money, we can make investments to secure more wealth in the future, but we can't store up time. Once a moment has passed, it’s gone forever. That’s the real kicker, isn’t it? There’s no time vault where we can deposit spare hours for later use. Each minute is precious and fleeting.

One way I’ve come to understand this is by comparing time to something tangible. Imagine if every time you bought a coffee, you could feel your bank account drain in real time. It’s easy to see how quickly your money can go when you track every purchase. Time works in a similar way, but because it’s intangible, it’s far harder to notice when we’re losing it. You can spend hours scrolling through social media, and it might feel like only a few minutes, but the hours add up. When we waste time, it’s like we’ve spent it without any real accountability.

It also seems like time can be easily stolen from us, often without our consent. How many of us have sat through a meeting or listened to someone talk endlessly about something we couldn’t care less about, only to realize we’ve just lost 30 minutes that we’ll never get back? It’s as if time just slipped from our grasp without a moment of warning. This experience is a familiar one—whether it's a work obligation, a commitment we didn’t want to make, or even just watching TV in a half-daze, we've all experienced these instances of time being stolen from us.

### Squandering Time: The Trap of Busyness

Another thing I’ve realized is how easy it is to squander time in the name of “busyness.” There’s this strange social pressure, especially in today’s world, to always be on the move. We fill our calendars with meetings, activities, events, and tasks that may seem important at the time but in the grand scheme of things, aren’t necessarily meaningful. We’ve all fallen into this trap at some point or another. We tell ourselves we’re “busy,” but are we actually being productive? 

Take, for instance, the feeling of being “busy” but still feeling unsatisfied at the end of the day. I’ve had days when I’ve checked off dozens of things from my to-do list, but at the end of the day, I still felt like something was missing. It’s like I’ve spent time doing things that aren’t necessarily important or fulfilling. Busyness becomes an illusion of productivity, and we trick ourselves into thinking we’ve done something of value. But in the end, it’s just time spent on the surface, doing tasks that don’t lead to any deeper sense of accomplishment or meaning.

This brings me to an important realization: just because we’re busy doesn’t mean we’re using our time wisely. In fact, sometimes the busier we are, the more likely we are to waste time on things that don’t truly matter. The trap is believing that time spent in constant motion or action is inherently valuable. But time spent in a frantic rush often leads to exhaustion without the satisfaction of feeling truly productive. We might think we’re accomplishing a lot, but in reality, we could be filling our days with distractions that prevent us from focusing on what really matters.

### The Importance of Intentionality

Over time, I’ve learned that one of the most valuable things we can do is to be intentional about how we use our time. When we live intentionally, we can make sure that our time aligns with our priorities, values, and goals. Being intentional about time means making conscious choices about how we want to spend it, and not just letting it slip away in moments of distraction or mindlessness.

For example, I’ve become more aware of how I spend my weekends. Instead of allowing time to simply pass by, I now try to structure my weekends in a way that feels meaningful. Whether it’s catching up on rest, spending quality time with family, or focusing on a personal project, being intentional with how I spend my time has made me feel more connected to my life. It’s about not letting the days blend together in a blur of wasted hours but instead creating a rhythm that feels productive and fulfilling.

Being intentional doesn’t mean we have to be perfect or regimented with every minute of our day. It just means that we’re more conscious of how we spend our time, ensuring that we’re doing things that bring us closer to the life we want to live. It’s about striking a balance between work and relaxation, activity and rest, doing and being. By making intentional choices, we can make the most out of our finite time and avoid letting it slip away unnoticed.

### Accepting Time’s Limits

It’s also important to come to terms with the fact that time is finite. We can’t make more of it, and we can’t stop it from passing. The sooner we accept this truth, the more likely we are to value our time and use it wisely. There’s an inevitability to time that we cannot escape, and acknowledging this fact helps us focus on the things that really matter.

One way this has become clear to me is through the concept of regret. I think about how many times I’ve wished for more hours in the day or more days in the year. But in reality, all we have is this moment—the present. It’s easy to look back and wish we had done things differently, but if we spend too much time in the past or the future, we miss out on the present. Time is constantly moving forward, and all we can do is try to live fully in the moments we have left.

### Conclusion

At the end of the day, time is something that we can neither control nor recover once it's gone. It is easily spent, squandered, stolen, and lost—but it’s also something we can choose to cherish and make the most of. By being mindful of how we use it, setting intentions, and accepting its limits, we can start to live in a way that values time as the precious resource it truly is. Time may be hard to account for, but if we pay attention, we might just find that the moments we do spend are the ones that matter most.

1i6acgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1i6acgt/article_talks_about_populations_displaced_by/,Article talks about populations displaced by catastrophe thriving abroad…,"Picture this: you’re walking down a quiet street in a small town far from any coastline, and suddenly the scent of sizzling spices, the sound of a familiar song, or a brightly colored flag fluttering in the breeze transports you halfway across the world. It’s a little reminder that no matter how far people travel, home isn’t just a place—it’s something they carry with them.

For those whose lives have been upended by war, natural disasters, or economic hardship, finding home again can be an adventure filled with resilience, laughter, and, let’s be honest, a lot of good food. Take, for instance, the families who rebuilt their lives after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. They settled in communities thousands of miles from their coastal villages, bringing with them an unshakable spirit—and recipes that can make anyone feel like they belong.

In a small town in Sweden, a group of Sri Lankan families, displaced after the tsunami, have turned their sorrow into spice. They opened “Ceylon Delights,” a restaurant where the walls are adorned with the bright lion of the Sri Lankan flag, and the air is filled with the smell of coconut and curry leaves. Locals come in for their morning roti and end up staying for the warm conversations and stories. “We lost our home,” says Priya, one of the owners, “but here, we’ve found family in unexpected places.”

And then there’s the case of New Orleans natives who fled after Hurricane Katrina. Scattered across cities like Houston and Atlanta, they brought their music, their gumbo, and their famously warm hospitality. Walk into any one of their restaurants, and you’ll find neighbors tapping their feet to live jazz, while long-time residents swap hurricane stories with newcomers over a bowl of crawfish étouffée. “Houston welcomed us,” says Charles, a former Ninth Ward resident, “but we brought the party.”

Communities like these thrive not just because of their shared experiences, but because they’ve found ways to blend the old with the new. In Germany, Syrian refugees who left their homes due to war have started thriving businesses—from bustling kebab shops to cozy bakeries serving baklava and coffee strong enough to remind them of Damascus. And they’ve found friends in their new neighbors, too. “At first, I worried people wouldn’t understand us,” says Omar, who runs a popular café in Berlin. “But now, my German neighbors know how to say ‘shukran’ (thank you), and I can ask for bratwurst in perfect German.”

Similarly, Palestinian communities have flourished across the world in countries like Germany, Sweden, Canada, Australia, Chile, the United States, and other parts of Europe. Whether they are setting up thriving businesses in Berlin’s bustling Neukölln district, creating community hubs in Canadian cities like Toronto and Montreal, or opening family-run restaurants serving fragrant maqluba and knafeh in Sydney, Palestinians have brought their enduring spirit and rich culture to every corner of the globe. In Santiago, Chile—home to one of the largest Palestinian communities outside the Middle East—families gather in social clubs where they celebrate weddings, play soccer, and keep traditions alive through dance and storytelling. “We may be thousands of miles away,” says Yasmeen, a second-generation Chilean-Palestinian, “but every bite of my grandmother’s hummus reminds me where we come from.”

Faith, culture, and a bit of good humor often help people settle in and make a new country feel like home. In Canada, a group of Afghan families displaced over the past two decades gather every Friday for prayers and, of course, a massive pot of mantu dumplings. Their mosque has become a hub of laughter, shared wisdom, and the occasional friendly debate about whether Canadian hockey will ever truly replace cricket in their hearts (spoiler: it won’t).

And let’s not forget the surprising friendships that blossom when cultures meet. In a small town in Italy, a group of Bangladeshi families have not only opened successful textile shops but have also introduced their new neighbors to the wonders of samosas and chai. “They taught us to love spicy food,” jokes Marco, a local. “And we taught them how to make a proper espresso.”

Resettling after a disaster is never easy, but as these communities show, it’s not just about surviving—it’s about thriving. Whether it’s through food, music, faith, or a shared love for soccer (because let’s be honest, soccer transcends borders), these resilient individuals create little pockets of home wherever they go.

So the next time you stumble upon a family-run Ethiopian café in a quiet Midwest town, or hear the joyful strains of Caribbean music in an unexpected place, take a moment to step inside. Order something unfamiliar, ask a few questions, and you might just find yourself with new friends—and maybe even a new favorite dish.

Because home, after all, is where the heart—and the best recipes—are.

I'm going back to university (college for all you Americans) and am looking for recommendations. I'm no backpack aficionado, and don't really know what's out there.  I do have a few things I would like it to have/cater towards to make my life easier. 

Storage space for for the following: 

* 13inch laptop and 11in iPad, charger and cables
* 1L water bottle (preferably space for 2 bottles as I also like to prep my coffee and take with me)
* Notebook and pen compartment 
* Bits and bobs compartment (AirPods, sunglasses etc)
* Somewhat optional: space for meal prepped food (trying to get my life in order and spend less on overpriced uni meals).

  
Design wise, I'd really like it to cater to following: 

* Breathable back (I live in Australia and it gets HOT here in summer). 
* Comfortable straps and overall design 
* Somewhat water-resistant (winters here can be very rainy. I will have an umbrella, but better safe than sorry). 
* Preferably a fold over top like the Bellroy Melbourne for ease of access (I was looking at getting this, but saw some people say that the material quality is pretty bad).
* Easy to access compartments (hate digging through backpacks to find stuff)
* Overall pleasing design (what can I say, I'm kinda vain lol) 

  
Budget wise, I'm not sure yet. Happy to get budget, middle, and higher tier suggests and then I can weigh up what's worth it for me. ",2,1737433022.0,backpacks,0,1.0,False

*We snoop around an old tower!*

*We've been in the west, trying to head to the 'Wizard of Wine Winery', however on the way there, we find Von Richten's tower. Naturally we let ourselves in, peruse around and find out how poorly the place is kept. But it's not all spades. We manage to find and control an animated suit of armor, which we've named Khazan.*   
*Young Frawd is no longer the only one in the group that has muscles now.*  
  
*After casing the joint, we head back down and find Ireena talking to 'Esmerelda', a woman, who is a servant of Von Richten. She worries about him after finding out his plans to kill Strahd and comes in search for him to either help or dissuade him. We tell her to look for him in Valakey, maybe he's still around. But as for ourselves, we get back on the dirt path towards the Winery.*   


*When we approach the winery, were-ravens transform in front of us and ask us for help. Seems they know about our good deeds back in Valakey and think we're here to help em. So we do!*   
*But had we only known how bad things were gunna be, I believe we would have ran away...*  
*The ware-ravens tell us that twig blights have infested the fields and trying to harvest, let alone work around the fields is a death sentence. Heading towards the very same fields, our party is instantly attacked by dozens of Twig Blights and a few Scarecrows! We take care of most of the twig blights, but more keep pouring out like roaches in a New York sink. The scarecrows puts up a bigger fight and we find ourselves rushing towards a building for cover. Will these walls be our savior or our tomb?*

*MORE Scarecrows approach, while Frawd who is still just outside, gets attacked by Twig Blights, who don't land a blow.*  
 

^(Dusty goes offline for a moment in real life, so Steven roleplays Frawd, having him run inside to the building.)

  
*Lots of scratching can be heard outside. We command Khazan to get the table and barricade the door.*

  
Outside, Mr Caw is left. This gives the party line of sight of the remaining monsters outside this building. Using range, Mr Caw begins taking pot shots at the baddies with Eldritch blast

*Khazan shoves the table in the way of the door with success.* 

*Mr Caw disengages and flies away.*  
*Ireena comes back from the basement, relaying she didn't find an exit down there.* 

We give a moment to look around the room now that it's safe

>***A dirty window in the south wall allows dim light to enter this room. Wine bottles are manufactured here, as evidenced by the tools lying about, the wooden rack full of freshly blown glass bottles along the south wall, the hearth built into the southwest corner, and the barrel of sand standing next to it. A staircase descends underground, and between it and the rack of bottles stands a barred door. -*** *DM Mark*



*Nigellius runs into an room*

>***The rich smell of fermenting wine fills this large, two-story chamber, which is dominated by four enormous wooden casks, each one eight feet wide and twelve feet tall. A wooden staircase in the center of the room climbs to a ten-foot-high wooden balcony that clings to the south wall, which has four windows set into it at balcony level. Stacked against the wall underneath the balcony are old, empty barrels with ""The Wizard of Wines"" burned into their sides. The balcony climbs another five feet as it continues along the west and east walls, ending at doors leading to the winery's upper level. Underneath these side balconies are several doors, some of which hang open. Beneath the sloping roof stretch thick rafters, upon which scores of ravens have quietly gathered. They watch you with great interest. -*** *DM Mark*



*Nigellius moves eastward, climbing over barrels. When he sees something further back into this room..*

>***The balcony creaks, drawing your eye to a wild-looking figure hunched over the westernmost cask, pouring a flask of thick syrup into it. She wears a gown made of animal skins and a headdress with goat horns, and her hair is long and unkempt. Suddenly, you see something skittering across the floor. It looks like a tiny creature made of twigs. It moves from its hiding place under the stairs and disappears behind the easternmost cask.***





*Cuspertin flanks Nigellius and tells Khazan to follow him. Frawd hops on Khazan's back for a free ride.*

**Frawd**, roll Dex check  
**6**  
*Scampers up Khazan's back and slides back down to the floor*

  
*A few more large hits come off the splintering door in the other room, which is now fully resting on the blocking table.*

Mr Caw begins searching for available windows to get into

**Mr Caw**, roll investigation  
**14**  
*He finds a crack window and comes inside to a group of ravens.*

**Mr. Caw,** roll animal handing on the Ravens for the vibes  
**19**  
*They seem chill*



*Frawd is the last person in the main hall with the collapsing door behind him. He can hear strange sounds coming from down the stairs. He points his SunSword in that direction and walks towards the stairs...*

  
*---- to be continued ----*



***ARE WE GOING TO SPLIT THE PARTY?!***

***IS THIS THE WINDMILL 2.0 ALL OVER AGAIN!?***

**Quotes**

***""well that's only if you pee...you have to pee for them to do that. But the trick is that we force feed you coffee the whole time, so that way your pee and pooing and they always swim up your butthole if you poop"" -*** *Dusty, no context*
