She was in there mopping and we thought maybe they were opening soon but apparently still working with their builders and Health Department. Understandable.

It’s Vietnamese owned and will be serving Vietnamese coffee and Seattle-based roast and those Dutch Bros Italian sodas. They’re looking into Vietnamese sandwiches and pastries in the future!

*By Your Favorite Sports Oracle with a Side of Whimsy*

### Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams in Decimal Dress

Let’s start with the numbers, because even in soccer, math doesn’t lie (unless you’re a ref in a tight call). The odds for this A-League clash paint Melbourne Victory as a slight favorite, with decimal prices hovering around **2.30** (implied probability: \~43.5%) compared to Adelaide United’s **2.75** (\~36.4%). The draw sits at **3.80** (\~26.3%), which is about the same chance as your local barista remembering your coffee order without you spelling your name twice.

The spreads lean heavily on Adelaide (-0.25) and the under (3.25 goals) being the safer bet, suggesting bookmakers expect a low-scoring, tense affair. For context, Melbourne hasn’t scored in four straight games—longer than a Netflix series that’s already been canceled. Adelaide’s odds reflect their status as the “team that isn’t Melbourne,” which, in this context, is a compliment.

### Digest the News: Fresh Legs vs. Stale Bread

**Melbourne Victory**: Arthur Diles, the coach, is currently surviving on a diet of “hope” and “we’ll fix this next week” (ingredients not recommended by nutritionists). His team is winless in five matches and has the attacking flair of a deflated balloon. But there’s light at the tunnel: Socceroos star Nishan Velupillay returns from the bench to start, and Nikos Vergos is back after a Jing Reec-induced hiatus. Diles calls this match “a perfect game to get back on that horse,” which is soccer-coach code for “I hope the horse doesn’t kick me this time.”

**Adelaide United**: Coach Airton Andrioli is playing the long game, rewarding hard work over re

1plg7i7,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1plg7i7/deeper_into_not_giving_a_fk/,Deeper into not giving a f***k,"So a couple months ago I posted here about starting to not give a fuck about things, and stopping living life on hard mode when I could make it easier. 

Happy to report that philosophy has been implemented to a new host of things this festive season, for the better! 

MIL buying up a thousand things, making sure our presents will be meaningless and kiddo will get bored and overwhelmed as they usually do after the 10th present? I choose to ignore it. She’s trying to show love, I’ll let her, and I can choose not to sweat it. Kiddo will be overwhelmed. It will be fine. I did an “anticipating declutter” of old toys so I’m less stressed about bringing them back in later.

Advocated for secret Santa’s for my side of the family, and we’ll do the exchange when we see each other next - in a couple months. It’s fine. There doesn’t need to be a present the day off, saves us all a headache in terms of logistics. 

I’ve also had a revelation regarding exercise. I realised that 1) I know what exercises I like to do, and I don’t need a gym to do them and 2) what is actually preventing me from exercising is that I don’t have the time and I got caught up in the Instagram Coach bullshit about having the same 24 hours in a day and being able to set aside 30 mins to an hour, etc. Nope, I’ve woken up at 5 and got back home at 17h30, and I want to spend time with my kid and take a shower and that’s it! Not stuff myself into Lycra to go to a cramped gym feeling judged by 20-something’s who have been there all day. 

So now I do “exercise as I live”, I don’t know if there is a term for that. Basically, I do exercise as life happens. Coffee pouring? I clench my abs for 10-20 seconds intervals. Kid watching TV? I bust a bunch of sumo squats. Brushing my teeth? I do calve raises at the same time. It’s only been a couple weeks, and I feel such a difference. Turns out I don’t need an expensive gym membership or a lot of time, and taking that pressure off myself actually works better than stressing myself out. 

I also refused a whole bunch of hosting. Suggested we meet somewhere public (restaurant, or a rented room) instead, so there is either no cleaning up or everyone participates. Such a relief to not have to scrub the house on a Saturday morning. Instead, we’re in our pjs and I’m sipping coffee, and we’ll just have to get dressed and head out in a couple hours. 

So yeah, little update but I’m so proud of myself, and compared to last year when I was tying myself into knots about the festive season with an impossible schedule for myself, and beating myself down about going on holidays and not having access to a gym I didn’t want to go to anyway… this feels so good!

Cheers to all the happy moms not giving a fuck this season! ",2,1765613090.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False

On tables on the floor crushed and rolling around. My college roommate threw it celebrating something. Some promotion or deal or whatever. I lost track of his wins honestly. I came because he insisted but standing there I felt super uncomfortable. He has money now. Nice suits loud parties constant stress. I teach high school English for basically nothing. But my students write me thank you notes. They tell me I changed how they see the world. He has money and anxiety. I have students and purpose. At the party surrounded by strangers I nursed one beer and wondered what success actually means. He found me eventually already drunk. Threw his arm around me. Said I was so lucky. That I actually matter to people while he just moves money around. The honesty surprised me. I looked at his expensive watch designer clothes apartment that costs more than I make in six months. And I saw envy going the wrong direction. He envied me. We talked for an hour really talked maybe for the first time since graduation. He said the money felt empty without meaning. I admitted I resent the financial struggle sometimes. We left together ditched the party and the heineken cans for a quiet diner. Terrible coffee and pancakes at three AM. We reconnected over that meal. Later I sent him book recommendations. Found some titles at good prices while browsing sites like Alibaba. Money is not the problem or the answer we both figured out. Connection is what matters. We are going to work at staying connected even though our lives look completely different. The cans and the party did not matter.

1plg3b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/overpopulation/comments/1plg3b7/food_imbalance_in_the_world/,Food imbalance in the world,"These days, many people tend to think that countries with huge populations have enough support to sustain themselves. This is completely wrong.

The world population, which stood at 750 million in the early 18th century, more than doubled to approximately 1.6 billion by the end of the 19th century. The 20th century was a period of rapid growth in agricultural productivity. The development of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and the widespread use of pesticides led to a quantitative shift in agriculture.



Consequently, the world population soared from 2.5 billion in 1950 to 4 billion in 1975, and food production kept pace. By 2023, the world population will exceed 8 billion, and the foundation for feeding all of this population was a combination of favorable climate conditions, fertile soil, and long-lasting agricultural innovations.



However, all of this is now breaking down. Overpopulation is beginning to lead to climate change, soil degradation, and agricultural devastation.



Yes, increased agricultural productivity has undoubtedly contributed significantly to global population growth. But does that mean all countries should stop importing food altogether? Absolutely not.



In the past, population was completely dependent on regional production. While high-value-added luxury goods like pepper, coffee, sugar, and cocoa have long been at the heart of international trade, the movement of calories—the very things that feed people—was virtually impossible.



However, this is no longer the case. With the introduction of bulk carriers capable of transporting large quantities of food, food, previously tied to local regions, began to move across borders and oceans. While population growth has stagnated in the breadbaskets of Europe, Ukraine, and Russia, food production in these regions has steadily increased. The United States also enjoys a significant surplus.



However, other regions have not. Food production in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa is currently stagnant. No country classified as developed East Asian has seen its staple food, rice production, decline for four consecutive years. Ultimately, this surplus is flowing into Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.



The emergence of the global food supply chain was a significant turning point. Access to food, the most fundamental constraint that had long held back population growth, has been relaxed, creating conditions for population growth independent of local productivity.



As a result, the discrepancy between soil productivity and population density has widened. While high population densities once existed in areas with densely packed fertile soils, food produced in these fertile soils is now transported to cities on completely different continents, increasing the physical distance between food and population.



We must now view the critical issues facing agriculture, population, and food not simply from a local perspective, but as part of a global system.



The modern global food system is where harvests on the other side of the globe determine what ends up on our plates.



In the 1950s, Egypt's population was only 30 million. By the 2020s, however, the country had surpassed 100 million.



Geographic constraints, such as limited arable land and rainfall, have prevented agricultural production from keeping pace with population growth. Countries in similar situations to Egypt exist throughout the Middle East and Africa, and these regions are structurally challenged by the lack of grain supplies from food exporters like Europe and the United States.



Many people perceive this simply as a problem of food inequality, but this simply ignores the explosive population growth in these countries that has caused this inequality in the first place. In reality, it's more a matter of imbalances between geographic conditions and population distribution. This imbalance isn't simply a matter of social justice. It's the result of the interplay of geography, economics, and climate.



Countries in dire need of food currently have large populations but significantly lack self-sufficiency and purchasing power. This structural imbalance, coupled with the disruption of the global food supply chain brought on by the climate crisis, could lead to disaster.",2,1765612648.0,overpopulation,0,1.0,False

Sometimes I like it, sometimes I don’t, depends on the mood.

Other times I’ll be curled up in a blanket watching my favorite show with some hot cocoa, and he’ll plop down beside me, reach under my blanket pull my legs out and put them in his lap. I try to politely say “Can I please have some space?” And he’ll again throw his hands up and storm off to his room like I super insulted him.

Now I know what you’re going to say; “Just have a sit down talk with him” and I’ve tried that, I just don’t know how to broach the subject in a way that doesn’t end with him mad or feeling insulted. I tried to tell him that I sometimes just want to have some space to myself and he’ll say something like “So, what? I’m just never supposed to touch you, like ever again?” And I’m like “No… I didn’t say that.” And it just ends up with us both being upset.

The tabloids had been merciless for weeks. “Selena Gomez Plays It Safe Again,” screamed one headline after a red-carpet appearance in a sleek black gown and her signature long, dark waves. “America’s Sweetheart Refuses to Take Risks,” sneered another, complete with side-by-side photos of her looking virtually unchanged since 2017. The word they kept using was “vanilla.” Safe. Predictable. Boring.

Selena read every article in the back of her SUV on the way home from a late-night talk show, the city lights streaking across the windows like accusations. She wasn’t angry at first—just tired. Then one particularly vicious blog post ended with the line, “At this point, Selena Gomez changing her hair would be bigger news than any movie she’s in.”

She stared at the phone screen until it blurred.

The next morning, she called Chris McMillan—her stylist of fifteen years—and told him, voice steady, “I want to go blonde. Like, platinum. And I want bangs. Real ones. The kind that hit my eyelashes.”

Chris paused so long she thought the call dropped. “Sel, are you sure? That’s… a lot of lift. And bangs are a commitment.”

“I’m sure,” she said. “Book the whole day.”

Twelve hours later she walked out of the salon with ice-blonde hair swinging just past her shoulders and thick, blunt fringe that made her brown eyes look enormous. The paparazzi outside lost their minds. Phones flashed like gunfire. Within an hour #SelenaBlonde was trending worldwide. She posted one selfie—hair damp, bangs messy, middle finger barely in frame—and captioned it, Safe enough for you?

The internet exploded. Some called it a midlife crisis at thirty-three. Others called it iconic. Selena didn’t care. For the first time in years she felt the delicious burn of having done something reckless just because she wanted to.

Three weeks later she started shooting Echoes in the Dark, a psychological thriller in which she played Maya Delgado, a true-crime podcaster kidnapped by the very killer she’s been investigating. The script was brutal, intimate, and—most importantly—being directed by Luca Verdier, the French auteur whose last film had won the Palme d’Or. Luca had courted her for the role for two years. When she finally said yes, he’d wept on the phone.

The trouble started in pre-production, over one scene on page eighty-seven.

Maya, bound to a metal chair in an abandoned warehouse, taunts her captor until he snaps. In a fit of rage he grabs a pair of shears and hacks off her hair—first in violent, uneven chunks, then shorter and shorter until he finishes the job with electric clippers, leaving her nearly bald. It was meant to be the emotional nadir of the film: the moment Maya’s identity is literally stripped away.

Selena read it and felt her stomach drop.

“I’m not cutting my hair,” she told Luca flatly during their first chemistry read with Julian Kaye, the British actor playing the killer. “We can use a wig. Or VFX. Whatever it takes.”

Luca’s eyes softened behind his wire-rimmed glasses. “Selena, the scene is about violation. If the audience knows it’s fake, the moment dies.”

“I understand that,” she said, “but this is real hair I just bleached the hell out of. It’s taken thirty-three years to grow. I’m not shearing it off for ninety seconds of screen time.”

Julian stayed quiet, watching the negotiation like a tennis match.

Luca exhaled through his nose. “Fine. We will find a solution. Trust me.”

She wanted to trust him. She really did.

The morning of the warehouse scene, Selena arrived on set with her new blonde hair hidden under a silk scarf. The crew greeted her with the usual warmth, but she could feel the buzz of anticipation. This was the scene everyone had been whispering about for weeks.

Luca pulled her aside. “We’re going to do exactly as you asked,” he promised, squeezing her shoulders. “Wig lace, fishing line for the falling pieces, a little CGI cleanup in post. Julian will mime the cutting. You’ll be perfect.”

She studied his face and decided to believe him.

They shot the dialogue first—Maya spitting venom while Julian’s character circled her like a shark. The binds on her wrists and ankles were real (safety clips hidden beneath the rope), and the metal chair was freezing against her bare back. By the time Luca called for the haircut portion, Selena was deep in character, tears streaking her cheeks, voice raw.

Julian picked up the shears—dulled for safety, she’d checked herself—and began the pantomime. Snip, snip, snip in the air beside her head. Pre-cut bundles of blonde hair extensions, glued to fishing line, dropped to the floor in perfect choreography. The sound department added the metallic slice of scissors in post. It was flawless.

Selena relaxed a fraction. Almost over.

Julian leaned in, breath hot against her ear, and whispered, “I’m sorry, love,” so quietly she almost missed it.

Then the cold metal touched her real hairline.

The first cut was surgical—straight across her forehead, severing her brand-new bangs in one brutal snip. The severed fringe fluttered to the warehouse floor like a dead bird.

Selena’s scream was not acting.

Julian didn’t stop. He sawed through the length at her jaw, blonde strands raining down her shoulders. The crew stood frozen. Someone’s coffee cup slipped and shattered.

“Cut!” Selena shrieked. “Luca, CUT!”

But Luca didn’t call cut. He stood behind the monitor, arms folded, watching.

Julian switched to smaller scissors now, carving the remaining hair into a jagged bob that barely brushed her chin. Selena thrashed against the ropes, tears no longer manufactured. The safety clips snapped; her wrists bled.

“Stop! Stop it, please—”

Julian set the scissors down, almost gently, and picked up the clippers. They buzzed to life with a sound like an angry hornet. He started at her forehead and plowed a stripe straight back, blonde velvet piling on her lap. Again. Again. The vibration rattled her teeth. Within ninety seconds she was left with half an inch of pale stubble.

The clippers clicked off.

Silence rang louder than any scream.

Julian stepped away, face unreadable. Luca finally approached, crouching so they were eye level.

“Selena,” he said softly, “look at me.”

She couldn’t. She was staring at the mountain of her own hair on the concrete, shimmering like spilled gold.

“That was the most honest piece of acting I’ve ever seen,” Luca continued. “You felt real terror. Real loss. The audience will feel it in their bones.”

“You lied to me,” she whispered.

“I gave you truth,” he countered. “And you gave me genius.”

She started to shake—with rage, with cold, with the sudden terrifying lightness on her scalp. A production assistant draped a blanket over her shoulders. Someone else swept the hair into a trash bag like evidence.

Luca stood. “We have one more setup. The final reveal when Maya sees herself in the cracked mirror. For that… it needs to be skin.”

Selena laughed, a broken sound. “You want me to shave it bald. Actually bald.”

“It’s the only way the reflection reads as shocking on camera,” he said. “I brought a kit. Professional. You can do it yourself, in private, when you’re ready. Or we can reshoot everything with a bald cap and pray the lace never shows.”

He placed a small black dopp kit in her trembling hands.

Selena stared at it for a long time.

Then she stood up, letting the blanket fall, and walked to the portable makeup trailer alone. She locked the door, sat on the closed toilet lid, and opened the kit.

Inside: a cordless Wahl shaved bald every day of his life, a can of shaving cream, a safety razor, and a bottle of aftershave balm.

She turned on the clippers again—no guard this time—and ran them over her head herself, watching the last half-inch of blonde disappear into the sink. The sensation was alien, exhilarating, awful. When only pale fuzz remained, she lathered her scalp with cream that smelled like eucalyptus and took the razor in shaking fingers.

Stroke by stroke, she erased what was left of the old Selena.

When she stepped out twenty minutes later, the set had cleared except for Luca and the camera operator Anna. Selena’s scalp gleamed under the practical fluorescents, strangely elegant, the shape of her skull delicate and fierce.

Luca’s eyes filled. “Thank you,” he said simply.

They shot the mirror scene in one take. Maya—no, Selena—stared at her reflection and saw a stranger: hollowed cheeks, huge wet eyes, naked skull. She touched the glass with bound hands and began to laugh, the sound splintering into sobs. It was the most frightening, alive thing she’d ever put on film.

Six months later, Echoes in the Dark premiered at Venice.

The ten-minute standing ovation started the moment the final frame cut to black. Critics who’d spent years dismissing Selena as “pretty but limited” wrote things like “a career-redefining supernova” and “the bravest performance by an American actress this century.” The haircut scene—uncut, unflinching—became instant film-school legend. Young actors tattooed the date of the premiere on their wrists.

Selena attended every festival bald and unapologetic. She wore backless gowns that showed the elegant curve where hair used to fall. She let photographers shoot her scalp from every angle. When talk-show hosts asked if she missed her hair, she smiled and said, “I miss a lot of things. But not that version of me.”

One night in Toronto, a little girl with chemotherapy alopecia approached her outside the theater, clutching a Sharpie.

“Miss Gomez… will you sign my head?”

Selena knelt, uncapped the marker, and wrote in looping script across the child’s smooth scalp: You are enough.

Then she pressed a kiss to the crown of the girl’s head and walked into the spotlight, shining like a comet that had burned away everything unnecessary to reveal its core.

And somewhere, in the back of her mind, she could still hear the buzz of clippers—like a lullaby made of metal and nerve—reminding her that sometimes the most terrifying choice is the one that sets you free.The tabloids had been merciless for weeks. “Selena Gomez Plays It Safe Again,” screamed one headline after a red-carpet appearance in a sleek black gown and her signature long, dark waves. “America’s Sweetheart Refuses to Take Risks,” sneered another, complete with side-by-side photos of her looking virtually unchanged since 2017. The word they kept using was “vanilla.” Safe. Predictable. Boring.

Selena read every article in the back of her SUV on the way home from a late-night talk show, the city lights streaking across the windows like accusations. She wasn’t angry at first—just tired. Then one particularly vicious blog post ended with the line, “At this point, Selena Gomez changing her hair would be bigger news than any movie she’s in.”

She stared at the phone screen until it blurred.

The next morning, she called Chris McMillan—her stylist of fifteen years—and told him, voice steady, “I want to go blonde. Like, platinum. And I want bangs. Real ones. The kind that hit my eyelashes.”

Chris paused so long she thought the call dropped. “Sel, are you sure? That’s… a lot of lift. And bangs are a commitment.”

“I’m sure,” she said. “Book the whole day.”

Twelve hours later she walked out of the salon with ice-blonde hair swinging just past her shoulders and thick, blunt fringe that made her brown eyes look enormous. The paparazzi outside lost their minds. Phones flashed like gunfire. Within an hour #SelenaBlonde was trending worldwide. She posted one selfie—hair damp, bangs messy, middle finger barely in frame—and captioned it, Safe enough for you?

The internet exploded. Some called it a midlife crisis at thirty-three. Others called it iconic. Selena didn’t care. For the first time in years she felt the delicious burn of having done something reckless just because she wanted to.

Three weeks later she started shooting Echoes in the Dark, a psychological thriller in which she played Maya Delgado, a true-crime podcaster kidnapped by the very killer she’s been investigating. The script was brutal, intimate, and—most importantly—being directed by Luca Verdier, the French auteur whose last film had won the Palme d’Or. Luca had courted her for the role for two years. When she finally said yes, he’d wept on the phone.

The trouble started in pre-production, over one scene on page eighty-seven.

Maya, bound to a metal chair in an abandoned warehouse, taunts her captor until he snaps. In a fit of rage he grabs a pair of shears and hacks off her hair—first in violent, uneven chunks, then shorter and shorter until he finishes the job with electric clippers, leaving her nearly bald. It was meant to be the emotional nadir of the film: the moment Maya’s identity is literally stripped away.

Selena read it and felt her stomach drop.

“I’m not cutting my hair,” she told Luca flatly during their first chemistry read with Julian Kaye, the British actor playing the killer. “We can use a wig. Or VFX. Whatever it takes.”

Luca’s eyes softened behind his wire-rimmed glasses. “Selena, the scene is about violation. If the audience knows it’s fake, the moment dies.”

“I understand that,” she said, “but this is real hair I just bleached the hell out of. It’s taken thirty-three years to grow. I’m not shearing it off for ninety seconds of screen time.”

Julian stayed quiet, watching the negotiation like a tennis match.

Luca exhaled through his nose. “Fine. We will find a solution. Trust me.”

She wanted to trust him. She really did.

The morning of the warehouse scene, Selena arrived on set with her new blonde hair hidden under a silk scarf. The crew greeted her with the usual warmth, but she could feel the buzz of anticipation. This was the scene everyone had been whispering about for weeks.

Luca pulled her aside. “We’re going to do exactly as you asked,” he promised, squeezing her shoulders. “Wig lace, fishing line for the falling pieces, a little CGI cleanup in post. Julian will mime the cutting. You’ll be perfect.”

She studied his face and decided to believe him.

They shot the dialogue first—Maya spitting venom while Julian’s character circled her like a shark. The binds on her wrists and ankles were real (safety clips hidden beneath the rope), and the metal chair was freezing against her bare back. By the time Luca called for the haircut portion, Selena was deep in character, tears streaking her cheeks, voice raw.

Julian picked up the shears—dulled for safety, she’d checked herself—and began the pantomime. Snip, snip, snip in the air beside her head. Pre-cut bundles of blonde hair extensions, glued to fishing line, dropped to the floor in perfect choreography. The sound department added the metallic slice of scissors in post. It was flawless.

Selena relaxed a fraction. Almost over.

Julian leaned in, breath hot against her ear, and whispered, “I’m sorry, love,” so quietly she almost missed it.

Then the cold metal touched her real hairline.

The first cut was surgical—straight across her forehead, severing her brand-new bangs in one brutal snip. The severed fringe fluttered to the warehouse floor like a dead bird.

Selena’s scream was not acting.

Julian didn’t stop. He sawed through the length at her jaw, blonde strands raining down her shoulders. The crew stood frozen. Someone’s coffee cup slipped and shattered.

“Cut!” Selena shrieked. “Luca, CUT!”

But Luca didn’t call cut. He stood behind the monitor, arms folded, watching.

Julian switched to smaller scissors now, carving the remaining hair into a jagged bob that barely brushed her chin. Selena thrashed against the ropes, tears no longer manufactured. The safety clips snapped; her wrists bled.

“Stop! Stop it, please—”

When I was little, I spent a lot of time on my grandparents’ horse farm, helping any animal that needed care. In high school, I became fascinated by animal anatomy and science, and I thought veterinary medicine was the perfect career — especially with the promise of a stable financial future.

Now that I’m taking more specialized courses, though, I’m starting to get cold feet. I worry about whether I could handle live surgeries or the responsibility of putting an animal down. Growing up, I was never allowed — nor did I want — to be present when my grandparents killed animals for food. Later, when I witnessed the slaughter process of a sheep, I had to close my eyes during the stunning. While I can respectfully handle animals after death, I’m realizing that the realities of veterinary work may not align with my strengths or values.

Instead, I find myself drawn to a different dream: owning a flower shop and café where people can read, enjoy coffee, and pick out a bouquet. Even though I grew up on a farm, I’ve always loved gardens — the artistry, the science, and the joy of making someone smile with flowers I arranged myself. If not that, I could see myself working at a winery, though I know the financial side of starting a business would be a major challenge. I’m still figuring out whether I want to take that risk, but I know I want a career that blends creativity, science, and the ability to bring happiness to others.

To help gain clarity, I’m planning to job shadow a veterinarian and see firsthand what the work is really like. In the meantime, I’d really appreciate hearing other people’s perspectives and advice. If you’ve gone through similar doubts or explored different career options, I’d love to know what helped you make your decision.",1,1765611484.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False

\- I currently have a Lenovo Legion 7i 2024 14900HX + 4090 setup, 64gb (not oled, 16 incher). Performs great with anything I throw at it. Bought it on sale and I have no regrets...except...

\- My current laptop weighs like a ton -- and due to the demands of my work nature, I tend to travel a lot. Bringing my current laptop around is starting to feel like a huge hassle. I also want to shift from working from home to be able to work outside (coffee shops or wherever).

\- I'm now looking into a more portable friendly laptop, but still can dish it whenever I want to play current games (BF6 or CoD, a lil bit of Dota 2, etc). 

*Just to add, I'm also about to buy a 27 inch OLED monitor soon.*

\--

Right now in SE Asia, the best laptops I've seen that might answer my 'portable but still more than capable' issue are:

Asus Zephyrus G16 2024 - 185H, 4090, 32gb, 2TB SSD - around 1.9-2k USD  
Asus Zephyrus G14 2025 - HX370, 5080, 32gb, 2TB SSD - around 2.4k USD

(there's a significant price diff for both, which I don't mind..memory is fine too)

\--

Current thoughts:

\- I like the idea of the G16 due to the larger screen, not really a fan of the 185H and since the 4090 is limited to a lower wattage, it feels like a downgrade from my current laptop. Still, I'm thinking it should perform closely to my Lenovo. I tried the latest G16 in the Asus concept store (i reckon it's the same) and it feels kinda big for portability, but waaaay lighter. Very premium, macbook-y feeling.

\- I like the idea of the G14 too as it's waaaay portable, but I'm worried about reviews of its fan being way too loud when gaming. I use a Llano v12 cooler at home, but I think this won't fit the G14? This doesn't exactly feel like an upgrade specs wise, but it's next gen compared to my Legion 4090 lappy so mehh. I've seen reviews the G14/16 5080 can trade blows with a full watt 4090. Screen doesn't seem that small, but I might feel this when using at home (but yeah, I do plan to get that monitor).

So for portability + gaming when needed, is the G16 2024 still worth it? Or should I go all in for portability G14 and call it a day?

*The 5070ti is also available for the G14, but I can push to a 5080 so I didn't include it*

\--

TLDR:

HELP ME CHOOSE (like in topic) -- portability + a laptop that can seriously game when I want to!

Hello everyone,

I (40F) don't even know what I expect to get from this, but I do feel very alone as of late. My husband left me 2 months ago, and I am finding out that who I thought were my friends are not.

I have tried joining local groups and even apps like BeFriend or Wink, but nothing is working. I don't understand what's wrong with me or why I cannot make new friends, but I am lonely, and I have no one to talk to... I also have no direct family support, as I live in the UK, but all my family is in Spain. I just need people to have conversations that go a bit deeper than the weather or what you've done at the weekend.

I recently sprayed Devotion completely blind, with no idea of the notes; I was intrigued. Devotion isn’t groundbreaking, but it offers a refreshing take on a mainstream masculine scent.

Devotion starts off with a distinct coffee note, but it is immediately muted by the sharpness of lemon. The lemon adds brightness to the composition, while the coffee and patchouli create an earthy yet clean aroma.

I don’t know how popular this fragrance is, as it doesn’t follow the usual sweet, vanillic trend of most designer scents. I suspect if this had been released by a brand like Masque Milano, DS & Durga, Maison Crivelli, or Byredo, it would be more popular. I now need to get my nose on the Parfum version.

1plf8vh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1plf8vh,₹90–₹150 for a café-grade coffee at your office desk. Are Indian offices even ready for this?,"Quick thought experiment for people working in Indian offices.

Imagine this on your desk during a long workday.
You open a cup, add water, stir, wait about 5 minutes, and the coffee heats itself. It stays comfortably warm for the next 15–20 minutes. No microwave, no running to the pantry.

Important context before reacting: the main goal here is not the self-heating part. The main goal is the coffee itself.

This is not meant to be like typical instant coffee brands that compromise on taste by using cheaper beans. Most mass brands work with Arabica beans around ₹300 per kg. The idea here is to use premium café-grade beans in the ₹1500–₹1600 per kg range, the kind used in good cafés. It would still be instant in format, but positioned as a genuinely premium coffee. The self-heating is just an added convenience, not the selling point.

Pricing, just to be clear upfront:
Single-use cups would be around ₹90–₹120 for regular and ₹139–₹149 for flavoured variants.
If people like the taste and convenience, there could also be a kit version priced around ₹250–₹300, which can make about 3–5 cups of coffee before being thrown out.

I’m not selling anything here. I’m trying to understand behaviour.

So the real question is not “should this exist”, but this:
Are Indian office workers actually willing to pay for better coffee at work, or are we still a “cheap coffee is fine” market?
Would you personally ever choose this over pantry coffee or delivery, and in what situation?
At what price does it stop making sense for you?
Where does this fit and where does it absolutely not?

If this had to sit on your desk one day, what would you change to make it worth coming back to again and again?

Honest answers matter more than polite ones.

I initially booked my appointment to donate Plasma as I had recently read an article that said my area/city needed more plasma donations and I read that its a bit more lenient on the requirements (not true btw) but, unfortunately my veins are too small. Luckily enough, they had the ability/time to switch my donation to a whole blood donation and even though it took two different people to find a vein—I did it! I was so nervous every single stage, from the sign in process/questionnaire, haemoglobin test (was right on the cusp) and the whole finding a vein thing was more annoying than anything. My veins are always a bit of a challenge (to the point I typically end up with an IV in my foot or at least 4 different punctures to get some flow) but, when you find the spot it doesn’t stop?! Luckily—the person initially trying to find my vein called in the big guns (reinforcements from a well seasoned pro)— the pro found the perfect vein, I filled up the sack in 6 minutes and I even squirted blood at them when they were trying to end the session. 

Even if I wasn’t eligible to give plasma, I did manage to give whole blood and I was told my blood type
Is needed in my area so that was cool! I felt perfectly fine after my donation but, as a first time donor they made me refuel/wait for 5 minutes before I could leave. As a coffee addict (I work as a barista and took the day off just for this so the withdrawal was crazy), I was so glad to finally have my first coffee of the day at an hour that I usually go for my 5tjh, had some lactose free chocolate milk and a phenomenal molasses cookie  as I waited. Due to the crazy uber prices and my recent unemployment, I had to walk for about 1.5 hours to get home as the bus in my area wasn’t anywhere close and uber prices were quadruple the usual price. I was a little tired when I got home but, I think it was mostly from the trudging through a shit tonne of snow in shoes that give me blisters as I fight through the other blisters they i tidally gave me.

Cool thing is my province has a project to help study how to enable/support the process for Black AFAB people to replenish their haemoglobin/iron sources post donation and I consented to participating. Hopefully I can commit to taking these iron pills more than I do when my doctor prescribes them 😅 

Anyway, LETTTSSSS GOOOOOOOO!!! Waiting on my stem cell swab kit and the next time I can donate something.

But what a nite for the wagon, Jalen Johnson! He had 13 AR by halftime and covered this line wit ease in the 3rd quarter. I honestly did not think he would come out in the 4th quarter, but I truly appreciate the Quinn Snyder for bringing his starters out in a blowout game in the 4th quarter (Cade didn't even had to come out to close out this game) because I wanted him to record his 3rd straight trip-dub, which he did!

**Matchup:** I remember Giga Chikadze was one the feared featherweight in this division, but he has fell off the top of division to now a gatekeeper role. He's fought top tier fighters like Arnold Allen, (prime version of) Calvin Kattar, David Onama, and Edson Barboza, but he's only won 1 of those four matchups and it was against a washed Edson Barboza back in 2021. Not to mention that he got utterly dominated by Calvin Kattar in a 5-round bout main event in 2022, not winning a single round of the fight in the judges' scorecard and you're going against a young phenom who has all the tools to become a champion? Gimme Kevin Vallejos -5.5 all day! He's got 1 loss in his MMA career (16-1, 2-0 in UFC). His lone loss was against top contender Jean Silva in the past on the Dana White Contender Series and he loss 2 rounds to 1. I would not be suprise if he puts him away. 

**The Play & Prediction :** I kno Giga is durable, but it's not outside of realm that Vallejos can finish him, but instead of adding more risk by method, I'll take the safer route wit the points, that is the play. 1.1U on Kevin Vallejos -5.5 (-110). Vallejos win by decision (30-27 (x2) and 29-28)

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

Après avoir longtemps lurké sur ce sub et épluché des centaines de threads, j'ai franchis enfin le pas. Je voulais commencer par vous dire un grand **merci**. Vos discussions techniques et vos retours d'expérience m'ont évité bien des erreurs de débutant et m'ont aidé à naviguer dans la jungle des marques et du matériel.

Mon objectif était clair : me monter un setup V60 complet de bonne qualité, capable de m'accompagner dans mon apprentissage (et au-delà), sans dépenser des sommes déraisonnables (j'y viendrais surement par la suite me connaissant, mais chaque chose en son temps)

Après beaucoup de lectures, d'analyses, de calculs, d'optimisations, de comparaison (et deux commandes séparées pour gratter les meilleurs prix 😅), voici le résultat pour un budget total de **354€** (Je suis en France)

Je partage ce récapitulatif détaillé et les raisons de mes choix pour offrir un raccourci à ceux qui voudraient se lancer dans cet univers, mais qui n'ont pas forcément la patience d'y consacrer 3 jours de recherches comme je viens de le faire 😅 !

* **Moulin : Timemore C3S Pro -** **74,95 € chez Brewout.** C'était le choix le plus stratégique du setup. Contrairement aux moulins d'entrée de gamme classiques (souvent en céramique ou avec trop de jeu), celui-ci embarque les meules **S2C 660** (Spike-to-Cut) en acier inoxydable. Concrètement, ça pré-coupe le grain avant de le broyer, ce qui réduit drastiquement les ""fines"". J'ai pris la version **""S""** (tout métal, pas de plastique interne pour une meilleure durabilité) et **""Pro""** (poignée pliable, pratique pour le rangement). Pour moins de 75€, c'est ce qui se rapproche le plus de la qualité de la référence du marché (**Comandante C40 MK4 Nitro Blade**) qui coûtent le triple.
* **Balance : Timemore Black Mirror Basic 2 - 59,95 € chez Brewout.** Choix ""rationnel"". Je voulais éviter deux extrêmes : la balance de cuisine à 15€ (qui a souvent un ""lag"" de 2 secondes à l'affichage, fatal pour la précision) et la fameuse **Acaia Pearl** (la référence des pros, mais à plus de 250€).

Pourquoi ce modèle ? D'abord pour le contrôle de la température au degré près (indispensable pour ne pas brûler les torréfactions légères). Mais surtout pour son **bec verseur breveté**. Contrairement aux cols de cygne classiques qui demandent un sacré coup de main, celui-ci est conçu pour garantir un écoulement à 90° (parfaitement vertical) et régulier, même si on tremble un peu. La taille de 600ml permet une chauffe ultra-rapide (moins d'inertie thermique) et la rend beaucoup plus maniable qu'un ""tank"" d'un litre.
* **Dripper : Hario V60 Switch (02) - 36€ chez Maxicoffee.** Là j'ai pas hésité, c'est ce que je suis venu chercher (en grand fan du Japon). J'ai juste choisi la version Switch pour sa polyvalence. Je peux faire du V60 classique, mais l'option ""immersion"" me rassure pour mes débuts !

I used to own the home at 77 SE Woodward so I am pretty familiar with Hawthorne, Sellwood and Mt Tabor. One of my main reasons to invest in the city again is I am craving more arts and music in my life. I am also interested in biking more. The Oregon Coast is fairly limited in venues in comparison and riding a bike is downright dangerous. I want to learn to play my fiddle more and maybe even get lessons as well as listen to other music venues. For that reason Hawhorne is on my list of considerations.

I am okay with the West side of town, but pretty sure I prefer the less refined (gritty in a good way) feel of the East Sides. NW area (the Pearl especially) is probably my least favorite part of the city. (Don't hate on me it's all just preferences). I am okay with 21st area but don't really like how compressed the area is and what a parking nightmare it can be. So let's stick to the East unless I am missing some really special area to consider.

I didn't spend too much time in North or NE Portland when I lived in SE so I am very interested in exploring these areas on my hunt. I am going to visit Alberta again and Mississippi and St John's. I used to go to Alberta all those years ago but am completely unfamiliar with the other two areas but was told they might provide what I seek.

2. What areas should I absolutely avoid as a single woman?

I’m in my mid-20s, currently based in Bangalore, and I’m realizing life is way more fun when you have someone to share spontaneous plans with.

A bit about me:

	•	I love music (always down for playlists, gigs, or random late-night conversations about songs)

	•	Big on travel - weekend trips, unplanned getaways, or “let’s leave at 6 AM” kind of energy

	•	I genuinely enjoy meeting new people and discovering interesting perspectives

	•	I have way too many fun hangout ideas around Bangalore (coffee hops, sunset drives, random walks, food hunts)

What I’m looking for:

Someone who believes weekends are for:

	•	Trying Japanese food (or any food, really 🍣)

	•	Making spontaneous plans

	•	Saying “why not?” more often than “maybe next time”

If you’re curious, fun, and think memories > routines, let’s talk and see where it goes. No pressure, just good vibes and interesting conversations.

-Tryx Panorama SE 360 ARBG 360mm AIO 
-Thermaltake toughpower GF3 1200W 80+ Gold power supply.

I flashed to bios 3.25 before ever booting up the first time. That was the latest bios revision at the time. I ran with this since May. I shut the PC off at night, I have hibernation disabled running Win11 Pro. 

I use this for gaming. Everything was solid up until about a month and a half ago. It started with a very occasional boot issue. Didn’t even look at the code. Reset and it booted right up. 

About 3 weeks ago it got bad. 75% of the time I get 03 code on MB. 15% of the time it makes it past that and hangs on 97 error. With some time and lots of resetting it boots into windows and runs flawless. Always runs flawless when it boots.

I have reseated GPU twice, pulled RAM, swapped the sticks around, ran each one individually and pulled CPU. CPU and MB socket look flawless.

I have an issue where my breaker will trip if someone is using the toaster or something of the sort while the coffee maker is heating up. I have a commercial BUNN coffee maker that keeps the water tank hot at all times. 

This breaker tripping takes out the PC as well. So I’ll be hot and heavy gaming in WOW, Ark Ascended, or something of the sort and the power will get cut. It has probably happened to it 15 times.

It is now on a UPS to prevent this again.

I’m down to replacing the power supply and hoping that is the issue due to the breaker tripping maybe damaging the Power supply….im just guessing.

If I get the 03 error my keyboard never gets power, no video and can’t even get to bios. I just am not sure if the CPU is bad because it will eventually boot and be flawless. That 97 error sometimes is throwing me off too….

Please give suggestions. I do plan on ditching the Asrock and getting the MSI X870E Carbon WIFI MB.

The cost of living has been utterly soul crushing. 

I'm disabled so on a fixed income and by the time rent, bills and food have been paid, I'm left with next to nothing in my account. 

I'm glad there's safety nets and other help out there but it's getting harder and harder as time goes by to make ends meet. 

It used to not be too bad. 

About 10 years ago, I could actually pay my rent and bills, have a bit extra in the pantry and actually have enough left over to go out once and a while for a nice meal or coffee with friends (nothing too flashy) or actually save enough to go out of town to see family and friends who I don't see often come the holidays. 

Nowadays, I only leave the house a few times a week and tie it in with other errands like groceries. 
I also use those times to go visit friends and socialize which helps keep my relatively sane and not feel as lonely as I usually do. 

I also have reduced my meals to one a day come dinner time to save on costs. 
I've done one meal a day for years now so pretty used  to it. 

I also use my crafting skills to help subsidize my income a bit but in this economy, less and less people have disposable income for such things. 

I know many people are feeling this way and I really feel for them especially this time of year. 

A lot of us are just worn out and tired of being exploited and squeezed for every dollar we have. 

From rising rent, continuously increasing grocery and power prices to the cost of fuel and all the other little things, it's beginning to get to a point beyond insanity. 

When is it all going to stop?

When are we all going to stand up and say ""that's enough!""?

This is not living. It's existing. 

I miss being able to do the little things like going out with friends or doing a mini-adventure somewhere just out of town for a change of scenery. 

I miss not going to the supermarket and actively recoiling at the price of things knowing that I'm going to have to be very careful and plan accordingly. 

I miss not worrying if my winter power bill will be so bad that I'm going to have to miss a meal or two so I can keep the lights on. 

For what it's worth, I can call myself lucky that l have a roof over my head, a warm bed to sleep in and food to eat. 

I know full well not everyone has that and I will always try my best to help where I can if another is in need. 

We need community now more than ever so please, check in on your friends, family and neighbors. 

Make sure they're doing okay.

I've never been particularly good, peaking D1 on EUW with Kayle, being kind of handless and relying on macro to get there (once). But in the past months it so happened that I started playing a lot of games between 20 to 30 hours without sleeping, and while fasting for long periods too. Also started caffeine such as coffee and redbulls. And the results were really surprising, I felt like I gained a superpower in that state. When I was handless before, now in those hours I was easily hand diffing everyone, even playing hard mechanical champion with good success. I also was less emotional, sharper, smarter... It made me realize how bad I am in the default state that I played in for years. I sort of gained talent for the game but it only manifested sleepless and fasting with added caffeine. I had some crazy carry performances, many in a row... Then I would go to sleep, wake up, eat something, try to play and I would be sooo bad. I eventually stopped playing without that special state because it wasn't worth it, I would be just too bad without it. But waiting for the state to trigger was obviously not pleasant, especially doing it consistently, and the state was stressful too, so eventually my body rebelled and for about a week I haven't played league... Also despite it giving me clear advantages, I haven't progressed my rank meaningfully, maybe due to other problems such as playing past the best point, or before it, or not focusing on one strategy/role which I'm trying to do but can't. I don't know what to make of it, the state was addicting because it made me carry games, but it is surely unhealthy, and factually lead me to sort of a crash out in the end too. From what I've tried to understand, it might have something to do with prefrontal cortex or ADHD, which I suspect in myself? Has anyone heard of this? Is it a universal rule for other players?

I would sleep for 10-12 hours and still feel like I need to sleep more. It was seriously affecting my will to live, like if I had no energy to endure my obligations. 

But this week I started to drink regular coffee again (2 portions, 2-3 small spoons per day in total) and I can feel it improves my endurance, like I can still feel I'm tired bc of getting up early and working in my factory job but it just feels like I can handle it without doom thinking and rioting in my head against the fact that I have to work. Seems like finally I start to feel again like all my other coworkers around - kinda tired, but still willing to act. I can sleep for 6-8 hours and I have no bigger issues with getting up in these last few days. 

To give a very specific example: this week I had a morning shift. I get up at 3:50 am. ""Normally"", in last few months, the morning shifts were the worst and I already started to feel like dying after first 2-3 days of working. After going back from work, technically I had like 4-6 hours for myself but almost no will to do anything, and just going early to the bed. But THIS week, right now it's Saturday morning and I'm at work (an extra working day) and I genuinely don't feel like I hate being here. I didn't feel like about to pass out during this whole week. I can feel some tiredness but it's very dull, like if my endurance spiked. 

I don't know if the problem is that I work a physical job, three shifts and I simply can't keep going without coffee. Maybe you guys can quit coffee because you have less physically demanding jobs? Or is the problem with the fact that I was still consuming some caffeine, even if it was less than 1 teaspoon per day? 

All I see here so far are positive experiences so I wonder if I'm just one of those who simply can't function without it, or I'm not doing exactly what you did, or my job is just too tiring to handle it without caffeine. Any suggestions? ",5,1765607087.0,decaf,2,1.0,False
