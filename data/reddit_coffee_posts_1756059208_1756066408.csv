I have about 13ft of a wall that has a few cabinets, coffee bar and pantry. 

My wife want to convert the whole wall to cabinets and pantry and coffee inside the cabinets also. 

Plan is, use sanded birch ply wood and was going to make 24”x24”xheight tbd. But she has asked me a few questions and want to get opinions. 

The sheets come in 4x8. So I can make a pantry cabinet as wide as 4ft. Those of you who have experience here I’d like to know your thoughts on the value of a wider pantry cabinet vs 2 of the 2ft wide. 

Pantry would be bottom of drawers up to probably 4ft with shelving storage above that. 

My concerns are weights of storage in a 4 ft wide drawer. (Imagine 4x2 of cans) 

Alternatives are 4 ft wide top, with a split width bottom and have 2ft wide drawers side by side. (I know not actually 2ft, we are using that for simple communication) 

Another question is the rockler adjustable shelving metal parts. Can they be paired with any of their drawer sliders? So that I can have adjustable height drawer slides? 

Thank you in advance for your experience and thoughts on this.

1mz5zg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/VEO3/comments/1mz5zg7/the_complete_ai_video_generation_strategy_that/,The complete AI video generation strategy that took me from $0 to $5k/month (everything i learned),"this is 1going to be the longest and most comprehensive post but it covers literally everything that works for profitable AI video creation…

Started 11 months ago with zero video experience, $500 in generation credits, and no plan.

**Now generating $5000+ monthly revenue from AI video content with systematic, repeatable processes.**

Here’s the complete strategy that actually works.

# The foundational mindset shifts:

## **From creative to systematic**

AI video success isn’t about artistic inspiration. It’s about systematic processes that produce predictable quality.

## **From perfectionism to selection**

Don’t try to generate perfect content. Generate volume and select exceptional results.

## **From random to data-driven**

Track everything. What works, what doesn’t, why, and under what conditions.

## **From platform-agnostic to platform-native**

Create specifically for TikTok, specifically for Instagram, specifically for YouTube. Don’t reformat.

# The technical foundation:

## **Structured prompting system**

```
[SHOT TYPE] + [SUBJECT] + [ACTION] + [STYLE REFERENCE] + [CAMERA MOVEMENT] + [AUDIO CUES]
```

**Example that works:**

```
Close-up, cyberpunk hacker, typing frantically, Blade Runner 2049 cinematography, slow dolly forward, Audio: mechanical keyboard clicks, distant sirens
```

## **Reference-based styling**

Stop using “cinematic” and “professional.” Use specific references:
- **Camera equipment**: “Shot on Arri Alexa,” “Shot on iPhone 15 Pro”
- **Director styles**: “Wes Anderson framing,” “David Fincher precision”

- **Movie references**: “Blade Runner 2049 cinematography,” “Her lighting”

## **Systematic seed approach**

Test seeds 1000-1010 for new concepts. Build seed libraries for different content types:
- **Tech content**: Seeds 1002, 1007, 2156 consistently work
- **Lifestyle content**: Seeds 1334, 1445, 2223 reliable

- **Action content**: Seeds 2047, 2334, 2889 perform well

# The content strategy framework:

## **Volume-based quality approach**

Generate 8-15 variations per concept, select best 2-3 for development.

**Hit rate improvement**: From 10% with single generations to 70+ with selection approach.

## **Platform-specific optimization**

Create different versions for each platform from the start:

**TikTok optimization:**
- 15-30 seconds duration
- High energy from frame 1

- Obvious AI aesthetic works (don’t hide it)
- Hook within first 3 seconds

**Instagram optimization:**

- 25-35 seconds for Reels
- Visual perfection priority
- Smooth, cinematic flow
- Aspirational/shareable content

**YouTube optimization:**
- 45-60 seconds for Shorts
- Educational or entertaining value

- Professional execution quality
- Longer hook development (5-8 seconds)

## **Content multiplication strategy**

One core concept becomes 12+ pieces of content:
- 4 style variations (cyberpunk, cozy, professional, artistic)
- 3 platform optimizations each
- Series/follow-up potential

# The cost optimization breakthrough:

## **Google’s pricing reality:**

- $0.50 per second generation
- $30+ per minute of content (if perfect first try)
- Factor in failed attempts: $150+ per usable video
- Monthly learning budget: $3000+ unsustainable

## **Alternative access discovery:**

Found companies offering veo3 at 60-70% below Google rates.

Been using these guys for 8 months - same API, same quality, dramatically lower cost.

**Cost reduction enables:**
- Volume testing approaches
- Platform-specific creation

- Systematic experimentation
- Profitable content creation

# The technical execution system:

## **Audio cue integration (criminally underused)**

Audio makes AI video 10x more engaging:

**Cyberpunk content**: “Electronic humming, keyboard clicking, distant sirens”
**Lifestyle content**: “Coffee shop ambience, gentle conversation, morning sounds”

**Action content**: “Footsteps running, environmental sounds, dynamic audio”

## **Camera movement optimization**

Simple movements work better than complex combinations:
- **Slow dolly in/out**: Most reliable, professional feel
- **Orbital around subject**: Great for reveals, product content
- **Handheld follow**: Adds energy without chaos

- **Static with subject movement**: Often highest technical quality

## **Negative prompt quality control**

Always include baseline:

```
--no watermark --no warped faces --no floating limbs --no text artifacts --no blurry edges
```

Prevents 80% of common AI generation failures.

# The workflow optimization system:

## **Weekly structure:**

- **Monday**: Performance analysis, concept planning (2 hours)
- **Tuesday-Wednesday**: Batch generation sessions (6 hours total)
- **Thursday**: Selection and platform optimization (4 hours)
- **Friday**: Finalization and scheduling (2 hours)

**Total: 14 hours weekly for 20+ finished videos**

## **Daily generation approach:**

**Morning**: Tech/cyberpunk content

**Afternoon**: Lifestyle/aspirational content
**Evening**: Action/creative content

Batching by content type maintains consistency and efficiency.

# The reverse engineering advantage:

## **Viral content analysis workflow:**

1. Find viral AI video (500K+ views)
2. Ask ChatGPT: “Break this into technical prompt components”
3. Generate verification using AI breakdown
4. Create systematic variations by changing individual elements

**Result**: Understanding WHY content works instead of guessing.

## **Formula library building:**

After reverse engineering 200+ viral videos:

```
Cyberpunk formula: RED Dragon + Blade Runner style + neon lighting = consistent engagement
Portrait formula: iPhone 15 Pro + Rembrandt lighting + natural grade = reliable quality
Action formula: Handheld + high contrast + dynamic audio = energy and retention
```

# The platform performance optimization:

## **Algorithm-specific considerations:**

**TikTok algorithm prioritizes:**
- Initial engagement rate (first 3 seconds crucial)
- High energy, emotional response content
- Shareability and comment generation

**Instagram algorithm values:**
- Visual quality and aesthetic perfection
- Profile visit rates from content

- Save rates for later viewing

**YouTube algorithm focuses on:**
- Watch time percentage and completion rates
- Click-through rate from thumbnails
- Educational or entertaining value

# The business model implementation:

## **Revenue streams developed:**

- **Direct content monetization**: Platform ad revenue, sponsorships
- **Client video creation**: AI video services for businesses
- **Educational content**: Teaching AI video techniques
- **Template/preset sales**: Successful prompt formulas and seed libraries

## **Scaling approach:**

- **Systematic documentation**: Everything that works gets documented
- **Team workflow integration**: Systems designed for collaboration
- **Automation where possible**: Batch processing, scheduling, tracking
- **Quality consistency**: Repeatable processes over creative inspiration

# The performance tracking system:

## **Metrics that matter:**

- Cost per video (target: $15-25)
- Engagement rate by platform (track separately)
- Viral potential indicators (early engagement velocity)
- Revenue per video (track monetization success)

## **Pattern recognition analysis:**

Weekly review identifies:
- Which content types perform best seasonally
- Successful prompt formulas and their consistency

- Platform-specific optimization effectiveness
- Cost-effective generation strategies

# Advanced techniques integration:

## **JSON prompting for reverse engineering:**

Use when copying existing viral content - better systematic breakdown than text prompts.

## **Seed bracketing for quality control:**

Systematic testing of seed ranges 1000-1010 for consistent quality patterns.

## **First frame optimization:**

Generate 10+ variations focusing only on perfect opening frame - determines entire video success.

## **Platform-native creation:**

Different technical approaches for each platform rather than reformatting approach.

# The competitive advantages discovered:

## **Cost structure advantage:**

70% cost reduction enables approaches that competitors can’t afford.

## **Systematic quality advantage:**

Consistent quality through processes rather than hoping for inspiration.

## **Volume-based learning advantage:**

Generate 10x more content than perfectionist competitors, learn patterns faster.

## **Platform-specific optimization advantage:**

Native creation for each platform while competitors use one-size-fits-all.

# Common expensive mistakes avoided:

1. **Perfectionist single-generation approach** - costs 5x more for worse results
2. **Fighting AI aesthetic** - uncanny valley kills engagement
3. **Platform-agnostic content creation** - missing platform-specific optimization
4. **Random generation without systematic learning** - no improvement over time
5. **Ignoring audio elements** - missing 50% of engagement potential
6. **Vague prompting instead of specific references** - inconsistent, unpredictable results

# The long-term strategic insight:

**AI video creation is becoming commoditized. Competitive advantages come from:**
- **Systematic processes** over creative inspiration
- **Cost-effective access** over expensive direct pricing

- **Platform-specific optimization** over generic content
- **Data-driven improvement** over intuitive guessing
- **Volume-based selection** over perfectionist approaches

# Results after 11 months:

**Content output**: 200+ videos created, 150+ published across platforms

**Average performance**: 25K views per video, 12% engagement rate
**Viral success rate**: 8% of content achieves 100K+ views
**Revenue generation**: $5000+ monthly through multiple streams
**Time investment**: 15 hours weekly for systematic content creation
**Cost efficiency**: $18 average per finished, platform-optimized video

# The future of AI video creation:

**Trends emerging:**
- Cheaper access through third-party providers enables volume approaches
- Platform algorithms increasingly favor AI-native content over hidden AI
- Educational content about AI techniques performs exceptionally well
- Systematic creators outperform artistic creators consistently

**Opportunities for next 12 months:**
- AI video technique education market growing rapidly
- Platform-specific AI content becoming its own category
- Business AI video services scaling massively

- Tool development for systematic AI video creation

this complete strategy took 11 months to develop and cost $3000+ in learning expenses. sharing everything hoping to save others the expensive trial-and-error phase.

**The biggest breakthrough: treating AI video creation as a systematic business process rather than a creative hobby.**

1mz5yel,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1mz5yel/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_bodum_bistro/,Explore the Best Electric Kettle Bodum Bistro Worth Buying or Not,"The Bodum 11451-01US Bistro electric kettle has quickly become a vital part of my daily routine, and not just because I drink an unhealthy amount of tea during the workday. From the first time I tried it, I could see why people rave about this BPA-free plastic kettle. It's small, lightweight, and doesn't take up half the counter like some of the bulky kettles I've owned in the past. For a tiny 17-ounce device, its efficiency is impressive.

**Design and Build**

This kettle’s sleek design fits perfectly in almost any kitchen setup. It’s available in black, which looks modern and matches well with various appliances. The BPA-free plastic material is lightweight but feels sturdy enough to withstand regular use. I also love how compact it is; measuring 7""L x 4""W x 7.75""H, it doesn’t hog counter space, making it especially great for smaller spots like dorms, RVs, or even office desks. A water level indicator on the side is helpful, especially when trying to hit the perfect measurements for one or two cups.

**Performance and Efficiency**

I’ve been genuinely impressed by how quickly this kettle heats up. With a rapid-boil function powered by 700 watts, it takes under four minutes to boil the full 17-ounce capacity. That’s enough for about three to four cups of tea, which is usually more than I need for a single round. The heating element is tucked away at the bottom, meaning there’s no exposed part to worry about and it's safe to place on any surface. Honestly, the speed and efficiency of this kettle make it stand out from some pricier competitors I’ve used before.

**Convenience Features**

What makes life easier with this kettle is its manual on/off switch paired with the indicator light, which feels straightforward yet reliable. Another standout feature is the steam sensor that ensures the kettle turns itself off once the water hits boiling, giving me extra confidence that I won’t accidentally burn the thing out if I forget to switch it off. I’ve tested it multiple times over weeks, and the auto shut-off has been flawless every time. It feels like a small kitchen workhorse.

[Check Bodum 11451-01US price on Amazon.](https://cncgn.com/p/b00851lrr6/)

**Capacity and Suitability**

The 17-ounce capacity is perfect for someone like me who rarely needs boiling water for a crowd. It’s efficient for single servings or small households, but might feel limiting if you’re someone who’s always entertaining guests or brewing large pots of coffee. For those situations, the 34-ounce version could be a better choice. I’d say this model is ideal for students, minimalists, or anyone in need of a rapid, hassle-free kettle.

**Highlights**

- Compact and space-saving design  
- BPA-free plastic construction ensures safe, clean boiling  
- Rapid-boil feature perfect for busy mornings or quick cooking  
- Auto shut-off and built-in steam sensor enhance safety  
- Lightweight and easy to handle  

**Weaknesses**

- Small capacity isn't ideal for larger families or group settings  
- No adjustable temperature settings for specialty teas  
- Plastic exterior might not appeal to those who prefer stainless steel  

**Competitive Options**

Comparing this kettle to others, the Bodum Bistro holds its own fairly well. For instance, the Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle often boasts a larger capacity and stainless steel build. However, it’s bulkier and takes up more counter space, which is a deal-breaker if you’re working with limited room like I am. On the opposite end, premium kettles like Breville Smart Kettle have cutting-edge features like temperature control, but the price is significantly higher. Honestly, the Bistro offers just what most people need—fast boiling, safety features, and a compact design—without forcing you to pay for unnecessary extras.

**Price Performance**

For what it offers, this kettle feels like a solid bang for your buck. Sure, there are cheaper models out there, but they often lack features like the auto shut-off or rapid-boil. Plus, those kettles rarely make a statement on the counter like this sleek and modern design does. Overall, this device balances performance, safety, and affordability quite well, making it a worthwhile choice for simple boiling needs.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Indiana Fever vs. Minnesota Lynx: A Tale of Two Teams (One With Injuries, the Other With a ""Plan"")**

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your popcorn and brace yourselves for a WNBA showdown that’s less “Game of Thrones” and more “Injury Report: The Musical.” The Indiana Fever, currently limping into Minneapolis like a shopping cart with three broken wheels, face the Minnesota Lynx, who’ve got the swagger of a team that just won the WNBA version of *Survivor*. Let’s break this down with the precision of a stathead and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many sports drinks.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Lynx Are the Favorite (Spoiler: It’s Not the Fever’s Strength)

The numbers don’t lie, and in this case, they’re screaming, “Minnesota, baby!” The Dimers.com model gives the Lynx an **85% chance to win**, which is about the same odds as a cat not knocking over your coffee mug. The moneyline has the Lynx at **-800**, implying bookmakers think they’re nearly a 90% favorite. For context, that’s the confidence level of a toddler certain they’ve mastered the art of parallel parking.

The spread is **Minnesota -12**, meaning the Lynx are expected to win by a score that’d make a mathematician blush. The total is set at **167-168 points**, suggesting a high-scoring affair—though with the Fever’s current roster, “high-scoring” might just mean “less embarrassing.”

---

### Injury Report: Indiana’s Roster vs. a Box of Broken Pencils

The Fever’s injury list reads like a who’s-who of “WNBA’s Most Valuable Absentees.” Caitlin Clark, their star guard, is out with a **groin injury**, adding to her 15-game absence. Sophie Cunningham, Aari McDonald, and Sydney Colson are all season-long DNP due to injuries, leaving Indiana with the roster stability of a house of cards in a hurricane. New addition Aerial Powers? She’s the team’s latest “solution,” which is about as reassuring as a umbrella in a tornado.

Meanwhile, the Lynx are thriving in their absences. Minnesota has won **5 of 7 games without Napheesa Collier**, who’s returning from a sprained ankle. Coach Cheryl Reeve isn’t overloading Coll

1mz5wn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mz5wn9/the_shape_of_things_to_come_part_1/,The Shape of Things to Come (Part 1),"My name is Sam, and I think my roommate is dissecting things in his bedroom.

That’s a strange sentence to write. It sounds like the beginning of a joke, or something you’d say to a resident advisor to get a room change. But it’s not a joke, and I can’t tell anyone. If I was wrong, I could be in trouble for defamation. And if I was right… could he come after me?

His name is Julian. We were assigned to each other by the university’s housing algorithm, a process that apparently saw two aspiring doctors from different sides of the state and thought, “perfect.” For the first month, it seemed to be right. We got along. Not in a best-friends-for-life kind of way, but in the easy, functional manner of two people whose ambitions are perfectly aligned. Our lives were a shared rhythm of lectures, late-night study sessions fueled by cheap coffee, and the mutual, bone-deep terror of organic chemistry.

We were both in the same gross anatomy lab, Section B. That’s where I first noticed Julian was… different. The lab is a rite of passage, designed to weed out the weak, or so they say. But for our generation, raised with unrestricted internet access, the shock wears off fast. We’ve seen it all before, filtered through a screen. The first time they roll back the sheet on your cadaver, there’s a jolt, a smell, a sudden confrontation with mortality that no video can prepare you for. But you adapt. It becomes clinical. It becomes work. At least, until you see the first babies. The fetal specimens, floating in their jars of formalin, perfect and pale. That’s the thing that gets under your skin. That’s the thing that reminds you that this isn’t just a puzzle of flesh and bone.

Most of us coped with a kind of gallows humor, a clinical detachment that felt like a suit of armor. We gave our cadaver a nickname, “Manny,” and we spoke about him with a forced, professional respect that barely concealed our unease.

Julian needed no such armor. He approached our cadaver, a frail old man whose skin was the color of old parchment, with a focus that was less clinical and more… reverent. His movements were precise, economical, almost beautiful. While the rest of us fumbled with our scalpels, making ragged, uncertain cuts, Julian’s incisions were clean and perfect. He seemed to know the landscape of the human body before he’d even opened the textbook.

“He has an anomalous origin of the vertebral artery,” he’d murmured one afternoon, his voice a low hum of concentration. He was pointing to a vessel deep in the neck.

Our TA, a third-year med student named Chloe, came over. She peered into the cavity, her expression skeptical. “No, that’s standard. It’s branching from the subclavian, right where it should be.”

“Look closer,” Julian said, without looking up. “The root. It’s a millimeter too high. It’s a common variation, but it’s there.”

Chloe looked closer. She pulled out a probe and gently shifted the tissue. Her eyebrows shot up. “Huh. You’re right. We wouldn’t have even gotten to that for another two weeks. Have you been reading ahead?”

Julian just shrugged, a faint, almost imperceptible smile on his lips. “I like to be prepared.”

That was when the others started to notice. He was always prepared. He knew the name and function of every nerve, every muscle, every tiny, insignificant foramen in the skull. He didn’t just study the body; he seemed to understand it on an intuitive level, as if he were recalling something he already knew. His fascination wasn’t just academic. It was personal.

The weirdness at home started subtly. A new lock on his bedroom door. His habit of showering at odd hours, always after midnight. And then, the smell.

It was about three weeks ago. I came back from a late study group, the dorm hallway quiet and smelling of stale pizza and air freshener. As I got to our door, I noticed another scent underneath it all. A chemical sharpness that made the hairs on my arms stand up. Formaldehyde. I told myself I was imagining it, that I was just carrying the scent home from the lab on my own clothes, my own skin.

But the next night, it was there again. Stronger this time. And it was definitely coming from under Julian’s door. I knocked. The soft sound of movement inside stopped. I knocked again.

“Julian? You okay in there?”

A long pause. Then, his voice, muffled. “Fine, Sam. Just studying.”

The smell was gone by morning. But it came back a few nights later. And the night after that. It’s become a part of our apartment’s nocturnal atmosphere now. The low hum of the refrigerator, the distant sound of traffic, and the faint, sweet, sickening smell of a morgue seeping from my roommate’s locked room.

Last night, I heard a new sound. I was up late, cramming for a physiology exam, when I heard a noise from his room. It wasn’t loud. It was a soft, rhythmic scraping. A wet, precise sound, like a knife being carefully drawn through something dense and yielding.

I’m not going to the RA. What would I say? “My roommate studies too hard and our apartment smells like our anatomy lab”? They’d think I was crazy, or just trying to get a single room.

But I’m sitting here now, in the quiet of our living room, and the sun is starting to come up. Julian’s door is closed. The scraping has stopped. But the smell is still there, clinging to the air like a ghost. And I’m starting to think that whatever he’s preparing for, it has nothing to do with saving lives.",1,1756065865.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1mz5uzk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mz5uzk,New Central Government in Cap-Haïtien or Saint-Marc,"The focus on the violence in Port Au Prince has created a situation where communities in other parts of Haiti have largely been ignored. It is time those communities form a central government that is at the service of the Haitian people and their security. A lot of this plan involves things the new Haitian government needs to do in Haiti, other things are collaborations Haiti and DR need to do together. Please forgive any typos and please translate to *kreyòl*. 

Steps to a new Haiti.

1. Create a consortium to get the support of leaders of all towns and communities in Haiti outside of Port Au Prince. Get the mayors and city leaders of all of these towns to #joinin.  Have each town select two leaders to form a representative body for a new central government.

2. Establish a competing Central Government in Cap-Haïtien with the goal of eventually turning Saint-Marc into Haitis new Capital. Saint-Marc has some advantages that make it an excellent place to establish the new capitol. It is in an area of Haiti that has less seismic activity. It is centrally located and can be accessed from most parts of Haiti. It has access to critical rail infrastructure which will help it become a proper port city. Saint Marc is also a relatively safe city which will help bring stability to the nation.

Port Au Prince can no longer serve as the capital of Haiti. It is way too seismically active, partially destroyed, and it is currently controlled by gangs. There needs to be an established Haitian government in a stable place in order to reconquer and stabilize Port Au Prince. You can't create a government in a war zone. Future governments should seek to depopulate Port Au Prince through economic opportunities in other parts of the country, a new capital, and through future relocation programs. Port Au Prince really needs to become a small historical town with a smaller number of earthquake grade buildings to house a smaller population. Haitians need to leave Port Au Prince. 

3. Once the support of all Haitian communes and towns is achieved, begin drafting a constitution. Send representatives to Santo Domingo along with a signed declaration from all Haitian communes to request Dominican recognition of this new Central Government as the legitimate government of Haiti.  This is important as it will help the new central government gain international legitimacy, aid, and assistance for the next phase. Getting the backing of your next door neighbor is the first step. If the Dominican Government doesn't initially recognize the new central government, keep pushing forward and making allies until they eventually are forced to.

4. Create an armed militia to tackle Port Au Prince. Haiti needs a military. Composed mostly of men between the ages of 18 and 40, the military should be part of a voluntary citizens militia. This will mean the recruitment of men and women in port au prince and other cities in Haiti. The UN and countries in Latin America like Brazil & Mexico could help provide the necessary training and weapons for these armed interventions.  The goal being to reestablish order in the Port Au Prince. So far the current Haitian government has had some moderate success through drones and hired mercenaries. These options should also be on the table. 

5. Once Port Au Prince is recaptured, form a census consortium. Haiti has not had a national census since 2003. Haiti needs to know the number of citizens it has to properly allocate resources to them.

6. Haitian Creole should be the official language of government. No documents should be translated to French and no government work should be done in French. Formal education in Haitian Public Schools should be in Haitian Creole. Spanish should be taught as a secondary language in Haiti to facilitate contact between Haitians and the countries neighboring them and bring a wealth of important literature and media to the country. Since the majority of the Haitian populace does not speak french, it should not be the formal language of law. The common people of Haiti should be able to know what is being written in legal documents so that they can make informed decisions in their country.

7. The New Haitian Government will recognize the Gaude & Dominican Peso as co-official currencies but will eventually begin the process of converting to the Dominican Peso. A single currency in the Island of Hispaniola will bring the necessary stability to Haiti. Haitians will be able to build savings and wealth through a currency that is relatively stable. It will also improve commerce between both countries as products will be able to be sold between both countries without the need to do conversions. It will also reduce the disadvantageous that Haitians have had when selling their products to DR. 

8. Economic Ideas 

**Toursim**

\-Begin designating lands in Haiti's North Coast for Beach Tourism. The Haitian government can start by building a few small resorts in these regions with the goal of eventually getting private investors to purchase land to convert into resort property. This should all be done while still giving the Haitian Public access to public beaches. Once security is established in Port Au Prince, the Haitian government should establish a small number of resort towns in the south. These towns should be built with earthquakes in mind. 

\- Modernize Cap Haïtien ports to receive cruise tourism.

\- Begin Arranging Bus Tours to Cities lIke Cap Haitian from the Dominican Republic. Currently in the Dominican Republic, many wealthier Dominicans travel to more obscure parts of the island like Cabo Rojo. By establishing proper bus tours, you can reintroduce Haiti to the Dominican populace and eventually the rest of the world. This will help improve relations between both countries. 

\-Establish national parks and nature tourism spaces in the Tiburon Peninsula. The Tiburon Peninsula is one of the few parts of Haiti and Hispaniola that has a lot fairly undisturbed forests. This would make great spaces for tourists wanting to visit national parks and undisturbed rain forest ecosystems.

\-Hispanola is a centrally located island in the Americas. By building a Large International Airport in St. Marc, Haiti can become a Hub for connecting flights between South America, Europe, and North America. In order to do this the Haitian Government would have to secure a number of major airlines and private investors to establish flight routes and build a modern airport. 

**Medical Tourism**

\-Begin working on building out new hospitals across Haiti and revitalizing older hospitals. 

\-Build Pilot Health Spas and Cosmetic Hospitals in Cap Haïtien. Eventually pushing Haiti as a destination for aesthetic procedures. 

\-Begin encouraging Haitian medical students to stay in Haiti through scholarships and a 10 year stay requirement. 

**Industrial Growth**

\-Begin working with foreign clothing and textile companies to reinvest and expand manufacturing in Caracol.

\- Begin the production of other important industrial products for Haiti such as Cement, Industrial Metals, and other construction supplies/equipment. 

\-Work with clothing factories to make uniforms for government employees, police, and military. Encourage companies in Haiti to give employees uniforms. This worked in Japan during their post war period.

\-Implement a mandatory work schedule of 60 hours per week during the initial emergency period. 

Infrastructure:

Initial infrastructure projects should focus on the revitalization of frequently used and important roads, repairing critical water infrastructure, and connecting Haitians to power. The Hatian government should work out a plan with the Dominican Republic to connect Haiti to the Dominican Power Grid. Initially this will be expensive for Haitians as they will be purchasing power from the DR. This can be counter balanced through the building of large numbers of Solar Arrays and wind turbines in Haiti which will return power to the grid. 

Connect the country to broadband internet and improve cell service across the country. This will bring an economic explosion to the country and will allow for the creation of other service industries like call centers in Haiti. 

9. State Communication:

The new Haitian Central government needs to establish frequent communication with the Haitian people. They will need to hire a minister of communication and a social media team. This will build trust in government systems and services. In the initial phases of this plan,  government officials will need to address the nation every night during the formal transition to Haitis new constitution and during the armed interventions in Port Au Prince. One thing Haiti is missing is a good propaganda wing to its government. 

Establish a culture of empathy in both schools and in public life. One of the horrors many Haitians have witnessed is the way the population fights for resources during catastrophes. This is a failure to establish a culture of empathy. This starts with campaigns aimed at asking kids how the things they do can make others feel. Other campaigns should involve education of proper water sanitation, trash disposal, farming practices, & disease prevention.

10. Agriculture & Reforestation

\- With the help of foreign institutions and the man power of Haitian teenagers, begin replanting trees in Haiti. These trees in 60 years will become a source of national pride and a natural barrier from Hurricanes. 

\- Haiti needs to implement major agricultural reform with proper education for farmers. Some methods Haitians could benefit from are 

**Farming & Crop Management:**

* **Agroforestry** – Planting crops together with trees (fruit, timber, nitrogen-fixing) to restore soil fertility, provide shade, reduce erosion, and give farmers multiple income sources.
* **Contour farming & terracing** – Planting along slopes and building stone barriers or terraces to reduce runoff and soil loss.
* **Cover crops & mulching** – Using beans, peanuts, or grasses to protect soil, add organic matter, and improve fertility naturally.
* **Composting & organic fertilizers** – Turning crop waste and animal manure into compost instead of relying on imported chemical fertilizers.

* **Crop diversification** – Growing a mix of staples (maize, beans, cassava, rice), vegetables, and cash crops (mango, cacao, coffee) to reduce risk and improve nutrition.
* **Intercropping** – Planting multiple crops together (e.g., corn + beans + squash) to maximize yields, improve soil, and reduce pests.
* **Resilient crop varieties** – Using drought-tolerant, fast-growing, and climate-adapted seeds.
* **Community seed banks** – Preserving local varieties and reducing dependence on expensive imports.

**Water management**

*  **Rainwater harvesting** – Building small reservoirs, cisterns, and rooftop collection to ensure irrigation during dry periods.
* **Drip irrigation** – Efficient, low-water-use irrigation systems that can run off gravity tanks.
* **Watershed restoration** – Reforesting upland areas to help regulate rivers and protect farmland from floods

  
Conclusion: I know that this list is not through or fully detailed or even close to complete. But I hope it serves as starting point. As a Dominican I want to see Haiti Succeed. ",2,1756065757.0,haiti,0,1.0,False

TL;DR 
 
SPY is rangebound between 636 and 646 as volatility persists. Sector performance is mixed, with leadership in discretionary, energy, and materials, while consumer staples and utilities underperformed. Earnings season is heating up with PDD, SMTC, NVDA, BABA, OKTA, DG, MRVL, KSS, and BMO all set to report, led by Nvidia’s defining AI and semiconductor results. Fed data, inflation, and economic releases will guide near-term market tone. Bitcoin is steady near 114,800 and Ethereum is at 4,900 near resistance. IPOs and SPAC activity are growing, with BlackRock’s coffee IPO drawing attention.  


 
 
The market is navigating key [SPY](https://flic.kr/p/2roWLDn)levels at 636 support and 646 resistance. Mixed sector performance dominated the week, with leadership seen in consumer discretionary, which gained 3.04%, energy up 2.04%, and materials adding 1.98%. Defensive consumer staples were flat at 0.00% as risk-on sentiment pulled flows away from safe havens. Analyst sentiment reflects cautious optimism, with a balanced view on direction as volatility remains elevated.  

Significant news flow included Barclays upgrading Altria’s price target, BlackRock filing for a new coffee IPO, and positive compliance updates from CYCU on NASDAQ. The EU is advancing its digital stablecoin initiative, signaling broader regulatory acceptance of blockchain adoption. Domestically, CSX announced a new international services deal with BNSF, strengthening logistics, while the U.S. President announced an investigation into furniture tariffs.  

Consumer discretionary led markets with a gain of 3.04%, followed by strength in energy at 2.04% and materials at 1.98%. Financials rose 1.65%, while industrials gained 1.63%, both benefitting from stable macro conditions and flows into cyclicals. Technology advanced 1.36% with semiconductors in focus, while healthcare added 0.82% and utilities rose by 0.54%. Consumer staples showed no movement, underperforming as money rotated out of defensive positioning.  

 
The near-term spotlight is on PDD Holdings and Semtech (SMTC), both reporting Monday. PDD’s international e-commerce performance could drive volatility in consumer discretionary, while SMTC’s results may influence sentiment across semiconductors and technology stocks broadly.  

Looking ahead, earnings from BMO, Alibaba (BABA), Okta (OKTA), Kohl’s (KSS), Nvidia (NVDA), Dollar General (DG), and Marvell Technology (MRVL) are expected. Nvidia’s results are the clear market focus, likely serving as a bellwether for the AI and semiconductor narrative. Marvell’s data will highlight semiconductor performance beyond Nvidia, while Okta provides a look into cloud and cybersecurity growth. Alibaba’s results shed light on international consumer demand as trade and tariff policy headlines evolve.  

New Home Sales and remarks from Fed officials Logan and Williams, could shift rate expectations and market psychology. Financials and real estate, which already gained 1.65% and 1.58% this week, may react strongly to any change in rate-related forward guidance. Inflation data remains moderate, supporting a cautious but constructive outlook and allowing selective risk-taking. Dip-buying strategies are emerging within sectors affected by inflationary worries but showing underlying strength.  


Global tension remains a background risk, though secondary to earnings and Fed discussions this week. Key developments include the EU accelerating its digital stablecoin regulatory framework, boosting fintech and blockchain sentiment, and renewed U.S. focus on trade policy with an investigation into furniture tariffs. The logistics sector was given a lift by the CSX-BNSF international deal, which strengthens cross-border services and supply chains.  


Rotation into growth and cyclical names was evident, with discretionary, energy, materials, financials, and industrials all gaining solid traction. Defensive sectors underperformed, with consumer staples flat while utilities rose only slightly. This reflects investors moving away from defensive positioning and leaning into risk exposure in the face of moderating inflation and steady interest rate expectations.  


BlackRock filed for a coffee-focused IPO, underscoring investor appetite for consumer-facing plays. Market participants are also watching several SPAC and smaller IPOs expected to debut next week with themes concentrated in green energy, biotech, and fintech.  

 
Bitcoin remains in consolidation near the 114,800 level, holding firm above key support. A breakout above 120,000 could open new upside momentum, while a breakdown would create risk of a retrace toward 110,000. Ethereum is trading around 4,853, near resistance. If broken, this could fuel renewed altcoin participation and expanded dominance within decentralized finance markets.  


Unemployment claims remain stable, emphasizing ongoing labor market resilience. Retail sales data continues to demonstrate strength, offering support to consumer discretionary stocks that already outperformed strongly in the latest sector rotation.  


SPY continues showing technical strength. Support stands at 636, while resistance remains at 646. The Money Flow Index is above 50, confirming positive inflows, while the Directional Movement Index shows +DI exceeding -DI with a strong ADX, validating trend strength. Price action remains supported above the Displaced Moving Average, which keeps bullish momentum intact. Overall, SPY is trading in a consolidation zone. Breaking above 646 would confirm breakout momentum for the next leg higher, while a drop below 636 would risk undermining the short-term bullish structure.",1,1756065697.0,Badboyardie,1,1.0,False

In a short period my calorie intake dropped to 700 kcal/day. I know it is not good but my brain is making me believe it is the only way to do my best to tackle this.

I am meditating and after years of therapy I learned to handle my anxiety suprisingly well. But not this time. I want to follow the rules so much that I am shivering (?), clenching my jaw and sucking my stomach in. Reading both subs (sibo and fodmaps) gives me information but the contradicting research and experiences makes me think I am not enough to filter.

E.g. Finding the root cause after 60-pages of test results and unsuccessful strict diets..seems impossible.

How did you get rid of this high level of anxiety about diet? Also, did you have success with low fodmap diet?

....

My history with SIBO treatment:

Tested positive for SIBO (no IMO), 2 weeks of Xifaxan, no relief. After Xifaxan my eczema started to blow up, rashes on my body, even my eyes were irritated and swollen. My hair and skin started to be extremely oily so I should have washed my hair twice a day. These symptoms are now better, I can handle it.

But I can't handle the diet.
My recommendation was normal diet during Xifaxan (2 weeks) and then starting the low fodmap diet for no longer than 6 weeks. Then a detailed list for the reintroduction phase. 

I started low fodmap by using Monash app, hoping that it makes the medicine easier to eradicate the bacteria. After a couple of days I felt worse, bloating and no bm for days. I realised there might have been fodmap stacking, but by the end of the Xifaxan treatment I could start my diet recommended by a dietetician. (As it was recommended the first place)
I was still struggling, even with the proper meal spacing, I lowered the portions etc. I realized my afternoon coffee is making my bloating worse, so I just stopped drinking that.

As I felt horrible after the meals I decided to restrict even more as it was impossible to see if I have a reaction from a specific fodmap. I wanted to have a couple of bloating-free days so by the and of the elimination phase, I will be able to identify triggers.

So yeah…… unattainable. 
Also taken. 
And the type that relishes the attention so even if by some amazing miracle you’re the lucky one chosen, you’d know he’s always checking out other women- but more than that , having heated eye contactships wherever he goes.

So it’s a lost cause 
And yet… I hold on to these feelings for him and this fantasy , for what???

  1  
  
  THE NINETY-SIX-YEAR-OLD MAN sat in his comfy armchair enjoying a book on Joseph Stalin. No mainstream publisher would touch the delusion-filled manuscript since the author had been unfailingly complimentary about the sadistic Soviet leader. Yet the self-published book’s positive opinion of Stalin appealed greatly to the old man. He’d purchased it directly from the writer not long before the latter was committed to a mental institution.  
  
  No stars could be seen hovering over the elderly man’s large estate because of a storm moving inland from the nearby ocean. Though he was wealthy and living in great luxury, his personal needs were relatively simple. He wore a decades-old faded sweater, his shirt collar secured all the way to his fleshy neck, which was thick with wattles. His cheap pants lay loose over his skeletal and useless legs. The hypnotic drum of rain on the roof had begun and he settled farther back in his chair, content to delve into the mind and career of a madman who had killed tens of millions of people unlucky enough to live under his cruel fist.  
  
  The old man occasionally laughed at something he read, at least the particularly gruesome parts, and nodded his head in agreement over passages where disciples of Stalin explained his graphic methods for the destruction of all civil liberties. In the Soviet dictator he clearly saw the leadership qualities necessary to drive a country to greatness while also causing the world to shake with terror. He tilted down his thick spectacles and glanced at his watch. Nearly eleven o’clock. The security system went on promptly at nine, with every door and window professionally monitored. His fortress was secure.  
  
  A crack of thunder seemed to cause the lights to flicker. They sputtered twice more and fluttered out. In the lower-level electronics room the battery backup in the security system had been removed, causing it to cease functioning when the power supply was interrupted. Each door and window was instantly disarmed. Ten seconds later the massive backup generators kicked in and brought the electrical flow back to full power, returning the security system to online status. However, within that ten-second span a window had opened and a hand had darted out and caught the digital camera that had been tossed from ground level. The window closed and was locked a second before the system armed once more.  
  
  Oblivious to this, the old man idly rubbed his hairless head; it was mottled over with scabs and patches of sun-damaged skin. His face had collapsed long ago into a pile of gravity-ravaged tissue that pulled his eyes, nose, and mouth downward into a permanent scowl. His body, what was left of it, had followed a similar route of degradation. He relied on others to help him perform the simplest tasks now. But at least he was still alive, when so many of his brothers in arms, indeed perhaps all of them, were dead, many by violent means. This made him angry. History showed that inferiors were perpetually jealous of those greater than them.  
  
  He finally put down his book. At his age three or four hours’ sleep at a time was all that was required, but it was now that he required it. He called for his attendant by pushing the blue button on the small circular device he always wore around his neck. It had three buttons, one for the attendant, one for his doctor, and one for security. He had enemies and ailments, but the attendant was mostly for pleasure.  
  
  The woman entered. Barbara had blonde hair and was dressed in a hip-hugging white miniskirt and tank-top blouse that allowed him a liberal view of her breasts as she bent down to help him up into his wheelchair. He had insisted on her wearing revealing clothing as a condition of employment. Old, rich, perverted men could do what they pleased. His wrinkled face nestled against her soft cleavage and lingered there. As her strong arms slid him onto the wide seat, his hand slipped under her skirt. His fingers glided along the backs of her firm thighs until they touched her buttocks. Then he gave each cheek a hard squeeze. He let out a small moan of appreciation. Barbara made no reaction because she was well paid to endure his groping.  
  
  She wheeled him to the elevator and they rode in the car together to his bedroom. She helped him undress, averting her eyes from his collapsed body. Even with all his fortune he could not force her to look at his nakedness. Decades ago she would have certainly looked at him, and also done so much more for him. If she wanted to live. Now he was simply helped on with his pajamas like an infant. In the morning he would be washed and fed, again like a baby instead of a man. The cycle was complete. From cradle back to cradle and then the grave.  
  
  “Sit with me, Barbara,” he commanded. “I want to look at you.” He said all this in German. That was the other reason he had hired her; she spoke his native language. There were few left around here who could.  
  
  She sat, crossed her long, tanned legs, and kept her hands in her lap, occasionally smiling at him because she was paid to. She should be thankful to him, he felt, because she could either work for him in this grand house where the tasks were easy and the time in between long, or else go whore herself on the streets of nearby Buenos Aires for what amounted to pennies a day.  
  
  He finally waved his hand and she immediately rose and closed the door behind her. He leaned back on the pillows. She would probably go to her room, strip off her clothes, leap in the shower, and scrub hard enough to rub the filth of his touch off her. He quietly chuckled at this image. Even as a shrunken old man he could have some effect on people.  
  
  He vividly remembered the glorious days when he would walk into a room, the heels of his knee-high officer’s boots clicking on the concrete floor. That sound alone would send ripples of terror throughout the entire camp. Now that was power. Every day he was given the privilege of feeling that sense of invincibility. His every command was carried out with no hesitation. His men would line up the vermin, long columns of them in their filthy clothes, their heads bowed, but still they eyed the shine of his magnificent boots, the power of his uniform. Playing God, he would decide which ones would die and which ones would live. The living hardly got the better of it, for their reward was a hell on earth, as painful and miserable and degrading as he could possibly make it.  
  
  He shifted to the left and pushed against a rectangle of paneling on his headboard. The piece of wood swung outward and his hand shakily punched in the combination on the safe door revealed there. He slid his hand in and pulled out the photo, then settled back on his pillow and looked down at it. He calculated that it was taken sixty-eight years ago to the day. His mind was still all there, even if his body had deserted him.  
  
  He was only in his late twenties in the picture, but he’d been given great responsibility because of his brains and ruthlessness. Tall and slender, he had light blond hair that was striking against his tanned, square-jawed face. He looked so fine in his full uniform with all his medals, though he had to concede that hardly any of them were actually earned. He had never seen combat since he had never been able to muster much personal courage. The talentless masses could fire the guns and die in the trenches. His skills had allowed him to seek safer ground. His eyes filled with tears at the sight of what he had once been; and next to him of course stood the man himself. He was small in stature, but colossal in every other way. His black mustache was frozen for all time over the expressive mouth.  
  
  He kissed his younger self in the photo and then did the same to the cheek of his magnificent Führer, completing his nighttime ritual. He returned the photo to its hiding place and thought about the years since he’d fled Germany months before the Allies marched in and Berlin fell. He’d come here by prearrangement because he’d seen the inevitable outcome of the war, perhaps before his superiors had. He’d spent decades in hiding but once more used his “talents” to build an empire of wea  
lth from mineral and timber exports in his new homeland, ruthlessly crushing all competition. Yet he longed for the old days, when the life and death of another human being was solely in his hands.  
  
  He would sleep comfortably tonight as he did every night, his conscience clear. He felt his eyelids growing heavy when he was surprised to hear the door opening again. He looked across the gloom of the chamber. She stood there silhouetted against the darkness.  
  
  “Barbara?”  
  
  CHAPTER  
  
  2  
  
  SHE CAME FORWARD after locking the door behind her. As she drew closer to the bed he could see that she was wearing only a cotton robe that barely covered her thighs and dipped low around the chest. Her tanned skin peeked out at him from several angles, except at the flap of the robe. There he could see the paleness of her revealed hip. She had loosened her hair and now it swept around her shoulders. She was also barefoot.  
  
  She slipped onto the bed next to him.  
  
  “Barbara?” he said, his heart beginning to beat faster. “What are you doing here?”  
  
  “I know you want me,” she said in German. “I can see it in your eyes.”  
  
  He whimpered as she took his hand and drew it inside the folds of her robe, near her breasts. “But I’m an old man, I can’t satisfy you. I… I can’t.”  
  
  “I will help you. We’ll take it nice and slow.”  
  
  “But the guard? He’s outside the door. I don’t want him to…”  
  
  She gently stroked his head. “I told him it was your birthday and I was your present.” She smiled. “I told him to give us two hours, at least.”  
  
  “But my birthday isn’t for another month.”  
  
  “I couldn’t wait.”  
  
  “But I can’t do it. I do want you, Barbara, but I am too old. Too damn old.”  
  
  She drew closer, touched him where he hadn’t been touched for decades. He moaned. “Don’t do this to me. I tell you it won’t work.”  
  
  “I’m patient.”  
  
  “But why would you want me?”  
  
  “You’re a very rich and powerful man. And I can see that you were once very handsome.”  
  
  He seized on this statement. “I was. I was. I have a picture.”  
  
  “Show me,” she said. “Show me,” she moaned into his ear as she moved his hand up and down inside her robe.  
  
  He pressed the panel, extracted the photo, and handed it to her.  
  
  Her gaze lingered over the image of him and Adolf Hitler. “You look like a hero. Were you a hero?”  
  
  “I did my job,” he said dutifully. “I did what was asked of me.”  
  
  “I’m sure you were very good at it.”  
  
  “I’ve never shown that picture to anyone else. No one.”  
  
  “I am flattered. Now lie back.”  
  
  He did so and she straddled him, unloosening her robe so he could see her body more fully. She also removed the call device from around his neck.  
  
  He started to protest.  
  
  “We don’t want the buttons to be pushed accidentally,” she said, holding it away from him. She bent down so her breasts were close to his face. “We don’t want to be interrupted.”  
  
  “Yes, you are right. No interruptions.”  
  
  She reached in her pocket and held up a pill. “I brought you this to take. It will help with that.” She motioned to his crotch.  
  
  “But I don’t know if I should. My other medications—”  
  
  Her voice dipped still lower. “You will last for hours. You will make me scream.”  
  
  “God, if I only could.”  
  
  “All you have to do is swallow this.” She held up the small pill. “And then take me.”  
  
  “Will the pill really work?” In his excitement a bit of spittle appeared on his lips.  
  
  “It has never let me down before. Now take it.”  
  
  She handed it to him, poured out a glass of water from a carafe on the nightstand, and watched as he swallowed the pill and greedily slurped down the water.  
  
  “Is it getting bigger?” he asked eagerly.  
  
  “Patience. And in the meantime I have something to show you.” From the pocket of her robe she pulled out a slim camera. It was the one that had been tossed to and caught by Barbara at her window when the power had gone off and the security system had disarmed.  
  
  “Barbara, I feel funny.”  
  
  “It is nothing to worry about.”  
  
  “Call the doctor to come in. Press the button for him. Do it now.”  
  
  “It is fine. It’s merely the effects of the pill.”  
  
  “But I can’t feel my body. And my tongue—”  
  
  “It feels large? My goodness. The pill must be working on your tongue and not on your other part. I will have to register a complaint with the manufacturer.”  
  
  The old man gurgled loudly. He tried to point to his mouth but his limbs wouldn’t work anymore. “Push the but—”  
  
  She moved the call device farther away and pulled her robe tight, cinching it up. She settled next to him. “Now, here are the pictures I want you to see.”  
  
  She turned on the camera. On the small screen an old black-and-white photo of a face appeared.  
  
  “This young boy was David Rosenberg,” she explained, pointing to the youthful but gaunt face on the screen; the hollow cheeks and glassy eyes indicated that death was not far away. “He never made it to his bar mitzvah. Did you know that before you ordered his death, Herr Colonel Huber? He was already past thirteen, but of course in the camps Jewish rites of passage were not observed.”  
  
  The old man continued to quietly gurgle, his terrified gaze still on the photo.  
  
  Barbara pressed a button and a young woman’s face appeared on the camera screen. She said, “This is Frau Helen Koch. She was killed by a rifle bullet to the belly fired by you before your first cigarette of the morning. By all accounts she only suffered for a mere three hours before expiring while your men kept back all attempts at aid by her fellow Jews. In fact, you killed two people that morning, since Frau Koch was pregnant.”  
  
  While the rest of his body remained immobile, the old man’s fingers started to claw the covers. His gaze was on the call device, but though it was only two feet away, he couldn’t reach it. She tilted his chin back and held it there so he had to gaze at the screen.  
  
  “You have to focus, Colonel. You remember Frau Koch, don’t you? Don’t you? And David Rosenberg? Don’t you!”  
  
  He finally blinked his assent.  
  
  “I would show you the pictures of the other people you condemned to death, but since there are over a hundred thousand of them, we don’t have time.” She pulled a photo from the pocket of her robe. “I took this from the frame on the piano in your beautiful library.” She held the picture in front of his face. “We found your son and daughter and your grandchildren and your great-grandchildren. All these innocent people. You see their faces. Just like David Rosenberg and Helen Koch and all the others. If I had time I’d tell you in exact detail how each will die tonight. In fact, seven of them already have been butchered simply because of their connection to you. You see, Herr Colonel, we wanted to make certain that there were no monsters left to reproduce.”  
  
  He started to cry, his mouth making little mewing sounds.  
  
  “Good, good, tears of joy, Herr Colonel, I’m sure. Maybe they will think our sex is so good you cry. Now it’s time to go to sleep, but keep your eyes on the picture. Don’t look away. It is your family after all.” When he closed his eyes, she slapped his face, forcing his eyes open. She leaned down and whispered into his ear in another language.  
  
  His eyes widened.  
  
  “Do you recognize it, Herr Huber? It’s Yiddish. You heard that phrase often in the camps, I’m sure. But in case you never knew the translation, it means, ‘Rot in hell.’ ”  
  
  She placed a pillow over his nose and mouth but did not cover his eyes, so he could see his doomed family as his last image during life. She pushed down with considerable strength. The old man could do nothing as his oxygen vanished. “This is a far easier way to die than you deserve,” she said as the pump of his lungs quicke  
ned, seeking air that wasn’t there.  
  
  After his chest lurched one final time, she removed the pillow and placed the picture of Huber in his uniform in the pocket of her robe, along with the small camera. They had not killed his family and had no intention of doing so. They did not murder innocent people. But they had wanted him to believe, with his final dying breath, that he had precipitated the destruction of his loved ones. They knew his death could never match the horror of the slaughter carried out on his orders, but this was the best they could do.  
  
  She crossed herself and whispered, “May God understand why I do this.”  
  
  Later, she passed the guard, a cocky young Argentine, on the way back to her room. He eyed her with obvious lust. She smiled back at him as she playfully twitched her hips, letting him glimpse some pale skin under her thin robe. “Let me know when it’s your birthday,” she teased.  
  
  “Tomorrow,” he said quickly, making a grab for her, but she darted out of the way.  
  
  That is very good, because I won’t be here.  
  
  She walked directly to the library and returned the photo to its frame. An hour later the lights flickered once more and then went out. The same ten-second gap occurred before the generator kicked on. Barbara’s window opened and then closed. Dressed all in black with a knit cap over her hair, she climbed down a drainpipe, skirted the perimeter security, clambered over the high wall around the estate, and was picked up by a waiting car. It was not that difficult since the security measures at the estate were chiefly designed to keep people out, not in. The driver, Dominic, a slender young man with dark curly hair and wide, sad eyes, looked relieved.  
  
  “Brilliant job, Dom,” she said in a British accent. “The timing on the power going out was spot-on.”  
At least the forecasters were right about the storm. Provided a good cover for my engineering sleight of hand. What did he say?”  
  
  “He spoke with his eyes. He knew.”  
  
  “Congratulations, it’s the last one, Reggie.”  
  
  Regina Campion, Reggie to her intimates, sat back against her seat and pulled off the cap, freeing her dyed blonde hair. “You’re wrong. It’s not the last one.”  
  
  “What do you mean? There are no Nazis like him left alive. Huber was the final bastard.”  
  
  She pulled the photo of Huber and Adolf Hitler from her pocket and gazed at it as the car raced along the dark roads outside Buenos Aires.  
  
  “But there will always be monsters. And we have to hunt down every one of them.”  
  
  CHAPTER  
  
  3  
  
  SHAW WAS HOPING the man would try to kill him, and he wasn’t disappointed. Seeing your freedom about to end with the distinct possibility of an execution date in your future just made some people a bit peeved. A few moments later the fellow was lying unconscious on the floor, the imprint of Shaw’s knuckles on his crushed cheek. Shaw’s backup appeared a minute later to take the man into custody. Shaw mentally crossed off his to-do list a heartless zealot who used unwitting children to blow up people who didn’t believe in the same god he did.  
  
  Ten minutes later he was in a car going to the airport in Vienna. Sitting next to him was his boss, Frank Wells. Frank looked like the meanest son of a bitch you would ever run into, principally because he was. He had the chest of a mastiff along with the beast’s growl. He favored cheap suits that were perpetually rumpled from the moment he put them on, and a sharp-edged hat that took one back several decades. Shaw believed that Frank was a man who’d been born in the wrong era. He would have done well in the 1920s and 1930s chasing criminals like Al Capone and John Dillinger with a tommy gun and not a search warrant or Miranda warning card in sight. His face was unshaven and his second chin lapped against his thick neck. He was in his fifties and looked older, with about eighty years of acid and anger built up in his psyche. He and Shaw had a love-hate relationship that, at least judging from the foul expression on the man’s face, had just swung back to hate.  
  
  A part of Shaw could understand that. One reason Frank favored wearing his hat inside cars and indoors was not simply to cover his egg-shaped bald head, but also to hide the dent in his skull where a pistol round fired by Shaw had penetrated. It was not an ideal way to begin a healthy friendship. And yet that nearly lethal confrontation was the only reason they were together now.  
  
  “You were a little slow on picking up Benny’s movements back there,” said Frank as he chewed on an unlit cigar.  
  
  “Considering ‘Benny’ bin Alamen is the holder of the number three slot on the Most Wanted Terrorists list, I’ll just take a moment to pat myself on the back.”  
  
  “Just saying is all, Shaw. Never know if it might come in useful next time.”  
  
  Shaw didn’t answer, primarily because he was tired. He looked out the window at the beautiful avenues of Vienna. He’d been many times to the Austrian capital, home to some of history’s greatest musical talent. Unfortunately, his travels here were always for work, and his most vivid memory of the town was not a moving concerto but rather almost dying from a large-caliber round that had come uncomfortably close to his head.  
  
  He rubbed at his hair, which had finally grown back. He’d had to scalp himself for a recent mission. He was only in his early forties, six and a half feet tall and in rock-hard shape, but when his hair had come back there’d been a sprinkle of gray at the temples and a dab at his sharp widow’s peak. Even for him the last six months had been, well, difficult.  
  
  As if reading his mind, Frank said, “So what happened with you and Katie James?”  
  
  “She went back to being a journalist and I went back to doing what I do.”  
  
  Frank rolled down the window, lit his cigar, and let the smoke drift out the opening. “That’s that, huh?”  
  
  “Why would there be any more than that?”  
  
  “You two went through some serious stuff together. Tends to draw people closer.”  
  
  “Well, it didn’t.”  
  
  “She called me, you know.”  
  
  “When?”  
  
  “While back. Said you left without saying good-bye. Just walked off into the sunrise.”  
  
  “Didn’t realize there was a law against that. And why didn’t she just call me?”  
  
  “Said she tried, but you’d changed your number.”  
  
  “Okay, so maybe I did.”  
  
  “Why’s that?”  
  
  “Because I felt like it. Any other personal questions?”  
  
  “Were you two sleeping together?”  
  
  This comment made Shaw noticeably stiffen. Frank, perhaps sensing he’d gone too far, looked down at the folder in his lap and said quickly, “Okay, we’ll be wheels up in thirty minutes. We can go over the next job on the wings.”  
  
  “Great,” said Shaw dully. He rolled down his window and breathed in the morning air. He did most of his work in the middle of the night and many of his “jobs” ended in the early morning hours.  
  
  I work for something loosely called an agency that doesn’t officially exist doing things around the world that none will ever know I did.  
  
  “Agency” policy allowed its operatives to go right up to the line of legality, often crossing it, sometimes obliterating it. The countries financially and logistically supporting Shaw’s agency were part of the old G8 vanguard and thus technically constituted the most “civilized” societies in the world. They could never employ brutal and sometimes lethal tactics through their own official channels. So they circumvented that problem by secretly creating and feeding a hybrid beast that was only graded on results achieved through any means possible. Typically, neither personal rights nor the benefit of legal counsel entered the equation.  
  
  Frank studied him for a moment. “I sent some flowers to Anna’s grave.”  
  
  Surprised, Shaw turned to him. “Why?”  
  
  “She was a fine woman. And for some reason she was head over heels for your sorry ass. That was the only flaw I could find in the lady, her poor judgment in men.”  
  
  Shaw turned to look back out the window.  
  
  “You’ll never find anybody that good ever again.”  
  
  “That’s why I’m not even bothering to look, Frank.”  
  
  “I was married once.”  
  
  Shaw closed the window and sat back. “What happened?”  
  
  “She’s not living anymore. She was sort of like Anna. I married way above my pay grade. That stuff never strikes twice.”  
  
  “At least you made it down the aisle. I never got that chance.”  
  
  Frank looked like he was going to say something else, but lapsed into silence. The two men rode the rest of the way to the airport without speaking.  
  
  CHAPTER  
  
  4  
  
  THE GULFSTREAM rode into the air on smooth winds. Once they’d leveled off, Frank brought out the usual file: photos, background reports, analyses, and action recommendations.  
  
  “Evan Waller,” began Frank. “Canadian. Sixty-three years old.”  
  
  Shaw picked up a cup of black coffee with one hand and a photo with the other. He was staring at a man whose head was shaved down to the scalp. He looked fit and strong and his facial features were sharp and angular, like an image on a high-def LCD screen with megahertz levels. Even from the photo the eyes seemed to house a current of electricity that looked capable of shooting straight out at Shaw, delivering a mortal wound. The man’s long nose appeared as though it started mid-forehead and ran arrow straight to the top of his mouth. It was a cruel mouth if there ever was such a thing, thought Shaw. And this man was no doubt cruel and evil and dangerous. If he weren’t all of those things, Shaw wouldn’t be looking at his photo. He never went after saints, only violent sinners.  
  
  “Looks good for his age,” said Shaw, dropping the photo onto the small table.  
  
  “For the last two decades at least he’s been into anything that makes lots of  
money. On the surface he’s golden. Legit businesses, keeps a low profile, gives to charities, is into helping third world countries build infrastructure.”  
  
  “But?”  
  
  “But we’ve discovered that his underlying wealth is built on human trafficking, mostly young Asian and African teens mass-kidnapped by Waller’s people and then sold into prostitution in the Western Hemisphere. That’s why he’s so into third world development. It’s his pipeline. He uses that as a way to get the product he needs. And his legit businesses launder the cash from those activities.”  
  
  “Okay, that qualifies him for a well-deserved visit from me.”  
  
  Frank stood and poured himself a Bloody Mary from the small bar set up against one wall of the aircraft and dropped a celery stalk in the glass. He sat back down, jiggling the ice with a long spoon. “Waller hid the details well. It took us time to get the goods on him, and even then it may not hold up in a court of law. The guy’s bad, no doubt about it, but proving it is another thing.”  
  
  “So why are we even bothering to go after him if we can’t put him away? That’ll just warn him off.”  
  
  Frank shook his head. “This is not a snatch-and-prosecute. It’s a snatch-and-rat. We take him and convince him it’s in his best interests to enlighten us about a new line of business for him that we just found out about.”  
  
  “Which is?”  
  
  “Nuclear materials trafficking with Islamic fundamentalists on the worldwide watch list. He rats them out, he gets a deal.”  
  
  “What kind of deal?”  
  
  “Basically he walks.”  
  
  “To keep enslaving young girls?”  
  
  “We’re talking avoiding nuclear holocaust here, Shaw. It’s a trade-off the higher-ups are willing to make. At least we’ll put his operation out of business for a while. But he gets his freedom and all the money he’s no doubt hidden around the world.”  
  
  “So he’ll just open for business again. You know, sometimes I get confused about which devil we’re actually dealing with.”  
  
  “We deal with them all, just in different ways.”  
  
  “Okay, so what’s the plan?”  
  
  “We found out that he’s heading to the south of France for a little holiday in between planning nuclear holocausts. He’s rented a villa in Gordes. You ever been there?” Shaw shook his head. “It’s really beautiful, so I hear.”  
  
  “So is Vienna, at least so I hear. All I usually get to see are the sewer pits, emergency rooms, and the morgue.”  
  
  “He travels with heavy security.”  
  
  “They always do. How do you see the extraction?”  
  
  “Quick and clean, of course. But the French are totally outside the loop on this. We can expect no help from them. If you go down, your ass is cooked.”  
  
  “Why would I expect anything less?”  
  
  “The timing will be tight.”  
  
  “The timing is always tight.”  
  
  “That’s true,” Frank conceded.  
  
  “So we kidnap him, work on him, and hope he breaks?”  
  
  “Our job is just to get him. Others will break him.”  
  
  “Right, and then let him walk?” Shaw said in disgust.  
  
  “The suits make the rules.”  
  
  “You’re wearing a suit.”  
  
  “Correction. The guys wearing the expensive suits make the rules.”  
  
  “Okay, but if you recall, the last time I was in France things didn’t go very well.”  
  
  Frank shrugged. “So let’s get down to the details.”  
  
  Shaw drained his coffee cup. “It’s all in the details, Frank. Plus a hell of a lot of luck.”  
  
  CHAPTER  
  
  5  
  
  REGGIE CAMPION drove her ten-year-old dented Smart Car City-Coupé from her flat in London past Leavesden to the north and continued on for a few more kilometers. After meandering through narrow country roads she turned off onto a one-car-wide dirt lane, eventually passing through lichen-covered stone columns that bore the name “Harrowsfield,” which was the property she was now on. Her gaze then carried, as it usually did, up the twisty crushed gravel drive toward the old crumbling mansion.  
  
  Some claimed Rudyard Kipling had once leased the estate. Reggie doubted that, although she believed it would have appealed to an author who had created such marvelous, intrigue-laden adventure stories. It was a vast place, jury-rigged in parts, with secret doors and passages, stone turrets with cold chambers, an enormous library, corridors that ended in solid walls, an attic filled with equal parts museum-quality artifacts and junk, a rabbit warren of a cellar with musty bottles of mostly undrinkable wine, an antiquated kitchen with a leaky roof and exposed, sparking wiring, and enough outbuildings to house several army battalions on over a hundred hectares of neglected grounds. It was ancient, falling apart, smelly, mostly uninhabitable, and she loved it. If she’d had the money she would have purchased it. But Reggie would never have enough money for that.  
  
  She often stayed overnight here. A hopeless insomniac, she would wander the dark mansion for hours. It was then that she thought she could feel the presence of others who also called Harrowsfield home though they were no longer among the living. She would have preferred to stay out here full-time. Her flat was small, basic, in an undesirable part of the city, and was still more than she could afford. She had cut back on luxuries such as food and clothing in order to get by. She had certainly not chosen this career path for the income potential.  
  
  She parked the car in front of the old carriage house now turned into garages and a workshop and saw that several people were there ahead of her. She used her key to open the door into the mudroom of the mansion and a little chime was heard. An instant later a broad-shouldered muscular man a little under six feet and in his thirties emerged from an inner room. He was holding a cup of tea in one hand and a customized nine-millimeter pistol in the other, and that was pointed at Reggie’s chest. He was dressed in tight-fitting, snake-hipped corduroy pants, a white button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and slim black leather loafers with no socks despite the damp chill that was normal for Harrowsfield even in the heat of summer. His fierce dark eyebrows nearly met in the middle of his forehead and his shaggy brown hair hung down to them.  
  
  On seeing her he slipped the gun in his shoulder holster, grinned, and took a sip of his tea. Whit Beckham said, “Eh, Reg, you shoulda rung up when you hit the gateposts. Almost shot you. Be in a funk for weeks if I did that.” His robust Irish accent had softened over the last few years to where Regina could understand almost all of what he said without the services of a translator.  
  
  She slipped off her jacket and hung it on a wooden peg on the wall. She was dressed in faded jeans, a burgundy lightweight turtleneck sweater with the collar turned up, and black ankle boots. Her hair was returned to its original shade of rich dark brown and was secured at the nape of her neck with a tortoiseshell clip. She wore no makeup, and as she stepped into the light thrown through the windows, one could see, though she was only twenty-eight, the beginnings of a fine web of lines around her wide, intense eyes.  
  
  “My mobile never manages to work round here, Whit.”  
  
  “I reckon it’s time to get a new mobile service then,” he advised. “Tea?”  
  
  “Coffee, the stronger the better. It was a long flight and I didn’t sleep much.”  
  
  “Coming up.”  
  
  “Brilliant, thanks. Dom here? Didn’t see his motorbike.”  
  
  “I think he parked it in one of the garages. And it’s not a motorbike.”  
  
  “What then?”  
  
  “It’s a crotch rocket. Has to do with horsepower and such, see?”  
  
  “Right, interesting stuff, male toys.”  
  
  He gave her a look. “You doing okay?”  
  
  She feigned a smile. “Smashing. Never better. You do it once, it gets easier each time.”  
  
  His face creased into a frown. “That’s a crock of shit and you know it.”  
  
  “Do I?”

  I sensed it was about to happen before I felt it. The entrance to the little cellar was small and cramped and there was no other way to manoeuvre out the next barrel without awkwardly bending over and yanking it out on its rim. I snapped my hand round my back to catch the offending fingers that seemed to think that pinching my backside was acceptable, but instead just succeeded in letting go of the beer keg and letting it drop heavily onto my protesting foot.  
  
  Shrieking suddenly in pain, I sprang backwards, colliding with my would-be attacker. He let out an exhaled ooph and staggered backwards whilst I spun around on one foot, trying to ignore the sharp throbbing hurt in my other one. I grabbed hold of his grubby shirt collar and shoved him against the wall. It was Derek, one of the regulars.  
  
  “What the fuck are you playing at?” I leaned closer to him and snatched his fingers with my right hand, squeezing them hard, and keeping hold of his shirt with my left.  
  
  He breathed out again, a cloudy breath of stale beer covering my face. I moved my face to the side in disgust and tightened my grip further.  
  
  “Jaysus, sweetheart, you need to chill out,” he gasped.  
  
  The heat inside me rose. Taking liberties with roving hands was one thing, but calling me sweetheart was something else entirely different. “Chill out? Chill the fuck out? Watch me chill you out, sweetheart. ” I let go of his hand and reached over to snatch the half-empty glass of ice and whiskey that he’d been clutching in his sweaty paw, scooping it up in one swift motion and then upturning it over his head. I dropped the glass dramatically on the floor and it shattered into several pieces. Derek wrenched away from both me and the wall, hands immediately running up to his head in an attempt to shake off the ice and droplets of booze from his face and hair.  
  
  He lashed out with one hand but I was faster than that and easily sprang out of his way, even within the confines of the small cellar.  
  
  “You fucking bitch. ”  
  
  I smiled, deciding I preferred that to sweetheart. Derek, meanwhile, turned back towards me, fist raised. I put my hands on my hips and raised my eyebrows, daring him on. This was going to be fun.  
  
  ‘What exactly is going on here?” A calm voice edged with steel interrupted my plans. Bugger.  
  
  “This arsehole,” I spat the word, “thinks that my body is fair game. I was merely abusing him of that notion. ” I turned to face Arnie, who was looking at me unhappily.  
  
  He threw a dishtowel at Derek and motioned to me to back off. “Oh come on, Arnie, it was him! I didn’t…”  
  
  “Enough. ” He gently pushed Derek outside back to the bar and shut the cellar door so that the two of us were alone. The offending keg offered little room but he kicked it away to the side and peered at me in the dim light. “You can’t do this, Jane. ”  
  
  “Can’t do what? Defend myself?” I was getting hotter by the second.  
  
  “Can’t assault our best customers,” he replied calmly.  
  
  “Assault? But he…” I tried to protest but Arnie just put a finger to his lips. Falling silent, I opted for glaring at him instead.  
  
  “You’re a barmaid. This is part of the job – it’s unsavoury, I know but you should have learnt how to deal with situations like this by now. And this is a job which, I’m afraid, you no longer hold. ”  
  
  I was momentarily dumbstruck. I hadn’t done anything – well, hardly anything anyway. I opened my mouth to speak but no words came out.  
  
  “I’m sorry, Jane. If you can’t keep your temper, then I can’t keep you. I’ll pay you till the end of the week but you need to go. Now. ”  
  
  The bottom suddenly dropped out of my world. Shit. I needed this job. Without proper identification and references, it had taken me ages to find someone who would take me on. And even then the best I could manage was this dive of a bar. I tried to backtrack. “Arnie, I’m sorry. I blew things out of proportion. I’ll apologise. I’ll even let him feel me up if that’ll help. You can’t do this, I need this work. ”  
  
  He shook his head at me sadly and stepped out of the cellar. I sat down on the upturned keg and massaged my swollen foot, trying not to let the prick of tears behind my throat get the better of me. I’d worked my arse off for that bastard – unsociable hours, basic minimum wage, no benefits other than the odd pack of pork scratchings. It wasn’t fair! I had the right to defend myself for fuck’s sake. I kicked angrily at the fallen keg and it thudded dully against the wall before rolling back and crunching over the broken shards of glass. Bending over, I turned it upright but caught my knuckle on one of the splinters. It pierced my skin and sent out a small shiver of pain. Bastards. Bastard Derek and bastard Arnie and bastard Anton and…I pulled out the glass fragment with my fingernails and watched a drop of iron rich blood ease its way from my hand and splash onto the floor. It was that stupid blood that had made me end up here in the sticks of Scotland in the first place. Bringing my knuckle to my mouth, I sucked the wound and allowed the heat inside me momentarily take over, blanking out my more rational thoughts.  
  
  After a minute or two, I sniffed and squared my shoulders. Worse things happened at sea. If I could get through John’s death, get through being thrown out of my home by a homicidal werebear, get through living in close quarters with the very shifty and very scary head of the Brethren, then I could get through losing a lousy job like this. I pulled the pieces of my shattered pride back together and steeled myself to face the music.  
  
  Standing up, I limped through the cellar door. Derek was looking at me triumphantly, with a sneer all over his ugly pock-marked face. I threw him the nastiest look I could, feeling some remote satisfaction at the fact that he was still dabbing at his neck with the dishtowel. The other bar patrons were staring at me in a hushed silence, but looked away awkwardly when I turned to them challengingly. Without warning, the jukebox’s random music selection kicked in with the entirely inappropriate notes of Shania Twain’s Man I Feel Like A Woman. I tried to avoid rolling my eyes. Arnie wordlessly handed me over a brown envelope and raised his eyebrows so, sighing heavily and over-dramatically at the injustice of the world, I reached down behind the bar to grab my bag. Then I left.  
  
  My brief wave of bravado deserted me when I got outside and felt the cold night air wash over me. I really didn’t know what I was going to do now. Trudging back to my little bedsit, I mulled over the possibilities. I could stay here, in Inverness, and try my luck at getting work in some of the few places I’d not already tried. The nearest pack was over in Aberdeen and, whilst I didn’t have a large enough ego to imagine that every shifter in the country was doing nothing other than trying to find one supposed little rogue, I wanted to keep as far away from them all as possible. But that meant that my options were fairly limited in terms of where I could go. Thrusting my hands in my pockets to stave off the cold, I hunched my shoulders. I searched inside myself to find a spark of fire that I could warm my own insides with, but there was nothing there. Fat lot of good all this dragon blood was if it was always going to be completely uncontrollable and never there when I needed it.  
  
  I stopped to cross over at a set of traffic lights and realised that gazing steadily at me from the gloom of the other side of the road was a dark shape. I stiffened immediately, tensing. Whoever it was, they were wearing an old-fashioned trilby and overcoat, but their features were hidden in the shadows. I wasn’t in the mood for any fun and games. Squaring my shoulders, I stepped off the kerb to confront them, and almost got run over by a huge lorry thundering through and driving too fast through the quiet street. The driver slammed on his horn making me jump almost completely out of my skin. I gestured rudely after him and looked back at the shadowy figure. However, in the time the lorry had taken to pass me by, the other pavement had become comp  
letely deserted again. A wave of uneasiness ran through me and I hurried home.  
  
  Back in the relative comfort of my little room, I sat heavily down on my bed cum sofa and rubbed my eyes. This was not good. The morning paper lay unread on the table so I picked it up and flicked through to the classified section. There were scant few jobs being advertised. I ran my finger down the column. An office junior post – paperwork, yuck; a cleaner’s position at one of the big chain hotels – they’d demand background details that I couldn’t provide; a couple of labouring positions and very little else. I’d have to hit the streets tomorrow and try to cold call the local businesses to see if I could drum anything up. I leaned over to the small kettle and flicked it on to brew a cup of strong coffee, then reached for the battered laptop that had cost me far more than I could afford. Turning it on and heading straight to the Othernet, I cursed myself for my weakness.  
  
  When I’d been part of the pack, I’d hardly ever had cause to bother with the Othernet, the supernatural world’s equivalent of the internet, but now that I was an outcast I found it hard to keep away. I found myself scouring its sites daily, checking that everything was safe in Cornwall, hoping for some news somewhere that would tell me how Tom and Betsy were getting on now that they had joined the ranks of the Brethren. And, on occasion, looking for gossip about Corrigan. I told myself that it was just self-preservation. He’d sworn that he would find me in his last Voice communication so it was important that I kept track of where he was. Just in case he was in the area and I had to run away and hide of course. I browsed around for a while but there was nothing new to be found. The Ministry of Mages were hunkered down trying to deal with the waves of applications that they were receiving now that they had opened up their recruitment procedures again and apparently there was some trouble over in Wales with some sprites hustling sheep. Nothing about the Brethren, other than an old photo of some of them at some kind of shifter ball that I’d already seen a dozen times. Corrigan was there, wearing a tuxedo that almost seemed to be sprayed onto his muscular frame, with some shapely brunette hanging off his arm and Staines was typically lurking in the background. There was no sign of either Tom or Betsy.  
  
  I resisted the urge to click on the link for the Pack’s own website. The last time I’d done that there had been a photo of myself staring back and a caption asking that if anyone saw me they were to call the London number with information. It hadn’t even been a terribly good photo; in fact it had been taken in the great hall after John and I had felled a particularly nasty spriggan that had taken to attempting to steal away a couple of local children. It had been a long chase and I was hardly looking coiffed and groomed. The photo itself had been cropped to leave off John but if you looked closely you could see his hand loosely wrapped my shoulder. That was just painful to look at.   Irritated with myself for still caring about the pack in the first place, I closed the laptop with a thump and lay down with the coffee by the side of the bed. I may not have always enjoyed the restrictions that came with being a member of the pack, and may have often craved more independence, but now I just felt lonely. They’d been my family; I’d have died to keep them safe and I knew that most of them at least would have done the same for me. And now I had no-one.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  The next day dawn broke early. I’d had a restless night, tossing and turning, worried about what I was going to do next. I’d decided, around 3am, that I’d give myself two days to find work here in Inverness and then if nothing turned up I’d head elsewhere. Maybe I could travel to a bigger city like Birmingham and lose myself in the anonymity of life there. There would be a pack for sure, but I was confident I could keep out of their way in the masses of humanity. If there were more people then there would be more jobs. I might even be able to make a few friends and put down some semi-permanent roots. This nomadic lifestyle that I’d been leading so far was starting to grate on me.  
  
  After a freezing cold shower in the communal bathroom, I pulled on the smartest clothes I could find and hit the streets. Without a National Insurance number, the Job Centre was out but I might always be able to find some small adverts looking for help in a few of the newsagents’ windows. Deciding to venture to the busy Victorian Arcade first to try the little tourist shops there, I set out with a renewed confidence and vigour in my step.  
  
  The first few places I tried were polite but firm. It was out of season and they had no need for anyone else, especially someone just wandering in off the streets. Trying to keep my spirits high – no-one would employ a grumpy cow after all - I moved onto the book shop, named Clava Books.  
  
  Unlike the other stores on the arcade, Clava Books was dingy and looking as if it had seen better days. A bell on the door jangled as I went in. A muffled voice called out from the back that they’d be with me in a minute so I took a moment to browse the little shop’s offerings. Dotted around the uneven wooden floor were piles of books placed haphazardly around. I almost caught one leaning edifice with the corner of my foot and just managed to pull back in time before the whole thing went toppling to the ground. It didn’t appear to be the most organised shop in the whole world and I wondered idly if there was much business to be had at all in the arena of old books that had seen better days.  
  
  There were numerous Gaelic tomes on the shelves, some incredibly dusty, as well as a sprinkling of the usual coffee table photo books of the highlands of Scotland. I picked one up and flicked through, stopping at the pages of Clava Cairns, a 4000 year old group of burial cairns. No doubt this was the bookshop’s namesake. Kind of creepy, if you asked me, to name a shop after a cemetery. Admittedly there was a rather beautiful full page photo that had been taken at night, with several people holding flames aloft and staring towards the back of a group of higgledy-piggledy stones. Druids perform the Winter Solstice welcoming ceremony read the caption underneath. On reading that, the vestiges of a thought flickered at the back of my mind. Before I could fully form the words, however, my musings were interrupted by a series of clatters and thuds from towards the back of the shop.  
  
  Eventually an older woman with graying hair tied up in a neat bun, emerged from a dark wooden door. “Aha!” she said, with warmth in her voice. “So you’re interested in the Cairns, are you?”  
  
  I gently closed the book and placed it back on the shelf. “Of course,” I murmured. It was important to appear as if everything about this shop was fascinating if I wanted to get a job here.  
  
  I clearly didn’t do a very good job of looking interested, however, because she gazed at me with somewhat of a skeptical expression on her face. “Have you been to visit the Cairns yourself?”  
  
  “Erm, no,” I admitted. “But they are high on my to do list,” I quickly added with a hopeful smile.  
  
  “So it’s work you’re after, is it?”  
  
  I started. How had she known that?  
  
  “It’s written all over your face, dearie. Sorry, you don’t like being called dearie, do you?”  
  
  Okay, now I was getting freaked out. Were my thoughts really that transparent?  
  
  The old lady smiled benignly and patted my hand. “I’m Mrs Alcoon,” she said, warmly.  
  
  I couldn’t help smiling back despite her formality. “Er…I’m Jane. Jane Smith. ” I’d kept my surname since moving to Inverness; Smith was obviously a common enough name to arouse absolutely zero suspicion. Using Mackenzie as well would have just been inviting trouble, however, so I stuck with the plain moniker I’d given myself when I’d found work at Arnie’s pub.  
  
  Mrs Alcoon raised her white eyebrows briefly before murmuring, “Really? Jane? Funny, you don’t look like a Jane. ”  
  
  I coughed slightly then cleared my throat, stirring myself to at least appear confident even if I was more than slightly alarmed by the elderly woman’s prescience. “What can I say? My parents just lacked some imagination. ” It occurred to me that if my name really was Jane, I’d be feeling rather insulted by myself right about now.  
  
  Mrs Alcoon raised a shoulder in a brief shrug as if to dismiss the matter. “Well, Jane, you’ve arrived just in time. As it turns out, I do need some help. Not full-time, you understand, but a little helping hand here and there would definitely be welcome. Perhaps a few mornings a week? Cleaning the shop, attending to the customers, running a few errands?”  
  
  This was going considerably better than I’d expected. “I…um…yes. ” I cleared my throat again. “Yes, please. ”  
  
  She smiled at me again. “Then let’s brew a pot and have a cuppa and discuss your renumeration. ”  
  
  She led me off into a small kitchen off the side of the main shop area. The tiles were cracked with dirty grouting lining their uneven finish but there was a little fridge, a few cupboards and a kettle and toaster. I supposed you didn’t need much else to get by. There was also a little table with two wooden chairs against it in the middle of the small room so I took one and sat down. I was still feeling rather shocked that this was going so well and I half expected old Mrs Alcoon to suddenly burst out laughing and tell me that she’d just been playing a joke on me. To her credit, however, she busied herself with flicking on the kettle and pulling out a couple of chipped mugs and a teapot, humming away to herself tunelessly. Turning her back to me, she started pulling things out of the cupboards and getting herself organised.  
  
  Once the kettle had boiled, she filled the little teapot and brought it over, along with some surprisingly tasty oat biscuits. The proferred pot unfortunately wasn’t coffee but instead some kind of potent herbal tea that made my eyes water and my tongue sting. I swallowed it down, however, to be polite; Julia had taught me well. It turned out that Mrs Alcoon had been considering taking someone else on for a while, to help keep the shop running. I did wonder if she was actually making any money at all, given the lack of customers that had so far ventured across the threshold but I wanted to work here, not to point out the lack of business that I’d so far seen so I refrained from voicing my question out loud. She needed someone to come in four mornings a week and help out, and I promised that I would help “spruce the place up a bit as well,” as she put it. We agreed upon the princely sum of one hundred and twenty pounds a week – which was actually not much less than Arnie had been paying me at the pub and would definitely cover my main costs, even it meant I’d be continuing to scrimp and scrape – and she set me to work straight away cleaning down the shelves.  
  
  The rest of the morning passed quickly. Although no would-be customers entered the little shop’s doors, there was plenty to keep me occupied. In fact, it was fairly satisfying work. The dust was thick in many of the little nooks and crannies and the many tomes, often as old and dusty as the building itself appeared, regularly caught my interest. The lack of passing trade met my first impressions, however. Clava Books was  
n’t exactly full of the glossy bestsellers that would tempt most people to venture inside. Mrs Alcoon, for her turn, disappeared into another little room at the back from where I occasionally heard the odd clank and thud of things being dropped or moved around. The peace – and immediate trust that she’d placed in me – was reassuring.  
  
  By 2pm I’d managed to clear the worst of the dust away, leaving just a few motes dancing around in the weak winter sunshine.  
  
  “Goodness, you’ve done a grand job,” she exclaimed, emerging from the door at the back of the shop. “I’ll have to find you more things to do next time. ”  
  
  I felt a brief wash of worry that the old lady didn’t need me in the slightest and had just hired me out of pity. Then I wondered whether I could afford to be bothered by that and if I should just accept the charity that was being offered.  
  
  It’s perfect, however,” she continued, “ as I need to run out tomorrow morning and pick up some supplies. This way you can stay and keep the shop open – otherwise I’d have to shut it up. ” She smiled without a hint of self-deprecation at all. “And that wouldn’t be good for business. ”  
  
  Was she reading my mind again and soothing my worry that I was nothing more than a charity case or was all this just coincidence? I smiled halfheartedly back at her, feeling a nervous flicker of bloodfire in the pit of my belly.  
  
  “So where do you come from, Jane?” she enquired with the air of someone who was barely interested.  
  
  I stiffened further. Why did she need to know that? I tried not to let my thoughts show on my face. “Oh, I’ve lived all over,” I said airily. At least I hoped it was airily and not with the growl that I really wanted to answer with.  
  
  “Ah, a wandering traveller! Part of me wondered whether that brilliant red hair of yours suggested a Scottish heritage. Your accent doesn’t fit with this little corner of the world, however. ”  
  
  I smiled weakly again and watched as she picked up a few sheaves of paper and peered at them over her glasses before rearranging them slightly and then placing then back down in a messy pile on the shop counter. Her hands gave away her age, with papery white skin covering the visible blue lines of her veins within. Taking her in a fight shouldn’t be a problem, although I knew well that appearances could be deceptive.

I'm a 19-year-old guy, and I've been on sertraline about four or five years. My dose has been stable at 125mg for over a year now, and it's been working fine. However in the last few months I've noticed that I'm suddenly super sensitive to heat. I get these hot flashes multiple times a day and just sweat like crazy, even when I'm just sitting around. It's so uncomfortable and makes me feel gross, and I'm having to take a lot more showers just to feel clean.

I know sweating can be a side effect of sertraline, but why would it just start now after all these years? It doesn't make sense. I haven't changed my diet or exercise, and the dose has been the same. I used to take sumatriptan for migraines, but I stopped a couple of months ago because I was worried I was getting serotonin syndrome. The heat sensitivity seems to have started after that anyways so I don't think it's related? I drink 1-2 cups of coffee a day, which hasn't changed either. 

I'm going to see my doctor soon, but I wanted to see if anyone here has gone through something similar. Could this be a delayed side effect from the sertraline? ",1,1756065149.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False
1mz5l9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1mz5l9d/should_you_trust_the_best_travel_electric_kettle/,Should You Trust the Best Travel Electric Kettle Elite Gourmet,"The Elite Gourmet EKT719 electric kettle quickly became my go-to gadget for boiling water after I decided to put it through its paces. Small but mighty, it fit snugly into my overloaded kitchen counter that barely has room for another appliance. This kettle's unique features and compact design had me intrigued, and as someone who regularly needs hot water for tea, instant noodles, or even baby formula, it promised to be a versatile fit.

**Practical and Compact Design**

The kettle’s compact size is a blessing for anyone who doesn’t have much space to spare. Its minimalistic build helps it easily squeeze into cramped kitchen corners, small dorm rooms, or even an RV cupboard. I appreciated the retractable handle, which folded neatly for storage purposes. This feature especially stood out when I packed it inside my overstuffed suitcase for a weekend getaway. Weighing only 1.7 pounds, carrying it around was hassle-free. Plus, the cool-touch matte exterior, paired with the brushed finish, feels as good as it looks, offering a minimalist yet sophisticated vibe suitable for modern spaces.

**Easy-to-Operate Features**

Operating this portable electric kettle couldn’t be simpler. A one-touch button activates boiling, accompanied by a trusty LED indicator that lets you know when the kettle is powered on. Auto shut-off and boil-dry protection helped me feel at ease whenever I walked away while it was running. The last thing I want is a kitchen mishap, and both of these safety features made it worry-free to use even in busy moments. There's a clear sense of thoughtfulness behind the design, which really shines through here.

**Pros**

- Compact and lightweight, ideal for travel, RVs, and small kitchens
- Well-thought-out safety features like auto shut-off and boil-dry protection
- Stunning design with a cool-touch exterior and retractable handle
- Easy-to-use one-touch boiling with LED notification
- Dual voltage makes it functional across different regions and power setups

**Performance and Versatility**

If performance is what you’re after, this kettle delivers reliable results efficiently. With a capacity of 0.6 liters (about 20 ounces), it's perfect for brewing enough water for a couple of cups of tea or coffee. The concealed heating system worked like a charm, boiling water in under three minutes. I timed a batch, and it truly is one of the fastest small-scale kettles I’ve tested. Its stainless-steel interior ensured no plasticky aftertaste in the water, something I always find with subpar kettles.

What impressed me the most was its versatility. Whether it’s coffee, oatmeal, or even preparing baby formula on the go, it handled all my daily hot-water requirements without breaking a sweat.

**Negatives**

- Limited capacity may not suffice for those who require larger quantities of hot water
- Some external coating materials can attract fingerprints over time
- A slightly longer cord would provide better flexibility during use

**Safety and Durability**

One of the key highlights of this gadget is its stainless-steel interior combined with its double-wall insulation. While the water inside remained warm much longer than I expected, the exterior stayed cool enough to touch throughout. Forget worrying about accidental burns or scalding. The materials also give it a durable feel that seems built for repeated daily use. Even the hinged pop-up lid clicked open effortlessly, making refilling and cleaning straightforward.

**Features for Travelers**

Dual voltage support is another standout function, and it is incredible for anyone on the move. Switching between 120VAC and 220-240VAC using the little toggle underneath the kettle was simple. This was a lifesaver on my recent international trip where the voltage standards differed drastically. Its suitability for travel, RV living, or even a quiet coffee in a dorm room cannot be understated.

**Competing Products**

Admittedly, I did a fair bit of research before testing the Elite Gourmet EKT719. Competing products like the Hamilton Beach Travel Kettle or the Amazon Basics 1.0L kettle each offer certain pros, but they fall short in certain categories. While both competitors offer larger capacities, they lack in ease of portability and safe-to-touch exteriors. The collapsible handle on this product, for instance, left the Hamilton Beach kettle seeming rather bulkier in comparison. On the flip side, if brewing water for multiple servings in one go is non-negotiable, alternatives like the Gooseneck Electric Kettle might prove better suited.

**True Value**

Despite its modest size, this electric kettle packs a punch when it comes to value. Its versatility and unique features, coupled with its competitive best-sellers' ranking, point toward its overall quality. I found myself using it not just for its intended purpose but also in creative ways—like making instant noodles or reheating soup while on the go. Compared to pricier models with only marginally better functionality, it hits an ideal intersection of form and price efficiency.

I'm 33. History of Endometriosis (stage 3), Adenomyosis and PCOS. Currently on the waiting list for a hysterectomy. I'm very overweight but otherwise healthy. 

6 weeks ago I woke with chest pains, difficulty swallowing and feeling like there was something stuck in my throat. I went to A and E, ECG was normal, Troponin was 35. I was sent home. The next day my symptoms got worse. ECG again was normal, Troponin was 34. But I started vomiting. I was sent home with Omeprazole, Painkillers and Anti-Sickness and a referral to Gastro. 

Gastro ordered an Endoscopy with Biopsies. Nodules were found in my throat and they have been sent off to pathology. So currently waiting for the results. Expected in the next 3-4 weeks.

From the day it started to today (6 weeks) I've lost 32 pounds. I'm still unable to eat. I'm surving on water, coffee and occasional bits of bread. Anything else I try I vomit almost immediately. I can't keep any meds down so no anti-sickness. Meal replacements shakes also cause vomiting. 

My Doctor is not very helpful, he keeps saying to wait for results of the Biopsies. When I asked for help with eating (I feel terrible, tired all the time, grouchy, my skin is breaking out etc, I have zero energy) he told me that because I'm overweight that loosing weight is a positive. That I'm too big to need help and that that is reserved for smaller people with eating difficulties. 

Any ideas what could be going on? Or what I could try that may help? Is there something specific/certain test I should be asking my GP to do?

  Tom Langdon was a journalist, a globetrotting one, because it was in his blood to roam widely. Where others saw only instability and fear in life, Tom felt graced by an embracing independence. He’d spent the bulk of his career in foreign lands covering wars, insurrections, famines, pestilence, virtually every earthly despair. His goal had been relatively simple: He had wanted to change the world by calling attention to its wrongs. And he did love adventure.  
  
  However, after chronicling all these horrific events and still seeing the conditions of humanity steadily worsen, he’d returned to America filled with disappointment. Seeking an antidote to his melancholy he’d started writing drearily light stories for ladies’ magazines, home-decorating journals, garden digests, and the like. However, after memorializing the wonders of compost and the miracle that was do-it-yourself wood flooring, he wasn’t exactly fulfilled.  
  
  It was nearing Christmas, and Tom’s most pressing dilemma was getting from the East Coast to Los Angeles for the holidays. He had an age-old motivation for the journey; in LA was his girlfriend, Lelia Gibson. She’d started out as a movie actress, but after years of appearing in third-rate horror films she’d begun doing voiceover work. Now, instead of being cinematically butchered for her daily bread, she supplied the character voices for a variety of enormously popular Saturday-morning cartoons. In the children’s television industry it was accepted that no one belted out the voices of goofy woodland creatures with greater flair and versatility than golden-piped Lelia Gibson. As proof, she had a shelf full of awards, an outrageously large income, and a healthy share of syndication rights.  
  
  Tom and Lelia had hit it off on an overnight flight from Southeast Asia to the States. At first he thought it might have been all the liquor they drank, but when that buzz burned off a couple hours out of LA, she was still beautiful and interesting — if a little ditzy and eccentric — and she still seemed attracted to him. He stayed over in California and they got to know each other even better. She visited him on the East Coast, and they’d been a comfortable if informal bi-coastal item ever since.  
  
  It might seem strange that a successful Hollywood lady would go for a nomadic gent who ran through passports like water, could spout off funny if lewd phrases in thirty languages, and never would be financially secure. Yet Lelia had tired of the men in her circle. As she diplomatically explained it once, they were complete and total lying scum and unreliable to boot. Tom was a newsman, she said, so at least he occasionally dealt with the truth. She also loved his rugged good looks. He took that to mean the deep lines etched on his face from reporting in windswept desert climates with bullets flying. In fact his face was more often than not down in the sand in observance of local safety regulations.  
  
  She listened with rapt attention to Tom’s tales of covering major stories around the globe. For his part, he observed with admiration the professional way Lelia went about her loony-voice career. And they didn’t have to live together year-round — a decided advantage, Tom believed, over the complex hurdles facing couples who actually cohabitated.  
  
  He’d been briefly married but had never had kids. Today his exwife wouldn’t accept a collect call from him if he were hemorrhaging to death on the street. He was forty-one and had just lost his mother to a stroke; his father had been dead for several years. Being an only child, he was truly alone now, and that had made him introspective. Half his time on earth was gone, and all he had to show for it was a failed marriage, no offspring, an informal alliance with a California voiceover queen, a truckload of newsprint, and some awards. By any reasonable measure, it was a miserable excuse for an existence.  
  
  He’d had an opportunity for a wonderful life with another woman but the relationship had, inexplicably, fallen apart. He now fully understood that not marrying Eleanor Carter would forever stand as the major mistake of his life. Yet, ever the man of action, and wanderlust upon him once more, Tom was taking the train to LA for Christmas.  
  
  Why the train, one might ask, when there were perfectly good flights that would get him there in a fraction of the time? Well, a guy can only take so many of those airport security search wands venturing into sacrosanct places, or requests to drop trousers in front of strangers, or ransacking of carry-on bags, before blowing a big one. The fact was, he’d blown a big one at La Guardia Airport. Not merely a nuclear meltdown, his detonation resembled something closer to the utter destruction of Pompeii.  
  
  He’d just flown in from Italy after researching yet another bit of fluff, this time on wine-making, and imbibing more of the subject matter than he probably should have to get through the ordeal of crash-learning soil diversification and vine rot. As a result, he was tired, cranky, and hung over. He’d slept for three hours at a friend’s apartment in New York before heading to the airport to catch a flight to Texas. He’d been given an assignment to write about teen beauty pageants there, which he’d accepted because he enjoyed blood sports as much as the next person.  
  
  At the security gate at La Guardia, the search wand had smacked delicate things of Tom’s person that it really had no business engaging, socially or otherwise. Meanwhile, another security person managed to dump every single thing from Tom’s bag onto the conveyor belt. He watched helplessly as very personal possessions rolled by in front of suddenly interested strangers.  
  
  To put a fine finish on this very special moment, he was then informed that a major warning flag had been raised regarding his ID, his hair color, his clothing choice, or the size of his nose. (They were never really clear on that actually.) Thus, instead of flying to Dallas he’d be enjoying the company of a host of FBI, DEA, CIA, and NYPD personnel for an unspecified period of time. The phrase “five-to-ten” was even bandied about. Well, that, coupled with his exploited physical parts, was his absolute limit. So, the lava poured forth.  
  
  Langdon was six-feet-two and carried about 220 pounds of fairly hard muscle, and real honest-to-God steam was coming out his ears. His eruption involved language he ordinarily wouldn’t use within four miles of any church as he launched himself at the security team, grabbed their infamous search wand, and snapped it right in half. He wasn’t proud of his violent act that day, although the rousing cheers from some of the other passengers who had heard and seen what had happened to him did manage to lift his spirits a bit.  
  
  Thankfully, the magistrate Tom appeared before had recently endured airport security of an extremely overzealous nature, and when he gave his testimony, she and Tom shared a knowing look. Also, the red flag raised at the security gate had been, shockingly, a mistake. Thus Tom only received a stern warning, with instructions to enroll in anger-management classes, which he planned to do as soon as his uncontrollable urge to maim the fellow with the search wand subsided. However, the other consequence of the blowup was that he’d been banned from placing his miserable person on any air carrier that flew within the continental United States for the next two years. He hadn’t thought they could do that, but then he was shown the appropriate statutory power in the microscopic print of the airline’s legal manifesto under the equally tiny section titled “Lost Luggage Liability Limit — Five Dollars.”  
  
  And that’s when he had his epiphany. Being unable to fly, his usual and necessary way of traveling, was an omen; it had to be a sign of something divine, something important. Thus he was going to take the train to LA. He was going to write a story about it, traveling by rail from sea to shining sea during the Christmas season. He had a grand motivation, beyond spending the holiday with Lelia. Tom Langdon was one of the Elmira, New York, Langdons. To those with a keen knowledge of literary history, the Elmira Langdons brought to mind Olivia Langdon. Olivia, besides having bee  
n a lovely, resilient, if ultimately tragic person in her own right, gained lasting fame by marrying the loquacious orator, irascible personality, and prolific scribe known to his friends as Samuel Clemens, but otherwise known to the world and to history as Mark Twain.  
  
  Tom had known of this familial connection since he was old enough to block-letter his name. It had always inspired him to earn his living with words. For Twain had also been a journalist, starting at the Territorial Enterprise in Virginia City, Nevada, before going on to fame, fortune, bankruptcy, and then fame and fortune again.  
  
  Tom, for his part, had been imprisoned twice by terrorist groups and very nearly killed half a dozen times covering a variety of wars, skirmishes, coups, and revolutions that “civilized” societies used to settle their differences. He’d seen hope replaced with terror, terror replaced with anger, anger replaced with — well, nothing, for the anger always seemed to stick around and make trouble for everybody.  
  
  Though he’d won major awards, he believed he wasn’t a writer with the ability to create memorable prose that would stand tall and strong over the eons. Not like Mark Twain. Yet to have even a marginal connection to the creator of Huckleberry Finn, Life on the Mississippi, and The Man Who Corrupted Hadleyburg, a man whose work was timeless, made Tom feel wonderfully, if vicariously, special.  
  
  Shortly before he died, Tom’s father had asked his son to finish something that, according to legend, Twain never had. As his father told it, Mark Twain, who probably traveled more than any man of his time, had taken a transcontinental railroad trip over the Christmas season during the latter part of his life, his so-called dark years. Apparently he’d wanted to see some good in the world amid all the tragedy he and his family had suffered. He’d supposedly taken extensive notes about the trip but for some reason had never distilled them into a story. That’s what Tom’s father had asked him to do: take the train ride, write the story, finish what Twain never had, and do the Langdon side of the family proud.  
  
  At the time Tom had just finished a frantic twenty-hour plane odyssey from overseas to see his dad before he passed. When Tom heard his mumbled request, he was struck dumb. Travel across the country on a train during Christmas, to finish something Mark Twain allegedly hadn’t? He had thought his father delirious with his final suffering, and so his dad’s wish went unfulfilled. Yet now, because he could no longer fly in the Lower Forty-eight unless he was fingerprinted and shackled, he was finally going to take that trip for his old man, and maybe for himself too.  
  
  Over almost three thousand miles of America, he was going to see if he could find himself. He was doing it during the Christmas season because that was supposed to be a time of renewal and, for him perhaps, a last chance to clean up whatever mess he’d made of himself. At least he was going to try.  
  
  However, had he known what life-altering event would happen to him barely two hours after he boarded the train, he might have opted to walk to California instead.  
  
  the capitol limited  
  
  Washington, D.C., to Chicago  
  
  chapter two  
  
  As he got out of the cab in front of Union Station in Washington, D.C., where his train trip would begin, Tom reflected on the few rail journeys he’d taken in the United States. They’d all been along the Northeast Corridor — the routes between D.C., New York, and Boston — on the newest Amtrak equipment, the Acela high-speed trains. Fast, beautiful, and spacious, these trains were easily in the class of their European cousins. They had cool glass doors between train cars that slid open when one approached, reminding Tom of the portal on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise. Indeed, the first time Tom was on the Acela and those doors slid open he started looking around for a Vulcan in a Starfleet dress uniform.  
  
  Tom had reservations in a sleeping-car compartment on the Capitol Limited train that would carry him from D.C. to Chicago. He actually had to take two trains to get to the West Coast. The Capitol Limited constituted the first leg, and the venerable Southwest Chief would handle the second and much longer jaunt. The Capitol Limited had a storied history, being part of the fabled Baltimore and Ohio line. The B&O was the first common-carrier train company in the United States, and it also held the distinction of being the first to actually haul people.  
  
  The “Cap,” as the Limited was affectionately known, was always considered the most stylish and sophisticated long-distance train in the country. It had once boasted lobster Newburg on the menu and china and real glass in the dining room, and fancy domed train cars out of which to see the countryside roll by. It also had Pullman cars with legendary Pullman car attendants who made, it was said, tips of enormous proportion. In its long history the Cap had carried kings and princes and presidents and movie stars and titans of industry from Chicago to D.C. and back again, and the stories that poured forth from these trips constituted a legendary part of railroad lore. Tom could have had a lucrative career as a society reporter simply covering the ribald antics of train passengers on that route.  
  
  In his youth, because of the family connection and his father’s great interest in the man, Tom had immersed himself in Mark Twain’s life, work, and wit. In preparation for his transcontinental trip, he’d reread The Innocents Abroad, Twain’s account of a five-month journey on the steamship Quaker City to Europe and the Holy Land. He thought it one of the funniest, most irreverent travel books ever written. If one could imagine Sam Clemens — then a rawboned man fresh from the Wild West, very removed from the world-famous, sophisticated man of letters he’d become — in the company of a boatload of pious Midwesterners on their first sojourn to the Old World, the outrageous possibilities became readily apparent. Tom wasn’t going abroad, but in many ways he felt like a pilgrim traveler in his own country, because, ironically, he’d seen far more of the rest of the world than he had of America.  
  
  The Capitol Limited left D.C. at precisely 4:05 P.M., made twelve stops between Washington, D.C., and Chicago, and arrived the following morning in the Windy City punctually at 9:19 A.M. Tom had a layover in Chicago until that afternoon where he’d board the Southwest Chief and sail on to LA. It was a good plan and it got his juices going in a way that articles detailing the best times to prune one’s holly trees or pump out one’s septic tank never had.  
  
  He picked up his tickets, checked his ski equipment with the baggage agent — Lelia and he were going to the elegantly chic slopes of Tahoe for Christmas — and observed the grandeur of Union Station, which, before it was revitalized, came very close to falling victim to the wrecking ball. In the late 1960s it had become the National Visitors Center — basically a broken slide show in a big hole that no one ever visited. After that $30 million misfire, the National Visitors Center with no visitors was quietly closed except for one tiny and leaky part of the building where one could, of all things, actually board a train.  
  
  Tom’s father, returning from the Second World War in 1945, had come through this Romanesque-style train terminal on his way home. As Tom walked through the lavishly sculpted and adorned marble halls, he imagined himself retracing his father’s optimistic steps back to the safety of civilian life after helping to save the world from tyranny with nothing more than a gun and a young man’s courage. It seemed fitting that Tom should start his journey here since his father had ended one life and begun another through this portal. The son could only hope to do as much.  
  
  Tom took a few minutes to look at the enormous model Christmas train set up in the main hall’s West End. The area was packed with children and adults doubtless intrigued by the miniature metal creations racing through elaborately built town and country sets. Trains had a nostalgic magnetism that was undeniable, even for the many Americans who’d never even been on one. In this spirit, Tom found himself smiling broadly as the little cars whizzed by on the tiny tracks.  
  
  The train would be boarding shortly, so he headed to the departure area. Even though some train stations had recently implemented baggage screening, a person could still literally arrive at the last minute and make their ride. There were no security ch  
eckpoints, no nosy wands, no inane questions about whether you’d let a complete stranger load a small thermonuclear device in your carry-on bag while you were in the men’s room, as though you wouldn’t have volunteered such information on your own. You just jumped on and went. In the modern world of endless rules, the simplicity of it all was actually very refreshing.  
  
  Tom sat down in the Cap waiting area and began studying his fellow passengers. When he had ridden the Acela to New York, virtually all the waiting passengers had been businesspeople, dressed sharply and outfitted with all sorts of corporate weapons: cell phones, Black-berries, Palm Pilots, laptops, ear receivers, laser-guided power pointers, plutonium-charged thingamajigs and hard-drive ready-to-wear. These were people with a mission, raring to go, and when that door opened to let the masses board, they boarded with a vengeance. Tom nearly had all his clothes stripped off because he didn’t step fast enough. One tiny but determined CEO bore down on him like he was holding a little red cape, her sole purpose in life being to expose his entrails to the open air.  
  
  The group waiting for the Cap was more varied. There were whites and African Americans and Native Americans, Muslims dressed in traditional garb, Asian Americans — a nice sampling of ethnicity and origins, pretty equally split between men and women.  
  
  An attractive young couple sitting next to Tom were sipping Diet Cokes and holding hands, looking very nervous. Perhaps this was their first time away from home. Tom had traveled so much at such a young age that he could relate to the anxiety they might be feeling. Next to them was an elderly man of the cloth taking a little siesta, his feet up on his duffel.  
  
  Sitting across from the priest was a slender woman with very angular features, a geometric project honed from skin and bone. Tom couldn’t really tell her age because she was wearing a long, multicolored scarf around her head, almost like a turban. She also wore wooden shoes the size of thirty-pound dumbbells. Spread on the chair next to her were Tarot cards, which she was studiously poring over. When anyone passed she’d glance up with a look that seemed to say “I know all about you.” It was a little unnerving, actually. Tom had had his palm read by an old fellow in the Virgin Islands once. He’d promised Tom a long life filled with a passel of kids, a loving wife, and nothing but good times. Tom had often thought about hunting the liar down and getting his money back.  
  
  He watched one elderly lady maneuvering around on a walker. She reminded him of his mother. After her stroke she couldn’t speak, so he’d concocted a little system. He’d lay a photo of her and himself when he was a boy on his mother’s chest and she’d pick it up with her good hand. That meant things were okay, that she was still there. He’d never forget the time he laid the photo down and waited eight hours for her to pick it up. She never did. She died the next day.  
  
  A few minutes later Tom and the other passengers all grabbed their bags and headed out. The mighty Capitol Limited was calling his name.  
  
  chapter three  
  
  Outside, the air was very cold, the fat clouds holding the promise of snow or at least sleet. In such weather airplane passengers worried about flight delays and icy wings, but such inclemency meant nothing to the stalwart Cap; it was bound for Chicago. Tom’s spirits started to soar; the beginning of any journey always drove his adrenaline level high. His last published article, for a health magazine, had explored the tremendous potential of a six-week diet relying solely on plump prunes and the  close proximity of a bathroom. Tom was desperately ready for an adventure.  
  
  He walked to the front of the train and saw the twin diesel electric engines that would be pulling the Cap. He’d read about these monsters. They were General Electric P-42s, each weighing a staggering 268,000 pounds, cranking sixteen cylinders and packing 42,000 horsepower. As his gaze lingered over these hulking machines, he imagined how wonderfully they might perform on the congested Washington Beltway. What a P-42 couldn’t outrun, it would simply run over.  
  
  Walking back on a track siding that ran under the station, he saw an old, hunter-green railroad car that looked interesting. An Amtrak employee was nearby, so Tom asked what it was. The fellow answered, “That’s Franklin D. Roosevelt’s old train car, the Marco Polo, Train Number Seven. It’s owned by Norfolk and Southern now. They wine and dine VIPs there, right on the spot.”  
  
  As they stood watching, a stretch limo pulled under the tunnel near the former Roosevelt train car.  
  
  Tom said, “Are they having an early dinner on the Marco Polo? Perhaps with Churchill and Stalin?” he added with a smile.  
  
  The man didn’t get the joke. “Nope, some big shot getting on the Cap Limited. They bring ’em in that way, then there’s a ramp underneath the station the limo can go out. We do it for privacy, like sneaking movie stars through airports.”  
  
  “So who’s the big shot getting on my train? Probably some political type, right?”  
  
  The fellow looked at Tom. He appeared to be a veteran railroader with probably lots of terrific stories to tell, if only Tom had the time. “Well, if I let you in on that, it wouldn’t be a secret, now would it?”  
  
  Tom waited a bit to see who’d get out of the limo, but no one ever did. The odds of an eventual sighting were high, though, since once on the train it would be difficult for the VIP to stay concealed. Give Tom Langdon a train flying down the tracks, pen, paper, trusty binoculars, and full indemnity, and he’d bag a VIP every day of the week.  
  
  Today the Cap’s configuration of cars, called the “consist” in train-speak, was two engines, one baggage car, three coaches, two sleeper cars, one dining car, and one dormitory transition car. The transition car was where most of the service crew was quartered. It had high and low doors that allowed the double-decker cars to have access to the single-level cars, hence the term “transition” car. Tom kept walking until he reached a sleeping-car attendant and showed him his ticket.  
  
  “Next sleeper car down, sir. Regina will take care of you,” the fellow told him.  
  
  Tom went to see Regina. She was standing in front of an impressively large sixteen-foot-tall double-decker train car that was called, in Amtrak parlance, a Superliner, the heaviest passenger-train car in the world. Trains, although some considered them an outmoded form of travel, held an undeniable mystery for Tom. He’d read most of the classic suspense yarns that had taken place on rolling stock, and the elements for edge-of-your-seat storytelling were all there. You had the romance of sophisticated yet unhurried travel in a confined space, with a set number of suspects from all walks of life. In what he thought were the best of such stories, passengers held their breath in the darkness, blankets pulled to their chins because they could just sense something terrible was about to happen. Soon, with the tension at its peak, there’d come a slash of light, a scream, and a dull thud as a body fell. In the wee hours of the morning, the corpse, peepers wide open and skin pale as chalk, would be discovered by an incredibly dense traveling maid who’d scream her head off for about ten minutes while a pair of brooding eyes watched from a shadowy corner. Anyone unmoved by such a scenario should check his pulse, Tom strongly felt.  
  
  Regina possessed flawless, dark brown skin and seemed to be too young to be working on a train or anywhere else; in fact, to Tom, she looked like a high-school junior gearing up for her inaugural prom and first serious kiss. Tall and slender, she was personable and obviously enjoyed her work. She was wearing a red and white Christmas hat, the sort donned by Santa’s helpers at the mall, and she was assisting the nervous young couple Tom had seen holding hands in the waiting area. The priest had already checked in and was hauling his big duffel inside the train. After Regina had finished with the couple, Tom stepped forward and showed her his ticket.  
  
  She looked at the name and marked it off her list.  
  
  “Okay, Mr. Langdon, you’re on the upper level. Compartment D. Stairs are to your right and then left down the hall.”  
  
  Tom thanked her and gingerly placed a foot on the august Capitol Limited. His experience with sleeper cars was limited solely to viewing the movie North by Northwest, directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring the impeccably elegant Cary Grant, a nubile Eva Marie Saint, and a very sinister James Mason. Most fans of the movie remember the famous cropduster plane scene where Cary, dressed in his superbly tailored gray suit, is standing alone in the middle of vast, lonely farmland waiting for a meeting with the mysterious George Kaplan, who of course doesn’t exist. Some wily minds at the CIA had concocted Kaplan’s identity for their own nefarious purposes. Those folks at the Agency were always lying about something to make the world safe for democracy. Yet, to be fair, it was all in good fun and solely at taxpayer expense.  
  
  Now, the movie scene that Tom remembered most was the one that featured a lot of kissing inside Eva Marie Saint’s spacious sleeper compartment. Cary and Eva went at it pretty hot and heavy even by today’s standards. Watching it as a young man, hormones afire, Tom remembered thinking impure thoughts about all women everywhere, or at least those who looked like Eva Marie Saint.  
  
  Having seen that film, he knew that his sleeper compartment would be elegantly appointed and spacious, have room for a couple of beds, and feature a nice study area, a small foyer in which to formally receive visitors, a full bathroom with whirlpool tub, optional servant quarters, and perhaps an outdoor patio/balcony combo. There was a reason that at the end of the movie Cary and Eva had honeymooned in that very same sleeper compartment: It was bigger than any apartment Tom had ever had.  
  
  He started to climb the stairs as instructed by Regina. With luggage the going was a little tough, the stairs turning at tight ninety-degree angles. He assumed all the extra space had been devoted to the mammoth sleeper compartments. Then he looked up and realized he faced a considerable obstacle.  
  
  She was old, dressed in what looked to be a sleeping gown although it was not yet four o’clock, and was teetering on the top step coming down. Tom was on the second to the top step. He only had one more step to go, one narrow little riser to navigate, before he was off to fantasize about Eva Marie in his rolling penthouse.  
  
  “Excuse me,” he said politely.  
  
  “Coming through,” the woman announced in a thunderous baritone that actually made the rough, tough former war correspondent feel dangerously effeminate.  
  
  “If you’ll just let me squeeze past,” he replied. But that was out of the question. She wasn’t nearly so tall as Tom, but she was, to put it delicately, considerably wider in frame.  
  
  “Hi there, Regina,” the woman called down.  
  
  “Hi there, Agnes Joe,” said Regina.  
  
  Neither of them backing down, Tom and Agnes Joe engaged in an awkward tango, one foot forward, one foot back. Performed vertically on the stairs, it actually made Tom a little queasy.  
  
  Finally he said, “Agnes Joe, I’m Tom Langdon. I’m in Compartment D. If you can just step back for a sec—”  
  
  He never finished the sentence, because instead of stepping back, she gave him a little nudge. Actually it was a meaty forearm launched to the right side of his head, which sent him, already off-balance, stumbling back down the stairs, where he hit bottom and fell flat on his back.  
  
  Agnes Joe followed his plummet and was polite enough to gingerly step over his prostrate carcass. Tom very seriously doubted this was how Mark Twain had begun his cross-country railroad journey. Agnes Joe walked over to Regina, who was busy helping some other people on board and luckily hadn’t seen what had happened, for which Tom was grateful.  
After all, an elderly woman had just pulverized him at King of the Hill.  
  
  “Here you go, honeypie. Thanks for taking my bags.” Agnes Joe handed Regina some cash.  
  
  Tom picked himself up and headed over to Regina after glaring at the old woman as he passed her.  
  
  “I’ll get your bags, Mr. Langdon, just put them over there while I get everybody checked in.”  
  
  “Thank you. And it’s Tom,” he said, handing Regina a handful of dollars. She graced him with a cute little look. He glanced at Agnes Joe, who was slowly making her way back up the stairs.  
  
  “So have you been working on this train long?” he asked Regina.  
  
  “Four years.”  
  
  “That’s a long time.”  
  
  “Shoot, we have people been on this train twenty years.”  
  
  Tom looked back at Agnes Joe, who was still on the same step. Her legs were moving, but she didn’t seem to be ascending. It was actually fascinating to watch, sort of like witnessing pokey lava.  
  
  “So you know Agnes Joe?”  
  
  “Oh, sure, she’s been riding this train for ’bout, oh, ten years, or so I hear.”  
  
  “Ten years! She must really like the ride.”  
  
  Regina laughed. “I think she has family she goes to see. She’s nice.”  
  
  Tom rubbed his head where “nice” Agnes Joe had walloped him. “Is she on this sleeper car?”  
  
  “Yep, right next to you.”  
  
  Oh, joy, joy, he thought.  
  
  He went back to the stairway where Agnes Joe was, inexplicably, still on the exact same step.  
  
  “Agnes Joe, do you need some help?”  
  
  “I’m fine, honeypie. Just give me a little time.”  
  
  “Maybe if I get in front of you and pull?”  
  
  Tom’s plan was to get in front of her, run like hell, and lock himself in his magnificent suite with Eva Marie while Cary Grant kept guard outside.  
  
  “Just give me some space, sonny!”  
  
  She finished this last retort with a heavy elbow that somehow found Tom’s left kidney. By the time the pain had ceased and he was able to straighten his torso, Agnes Joe was gone. He slowly made his way to Compartment D. Damn if he didn’t feel like a war correspondent again.  
  
  chapter four  
  
  As Tom stood in the doorway of Compartment D, it occurred to him that if Cary and Eva Marie had shot the kissing scene here, North by Northwest would have been rated triple X. He wasn’t sure of the exact dimensions of this deluxe accommodation, but two normal strides later he’d bumped into the opposite wall. There was no foyer, no study, no desk, no double beds that he could see, and he was reasonably certain that the balcony/patio combo, whirlpool, and optional servant quarters were myths too.  
  
  There was a sink and a mirror and an outlet for an electric razor. The cabinet below was well stocked. He saw toilet paper, so there must be a bathroom hidden in here somewhere. There was a tiny closet in which to hang his coat, a large mirror on the far wall across from what he assumed was the bed, and what looked like an upper bunk as well. There was a chair and a fold-down table with a checkerboard engraved on it, which he could use as a desk. And the picture window was huge and gave an inviting view of the outdoors, where a few trickles of snow were starting to fall, getting him more into the Christmas spirit. The door to the compartment locked and had a heavy privacy curtain. Okay, it wasn’t bad, he decided. In truth, space-wise, it easily beat out even first class on an airplane.  
  
  This impression lasted until he opened the door and saw his private bathroom. Actually, according to the sign posted inside, this was the bathroom and the shower. He was expected to pee and shampoo in the same space? In his overseas reporting days, he’d actually endured showers consisting solely of camel spit, and that definitely wasn’t by choice.  
  
  His real dilemma here was one of capacity. He looked at his girth and then eyed the bathroom/shower. He edged closer and studied the situation some more. He was reasonably certain that he could wedge himself inside this chamber. Of course, once in, it would take three or four strong men with heavy machinery to free him. And no doubt Agnes Joe would be standing there waiting to take a shot at the one good kidney he had left.  
  
  He’d read about the unfortunate woman on a transatlantic flight who’d committed the unpardonable sin of flushing the toilet in the plane lavatory while she was still sitting on it. This seemingly innocent action somehow created a mighty suction vacuum that trapped her on the toilet seat. (He’d wanted to write a note to the plane engineers inquiring why they hadn’t tested for this unfortunate possibility.) She endured the entire flight in the fully upright position until the plane landed and an elite crew armed with giant spatulas and baby oil stormed the lavatory and freed the poor hostage. If it had been Tom, he believed he would have gnawed off his legs and broken the seal himself.  
  
  Unwilling to think about it anymore, he turned back and was about to sit down, when he saw something flash by against the wall opposite the bed. At first it didn’t register, it was so fast. But then it happened again. It was Agnes Joe. How could that be? This was a very peculiar definition of private accommodations. Then he saw the problem. The walls between compartments must open, perhaps for maintenance or reconfiguration or something, but the result was that he could see into the woman’s room. He’d bivouacked with the aforesaid dirty, spitting camels, and desert nomads whose last bathing experience had been at birth, and various other unwashed persons, with mortar fire as his alarm clock. Yet he’d never slept with an Agnes Joe, and he didn’t really want to start now.  
  
  As he went over to the wall to push it back into place, he peered through the crevice between their rooms and found himself cornea to cornea with the woman.  
  
  “You best not be peeping at me, sonny boy,” she said. “Besides, you don’t want to look at my old stuff, honeypie. Find yourself some girl closer to your own age.”  
  
  Okay, Tom thought, the lady is the town eccentric, only on rails. He decided to play along.  
  
  “Your stuff looks pretty good to me.”  
  
  “Now, don’t make me call Regina.”  
  
  “You don’t want to do that. Why mess up a nice twosome with a third wheel?”  
  
  “Don’t you try to sweet-talk me — it won’t work because I’m not that sort of girl. But we could have a drink together in the lounge car after supper and get to know each other.” She actually batted her eyelashes.  
  
  “Now that’s an offer I’d be a fool to refuse.”  
  
  She gave him a playful smile. “I’m sorry about knocking you down the stairs, Tom. My hand must have slipped.”  
  
  “If it had to happen, I’m glad it was you.”  
  
  He turned and saw Regina standing there, his bags in her hand. She glanced over at the wall and shook her head. “Did that wall pop out again? I told maintenance to check it.”  
  
  “Hi, Regina,” said Agnes Joe through the opening. She pointed to Tom. “You watch that fellow, he’s slick.”  
  
  “Okay.”  
  
  Tom pushed the wall back into place.  
  
  Regina said, “Sorry about that.”  
  
  “That’s okay. She seems pretty harmless.”  
  
  Regina gave him a sly look. “I wouldn’t be too sure about that.” She brought his bags in and then sat down on the edge of the couch that apparently transformed into a bed at midnight and pulled out a notepad.  
  
  “I’ll take your dinner reservation now. Dining car opens at five-thirty. Or if you don’t want to eat in the dining car, you can get some food from the café. It’s in the lounge car; the one past the dining car, lower level. You’ll see the staircase about halfway through on the right. Just show your ticket to Tyrone — he’s the lounge-car attendant — and tell him you didn’t eat in the dining car. It’s all free for sleeping-car passengers.”  
  
  “I’ll eat in the dining car. How about seven?”  
  
  She wrote this down.  
  
  “While you’re eating, I’ll come in and get your bed made up. And we have soda and bottled water and coffee and fruit at the top of the stairs where you came up. I check it all the time, so e  
verything’s fresh. Help yourself.”  
  
  “Is there a dress code or anything in the dining car?”  
  
  Regina looked amused. “Well, I’ve seen people wear just about anything a person can wear on this train.” Was it Tom’s imagination, or did her gaze flick in Agnes Joe’s direction? “But most people are pretty casual. Lot of families on this train, with little kids. What you’re wearing is fine.”  
  
  “That’s what I needed to know.”  
  
  He questioned her about the small size of his shower/bath, and she told him that larger facilities complete with changing room were available on the lower level on a first-come, first-serve basis. “Most of the physically enhanced people opt for that,” she added diplomatically.  
  
  As she rose to leave, Tom said, “I’m a journalist. I’m writing a story about my train trip across the country.”  
  
  She looked very interested. “Are you taking the Empire Builder to Seattle, the California Zephyr to San Fran, or the Southwest Chief to LA?”  
  
  “Southwest Chief to LA.”  
  
  “That’s a great train. The Chief has a cool history. And they’re wonderful people on board; you’ll have fun. Most people who work the Chief never want to leave.”  
  
  Tom pulled out his notepad and started jotting things down. “The way you describe it, the train almost seems like a person.",1,1756065113.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

  Tee Ray and his son lived on the back porch of an old shotgun house, one in a long row of identical houses packed along Irvine Street in a section of town known, both affectionately and derisively, as Little Angola. The house was owned by a bruiser called Thick, or Mr. Thick as he preferred, and he really didn’t want anyone living on his back porch, regardless of the paltry rent they paid. The rooms inside were rented too, for a few bucks here and there, to people so poor that Tee Ray and Jameel were at times thankful they lived outside. But winter was coming, and Tee Ray knew they had to move on. They had scratched out an existence on Mr. Thick’s sagging boards for two months, each day vowing to find another place.  
  
  But Tee Ray wasn’t working. He had been laid off from his job delivering seafood to high-end restaurants out in the suburbs. Another job had fallen through. Jobs were scarce in Little Angola. He was thirty-three, and according to the newspaper half the black men his age or younger were unemployed. Eventually, most drifted into drug trafficking. From there, they went either to prison or to the cemetery. Tee Ray was determined to avoid both. His life revolved around Jameel, who had just turned fourteen and was headed for the streets. Headed? He was already on the streets, and if they didn’t find a more stable place to live, the boy wouldn’t have a chance. His mother left him years ago; not that it mattered. She and Tee Ray had not bothered with anything close to marriage, and when the kid was four she disappeared.  
  
  Through a friend, Tee Ray met a crack runner called Tox. Real names were never used, only nicknames and aliases, and they sometimes changed weekly. Tox worked for an unnamed boss who took orders from someone else up the chain. Tee Ray didn’t know who the big boys were, nor did he care. The urban legend was that the crack that poured into Little Angola came from a Mexican cartel. The cocaine that flooded the white neighborhoods came from South America and was controlled by a local gangster, one who’d received the death penalty a year earlier.  
  
  Such matters were of little interest to Tee Ray. He was focused on survival. He’d been told that Tox was looking for an older guy, someone perhaps more dependable. The kids were used as the “cashiers,” the actual street dealers who handed over the goods as the customers handed over the cash. As the most vulnerable, they were the most likely to get busted. Their bosses worked in the shadows, always watching and ready to vanish. After a couple of years as a cashier, a kid savvy enough to avoid the cops would get himself promoted. Most, though, didn’t make it that far. Most were arrested, refused to talk, were processed through the criminal justice system, and got sent away.  
  
  Regardless of how broke he might be, Tee Ray had no plans to sell crack on the streets. He was, though, willing to move it around town, carry a gun, and take a few chances, and he was determined to survive. He would do it part-time, save some cash while looking for a real job, then move with Jameel out of Little Angola. But then everybody wanted out. Everybody wanted a job. Everybody wanted a better life away from the streets and drugs and violence and hopelessness. Tee Ray had a first cousin who worked in a tire factory, made $20 an hour, more with overtime, and had a wife who taught school. They lived in a modest tract house with flowers along the sidewalk and an aboveground pool in the back. That’s all Tee Ray wanted; nothing fancy, nothing rich. Just a dignified life built on honest labor.  
  
  Instead he was now muling crack around Little Angola on foot. He met Tox after dark in an abandoned warehouse at the end of a war-torn street that even the cops avoided. Other tough guys were moving in and out of small rooms, everyone glancing around with suspicion and no one saying much. A stray word or the wrong move might provoke gunfire. Tee Ray was acting tough because it was required, but inside his stomach was flipping. This was not where he wanted to be.  
  
  Tox said, “Nice coat. Where’d you get it?”  
  
  “Goodwill. Paid ten bucks for it. At least two sizes too big.” He took it off and dropped it on the floor.  
  
  “It’ll work. Here.” From a nail on a wall Tox lifted a bulky vest, customized with extra linings and pockets filled with small bags of rock. It felt as though it weighed twenty pounds. “A hundred bags,” Tox said.  
  
  “Where am I going?” Tee Ray asked as he slowly worked the overcoat over the vest.  
  
  “Not sure right now. The Bulls were spotted last night, so there might be trouble.” He handed Tee Ray a cheap, prepaid cell phone. “Keep that in your hand. You got a piece?”  
  
  Tee Ray reached into the right rear pocket of his jeans and produced a snub-nosed .38 with no serial number. Tox looked at it, shrugged as if it wasn’t much of a weapon, and said, “It’ll do. Just don’t use it unless you have to.”  
  
  Tee Ray almost said, “I’ve never used it,” but let it pass. He’d bought the gun from a street dealer two years earlier for protection. He couldn’t imagine actually shooting at someone. The Bulls were rival drug dealers known for their savagery, and Tee Ray felt weak in the knees. As if undercover cops weren’t enough to worry about, drug dealers also had to cope with rivals moving into their territory.  
  
  A year earlier, a now-famous drug deal in Little Angola had gone bad when two gangs and a bunch of narcs squared off in a raging gun battle in which, at times, it appeared as though everyone was shooting at everyone else. Three thugs were killed; one cop died; one was severely injured. For a month the editorials raged and the politicians railed, but after a year nothing had changed on the streets. Eight defendants were still awaiting trial. Crack was in high demand. Someone had to deliver it.  
  
  Tee Ray was certain he could avoid serious trouble, and he was determined not to use his gun. If he got caught and arrested, he would face his punishment like a man. But he would not, under any circumstances, kill anyone. He knew too many men who would die in prison. Trafficking could get you hard time, but using a gun could get you locked up forever.  
  
  He left the warehouse and drifted through the shadows and alleys of Little Angola. A chill was blowing in from the river; it was the coolest night of the season. He thought of Jameel and hoped the kid was where he was supposed to be—on the porch in a makeshift tent, reading a history lesson by the dim light of a small battery-powered lantern. If he wasn’t there, he would be at the YMCA playing basketball. He was already taller than Tee Ray, thin and limber and able to jump over the backboard. Scouts hung around the Y, and a couple had chatted with the kid. If he kept growing, he might escape the streets with an all-expenses-paid ticket to college. Tee Ray dreamed of this, but he wasn’t sure Jameel had visions of the big time. He wasn’t in love with the sport, wasn’t that motivated. Tee Ray feared his son might be one of those talented athletes who didn’t have the drive. Another head case too lazy to work.  
  
  Tee Ray’s phone vibrated. Tox told him to take a position near the river, at a place called Pier 40. Ten minutes later, Tee Ray eased into a public restroom, an empty, grimy place that reeked of too many strong odors to identify. A kid, wearing a Lakers cap, who looked to be about the same age as Jameel, walked in and said, “Tox said you got twenty.”  
  
  Tee Ray quickly handed over twenty bags. The kid was gone in seconds. Tee Ray waited in the only stall with a lock for five long minutes, then opened the door. If they had been seen, the kid was already handcuffed and the cops were waiting. But all was quiet. He hustled away, found an alley, and called Tox.  
  
  As he waited for instructions, he drifted across Little Angola. He checked the porch. Jameel was not there. He prayed he was at the Y. Tox called and told him to go to the Flea Market.  
  
  2.  
  
  The Flea Market was a city block burned and leveled by the race riots of 1968. Over time most of the charred remains were bulldozed and cleared. All the owners were either dead, gone, or indifferent, and the city eventually planted some trees, built some pavilions, and put in sidewalks and a pond. It granted permi  
ts for street vendors and merchants, and all manner of goods were for sale. The Flea Market became a busy place not only during the day, when housewives shopped the stalls for food and cheap clothing, but especially at night, when buyers from all over the city eased into Little Angola for crack and other drugs. White kids felt the area was safe enough for quick transactions. Blacks knew who was dealing and where to go. The cops had learned that if they could keep most of the traffic confined to one area, the rest of the town would be safer. Somewhat. They watched the Flea Market but seldom interfered. The trafficking could never be stopped; thus, the current wisdom was to try and maintain some order to its flow.  
  
  Current wisdom also required an occasional foray into the pit. If the dealers were not intimidated, they would grow bolder and expand their turf. Killing one or two a year became the sensible strategy.  
  
  Following instructions, Tee Ray walked to the southeast corner of the block, the darkest part of the Flea Market, an area where the streetlights were shot out with air rifles each time the city replaced them. Behind a row of empty stalls, Tee Ray met another nameless colleague. He dropped his Goodwill overcoat, removed the vest, handed it over, and quickly transferred his entire inventory in a matter of seconds. The man disappeared without a word, and Tee Ray grabbed his coat off the ground. He called Tox, who instructed him to return to the warehouse for another run.  
  
  Crump Street bordered the south side of the Flea Market and it was lined with cars parked for the night. Tee Ray was walking briskly along the sidewalk, trying to muster the courage to call Tox and tell him he was finished for now. He had just earned $300 and wanted to go find his son. A sudden movement to his left and across the street caught his attention. A figure jumped from between two cars and yelled, “Police! Freeze!”  
  
  Tee Ray froze and threw both hands into the air.  
  
  “On the ground!” the cop yelled, and Tee Ray went to his knees, his hands still as high as he could reach. The cop sprinted across the street and emerged on the sidewalk a hundred feet in front of Tee Ray. He was white and stocky and was wearing jeans, a Blackhawks jersey, a rapper’s cap, and combat boots, and he appeared to be alone. He clutched a black pistol with both hands and aimed at Tee Ray as he advanced. “Get down!” he yelled.  
  
  “Don’t shoot, man!” Tee Ray said.  
  
  The cop kept coming in a low, awkward crouch, as if dodging gunfire, then he fired. The first shot hit the sidewalk in front of Tee Ray and sprayed flecks of concrete into his face. “Don’t shoot!” Tee Ray screamed as he frantically waved his hands over his head. The second shot grazed the bulky right shoulder pad of his oversized Goodwill overcoat. The third shot nailed his left elbow and spun him around. He screamed in pain as he scrambled desperately to crawl under a parked car.  
  
  “Don’t move!” the cop yelled. He fired again, and the fourth shot hit the side of the car. Tee Ray managed to get his .38 out of his pocket. He fired twice. The first shot missed everything. The second shot, a miracle, hit his assailant in the right eye.  
  
  3.  
  
  Buck Lester had been an Eagle Scout, an honor student, an all-state wrestler, and a decorated Marine. He had crammed a lot into his twenty-eight years and had joined the police force after spending six boring months behind a desk. His time in Iraq had instilled a need for excitement, and once he became a cop he had quickly completed SWAT training and landed a spot on the undercover narcotics unit.  
  
  Narcs never work alone. Never. But on the night Buck was killed, his partner was spending half an hour with his favorite street hooker in a flophouse not far from the Flea Market. Alone, Buck became bored and got tired of waiting. He crept through the streets of Little Angola, with one eye on the southeast corner of the Flea Market. He had been ordered to make a couple of arrests that night. A quota needed to be filled. When he saw the black guy with the oversized overcoat, he knew he had a mule.  
  
  His partner’s name was Keith Knoxel, a ten-year veteran with a thick disciplinary file. Knoxel had finished his business with the girl and was walking toward the Flea Market to find Buck. He heard voices close by, then gunfire, and ran to find it. Buck was on the ground, twitching, when Knoxel arrived. Knoxel aimed his gun at the black guy, who was crouched on the curb near a car.  
  
  He wished a thousand times he’d pulled the trigger.  
  
  The black guy stood, leaned on a car, tossed his weapon, threw up his hands, and said, “He tried to kill me, man.”  
  
  “Shut up!” Knoxel yelled.  
  
  Tee Ray’s elbow was burning and bleeding. To keep from getting shot again, he fell forward and lay facedown on the sidewalk, arms and legs spread as wide as possible. He was aware that the second cop picked up his gun. He was aware that the first one was groaning and gasping, the low, sick sounds of someone breathing their last. The second cop was barking into his radio.  
  
  Soon enough, Tee Ray heard sirens.  
  
  4.  
  
  Sebastian Rudd’s law office had once been a Moose Lodge, then a tattoo parlor, then a bar that catered to low-end lawyers. The high-end crowd gathered for drinks in the fancy clubs atop the tall buildings where they worked or in the private clubs in midtown, places few street lawyers would ever be welcome. And that was fine with the street lawyers, as it was with the big-firm boys.  
  
  When the bar went down in a foreclosure, Sebastian finagled a loan and bought the building. It wasn’t much of a structure, more of an old clapboard house with additions stuck hither and yon, but what it lacked in architectural virtuosity was more than made up for in location. It was directly across the street from the city jail, a hideous, monolithic high-rise with inmates on fifteen floors and cops and lawyers crawling like ants around its doors.  
  
  Just down the street was the Old Courthouse, the heart of the city’s judicial system. Around the corner was the federal building, it too packed with courtrooms and judges and lawyers. One block over was the Central Police Station, another beehive of endless activity. And scattered conveniently among these buildings were all manner of shops owned and rented by bail bondsmen, private investigators, and street lawyers.  
  
  Sebastian Rudd was one of many. Ten years out of law school, he was steadily gaining the reputation of a lawyer who wasn’t afraid of the courtroom. Though no one kept score, he’d probably had more jury trials than any other lawyer his age. Almost all his clients were criminal defendants, most of whom Sebastian represented because he wanted the courtroom experience. He had plenty of business, though he longed for clients who could pay nice fees. They would come, he kept telling himself. Build your reputation as a skilled courtroom advocate, and you’ll never lack for clients.  
  
  Early in his career, Sebastian had realized that most lawyers, even his street brethren, really didn’t want to face juries. They talked a good game. They liked to brag about their trial calendars. They bored each other with tales of courtroom heroics. But, as Sebastian learned, trial work is incredibly stressful. It’s impossible to have a good time when a jury is in place, and most lawyers preferred just to talk about trial work. They hustled about the courtrooms making deals and plea agreements, getting motions and orders signed, and doing all manner of frantic legal work to make a buck. But give them a deadline facing a jury, and most would manage to avoid it.  
  
  Not Sebastian Rudd. He’d gotten his face in the newspaper a few times and he liked it. He’d won a couple of criminal cases no one else would take. His phone was ringing. His office was busy. He wasn’t getting rich, but he was paying his bills and driving a nice little BMW, pre-owned.  
  
  His latest secretary was named Rachel, a cute twenty-year-old who wanted to become a lawyer. She was single. Sebastian was divorced. She’d been there a month and the sexual tension was growing each day. Something was about to happen. She walked into his office on a Thursday morning and said, “You’ll never guess who just called.”  
  
  “I have to be in court in ten minutes,” Sebastian said, the same thing he said at least five times a week. “Who?”  
  
  “No name, but he asked if Mr. Rude, not Rudd, would be in a position to rep  
resent Thomas Ray Cardell.” She handed him a message slip and said, “Here’s his number.”  
  
  Sebastian’s jaw dropped. His heart froze. He fell back into his leather swivel and stared at Rachel. He finally managed to mumble, “You gotta be kidding.”  
  
  For three days, Mr. Thomas Ray Cardell had been front-page news in the Chronicle. Tee Ray, as he was known in Little Angola, was in jail, in protective custody actually, and charged with the capital murder of Officer Buck Lester. After three days of nonstop and one-sided coverage, it was well known that the drug dealer murdered the cop in a savage, execution-style killing. One report had Buck begging for his life.  
  
  “I’m not sure I want to get involved in this one,” Sebastian mumbled.  
  
  “He’s waiting for your call.”  
  
  “Did he say anything else?”  
  
  “No. A man of few words.” She turned around and headed for the door. Sebastian, as always, watched every step. Though he wasn’t sure, he believed the skirts had gotten tighter during her first month.  
  
  She closed the door. He took a deep breath, stared at the phone number, refocused, and told himself not to make the call. As a criminal defense lawyer, and one known as a brawler, he had crossed the line with the police, and there was no turning back. He had challenged their credibility in court. He’d caught them cheating. He’d called them liars when they were lying. He’d complained to their superiors. He fought for his clients, most of whom were guilty, and to the cops Rudd and his ilk were no better than the scum they represented. This, though, was different. The cold-blooded murder of a brave keeper of the peace, a decorated soldier, and a local boy at that was a crime so repulsive that no lawyer in his right mind would go near it. His reputation could be ruined. Threats and intimidation were practically guaranteed.  
  
  Thomas Ray Cardell was indeed entitled to a lawyer. That’s why the city funded the Office of the Public Defender. The PD had no choice.  
  
  Sebastian picked up the phone and dialed the number.  
 Two hours later, a short, thin black man of forty eased into Sebastian’s office and said hello. He said his name was Bradley, which didn’t fit at all. He wore a tailored black suit, starched white shirt, and a narrow red-and-yellow bow tie. With his horn-rimmed glasses and squeaky voice, he could easily have passed for a minister or an English teacher in a prep school. Anything but a drug dealer.  
  
  With prefect diction and an impressive vocabulary, Bradley described himself as an entrepreneur with fingers in lots of pies. At the top were apartment buildings and car washes. At the bottom was the real moneymaker—distribution. Tee Ray had been working for an organization that Bradley was “affiliated with.” This organization was well managed and highly disciplined. It had a policy of taking care of its own.  
  
  “It’s a crack operation, right?” Sebastian asked.  
  
  More or less. Tee Ray was a rookie, but then experience is hard to gain out there because of the risks. “How much will you charge to represent him?”  
  
  Sebastian whistled softly and found the question funny. Bradley never cracked a smile. “I think you should let the public defender handle it,” Sebastian said.  
  
  “We know the system, Mr. Rudd. Believe me, we know how things work.”  
  
  “Okay. To mount a proper defense of a man charged with the capital murder of a police officer will cost you a quarter of a million dollars.”  
  
  “That’s outrageous.”  
  
  “It is. No one can afford it. I’ve never heard of a lawyer getting a fee like that for such a case. Maybe a white-collar crook or someone like that, but not murder.”  
  
  “Why is it so expensive?”  
  
  “Because it will eat up my life until the trial is over. I’ll spend a fortune on investigators, jury consultants, expert witnesses. The State will throw everything it has at Mr. Cardell and spend whatever it takes. Trust me, Bradley, it’s a fat fee all right, but I won’t get rich off of it.”  
  
  Bradley swallowed hard and gently adjusted his glasses. He gave the impression of a man who could not be perturbed. Softly he said, “We’ll pay seventy-five thousand. That’s all. Cash. Think of the publicity you’ll get.”  
  
  Publicity was already on his mind. Sebastian nodded and smiled. He also admitted to himself it was unheard of for a criminal defense lawyer to collect a fee of $75,000 for a street crime. Cash. “I’ll think about it,” he said. “Give me twenty-four hours.”  
  
  “No problem. I assume you’ll need witnesses.” Bradley asked this as if he could snap his fingers and find all the testimony Tee Ray might need.  
  
  “Do you have witnesses?” Sebastian asked cautiously.  
  
  “Well, not yet, but I’m sure we can find some. Look, Mr. Rudd, we control the streets, not the police. This shooting happened on our turf. I’m sure there are eyewitnesses. We’ll help you find them.”  
  
  “Okay. While you’re looking, keep in mind that I prefer witnesses who are credible and have not spent time in jail.”  
  
  “That could pose a problem in our neck of the woods, but I’ll see what I can do.”  
  
  6.  
  
  On a beautiful Saturday afternoon, six days after he died, Buck Lester was given a lavish farewell, complete with a full funeral Mass at a downtown cathedral, a somber procession along streets lined with hundreds of uniformed brethren, and a full military interment with flags and guns. It was televised from beginning to end and lasted two hours.  
  
  Sebastian figured it was a good time to slip across the street and meet his new client. He visited clients in jail every week and always in one of the many attorney conference rooms on the second floor. There, they talked in private through a screen. Tee Ray, though, was the man of the moment, the hottest defendant in town, so for him there were different procedures. Sebastian was taken to a windowless room on the fourth floor, a room he had never seen before. He bitched at the guard about the extra security. The guard ignored him; the lawyers were always bitching about something.  
  
  The partition was not a wire screen but rather a thick sheet of some type of unbreakable glass with a three-inch hole in the middle of it. Sebastian stared at the hole, glanced at his watch, and waited. It was not unusual for the guards to make the lawyers wait, and wait. Bitching usually led to more waiting, but the trade-off was worth it. It was important to bitch to show the guards that they, the lawyers, were not intimidated. As a general rule, the guards despised the lawyers. The lawyers neither liked nor disliked the guards. They barely existed. They were either minimum-wage flunkies or part-time hobby cops lacking enough brains to get a real badge.  
  
  Sebastian pondered these things as he waited. The $75,000 in cash was locked in a safe-deposit box in a downtown bank. He was still debating how much to put on the books.  
  
  A door opened and a guard appeared. He was followed by Cardell, who for the occasion was wearing a Kevlar vest, a helmet, and of course the usual assortment of chains and cuffs, all for a two-minute walk down the stairs from the protective custody wing on the fifth floor. Because of the wound to his left elbow, the guards had generously cuffed his wrists in the front and not the back. Two more guards crowded behind him. Sebastian shook his head in disbelief as they went about the task of removing the restraints. Cardell stood perfectly still, his eyes on the floor. The helmet came off.  
  
  When they finished, one guard said, “You have an hour.”  
  
  To which Sebastian replied, “Bullshit. I’m his lawyer. I have as much time as I need.”  
  
  “An hour!”  
  
  “Take the damned Kevlar vest off, okay? The guy is here to see me, his lawyer. You think I’m planning to shoot my own client?”  
  
  The guards laughed at the lawyer’s stupidity. They left the room and Cardell, still wearing the vest, dropped into the plastic chair and looked through the glass. He slowly took the phone hanging by the partition.  
  
  Sebastian picked up his and said, “I’m Sebastian Rudd, your lawyer.”  
  
  “Nice to meet you. I guess I’m your client.”  
  
  “I guess you are. And you go by Tee Ray, right?”  
  
  “Tee Ray works.”  
  
  “Tee Ray, we’re not going to talk in here. I’ve heard about this room. The cops around here are pretty stupid and they probably have this place wired. I’ll go to court Monday and get an order allowing us to meet on the second floor, where the attorney conference rooms are located. Those rooms are wire free, or so we think. So, let’s just say this is our first little hey-howdy meeting. We’re set for your first appearance next Wednesday in circuit court. I’ll be there, but we’ll talk ahead of time. Any questions?”  
  
  “My son—”  
  
  Sebastian threw up a hand. “Don’t say anything, because someone is listening. I’ve talked to Jameel, and I’ve talked to your mother, Miss Luella. A delightful lady. Jameel is living with an aunt while I try to arrange housing for him and your mother.”  
  
  Tee Ray nodded with gratitude but said nothing.  
  
  Sebastian said, “Don’t say a word about your case to anyone. I know you’re in a cell by yourself but that doesn’t matter. Every other inmate is likely to be a snitch, and he’ll pop up at trial and claim that you made a full confession. I’ll file a motion to keep you in solitary confinement. I know it’s not pleasant, but it will keep you away from potential snitches. You cannot trust anyone here, Tee Ray, do you understand this?”  
  
  He kept nodding.  
  
  “I’ll be back Monday afternoon and we’ll have a long chat. Until then, not a word.”  
  
  7.  
  
  The Sunday edition of the Chronicle was chock-full of color photos of Buck’s grand farewell. The flag-draped coffin being carried from the cathedral; the pretty young widow in black; the hordes of cops in full dress (and from seven states!); the throng at the cemetery. Even the city’s polished fire trucks were used in the procession.  
  
  And on the front page of section B, Metro, there was a mug shot of Thomas Ray Cardell, the cold-blooded killer, the man who’d caused all the suffering. Next to him was a photo of his lawyer, the Honorable Sebastian Rudd, described as a “well-known criminal defense  
lawyer.”  
  
  When Rachel checked the voice mail early Monday morning, the third message came from a husky voice that promised, “If that nigger walks, Rudd’s a dead man.”  
  
  8.  
  
  Bradley came through with his promise to procure testimony. The first witness was a nineteen-year-old part-time college student who lived two blocks from the Flea Market. His name was Jacoby, and he swore to Mr. Rudd that he saw Tee Ray on his knees with his hands in the air and that he heard four loud shots, then two not as loud. He also heard Tee Ray scream, “Don’t shoot!” but the shots kept coming. Jacoby claimed to be lurking in the shadows because he was in the process of sneaking into the Flea Market to buy some pot for himself and a friend. The friend happened to be the girlfriend of a rather rough character, thus the sneaking around.  
  
  A month before the trial, Jacoby disappeared. Vanished without a trace. The police searched and investigated and went through the motions but found no sign of Jacoby. Sebastian had warned him that he could be in danger, and the kid claimed to be lying low. His mother said she had been concerned because he had been flashing around some cash, but she had no idea where it had come from. A week into the search, Jacoby called home, said he was in L.A. with some new friends and wasn’t coming back.  
  
  Bradley and his boys swung into high gear and found another witness, an unindicted felon named Rufus. He claimed to have seen and heard everything, just like Jacoby. Sebastian spent hours with Rufus and became convinced the man could handle the rigors of a trial. He could stick to his story and withstand a brutal cross-examination.  
  
  9.  
  
  The State’s case against Tee Ray was built upon the solid eyewitness testimony of Officer Keith Knoxel. By the time he had secured the murder scene, put the handcuffs on Tee Ray, and followed the ambulance to the hospital, Knoxel had created, rehearsed, and refined his story. Without a word about the hooker, Knoxel claimed to have been just on the other side of Crump Street, not far at all from Buck, when he too saw the black guy in the oversized overcoat. He heard voices and began to cross the street to cover his buddy. The black guy charged Buck as they exchanged fire. Then, somehow, Buck dropped his weapon, and Mr. Thomas Ray Cardell shot him in the face. It had all happened so fast, but there was no doubt in his mind. He had witnessed a murder.  
  
  The chief prosecutor was a blustering, hard-charging climber named Max Mancini, and Max was finding it impossible to keep his picture out of the papers. He was pushing for a speedy trial. There would not be a plea bargain. It was a clear-cut death penalty case. Anything remotely related to the upcoming trial of the cop killer required either a press conference or a serious sit-down interview. Every motion was hotly contested and reported on.  
  
  Sebastian moved for a change of venue. The hearing took two days and the courtroom was crowded. The motion was denied. Sebastian filed a notice of a claim of self-defense, and Mancini offered his thoughts to a reporter. Sebastian moved for a gag order in an effort to stifle the prosecutor, but the judge said no.  
  
  The pretrial maneuverings were intense as the clock ticked. Through it all, Sebastian skillfully eliminated a few crucial elements of the State’s theory. For example, the press had labeled Tee Ray a drug dealer, but there was no proof of this. He had not been in possession of anything when he was arrested. He had admitted nothing. He was not known to the police to be involved with trafficking. Simply walking down a street at night near the Flea Market was not evidence of guilt. His gun, the alleged murder weapon, was indeed an illegal firearm. It was unregistered and its serial number had long since disappeared. However, and much to the surprise of everyone, the Beretta 9-millimeter fired by Buck Lester was also unregistered. Apparently, it was a leftover from his Marine days and he preferred it over the 9-millimeter Colts issued by the city police. Sebastian doubted the prosecution would get near the topic of illegal firearms. The jury might expect a guy like Tee Ray to carry one, same as everyone else in Little Angola, but not one of the city’s finest young policemen.  
  
  The cops and Max Mancini had failed in their efforts to create testimony. Sebastian had succeeded in keeping Tee Ray in protective custody, in a cell by himself, and had thus prevented the involvement of any of the prosecution’s web of snitches. They were career deadbeats, most of them druggies, and they were always in jail for small-time felonies. The cops would feed them the details of a crime, stick them in the cell with the accused, and—presto!—get a new witness who’d heard a full confession. After the snitches lied under oath to the jury, the charges against them would be either reduced or lost in the paperwork.  
  
  Just for the hell of it, Sebastian filed a formal motion that he labeled “Motion to Prevent the Police and the Prosecutor from Employing the Use of Jailhouse Snitches to Attempt to Elicit Fabricated Testimony from the Defendant.” The motion was deemed out of order and overruled, but the point was made.  
  
  10.  
  
  Two weeks before the trial, Rufus was pulled over for allegedly driving through a stop sign without making a complete stop. He argued with the officer, who called for backup. Two other patrol cars arrived and Rufus was handcuffed. In his rear floorboard, a policeman found a shipping carton with a pound of crack.  
  
  Rufus swore he’d never seen it before, swore it was planted by the cops.  
  
  Sebastian visited him in jail and told him he was lucky he hadn’t been shot. He wasn’t sure if Rufus would now be useful at trial. Sebastian would make a decision in a day or so. Meanwhile, he would speak with Bradley, the financier, and try to arrange bail. Rufus asked if he would be safer in jail than out. Sebastian wasn’t sure.  
  
  As he was leaving the jail and crossing the street back to his office, a young man in a rumpled suit caught up to him and said, “You’re Sebastian Rudd, right?”  
  
  “I am.”  
  
  “I’m Walter Branch, a new lawyer in town. Just down the street.”  
  
  Sebastian stopped, smiled, offered a hand, and said, “Yes, I think I’ve seen you around.”  
  
  “A pleasure. Look, we need to talk, and soon. Like right now. Preferably in a room with complete privacy.”  
  
  “My office is right here.”  
  
  “How about the coffee shop around the corner.”  
  
  “And this is urgent?”  
  
  “Trust me.”  
  
  Branch paid for two espressos and they huddled in a corner, as far away from the other three customers as possible. As Branch spooned in some sugar, he glanced around, and in a low voice began, “I have this client, kid’s a real mess. Twenty years old, part-time college student, full-time crackhead. He’s been through every rehab clinic this side of Betty Ford. Nothing sticks. They lock him up for two months, he stays clean for a week, then back on the crack. Very sad. Pathetic really. Family has a ton of money, so they keep shucking out big bucks, hoping some clinic somewhere can find the magic cure. Not likely to happen. Anyway, the kid knows what happened when the cop got shot.”  
  
  Sebastian stared out the front window and watched the pedestrians hurry by. “And how does he know this?”  
  
  “He was there. In a parked car with a buddy, both stoned to hell and back. In fact his friend, still unnamed, had passed out in the driver’s seat. My client was on the passenger’s side, the sidewalk right beside him. He says he saw the black guy, Mr. Cardell, walk by him, headed west, and the cop came out of nowhere, yelling and then firing. Says your guy hit his knees, threw up his hands, and the cop kept shooting. Finally, your guy got hit, sort of rolled to one side, and whipped out a gun. A helluva shot.”  
  
  Sebastian sipped his espresso. “That’s identical to Cardell’s version.”  
  
  “Right. And there was no second cop on the scene until the shooting was over. My client even thought for a moment that the second cop was gonna shoot Cardell. He didn’t, though, because he was freaking out over his buddy. My client slid lower in his seat, afraid he might be seen, and he eventually slipped out of the car and got away without being noticed.”  
  
  “So why can’t he testify?”  
  
  “That’s where it gets complicated. This is a p  
rominent family. The kid’s parents are divorced. Everybody’s been through rehab. Calling the family dysfunctional would be giving it a compliment. The money was made by the grandfather, who still controls it all. A real prick. Tightfisted, arrogant, hard-nosed, domineering, really rough on his family because the family is so screwed up. He’s spent a fortune trying to get this kid clean and sober. Good money down the drain. Now he’s fed up. The kid turns twenty-one next year, and when that happens some trust funds kick in, courtesy of Gramps. Gramps, however, retained the right to revoke the trusts, and he’s been threatening to do so. About a year ago, he gave the kid an ultimatum—get clean or forget about the money. So the kid’s been kissing Granddaddy’s ass and telling him that all is well, no drugs, lots of studying in college, loves being sober, and so on. He manages to stay clean when he’s around the old man, but when he’s not he’s back to his old habits. He can’t help it. Frankly, the last thing this kid needs is a load of cash, but the trust funds are there and he sees easy street.” Branch paused for a sip.",1,1756065024.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1mz5ib9,https://www.reddit.com/r/FitnessforHealthcare/comments/1mz5ib9/habit_anchoring_the_smart_route_to_consistency/,Habit Anchoring: The Smart Route to Consistency,"When motivation is low—and let’s face it, after a 13-hour shift it usually is—the only thing that keeps you consistent is habit. One of the most effective tools for building habits is anchoring.

Habit anchoring means tying a new behaviour to something you already do. Research in the *British Journal of Health Psychology* shows that people are far more likely to stick with a new habit if it’s linked to an existing routine. For example, “After I hand over, I’ll walk for five minutes” or “Once I make my post-shift tea, I’ll stretch for 10 minutes.”

This works because it removes decision fatigue. You don’t have to “find motivation”—your environment and routine do the work for you. Psychologists call this an “implementation intention,” and studies show it makes habits far more likely to stick.

If you want to be consistent with fitness or nutrition during shifts, start small. Pick one habit and anchor it to something that already exists in your day. Think:

* After brushing teeth → prep tomorrow’s snacks.
* After work shoes off → do 5 squats.
* After pouring coffee → 5 minutes of stretching.

These little anchors create a rhythm that feels natural. Over time, they snowball into consistency—and consistency is what gets results, even with a shift-work schedule.",1,1756064937.0,FitnessforHealthcare,0,1.0,False

So I went on one date with this guy last Wednesday who I met on Hinge and on paper we are so compatible. Similar world views. We both are left leaning politically, not religious, and not interested in having kids. Being from Texas its so hard to find dudes like that and I have a huge crush on this guy. The coffee date was fun and we both enjoyed the conversation!

So here is where the confusion starts. So I drove back home and was the one to text him first. \*I\* told him that I had a good time and asked if he made it home okay. He responded an hour later and said that he made it home and had fun too. Then once again \*I\* asked him if he wanted to meet again. And he said yes he did the next day in the afternoon.

He had a vasectomy scheduled for this Friday and he said ""Yes I wanna meet again. Lets figure something out after my big surgery and see how im doing lol"".

Just a guy who misses and looking for a girl that is fine with a casual intimacy. A girl who misses being touch, getting dominated, and getting babied in bed. A someone fine with being casual and not ready to commit in relationship. 

A someone that is not too aggressive, just a normal or soft girl that wants to be submissive. A girl that is open for giving blowjobs and hanjobs.

I'm open for inexperienced girls that wants to try getting eaten, fingers, or getting a dick inside you.

It could be a one time thing or a long term casual intimacy. Pero it's much nicer if it's long term.

1mz56ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScrapyJLessons/comments/1mz56ia/lifes_test/,Life's test,"**Life's Test**

You know, I have been alive 42 years now. I have seen death, life, love and hate. I would like to say I have been around enough humans to know I know how people work. Yet, I can't human will and attitude are so questionable it's not even funny. My question is, why do people so self centered. From my experience self centered people tend to be the biggest cowards on this earth. I say that because of the last few years of dealing with it and healing. The baby momma, is prime example. I loved this woman, I loved her enough to be the father of my baby and to not run away when I became a father. I stayed behind to take abuse, only for her to blame me for her own mental illness. I mean, while we was together, I did not do drugs, I really didn't drink unless WE were out. I worked and supported the 3 of us. When she stayed at home popping xanax and drinking. She was slowly deteriorating. Day after day she was only getting worse. I just took it, while she was burning up our money on drugs and alcohol. She says I became an asshole and abusive. Ya know, I have never hit a woman until her. The first time, I hit her was after she beat the shit out of me while i was holding our oldest daughter. She beat the shit out of me from behind as I stood up curled up over my daughter keeping her from getting hit. I slapped her down to get her to stop that day. You might ask why it happened. To be honest I really don't know, I came home that day from work. Only to find her drunk in the 2nd bedroom, sitting on the floor with my oldest next to her in her car seat. She was drunk and sitting with a half empty case of Bud Light, and a knife in her hand. Talking about how she wanted to kill herself, I grabbed my daughter, and told her I was not going to fight with her, and was about to call the cops. Soon as I turned my back she attacked. She went to jail that day. 60 days apart, without seeing my baby. Only God knows where she was. Some of the time she spent at my dads. The rest is unknown. 

The second time, was so much worse. I accepted her back, because she had my daughter. She was promising me the world, and blaming me for the incident. I just shut up and took it. Day in day out. We moved to a new apartment a town over. I guess all the stress from the move and all the drama caused me to have one of the biggest seizures I ever had. They seizure specialist upped my dose of seizure meds. (which in the future, I found out did more harm that good) I come home she is drunk, and fucked up on all kinds of shit that only God knows. So the belligerent love of my life started her shit talking. Rambling about how shitty I am, how big of a piece of shit I am. That she is going to leave and I would never see my daughter again ever. SNAP I fucking snapped at this point. She threatened to take my daughter from me. When in reality that was the only reason I was with her at this point. I knocked this shout of out her. I knocked her out. When she woke up, she woke up with my foot on her chest and a rifle pointed at her head. I told her flat out, if she ever threatens to take my daughter from me again I would kill her. I took my foot off her, unloaded the rifle and left. A few weeks later I left 100% I moved back in with my mom. I left because I have never threatened anyone like that, and I was lucky she did not go to the cops for it. Yet, I did not want to risk going to prison over her either, so it was easier for me to leave. We saw each other on a regular basis, I guess she got the hint. That she had my baby and I meant what I said. During that time we still had regular sex, still went on dates. Well she ended up pregnant again. 2 years later to give birth to our second daughter.

The day of our second daughters birth, she called me that morning. She told me she was going into labor and I needed to pick her up. So I did, we rented a hotel room next to the hospital and stayed there a few hrs before it was time to actually give birth. My mother took my oldest. She gave birth to my youngest, another beautiful daughter. Only to have complications MAJOR ones. They found almost every drug known to man in my daughter blood. From meth, to opiates. To make matters worse all the drug use, deformed my youngest and she needed an emergency heart surgery. The hospital she was born at could not perform this surgery on an infant, and got a ride to a big children's hospital . They fixed my little one 14 hours after her birth  she had open heart surgery. CPS shown up shortly after and gave me temporary custody of both my daughters. Which I hired a lawyer to get full custody of both my daughters. Baby momma claims she just gave up all rights, when in fact she had no other option. She avoided court the law everything. I got full custody without a fight. 

3 years my little fought for her life. We was back and forth to the hospital over a sneeze. It was a nightmare, but my girl was a fighter. She fought to live. All the while my baby momma was getting herself deeper and deeper into a drug induced frenzy. She got so freaking skinny she could have been a spokesperson for anexoria.  She would show up at the house all fucked up on drugs and I would run her off. I told her if she wanted to see the girls, she had to be sober and I stuck to my guns. I did not want my babies to see their mother like that at all. Also, during that time I still loved my baby momma more than the world could know. I would sneak out to be with her. With the promise if she ever got her shit together I would wait for her. It never happened. 13 years later nothing really has changed she is still who she is with a bunch of new tricks. She eventually got put in prison. She had a son before she went to prison who was born with major mental illness and his grandparent on the dads side took custody. While in prison she gave birth to another daughter. The state took that child. When she got out we all had so much hope for this woman. She fought to get her 3rd daughter back from the state, which she won. Shortly after she had another daughter which makes 4 daughters. My girls, have never been withheld from her. All she had to be was sober and schedule a time for visit.

She was doing great or so it appeared to be that way. She got a house of her own, a car and was seeing the girls regularly. About 3 years later it started to fall apart for her again. This time I was no longer sheltering my girls from her and her fuckups. Why might you ask? The answer for the question is easy. I do not want my girls to hate me from keeping them from their mother. That simple, I made it to where if she was going to mess up her relationship with the girls it would be on her own terms. Slowly but surely she started to disappear. Most recently she has acted out against my oldest daughter, causing my daughter to start crying in front of her friends on her 15th birthday. My oldest now is starting to see her mother for who she really is and recently declined to even talk to her. My little one is starting to pick up the same feelings too, because she is starting feel abandoned...... 

That is the background story. Now for her tactics. My baby momma has the gift of gab. She loves to hear herself talk. When she got out of prison she found Jesus. Yet, what it looked like from the outside was. She only found Jesus and religion because of the perisionors helped her a ton. They gave her a job, a car, clothes and food. She would always accuse me of stealing her daughters from her, instead of taking the responsibility, that she lost her daughters because of her drug habits and prison. Which is happening to her again. Now days every time she gets in a hard spot she starts quoting the bible, but not because she believes it. Yet, because she thinks it makes her look better than just admitting her faults. She is queen of playing victim, she can cry one second and stop the next. In my opinion she is a con artist, and uses religion as a scapegoat and to gaslight everyone. I told her yesterday there is a difference in knowing the bible and practicing its teachings. Which she does not practice its teachings, unless someone is looking at her that she can manipulate to personal gains or to save her ass. I have seen her do it, and tried to do it yesterday to my youngest. She still tries to blame me for everything, even tried to accuse me of manipulating the girls to hate her. NOT once have I told the girls to hate her or even tried to manipulate them into something negative.   She cannot take responsibility for her own wrong doings and lack of being a real mother to my girls. Hell, yesterday she tried to make me out to be the bad guy about what I did when we last lived together. She cant and wont take credit for, the fact of. If she never threatened to take my daughter from me, she would have never had her life threatened or would have looked down a barrel. I love my daughters enough to kill for them. I might not have the greatest life on this planet, but my daughters are the best thing in my life. Yeah, I overreacted that night,  and to be honest if I was not on the seizure meds that night would not have happened like it did. Which is one of the reasons why I no longer take seizure meds. They made it to where I could not control my anger. I would react instead of think and use my logic. Things have been so much better since I have been off the medications. I will just suffer the seizures as they come. BUUUT back to baby momma. She blames me for everything. What she does not get is. If I hated her, If I wanted her out of the girls life, if I wanted her gone, all I would have to do is just make it happen. I mean, if she can't pass a drug test I don't have to let her see the girls, If she does not properly schedule a visit I don't have to let her see them. I could block her phone numbers from the girls phones. I could report her to child support division. There is so many things I could do to keep her out of the girls lives, but she does not get it. I give her every fucking chance to see them. She told my youngest yesterday, that no one would fix her car. ""my little one knows thats a lie cause she was there when I told her I would fix her car"" she never shown up for me to fix it. She has told my girls that she was getting a new car, that she was trading in her car for a new car. She gave so many excuses that you just know she is lying. Hell I did not have to let her come to my house this week to video chat with the girls. Yeah, she came to the house, she recently has given up her other girls, got caught by the police and put into a mental hospital and had nowhere to go. So I let her come here until she could find somewhere else to go. Pending her making peace and not war. It did not last 30 hrs before she started her verbal insults and abuse. She flipped out when my oldest told her she did not want to talk to her anymore. She claims she is drug and alcohol free, that she isn't addicted to anything. Yet, while she was here asked if she could have a shot of my tequila that I taped  closed to keep her from lying to me, if she opened it. 

From the time she got here she was fairly decent, but was me, me, me me. Can I have this, can i do this, can i listen to this, she acted like a 5 year-old with no manners. If I was watching tv, she would beg to change the channel to listen to music. If I was listening to music while working, and I walked off to pee, she would change it. Hell she even changed to station in the car when I just went to get some cigs. She drank at least 20 cups of coffee. I mean it was all about her. Not once did she ask whats my plans, or how life is really going. Yet, she was making plans on staying longer than a few days. Talking about the things she was going to do while she was here long term. She had no interest in me and what was going on in my life. Yet, when I asked what happened or what was going on in her life, was so coded and scrambled together you couldn't make out shit. It all sounded like lies and excuses. Talking about the cops are out to get her, that my family is out to get her, talking about how she is sex trafficked. I mean she was total space cadet. I will admit, she did clean up some of my shop, which she patted herself on the back quite hardcore, she did do her laundry while she was here, and finished up my laundry that I started before she got here. Which I am thankful for. The first night I worked all night and she didn't talk to the girls because the girls had school events to handle. I went to bed the next morning, she never slept, at all. Just constantly drinking coffee, and moving around the house and yard. When she I did wake up the few times when I was trying to sleep it was just her asking one thing after another, and nothing that I could help her with. Like, lets go do something, lets go see the girls, lets lets lets... When I damn sure don't have the money for right now, which I have said many times already. She would only get more frustrated when I told her no. The whole time she was here was like taking care of a five year old child that ate a ton of candy. 

When it came to the phone call, my little one wanted to talk. She rambled and rambled so much bullshit, I am sure my daughter could not make any sense of her bullshit. She gaslighted her, and played victim and blamed everyone around her for the reason she is in the position she is in. I stopped her several times. Only to get cussed at and fingers pointed at me for. When it came to talking to my oldest, she did not want to talk at all. Yet, she did leave a message for her momma. To pretty much start being an adult, get a job, a car, a phone, and to start acting like a real mother and that she loved her. Baby momma exploded after this. Blaming me for everything, talking about made up conspiracy's about how I am brain washing my girls. That my family is the reason why she is in the position she is in. Hell she even lied to my face claiming that her father paid 100% of all child support and future child support and that I stole it. Then told me I am not the girls father. At this point I asked her to leave, which she denied. So I called the cops to have her removed. I would have not called them but she antagonised me till I did. Call them I dare you, just call them. LoL okay. So I did. Only for her to beg for me to hang up when I really did. The cops shown up and gave me 2 options. 1. That he can removed her from the property but has to run her background check. Which she would have ended up back in jail, because she has a warrant out for her arrest. 2. that she just stops and calls someone to pick her up and for her to chill out until they come to pick her up, and that If she starts her shit again I have every right to run her off the property and if I had to call the cops again that she would get picked up by the police this time. I let her make her call to her friend. Now If I hated her and wanted her in jail........ Why would i pick option number 2? I bet you money she has made me the bad guy to her friend that picked her up. I bet you money I have been slandered so bad that its possible her friend and her are plotting something against me. I know she won't take responsibility that she is the reason why she was asked to leave. 

The secret, I still love this woman, and I still have hope she gets better. Hell she still turns me on instantly at the thought of her touching me and me holding her. She is the first love of my life, the mother of my kids, but logically I know better. Soulfully there is always that deep deep feeling of hope and love for this woman to get better.  I don't plot anything on her. Nor do I manipulate the girls to hate her. The girls are old enough to see their mother for who she really is. So until she can take accountability for herself she will never get better. She comes of extremely self centered, unless its doing something that she can benefit from, and use as ammo against you. She tries to use religion as a scapegoat and a diversion to make herself seem better that what she really is. She does not practice what she preaches. The minute you turn your back to her she is doing something that goes against everything written in the bible. To be honest thats why I think her life started to fall apart a year ago. I think she got caught red handed by the people who was trying to help her. The ones who gave her a job, (which she claims she quit, when I think she was fired), the ones who gave her a car and home. Thats why I personally keep my distance from her, yet let the girls see and do what they want with her. She is dangerous to me, because I do love her, but not going to make myself vulnerable to her every again. Anyways thats just me venting today. you guys have a great day. Thanks for reading.

Four Seasons Orlando delivers exactly what you'd expect from the brand: flawless execution, thoughtful details, and service that feels effortless even at scale. This is luxury hospitality applied to the Disney experience, and it works beautifully. At 443 rooms, this is no boutique property, yet it manages to feel intimate and personalized throughout your stay. If you've always done Disney-owned hotels and wonder whether stepping outside the bubble is worth it, this property makes a compelling case that sometimes the best Disney experience happens when Disney isn't running the show.

The resort succeeds because it understands its mission: to be a serene, sophisticated home base for families who want to do Disney parks during the day and retreat to genuine luxury at night. It's not trying to be Disney-themed or compete with the magic. Instead, it offers something Disney properties can't: world-class hospitality standards, adult-level dining, and the kind of service recovery that makes problems disappear before you notice them.

**Location and Setting**

The resort sits within the exclusive Golden Oak community on Disney property, about 10-15 minutes from the Magic Kingdom and with convenient access to all four parks. You're technically on Disney grounds, which means you get some Disney perks, but you're removed enough to feel like you're staying somewhere special rather than in the middle of a theme park complex. The property itself is beautifully integrated into the community, with meticulously maintained landscaping that feels more like a private estate than a hotel.

The location strikes the perfect balance: close enough for easy park access via the resort's motorcoach service, but far enough removed that you can actually unwind after long days in the parks. No monorail noise, no crowds streaming past your windows, no character breakfast chaos bleeding into your morning coffee.

**Brand and Property Context**

This opened as Four Seasons' first family-focused resort in the United States, and the brand's approach to kids programming and family amenities shows serious thought and investment. Unlike many luxury hotels that treat families as an afterthought, Four Seasons Orlando was designed from the ground up to serve both adults who expect five-star service and kids who want to have fun.

The property operates more like a resort community than a traditional hotel, with multiple pools, extensive grounds, and enough activities that you could easily spend days here without leaving for the parks. This isn't a place you just sleep between Disney days - it's a destination that happens to offer convenient Disney access.

**Accommodations**

**Four Seasons Orlando: 443 rooms and suites**

**Rooms:** The accommodations nail the family luxury brief. Our Golden Oak View Room was genuinely spacious and comfortable, with thoughtful touches like no minibar cluttering the space (those overpriced snacks live at the restaurants where they belong). The nightly turndown service included setting up the pullout bed without being asked - exactly the kind of anticipatory service that separates luxury brands from premium ones.

The rooms feel residential rather than hotel-generic, with quality furnishings and enough space that a family doesn't feel cramped after park days. Views vary significantly depending on your room category - ours included Golden Oak residences, parking areas, and some nearby construction, but since we were barely in the room except for mornings and evenings, it didn't matter. The resort appropriately offered construction view credits, which more than compensated.

**One design quibble:** The trendy barn-style bathroom door looks great in photos but offers limited privacy for families. At a family-focused luxury property, functional privacy should trump Instagram aesthetics.

**Food and Drink**

The dining program is where Four Seasons Orlando really shows its strength. This isn't hotel food or theme park fare - it's serious restaurant-quality cuisine across multiple concepts, all under one roof.

**Capa** is the showstopper: the signature rooftop restaurant that would hold its own in any major city. The dessert program alone is worth the reservation, and the elevated Spanish-influenced menu offers the kind of sophisticated dining that Disney properties simply don't provide.

**Ravello** handles both breakfast and dinner service competently, offering buffet or à la carte breakfast options and solid Italian cuisine for dinner. This is also where they host the weekly Goofy character breakfast - a nice nod to the Disney connection without making the whole property character-themed.

**PB&G** covers casual lunch perfectly, with dishes substantial enough to fuel park days. The fish tacos and popcorn shrimp starter (which easily serves as a full meal) hit the right notes for poolside dining.

**Lickety Split** is more than just a coffee shop - the gelato program and macaron selection rival standalone patisseries. The early 6:30 AM opening makes it perfect for grab-and-go items before rope-dropping parks.

The variety means you can eat well without leaving the property, but more importantly, the quality means you'll want to. This is destination dining that happens to be convenient, not convenient dining that happens to be adequate. My big beef with WDW is that the food is highly average to legitimately terrible. It's nice to get a break from the overpriced garbage when you're visiting.

**Spa and Recreation**

The pool complex is genuinely spectacular and represents a significant upgrade from even Disney's best aquatic offerings. The lazy river here actually delivers on the lazy promise - it's designed for genuine relaxation rather than the controlled chaos you'll find at Disney's resorts. Unlike the themed but often overcrowded Stormalong Bay (which I love, truly and is for good reason Disney's pool gold standard), Four Seasons Orlando creates multiple distinct pool environments that never feel packed, even during peak times.

The spa operation is expansive and well-thought-out, featuring an outdoor hot tub and a spacious co-ed relaxation room that provides genuine refuge from theme park intensity.

The dedicated kids and teen areas looked impressive and purposeful during our visit, designed with the same attention to detail as the adult spaces. Something they offer here which I really appreciate is an alternative to Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique - you can do the same makeover here but without the insanity of being in the park.

**Service and Operations**

This is where Four Seasons Orlando validates its brand positioning. Service felt effortless and personalized throughout, despite the property's significant size. The pre-arrival concierge team was proactive and helpful months before our stay, and on-property staff consistently recognized returning guests - a impressive feat at 443 rooms.

Housekeeping deserves particular recognition. Scheduling services through the app worked flawlessly, with turndown and cleaning completed exactly as requested during our breakfast and dinner times. The thoughtful touches like nightly postcards at turndown show a service culture that goes beyond efficiency to create genuine hospitality moments.

Poolside service struck the perfect balance: attentive and accommodating without being intrusive. Staff anticipated needs without hovering, and requests were handled promptly and professionally.

The transportation program works just fine - truthfully this is my one sticking point with staying at FS Orlando. The parks are spread out and Disney has their transportation DIALED. However, while you lose the constant Disney transportation access, the motorcoach service runs reliably to all four parks with comfortable vehicles and professional drivers. It's fine. For rope-dropping or very specific timing, Uber and Lyft are probably (IMO) the best options, but the resort transportation handles most needs well.

**Disney Integration**

Four Seasons Orlando manages Disney proximity intelligently. You get legitimate Disney property benefits without Disney property chaos. The resort doesn't try to out-Disney Disney with character experiences and theming everywhere - instead, it offers what Disney properties can't: genuine luxury hospitality standards and adult-level amenities.

The weekly character breakfast provides Disney magic for kids who want it, while the rest of the property maintains sophisticated resort atmosphere for adults who need to recover from park intensity. It's the best of both worlds executed thoughtfully.

They also have a dedicated Disney Planning desk to help you game out your visit (because unfortunately it has become PHD level complicated) and they also have a little more luck with getting VIP guides. 

**Final Takeaways**

If you want to do Disney parks while staying at a genuinely luxurious resort, Four Seasons Orlando delivers exactly that experience. The service standards, dining quality, and property amenities represent significant upgrades from Disney-owned hotels, while the location and transportation maintain park convenience.

This property succeeds because it doesn't try to be Disney - it tries to be Four Seasons, and applies that expertise to the Disney vacation experience. The result is a resort that enhances rather than competes with park days.

**Who This Resort Is For**

* Families who want luxury hospitality standards during Disney vacations
* Guests who appreciate serious dining options and spa amenities between park days
* Travelers who value personalized service and attention to detail at scale
* Parents who want sophisticated adult spaces while providing quality kids programming
* Disney veterans ready to upgrade their accommodation experience significantly

**Who This Resort Is Not For**

* Guests who want to stay immersed in Disney theming and character experiences 24/7
* Travelers who prioritize being steps from park entrances over resort amenities
* Families who prefer Disney's transportation ecosystem over resort motorcoach service
* Budget-conscious visitors who don't value luxury hospitality upgrades
* Guests who want the energy and chaos of Disney resort properties

1mz5629,https://i.redd.it/uwf1vn6620lf1.jpeg,Rise & Shine - Searching for the best biscuit in Denver,"Last Sunday I had a great buscuit sandwich from DBC on Tennyson but after seeing all the hate on a recent post, I decided to branch out and find The Best Biscuit Sandwich in Denver™

To make things fair and try to make comparisons as close to apples to apples, or biscuits to biscuits in this case, I will attempt to order the same meal at each location as follows:

Biscuit Sandwich with a fried chicken patty, some variation of egg, bacon, cheese and some potatoes, preferably hashbrown if available.

On to today's review:

They say the early bird gets the worm but to my dismay it appeared I was not early enough as I arrived at Sloan's Lake Rise & Shine Location. The restaurant was bustling with a line that had forcibly breached the door and was spilling onto the sidewalk. At the levels of biscuit addiction I found myself at, I knew I was prepared to wait as long as need be. Much to my surprise, the spinster operating the register possesed the energy and speed to dwindle the line before my very eyes and quickly I was placing my own order. 

The simplicity of the menu allowed me to laser target focus on the subject of my obesession. A Chapel Hill with Egg, Cheese and Bacon.  My order placed, I proceeded to the small bar built into the service counter while I impatiently waited to be called.

Now that my attention was free to wander around the room I took in the patrons and room at large. In the style of a small cafe, Rise and Shine had a very comfy and unpretentious atmosphere. Artwork ringed the room, their frames resting on exposed red brickwork. There were families here of all varieties, as well as couples and the odd solo adventurer like myself.  We were all here as part of our own journey but united in our shared experience of coffee and/or biscuits. I myself do not partake of the brew but the reader should be encouraged that I heard one of the patrons exclaim to her table that ""The coffee here is actually quite good.""  

Before I could really take a look at the artwork,  I was brought forth from my obversvations as I heard my name called from the counter. It was biscuit time.

Since the weather had taken a turn for the cooler side this morning, I decided to take my breakfast out to the benches I had spied outside earlier. I laid out my treasure and took the picture in the post while I fought my salivating taste buds. 

Biting into the sandwhich I immediately noticed the fresh ""homemade"" taste of the folded egg, blasting me with a nostaligic sense that real love and care had gone into the meal I was about to eat. Followed quickly on the heels of the egg, the crispy, savory chicken came into the mix proudly announcing its presence.  While so far everything seemed great, unfotunately there were some issues that appeared torwards the end of that first bite. The chicken was overcooked and with a lack of any accompning sauce, things were trending torwards dry. 

I swallowed (phrasing) and decided to shake things up and try out the hashbrown to change the pallete. And the recognition was near instantaneous. These were the same hashbrowns as McDonald's or even Trader Joe's, that is to say that these were your mundane frozen hashbrown patties. The incongruency was palpable. 

Turning back to finish the sandwich, disappointment leading me leave the hashbrown for last, I rounded out my opinion on the sandwich itself. The biscuit was buttery and flaky but I guess I am learning I prefer crumbly? The bacon was crispy and made its appearance known, no complaints in that department. When it came to the cheese I actually had to check if I had ordered it followed by a close examination to ensure that yes, it was not missed in the assembly process. Better cheese would have helped elevate the sandwhich. 

Overall I left Rise & Shine with the feeling that yes, this is a biscuit sandwich and while the bill came at half of what I paid just a week ago at DBC, my satisfaction was also at half mast. Could it be the absence of beer or sauce? I do think the chipotle ranch from last week would have helped here with the chicken that was on the drier side. And beer... well I don't think I need to explain that one. 

If you've made it this far, thanks for coming along for the ride. Please leave any recommendations you have to help fuel my biscuit dreams. This is a passion project and I shouldn't be eating biscuit sandwiches every weekend or at least that's what the misses tells me so don't expect another post for a bit. 

But biscuits beware, I am at large, and I will biscuit again. ",17,1756064163.0,denverfood,11,0.77,False

Hi. I am 34 y/o female dating a 40 y/o male. We have been together for 4.5 years. While we have a good relationship when it's good, when there is any issue on the table, even small, I feel we couldn't be worlds further apart speaking different languages.

I feel borderline desperate for relatable conversation that is why I am here. I am too afraid to share what is actually going on with the people closest to me, in fear of judgment for my fiance. It just sounds bad when I say it out loud, but somehow I feel very confused and sad. I believe what I am feeling is the aftermath of being gaslit.

I will just make a hot list for understanding of my M fiance's triggers -

\-me talking to men (he always even will slightly make some comment about flirtation)

\-me not wearing a bra ( i am an A cup not a DDD, and he has in the past made comments along the lines of - you are wearing that for attention you want people to look, you need to have attention in the room it's obvious if you are wearing that I mean you're not stupid. You know how you look, people are going to look.) LIKE I SHOULD LIVE MY LIFE IN FEAR OF PREDATORS AND JUDGMENT? \* mind you he met me in cut offs crop t shirt heeled cowboy boots and hammered...! makes me feel = insecure and hurt that he would say that.

\-me asking for an apology. ever. for anything.

Here is the tale of why I am here: picture it..

It's a Tuesday night. You have been working 12 hour days for the past 2 days. (You in the past 3 weeks had recently asked for a commission bump as you have generated around 115k in active jobs since feb of 2025 this year, and are denied. Same conversation you mention you are being held up on a 30k final commission payout for a project. Also denied. BUT you continue to keep trucking, and keep bringing in new work, and find yourself like i said, on the heels of a 2 day 12 hour shifter. All good though. Right?)Okay so back to Tuesday night! I am on like hour 18 of my period. I really am feeling it as I am attempting to lay down around 11pm with a heating pad. I get terrible periods, but this one was so bad I really thought I am going to say fuck it and wake up my fiance to take me to the ER. I was writhing in pain. I was worried I was being a nuisance in bed so I left the room for a little bit and actually cried from the pain. I think I was just letting other pain hang on the the period pain, but i think any female here will understand what I am saying. I felt terrible and emotional.

I smoke some weed and the midol I think is doing something by let's call it 1a? Well this is when my 14 y/o senior lab starts the whole inside / outside/ pant / move around night begins.

This happens somewhat regularly lately as it is his later stage in life. I was up with him until around 4:30 am, got him to rest finally, and then literally at 5:03 he was up again. I was so defeated. I just laid there in silent tear mode rolling down my cheek. I had to be up for a meeting @ 8a, and had another stacked day to follow.

In this moment my fiance wakes up and says "" babe, what's wrong with \_\_\_\_\_\_"" I know he meant no harm. It just felt like the equivalent to a man-splain because I have been up miserable all night and he FINALLY taps in to the dog situation. (i always handle alone, BUT he is technically mine, but still. you could be a gentleman and help...)

I snapped. ""do you think im an oracle? do you think i can read his mind?"" He is struggling I have been up with him all night im so exhausted, (tears are starting). I then finish off the night sleeping on the couch with his dogbed next to me so i can touch him because that seemed to be the only help.

I am laying there feeling so crummy, watching the sunrise through the curtains. I would cap this at roughly and hour + half of sleep total.

I would last time i had done that was my rowdy early 20s or late teens pulling a party all nighter.

My alarm goes off. I am making coffee like the zombie i am, fiance walks in the kitchen from our bedroom. I immediately apologized for snapping at him. I explained the period pain, along with the dog and my exhausting day prior; it was a recipe for a snap.

He responds with im sorry babe you don't feel well. But also managed to slip that he also didn't get any sleep.. (he was snoring while i stared at the ceiling for what felt like a painful eternity during the night so..)

LET'S FAST FORWARD TO THE MOMENT.

Wednesday afternoon, around 2p, fiance tells about a show that night and asks if i want to go. it's someone i like alot, and an artist he loves. It is at a historic venue down the road from my office, and honestly thought I had the energy to go after going in go-mode + coffee all day at work in the mix. I said yes let's do it. So he bought the tickets and they were about 200 bucks.

I want to re-iterate i was less than a mile from the venue, but decided I would go home and grab him and bring home dinner OTW from a nice spot since we needed to be there by 6:30 (what time he told me earlier)

I head to the house to snag him about 4:45pm, with dinner in tow. I sat in traffic for about 35 mins. i called him OTW and said hey I brought you a chx caesar salad from \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ since we don't have time to make dinner tonight before we go. He says thanks and i asked because he seemed nice but distracted (he was working on his car so he was in that brain), and he told me ""that's perfect. i'm easy.""

I get there, he is working on the car being nice. I walk in and put the food on the counter for him and start assessing the dog dinner sitch. He walks in and sees me feeding the dogs and says "" babe just go get changed ill feed the dogs""

So i go change and am touching up my face in the bathroom that faces the garage where he is still actively working on the car. i open the window and say ""babe i thought we needed to be there by 6:30, its already almost 6 and your greasy!"" He says ""yeah im almost done"" I then tap my toothpaste pod on the counter bc it is almost empty. he aggressively responded ""yeah i heard you im almost done"" I let him know um i was just tapping my toothpaste NOT whacking a gavel at you.

So i'm basically ready, I hear him feeding the dogs and get dressed. He then sits down on his phone scrolling reading and i have been in the other room lollygagging thinking i am waiting on him to finish.

I see him sitting and ask, hey did the dogs go out?

( he is posed as if he is waiting for me, like didn't say ""hey im ready"", just went and quietly sat down. he clearly has just been distracted with car stuff. but this is when he goes into that drone mode and forgets there is another person and responsibilities he is just sitting through..)

He responded to me head down in phone after a pause with a mean tone ""uh i dont know. have they?""

I immediately felt that cold ping to the chest of anxiety. I guess it just felt mean.

my response ""well i dont know if they did or didnt bc you told me to go get ready you'll take care of the dogs, and i did. Regardless they need to go potty before we leave""

he in a TONE scoffing like i am holding him up, ""okay.""

MOOD OFFICIALLY SET in my mind. He is being rude and i'm like don't bite this man brat's bait. We have already really had it this week and it's only wednesday.

We are in the car backing out of the driveway and he suggests in a tone ""so should we drive through \_\_\_\_\_burger place \_\_\_\_\_\_ since we don't have much time"" I said to him in an annoyed firm tone, ""i am totally good on that, you are more than welcome to eat that. I already ate, and like i said before I brought you dinner."" He is acting as if we didn't have this conversation. Which is something i mention often enough, which im sure he finds annoying. that i feel he really doesn't listen to me.

He with shrill tone well is it at the office, or? I say in the tone he is talking to me, it is in the FRIDGE where YOU put it after I brought it home."" He SNAPS AND IS YELLING AT ME- ""OKAY, IT'S IN THE FRIDGE"" throws MY car in drive and jams it back up the driveway aggressively.

(we are in my car he has no A/C right now, and bought a broken truck but blamed the dealers for ripping him off.. that's a whole other story )

I immediately unbuckle my seatbelt, and remove my bag and body from the passengers seat and say in a emotionally charged hurt firm tone ""I am NOT going anywhere with you, neither is my car without an apology for how you're speaking and treating me.""

him- ""you're such a b\*\_\_\_\_\_. fine I will get an uber.""

i. completely. am. shocked. hurt. sad. ANXIETY RUSHING to wreck my senses. heart is beating out of my chest. I can barely speak. I am shutting down into an anxiety attack and i am pathetically trying to catch my breathe to BEG for an apology before anything gets worse.

me asking for an apology, as per usual, made things much worse.

HIM (very impatient. mean defensive look on his face. holding his phone actively looking at the uber he ordered instead of being a MAN and apologizing for being mean. ""LOOK IM SORRY FOR CALLING YOU A B\*\_\_\_\_ BUT YOU'RE PISSING ME OFF""

I at this moment am having an anxiety attack begin. I could only breathe in not out, lost my vision on the edges, they were closing in like black spinning fans. My heart rate was so high i could feel it pumping in my neck. I was gyrating in all of my limbs and chin. my whole face was numb, especially my mouth. i couldnt close my hands.

My fiance bearing witness to this reaction to our altercation, chose to belittle me in this moment.

""look at you. you really are psycho. you are crazy dude. LOOK AT YOU. You are crazy. You need help. JUST CALM DOWN . You are out of control look how you're overreacting. you're scaring the dogs.""

following me from each safe place i find to give me a disgusted look to say all of these things. from my car to the bedroom to the guest bedroom.

I am pushing out ""please please i cant breathe I cant breathe I cant breathe"" and he says well im gonna go. You can calm down. the ubers gonna leave. ill hold it as long as possible""

i feel legitamately crazy / i don't even know how to process what im feeling.

he never cancelled the uber. He got in it.

i am so embarassed that i threw myself toward the front door like a maniac and screamed out front in a deep voice if you leave youll never speak to me again. it felt wrong and desperate and threatening. I really deeply hate that i did that.

He left went to the concert alone, and felt no remorse over the situation. In his brain I ruined the night.

Now he is only looking at my unhinged raw reaction. I gave him that.

He has never endured being in a relationship with someone with anxiety i believe. and it really made me realize this after this week.

I have had a breakdown after he has accused me of things early in our relationship that were unfounded and irrational, but I didn't know how to process the attacks so i would hide and retreat. he found me once and said ""what are you so upset about?"" I have never forgotten that. To give clarity, it is and was over him having major jealousy issues. He is seemingly the type of guy that attacks a girl if a guy hits on them saying we were encouraging it, etc.

""You are the kind of girl that likes the attention so it makes it okay for the guys. There are girls who arent and guys don't mess with them.""

Back to the fight. He is gone. I am feeling insane and cannot process my pain and texted him like a desperate idiot. I was begging and pleading for him to see how he just hurt me. and how an apology isnt real if you say you were called a b\*\_\_\_\_ bc you are pissing me off.

i let him know i am deeply struggling and think this fight has actually triggered a mental breakdown in me. pleading for support. from the person who hurt and dismissed me.

He goes on to tell me hes embarassed sitting at this expensive concert he spent money on alone. implying i am ungrateful and he is a victim. He continues to victimize himself. tell me it's ""hit a point"" I am off base. crazy. self-pitying. TOXIC. and my very favorite AN ABUSER.

it is now sunday. I apologized after he didn't speak a WORD to me for almost 48 hours and then actually had the audacity to say to me on my way to a hellish work day again SO ARE WE JUST NOT SPEAKING to eachother?

i said ball is in your court.

I sent him things i found online talking to chatgpt that seemed to anger him. He didn't care at all. mocked me even. He flipped my research on me to call me an abuser. and that he is not a narcissist in fact he's an empath.

i had told him i really am worried that you lack empathy with how you respond.

He is a person that doesn't believe in anxiety attacks, or worse, shames someone suffering like it's not worth his time.

ANYWAY i am now suffering with more anxiety after explaining myself and my hurt so many times that i apologized to him to make it go away.

He is now suffering swollen lymph node and a bunyun and just ""doesn't feel good"" ""all because of the stress i put him under"" he does this alot. When he does something mean, or I am hurting, somehow he is hurting now, or the victim in some way.

I literally have endometriosis, a broken collar bone, 4 slipped discs in my neck, and have chronic anxiety problems stemming from trauma. I keep this all to myself ALWAYS. because I don't ever want someone to think i am asking for pity.

It actually makes me feel sick. He today tried to sit me down to tell me about his youtube empathy video finding and used it against me to show that i am the problem that seems unwell and unfit.

saying if we have a child i think it's okay to just act this way and have blow ups.

COMPLETELY missing the part where he is a needler. he prods negatively in micro doses until its brought to his attention then it's always well YOU \_\_\_\_ and what about MY feelings? LITERALLY every. single. time. I EVER have anything to bring up.

i really feel gaslit and emotionally abused. We have agreed to therapy but he wont go see the one i found because he thinks he's getitng set up to be the bad guy.

toss in there too, he for the (cannot count how many times now because apparently he does it alot and thinks its normal HIS WORDS) has set our arlo outdoor camera hidden on me in the house during my panic attack. he set it up the next day as well and i found it again. I saw he did this randomly like a year ago too when i was just home alone and told him EMOTIONALLY that i found it really toxic and concerning and he laughed it off. again always invalidating my feelings like it's sport.

He blames all of his bad behavior on being abused by his dad. I never want to discredit anyone's trauma but i really believe he is exaggerating. He loves victimizing himself. It's a real pattern.

I opened up early on in our relationship about the severity of abuse i faced growing up. From physical to emotional to neglect. I would go without food school shelter and water at times under the hand of an unstable mother. It wasn't always terrible, but it made life hard to understand how things like this arent happening to everyone, and I became a huge people pleaser to ensure things would be okay. This is where my anxiety triggers come from because i feel immediately like this little girl again.

He has changed the stories about abuse growing up soooo many times depending on what it seems he has to compete with. That's how it feels. If he has to compete with the idea that he might be a jerk, here comes the how I was abused train and why i react the way i do.

I think his dad drank had an ego and over diciplined inappropriately. I genuinely hurt for my fiance that he went through this growing up. But also I think he had a bratty mouth and was spoiled growing up. i have heard that from his mom and sister. even dad. I know that doesn't mean he lied, but i see how he exaggerates things elsewhere that wouldnt have me suprised if he did here for his narrative.

I am truly leaving out so many awful comments and details that would probably make m or f sick to imagine.

thoughts welcome. I am happy to hear if i sound like the psycho in the above framing. I am just feeling crazy unloved and isolated. also like i am getting lost trying to sort my thoughts. but overall i am so confused and do not feel happy or good. Worried but hopeful there may be a solution that works.

First impression: there's a lot of negativity expressed about humanity in this religion.,"Various messages, be it song or sermon include:

""I was broken but you healed me.""

""We were sinful but you forgave me.""

""I was lost but you found me.""

""Marriage CAN'T work unless Jesus is at the center.""

""You can't be a good parent without Jesus at the center.""

""You can't do good in general without Jesus.""

""You can't find peace without Jesus.""

Basically, my subjective experience of the service is this: people suck, they are weak and hopeless without ""Jesus"".

In fairness, I LOVED a lot of what was said about service to one's partner, children and friends. I love that they emphasized selfless service is a key to building meaningful relationships and good works....I just don't understand why we can't do this without Jesus. I've experienced so much peace and love from non-Christians that it just came across as ignorant to claim Jesus is the only way.

The people were lovely. I asked the pastor afterwards to pray for my understanding, to open my heart and mind and see what y'all see. He and his wife were funny and kind, I'd come back.

1mz52yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousePowered/comments/1mz52yb/evaluate_the_best_countertop_ice_maker_by_black/,Evaluate the best countertop ice maker by Black and is it worth it,"Testing out the Ice Maker Countertop, known for producing nine ice cubes in just six minutes, was quite an adventure. The compact dimensions and sleek black finish made it an instant hit in my kitchen. I’ve always considered ice an essential part of beverages, and this machine delivered in surprising ways. I brought it home right before a family gathering, and the initial test run was an immediate success. Nobody had to wait for ice, and conversations about how quickly it worked kept the mood light throughout the evening.

**Compact Design and Portability**

This small powerhouse impressed me right out of the box. Its dimensions, roughly 9.3x11.6x11.4 inches, allowed it to sit comfortably on my kitchen countertop without stealing too much space. The built-in handle added a significant edge, making relocation to the backyard during a barbecue seamless. Whether it was parked in the kitchen, transported for an outdoor movie night, or even brought to a friend’s house, moving this ice maker around was almost effortless. Its portability amplified its versatility, and since space is at a premium in modern kitchens, I really appreciated the compact size.

**Performance and Rapid Ice Production**

The first time I used it, I started doubting the claim about the nine ice cubes being ready in six minutes. But to my surprise, the machine followed through. It was absolutely fascinating to watch those bullet-shaped cubes fall into the basket effortlessly every few minutes. The machine is capable of producing a whopping 26 pounds of ice daily—although I couldn’t imagine ever needing that much. However, during our weekend parties, it managed to keep up with the demand for mojitos, chilled sodas, and refreshing iced teas without any hiccups.

**Ice Cube Customization**

What caught me off guard was the option to choose between two sizes of ice cubes. My husband swore the larger cubes were perfect for his evening whiskey, melting slower and retaining the taste longer. On the other hand, I found the smaller cubes ideal for chilling juices and coffee without watering them down too quickly. The customization option felt thoughtful, almost as if the machine understood the user’s preferences. Kids, on the other hand, loved crunching on those small ice cubes straight from their lemonade.

**Self-Cleaning Convenience**

Maintenance often determines whether I continue using appliances or not, and thankfully this ice maker made cleaning as easy as flipping a switch. The self-cleaning function saved me from the dreaded task of manual scrubbing. By simply adding water and starting the cycle, the machine handled itself and ensured the ice remained fresh and hygienic. I always feel a sense of relief when repetitive chores are taken off my plate by intuitive features like this. All it needed afterward was a quick drain, and it was ready to go.

**Simple Operation and Quiet Functionality**

The intuitive touch control panel made using the machine straightforward. My teenage niece managed to figure it out faster than I did, adjusting the settings like a pro. What stood out even more was how quietly it operated. I’ve owned gadgets in the past that sounded like freight trains, so this calm and unobtrusive machine earned major points for not disrupting the ambiance when chilling with friends or hosting guests.

**Highlights**

- Compact size, perfect for countertops or tight spaces.
- Lightweight design and carry handle enhance portability.
- Offers two ice cube sizes for all beverage preferences.
- Self-cleaning function reduces maintenance efforts.
 
**Areas of Concern**

- Limited ice storage. The basket doesn’t hold extensive amounts, which means consistent emptying during prolonged use.
- While it works great at home, its capacity may not suffice for very large gatherings or commercial events.
- The absence of any visible water line hookup restricts continuous ice-making unless manually refilled.

**Competing Products**

In the realm of portable ice makers, I’ve also tested a few options from brands like GE and Frigidaire. While they do pack similar features—like rapid ice production—this machine has a subtle edge in terms of portability. GE’s machines can produce slightly more ice overall, but they sacrifice convenience due to their larger size. Frigidaire’s countertop models tend to be noisier during operation, which made my husband visibly happier with this quieter option. The compact design and thoughtful features distinguish it as user-friendly compared to some of its market competitors.

**Price Performance**

Assessing the cost-effectiveness of this machine was another highlight of reviewing it. Similar models from other brands often sit at par or slightly above its price range, but they lack details like dual-sized ice cubes or quiet functioning. Given its features and ease of use, the value it delivers is hard to ignore. Whether you’re looking for something functional for everyday use or portable enough for outdoor adventures, this ice maker feels worth every penny.

  The gate was packed with weary travelers, most of them standing and huddled along the walls because the meager allotment of plastic chairs had long since been taken. Every plane that came and went held at least eighty passengers, yet the gate had seats for only a few dozen.  
  
  There seemed to be a thousand waiting for the 7 P. M. flight to Miami. They were bundled up and heavily laden, and after fighting the traffic and the check-in and the mobs along the concourse they were subdued, as a whole. It was the Sunday after Thanksgiving, one of the busiest days of the year for air travel, and as they jostled and got pushed farther into the gate many asked themselves, not for the first time, why, exactly, they had chosen this day to fly.  
  
  The reasons were varied and irrelevant at the moment. Some tried to smile. Some tried to read, but the crush and the noise made it difficult. Others just stared at the floor and waited. Nearby a skinny black Santa Claus clanged an irksome bell and droned out holiday greetings.  
  
  A small family approached, and when they saw the gate number and the mob they stopped along the edge of the concourse and began their wait. The daughter was young and pretty. Her name was Blair, and she was obviously leaving. Her parents were not. The three gazed at the crowd, and they, too, at that moment, silently asked themselves why they had picked this day to travel.  
  
  The tears were over, at least most of them. Blair was twenty-three, fresh from graduate school with a handsome resume but not ready for a career. A friend from college was in Africa with the Peace Corps, and this had inspired Blair to dedicate the next two years to helping others. Her assignment was eastern Peru, where she would teach primitive little children how to read. She would live in a lean-to with no plumbing, no electricity, no phone, and she was anxious to begin her journey.  
  
  The flight would take her to Miami, then to Lima, then by bus for three days into the mountains, into another century. For the first time in her young and sheltered life, Blair would spend Christmas away from home. Her mother clutched her hand and tried to be strong.  
  
  The good - byes had all been said. ""Are you sure this is what you want?"" had been asked for the hundredth time.  
  
  Luther, her father, studied the mob with a scowl on his face. What madness,"" he said to himself. He had dropped them at the curb, then driven miles to park in a satellite lot. A packed shuttle bus had delivered him back to Departures, and from there he had elbowed his way with his wife and daughter down to this gate. He was sad that Blair was leaving, and he detested the swarming horde of people. He was in a foul mood. Things would get worse for Luther.  
  
  The harried gate agents came to life and the passengers inched forward. The first announcement was made, the one asking those who needed extra time and those in first class to come forward. The pushing and shoving rose to the next level.  
  
  ""I guess we'd better go,"" Luther said to his daughter, his only child.  
  
  They hugged again and fought back the tears. Blair smiled and said, ""The year will fly by. I'll be home next Christmas. ""  
  
  Nora, her mother, bit her lip and nodded and kissed her once more. ""Please be careful,"" she said because she couldn't stop saying it.  
  
  ""I'll be fine. ""  
  
  They released her and watched helplessly as she joined a long line and inched away, away from them, away from home and security and everything she'd ever known. As she handed over her boarding pass, Blair turned and smiled at them one last time.  
  
  ""Oh well,"" Luther said. ""Enough of this. She's going to be fine. ""  
  
  Nora could think of nothing to say as she watched her daughter disappear. They turned and fell in with the foot traffic, one long crowded march down the concourse, past the Santa Claus with the irksome bell, past the tiny shops packed with people.  
  
  It was raining when they left the terminal and found the line for the shuttle back to the satellite, and it was pouring when the shuttle sloshed its way through the lot and dropped them off, two hundred yards from their car. It cost Luther $7. 00 to free himself and his car from the greed of the airport authority.  
  
  When they were moving toward the city, Nora finally spoke. ""Will she be okay?"" she asked. He had heard that question so often that his response was an automatic grunt.  
  
  ""Sure. ""  
  
  ""Do you really think so?""  
  
  ""Sure. "" Whether he did or he didn't, what did it matter at this point? She was gone; they couldn't stop her.  
  
  He gripped the wheel with both hands and silently cursed the traffic slowing in front of him. He couldn't tell if his wife was crying or not. Luther wanted only to get home and dry off, sit by the fire, and read a magazine.  
  
  He was within two miles of home when she announced, ""I need a few things from the grocery. ""  
  
  ""It's raining,"" he said.  
  
  ""I still need them. ""  
  
  ""Can't it wait?""  
  
  ""You can stay in the car. Just take a minute. Go to Chip's. It's open today. ""  
  
  So he headed for Chip's, a place he despised not only for its outrageous prices and snooty staff but also for its impossible location. It was still raining of course she couldn't pick a Kroger where you could park and make a dash. No, she wanted Chip's, where you parked and hiked.  
  
  Only sometimes you couldn't park at all. The lot was full. The fire lanes were packed. He searched in vain for ten minutes before Nora said, ""Just drop me at the curb. "" She was frustrated at his inability to find a suitable spot.  
  
  He wheeled into a space near a burger joint and demanded, ""Give me a list. ""  
  
  ""I'll go,"" she said, but only in feigned protest. Luther would hike through the rain and they both knew it.  
  
  ""Gimme a list. ""  
  
  ""Just white chocolate and a pound of pistachios,"" she said, relieved.  
  
  ""That's all?""  
  
  ""Yes, and make sure it's Logan's chocolate, one-pound bar, and Lance Brothers pistachios. ""  
  
  ""And this couldn't wait?""  
  
  ""No, Luther, it cannot wait. I'm doing dessert for lunch tomorrow. If you don't want to go, then hush up and I'll go. ""  
  
  He slammed the door. His third step was into a shallow pothole. Cold water soaked his right ankle and oozed down quickly into his shoe. He froze for a second and caught his breath, then stepped away on his toes, trying desperately to spot other puddles while dodging traffic.  
  
  Chip's believed in high prices and modest rent. It was on a side alley, not visible from anywhere really. Next to it was a wine shop run by a European of some strain who claimed to be French but was rumored to be Hungarian. His English was awful but he'd learned the language of price gouging. Probably learned it from Chip's next door. In fact all the shops in the District, as it was known, strove to be discriminating.  
  
  And every shop was full. Another Santa clanged away with the same bell outside the cheese shop. ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer rattled from a hidden speaker above the sidewalk in front of Mother Earth, where the crunchy people were no doubt still wearing their sandals. Luther hated the store-refused to set foot inside. Nora bought organic herbs there, for what reason he'd never been certain. The old Mexican who owned the cigar store was happily stringing lights in his window, pipe stuck in the corner of his mouth, smoke drifting behind him, fake snow already sprayed on a fake tree.  
  
  There was a chance of real snow later in the night. The shoppers wasted no time as they hustled in and out of the stores. The sock on Luther's right foot was now frozen to his ankle.  
  
  There were no shopping baskets near the checkout at Chip's, and of course this was a bad sign. Luther didn't need one, but it meant the place was packed. The aisles were narrow and the inventory was laid out in such a way that nothing made sense. Regardless of what was on your list, you had to crisscross the place half a dozen times to finish up.  
  
  A stock boy was wo  
rking hard on a display of Christmas chocolates. A sign by the butcher demanded that all good customers order their Christmas turkeys immediately. New Christmas wines were in! And Christmas hams!  
  
  What a waste, Luther thought to himself. Why do we eat so much and drink so much in the celebration of the birth of Christ? He found the pistachios near the bread. Odd how that made sense at Chip's. The white chocolate was nowhere near the baking section, so Luther cursed under his breath and trudged along the aisles, looking at everything. He got bumped by a shopping cart. No apology, no one noticed. ""God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen"" was coming from above, as if Luther was supposed to be comforted. Might as well be ""Frosty the Snowman. ""  
  
  Two aisles over, next to a selection of rice from around the world, there was a shelf of baking chocolates. As he stepped closer, he recognized a one-pound bar of Logan's. Another step closer and it suddenly disappeared, snatched from his grasp by a harsh-looking woman who never saw him. The little space reserved for Logan's was empty, and in the next desperate moment Luther saw not another speck of white chocolate. Lots of dark and medium chips and such, but nothing white.  
  
  The express line was, of course, slower than the other two. Chip's outrageous prices forced its customers to buy in small quantities, but this had no effect whatsoever on the speed with which they came and went. Each item was lifted, inspected, and manually entered into the register by an unpleasant cashier. Sacking was hit or miss, though around Christmas the sackers came to life with smiles and enthusiasm and astounding recall of customers' names. It was the tipping season, yet another unseemly aspect of Christmas that Luther loathed.  
  
  Six bucks and change for a pound of pistachios. He shoved the eager young sacker away, and for a second thought he might have to strike him to keep his precious pistachios out of another bag. He stuffed them into the pocket of his overcoat and quickly left the store.  
  
  A crowd had stopped to watch the old Mexican decorate his cigar store window. He was plugging in little robots who trudged through the fake snow, and this delighted the crowd no end, Luther was forced to move off the curb, and in doing so he stepped just left instead of just right. His left foot sank into five inches of cold slush. He froze for a split second, sucking in lungfuls of cold air, cursing the old Mexican and his robots and his fans and the damned pistachios. He yanked his foot upward and slung dirty water on his pants leg, and standing at the curb, with two frozen feet and the bell clanging away and ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"" blaring from the loudspeaker and the sidewalk blocked by revelers, Luther began to hate Christmas.  
  
  The water had seeped into his toes by the time he reached his car. ""No white chocolate,"" he hissed at Nora as he crawled behind the wheel.  
  
  She was wiping her eyes.  
  
  ""What is it now?"" he demanded.  
  
  ""I just talked to Blair. ""  
  
  ""What? How? Is she all right?""  
  
  ""She called from the airplane. She's fine. "" Nora was biting her lip, trying to recover.  
  
  Exactly how much does it cost to phone home from thirty thousand feet? Luther wondered. He'd seen phones on planes. Any credit card'll do. Blair had one he'd given her, the type where the bills are sent to Mom and Dad. From a cell phone up there to a cell phone down here, probably at least ten bucks.  
  
  And for what? I'm fine, Mom. Haven't seen you in almost an hour. We all love each other. We'll all miss each other. Gotta go, Mom.  
  
  The engine was running though Luther didn't remember starting it.  
  
  ""You forgot the white chocolate?"" Nora asked, fully recovered.  
  
  ""No. I didn't forget it. They didn't have any. ""  
  
  ""Did you ask Rex?""  
  
  ""Who's Rex?""  
  
  ""The butcher. ""  
  
  ""No, Nora, for some reason I didn't think to ask the butcher if he had any white chocolate hidden among his chops and livers. ""  
  
  She yanked the door handle with all the frustration she could muster. ""I have to have it. Thanks for nothing. "" And she was gone.  
  
  I hope you step in frozen water, Luther grumbled to himself. He fumed and muttered other unpleasantries. He switched the heater vents to the floorboard to thaw his feet, then watched the large people come and go at the burger place. Traffic was stalled on the streets beyond.  
  
  How nice it would be to avoid Christmas, he began to think. A snap of the fingers and it's January 2. No tree, no shopping, no meaningless gifts, no tipping, no clutter and wrappings, no traffic and crowds, no fruitcakes, no liquor and hams that no one needed, no ""Rudolph"" and ""Frosty,"" no office party, no wasted money. His list grew long. He huddled over the wheel, smiling now, waiting for heat down below, dreaming pleasantly of escape.  
  
  She was back, with a small brown sack which she tossed beside him just carefully enough not to crack the chocolate while letting him know that she'd found it and he hadn't. ""Everybody knows you have to ask,"" she said sharply as she yanked at her shoulder harness.  
  
  ""Odd way of marketing,"" Luther mused, in reverse now. ""Hide it by the butcher, make it scarce, folks'll clamor for it. I'm sure they charge more if it's hidden. ""  
  
  ""Oh hush, Luther""  
  
  ""Are your feet wet?""  
  
  ""No. Yours?""  
  
  ""No. ""  
  
  ""Then why'd you ask?""  
  
  ""Just worried. ""  
  
  ""Do you think she'll be all right?""  
  
  ""She's on an airplane. You just talked to her. ""  
  
  ""I mean down there, in the jungle. ""  
  
  ""Stop worrying, okay? The Peace Corps wouldn't send her into a dangerous place. ""  
  
  ""It won't be the same. ""  
  
  ""What?""  
  
  ""Christmas. ""  
  
  It certainly will not, Luther almost said. Oddly, he was smiling as he worked his way through traffic.  
Chapter Two  
  
  With his feet toasty and besocked with heavy wool, Luther fell fast asleep and woke up even faster. Nora was roaming. She was in the bathroom flushing and flipping lights, then she left for the kitchen, where she fixed an herbal tea, then he heard her down the hall in Blair's room, no doubt staring at the walls and sniffling over where the years had gone. Then she was back in bed, rolling and jerking covers and trying her best to wake him. She wanted dialogue, a sounding board. She wanted Luther to assure her Blair was safe from the horrors of the Peruvian jungle.  
  
  But Luther was frozen, not flinching at any joint, breathing as heavily as possible because if the dialogue began again it would run for hours. He pretended to snore and that settled her down.  
  
  It was after eleven when she grew still. Luther was wild-eyed, and his feet were smoldering. When he was absolutely certain she was asleep, he eased from the bed, ripped off the heavy socks and tossed them into a corner, and tiptoed down the hall to the kitchen for a glass of water. Then a pot of decaf.  
  
  An hour later he was in his basement office, at his desk with files open, the computer humming, spreadsheets in the printer, an investigator searching for evidence. Luther was a tax accountant by trade, so his records were meticulous. The evidence piled up and he forgot about sleep.  
  
  A year earlier, the Luther Krank family had spent $6,100 on Christmas-$6,100!-$6,100 on decorations, lights, flowers, a new Frosty, and a Canadian spruce; $6,100 on hams, turkeys, pecans, cheese balls, and cookies no one ate; $6,100 on wines and liquors and cigars around the office; $6,100 on fruitcakes from the firemen and the rescue squad, and calendars from the police association; $6,100 on Luther for a cashmere sweater he secretly loathed and a sports jacket he'd worn twice and an ostrich skin wallet that was quite expensive and quite ugly and frankly he didn't like the feel of. On Nora for a dress she wore to the company's Christmas dinner and her own cashmere sweater, which had not been seen since she unwrapped it, and a designer scarf she loved, $6,100. On Blair $6,100 for an overcoat, gloves and boots, and a Walkman for her jogging, and, of course, the latest, slimmest cell phone on the market-$6,100 on lesser gifts for a select handful of distant relatives, most on Nora's side-$6,100 on Christmas cards from a stationer three doors down from Chip's, in the District, where all prices were double; $6,100 for the party, an annual Christmas Eve bash at the Krank home,  
  
  And what was left of it? Perhaps a useful item or two, but nothing much-$6,100!  
  
  With great relish Luther tallied the damage, as if it had been inflicted by someone else. All evidence was coming neatly together and making a very strong case,  
  
  He waffled a bit at the end, where he'd saved the charity numbers. Gifts to the church, to the toy drive, to the homeless shelter and the food bank. But he raced through the benevolence and came right back to the awful conclusion: $6,100 for Christmas. -  
  
  ""Nine percent of my adjusted gross,"" he said in disbelief. ""Six thousand, one hundred. Cash. All but six hundred nondeductible. ""  
  
  In his distress, he did something he rarely did. Luther reached for the bottle of cognac in his desk drawer, and knocked back a few drinks.  
  
  He slept from three to six, and roared to life during his shower. Nora wanted to fret over coffee and oatmeal, but Luther would have none of it. He read the paper, laughed at the comics, assured her twice that Blair was having a ball, then kissed her and raced away to the office, a  
  
  The travel agency was in the atrium of Luther's building. He walked by it at least twice each day, seldom glancing at the window displays of beaches and mountains and sailboats and pyramids. It was there for those lucky enough to travel. Luther had never stepped inside, never thought about it actually. Their vacation was five days at the beach, in a friend's condo, and with his workload they were lucky to get that.  
  
  He stole away just after ten. He used the stairs so he wouldn't have to explain anything, and darted through the door of Regency Travel. Biff was waiting for him.  
  
  Biff had a large flower in her hair and a waxy bronze tan, and she looked as if she'd just dropped by the shop for a few hours between beaches. Her comely smile stopped Luther cold, and her first words left him flabbergasted. ""You need a cruise,"" she said.  
  
  ""How'd you know?"" he managed to mumble. Her hand was out, grabbing his, shaking it, leading him to her long desk, where she placed him on one side while she perched herself on the other. Long bronze legs, Luther noted. Beach legs.  
  
  ""December is the best time of year for a cruise,"" she began, and Luther was already sold. The brochures came in a torrent. She unfolded them across her desk, under his dreamy eyes.  
  
  ""You work in the building?"" she asked, easing near the issue of money.  
  
  ""Wiley Beck, sixth floor,"" Luther said without removing his eyes from the floating palaces, the endless beaches.  
  
  ""Bail bondsmen?"" she said.  
  
  Luther flinched just a bit. ""No. Tax accountants. ""  
  
  ""Sorry,"" she said, kicking herself. The pale skin, the dark eye circles, the standard blue oxford-cloth button-down with bad imitation prep school tie. She should have known better. Oh well. She reached for even glossier brochures. ""Don't believe we get too many from your firm. ""  
  
  ""We don't do vacations very well. Lots of work. I like this one right here. ""  
  
  ""Great choice. ""  
  
  They settled on the Island Princess, a spanking-new mammoth vessel with rooms for three thousand, four pools, three casinos, nonstop food, eight stops in the Caribbean, and the list went on and on. Luther left with a stack of brochures and scurried back to his office six floors up.  
  
  The ambush was carefully planned. First, he worked late, which was certainly not unusual, but at any rate helped set the stage for the evening. He got lucky with the weather because it was still dreary. Hard to get in the spirit of the season when the skies were damp and gray. And much easier to dream about ten luxurious days in the sun.  
  
  If Nora wasn't worrying about Blair, then he'd certainly get her started. He'd simply mention some dreadful piece of news about a new virus or perhaps a Colombian village massacre, and that would set her off. Keep her mind off the joys of Christmas. Won't be the same without Blair, will it?  
  
  Why don't we take a break this year? Go hide. Go escape. Indulge ourselves.  
  
  Sure enough, Nora was off in the jungle. She hugged him and smiled and tried to hide the fact that she'd been crying. Her day had gone reasonably well. She'd survived the ladies' luncheon and spent two hours at the children's clinic, part of her grinding volunteer schedule.  
  
  While she heated up the pasta, he sneaked a reggae CD into the stereo, but didn't push Play. Timing was crucial.  
  
  They chatted about Blair, and not long into the dinner Nora kicked the door open. ""It'll be so different this Christmas, won't it, Luther?""  
  
  ""Yes it will,"" he said sadly, swallowing hard. ""Nothing'll be the same. ""  
  
  ""For the first time in twenty-three years, she won't be here. ""  
  
  ""It might even be depressing. Lots of depression at Christmas, you know. "" Luther quickly swallowed and his fork grew still.  
  
  ""I'd love to just forget about it,"" she said, her words ebbing at the end.  
  
  Luther flinched and cocked his good ear in her direction.  
  
  ""What is it?"" she asked.  
  
  ""Well!"" he said dramatically, shoving his plate forward. ""Now that you mention it. There's something I want to discuss with you. ""  
  
  ""Finish your pasta. ""  
  
  ""I'm finished,"" he announced, jumping to his feet. His briefcase was just a few steps away, and he attacked it.  
  
  ""Luther, what are you doing?""  
  
  ""Hang on. ""  
  
  He stood across the table from her, papers in both hands. ""Here's my idea,"" he said proudly. ""And it's brilliant. ""  
  
  ""Why am I nervous?""  
  
  He unfolded a spreadsheet, and began pointing. ""Here, my dear, is what we did last Christmas. Six thousand, one hundred dollars we spent on Christmas. Six thousand, one hundred dollars. ""  
  
  ""I heard y  
ou the first time. ""  
  
  ""And precious little to show for it. The vast majority of it down the drain. Wasted. And that, of course, does not include my time, your time, the traffic, stress, worry, bickering, ill-will, sleep loss-all the wonderful things that we pour into the holiday season. ""  
  
  ""Where is this going?""  
  
  ""Thanks for asking. "" Luther dropped the spreadsheets and, quick as a magician, presented the Island Princess to his wife. Brochures covered the table. ""Where is this going, my dear? It's going to the Caribbean. Ten days of total luxury on the Island Princess, the fanciest cruise ship in the world. The Bahamas, Jamaica, Grand Cayman, oops. , wait a minute, ""  
  
  Luther dashed into the den, hit the Play button, waited for the first notes, adjusted the volume, then dashed back to the kitchen where Nora was inspecting a brochure.  
  
  ""What's that?"" she asked.  
  
  ""Reggae, the stuff they listen to down there. Anyway, where was I?""  
  
  ""You were island hopping. ""  
  
  ""Right, we'll snorkel on Grand Cayman, windsurf in Jamaica, lie on the beaches. Ten days, Nora, ten fabulous days""  
  
  ""I'll have to lose some weight. ""  
  
  ""We'll both go on a diet. Whatta you say?""  
  
  ""What's the catch?""  
  
  ""The catch is simple. We don't do Christmas. We save the money, spend it on ourselves for once. Not a dime on food we won't eat or clothes we won't wear or gifts no one needs. Not one red cent. It's a boycott, Nora, a complete boycott of Christmas. ""  
  
  ""Sounds awful. ""  
  
  ""No, it's wonderful. And it's just for one year. Let's take a break. Blair's not here. She'll be back next year and we can jump back into the Christmas chaos, if that's what you want. Come on, Nora, please. We skip Christmas, save the money, and go splash in the Caribbean for ten days. ""  
  
  ""How much will it cost?""  
  
  ""Three thousand bucks. ""  
  
  ""So we save money?""  
  
  ""Absolutely. ""  
  
  ""When do we leave?""  
  
  ""High noon, Christmas Day. ""  
  
  They stared at each other for a long time.  
  
  The deal was closed in bed, with the television on but muted, with magazines scattered over the sheets, all unread, with the brochures not Far away on the night table. Luther was scanning a financial newspaper but seeing little. Nora had a paperback but the pages weren't turning.  
  
  The deal breaker had been their charitable giving. She simply refused to forgo it, or skip it, as Luther insisted on saying. She had reluctantly agreed to buy no gifts. She also wept at the thought of no tree, though Luther had mercilessly driven home the point that they yelled at each other every Christmas when they decorated the damned thing. And no Frosty on the roof? When every house on the street would have one? Which brought up the issue of public ridicule. Wouldn't they be scorned for ignoring Christmas?  
  
  So what, Luther had replied over and over. Their friends and neighbors might disapprove at first, but secretly they would burn with envy. Ten days in the Caribbean, Nora, he kept telling her. Their friends and neighbors won't be laughing when they're shoveling snow, will they? No jeers from the spectators when we're roasting in the sun and they're bloated on turkey and dressing. No smirks when we return thin and tanned and completely unafraid of going to the mailbox.  
  
  Nora had seldom seen him so determined. He methodically killed all her arguments, one by one, until nothing was left but their charitable giving.  
  
  ""You're going to let a lousy six hundred bucks stand between us and a Caribbean cruise?"" Luther asked with great sarcasm.  
  
  ""No, you are,"" she replied coolly.  
  
  And with that they went to their corners and tried to read.  
  
  But after a tense, silent hour, Luther kicked off the sheets and yanked off the wool socks and said, ""All right. Let's match last year's charitable gifts, but not a penny more. ""  
  
  She flung her paperback and went for his neck. They embraced, kissed, then she reached for the brochures.",1,1756063908.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I (18F) broke up with my bf (18M) after a month
or so and my mother (40s F) thinks i am TA. 
We met at a school-organised history conference, we both were presenting. He first said hi and complimented me on the presentation, i added him on ig and somehow we started dating. And we had issues: 
• He invited me on a date (coffee and walk) and made me pick the spot even though I expressed i would rather he picks 
• He didn't pay for said coffee (hear me out: i did not require him, like we barely knew each other, if he didn't want to spend on my coffee, fine, but also if he is comfortable enough to ask me out, he should at least suggest that I guess?. What he did instead was kind of awkwardly pushed me to order before him) 
• And once we became official, he didn't let me pay for anything because he doesnt want people spending money on him. Wrll i told him i am not comfortable with being paid for all the time and would appreciate if he let me once in a while. No, he pays. Felt controlling
• He bought me flowers, numerous times without an occassion, lovely, right? Well he developed a joke of how expensive i am and that he spends a lot on flowers (i told him he doesn't have to, eventually snaped and told him to stop saying that because i didn't ask for flowers)
• 18th bd is a big thing for where i am, i bought him a book, perfume and wrotr him a poem. He got the poem before his bd because i was on a trip the day of. Rest was gifted on his bd party, he fucking placed the gift on the floor and forgot about, didn't wear the perfume once (whatever, maybe not a right choice). Book was historical about his special intrest, didn't read it as far as i know
For my bd he got me a buquet (he asked, i told him my fav flowers were red roses, peonies, white and pink tulips) it was like the premade at a florist - not much thought into that, and blue - his fav colour! Additionally pearl necklace when i usually wear small, dainty gold neckleces. 
• He insists u wear blue (his fav) and like i show him a dress i want to buy (black/pink) he asks why not blue, he didnt wear black (my fav) once 
• Therr was also some sex stuff my tmi i guess (think like it made me so disguisted i distanced myself and kinda couldn't bring myself to even kiss him) not a fetish, but something he did 
• He is deeply religious, i am not at all 
• He said spanking children is fine, i don't want to do that. When i said i dont agree with him but we can discuss, he said i am allowed to a different opinion but we will not discuss it (was willing to change his mind on the topic when i told him i want to break up, partially over this)
But i admit, i was not perfect (think like dry messages after a moment of us being together, i was iritaed when he was texting me). He also told me that the moment we git together he stopped being suicidal and started having better self worth. And i told him ""i don't want to be too harsh, but i am not responsible for your happinness"".

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Humorous Prediction: Anastasia Potapova vs. Lin Zhu – US Open 2025**  
*By The Sportswriter Who Still Thinks a ""Let"" Is a Type of Sandwich*

**The Setup**  
Anastasia Potapova (WTA 44) faces Lin Zhu (WTA 303) in a first-round US Open clash that’s as lopsided as a tennis ball in a black hole. Potapova, a 23-year-old Russian with the ranking of a seasoned pro, takes on Zhu, a 31-year-old Chinese veteran whose ranking (303rd) is closer to the bottom of the barrel than the top. The odds? Let’s just say the bookmakers aren’t offering a “Zhu to win” prop bet because they’re saving the ink.

**The Stats**

* **Rankings**: Potapova (44) vs. Zhu (303). That’s a 259-spot gap. For context, that’s like comparing your morning coffee to decaf—both are technically caffeine, but one’s a *masterpiece*.
* **Head-to-Head**: None. They’ve never met. Ever. Not even in a dream. Not even in a *bad* dream.
* **Recent Form**: Zhu’s last victory? Let’s not dwell on that. Potapova’s last tournament? She’s fresh off a first-round exit in Cincinnati, where she lost to someone named Bouzas Maneiro. A name so Spanish it sounds like a *flamenco dancer’s* middle name.

**The Odds**

* **Moneyline**: Potapova is the undisputed favorite, with odds hovering around **1.5 to 1.56** (implied probability: \~64–66%). Zhu’s longshot odds (**2.4 to 2.6**) suggest you’d need a time machine to beli

* If Slack says `Away`, the script pokes it with random fake activity (every 30–120 sec)

“He wasn’t there? Then where are they keeping him…?”

“I don’t know, okay…”

Chelt sat down and took a sip of her coffee, in that '#1 Sister' Chelty had gifted her. “Well, I’d still love to know if anything else happened.”

Chelty looked at her with a smile, albeit an uneasy one. “Well… there was one other thing that happened.” Chelt looks up from her drink at this information, now interested.

“I… I had the chance to attack him. Or kill him, or incapacitate him, or… w-whatever.”

“You could’ve killed him?! You could’ve taken care of all of this?! And you didn’t take it?!”

1mz4zex,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1mz4zex/aio_may_25m_wife_25f_named_our_baby_after_her/,AIO May (25m) wife (25f) named our baby after her best friend,"Throwaway for the usual reasons. My wife (25f) and I (25m) have been together for 6 years, married for 2. We met our freshman year of college and she is truly my best friend and my person. Seriously, if soulmates exist, she is mine. We have an amazing relationship and are generally very communicative, and I think that’s a big part of why the misfire in communication here is getting to me.

Towards the end of last year, we found out she was pregnant. We were both truly over the moon and so excited to start our family together. We decided on names using the “2 yes 1 no” rule until we settled on something we both loved. For the middle name, we settled on a pretty gender neutral astronomy name. That’s the class where we met, and we wanted it to fit the name regardless of the baby’s sex.

Around 2-3 weeks ago (I swear I know her birthday, but newborns are exhausting and time is fake), we welcomed our baby girl. Wife was exhausted and ecstatic. I was too (although I don’t claim to know the exhaustion of labor lol). Anyway, things went great and we filled out the birth certificate with the name we chose. Things got weird when my wife’s best friend came to visit us at the hospital.

For context, my wife has known this best friend, E, since they were in middle school. They were incredibly close all the way up until high school, then parted ways for college, but they talk frequently and meet up for coffee or lunch or what have you when they’re both home. I’ve met him and his husband a bunch of times. They’re great guys, and I’ve always been grateful my wife has these people in her corner.

So E comes to the hospital to visit my wife and meet the baby. She hands him our daughter and says “her name is Firstname Middlename Lastname.” E started getting teary and asked “her middle name is Middlename?” My wife was also getting teary. I am confused and say something like “it’s beautiful, isn’t it?”

Come to find out, apparently the middle name we gave our daughter was E’s nickname from my wife in high school, and it was even his contact name in her phone for years. I had no idea as it was before we met.

I decided not to bring it up immediately so my wife could recover in peace, but I asked her about it when we got home a few days later. I’m paraphrasing, but I told her I love her and our daughter, and while I wasn’t exactly mad, I thought we chose the middle name to honor the two of us and how we met, not her friend. If I had known we were paying homage to someone else, I might’ve had different opinions or suggestions. This seemed like a big detail to leave out and I was kinda miffed she a) didn’t mention it to begin with and b) let me go on thinking the name had a different meaning than it did for so long.

She looked horrified and said she swore up and down she thought I knew the significance of the name. She thought it had come up in conversations about and/or with E, or that I’d seen that as his contact name in her phone before. I definitely could have when we first met years ago, but she must’ve changed it pretty early on because his contact name has been the same (different) nickname for as long as I can remember. We had both been pitching astronomy names because of our relationship, and she said when I pitched the name we chose, she thought I had chosen it because of its history with E. She didn’t mean to hide it from me, and if she’d known about the miscommunication, she would’ve corrected it. She seemed panicked about what to do, thinking I wanted to change the name.

I figured this still wasn’t the best time to talk about it, and so reassured her that I loved the name and her, and we could come back to this another time after she had recovered further. It’s been a few weeks since then and things have been good, but it’s been in the back of my mind. I do love my wife, and I believe her when she says she would’ve said something if she’d known, but I can’t help but feel lied to. I really thought the name was honoring us and our relationship, and it turned out to not involve me at all, or at the very least, it involved an extra person in a way that was unknown to me until it was too late. Am I overreacting here? Should I ask to change her middle name? Do I need to suck it up? I still love the name and my wife and child, but I was thrilled that we were able to have the start of our family honor where it all began, and now it just doesn’t feel the same.",5,1756063741.0,AmIOverreacting,12,0.86,False
1mz4z1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1mz4z1g/trip_report_first_time_in_nyc_for_35_days/,Trip Report: First time in NYC for 3.5 days,"Hi all, I just went to NYC for the first time ever. It was also my first solo vacation, and was an absolute blast! The reason I came this week was to attend an auction of LGBTQ+ Artwork, Material Culture, and History artifacts. As a note, I focused my trip on history and queer culture since those are my interests!

Day 1 (Wednesday): Flight in from S.F. landed at JFK around 5:30 PM. Ride share was $130 so I immediately decided to use the Airtrain/subway lol. Very easy and well designed connection from the airport to downtown tbh, I would never consider ride share again when at JFK.

I arrived at my hotel (Standard, High Line) around 7:30 PM. I didn’t eat lunch and knew I was having a late fancy dinner that wouldn’t fill me up, so I walked through the West Village to L’Industrie to grab a slice of pizza. Seriously the best pizza of any kind I’ve ever had, 11/10.

Dashed back to the hotel, changed into a suit, and took the subway to Le Bernardine for a 10:15 PM reservation. I did the chefs tasting menu, and it was both the best French and the best seafood restaurant I’ve been to!

Walked to Times Square since it was close, took the obligatory photos, and hopped back on the subway back to my hotel.

Day 2 (Thursday): Woke up and walked across the West Village to Murray’s to get a bagel. I got an onion bagel with chive cream cheese and lox. Very tasty bagel! I then walked to the auction house, registered, and got a paddle. After realizing they wouldn’t get to my lots for several hours, I dropped off my paddle and went to get some coffee.

I took the subway to Midtown near Grand Central Station, got some coffee, and then just walked around Midtown enjoying the architecture and taking photos. I got back to the auction with about 20 minutes to spare, bid on (and won!) the items I was interested in, and then left. Side note: thank god the billionaires were mostly bidding on the artwork and not the niche political history stuff I wanted, I would have been screwed otherwise lol.

Took the subway to the Met, and explored the Greek and Roman section, the Byzantine and Medieval section, the Arms and Armor section, and the Islamic, Turkish, Persian, and Near East section. Easily the best historical museum I have ever been to, it wasn’t even close. I could have spent 2 days here by itself.

I got kicked out when the Met closed, so I walked down through Central Park to the circle at the southwest corner of the park, walked two blocks west to a Halal Food cart with good reviews, and got an amazing chicken over rice. I’m lowkey so jealous of the cheap food options in NYC as an SF resident 😭. The amount, variety, and quality of food meals for $10 or less that are also two meals is truly astounding.

I then took a subway ride to Brooklyn to meet up with two cousins who are also gay at Exely and catch up with them. Walked down to the waterfront in Brooklyn with them, said goodbye, and then went to Westlight for drinks. What a great view!

I then got a Lyft to Dumbo (why no subway between dense parts of Queens and Brooklyn along east river facing Manhattan, that seems like a no brainer), got the obligatory Dumbo picture, and walked down to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade to get some more pictures.

Ended the day taking the subway back and crashing into bed exhausted.

Day 3 (Friday): Woke up and rushed to my Tenement Museum apartment tour at 10:15. Managed to snag an iced coffee and down it quickly before the tour started. We did the tour about two families under one roof (one Russian Jewish family, one Sicilian Catholic family), and I really enjoyed it. I’m interested in the history of US left wing urban politics, so the first families ownership of Jewish Daily Forward newspapers and participation in protests against the Triangle Shirtwaist fire was really cool!

Walked to Katz Deli and got a Reuban sandwich. I heard their mustard was good, so I subbed the thousand island for mustard. Omg, definitely the best pastrami I’ve ever had. Would go back for sure.

Took the subway back to the West Village, and toured major LGBTQ sites. I went to the Stonewall National Memorial, which was a very moving experience for me, I was legit almost in tears at some points. Afterwards, I got one drink in the restored bar just to say I did. I then took the bus to Christopher Street Pier to see it and get pictures of the skyline. Finally, I took the bus/subway to pay for my auction items and pick them up, and then went back to my hotel to change.

I had a reservation at 5:30 PM for bom, so I went there on the subway. This restaurant blew me away, I honestly thought the service and food were on par or slightly better than Le Bernardine, despite having two less stars. Definitely both the best Korean and best steak restaurant I’ve been to. Also a welcome reprieve from the the Korean food in SF generally (used to live in LA, Korean food is much better there).

Once that was done, I went back to my hotel to shower and get ready/relax a bit. I then headed to the Cock in the East Village to go clubbing, and had a great time! Collapsed back into bed around 2:30 AM, poor decision to be out this late lol.

Day 4 (Saturday): Woke up at 8:30 AM, way too late, and quickly changed/lightly freshened up. I was out of time for my Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island tour, so I took a Lyft. I got a bacon egg and cheese on a roll for breakfast from a cart near Battery Park, then got through security for the ferry ride. Walked around the Statue of Liberty taking photos, and went to the museum. My favorite part of this island was the poem from the bottom of the statue now located in the museum.

Took the ferry to Ellis Island and walked through the exhibits. I really enjoyed this, it was both very somber, hopeful, and  informative. I then went to the Hard Hat tour of the Infectious Diseases ward. I foolishly thought I could get on a ferry right at 1 PM if the tour ended then, but the front desk was kind enough to come get me early and escort me out so that I could make the 12:55 ferry and reach my Broadway play at 2 PM on time. Great tour, would highly recommend.

I then took the subway to Broadway and attended Cabaret. Billy Porter was out so the emcee was Marty Lauter. They were absolutely stunning tbh, they were so good I’m surprised they didn’t get their own run as the main Emcee, and Marisha Wallace was also amazing as well. It was my first Broadway musical and was absolutely amazing, extremely haunting, and very timely.

Side note: I struggled on which production to see. My main criteria were that I wanted it to be really queer and have a plot that seemed interesting to me, but I didn’t see much when looking a few months ago other than Cabaret. Having not seen Cabaret before but knowing the setting, I figured there was no way they could get away with making a play about an underground burlesque night club in Weimar Berlin without it being gay as hell, and I was definitely not wrong lol.

After the play, I walked through Times Square again, just because it was in between the show and my dinner spot, Xians Famous Foods. I got the spicy cumin lamb noodles and they were very tasty! Maybe slightly too little heat, but the flavor was excellent!

I took the subway back to the hotel to clean up, get ready, and change, then walked along the high line to get some pics. I got off and walked around Chelsea, getting a drink at Gym Sportsbar, since the club I was going to wasn’t open yet. Afterwards I walked to the NY Eagle and had a great time clubbing! I got a Lyft back to the hotel since the subway was a good walk and my feet were killing me by this point, and went to bed around 3:30 AM.

Day 5 (Today):

Woke up, cleaned up, packed, and left my hotel. I stopped at a diner to get a light breakfast of some rice pudding and coffee, and then took the subway/airtrain to the airport, before flying back to S.F.

Final thoughts:

Subway: I loved it! The coverage is so much better than S.F. 😭. I live in the Castro/Mission Dolores, so I’m in the best part of the city for subway line access, but it’s basically one straight line along market street. Y’all in NY have what we have in terms of frequency/reliability on one street for 3 miles, but it’s on basically all the subway lines in Manhattan/downtown Brooklyn. Also it runs 24/7 instead of stopping at midnight. So very jealous.
Side note: why the hell is it so hot in the subway.

Density: I love big city urbanism, and NY blew me away! Nowhere in the US has ever reminded me of Tokyo before, but NY definitely did. Admittedly, Tokyo is more like the West Village/Chelsea sprawled out for every direction in 50 miles instead of the super tall skyscrapers in Midtown/Downtown, but still. The sense of awe walking down a block and seeing yet another row of skyscrapers in every direction in Manhattan was magical. It was also really cool hearing a chorus of languages from all over the world, ones I had never heard before, just walking on the streets as well.

Gay life: Your bars were way more popping on a random Friday/Saturday night than ours are. The Cock/the Eagle were easily 2-3x as crowded as our equivalents are unless there is a major event (Powerhouse and also the Eagle lol), which made for a lot of fun!
One thing that was noticeable was that outside of the bars us gays were less dominant. Walking in the Castro where I live, we are legitimately an absolute majority of the people on the street. While there were lots of gays all around NYC, it never felt like we were the majority outside of the bars/their immediate block.

Review: 11/10, I love big dense cities with lots of gays, cultural activities/good food, and great public transit. Confirmed in my mind that NYC is one of the three places in the US I would live, along with SF and Chicago.

A lot more than you’d expect — if you’ve ever peeled open a packet of instant coffee, you're sipping on a story that loops through war zones, failed empires, and a race to bottle speed.

Instant coffee feels like an invention of the TikTok age — quick, efficient, and mess-free. But the first drinkable prototype was actually whipped up in 1890 by a man named David Strang in New Zealand. That’s right: the land of sheep and hobbits also quietly birthed the concept of powdered coffee. Strang created a method to dehydrate brewed coffee into granules, which could be reconstituted with hot water. His invention didn’t exactly take over — likely because people still had time and taste buds.

Fast forward to 1901, and a Japanese scientist named Satori Kato in Chicago patented what he claimed was the “first” instant coffee. The truth? He mostly refined Strang’s concept. But it was World War I — and later, WWII — that gave the drink a military-grade boost. Soldiers needed caffeine, not campfires.

Then came 1938. Nestlé, scrambling to help Brazil manage a brewing surplus of coffee beans, developed Nescafé using a new technique: they infused carbohydrates into soluble coffee to make it more stable and tasty. Cue mass distribution, global adoption, and, oddly enough, the rise of a certain Norweigan chemist, Alf Bjercke, who figured out how to make the milk and sugar instant too.

Today, instant coffee fuels students, office workers, and astronauts — yes, it’s been to space.

I've started to build an app for certain situations when you'd like to approach a woman but the timing could never be right.   
 I need to start with the back story. There has been 3 times I've had success with approaching a woman, no words were spoken and I have left with her number or Instagram.   
I was on a plane once, sitting in an aisle seat. The flight attendant was very attractive and we locked eyes a few times.  I just was too curious about her. How could I ask her out? She was working, there was a ton of people, the whole thing would be embarrassing if I said anything. So I put my Notes app in large font mode and I just wrote: I just want to say I think you're gorgeous but there's too many people here to tell you. How can I meet you?  
As she was walking toward the back, I stuck my phone out onto the aisle, she glanced at it and looked away. But then she looked again and read it. She took my phone and wrote on the Notes app: 'Come to the back.'  
I waited a few minutes and walked to the back where I apologized and we chatted for a bit. She gave me a free wine and I got her number but we didn't live in the same city so nothing ever happened.  
The second time, I was at the checkout line at a Zara store. Again, a very attractive woman at the counter. I was the 3rd person in line so I jumped on the notes app again and just wrote: Wow, you're beautiful but I don't want to cause a scene. How can I meet you? When I got to checkout, I put my phone down in front of her so she could read it. She smiled, picked it up and put in her IG. I bought the clothes, said thank you and left. We ended up seeing each other for about 6 months and it was an incredible mini relationship.  
Last story, sorry if this is too long. I was at the gym. Yes, I know never approach a girl at the gym. I never do. But. Well butt. There was a woman filming herself doing a glute workout, she was definitely a pro or someone who frequents the gym a lot. She was wearing headphones, I was wearing headphones. Pretty impossible to strike up a conversation. So I wrote on my Notes app - Where can I watch the video? I need to work on my glutes :)  
I walked over, made eye contact and stuck my phone out. Boom, she read it, smiled, grabbed my phone and put her IG. I just nodded and smiled and walked away. I never contacted her though, I think I thought she was probably out of my league.

So from these experiences, I've wanted to build an app  where you can write something, a question, a comment, a cheesy pickup line, whatever makes sense in the moment, and hand your phone to a woman (or a man or whatever gender(s) you like) and she can sort of play a game. She can swipe right if interested, swipe left and its game over, not interesed. You can create as many cards as you like - with photos, info about you or just a few comments or questions. The end card has a place for the woman to leave her number or touch a button that says - thanks but I'm not interested. It could work for couples too - to be a little flirty in a public place. A naughty note to swipe right on, etc.  
 I have some already made up cards for 'In the coffee shop' 'At the park' for people that aren't too creative. Some horrible chatGPT pickup lines that I need to improve. But I think the custom cards keep it more original.  
Ladies, if someone approached you, with a sweet message that you could read on their phone at a busy place, would you play along? In a grocery store? Train/Subway station? Could it at least be an ice breaker to talk to each other? I appreciate your feedback and any additional ideas! ",1,1756063576.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

  “I NEED YOU, JANE. ”  
  
  Frowning, Jane Parker placed the note on her kitchen countertop. She studied the scarred, leather-bound book resting inside an unadorned box, surrounded by a sea of black velvet. A few minutes ago, she’d returned from her five-mile jog. This package had been waiting on her porch.  
  
  There’d been no return address. No explanation as to why the thing had been left for her, and no hint as to who “I” was. Or why Jane was needed. Why would anyone need her? She was twenty-seven years old and had only recently regained the use of her legs. She had no family, no friends, no job. Not anymore. Her little cabin in Smallest Town Ever, Oklahoma, was secluded, barely a blip in the neighboring expanse of lush green trees and wide-open, blue sky.  
  
  She should have tossed the thing. Of course, curiosity far outweighed caution. As always.  
  
  She carefully lifted the book. At the moment of contact, she saw her hands covered in blood and gasped, dropping the heavy tome on the counter. But when she lifted her hands to the light, they were scrubbed clean, her nails neat and painted a pretty morning rose.  
  
  You have an overactive imagination, and too much oxygen pumping through your veins from the run. That’s all.  
  
  Cold hard logic—her best and only friend.  
  
  The book’s binding creaked as she opened to the middle, where a tattered pink ribbon rested. The scent of dust and musk wafted up, layered with something else. Something…mouthwatering and slightly familiar. Her frowned deepened.  
  
  She shifted in her seat, a twinge of pain shooting through her legs, and sniffed. Oh, yes. Her mouth definitely watered as she caught the slightest trace of sandalwood. Goose bumps broke out over her skin, her senses tingling, her blood heating. How embarrassing. And, okay, how interesting. Since the car accident that ruined her life eleven months ago, she had experienced arousal only at night, in her dreams. To react like this in daylight, because of a book…odd.  
  
  She didn’t allow herself to ponder why. There wasn’t an answer that would satisfy her. Instead, she concentrated on the pages in front of her. They were yellowed and brittle, delicate. And beaded with blood? Small dots of dried crimson marred the edges.  
  
  Gently she brushed her fingertips along the handwritten text, her gaze catching on several words. Chains. Vampire. Belonged. Soul. More goose bumps, more tingling.  
  
  Some blushing.  
  
  Her eyes narrowed. At last the sandalwood cologne made sense. For the past few months, she’d dreamed of a vampire male in chains and woken to the fragrance clinging to her skin. And yes, he’s the one who had aroused her. She’d told no one. So, how had anyone known to give her this…journal?  
  
  She’d worked in quantum physics for years, as well as what was considered fringe science, sometimes studying creatures of “myth” and “legend. ” She’d conducted controlled interviews with actual blood drinkers and even dissected the corpses brought to her lab.  
  
  She knew that vampires, shape-shifters and other creatures of the night existed, even though her coworkers on the quantum physics side of the equation had not been privy to the truth. So, maybe someone had found out and this was a simple joke. Maybe her dreams had no connection. Except, forever had seemed to pass since she’d had any contact with those coworkers. And besides, who would do such a thing? None of them had cared enough about her to do anything.  
  
  Let this go, Parker. Before it’s too late.  
  
  The command from her self-preservation instincts made no sense. Too late for what?  
  
  Her instincts offered no reply. Well, the scientist in her needed to know what was going on.  
  
  Jane cleared her throat. “I’m reading a few passages, and that’s that. ” She’d been alone since leaving the hospital several months ago, and sometimes the sound of her voice was better than silence. “‘Chains circled the vampire’s neck, wrists and ankles. Because his shirt and pants had been stripped away, and a loincloth was his only apparel, there was nothing to protect his already savaged skin. The links cut him deeply, to the bone, before healing—and slicing open again. He did not care. What was pain when your will, your very soul, no longer belonged to you?’”  
  
  She pressed her lips together as a wave of dizziness crashed through her. A moment passed, then another, her heartbeat speeding up and hammering wildly against her ribs.  
  
  Raw images tore through her. This man—this vampire—bound, helpless. Hungry. His lush lips were pulled taut, his teeth sharp, white. He was surprisingly tanned, temptingly muscled, with dark, mussed hair and a face so eerily beautiful he would haunt her nighttime fantasies for years to come.  
  
  What she’d just read, she’d already seen. Many times. How? She didn’t know. What she did know was that in her dreams, she felt compassion for this man, even anger. And yet, there was always that low simmer of arousal in the background. Now, the arousal took center stage.  
  
  The more she breathed, the more the sandalwood scent clung to her, and the more her reality altered, as if this, her home, was nothing more than a mirage. As if the vampire’s cage was real. As if she needed to stand up and walk—no, run—until she reached him. Anything to be with him, now and forever.  
  
  Okay. Enough of that. She slapped the book closed, even though so many questions were left dangling, and strode away.  
  
  Such a strong reaction coupled with her dreams utterly nixed the idea  
of a joke. Not that she’d placed much hope in that direction. However, the remaining possibilities upset her, and she refused to contemplate them.  
  
  She showered, dressed in a T-shirt and jeans and ate a nutritious breakfast. Unbidden, she found her gaze returning to the leather binding, over and over again. She wondered if the enslaved vampire were real—and okay. If she could help him. A few times, she even opened to the middle of the book before she realized she’d moved. Always she darted off before the story could snare her. And perhaps that’s why the stupid thing had been given to her. To hook her, to send her racing back to work. Well, she didn’t need to work. Money was not a problem for her. More than that, she no longer loved the sciences. Why would she? There was never a solution, only more problems.  
  
  Because when one puzzle piece slid into place, there were always twenty more needed. And in the end, nothing you did, nothing that had been solved or unraveled, would save the ones you loved. There would always be some dumb guy throwing back a few cold ones at the local bar, getting into his car and hitting yours. Or something equally tragic.  
  
  Life was random.  
  
  Jane craved monotony.  
  
  But when midnight rolled around, her mind still hadn’t settled in regards to the vampire. Giving up, she returned to the kitchen, grabbed the book and stalked to bed. Just a few more passages, damn it, then she’d start craving monotony again.  
  
  Jane’s oversize T-shirt bunched at her waist as she propped the book on her upraised legs, opened to the middle of the story, where the bookmark was still set, and returned her attention to the pages. For several seconds, the words appeared to be written in a language she did not understand. Then, a blink later, they were written in English again.  
  
  O-kay. Very weird, and surely—hopefully—an I-just-need-sleep mistake on her part.  
  
  She found her place. “‘They called him Nicolai. ’” Nicolai. A strong, luscious name. The syllables rolled through her mind, a caress. Her nipples beaded, aching for a hot, wet kiss, and every inch of her skin flushed. She thought back. She’d never interviewed a vampire named Nicolai, and the one in her dream had never spoken to her. He had never acknowledged her in any way. “‘He did not know his past or if he had a future. He knew only his present. His hated, torturous present. He was a slave, locked away like an animal. ’”  
  
  Just like before, a wave of dizziness slammed through her. This time, Jane pressed on, even as her chest constricted. “‘He was kept clean and oiled. Always. Just in case Princess Laila had need of him in her bed. And the princess did have need of him. Often. Her cruel, twisted desires left him beaten and bruised. Not that he ever accepted defeat. The man was wild, nearly uncontrollable, and so filled with hate anyone who looked at him saw their death in his eyes. ’”  
 The dizziness intensified. Hell, so did the desire. To tame a man like that, to have all of his vigor focused on you, pounding into you…his participation willing… Jane shivered.  
  
  Lose the ADD, Parker. She cleared her throat. “‘He was hard, merciless. A warrior at heart. A man used to absolute control. At least, he thought he was. Even with his lack of memory, he was patently aware that every order directed his way scraped his nerves raw. ’”  
  
  Another shiver rocked her. She grit her teeth. He needed her compassion, not her desire. He’s that real to you? Yeah, he was. “‘At least he would have a few days’ reprieve,’” she read on, “‘forgotten by one and all. The entire palace was frothing over Princess Odette’s return from the grave and—’”  
  
  The rest of the page was blank. “And what?” Jane flipped to the next, but quickly realized the story had ended on an unfinished cliff-hanger. Great.  
  
  Thankfully—or not—she discovered more writing toward the end and blinked, shook her head. The words didn’t change. “‘You, Jane Parker,’” she recited hollowly. “‘You are Odette. Come to me, I command you. Save me, I beg you. Please, Jane. I need you. ’”  
  
  Her name was in the book. How was her name in the book? And written by the same hand as the rest? On the same aged, stained pages, with the same smudged ink?  
  
  I need you.  
  
  Her attention returned to the part directed to her. She reread “You are Odette” until the urge to scream was at last overshadowed by curiosity. Her mind swirled. There were so many paths to take with this. Forged, genuine, dream, reality.  
  
  Come to me.  
  
  Save me.  
  
  Please.  
  
  I command you.  
  
  Something inside her responded to that command more than anything else in the book. The urge to run—here, there, anywhere—beat through her. As long as she found him, saved him, nothing else mattered. And she could save him, just as soon as she reached him.  
  
  I. Command. You.  
  
  Yes. She wanted to obey. So damn badly. She felt as if an invisible cord had been wound around her neck, and was now tugging at her.  
  
  Trembling, Jane closed the book. She wasn’t searching for anyone. Not tonight. She needed to regroup. In the morning, after a few coffee IVs, her head would be clear and she could reason this out. She hoped.  
  
  After placing the tome on her nightstand, she flopped into her bed and closed her eyes, trying to force her brain to quiet. An unsuccessful endeavor. If Nicolai’s story was true, he was as trapped by those chains as surely as she had once been trapped by her body’s infirmities.  
  
  The compassion grew…spread…  
  
  While he was kept in a cage, she had been bound to a hospital bed, her bones broken, her muscles torn, her mind hazed by medication, all because a drunk driver had slammed into her car. And while she had been—was—tormented by the loss of her family, since her mother, father and sister had been in the car with her, Nicolai was tormented by a sadistic woman’s unwanted touch. She felt a wave of regret, a crackle of fury.  
  
  I need you.  
  
  Jane inhaled deeply, exhaled slowly and shifted to her side, clutching her pillow close. As close as she suddenly wanted to clutch Nicolai, to comfort him. To be with him. Uh, not going there. She didn’t know the man. Therefore, she wasn’t going to imagine sleeping with him.  
  
  But that’s exactly what she did. His plight was forgotten as she imagined him climbing on top of her, his silver eyes bright with desire, his pupils blown. His lips were plump and red from kissing her entire body, still moist with her flavor. She licked at him, tasting him, tasting herself, eager for anything and everything he would give her.  
  
  He growled his approval, flashing his fangs.  
  
  His big, muscled body surrounded her, his skin hot, little beads of sweat forming, causing them to rub and glide together, straining toward release. God, he felt good. So damn good. Long and thick. A perfect fit, stretching her just right. Rocking, rocking, faster and faster, taking her to the edge of sensation before slowing…slowing…tormenting.  
  
  She clawed at him, her nails scouring his back. He groaned. She raised her knees, squeezing his hips. Yes. Yes, more. Faster, faster still. Never enough, almost enough. More, please more.  
  
  Nicolai’s tongue thrust into her mouth, rolling with hers before he bit down, drawing blood, sucking. A sharp sting, and then, finally, oh, God, finally, she tumbled over.  
  
  Ripples of satisfaction swept through her entire body, little stars winking behind her eyes. Her inner muscles clenched and unclenched, liquid heat pooling between her legs. She rode the tide for endless seconds, minutes, before sagging against the mattress, boneless, unable to catch her breath.  
  
  An orgasm, she mused dazedly. A freaking orgasm from a fantasy man, and she hadn’t even needed to touch herself.  
  
  “Nicolai…mine…” she whispered, and she was smiling as she at last drifted off to sleep.  
  
  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  “PRINCESS. PRINCESS, you must wake up. ”  
  
  Jane blinked open her eyes. Muted sunlight pushed into the bedroom—an unfamiliar bedroom, she realized with confusion. Her room was plain, with white walls and brown carpet, the only furniture an unadorned bed. Now, a lacy pink canopy was draped overhead. To her right was an intricately carved nightstand, a bejeweled goblet perched on top. Beyond that, a plush, glittery carpet led to arched double doors framing a spacious closet bursting with a rainbow of velvets, satins and silks.  
  
  This wasn’t right.  
  
  She jolted upright. Dizziness hit her—familiar, but not comforting—and she moaned.  
  
  “Are you all right, princess?”  
  
  She forced herself to focus and take stock. A girl stood beside her bed. A girl she had never encountered before. Short, plump, with a freckled nose and frizzy red hair, wearing a coarse brown dress that appeared uncomfortably snug.  
  
  Jane scrambled backward, hitting the headboard. “Who are you? What are you doing here?” Even as she spoke, her eyes widened. She knew five different languages, but she wasn’t speaking any of them. And yet, she understood every word that left her mouth.  
  
  No emotion crossed the girl’s features, as if she were used to strange people yelling at her. “I am Rhoslyn, once personal servant to your mother but now personal servant to you. If you agree to keep me,” she added, unsure now. She, too, spoke in that weird, lyrical language of flowing syllables. “The queen has bid me to rouse you and escort you to her study. ”  
  
  Servant? Mother? Jane’s mother was dead, along with her father and her sister. The latter two had been killed on impact, the drunk driver having slammed his car into their side of the vehicle. Her mom, though…she had died right before Jane’s eyes, her life dripping out of her and onto Jane, their car propped against a tree, their seat belts holding them in place, the metal doors and roof smashed so completely they’d had to be pried out. But, by then, it had been too late. She’d already taken her last, pained breath.  
  
  She’d died the very day she was told her cancer was gone.  
  
  “Don’t you dare tease me about my mother,” Jane growled, and Rhoslyn flinched.  
  
  “I’m sorry, princess, but I do not understand. I tease you not about your mother’s summons. ” How frightened she sounded now. Tears even beaded in her dark eyes. “And I swear to you, I meant no offense. Please do not punish me. ”  
  
  Punish her? Was this some sort of joke?  
  
  The word joke was as familiar as the dizziness. But, really, joke still didn’t fit. Nervous breakdown, perhaps? No, couldn’t be. Breakdowns were a form of hysteria, and she was not hysterical. Plus, there was the language thing. Come on. You’re a scientist. You can reason this out.  
  
  “Where am I? How did I get here?” Her last memory was of reading the book and—the book! Where was the book? Her heart thundered uncontrollably, a storm inside her chest, as she panned her surroundings once more. There! Her book rested on the vanity, so close, yet so far away.  
  
   
; Mine, every cell in her body screamed, surprising her. Equally surprising, the absolute rightness of the claim. But then, she’d practically made love to the thing. And, oh, damn. Her blood heated and her skin tingled, her body readying for absolute, utter possession.  
  
  I need you, Jane. The text. She remembered the text. Come to me. Save me.  
  
  Consider this logically. She’d fallen asleep, dreamed of a vampire’s decadent touch and, like Alice in Wonderland, had woken up in a strange, new world. And she was awake. This was not a dream. So, where was she? How had she gotten here? What if…?  
  
  She cut off the thought before it could veer into a direction she didn’t like. There had to be a rational explanation. “Where am I?” she asked again.  
  
  As Jane scooted from the soft confines of the feather-lined mattress, the “servant” said, “You are in…Delfina. ” She spoke with a question in her tone, as if she couldn’t quite grasp the fact that Jane didn’t already know the answer. “A kingdom without time or age. ”  
  
  Delfina? She’d…heard of it, she realized with a start. Not the name, but the “kingdom without time. ” A few of the beings she’d interviewed had mentioned another realm, a magical realm, with differing kingdoms outside the notice of humans. At the time, she hadn’t known whether to believe them or not. They’d been prisoners, locked away for the good of mankind. They would have said anything to gain their freedom. Even offer to escort her into their world.  
  
  What if…?  
  
  What if she’d crossed the threshold from her world and into the other? Jane finally allowed the thought to reach its conclusion, and her stomach churned with sickness.  
  
  Before the car accident changed her life so radically, she’d studied more than the creatures of myth. She’d studied the manipulation of macroscopic energy, attempting the “impossible” on a daily basis. Like the molecular transfer of an object from one location—one world—to another, and she had succeeded. Not with life-forms, of course, not yet, but with plastic and other materials. That’s why she’d been deemed an acceptable risk for interacting with the captured beings, both dead and alive.

1mz4w88,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanSweepers/comments/1mz4w88/explore_if_weiman_hardwood_floor_cleaner_really/,Explore If Weiman Hardwood Floor Cleaner Really Delivers Shine,"Testing out the Weiman Hardwood Floor Cleaner Gallon and Refillable Squeeze Bottle felt like embarking on a mission to finally solve the streaky and hazy floors I’d begrudgingly accepted as part of my life. My hardwood floors have seen everything—muddy footprints, spilled coffee, and even an enthusiastic toddler’s crayon art. Needless to say, I was intrigued by the bold claims this specific cleaner makes, especially when it comes to streak-free results and its kid-and-pet-safe formulation.

**Effective Cleaning for High-Traffic Areas**

One thing that immediately stood out to me was how well this cleaner tackled high-traffic zones. My entryway and kitchen floors, typically scuffed and dull, looked noticeably refreshed after just one application. The product promises a streak-free experience, and I wholeheartedly agree with that claim. While my previous cleaners often left a cloudy film behind, this one left nothing but clean, shiny floors. The squeeze bottle design also made applying the solution straightforward and mess-free. Just squirt it on the floor and spread with a mop—it’s simple and effective.  

[Check Weiman Hardwood Floor Cleaner price on Amazon.](https://app.womanreview.com/p/b07nld5rjj/)  

**Genuinely Safe Ingredients**

Safety was another reason I decided to give this cleaner a go, especially given that my toddler has made a habit of crawling around the house like a miniature racecar. The cleaner uses plant-based ingredients, which gave me peace of mind knowing it was free of harsh chemicals. Once dried, it’s safe for both kids and pets to walk, crawl, or nap on the floor. Bonus points for ensuring I’m not filling my home with intense chemical odors—this cleaner remains subtle and non-overwhelming compared to others I’ve tried.

**Tailored for Finished Surfaces**

The product is marketed specifically for finished hardwood floors and extended its cleaning powers to engineered hardwood, laminate, and vinyl floors as well. I tested it across multiple surfaces, and while it performed well on laminate and vinyl, its effect on finished hardwood was where it truly shined. There’s an added radiance after cleaning that doesn’t feel artificial. If you’re questioning its compatibility with your floor type, rest assured this cleaner sticks to its promises—just avoid using it on unfinished wood to sidestep any mishaps.

**Highlights**

- Delivers streak-free cleaning results  
- Works effectively across multiple floor types  
- Kid-and-pet-safe once dried  
- Squeeze bottle design simplifies application  

**Packaging Convenience and Value Additions**

Apart from what’s inside, the packaging itself deserves a mention. This product comes in a gallon with a refillable squeeze bottle, making it a practical choice for those handling large square footage. Instead of buying individual bottles over and over, refilling the squeeze bottle takes seconds. Not only is this setup more cost-efficient, but it also cuts down on plastic waste—a small yet important win for sustainability enthusiasts.

**Areas for Improvement**

While my overall experience was massively positive, a couple of things could use some tweaking. The solution takes a bit longer to dry compared to other cleaners, which might be frustrating if you’re in a hurry. Additionally, though it delivers a fantastic shine, it doesn’t come with any disinfecting properties. This is something to keep in mind if you’re prioritizing both cleaning and sanitizing.

- Slightly long drying time  
- Lacks disinfecting features  

**Competing Products**

Comparing this product with others in the market, like Bona Hardwood Floor Cleaner, was inevitable. Bona shares a similar streak-free claim but tends to leave a slight residue if not used sparingly, making the Weiman cleaner a more forgiving choice for those heavy-handed with their mop. Another contender, Method’s Squirt + Mop, offers a great scent range, but its shine doesn’t quite match what Weiman provides. If fragrance is a priority, you might lean toward Method; for superior cleaning, however, Weiman holds its ground in a competitive market.

**Money's Worth**

Looking at performance versus cost, this product genuinely delivers quality for the price. Considering its practicality with a refillable option, it’s ideal for families—especially ones with busy households. It’s rare to find a floor cleaner that balances safety, efficacy, and convenience, all while maintaining affordability. For someone like me, who cleans incessantly yet doesn’t want added stress, the investment feels worthwhile.

I was talking to this girl for around 3 days and we had agreed to meet for coffee and a museum on the weekend. As soon as the date was agreed, she vanished. Never heard anything from her again.

I was talking to another girl who gave me her number. I messaged her and never heard anything back from her again, even though we had talked a lot on the app.

I was talking to a 3rd girl just yesterday who was being really interested in talking to me and last night she randomly stopped messaging me and still nothing back, so feeling like this is another ghost coming on.

Machine: Gaggia Classic 2015 with PID set at 200 degrees Fahrenheit.

Grinder: Eureka Mignon Notte

Maintenance: backflushed yesterday with cafiza, exiting water was light brown. Descaled with OM brand Gaggia descaler 1 week ago.

Tools:

Pesado 58.5 Tamper
Bottomless portafilter with triple or double basket.
Simple WDT tool 
Off brand leveler

What I typically do:
I like to use the triple basket with 22 grams in and 42 grams out. 

What I have been trying:
Use double basket with 22 grams in and 32 grams out. My goal in reducing basket size was that I would not have watery muddy picks because there is less space to work with.

Coffee I am currently working with: Barretts Brazil Bahia. I usually select beans that say notes of chocolate/honey because I like the sweet rich flavors. I buy 2.5 pounds at once and store it in a 5 pound airscape. My last bag was delivered August 4th and I am about halfway through it.

Plans for the future:
I ordered 50mm Eureka brand flat steel burrs to replace because I never have, and I figured it couldn't hurt. I also ordered a 3Bomber spring loaded tamper and same brand distribution tool. I am trying to correct errors in technique using these tools, because often when I am tamping I put my whole body weight into the press and that is probably an issue.

Any tips are greatly appreciated. I am coming from a nespresso, so I am still new at this whole process. :)",1,1756063443.0,gaggiaclassic,3,1.0,False

1mz4ssg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dsa/comments/1mz4ssg/organizing_and_recruiting_workers_to_marxism_in/,Organizing and Recruiting Workers to Marxism in Modern America,"Alright, let’s cut through the fog and get real: organizing and recruiting workers to Marxism in modern America is not a matter of dropping off some pamphlets and hoping for the best. It’s about building power where people live, work, and struggle. Here’s a breakdown:

# 1. Start from Material Conditions, Not Ideology

Workers don’t wake up in the morning thinking “I need dialectical materialism with my coffee.” They wake up thinking: *my rent is insane, my boss is squeezing me, my healthcare is garbage.* Recruitment starts with those struggles. Connect Marxist analysis to the everyday pain points:

* Rising rents → talk about landlords as a parasitic class.
* Low wages and union-busting → connect it to capitalist exploitation of surplus value.
* Debt (student, medical, credit) → show how it chains workers to capital.

You don’t lead with the red flag—you lead with their lived reality and *then* show how Marxism explains it.

# 2. Organize at the Point of Exploitation

Marxism isn’t a book club hobby; it’s rooted in class struggle. That means:

* **Workplace organizing**: supporting union drives, forming shop-floor committees, or helping workers resist speed-ups, wage theft, or unsafe conditions.
* **Community struggle**: fighting evictions, utility shut-offs, and predatory policing.
* **Tenant unions and mutual aid**: direct action around housing and survival builds real solidarity.

When workers fight and win—even small battles—they experience collective power. That’s where Marxism clicks.

# 3. Build Worker Institutions, Not Just Movements

Movements flare up and burn out. Institutions sustain power. Examples:

* Workers’ centers, tenant unions, strike funds, mutual aid networks.
* Socialist caucuses inside existing unions.
* Political education groups that connect struggles to larger theory.

These aren’t just “activist clubs”—they’re the embryo of dual power: spaces where workers govern themselves outside the capitalist state.

# 4. Political Education—But Grounded

Yes, people need Marxist theory. But don’t drop *Capital* on someone’s lap at the first meeting. Build up from struggle:

* Start with zines, podcasts, and short reading groups tied to workers’ real fights.
* Show how the boss makes profit off their labor (surplus value explained in plain English).
* Connect current crises—climate, housing, healthcare—to capitalism’s contradictions.

Education isn’t abstract; it’s the sharpening of tools for the fight they’re already in.

# 5. Culture and Propaganda

Workers don’t just join because of arguments—they join because of culture and community. Build spaces where people feel belonging:

* Social events, sports, music, even gaming groups tied to worker solidarity.
* Online propaganda that’s sharp, funny, and accessible (memes are often more effective than manifestos).
* Countering capitalist media with workers’ stories and alternative press.

Marxism has to *live* in culture, not just in pamphlets.

# 6. Recruitment is Relationship-Building

People don’t join movements because they got “convinced” in an argument—they join because they trust the people inviting them. That means:

* One-on-one conversations.
* Listening more than talking.
* Showing up consistently for workers in their struggles.

Trust builds power. Power builds movements. Movements build class consciousness.

# 7. The Long Game: From Struggles to Party

The endgame isn’t just protest or education; it’s a working-class party rooted in labor, tenants, and community struggles. Recruitment today should be tied to building that infrastructure. A party that’s *of the class, for the class*—not just an NGO with nicer slogans.

**In short:** meet workers where they are, organize around material needs, build durable institutions, tie every fight back to capitalism, and grow a culture that makes Marxism feel like the natural, necessary path.

Want me to sketch out a **step-by-step recruitment strategy** (like a “how-to manual” for building a Marxist worker organization in 2025 America), or would you prefer a **historical comparison**—how past socialist movements in the U.S. (like the IWW, CPUSA, or Black Panthers) approached recruitment?

# You said:

step-by-step recruitment strategy

# ChatGPT said:

Got it. Let’s lay down a **step-by-step recruitment strategy for organizing workers into Marxism in modern America**. Think of this as a practical manual—concrete, tactical, and rooted in building durable power.

# Step-by-Step Recruitment Strategy

# Step 1: Map the Terrain

* **Identify workplaces & communities under pressure**: warehouses, service jobs, healthcare, logistics, education, housing projects—anywhere class contradictions are sharp.
* **Map leaders & organic connectors**: who do people already trust? (The outspoken worker on shift, the tenant who rallies neighbors, the respected elder.)
* **Analyze power**: What leverage do workers have? What common grievances are simmering?

*Rule: don’t scattershot—focus where struggle can actually escalate.*

# Step 2: Build Relationships Before Politics

* **Start with listening**: Ask people about their conditions—wages, hours, bosses, bills. Take notes.
* **Find common grievances**: rent hikes, unsafe work, wage theft, medical debt.
* **Build trust**: Show up consistently (pickets, meetings, mutual aid, tenant court). Reliability is the first test of leadership.

*People join people, not abstract ideas. Recruitment begins in relationships.*

# Step 3: Agitate Through Shared Struggle

* **Turn complaints into campaigns**: unsafe work → petition; rent hike → collective action; abusive boss → public shaming or labor board charge.
* **Win small fights first**: even modest victories prove collective power (forcing a landlord to fix heat, making management back down).
* **Frame it politically**: Show how every battle is not just “bad boss/landlord” but capitalism functioning as designed.

*Agitation transforms frustration into political clarity.*

# Step 4: Introduce Marxism as a Tool, Not a Religion

* **Keep it grounded**: explain surplus value when workers talk about being overworked and underpaid.
* **Use simple, accessible materials**: zines, short pamphlets, podcasts, memes.
* **Tie theory to practice**: every organizing victory (or loss) becomes a teachable moment about class struggle.

*Marxism should feel like common sense, not homework.*

# Step 5: Develop Cadre Out of Leaders

* **Identify natural leaders**: those who move others, not just talk well.
* **Offer structured political education**: reading groups, workshops, history of U.S. labor struggles.
* **Sharpen their skills**: organizing conversations, running meetings, strategic thinking.

*Recruitment isn’t just adding members—it’s developing militants who can lead others.*

# Step 6: Create Institutions of the Class

* **Form organizations that outlast campaigns**: tenant unions, workers’ committees, strike funds, mutual aid groups.
* **Embed Marxists inside broader struggles**: unions, student groups, neighborhood associations.
* **Keep independent identity**: build explicitly socialist circles inside broader fights, so Marxist politics aren’t diluted.

*Institutions are the skeleton of long-term class power.*

# Step 7: Build Culture & Community

* **Host socials, meals, sports, arts nights**: politics without joy dies fast.
* **Create propaganda**: memes, podcasts, newsletters, TikToks—speak in the language of workers now, not 1930.
* **Celebrate victories**: nothing attracts people like a winning, lively movement.

*Culture glues militants together and makes Marxism feel lived, not preached.*

# Step 8: Consolidate into a Political Force

* **Connect struggles**: link the warehouse strike to the housing fight to the climate battle.
* **Form alliances**: with unions, community groups, radical caucuses.
* **Lay groundwork for a party**: not a loose activist scene, but a disciplined, rooted organization of the working class.

*Recruitment scales when people see they’re joining something bigger than one fight.*

# TL;DR Formula

1. **Listen & map** → 2. **Build trust** → 3. **Agitate through struggle** → 4. **Introduce Marxism** → 5. **Develop cadre** → 6. **Build institutions** → 7. **Forge culture** → 8. **Consolidate into party power.**",0,1756063311.0,dsa,0,0.33,False

I respect your faith, as long as you’re happy and not hurting anyone. I am interested in topics such anthropology and religion, and been looking at mormonism and mormons more like an interesting phenomenon. So my questions are:

1. How diverse is Mormonism? Were there any notable schisms? Do you differ from each other by theological views? 

2. Is plurality of Gods a real thing that was taught? Is it a part of your doctrine? 

3. Are everyone of you as ,,devoted”? I mean, as staying away from coffee since you were born? Do all of you obey those restrictions?

4. How do you some of the past actions of LDS church? It makes sense to think that Brigham Young new about mountain meadows massacre. 

5. Are Mormon women destined to become ,,divine mothers”? 

6. Do you believe that your God was a human before? 

I was just curious of your faith. I’ve never met a Mormon before, nor talked with any, as there are only about 1.5 k mormons living in my country. Btw, I do enjoy the idea of this sub. It’s nice that you guys do it, so people like me get a chance to ask all this.

  Waves crashed and rolled onto Kings Beach across the road, the white expanse of sand a beautiful thing. The ocean had long since washed away the bulk of the dead bodies and debris. Only the tank remained and each tide buried it deeper.  
  
  Angus had abandoned her. Which was probably for the best.  
  
  She couldn’t stand to watch him die too.  
  
  The summer sun was blindingly bright, the weather hot and humid, typical for January. Or was it February? She’d lost track of the days.  
  
  Natalie breathed in the salty sea air as she huddled behind the curtains. She watched the world from four floors up. The penthouse apartment, because Sean had to have the best. No matter her terrible fear of heights.  
  
  Another sucky relationship indicator she’d chosen to ignore.  
  
  Sean wasn’t looking so good anymore.  
  
  His body was black and bloated, floating facedown on the surface of the large and lavish lagoon-style pool below. The stench of decay didn’t tend to reach her unless it happened to be a particularly still day. Sean hadn’t believed the reports on the TV and internet. He’d mocked her when she’d filled the bathtub and every other available container with water, shut up the unit and flat-out refused to leave. Sean had wanted to swim some laps, do a little sunbaking. Plus the beautiful blonde from the unit next door had been down there, artfully arranged on a sun-lounge in her teeny, tiny yellow bikini.  
  
  It hadn’t ended well for either of them.  
  
  Hmm.  
  
  What was Angus doing?  
  
  Had he gotten away?  
  
  She bet he had. He was brave. Smart. Resourceful.  
  
  And damn fine-looking. Not that a thirty-two-year-old woman should be checking out a twenty-three-year-old boy, but hey … she might as well get her kicks where she could. Happy thoughts these days were few and far between.  
  
  He’d be okay. He’d be fine. She’d know it if something had happened to him. She’d feel it somehow.  
  
  Natalie scrubbed away a tear with the back of her hand.  
  
  Stupid. Pointless. The resort had become a death trap and she was caught. It was for the best that he’d gone.  
  
  The walkie-talkie sat beside her though, just in case.  
  
  So did the bottle of sleeping pills.  
  
  One of the infected out in the hallway rattled the door handle. Her breath stuck in her throat and her fingers clutched at the curtain. A pounding started deep inside her skull. They couldn’t get in. Not a chance. She’d barricaded the door with the chunky Asian-style coffee table. Backed it up with a couple of the heavy dining chairs for good luck and prosperity. She was safe.  
  
  Safe, but stuck.  
  
  Darkness owned the hallway. There was no night or day for the ones trapped in there. For them, every hour was party hour. She’d long since gotten used to getting by on little sleep. The three caught in the pool area below were huddled beneath the sun-lounges, cowering. Infected didn’t like bright light. And they couldn’t climb. She’d watched them try to clamber over the shoulder-high pool fence again and again, snarling and growling in frustration.  
  
  Like her, they were stuck.  
  
  They too would slowly starve.  
  
  She had enough food for a few more days, but after that …  
  
  The size of her ass had once been an issue for Sean. He’d helpfully stocked the kitchen cupboard with a variety of diet bars and drinks lest she be tempted to enjoy herself over the Christmas break. She’d been furious. Beyond words.  
  
  But without those supplies she wouldn’t have lasted a week.  
  
  Angus had been a miracle, magically appearing in the garden on the other side of the pool. He’d spotted her somehow, stuck in the apartment. He’d stood below the cluster of palm trees, arms waving madly and a gorgeous, crazy-ass grin on his face. She’d thought she was alone.  
  
  Angus played AFL. He also had a decent throwing arm. He’d demonstrated it by chucking care packages up onto her balcony. Protein bars, bottles of water. The walkie-talkie, wrapped tight in a towel so it didn’t shatter on impact. Lots of batteries, because they ended up talking for hours about everything and anything. His aim wasn’t perfect. One time, he accidentally smashed the glass door of the apartment next to her. Infected had shambled out, emerging from all their various hiding places, alerted by the noise to the possibility of a free meal. Angus could run like a demon, not that he had to. Infected didn’t move fast.  
  
  Natalie snuffled, blinked furiously. Crying didn’t help. So why had it become her favourite pastime?  
  
  He was gone. A good thing.  
  
  Right.  
  
  She sucked in a breath.  
  
  Except he wasn’t gone.  
  
  Suddenly, Angus was right there, below her. Striding into view and marching across the courtyard. Heading straight for the pool gate like he was contemplating a dip in the fetid green waters. There was a pack on his back and a sawn-off shotgun in his hands.  
  
  Her heart punched hard.  
  
  No, no, no. The noise. They’d swarm him.  
  
  Natalie scrambled to her feet and shot out onto the balcony. Too damn scared for the young man below to worry about the vertigo assailing her. Too busy to freeze up in fear. He couldn’t be here. It was too dangerous. “Angus!”  
  
  The metal lock on the gate clattered as he pulled it up. Rusty hinges squealed as he kicked the gate open. He stomped into the pool area like some warrior of old and the infected stirred beneath their sun-lounges. A blonde head tangled with dried blood appeared from beneath the green and white striped cushions. The gate clanged shut behind Angus, locking him in.  
  
  “Angus! No! Get out of here!”  
  
  He didn’t look up, didn’t acknowledge her. His focus stayed total.  
  
  The blonde in the dirty yellow bikini struggled to her feet, a low growl emanating from her throat. A middle-aged man with a sunken belly and mangy red boardies followed her.  
  
  Angus didn’t pause.  
  
  He aimed the gun, pulled the trigger.  
  
  Boom!  
  
  The deafening blast took out the blonde’s head and splattered the middle-aged man with blood and grey matter. Blinded, the infected male stumbled back, moaning, his hands waving urgently in front of his face. Angus fired again and the man flew backward, landing sprawled across the lounges. Eviscerated.  
  
  Oh, hell. God. There was … there was a sickening amount of blood.  
  
  Angus looked up at her, victorious. His blue eyes squinted into the midday sun. “Gimme a minute. I’ll climb up. ”  
  
  She blinked stupidly. He’d done it! He’d actually done it.  
  
  “You’re insane. ”  
  
  His gorgeous face broke into a broad grin and her stomach swan-dived. He was really there. He’d come back for her. She wasn’t alone.  
  
  But neither was Angus.  
  
  A third infected stumbled out from beneath a nearby picnic table, its bloody mouth snarling. Angus hadn’t seen the thing yet. Its arms were outstretched, reaching for him.  
  
  “Behind you!”  
  
  Angus spun and the infected fell upon him, taking them both down. His shotgun clattered to the side, out of reach. The two bodies struggled on the ground directly beneath her, four stories down. Angus gripped the thing’s shoulders, wrestling with it, trying to push it off. The infected’s head twisted and jerked, yellow teeth snapping.  
  
  “Angus!” She strangled the railing, panic rattling her bones. She was going to wet herself. It was so far down. It was. But she had to help him, had to do something.  
  
  But what?  
  
  The only weapons she had were a set of steak knives and they weren’t going  
to cut it.  
  
  What to use? There were pot plants. Two of them. Heavy, ugly, ornamental things, cluttering up the balcony.  
  
  If she could just lift one.  
  
  Her sweaty hands slipped on the glaze, baked hot from the sun. She could do this. Natalie scrubbed her hands on her shorts, drying them. Tried again. Her back strained, shoulders protesting. It was bloody heavy. Slowly, she lifted it. Not dropping it. Not yet.  
  
  “Throw him off, Angus! Get him off you!”  
  
  There was a flash of blue eyes from below. Angus kept moving, struggling, but she couldn’t see … oh, shit. Angus was strong. He was fast. He could do this. He could. She’d never been big on faith. But she had faith in him.  
  
  Angus gave a grunt and a heave and the infected flew backwards. Angus rolled to the side, scrunched up into a ball.  
  
  Now.  
  
  Natalie pushed the pot off the railing. Gravity took over and it plummeted straight down. The infected was rising slowly from the ground, ready to attack Angus again. The pot smashed into its shoulder and the thing tumbled back onto the pavement, arm dangling crookedly and a low moan coming from its mouth.  
  
  Angus wasted no time. He leapt to his feet, grabbed the shotgun and reversed it. Rammed the stock into the thing’s face. Bone splintered and cracked. It didn’t move again.  
  
  Thank God.  
  
  Other infected had gathered below. They stood rattling the fence, wanting in. The chorus of moaning grew louder by the minute. Angus had a hell of an audience assembling, straining against the barrier, bloody hands reaching out to grab him. The glare of the sun obviously forgotten in their hunger.  
  
  “Hurry,” she hissed. Loudly. “Get up here. ”  
  
  Angus nodded and shoved the shotgun into his pack. Pulled up a deck chair and stepped onto it, stretching, reaching up for the first-floor balcony. He started to climb. He was moving. He was safe. It would all be okay.  
  
  But the ground loomed below and blood surged hot inside Natalie’s head, drowning out everything like a bass drum beating loud behind her ears. She staggered back from the railing, legs like water. Throat shut tight and her shoulders up to her ears.  
  
  It was so high. The balcony was bad.  
  
  Really. Just. Bad.  
  
  She stumbled inside, sat her butt back on the thick carpeting before she fell down. Breathing deep. Waiting.  
  
  It didn’t take him long to reach her.  
  
  Angus’s big hands gripped the bars of the railing and he pulled himself up slowly. The muscles in his arms bunched and strained in ways that took her mind off the height thing. His eyes shone and his teeth were gritted but he gave her a wide, relieved smile when he cleared the top. She grinned back, helpless to resist. If she hadn’t already been sitting she would have hit the floor.He was actually there. He hadn’t left her after all, this beautiful boy.  
  
  “Hey,” he said.  
  
  “Hey, yourself. ” Her eyes welled anew. “Are you hurt anywhere?”  
  
  “No. ” He looked taller than she’d realised. He seemed … well, it was harder to dismiss him as a boy when he was this close. When he had just risked his life for her. Angus knelt down in front of her, dark brows drawn together. “Are you alright?”  
  
  She nodded, hoped it was convincing. Seemed she’d used up her daily allotment of courage. Her trembling hands itched to grab hold of him. To hold on tight and never let him go, keep him safe somehow. Huh. She’d probably scare the crap out of the poor guy.  
  
  “You sure?” he asked, eyes not unkind. “You’re looking kind of freaked out. ”  
  
  “Oh, I’m fine. ” She gave a rough laugh. “Another day in paradise. ”  
  
  Angus didn’t laugh.  
  
  He had short, dark blonde hair and a strong jaw covered in stubble. His nose was a little wide, his mouth a little generous. Pale blue eyes as clear as the summer sky stared back at her. “You went out onto the balcony, Nat. That was really brave. ”  
  
  “No, what you did was brave. I threw a pot. ”  
  
  “I’d be dead if you hadn’t been there. ”  
  
  “Oh. I was worried about you. ” Natalie tucked her brown hair behind her ears, studied her toes. Over-aware of everything all of a sudden. The way he watched her was … intense. Sitting around in her shorts and a tank top had seemed wise back when she hadn’t been expecting any visitors. Angus wore sneakers and cargo shorts, a T-shirt of some band she didn’t know. The Soviet X-Ray Record Club, whoever they were. He looked good, while she showed a lot of skin – including dimpled thighs definitely not belonging to a girl in her twenties.  
  
  Such a stupid thing to worry about, given the situation.  
  
  Natalie wrapped her arms around her knees, rocked back. Gave the poor guy some room from the desperate thirty-something eyeing him off like a meat tray at a raffle.  
  
  He gave a cautious smile and edged closer. “I can’t believe we’re finally in the same room together. ”  
  
  “I know! What were you thinking?”  
  
  One thick shoulder rose and fell, and he sat back on his heels, nonplussed.  
  
  “I’m serious, Angus. You could have been bitten. I thought you’d left town. ”  
  
  “No. ”  
  
  “Why didn’t you leave? It was the smart thing to do. ”  
  
  His features tightened and he leant in, getting in her face. “I wasn’t leaving without you. ”  
  
  “I wouldn’t have blamed you—”  
  
  “I would have blamed me. ”  
  
  “There were three of them in there. ” Her voice rose in pitch. “You can’t risk yourself like that. What if you’d been infected?”  
  
  “I didn’t get any blood on me. Natalie. ” His lips were a grim line, face deadly serious as he stared her down. He reached out and touched her, curled his fingers round the back of her neck. Stroking. “Listen to me. ”  
  
  Natalie stopped, stunned. It felt so good. He felt so good, his mouth hovering over hers. His body was close, filling her head with the scent of clean male sweat, of the sun and sand. Everything else fell away. It was just a simple touch, but it had been so long. Even before the world went to hell Sean had been disinterested, at best. The press of Angus’s hand against her skin, the warmth of his palm. It all served to remind her that she was still alive and so was he.  
  
  “I wouldn’t leave you,” he said. Pale blue eyes so serious and intense and lovely. And young. Best not to forget that amid the haze of dirty thoughts. “I won’t do that. Do you understand?”  
  
  She nodded, more than a little mesmerised.  
  
  “Good. You and me against the world. ”  
  
  “Okay,” she said, arching her neck ever so subtly.  
  
  “Shit. ” Angus gave her a startled look and retracted his hand in a rush. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to grab at you like that. ”  
  
  “Oh, it’s alright. I don’t mind. ”  
  
  He frowned, the skin between his dark brows ridging. “You don’t?”  
  
  “No. ” He had risked his life for her. He could have been killed, this beautiful boy dead and gone. The thought bled her dry. Her hands shook and her spine bowed. She hunched over her knees and held on tight. “But you have to be more careful from now on. ”  
  
  “Do you mean that?” he asked.  
  
  “Yes, emphatically. ”  
  
  “No. I mean about my hand. ”  
  
  “Oh. ” Her eyelids started batting like crazy, beyond her control. “Yes. It’s fine. ”  
  
  Angus stared at her, said nothing.  
  
  “So … any ideas about what comes next?”  
  
  “Yeah. ” He leant forward and kissed her.  
  
  \*\*\*  
  
  Natalie’s mouth was amazing. But then, he’d known it would be.  
  
  Angus slanted his head, kissed her again. Slower. Without butting her in the nose this time. He brushed his lips against hers, stroked her neck. Her skin felt silken warm, her soft hair tickling the back of his hand.  
  
  If only she’d kiss him in return.  
  
  He set a good example, hoping. Hoping and waiting as ever-fucking-patiently as he could manage. Only, he’d been waiting weeks to get this close. Maybe weeks wasn’t long in the old scheme of things, but right now it seemed like a lifetime.  
  
  He’d come to the coast with some uni friends for a couple of weeks’ holiday. A chance to do some surfing and see out the New Year. The virus hit Christmas Eve and by Boxing Day his friends were dead. Everyone was dead or gone. It spread like a bushfire, the streets soon empty of all except for the infected. There had been the whine of jet engines, followed by ground-shaking explosions as bombs were dropped inland at the hospital, killing infected and innocent alike. Gunfire. Screaming. The power went out two days after Christmas. He’d holed up in the hotel basement for a fortnight, living off cans of spaghetti and dry Weet-Bix. Everything had been cemetery-still when he emerged. So quiet. He’d wandered around, hiding at night, hoping to find someone still alive. Someone uninfected. Then he’d found her.  
  
  Natalie.  
  
  She’d been pacing past her balcony doors. Stalking back and forth, back and forth, darting the outside world nervous glances. Her long dark hair had been tied back in a ponytail, swinging every time she did her abrupt about-face. She’d been wearing the same denim shorts and green singlet top she had on now. Natalie had the best rack. He knew he shouldn’t think shit like that about her, but it was amazing. He’d been lugging around binoculars and finally, that day, he knew why.  
  
  “Natalie?” He opened his eyes. Hers were huge. Shocked. Oh, no. Had he read her wrong? His dick was killing him, fucking with his head. Maybe she hadn’t meant what he’d thought she’d meant. He swallowed hard and cursed. “Is this okay?”  
  
  “You want …” Her lips grazed his as she spoke because he wasn’t moving back. Not until she said to. She looked so much prettier up close. The sweet curves of her face, the dent in her chin. Everything about her worked for him.  
  
  “Yeah. I, ah … I …” He rubbed his thumb against the back of her neck and her skin goosepimpled beneath his touch. Good or bad? Shit. He had no idea. So what if she said no. He’d survive it, somehow. What he couldn’t do was not try. And why this felt harder than storming into that fucking enclosure, he didn’t know. “I want you. ”  
  
  There. It was said.  
  
  Her eyes went impossibly wider and her breath hitched.  
  
  Except he wanted to make sure there were no mistakes this time.  
  
  Angus sucked in a breath, let it out. “I mean, I want to have sex with you. Now. ”  
  
  Natalie’s eyes darkened and her mouth opened. But she said nothing for the longest time. Her dark brows drawn tight and lips perfectly still.  
  
  He could have choked on the silence.  
  
  There was a softly mumbled “fuck it”. Th  
en her soft hands cupped his face, drawing him in. And God, he wanted in. More than he could remember ever wanting anything, he wanted inside of her.  
  
  “Okay, Angus,” she said. “Yes. I want that too. I want us to forget about everything for a while. ”  
  
  Coherent thought sailed straight out the window. He smashed his lips to hers. Shoved his tongue into her mouth. There was nothing smooth or controlled about it.  
  
  Natalie made a noise beneath him and it might have been laughter but he was too busy to care. Too taken up with kissing her, deep and wet. The taste of her filled him and he was full to bursting already. His balls aching and his dick so hard it hurt. Her fingers slipped into his hair, holding him to her as she stroked her tongue against his. Nipped at him. Kissed him.  
  
  Gave him all the encouragement he needed.  
  
  Pure instinct drove him. He slid a hand behind her back, taking his weight on the other, easing her back onto the carpet. Getting her underneath him. Getting between her thighs so he could rub his hard-on against her like some horny kid.  
  
  He had to be as close to her as he could be.  
  
  His hand fumbled over her shirt, shaking like shit embarrassingly enough, seeking out a breast. He felt sixteen all over again, unsure and overexcited. The hard point of a nipple scraped against the palm of his hand through her layers of material and he closed his fingers around her. God. She was more than a handful, all over. Her body felt so right, soft and curvy. Fucking perfect. But there were too many clothes between them. Far too many.  
  
  He was in a mad rush, verging on panic, and he couldn’t seem to slow down. Need hammered at his head. “Natalie …”  
  
  “Easy,” she soothed, kissing the side of his mouth, his jaw. Her lips swollen and the skin on her chin pink from his stubble.  
  
  “You really want this?”  
  
  “Very much so. ”  
  
  Relief flooded him. He curved his arms up around her head, pressed his face into her neck and squeezed his eyes tight. “Thank fuck.   
  
  “I really thought you’d left. ” Her voice cracked and he reared back. Her eyes were liquid-bright.

I Wish I Had a Time Machine

I wish Einstein had stayed alive a little longer — not for physics, but so he could invent a time machine to stop me from saying “yes” to a boy I didn’t actually like. This is the story of how I accidentally broke a pure soul, ate a lot of Maggi, and learned what heartbreak really feels like.

Everyone remembers their first heartbreak. Not because it’s the most dramatic, but because it’s the first time you realize how fragile people’s feelings — and your own — really are. This is mine.



Part 1: Meeting Kabir

I met Kabir during my MBA program. We clicked quickly. He was thoughtful, funny in his quiet way, and the kind of person you could talk to about nothing for hours without getting bored.

We’d sit on the terrace late at night, share Maggi, and talk about everything — placements, friendships, life, random dreams. It was easy with him, almost too easy. I didn’t realize then how much he was beginning to feel for me.



Part 2: The Confession

Placement season was stressful. One night, while we were on the terrace again, Kabir paused mid-conversation, looked me straight in the eyes, and said:

> “I like you. Very, very, very much.”



I froze. I didn’t want to hurt him, but I also didn’t know how to say no. So, in panic, I said the one thing that changed everything:

> “I like you too.”



He lit up instantly, the happiest I’d ever seen him. And that’s when it hit me: I didn’t mean it. My “yes” came from shock, fear, and not knowing what else to say.

Later, I tried to soften it by asking for “time.” He agreed, with patience only someone like Kabir could have. But the truth was, I already knew I didn’t feel the same way.

The more time we spent together, the more I felt trapped. One day, when he asked me directly where he stood in my life, I blurted out the harshest answer:

> “Nowhere.”



It broke him. He cried, and my heart sank.

Soon after, at a café ironically named Coffee Confessions, I finally told him the truth:

> “I don’t like you that way. I never will. Please move on.”



He didn’t argue. He didn’t lash out. He just said quietly:

> “Okay. I just wish you’d told me earlier. I hope we’ll always be friends.”



And that was it.



Part 3: Aftermath

After that, life moved quickly. Kabir got placed. I cried the day he left, still hoping maybe our paths would cross again.

Eventually, I moved to the US. He even called before I left to wish me well, saying:

> “You deserved something better. I hope you’ll always be happy.”



But instead of happiness, all I felt was regret.

In the US, I couldn’t stop thinking about him. I confessed again — this time honestly, because I finally meant it. But by then, Kabir had moved on. He was kind, as always, but firm:

> “No.”



And he was right. Why should someone as pure as him wait around for someone who only realized his worth too late?

Even now, I catch myself wanting to call him five, six times a day. And even now, he picks up, listens, and gently reminds me:

> “I’m here as a friend. But only if that doesn’t give you false hope.”



That’s the thing about Kabir — even while healing from his own heartbreak, he still cared about mine.

And me? I’m just left wishing Einstein had invented that time machine. Not to change the universe, but just to go back to that terrace, look into Kabir’s eyes, and give the honest answer I never had the courage to say.

1: dress: I like colors and patterns, but I’d say my usual style is pretty basic, tshirt, jeans , flannel or sweaters.

2: purpose: we live in a crazy world, pain and suffering is basically inevitable but I believe we can all still choose hope, kindness , to find joy, and grow into the best version of ourselves.

3: anime: haikyu I played volleyball as a kid with my friends and always wanted to be a real player but my parents never let me join a team. 

4: study: I was in dental school, but dropped out for health reasons. Now I study mental illness for fun and to help people who struggle. 

5: sport: tennis, I did play tennis in middle school and now ask my friends to play tennis with me for fun all the time. Though recently we’ve started playing some pickleball as well. 

6: book: I recently started reading Atomic Habits and I’ve been thoroughly enjoying it. Very interesting 10/10 

7: zodiac: I’m a Libra sun , Scorpio moon, Scorpio Rising

8:season: fall, all the phases of fall are great but I especially love when it rains.

9: food: chipotle. But sushi and soup is also amazing.

10:games. Board and card game nights are some of my favorites

11 place: the woods/mountains. Especially near water. I like the quiet.

12: Hobbies : see above. Also taking random tests like what pizza am I ?

13: music: these are some of my favorites, but I love anything that has a true meaning behind it, lyrics I can feel. Also, classical music or fantasy music. 
 
14 cartoon: snoopy, it’s nostalgic.

15 manwha: no idea what that really is, but I think a comic if some sort. Gabriel piccolos books are the closest I’ve gotten to reading comics. 

16 drink: Coffee, water, sparkling water

17 colour: dark navy blue, light powdery grey blues, maroon 

18: Animal: Tigers- they are baby, just big kitties that I want to squish their floofy faces!

19: eyes: it was hard to find a picture similar to my eye color, I have these weird light sage/grey/green eyes with like a dark grey rim and a grey spot in one eye

20: car: I drive a Honda but I want a challenger or charger.

21: movies: these are nostalgic and very comforting for me, I can’t just pick one-

22: plant : willow trees, my grandparents had one and growing up us kids would picnic under it, play , “sunbathe” and rest. I want one so badly if I ever live on the land for it. 

23: career:  honestly I wish sleeping paid the bills , I’d be rich and get my nine hours in every day. Plus nap bonuses. But I’m actually in Retail management and I love it but I really don’t want to work lol. 

24: hair: I have really long dark brown hair. I have no framing pieces and some natural lighter highlights from being outside. I’ve also got some white hairs that appeared even though I’m barely in my 20s. 
 
I think I’m over but - 

Random: my friends can’t decide if I’d be an air or fire bender. I’m in slytherin, I wanted to be in gryffindor. If I could be a hobbit or elf, I would.  Love life is not a priority, if it happens, it happens, but I’m okay on my own too.

As someone who starts every morning with caffeine, I put this machine to the test, armed with varying cravings for espresso, cappuccino, or a good old iced coffee. On days when I crave something indulgent, it whips up lattes and cappuccinos like it’s competing with my favorite coffee shop. And when friends come over? It shifts gears, brewing a full 12-cup carafe to fuel lively conversations.

**Design and Build Quality**

This machine’s sleek black plastic design is modern yet practical in its presence. Yet, what struck me most was how efficiently it fit on my counter without hogging all the real estate. The fold-away frother is genius—a space-saver that delivers creamy, flawless foam. The Ninja CFN601 doesn’t just look pretty, though; its 19-bar pressure system isn’t messing around. The crema on my espresso was rich and dreamy, just like a barista might deliver at my local café. The removable water reservoir made refills a breeze, and it’s dishwasher-safe—an unsung hero for those of us who avoid hand-washing at all costs.

**Pluses**

- Exceptional 19-bar pressure for café-quality espresso.  
- Compatible with both coffee grounds and espresso capsules.  
- Built-in frother folds away when not in use to save space.  
- Spacious used capsule bin stores up to 20 capsules for easy recycling.  

[Check Ninja CFN601 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0b9yp76fn/)

**Performance Features**

If performance were a beverage, this machine would be a triple-shot espresso kind of superstar. It tackles multiple brew styles with precision—Classic, Rich, and Over Ice for grounds—and Espresso, Lungo, or Over Ice for capsules. As a flavor perfectionist (call me picky if you must), I appreciated how seamlessly it adjusted the temperature and pressure to suit each drink. Iced coffee tasted like a summer escape, while my hot coffee brewed evenly without teetering into bitterness. The semi-automatic operation struck a fine balance between giving me control without overwhelming me with too many steps.

**Coffee Settings and Functionality**

As a sucker for variety, I enjoyed diving into the nine brew sizes this machine offers. Whether I needed a single cup to get through my emails or a travel mug for a busy errand-filled day, this machine delivered. Carafe brewing for my family brunch hit a sweet spot, with rich coffee at just the right temperature. Speaking of thoughtful features, Delay Brew was perfect for those lazy mornings when I wanted to wake up to the smell of fresh coffee. It even earned brownie points for its Keep Warm function, which avoided that all-too-familiar ""last sip of cold coffee"" disappointment.

**Negatives**

- No capsules included out of the box, so you’ll have to get stocked up separately.  
- The black plastic build, while sleek, could feel a little less premium compared to full-metal options.  

**Competitors**

Machines like the Breville Barista Express or the De’Longhi Dedica are definite contenders. However, the Ninja CFN601 has a unique edge thanks to its espresso capsule compatibility and its dual functionality with coffee grounds. Breville offers a bit more control for those who want to geek out on tamping and grinding, while De’Longhi is renowned for its compact designs. That said, neither matches the Ninja model’s built-in frother convenience or versatile brew size options.

**Smart Spending**

Evaluating the price-to-quality ratio, this product sits comfortably in a sweet spot. It offers a lot for its cost—espresso brewing, capsule compatibility, carafe-sized capabilities, and a handy Delay Brew feature, to name a few perks. While there are more premium machines with additional metal construction or cutting-edge features, they often come at a much higher price point. If you're looking for versatility, semi-automatic convenience, and a hint of café in your kitchen, this product easily earns its place among budget-friendly treasures.

I live a healthy lifestyle, I eat small nutritious portions with some snacks here and there (still a teen at heart, don't blame me), I don't drink alcohol/soda/coffee/juice, I walk everywhere because I don't want to drive and never have, but somehow I am always sick and in extreme widespread pain. My bones ache deep inside, my ribcage and spine feel distorted, my skin is discoloured and I develop rashes easily, I have terrible circulation, I get sick (colds/flus/viruses/infections) easily, nausea, heartburn, migraines, weakness all over. The list just goes on and on. Sometimes when I take a careless step, I feel like my whole leg will fall out at the hip or knee or both. I have had several ER visits because of the indescribable pain in my abdomen followed up by every single test being inconclusive, including extremely intrusive ultrasounds (my least favourite) where I'm left limp and sobbing just from the pain of being touched, especially on my right side. Today I had enough when an after-hours doctor I just met tried to prescribe me amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant that requires lots of patient consultation and monitoring) because I cried at this one-time appointment. She barely explained this medication to me, I had to research it myself when I got home and apparently it has several adverse effects and is no longer really used for anything aside from extreme depression and insomnia (don't quote me on this, I'm doing my best with the info I have). She only seemed to care that I had trouble sleeping, not that I feel like my neck could break when I lay my head on a pillow (something that I would love to enjoy the coziness of). 

I feel so dehumanized and I'm starting to give up on the doctors. I'm not depressed, I love my life so much aside from this pain. I've been 80% bedridden for the last 3 days and sleeping for most of it, so I don't think I have insomnia either. I'm honestly starting to consider a wheelchair or some kind of mobility aid, but I'm still in denial. Also, I'm Canadian so healthcare is free. Does this mean they just neglect people?

Aight, let’s break this down from the top — what even are enrolls?
Enrolls are just cards that’ve been linked to 3rd party money apps or card control services like:
💳 Digital Card Services
🧾 Dxonline
🛡️ CardValet
📱 CardNav
Basically, someone took a card and set it up on one of those platforms. Why? ‘Cause it gives them access to the card’s inner life: balance, transactions, and even mini deposits.

🛠️ Why Are Enrolls So Useful?
If you’re just grabbing random cards with no info, you're going in blind. Could be a $5 card. Could be -$200 in the red. But with enrolls, you actually see:
💰 Live balance – no guessing games
🪙 Mini deposits – perfect for linking to sites like Coinbase or PayPal
📊 Transactions – so you can act like you’re not sketchy af when you use it

💡 How Each Feature Gets Used
Live Balance Super obvious. You know exactly how much you can “spend” before raising alarms. If it's got $312.46, you ain't gonna blow $500 and get insta-flagged.
Mini Deposits Ever tried adding a card to Coinbase and it’s like: “We sent two small charges — tell us the amounts.” Well if you got the enroll, you see those numbers in real-time. Boom, verified.
Transaction History Say the card’s been buying coffee, groceries, maybe some gas. Then outta nowhere it gets hit with a $700 designer hoodie? Instant fraud alert. So what do carders do? They “warm it up.” Buy a $7 meal. Wait. Maybe a bus ticket. Then go for the big hit. Makes it look like a real person.

🔓 The Secret Sauce? Non-VBV Enrolls
Why? No extra verification. No OTPs. No 3D Secure pages that need real phone numbers or emails. Just smooth checkout.
And if a site does ask for mini deposit verification? You got that in the bag thanks to the enroll. Simple as that.

 Totally up to you who you buy from — no pressure. If you’d rather pay double somewhere else, that’s your call, But if you decide to buy from us it would be a pleasure! just dm me and ask for the shop link or if your completely new tell us your budget and we can recommend something! Either way, enjoy the game while these enrolls are still running. 💳🔥

So yeah, my last post about walking being the best damn exercise got some traction. I woke up to a bunch of comments and DMs. The one common DM though was basically:
“Doc, I get that walking is great for health. But how do I actually stay consistent with it day after day?”

I’m probably the only board-certified physician hanging around here willing to answer with actual science and a little profanity. And yeah, before anyone chirps—I use ChatGPT and other AI tools to help grab research and correct grammar. If that bugs you, then this post is not for you. I’m not here to sell you secret walking goat collagen powder. Some of this is straight from science, some from lived experience, and some is just obvious common sense wrapped in sarcasm, and I’m here to help provide value to those who want it and hopefully make it fun to read.
–––
Here are some science-based ways to make your habit stick:

step 1: call yourself a walking god
This for me is the most important. It’s similar to when someone offers you a cigarette and you say “No thanks, I’m not a smoker” and think to yourself get those cancer sticks out of my face. 

You gotta start by saying it out loud: “I’m a motherfing walker.” If you don’t believe it, none of this will stick. Tell yourself, “I’m the type of person who does X number of steps a day.”
Me? I do 10k. I started at 6k, moved to 8k, then went to 10k when that felt too easy. Not gonna lie, some nights I’m pacing my living room like a psycho to hit the last 1.5k before bed.
–––

step 2: make it stupid easy
* Pick a time you won’t flake on. Morning after coffee? After dinner? Doesn’t matter—just guard it like your grandma guards her cheesecake recipe.
* Stack it onto things you already do:
    * brush teeth → walk
    * morning pee → walk
    * drop kids off → walk
–––

step 3: reward yourself
Walking is basically a cheat code for a snack. Grab a bar, smoothie, or ice cream—whatever works. Just don’t eat three pints or you’ll need to walk a marathon to burn that off.
–––

step 4: play the long game
Forget perfection. Miss a day? That’s fine. The real key is not letting one skipped day turn into quitting altogether. Just get back on track the next day. And if you can, try not to miss more than 2 days in a row—because momentum is everything.

Make walking the default:
* Do it while on calls (except if you’re clumsy, then stick to just walking)
* Take the stairs
* Park farther away
–––

step 5: references
* James Clear. Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones. Avery, 2018.
* ChatGPT (OpenAI). Assisted with research summaries, grammar edits, and bad joke quality control.
–––

Alright ladies and gents, hopefully that helps some of you. And if you didn’t like that, you’re probably a clanker.

1mz4gm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1mz4gm7/my_girlfriend_wont_stop_stealing_my_yawnees/,My Girlfriend Won't Stop Stealing My Yawnees,"My girlfriend Jamie and I have been living together for three months now. By all accounts we’re a perfectly normal couple. We met on Tinder about half a year ago, and we bonded over the fact that we’re both accountants. I noticed QuickBooks in the background of one of her pictures and made some cheesy joke about wanting to know the *ledger* of her personality.



We went on a date, one thing led to another, and we were officially boyfriend and girlfriend within a month. When the lease on her studio apartment came to an end a few weeks later, she said that she wanted to come live with me. I was hesitant. I thought about my parents’ disdain for my cousin who moved in with her boyfriend before marriage. It took them over a year to start talking to her again.



When I confided in Jamie, she went on this long passionate rant. We were meant to be together; we couldn’t let what other people thought stop us. “I love you,” she said for the very first time.



Seeing how passionate she was made me *sure* that she was the one for me. I was excited about the idea of being star-crossed lovers, though my family still doesn’t know that we’re living together.



The move in was easy. She threw away or donated most of her belongings, and she didn’t bring any pictures or decorations. Just the clothes on her back and some more in a duffle bag.



The first month was amazing. We ate breakfast every morning and slept cuddled up every night. I was so happy. It’s always been hard for me to find someone I enjoy sharing my space with, and the fact that I could be with her for hours and hours and never get bored was amazing.



We were watching a movie one night. Jamie was cuddled up against my shoulder, and I was getting pretty tired. As I began to yawn, she leaned her head around so that our noses were touching, and opened her mouth wide.



She made a sucking sound like someone slurping a straw. It continued until my mouth was closed. 



“I stole your yawnee!” she said, then scooted back to my side.



I just stared. It was so shocking coming from her. I can probably count on one hand the amount of times she’s ever made a joke. I mean, this was the type of girl who emailed me calendar invites for date nights; sometimes she started her text messages with “Hello, Robert.”



It was so out of the blue, but I was happy to see that she was getting comfortable enough to show me her silly side. I laughed and we continued watching the movie. 



Over the next few weeks she “stole my yawnee” every so often. Maybe a few times a week, and never more than once or twice in a day.But over time it started to lose its cuteness. Even if it’s your girlfriend, it’s kinda gross to have someone suck up your yawn. When the novelty wears off, it’s not much different than sucking up a burp. But maybe I was just in a bad mood around that time. For whatever reason I was starting to have trouble sleeping, and I was making too many stupid mistakes at work. One day my boss stepped into my office and closed the door behind him. 



“Your performance is going to need to improve,” he said. “You used to be one of my top guys. Recently…” he paused, looking around the room as if searching for the right words. “It’s hard to say if you’re worth keeping around.”



That night she did it twice. The second was after I’d heard her snoring. I screamed so loud I’m surprised our neighbors didn’t wake up. 



Every time she did it I got a little more uncomfortable, but it was the one joke she had, and I’m sure she believed I thought it was hilarious. I didn’t want to dissuade her from being silly with me, but I was still in the process of working up the confidence to tell her that I wanted her to stop when we got into a bit of a disagreement one Friday night.



I had made reservations weeks in advance for a dinner to celebrate our monthly anniversary. She waited until an hour before we were supposed to leave to tell me that she was too tired to go.



I told her that was fine, but I’m sure she could tell from the annoyance in my voice that I was pissed. I mean, if you have an event planned weeks in advance, especially something like a dinner with your significant other, you think you’d be ready, right? Go to bed a little earlier the night before, grab a coffee or an energy drink. At the very least, she could tough it out for a couple hours to make me happy, right? 



“I just haven’t been getting enough yawnees recently,” she said.



I about lost my mind. “Can you cut it out with the crap?” I said. “It’s weird and disgusting. I just wanted to celebrate with you. Can’t we just try to have a good night?” 



She didn’t respond; she just stared at me with her eyes narrowed and her head tilted to the side. It was the look of someone who was about to lose it. I had opened my mouth to continue but faltered. Had I really made her that mad?



I went to our room and got in bed. I was too angry to sleep, but too tired to do anything else. I was laying there, thinking about all the things I might say to her, when I heard the door creak.



But no one was there. It must have been the wind or something. I hadn’t closed the door anyway, and I couldn’t tell whether or not it was more open than it was a few moments prior. I turned to face the wall and tried my best to fall asleep before she came to bed. As petty as it sounds, I was determined not to speak to her again for the rest of the night. 



After a few moments, I felt pressure in the back of my throat, then air filling up in my ears as my jaw began to tingle. I opened my mouth, right at the faint beginning of an inhale, Jamie slid out from under the bed, swiftly shifted to a sitting position, and put her mouth up against mine, sucking the remnants of a yawn halted by a scream out of my throat.



“What the fuck?!” I pushed myself to the middle of the bed.



“I got your yawnee!” She said, smiling.



“This is fucking insane!” I screamed. “What is wrong with you?”



I was seething with rage. I gripped the comforter with both hands so hard that my nails dug into my palms through the fabric. Jamie ignored me; she got into her side of the bed and was sleeping shortly after. I barely closed my eyes for the rest of the night.



We ignored each other over the weekend, and I made sure to hide my yawns as much as I was able. On Sunday, after walking into the bathroom and locking the door just to keep my yawn to myself, I looked at myself in the mirror. I hadn’t showered since Friday morning, and I’d only slept a couple hours since then. My hair was a greasy mess. There were thick, purple bags under my eyes.



I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was going to steal another yawn right when I least expected it. I didn’t want to let that happen, but at the same time, how could I be so ridiculous? Did it really matter?



My mistakes at work continued, and on Wednesday my boss put me on probation. Two days later, Jamie came home and told me that she’d won employee of the month. It came with a $2,000 bonus.



I was happy for her, and I took her out to dinner and a movie to celebrate. She laughed at all my cheesy jokes, and it felt like we were in the first month of our relationship again. It felt good to be on decent terms with her again. Was it really worth sacrificing my sleep, our relationship, and my job because I was scared she was going to steal my yawn?



When we got home we sat down on the couch to watch a movie. She snuggled up against me. “Robert,” she said, then paused for a moment. “I… I love you.”



“I love you too.”



It felt like she was building up to an apology but never quite got there. She’s always been an awkward person. It made sense that she was too embarrassed to admit that she took the joke too far. I could tell by the way she smiled at me that she felt horrible. But… I still wasn’t sure. The only way to be sure, to bring things back to normal, was to yawn in front of her. Once I was certain that she wasn’t going to steal my yawn, I could relax; I could sleep; I could trust her again. I know it seems silly, but I felt like this was what I needed to get my life back.



I opened my mouth and let out a loud yawn.



She slipped out from under my arm, enveloped my mouth with hers, and sucked it out of me like a hungry snake.



“I got your yawnee!” she squealed. She smiled at me, looking directly into my eyes from only a few inches away, then sat back against the couch and leaned her head against my shoulder.



For a moment the world seemed frozen. The movie was muffled; I could no longer feel Jamie on my side. Was this a dream? 



I closed my eyes and began counting to 10. Halfway through I realized that I’d been holding my breath. When I opened my eyes I jerked away from her and went to bed.



I laid there thinking about our relationship and how to get out of it. We had just renewed a 13-month lease together. And how could I explain to anyone that I was leaving her because she wouldn’t stop stealing my yawns? 



When she got into bed I locked myself in the guest bathroom and cried. I spent the night in the tub with a bath towel. I’m not sure if I ever fell asleep, but it couldn’t have been for more than two or three hours. 



I waited until I heard Jamie leave to unlock the door. I was twenty minutes late to work. That was strike one for the day.



Strike two was when my boss surprised me in my office and I spilled my cup of coffee all over his new suit.



“Jesus Christ!” He screamed and jumped backwards, slamming against my desk and sending my lamp to the floor. He reached toward his suit to wipe the scalding hot coffee off his hands, then thought better and started wiping them off on my desk. “This is a $4,000 suit,” he continued. “What the fuck is your problem?” He stuck the side of his thumb in his mouth as he left the room.



I tried to stay on my A-game for the rest of the day. I didn’t leave my office again except to go to the bathroom. Even then, I first peeked my head around my office door like a sly criminal to make sure the coast was clear.



Things were going better until about 3:00 PM, but I’m still not sure exactly what happened. I was doing some mundane task, inputting invoice numbers or something, when suddenly someone was nudging me from behind.



I woke up with my head pressed against the keyboard and about a thousand w’s entered where a number was supposed to be.



“Strike three,” my boss said. “Get your stuff and get out of here.”



When I got home I paced the living room, waiting for Jamie. 6:00 PM came, 30 minutes late. 6:05… I was just about to call her when she walked through the door carrying a bottle of wine. She was smiling wide and practically jumping up and down. I swear I’d never seen her so happy.



“I got promoted to team lead!” she said.



“How much is the raise?” I asked. I couldn’t look at her.



“It’s an extra $20,000 a year!



“Then we’re only down about 30.”



“What do you mean?” She asked.



I told her everything, and by the end of it I was crying in her arms. I was so comforted by the way she held me. She made me feel that everything was going to be okay. I cried until I had nothing left to give. 



“I’m just so tired,” I said, pleading as if she could fix me.



“I know,” she said. “I know. Just relax and let it happen.”



My eyes closed; a warm sensation ran through my body. Jamie patted my back as my mouth opened reflexively.



And then the disgusting, slurping sound. Droplets of spit flying from her mouth into mine. I didn’t fight it. Just cried and let myself fall further against her.



“It’s okay baby,” she said. “I’ll take care of you.” She kissed me on my forehead. “As long as you keep letting me have your yawnees.”



We fell asleep on the couch together. In the morning she went to work and I stayed home feeling sorry for myself. As the hours went by and I did nothing except scroll Instagram on my phone, I felt more and more of the realization that Jamie now owned me. I might as well have been a puppy in a kennel.



She would come home from work every day ready to take my yawns. Although I thought I’d have more energy now that I didn’t have to work, I found myself to be more tired than ever. When she was gone, all I could do was lay in bed, on the couch, or in the bath. When she got home she’d take a yawn, cook dinner, then take one more before bed. It became a Pavlovian response for me. When she walked toward me I would tingle, and when she opened her mouth in front of mine I’d give in instantaneously.



As the days went on I became worse, and time started to warp in odd ways. One moment we’d be eating dinner, the next she’d be coming home from work. One night, we went to bed watching our favorite show,  and when I woke up I was at the kitchen table with a half-eaten waffle in front of me. I dropped the fork I’d been holding and screamed.



“What’s wrong?” Jamie asked. She looked at me with her head tilted to the side. It would have been genuine concern if it wasn’t for the slight smile.



The more I thought about it the more I could faintly remember Jamie nudging me awake and leading me to the kitchen table. “I… I must have zoned out.”



I looked up and was surprised to see her wearing a robe. “Aren’t you supposed to be at work?”



“It’s Saturday, honey. Now give me a yawnee.”



She sucked it out of my mouth, but I barely noticed; I was thinking about something else. 



How could it be Saturday when we’d fallen asleep watching our show? The one that played on Monday nights.



As if my noticing flipped an invisible switch, it only got worse. One day it was nearly 100 degrees outside, the next it was snowing. I checked my phone one evening to see a text from my mom.



*I can’t believe you missed the funeral.*



There was beating in my throat. My body tingled in a strange, unpleasant way; I scrolled through the rest of our messages. Most recent were several texts all asking where I was. One telling me she hated me, one telling me she loved me.



I found a long paragraph that I’d written. It was about my dad and a memory of us fishing; one message from my mom said that she didn’t know how to move on without him. 



I couldn’t breathe. I got up out of bed, watched my feet as I walked toward the kitchen. The carpet turned to wood, then there was a dirty rug I didn’t recognize. I tried to kick it; instead I tripped and fell.



“What are you doing on the floor, honey?” Jamie asked, as if she hadn’t seen me.



“My dad… why, why wasn’t I at the funeral?”



“Don’t you remember, honey? You had to stay home and give me your yawnees. Like you promised.” 



She looked back down at her notebook and continued to write by hand, humming something I didn’t recognize.



I stood up and turned in a circle. Looking, looking, looking. My eyes found something sharp. A beautiful knife with a pink blade. I don’t remember what I did, but I remember that it felt good.



I haven’t slept since then, but I have more energy than ever. I don’t know what will happen next, but I do know one thing.

So here is where the confusion starts. So I drove back home and was the one to text him first. \*I\* told him that I had a good time and asked if he made it home okay.

He had a vasectomy scheduled for this Friday and he said ""Yes I wanna meet again. Lets figure something out after my big surgery and see how im doing lol"".

What you need:
• 1 whole egg
• 1 egg white
• ½ cup canned tuna (drained, about 85 g)
• ½ cup broccoli (boiled until soft)
• A small handful of spinach (boiled)
• 2 baby carrots (boiled and sliced)
• 2 small tomatoes (sliced)
• 2 tsp pickled onion juice
• Spices for the egg: paprika, garlic powder, black pepper, or whatever you like
 -  Optional: squeeze of lemon or hot sauce

How I make it:

Step 1. Boil your veggies first so they’re soft and easy to roll. Slice the grape tomatoes in half.

Step 2.	Whisk the whole egg and egg white in a small bowl, season it however you like. Heat a nonstick pan and pour the egg mixture in, spreading it thin like a little sheet. Cook until it’s set but still bendy.

Step 3.	Mix the drained tuna with the pickled onion juice. I sometimes throw in extra spices for a punch.

Step 4.	Lay your cooked egg flat, spread the tuna down the center, and stack the veggies on top. Roll it up like a mini burrito or fold it in half.

Step 5.	Optional extras: a little lemon or hot sauce makes it pop. I usually just pair it with water or black coffee.

piper chapman 👉🏼 instead of drifting aimlessly post-prison, piper takes her time to rebuild. she becomes an advocate for women like the ones she left behind, speaking out about the corruption she witnessed in the private prison system. she doesn’t become famous or rich off it, but she writes essays and speaks at universities, and it feels meaningful. she and alex don’t crash and burn — instead, they choose not to marry yet, but to actually build a foundation outside of the chaos of prison. piper is finally forced to stop being the center of her own story and learns how to uplift others, giving her life a quiet dignity she never had inside.

alex vause 👉🏼 alex doesn’t get stuck in prison forever while piper runs free. in this ending, alex gets early release through a compassionate plea deal (helped by her lawyer skills and the fact she’d already served so much time). on the outside, she opens a small, grungy bookstore/coffee shop in new york — nothing glamorous, but it’s stable, hers, and it’s legal. the shop becomes a safe spot for queer kids, misfits, and even ex-cons looking for a fresh start. she still struggles with her instincts to lie and manipulate, but alex finally channels her cunning into protecting her own world instead of destroying it.

suzanne “crazy eyes” warren 👉🏼 suzanne doesn’t end up abandoned in prison, confused and infantilized forever. in this version, she finally gets proper mental health support. she earns an early release into a halfway program where she has real therapy, a stable routine, and access to creative outlets. suzanne writes children’s books based on the stories she told in prison — her strange, magical imagination finally embraced instead of punished. she maintains contact with taystee, nicky, and even piper, who check in often. suzanne’s life becomes one of color, art, and warmth, proving she was never “crazy” — she was just never given the care she deserved.

taystee jefferson 👉🏼 taystee’s real ending was one of the cruelest. instead, in this version, the court finally recognizes the corruption of MCC and Caputo testifies on her behalf, exposing the cover-up of piscatella’s death. taystee is exonerated and released. she doesn’t magically forget her pain, but she pours herself into reform work, carrying poussey’s spirit with her. she helps run the Poussey Fund, speaking to young people about the pipeline from foster care to prison, showing them they do have another path. she finally has a home, a purpose, and a family built from her sisters on the inside.

poussey washington 👉🏼 poussey lives. during the protest in season 4, instead of suffocating, she’s knocked unconscious but survives. the moment is still horrifying and sparks national outrage, but poussey wakes up in a hospital, and her father fights for her release. with taystee’s help, she starts the Poussey Washington Fund herself, turning her trauma into something life-changing for other inmates. she travels, she works in publishing like she always dreamed, and she and soso reunite outside, giving both of them a second chance. poussey remains the heart of the story, her joy and freedom becoming the symbol of hope the prison always tried to crush.

daya diaz 👉🏼 instead of slipping deeper into violence, daya breaks the cycle. after her overdose scare, she’s transferred into a long-term rehab program within the prison system. she reconnects with her siblings and begins writing letters to her daughter, apologizing, explaining, promising she’ll be better. when she’s eventually released, she joins her mother in running a small community outreach program for young women in the bronx. it’s messy, not glamorous, but for the first time in her life, daya isn’t someone else’s pawn — she’s in control of her story.

aleida diaz 👉🏼 instead of repeating her mistakes, aleida realizes how much she failed as a mom. she gets a job (maybe running a salon) and becomes a tough-love but reliable guardian for daya’s kids. her redemption is not in a man, but in breaking generational cycles.

gloria mendoza 👉🏼 gloria’s ending deserved triumph. instead of being just another mother torn apart from her kids, she’s granted early release after her heroic efforts during the riot and her record of leadership. she opens a small restaurant in queens, a place filled with loud laughter, bachata on the radio, and food that tastes like home. her daughters work alongside her, and gloria becomes what she always wanted to be — a provider, a protector, a matriarch whose sacrifices finally mean something.

maritza ramos 👉🏼 instead of vanishing into deportation with no justice, maritza gets a miracle — a lawyer takes on her case after seeing her video go viral, and she’s granted daca protections. she comes back stronger, enrolling in cosmetology school and turning her love of glamour into a business. she becomes a makeup artist for quinceañeras and weddings, known for her charm and kindness. she never forgets the women she left behind, and she uses her platform to fight for immigration reform, laughing through the pain like she always did.

flaca gonzalez 👉🏼 instead of being left in despair after maritza disappears, flaca finds strength in music and storytelling. she starts a prison radio program where inmates share their stories, their songs, their truths. when she’s released, she turns it into a podcast that takes off — “voices from the inside.” she reunites with maritza one day at an event, and their hug is long, tearful, and filled with unspoken forgiveness. flaca, once the sarcastic class clown, finally learns her voice can change things.

maria ruiz 👉🏼 maria doesn’t fade into bitterness. after the riot fallout, she becomes a leader in restorative justice programs inside prison. she mentors younger inmates, teaching them resilience, helping them avoid the traps she fell into. when she’s released, she rebuilds her relationship with her daughter slowly, one visit, one phone call, one awkward laugh at a time. maria’s ending isn’t perfect, but it’s honest — a woman scarred but unbroken, fighting to make her family whole again.

lorna morello 👉🏼 instead of spiraling into full delusion, lorna finally gets the mental health support she always needed. therapy uncovers the loneliness at her core, and slowly, she learns to live without fantasy. when she gives birth, her baby is placed with a loving adoptive family she chooses herself — a family who promises to let her stay connected in some way. lorna spends her remaining sentence creating art, writing long letters to her son, and in the end, she leaves prison with a fragile but real sense of self. she no longer needs a perfect love story — she finally learns she’s enough.

norma romano 👉🏼 instead of remaining a silent enigma, norma finds her own voice. literally. during a prison event, she speaks a few words, shaky but powerful, and the women who once saw her as a saint cheer her on as simply human. she begins leading meditation classes, guiding others through their pain with quiet strength. when she’s released, she builds a small community center for women, filled with crystals, incense, and the same calm presence she carried in prison. she’s not a god — she’s proof that gentleness can survive anywhere.

big boo 👉🏼 boo doesn’t just vanish into the system — she becomes a legend. she turns her humor and wit into a survival tool, running comedy nights inside prison that keep the women laughing even in the darkest moments. when she’s released, she becomes a stand-up comedian, brutally honest about her past and proudly unapologetic about who she is. she doesn’t conform, doesn’t soften her edges, and yet somehow finds love in a way she never expected. boo becomes what she always claimed to be: unforgettable.

doggett (pennsatucky) 👉🏼 instead of dying alone after an overdose, tiffany’s ending is rewritten with grace. she passes her ged test, and her joy is radiant, unmatched. she’s transferred to a halfway house where she works with kids who’ve faced addiction and poverty. she becomes a mentor, someone who understands pain but also knows the way through it. in her later years, she starts telling her story on stages — a woman who was once written off as nothing more than “trailer trash,” now a living testament to resilience.

brook soso 👉🏼 after poussey lives in this rewrite, soso leaves prison with her, and they become activists together. she heals from her depression through building something meaningful with poussey. 

janae watson 👉🏼 instead of being punished into silence, janae finds a mentor in taystee, who helps her fight for her education inside. she starts running the prison track program, teaching other girls to love running the way she once did. after release, she gets a scholarship through a reentry program and finally goes to college — studying kinesiology and becoming a track coach. her story isn’t about wasted potential anymore — it’s about potential finally realized.

cindy “black cindy” 👉🏼 instead of being estranged from her daughter, cindy rebuilds that relationship after release. she works a steady job, makes peace with her mom, and steps into adulthood with humility.

red reznikov 👉🏼 red deserved better than dementia in a cell. in the alternative, red is released on compassionate grounds due to her health. nikki fights hard to get her out and succeeds. red lives her last years in a modest apartment above a russian deli in brooklyn, where she cooks again for family — nikki, lorna’s child, and anyone who needs a “home.” she finds peace knowing she didn’t lose her identity to prison walls, and her ending is about dignity and love rather than erasure.

nikki nichols 👉🏼 instead of watching her spiral endlessly, nicky steps into her role as the true “heir” to red’s legacy. she finishes her sentence and leaves prison with a stronger backbone, determined not to waste the chance red gave her. she becomes a counselor for recovering addicts, brutally honest but deeply compassionate — because she gets it. when she tells young people “don’t waste your shot,” they actually listen, because she’s raw and real. nicky stays clean, but she never becomes boring — she carries her wit, her heart, and her scars proudly.

sophia burset 👉🏼 sophia doesn’t fade into the background after being released early. instead, she uses her payout from the lawsuit to open a salon that specifically caters to trans women and formerly incarcerated people. she becomes a community icon, using her strength and elegance to fight for lgbt rights. her relationship with her son grows stronger, and he finally understands the sacrifices she made to be her authentic self. sophia, once so defined by survival, finally gets to thrive.

yoga jones 👉🏼 yoga jones doesn’t fade into the background of orange. instead, she becomes a quiet anchor for the women around her, teaching yoga and meditation but also sharing her story of guilt and grief with honesty. she learns forgiveness isn’t a one-time act — it’s a lifelong practice. when she leaves prison, she retreats into the woods, opening a small yoga studio where women who’ve lived through trauma come to heal. her life becomes less about her own pain and more about guiding others through theirs.

tricia miller 👉🏼 instead of dying from an overdose and being written off, trish’s story takes a turn when nicky notices her spiraling during withdrawal. nicky sneaks her help, and trish is placed in a real rehab program inside prison. it’s not easy — she relapses, struggles, and screams, but she finally gets proper care and guidance. she becomes a mentor for other inmates battling addiction, using her humor and vulnerability to connect with them. when she’s released, trish walks out with a small backpack and a journal full of poems, sketches, and letters from the women she helped. she moves into a halfway house, finds part-time work at a music store, and slowly begins to rebuild her life. for the first time, she feels hope that isn’t fleeting — she’s alive, she’s seen, and she has a future.

claudette 👉🏼 instead of fading into obscurity as a background enforcer in the prison, claudette finds purpose. after realizing that the cycle of intimidation and violence only isolates her, she joins a vocational program teaching other inmates self-defense and personal safety in a structured, nonviolent way. she earns respect not through fear, but through guidance and discipline. when released, she opens a self-defense and fitness studio in her neighborhood, empowering women and teens. her presence is commanding, but now it’s paired with compassion and mentorship. claudette’s ending is one of quiet strength — she doesn’t have to terrorize anyone to be feared, she earns respect because she deserves it.

i know it’s not realistic, but i would’ve loved to see restoration, healing, and justice. not perfect fairy tales, but endings where the pain wasn’t for nothing. they deserved more than tragedy or to be forgotten.

1mz4dhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/1mz4dhr/anybody_also_having_the_combo_of_a_liver/,Anybody also having the combo of a Liver transplant and CU?,"

Heya!

I had a liver transplant in 2017 due to my autoimmunehepatitis and everything had been going well until 2023 when I suddenly showed symptoms of colitis. Luckily I could go to my gastroenterologist asap and got the CU diagnosis the same week. It was probably the worst time of my life and I would even say my liver transplant was a piece of cake in comparison to 20 painful bowel movements a day :’D

I’m just so confused that I developed CU even tho I had been under quite some immunosuppressants (Tacrolimus, Azathioprin, Prednisolone). My doctor told me I might have had it my whole life but it just never flared up. Which I find interesting because a month prior to the first flare my boyfriend broke up with me and I think it might have triggered it (it was a big heartbreak haha)

I got 3g mesalazine a day as “basic” treatment now next to the immunosuppressant that I take anyways and I haven’t had a flare ever since, which I am grateful for. My doctor suggested switching Azathioprin with Remicade once but I was like “why change it when it works?”. And I’m not even sure if Remicade would work in the same ways Azathioprin does for my autoimmune hepatitis.

I take 50mg Azathioprin a day which I believe is a “low” dose for CU standards right?

I’m not used to a CU diagnosis so since I’ve been feeling better I just go on with my diet as I have been before and I’m absolutely fine. (My coffee addiction especially)

So by any chance is anybody also having this kind of medication combination of Mesalazine, Azathioprin and Tacrolimus and might share how it works for them?

So I stumbled upon this sub and I’m a decaf person but not in the same way as many of you. 

I have never had a sip of coffee, in my life. 

Not once. 

I’m 26 now but since I was a child the smell of it made me nauseous so I always stayed away. 

I like tea, but I mainly drink peppermint tea or chamomile, both of which are obviously decaffeinated. 

I remember in my early 20s trying green tea at a Chinese restaurant and it kept me up the whole night so I’ve never touched it after that. I do on rare occasions drink English breakfast tea but this is like a few times a year and even then I reach for decaffeinated where possible. 

Many people find it crazy and I’m always met with disbelief when I tell them I don’t drink coffee. Even worse is when I’m with friends who order a coffee/matcha and I just go for hot chocolate. Even the server is like, “…are you sure?”

I’m generally a very sleepy and tired person. I do struggle to get through the afternoons sometimes after lunch. But I mostly fall asleep the moment my head hits the pillow at night. I’ve been on and off with anxiety/stress, but it’s mostly around stressful situations in the moment or fear of the future. 

So I guess I’m just curious, what does it feel like to be caffeinated? Am I missing out?",1,1756062280.0,decaf,6,1.0,False
1mz4c0t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mz4c0t,"Qwen vs Chroma HD, round 2 : photographic style","Hello,

I am doing the second part of the Qwen test I started here : [https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1myshf7/qwen\_vs\_chroma\_hd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1myshf7/qwen_vs_chroma_hd/) 

This time, I try photorealistic prompts. I suppose it will downvoted the same as part 1, so I'll start by covering the question for gooners: while Chroma has a better rendering of anatomy and notably sexual organs, it isn't the be all and end all of porn model. 

  
And I got body horror a few times even with Chroma. 

  
Now, for regular people, let's try photographic images. The negative prompts is empty with Qwen and with a few default keywords for Chroma.

  
**Prompt 1 : detective's office**

  
*The style is photographic. A smoky 1930s detective’s office, heavy with atmosphere. At the center, a seasoned commissioner leans back in his chair, suspenders stretched over his shirt, a cigar glowing between his fingers. His polished shoes rest casually on the desk, which is cluttered with papers, a rotary phone, and a half-empty glass of whiskey. Light filters through venetian blinds, cutting the room into sharp stripes of shadow and glow, giving the air a noir tension. In front of him, a young brunette woman sits on a simple chair, elegantly dressed in period attire with matching shoes, hairstyle, and a small handbag resting on her lap. Her expression carries a mix of worry and determination as she speaks, while the commissioner listens in silence, eyes narrowed beneath the haze of smoke. The overall mood should evoke classic film noir: intimate, tense, filled with chiaroscuro lighting, and rich with the subtle drama of an unfolding secret.*

  
Chroma has problems with details (hands, holding a cigar correctly) and surprisingly is slightly worse at faces. 



**Prompt 2 : adobe desert lodge**

  
*A serene adobe lodge in the middle of the Sahara desert, its sandy walls blending with the golden dunes. In front of the building, a turquoise swimming pool reflects the blazing sun, creating a striking contrast with the arid landscape. Two young women in bikinis recline on wooden lounge chairs by the pool, enjoying the calm, with wide-brimmed hats and cocktails on a small side table. The lodge has large glass doors that open onto the terrace, revealing glimpses of the interior: cool shaded rooms with Berber carpets, low wooden tables, woven lampshades, and colorful cushions scattered over white plaster benches. The architecture is simple and elegant, with soft rounded adobe forms and earthy textures. Palm trees and a few desert plants surround the pool, adding a touch of green to the scene. The overall mood should convey quiet luxury, warmth, and a sense of tranquil escape in a timeless desert oasis.*

  
Both models do well here, with more variety in point of view for Chroma. 

  
**Prompt 3 : office view**

*A lively modern office scene, viewed from a three-quarter high angle, giving a clear perspective of the entire space. At one desk, two people sit side by side working on their computers, focused on their screens. Nearby, three colleagues stand in front of a large whiteboard covered in sketches and notes, engaged in an animated discussion. On the right, a person is just stepping through a doorway, captured mid-movement as they leave the room. In the background, a technician kneels beside a water fountain, tools spread on the floor as he repairs it. The office is bright and open, with natural light filtering in through large windows, desks arranged with laptops, notepads, and coffee cups. Details like office chairs, potted plants, and casual clothing should emphasize a contemporary, collaborative workplace atmosphere. The elevated viewpoint should allow all actions to be visible in one dynamic, storytelling composition.*

  
Chroma loses on number of characters and composition, even though the picture seems more office-like.

**Prompt 4 : clash of swords**

*Two warriors face each other in a dramatic clash, their swords colliding in a burst of sparks that illuminate the scene with raw energy. On one side, a Greek hoplite stands in bronze armor, a plumed Corinthian helmet casting sharp shadows across his face. His round shield is raised, and his short xiphos sword meets his opponent’s blade with a violent impact. Opposite him, a fierce Viking fighter pushes forward, clad in chainmail with fur accents, a horned leather helmet framing his determined gaze. His longsword arcs through the air, striking with brutal force against the hoplite’s weapon. Dust and grit scatter at their feet as the clash reverberates, while the background suggests a timeless battlefield—blurred banners, rough stone, and a sky heavy with tension. The mood is epic and mythic, a frozen instant of history colliding, where sparks of steel hint at the meeting of two cultures across time.*

While Qwen is very subpar with weapons, Chroma does worse (merging sword and hand more often than not) and, surprisingly, get a more plasticky result for this scene. 

  
**Prompt 5 : the investigators**

*The style is photographic. Inside a dimly lit cabinet of curiosities, a 1920s scholar in round glasses and tweed jacket stands before a heavy lectern, carefully studying a large ancient grimoire. The yellowed pages glow faintly under the warm light of a desk lamp, casting long shadows across shelves crowded with peculiar artifacts: a human brain floating in a jar, taxidermy specimens, mechanical contraptions, and strange devices of unknown origin. Behind him, a detective in a fedora and trench coat observes with a skeptical gaze, arms crossed, his presence solid and pragmatic. Beside him, a sharp-eyed journalist, dressed in period attire with notepad and pencil in hand, leans forward eagerly, ready to capture every detail. The atmosphere is tense and mysterious, mixing the intellectual rigor of scholarship with the thrill of investigation. The cluttered, eclectic room should feel immersive, rich in textures and details, evoking a scene of discovery at the intersection of science, myth, and intrigue.*

I have no idea why Qwen made large black bands around the image this time. Chroma also dropped the photographic style. I'd still give the point to Chroma here.   


**Prompt 6 : the mandatory 1girl**

  
*The style is photographic. Depict a young French girl around 20 years old, with balanced, harmonious features that still retain a hint of youthful softness. Her face is oval, with smooth skin and lightly defined cheekbones that give her a graceful structure without harshness. Her eyes are large, deep brown, bright with intelligence and curiosity, framed by refined eyebrows that arch naturally. Her nose is straight and proportionate, accentuated by a small, elegant nose piercing that conveys confidence and individuality. Her lips are well-shaped, fine but expressive, often suggesting determination or subtle warmth in her expression. Her hair is thick and slightly wavy, light brown with golden highlights, cascading around her shoulders in natural, loose strands. The overall impression should evoke a modern young woman at the threshold of adulthood—fresh, confident, and self-possessed—captured in a timeless, realistic style with a touch of quiet elegance.*

To be honest here I reran the generation after the first where Chroma didn't make a photo. 

I didn't find it any less plasticky than base flux, though, and the benefit of variation wasn't that great, even if Qwen is nearly doing 4 pictures of the exact same girl.

  There are so many unspoken rules when you live here, like the way you’re never supposed to stop in the middle of the sidewalk or stare dreamily up at tall buildings or pause to read graffiti. No giant folding maps, no fanny packs, no eye contact. No humming songs from Dear Evan Hansen in public. And you’re definitely not supposed to take selfies at street corners, even if there’s a hot dog stand and a whole line of yellow taxis in the background, which is eerily how you always pictured New York. You’re allowed to silently appreciate it, but you have to be cool. From what I can tell, that’s the whole point of New York: being cool.  
  
  I’m not cool.  
  
  Take this morning. I made the mistake of glancing up at the sky, just for a moment, and now I can’t unstick my eyes. Looking up from this angle, it’s like the world’s tipping inward: dizzyingly tall buildings and a bright fireball sun.  
  
  It’s beautiful. I’ll give New York credit for that. It’s beautiful and surreal, and absolutely nothing like Georgia. I tilt my phone to snap a picture. Not an Instagram Story, no filters. Nothing drawn-out.  
  
  One tiny, quick picture.  
  
  Instantaneous pedestrian rage: Jesus. Come on. MOVE. Fucking tourists. Literally, I take a two-second photograph, and now I’m obstruction personified. I’m responsible for every subway delay, every road closure, the very phenomenon of wind resistance.  
  
  Fucking tourists.  
  
  I’m not even a tourist. I somewhat live here, at least for the summer. It’s not like I’m taking a joyful sightseeing stroll at noon on a Monday. I’m at work. I mean, I’m on a Starbucks run, but it counts.  
  
  And maybe I’m taking the long way. Maybe I need a few extra minutes away from Mom’s office. Normally, being an intern is more boring than terrible, but today’s uniquely shitty. You know that kind of day where the printer runs out of paper, and there’s none in the supply room, so you try to steal some from the copier, but you can’t get the drawer open, and then you push some wrong button and the copier starts beeping? And you’re standing there thinking that whoever invented copy machines is this close to getting their ass kicked? By you? By a five-foot-six Jewish kid with ADHD and the rage of a tornado? That kind of day? Yeah.  
  
  And all I want to do is vent to Ethan and Jessie, but I still haven’t figured out how to text while walking.  
  
  I step off the sidewalk, near the entrance to a post office—and wow. They don’t make post offices like this in Milton, Georgia. It’s got a white stone exterior with pillars and brass accents, and it’s so painfully classy, I almost feel underdressed. And I’m wearing a tie.  
  
  I text the sunny street picture to Ethan and Jessie. Rough day at the office!  
  
  Jessie writes back immediately. I hate you and I want to be you.  
  
  Here’s the thing: Jessie and Ethan have been my best friends since the dawn of time, and I’ve always been Real Arthur with them. Lonely Messy Arthur, as opposed to Upbeat Instagram Arthur. But for some reason, I need them to think my New York life is awesome. I just do. So I’ve been sending them Upbeat Instagram Arthur texts for weeks. I don’t know if I’m really selling it, though.  
  
  Also I miss you, Jessie writes, throwing down a whole line of kissy emojis. She’s like my bubbe in a sixteen-year-old body. She’d text a lipstick smudge onto my cheek if she could. The weird thing is that we’ve never had one of those ooey-gooey friendships—at least not until prom night. Which happens to be the night I told Jessie and Ethan I’m gay.  
  
  I miss you guys, too, I admit.  
  
  COME HOME, ARTHUR.  
  
  Four more weeks. Not that I’m counting.  
  
  Ethan finally chimes in with the most ambiguous of all emojis: the grimace. Like, come on. The grimace? If post-prom Jessie texts like my bubbe, post-prom Ethan texts like a mime. He’s actually not so bad in the group text most of the time, but one-on-one? I’ll just say my phone stopped blowing up with his texts approximately five seconds after I came out. I’m not going to lie: it’s the crappiest feeling ever. One of these days, I’m going to call him out, and it’s going to be soon. Maybe even today. Maybe—  
  
  But then the post office door swings open, revealing—no joke—a pair of identical twin men in matching rompers. With handlebar mustaches. Ethan would love this. Which pisses me off. This happens constantly with Ethan. A minute ago, I was ready to friend-dump his emojily ambiguous ass. Now I just want to hear him laugh. A full emotional one-eighty in a span of sixty seconds.  
  
  The twins amble past me, and I see they both have man buns. Of course they have man buns. New York must be its own planet, I swear, because no one even blinks.  
  
  Except.  
  
  There’s a boy walking toward the entrance, holding a cardboard box, and he literally stops in his tracks when the twins walk by. He looks so confused, I laugh out loud.  
  
  And then he catches my eye.  
  
  And then he smiles.  
  
  And holy shit.  
  
  I mean it. Holy mother of shit. Cutest boy ever. Maybe it’s the hair or the freckles or the pinkness of his cheeks. And I say this as someone who’s never noticed another person’s cheeks in my life. But his cheeks are worth noticing. Everything about him is worth noticing. Perfectly rumpled light brown hair. Fitted jeans, scuffed shoes, gray shirt—with the words Dream & Bean Coffee barely visible above the box he’s holding. He’s taller than me—which, okay, most guys are.  
  
  He’s still looking at me.  
  
  But twenty points to Gryffindor, because  
I manage to smile up at him. “Do you think they parked their tandem bicycle at the mustache-wax parlor?”  
  
  His startled laugh is so cute, it makes me light-headed. “Definitely the mustache-wax parlor slash art gallery slash microbrewery,” he says.  
  
  For a minute, we grin at each other without speaking.  
  
  “Um, are you going in?” he asks finally.  
  
  I glance up at the door. “Yeah.”  
  
  And I do it. I follow him into the post office. It’s not even a decision. Or if it is, my body’s already decided. There’s something about him. It’s this tug in my chest. It’s this feeling like I have to know him, like it’s inevitable.  
  
  Okay, I’m about to admit something, and you’re probably going to cringe. You’re probably already cringing, but whatever. Hear me out.  
  
  I believe in love at first sight. Fate, the universe, all of it. But not how you’re thinking. I don’t mean it in the our souls were split and you’re my other half forever and ever sort of way. I just think you’re meant to meet some people. I think the universe nudges them into your path.  
  
  Even on random Monday afternoons in July. Even at the post office.  
  
  But let’s be real—this is no normal post office. It’s big enough to be a ballroom, with gleaming floors and rows of numbered PO boxes and actual sculptures, like a museum. Box Boy walks over to a short counter near the entrance, props the package beside him, and starts filling out a mailing label.  
  
  So I swipe a Priority Mail envelope from a nearby rack and drift toward his counter. Super casual. This doesn’t have to be weird. I just need to find the perfect words to keep this conversation going. To be honest, I’m normally really good at talking to strangers. I don’t know if it’s a Georgia thing or only an Arthur thing, but if there’s an elderly man in a grocery store, I’m there price-checking prune juices for him. If there’s a pregnant lady on an airplane, she’s named her unborn kid after me by the time the plane lands. It’s the one thing I have going for me.  
  
  Or I did, until today. I don’t even think I can form sounds. It’s like my throat’s caving in on itself. But I have to channel my inner New Yorker—cool and nonchalant. I shoot him a tentative grin. Deep breath. “That’s a big package.”  
  
  And . . . shit.  
  
  The words tumble out. “I don’t mean package. Just. Your box. Is big.” I hold my hands apart to demonstrate. Because apparently that’s the way to prove it’s not an innuendo. By spreading my hands out dick-measuringly.  
  
  Box Boy furrows his brow.  
  
  “Sorry. I don’t . . . I swear I don’t usually comment on the size of other guys’ boxes.”  
  
  He meets my eyes and smiles, just a little. “Nice tie,” he says.  
  
  I look down at it, blushing. Of course I couldn’t have worn a normal tie today. Nope. I’m wearing one from the Dad collection. Navy blue, printed with hundreds of tiny hot dogs.  
  
  “At least it’s not a romper?” I say.  
  
  “Good point.” He smiles again—so of course I notice his lips. Which are shaped exactly like Emma Watson’s lips. Emma Watson’s lips. Right there on his face.  
  
  “So you’re not from here,” Box Boy says.  
  
  I look up at him, startled. “How did you know?”  
  
  “Well, you keep talking to me.” Then he blushes. “That came out wrong. I just mean it’s usually only tourists who strike up conversations.”  
  
  “Oh.”  
  
  “I don’t mind, though,” he says.  
  
  “I’m not a tourist.”  
  
  “You’re not?”  
  
  “Okay, I’m not technically from here, but I live here now. Just for the summer. I’m from Milton, Georgia.”  
  
  “Milton, Georgia.” He smiles.  
  
  I feel inexplicably frantic. Like, my limbs are weird and loose, and my head’s full of cotton. I’m probably electric bright red now. I don’t even want to know. I just need to keep talking. “I know, right? Milton. It sounds like a Jewish great-uncle.”  
  
  “I wasn’t—”  
  
  “I actually do have a Jewish great-uncle Milton. That’s whose apartment we’re staying in.”  
  
  “Who’s we?”  
  
  “You mean who do I live with in my great-uncle Milton’s apartment?”  
  
  He nods, and I just look at him. Like, who does he think I live with? My boyfriend? My twenty-eight-year-old smoldering-hot boyfriend who has big gaping holes in his earlobes and maybe a tongue piercing and a tattoo of my name on his pec? On both pecs?  
  
  “With my parents,” I say quickly. “My mom’s a lawyer, and her firm has an office here, so she came up at the end of April for this case she’s working on, and I totally would have come up then, but my mom was like, Nice try, Arthur, you have a month of school left. But it ended up being for the best, because I guess I thought New York was going to be one thing, and it’s really another thing, and now I’m kind of stuck here, and I miss my friends, and I miss my car, and I miss Waffle House.”  
  
  “In that order?”  
  
  “Well, mostly the car.” I grin. “We left it at my bubbe’s house in New Haven. She lives right by Yale, which is hopefully, hopefully my future school. Fingers crossed.” It’s like I can’t stop talking. “I guess you probably don’t need my life story.”  
  
  “I don’t mind.” Box Boy pauses, balancing the box on his hip. “Want to get on line?”  
  
  I nod, falling into step behind him. He shifts sideways to face me, but the box looms between us. He hasn’t stuck the shipping label on yet. It’s sitting on top of the package. I try to sneak a peek at the address, but his handwriting sucks, and I can’t read upside down.  
  
  He catches me looking. “Are you really nosy or something?” He’s watching me through narrowed eyes.  
  
  “Oh.” I swallow. “Kind of. Yeah.”  
  
  That makes him smile. “It’s not that interesting. It’s leftovers from a breakup.”  
  
  “Leftovers?”  
  
  “Books, gifts, Harry Potter wand. Everything I don’t want to look at anymore.”  
  
  “You don’t want to look at a Harry Potter wand?”  
  
  “I don’t want to look at anything my ex-boyfriend gave me.”  
  
  Ex-boyfriend.  
  
  Which means Box Boy dates guys.  
  
  And okay. Wow. This doesn’t happen to me. It just doesn’t. But maybe the universe works differently in New York.  
  
  Box Boy dates guys.  
  
  I’M A GUY.  
  
  “That’s really cool,” I say. Perfectly casual. But then he looks at me funny, and my hand flies to my mouth. “Not cool. God. No. Breakups aren’t cool. I’m just—I’m so sorry for your loss.”  
  
  “He’s not dead.”  
  
  “Oh, right. Yeah. I’m gonna . . .” I exhale, hand resting for a moment on the retractable line barrier.  
  
  Box Boy smiles tightly. “Right. So you’re one of those guys who gets weird around gay dudes.”  
  
  “What?” I yelp. “No. Not at all.”  
  
  “Yeah.” He rolls his eyes, glancing over my shoulder.  
  
  “I’m not,” I say quickly. “Listen. I’m gay.”  
  
  And the whole world stops. My tongue feels thick and heavy.  
  
  I guess I don’t say those words out loud all that often. I’m gay. My parents know, Ethan and Jessie know, and I kind of randomly told the summer associates at Mom’s firm. But I’m not a person who goes around announcing it at the post office.  
  
  Except apparently, I kind of am.  
  
  “Oh. For real?” Box Boy asks.  
  
  “For real.” It comes out breathless. It’s weird—now I want to prove it. I want some gay ID card to whip out like a cop badge. Or I could demonstrate in other ways. God. I would happily demonstrate.  
  
  Box Boy smiles, his shoulders relaxing. “Cool.”  
  
  And holy shit. This is actually happening. I can hardly catch my breath. It’s like the universe willed this moment into existence.  
  
  A voice booms from behind the counter. “You on line or not?” I look up to see a woman with a lip ring raining down the stink-eye. No fucks given by this postal employee. “Yo, Freckles. Let’s go.”  
  
&  
nbsp; Box Boy shoots me a halting glance before stepping up to the counter. Already, there’s a line stretching out behind me. And okay—I’m not eavesdropping on Box Boy. Not exactly. It’s more like my ears are drawn to his voice. His arms are crossed, shoulders tense.  
  
  “Twenty-six fifty for Priority,” says Lip Ring.  
  
  “Twenty-six fifty? Like twenty-six dollars?”  
  
  “No. Like twenty-six fifty.”  
  
  Box Boy shakes his head. “That’s a lot.”  
  
  “That’s what we got. Take it or leave it.”  
  
  For a moment, Box Boy just stands there. Then he takes the box back, hugging it to his chest. “Sorry.”  
  
  “Next,” says Lip Ring. She beckons to me, but I swerve out of line.  
  
  Box Boy blinks. “How is it twenty-six fifty to send a package?”  
  
  “I don’t know. That’s messed up.”  
  
  “Guess that’s the universe saying I should hold on to it.”  
  
  The universe.  
  
  Holy shit.  
  
  He’s a believer. He believes in the universe. And I don’t want to jump to conclusions or anything, but Box Boy believing in the universe is definitely a sign from the universe.  
  
  “Okay.” My heartbeat quickens. “But what if the universe is actually telling you to throw his stuff away?”  
  
  “That’s not how it works.”  
  
  “Oh really?”  
  
  “Think about it. Getting rid of the box is plan A, right? The universe isn’t going to thwart plan A just so I’ll go with another version of plan A. This is clearly the universe calling for plan B.”  
  
  “And plan B is . . .”  
  
  “Accepting that the universe is an asshole—”  
  
  “The universe isn’t an asshole!”  
  
  “It is. Trust me.”  
  
  “How could you possibly know that?”  
  
  “I know the universe has some fucked-up plan for this box.”  
  
  “But that’s the thing!” I stare him down. “You don’t actually know. You have no idea where the universe is going with this. Maybe the whole reason you’re here is because the universe wanted you to meet me, so I could tell you to throw the box away.”  
  
  He smiles. “You think the universe wanted us to meet?”  
  
  “What? No! I mean, I don’t know. That’s the point. We have no way of knowing.”  
  
  “Well, I guess we’ll see how it plays out.” He peers at the shipping label for a moment and then rips it in half, wadding it and tossing it into the trash. At least he aims for the trash, but it lands on the floor. “Anyway,” he says. “Um, are you Excuse me.” A man’s voice reverberates through an intercom. “Can I have your attention?”  
  
  I glance sidelong at Box Boy. “Is this—”  
  
  There’s a sudden squeal of feedback and a rising piano intro.  
  
  And then a literal fucking marching band walks in.  
  
  A marching band.  
  
  People flood into the post office, carrying giant drums and flutes and tubas, blasting a somewhat off-key rendition of that Bruno Mars song “Marry You.” And now dozens of people—old people, people I thought were in line to buy stamps—have launched into a choreographed dance number, with high kicks and hip thrusts and shimmying arms. Basically everyone who’s not dancing is filming this, but I’m too stunned to even grab my phone. I mean, I don’t want to read too much into things, but wow: I meet a cute boy, and five seconds later, I’m in the middle of a flash mob marriage proposal? Could this message from the universe be any clearer?  
  
  The crowd parts, and a tattooed guy rolls in on a skateboard, skidding to a stop in front of the service desk. He’s holding a jewelry box, but instead of taking a knee, he plants his elbows on the counter and beams up at Lip Ring. “Kelsey. Babe. Will you marry me?”  
  
  Kelsey’s black mascara tracks all the way down to her lip ring. “Yes!” She grabs his face for a tear-soaked kiss, and the crowd erupts into cheers.  
  
  It hits me deep in my chest. It’s that New York feeling, like they talk about in musicals—that wide-open, top-volume, Technicolor joy. Here I’ve spent the whole summer moping around and missing Georgia, but it’s like someone just flipped a light switch inside of me.  
  
  I wonder if Box Boy feels it, too. I turn toward him, already smiling, and my hand’s pressed to my heart—  
  
  But he’s gone.  
  
  My hand falls limply. The boy is nowhere. His box is nowhere. I peer around, scanning every single face in the post office. Maybe he got pushed aside by the flash mob. Maybe he was part of the flash mob. Maybe he had some kind of urgent appointment—so urgent he couldn’t stop to get my number. He couldn’t even say goodbye.  
  
  I can’t believe he didn’t say goodbye.  
  
  I thought—I don’t know, it’s stupid, but I thought we had some kind of moment. I mean, the universe basically scooped us up and delivered us to each other. That’s what just happened, right? I don’t even know how else you could interpret it.  
  
  Except he vanished. He’s Cinderella at midnight. It’s like he never even existed. And now I’ll never know his name, or how my name sounds when he says it. I’ll never get to show him that the universe isn’t an asshole.  
  
  Gone. Totally gone. And the disappointment hits me so hard, I almost double over.  
  
  Until my eyes fall on the trash can.  
  
  Okay. I’m not saying I’m going to dig through the trash. Obviously not. I’m a mess, but I’m not that messy.  
  
  But maybe Box Boy is right. Maybe the universe is calling for plan B.  
  
  Here’s my question: If a piece of trash never makes it into a trash can, can you even call it trash? Because let’s just imagine—and this is totally hypothetical—let’s say there’s a crumpled shipping label on the floor. Is that trash?  
  
  What if it’s a glass slipper?  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  Ben  
  
  I’m back at the start.  
  
  I had one job. Mail the breakup box. Not run out of the post office with the breakup box. In my defense, there was a lot going on. There was that cool and cute Arthur guy, who clearly hasn’t been burned by the universe before, because he actually thought we were supposed to meet. On the day I was trying to mail Hudson’s things back to him. I’m sure Arthur is changing his tune about the universe after that marching band broke us apart.  
  
  I hop on the train and head back to Alphabet City to meet up with my best friend, Dylan. I live on Avenue B, Dylan lives on Avenue D. Our origin story comes down to our last names, Alejo and Boggs. He sat behind me in third grade and was nonstop tapping my shoulder to borrow everything, like pencils and loose-leaf. Same deal as we got older when he’d need my two-versions-behind-everyone-else iPhone to text his Crush of the Week after his own battery died. The only time I ever quote-unquote borrow something is when I need him to spot me some lunch money. And I say quote-unquote because it’s super rare that I can pay him back, and he doesn’t care. Dylan’s a good dude. He doesn’t care that I like guys and I don’t care that he likes girls. Shout-out to my main man the alphabet for this bromance.  
  
  When I get off the train, I stop at several trash cans, holding the breakup box over them, but I never catch that courage to actually dump the damn thing.  
  
  I guess I didn’t expect the breakup to suck if I did the breaking up. But since Hudson’s the one who kissed somebody else, it still feels like he really ended things. Things hadn’t been right between us since his parents got divorced, but I was patient with him. Like when I let him plan my birthday and he took me to a concert of his favorite band. But I let it go because it was my first-ever concert and the Killers are awesome. Then he didn’t show up to my parents’ big anniversary lunch. I let it go again because celebrating my parents’ marriage after everything with his parents was maybe too much for him. And when we went to the movies to see a rom-com about two teen boys and he just went off about how love, even our own, could never be Hollywood-worthy, I stormed off and thought he would chase me and apologize or call my name or literally anything a boyfriend should do.  
  
  Nothing for three days. Not until I called to ask him if we were ever going to talk again. Then he surprised me at my apartment and told me he thought we were broken up, so he kissed some random guy at a party. He desperately wanted another chance, but nope. I broke up with him. For real. Even if he thought things were over between us, he couldn’t even wait a week before moving on? Pretty hard not to feel worthless after that.  
  
  I reach Dylan’s building and press his apartment number, and he buzzes me up immediately, which is great because I’m not about that waiting life today. I’m carrying around a box of my ex-boyfriend’s things. I’m wearing a backpack with summer homework. Today sucks.  
  
  I yawn in the elevator. I had to get up at seven because of summer school. Yay life. The universe keeps on swinging—brass knuckles to the heart and ego.  
  
  I step out of the elevator and let myself into Dylan’s apartment because we’re that tight. But I’m smart enough to knock on his bedroom door ever since a few months ago when I walked in and he was really going at it with himself.  
  
  “Hand out of your pants?” I ask.  
  
  “Unfortunately,” Dylan responds from the other side.  
  
  I open the door. Dylan is sitting on his bed, texting away. He’s cut his hair since I saw him last night for dinner. He’s the only dude my age I know who’s rocking a beard. For the longest time I swore I was behind on the puberty game since I haven’t even grown a mustache, but Dylan’s actually the freak show here—handsome freak show.  
  
  “Big Ben,” Dylan sings, putting down his phone. “Light of my life. He Who Is Stuck in School.” Summer school double-sucks because Dylan has been cracking jokes ever since that day I came out of the guidance counselor’s office with the bad news. He’s just lucky that no one he ever dated persuaded him to skip studying and to trust that the right grades would fall into place.  
  
  “Hey,” I say. Cute nicknames aren’t really my thing.  
  
  Dylan points at my chest. “That shirt is a thing of beauty, isn’t she?”  
  
  His wardrobe consists primarily of T-shirts from indie coffee shops around the city, and he gave me this Dream & Bean shirt last night when he came over for dinner. Dylan hooks me up when his dresser gets too crowded. He doesn’t usually let go of his favorites, like Dream & Bean, but I’m not complaining.  
  
  “I didn’t have anything clean to wear,” I say. “It’s not, like, a cool shirt.”  
  
  “That’s hurtful, but I’m guessing you’re in a mood because you’re carrying a breakup box you were going to hand over to Hudson. What happened?”  
  
  “He didn’t come to scho  
ol today.” I put down the box.  
  
  “Skipping day one of summer school seems like a bad start,” Dylan says.  
  
  “Yeah, I asked Harriett if she would take it to him and she said no,” I say. “Then I was going to mail it, but Priority shipping cost too much.”  
  
  “Why did it have to be Priority shipping?”  
  
  “Because I want the box out of my face sooner.”  
  
  “Regular shipping would’ve done the trick too.” Dylan raises his left eyebrow. “You couldn’t do it, could you?”  
  
  I put down the box I should’ve mailed or thrown away or tied to an anchor and dropped into a river. “Stop seeing past my bullshit, it’s my bullshit.”  
  
  Dylan gets up and hugs me. “Shh-shh-shh-shh.” He rubs circles into my back.  
  
  “Your soothing voice isn’t soothing me.”  
  
  Dylan kisses my cheek. “It’s okay, Pudding Pop.”  
  
  I sit down cross-legged on his bed. I’m tempted to reach for my phone to see if I’ve missed any texts from Hudson, or to check Instagram to see if he has uploaded a new selfie. But I know there won’t be any texts, and I’ve unfollowed him on every platform.  
  
  “I don’t want to see him fail out of summer school because he’s avoiding me. He’ll get left behind if he’s absent three times.”  
  
  “Maybe. But that’s his problem. If he doesn’t show up, you won’t have to spend the summer with him. Problem solved.”  
  
  It wasn’t that long ago when spending my summer with Hudson was all I could think about. A summer as boyfriends in pools and parks and each other’s bedrooms while our parents were working—not exes who are in summer school because we spent more time studying each other than doing our chemistry homework.  
  
  “Wish you were in the trenches with me,” I say. “He has his best friend, and I should have mine too.”  
  
  “Oh man, remind me to never commit a crime with you. You’ll get caught and out me so fast.” Dylan checks his phone, like we’re not even talking, which is my least favorite thing about humans. “That class would be all drama anyway. I can’t be there with my ex, that’s not a healthy environment.”  
  
  “I am literally in there with my ex, Dylan.”  
  
  “No you’re not. He didn’t show up, and if he does, don’t forget you got the edge here. You won the breakup by being the Breaker Upper. It would double-suck if he broke up with you. It only single-sucks for you.”  
  
  I’d trade my poor kingdom for a universe where single-suck heartbreak isn’t a victory. But here we are.  
  
  Recent breakups prove that we should’ve never screwed up our friend circle by trying to date. Not to point fingers, but Dylan and Harriett started this. The four of us had a good thing going until Dylan and Harriett kissed on New Year’s Eve. I was kind of into Hudson and I was pretty sure he was into me too, but when we turned to each other that night we didn’t kiss, we just shook our heads because I knew my best friend and he knew his. This was never going to last. Maybe Hudson and I wouldn’t have been inspired to give it a shot ourselves if we hadn’t been left with a lot of alone time while Dylan and Harriett spent their weekends together.  
  
  I miss the squad days.  
  
  I get up and turn on the Wii because I need some shit-talking and entertainment to cheer me up. The triumphant opening of Super Smash Bros. blasts from the TV. Dylan’s top character is Luigi because he thinks Mario is overrated. I go for Zelda because she teleports and deflects projectiles and shoots fireballs from great distances, which are all optimal moves for any player looking to avoid hand-to-hand combat.  
  
  We get the game going.  
  
  “On the sad scale, how are you feeling today?” Dylan asks. “Opening-montage-of-Up sad? Or Nemo’s-mom-dying sad?”  
  
  “Whoa, no. Definitely not opening-montage-of-Up sad. That shit was devastating. I’d guess I’m somewhere in between, like last-five-minutes-of-Toy-Story-3 sad. I just need time to bounce back.”  
  
  “No doubt. Okay, I need to tell you a thing.”  
  
  “Are you breaking up with me?” I ask. “Because not cool.”  
  
  “Sort of,” Dylan says. He does this big dramatic pause while hammering down on one button so Luigi keeps shooting green fireballs at Zelda. “I met this girl at a coffee shop.”  
  
  “That is the most Dylan sentence you’ve ever said.”  
  
  “Right?” Dylan’s chuckle is very charming. “Okay, so after my doctor’s appointment yesterday I went uptown to try this coffee spot.”  
  
  “Of course you leave an appointment for your heart condition by going straight to a coffee shop. You’re a little too on brand sometimes.”  
  
  “The yearly ritual,” Dylan says. He has a heart condition called mitral valve prolapse, which isn’t as shitty as it sounds—at least not in Dylan’s case. I don’t know what he’d do if his doctors actually banned him from coffee. “Anyway. I walked past Kool Koffee, which I have avoided forever because you know I don’t find cutesy spellings cute, and she stepped outside to throw away some trash and I became trash for her.”  
  
  “As you do.”  
  
  “But I couldn’t walk in there wearing a Dream & Bean shirt.”  
  
  “Why not?”  
  
  “Uh. Do you walk into Burger King with a Happy Meal? No. That shit is disrespectful. Have some common sense.”  
  
  “My common sense is telling me to make new friends.”  
  
  “I just didn’t want to be disrespectful.”  
  
  “You just disrespected me.”  
  
  “I’m talking about her.”  
  
  “Of course you are. Wait. Is that why you gave me this shirt last night?”  
  
  “Yes. I panicked.”  
  
  “You’re so weird. Go on.”  
  
  “I braved Kool Koffee today dressed appropriately . . .” Dylan gestures at his solid blue T-shirt. Nice and neutral. “. . . and she was humming an Elliott Smith song while making someone’s espresso, and I was done. Overdone. Big Ben, in a single moment, I gained a future wife and an unlimited supply of coffee.”  
  
  It’s really hard to be happy for someone finding romance when I’ve clearly just taken a loss in the same department, but it’s Dylan. “I can’t wait to meet my future sister-in-law.”  
  
  “You remember that BuzzFeed post with the Harry Potter wedding? Samantha and I will do something coffee-themed. Everyone will wear barista aprons. Toasting with mugs. My face drawn in everyone’s espresso.”  
  
  “You are too much.”  
  
  “One downside though.”  
  
  “She has a downside already?”  
  
  “She’s a huge supporter of Kool Koffee because they donate some portions to charities, and she thinks serious coffee drinkers should be better about where they’re buying coffee. I mean, I’m not ready to be monogamous with Kool Koffee.”  
  
  “Did she actually ask you to do that?”  
  
  “No, but . . . she asked without asking. And when the One comes along, there are things we must sacrifice.”  
  
  “There’s no way you’re quitting Dream & Bean coffee.”  
  
  “Oh hell no. I’m quitting drinking it in front of Samantha. What she doesn’t know won’t hurt.”  
  
  “Only you could make drinking coffee sound nefarious.”  
  
  “Anyway. I added other coffee shop shirts into your drawer so I don’t get tempted.”  
  
  I check out the shirts because maybe there’s actually a winner in here. And yeah, I have a drawer in his bedroom and he has one in mine. We’ve slept over at each other’s places enough that it makes sense. When I was first getting cool with the coming-out thing in school, I always felt super self-conscious in gym, like everyone thought I would try and check them out. It’s really dope having a bro like Dylan who is super cool changing in front of me and me changing in front of him. I hope I don’t lose his awesomeness again like I have every time he meets the One.  
  
  “Wait. Why didn’t you tell me about seeing Samantha last night when you came over?” I ask.  
  
  “I don’t know,” Dylan says. Like that’s a satisfying answer. Like I’m about to just go “Okay, cool,” and go back to kicking his ass in Super Smash.  
  
&  
nbsp; “You never tell me when you first get a crush,” I say.  
  
  “Name one time.”  
  
  “Gabriella and Heather and Natalia and—”  
  
  “I said one time.”  
  
  “—and Harriett. It’s just weird. We tell each other everything.”  
  
  Dylan nods. “Not trying to jinx myself, I guess. You know how my dad always goes on about how he knew he would marry my mom when they met in freshman year? I’m getting those same vibes from Samantha.”  
  
  I act like I haven’t heard Dylan say this before, most recently with Harriett, who he broke up with in March, but I let it go. Maybe it will work this time. We keep playing as Dylan goes on and on about which hot beverage he and Samantha should name their firstborn after, and I refuse to be Uncle Ben to any child named Cider.  
  
  I’m a little jealous Dylan is in this phase of his new romance, where it feels like anything is possible. Like how Samantha could actually be the love of his life. Like when I thought Hudson was going to be mine. How I couldn’t wait to wake up to his face—his beautiful lazy eye, the little bump on his nose, his suggestive dark eyebrows that don’t match his short auburn hair. The way he changed my worldviews, like whenever he had to push back at idiots in school who got at him because of his effeminate mannerisms; he really helped me forget my own idiocy on what I thought a man was supposed to look like. And those nerves before we had sex for the first time in March, not knowing if it was going to be good or not. Spoiler: it was awesome.  
  
  Maybe I can kick so much ass this week at school that the teachers will realize I don’t actually need to be stuck taking classes for the next month and I’ll be Hudson-free.  
  
  Though I got to be real, I would’ve probably ended up in summer school even if Hudson was never in the picture. I’m not super tight with school.  
  
  “You’ll always be my number one, Big Ben,” Dylan says. “Until Baby Cider is born.

1mz497d,https://www.reddit.com/r/BruisedNotBroken/comments/1mz497d/summer_breakup_for_autumn_sorrows/,"Summer Breakup, for Autumn Sorrows","I said you didn't know how to love, but I hid from you that neither did I. So through 1010 pixels, I ask your forgiveness, because I am as much at fault as you are, and I don't want to carry the weight of your pain on top of my own, because I know I hurt you. But understand me, I am also an animal suffering from having left you. My pain seems immeasurable, even insurmountable, and every day I try to hate you, to stop loving you.

It is 5:37 in the morning. Outside, it's 28 degrees Celsius. Summer is a fraud, like everything else. And the autumn that will read 69 degrees Fahrenheit won't manage to cool my heart or soothe my sorrow.

I'm not writing a message in a bottle. I'm writing at the kitchen table, on a receipt. Because the nice paper was for promises. Promises… we see what's left of them.

6000.71 miles separate us… These numbers also hurt me. When you go to bed, I get up. We live in the wrong replay of the same shitty day. You rant about all those mainstream idiots, I count the stars that have ceased to shine. We share that. Unfortunately for me, that's all we share.

They say ""the love of your life."" Bullshit. You are not ""the love of my life."" You are the fucking life. Period. The rest is just noise. A deafening noise of silence, of meals growing cold, of an alarm clock ringing all by itself.

And the worst part, the real poison that slowly eats away at the soul, is that we knew. We knew we held the universe in our hands, that fucking universe that told jokes and knew the name of all my stars. And we let it slip away. Not through drama, not through betrayal. Out of cowardice. Out of fatigue. Because it was too much. Too big. Too intense. Too true.

So I chose silence. I preferred the bland taste of nothing over the risk of getting burned again by your sun. I fled. I hid in the small, the mediocre, the safe. And now, I am the queen of a cotton kingdom, deaf and blind.

We didn't know how to love each other. We just knew that we couldn't not love each other. It was visceral. It was obvious. And we let that obvious truth rot on the side of the road, like an accident we no longer talk about.

It's 5:54 now. Seventeen minutes lost. Seventeen more minutes spent away from you. Time is precious, that's the real torture. Every second that passes is a little death. We're too old to believe that regrets are romantic. They're just stupid. And heavy. Very heavy.

So no, this is not a love letter. It's a stifled scream. It's rage. It's the raw truth, barefaced, at 5 in the morning with a sick heat that has no business being here.

I love you. And now, I loved you. It's a fact. As factual and absurd as these 28 degrees at summer's end. And it's useless. Absolutely useless, because you refused me everything. You never talked to me, you never heard me, and you never saw the smile I gave you. We are two idiots; living on the same planet, separated by a fucking ocean and our love is now just a pixel in black and white.

That's all. I'm going to make coffee. It will be as bitter as this page...
 
(There is no signature. Just the circular, greasy stain from the bottom of a mug left too long on the word ""loved"").
             
YOU ARE THE LOVE OF MY LIFE IN PIXELS, IN ALL CAPS AND IN THE PLURAL. 💓😍

1mz4930,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChartNavigators/comments/1mz4930/weekly_market_report/,Weekly Market Report,"TL;DR 
 
SPY is rangebound between 636 and 646 as volatility persists. Sector performance is mixed, with leadership in discretionary, energy, and materials, while consumer staples and utilities underperformed. Earnings season is heating up with PDD, SMTC, NVDA, BABA, OKTA, DG, MRVL, KSS, and BMO all set to report, led by Nvidia’s defining AI and semiconductor results. Fed data, inflation, and economic releases will guide near-term market tone. Bitcoin is steady near 114,800 and Ethereum is at 4,900 near resistance. IPOs and SPAC activity are growing, with BlackRock’s coffee IPO drawing attention.  


 
 
The market is navigating key [SPY](https://flic.kr/p/2roWLDn)levels at 636 support and 646 resistance. Mixed sector performance dominated the week, with leadership seen in consumer discretionary, which gained 3.04%, energy up 2.04%, and materials adding 1.98%. Defensive consumer staples were flat at 0.00% as risk-on sentiment pulled flows away from safe havens. Analyst sentiment reflects cautious optimism, with a balanced view on direction as volatility remains elevated.  

Significant news flow included Barclays upgrading Altria’s price target, BlackRock filing for a new coffee IPO, and positive compliance updates from CYCU on NASDAQ. The EU is advancing its digital stablecoin initiative, signaling broader regulatory acceptance of blockchain adoption. Domestically, CSX announced a new international services deal with BNSF, strengthening logistics, while the U.S. President announced an investigation into furniture tariffs.  

Consumer discretionary led markets with a gain of 3.04%, followed by strength in energy at 2.04% and materials at 1.98%. Financials rose 1.65%, while industrials gained 1.63%, both benefitting from stable macro conditions and flows into cyclicals. Technology advanced 1.36% with semiconductors in focus, while healthcare added 0.82% and utilities rose by 0.54%. Consumer staples showed no movement, underperforming as money rotated out of defensive positioning.  

 
The near-term spotlight is on PDD Holdings and Semtech (SMTC), both reporting Monday. PDD’s international e-commerce performance could drive volatility in consumer discretionary, while SMTC’s results may influence sentiment across semiconductors and technology stocks broadly.  

Looking ahead, earnings from BMO, Alibaba (BABA), Okta (OKTA), Kohl’s (KSS), Nvidia (NVDA), Dollar General (DG), and Marvell Technology (MRVL) are expected. Nvidia’s results are the clear market focus, likely serving as a bellwether for the AI and semiconductor narrative. Marvell’s data will highlight semiconductor performance beyond Nvidia, while Okta provides a look into cloud and cybersecurity growth. Alibaba’s results shed light on international consumer demand as trade and tariff policy headlines evolve.  

New Home Sales and remarks from Fed officials Logan and Williams, could shift rate expectations and market psychology. Financials and real estate, which already gained 1.65% and 1.58% this week, may react strongly to any change in rate-related forward guidance. Inflation data remains moderate, supporting a cautious but constructive outlook and allowing selective risk-taking. Dip-buying strategies are emerging within sectors affected by inflationary worries but showing underlying strength.  


Global tension remains a background risk, though secondary to earnings and Fed discussions this week. Key developments include the EU accelerating its digital stablecoin regulatory framework, boosting fintech and blockchain sentiment, and renewed U.S. focus on trade policy with an investigation into furniture tariffs. The logistics sector was given a lift by the CSX-BNSF international deal, which strengthens cross-border services and supply chains.  


Rotation into growth and cyclical names was evident, with discretionary, energy, materials, financials, and industrials all gaining solid traction. Defensive sectors underperformed, with consumer staples flat while utilities rose only slightly. This reflects investors moving away from defensive positioning and leaning into risk exposure in the face of moderating inflation and steady interest rate expectations.  


BlackRock filed for a coffee-focused IPO, underscoring investor appetite for consumer-facing plays. Market participants are also watching several SPAC and smaller IPOs expected to debut next week with themes concentrated in green energy, biotech, and fintech.  

 
Bitcoin remains in consolidation near the 114,800 level, holding firm above key support. A breakout above 120,000 could open new upside momentum, while a breakdown would create risk of a retrace toward 110,000. Ethereum is trading around 4,853, near resistance. If broken, this could fuel renewed altcoin participation and expanded dominance within decentralized finance markets.  


Unemployment claims remain stable, emphasizing ongoing labor market resilience. Retail sales data continues to demonstrate strength, offering support to consumer discretionary stocks that already outperformed strongly in the latest sector rotation.  


SPY continues showing technical strength. Support stands at 636, while resistance remains at 646. The Money Flow Index is above 50, confirming positive inflows, while the Directional Movement Index shows +DI exceeding -DI with a strong ADX, validating trend strength. Price action remains supported above the Displaced Moving Average, which keeps bullish momentum intact. Overall, SPY is trading in a consolidation zone. Breaking above 646 would confirm breakout momentum for the next leg higher, while a drop below 636 would risk undermining the short-term bullish structure.",1,1756062079.0,ChartNavigators,1,1.0,False
1mz48w5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mz48w5/can_shardor_km802_coffee_makers_features_deliver/,Can SHARDOR KM802 Coffee Maker's Features Deliver the Perfect Hot and Iced Brew Review?,"Testing the SHARDOR KM-802B Hot & Iced Coffee Maker felt like an adventure for my inner caffeine enthusiast. Right from unboxing, I could see its sleek glossy black design promising to complement any modern kitchen setup. Beyond aesthetics, this coffee maker is packed with features aimed at simplifying and elevating your daily brewing ritual. Here’s my take after using it both casually and during busy mornings.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact dimensions (11.46""D x 11.93""W x 5.28""H) of this machine made it a perfect fit even for smaller countertops. Its shiny black finish feels modern without looking overly industrial. I loved how lightweight it is, weighing just 4.86 pounds, yet it doesn’t feel flimsy. The removable water tank, which holds a generous 52 ounces, made the process of cleaning and refilling effortless. By the way, if you’re one of those who forgets about brewing until it’s over, the automatic shut-off feature kicks in after five minutes – a thoughtful energy-saving design.

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
A noticeable highlight is its 3-in-1 compatibility, supporting K-cups, ground coffee, and tea, so you’re not limited by one brewing method. Having guests with different preferences? No problem! I tested out all three options and couldn’t love the versatility more. It delivers hot or iced coffee at lightning speed—in under a minute for most brews. With five brewing capacities (6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 oz), the machine accommodates everyone’s drink size preferences, from small morning jolts to tall travel mugs. Yep, even my 6.8-inch tumbler slid right in after I removed the drip tray.

**[Check SHARDOR KM-802B price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0drfzq8cn/)**

**Upsides**  
- Strength selection: Brew standard or bold coffee for tailored flavor.  
- Speedy brewing: Get fresh coffee in less than a minute.  
- Large water reservoir eliminates frequent refills.  
- Works with travel mugs once the drip tray is removed.  
- Energy-efficient with an auto-off timer.

**Flavor Quality and Iced Coffee Feat**  
Let’s talk about flavor! This device didn’t disappoint in delivering consistently hot, aromatic cups. What pleasantly surprised me was the bold setting—it produced a stronger, richer taste that felt indulgent during slow weekends. For iced coffee lovers, pouring the hot brew directly over ice didn’t result in watery disappointment. The iced coffee maintained its strength and smoothness, especially when using the bold setting.

**Boons**  
- Makes robust iced coffee; great for warmer days.  
- No plastic taste often associated with some K-cup brewers.  
- Intuitive functions make brewing foolproof for beginners.

**What Left Me Wanting More**  
No product is perfect, and this coffee maker has its quirks.  

- The glossy finish looks great but shows fingerprints easily, which may bother those who prefer a spotless appliance.  
- Though it’s compatible with K-cups and ground coffee, the basket filter is slightly tricky to reassemble if removed for cleaning.  
- The 5-minute shut-off, while energy-saving, might be inconvenient for those brewing back-to-back oversized cups.  

Overall, these are minor inconveniences rather than deal-breaking flaws.

**Drawbacks**  
- Fingerprints are easily visible on the glossy finish.  
- The reusable filter basket feels a bit fiddly.  
- Short shut-off timer might rush slow morning coffee lovers.

**Competing Products**  
I had the chance to compare this to other single-serve brewers like the Keurig K-Mini and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. The Keurig K-Mini is equally compact but lacks the bold strength feature that makes the SHARDOR shine. The Hamilton, while offering similar versatility with ground coffee and K-cups, takes longer to brew and doesn’t have such a large reservoir capacity. What tips the scale in favor of this coffee maker is how it balances speed, flavor, and user customization in one sleek unit. However, if you prioritize aesthetics over features, you might find the Keurig’s minimalist design more appealing.

**Price Worthiness**  
Given its versatility and robust features, this product offers excellent value for its quality. Its ability to brew both hot and iced coffee, the customizable strength setting, and the energy-saving feature make it a terrific option for households with varied drink preferences. Compared to pricier rivals, you get similar functionality without breaking the bank. For me, the time saved and the flavor consistency were worth every penny.

1mz478d,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyShine/comments/1mz478d/delve_into_whether_sheglam_lip_liner_lives_up_to/,Delve Into Whether SHEGLAM Lip Liner Lives Up to the Hype for Everyday Wear,"**Elevating Everyday Lip Looks with SHEGLAM b250428969400**

The SHEGLAM b250428969400 lip liner genuinely feels like a little pocket of magic for anyone who loves experimenting with their lip game. As someone who tests makeup almost daily, I couldn't have been more intrigued by the promise of a soft-focus, blurred finish. SHEGLAM labels this product as long-lasting, smudge-resistant, vegan, and cruelty-free, which are all key attributes that immediately drew me to it.

The first thing I noticed about this lip liner was its sleek and minimalistic packaging. It’s lightweight and compact, fitting snugly in my makeup bag. Definitely a plus for someone like me who’s constantly on the go. The shade Forest Fairy, which I was testing, is already a winning point. It’s one of those universally flattering hues, making it versatile enough for both subtle day looks and dramatic evening styles.

**Soft-Focus Finish That Delivers**

What caught my attention during the very first application was the way this lip liner glided on like butter. The promise of a soft-focus, blurred finish isn’t just marketing fluff; it really does give an airbrushed vibe without feeling dry or heavy. Call me impressed! I tried blending it with a warm-toned lipstick, and the diffused, blurred edges added a modern, editorial touch to my makeup. The precision it offers makes it perfect for defining sharp edges too, which I imagine is a win-win for people hunting for a high-end look without a hefty price tag.

[Check SHEGLAM b250428969400 price on Amazon.](https://paulahansen.com/p/b0f7xj73md/)

**Long-Wearing Formula Keeps Its Word**

Longevity is an area where so many liners fail, but I was taken aback by how well this one performed. The product stayed put for hours, even through multiple cups of coffee and a snack-filled work-from-home day. It didn’t budge; seriously, no feathering, no fading. I didn’t expect it to stand up to greasy meals, but hey, for a lip liner at this level, that’s asking a bit much. The smudge-resistant feature is a godsend for someone like me with a bad habit of touching my face too often.

**Moisturizing and Comfortable All Day**

Another surprise: the formula. HOLY hydration! Most liners I’ve tried tend to dry out my lips after about an hour, but this one was different. Its lip-loving, moisturizing ingredients genuinely live up to the marketing claims. Even by the end of the day, my lips felt supple. For someone constantly testing products, this is a dream because harsh, drying formulas often mean dealing with cracked, painful lips after multiple applications.

**Positives**

• Unique soft-focus finish that flatters any lip shape.  
• Long-lasting durability that survives drinks and snacks.  
• Smudge-resistant and low-maintenance for on-the-go users.  
• Hydrating formula perfect for daily wear.  

**Caveats**

• Doesn’t hold up against greasy meals.  
• Limited shade options (hoping for more soon!).  

**Product Rivals in the Beauty Sphere**

When compared to other lip liners on the market, SHEGLAM takes a clear lead in comfort and innovation. For instance, NYX Professional’s Slide-On Lip Pencil might match SHEGLAM in pigmentation, but it lacks the moisturizing properties that give this product its all-day comfort. Similarly, MAC’s Lip Pencil offers precise application but falls short with its traditional matte finish – it doesn’t have that blurred, soft-focus touch that’s all the rage these days.

What truly sets this product apart from pricier competitors is its cruelty-free certification. While other brands like Charlotte Tilbury and Anastasia Beverly Hills offer excellent products, they aren’t always accessible price-wise, and the cruelty-free aspect makes SHEGLAM a guilt-free indulgence.

**Price Performance: What Makes It Worth It**

Considering what it brings to the table, the SHEGLAM lip liner offers incredible value for money. The longevity, innovative finish, hydration – all of this at a more reasonable price than many luxury alternatives – makes it a hidden gem in the beauty market. Often, with budget-friendly makeup, you expect to sacrifice quality, but this liner proves that high performance and affordability can go hand-in-hand. SHEGLAM has redefined what budget-friendly, quality lip liners should deliver.

It tells u which settings it recommends and overall is super easy and does everything for you. However I also heard that Breville pulls the best tasting and quality shots, but has more of a learning curve.

1mz45zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1mz45zo/he_actually_said_the_quiet_part_out_loud/,He Actually Said the Quiet Part Out Loud,"My husband and I got into an argument while running errands with the kids today. He works a manual labor job in a relatively rough environment (he's indoors, but the space isn't well climate controlled so he experiences some temperature extremes, depending on the weather). I'm a SAHM to a toddler and an infant, and we have several pets.

Today, during our argument, he said he didn’t feel like I respect his contributions to the household, meaning his work outside of the home, and then went on a brief tangent about how tough his job is. I told him I do respect that, I've never said otherwise (and I truly haven't, I would never- I'm super grateful to be a SAHM), but that I don't feel like he respects my work around the home.

He actually said to me that he could do my job, but that I could never do his. Why? Because I can't lift 50lbs. My toddler weighs 35lbs and my infant weighs 21lbs, and I have absolutely had to carry them, plus a diaper bag and a coffee, into the house by myself on multiple occasions. But that's not even the point! The point is that he has so little knowledge of, or respect for, what I do on a daily basis that he, the man who cant pack the diaper bag for a day out without asking me 21 questions, thinks he could take care of himself, the children, our home, our meals, and our pets. No, no he cannot.

Prime example? We had this conversation on the way home from running an errand. When I got the baby out of his carseat, I noticed he was reclined pretty far back in his seat. Why? Because my husband hadn't clicked the carseat into the base before we left, he just set it down. We drove down the highway with his carseat not installed on the base. It is the carseat he chose, installed, and absolutely knows how to use correctly. This was obviously an accident, but things along these lines are a constant occurrence.

1mz41kx,https://www.reddit.com/r/JPMorganChase/comments/1mz41kx/my_experience_working_at_jpmorgan_chase_not_what/,My Experience Working at JPMorgan Chase – Not What I Expected,"Reposting after my post was taken down on another site.

I worked in commercial banking at JPMorgan Chase, one of the biggest and most well-known banks in the world. This is just my perspective from the division I was in — I can’t speak for every corner of such a massive firm and yes I admit, I come off like a jaded, bitter dumped ex BF. But for anyone thinking about working there, here’s what it was like.

I came in with years of experience in banking sales and in credit, and I was excited. JPM has an incredible reputation, cutting-edge technology, and a leadership team that is legendary in the industry. I thought I was joining the best of the best.

The reality? It felt like the culture was: “We’re JPMorgan Chase. Everyone wants to be here. If you’re not happy, there’s the door.” To succeed, you had to hustle constantly — chase every lead, knock on every door, live and breathe origination. That part is fair; banking is about generating business.

But here’s the irony: despite having trillions in assets, the budget for client entertainment was laughably small. I’m talking “barely enough for coffee and a bagel each month.” Hitting some of the highest goals in the industry with that kind of support felt impossible. Managers often paid for happy hours out of their own pocket just to build some team morale.

Sadly, I feel that to become the best today you need to leverage your position as a firm unfairly, to leverage it against your employees and your customers. You need to make employees put in five dollars worth of work and pay them two dollars. Some call that margin, I call that leverage. I have come to realize that the attitude at the firm is a “take it or leave it” attitude. To it’s employees, customers and clients it’s a “we don’t need you attitude, if you’re not happy, the door is right there. We are JPMC and our CEO is Jamie Dimon. Everyone wants to be here, and you will be easily replaced”. I found it was certainly the attitude of my manager. As such the bank churns through people like no other.

Work-from-home? Forget it. The expectation was long hours in the office, every day. Leaving early — even occasionally — was basically career suicide. For anyone with a long commute or a family, it was brutal. On top of that, there weren’t even enough desks or meeting rooms to go around. Sit in the wrong section, and you’d risk a passive-aggressive sticky note telling you to move.

Hey Jamie, how about I trade you your chopper, nanny, butler and grown kids for my hour and half commute on the train to see my little ones well past their bedtime every weeknight? But hey, I signed up for this and if I’m not happy  “the door is right there” at JPMC.

back to my experience....after much digression and run on statements! The pressure started immediately. New hires were regularly told they had just a couple months to deliver huge results or risk being let go. I remember hearing about one person who came back from their wedding only to be told they had “lost time to make up.” That pretty much summed it up.

I was also once told I needed to be “more like a used car salesman” if I wanted to make it there. Apparently building trust and real relationships wasn’t fast enough — shareholders wanted instant returns. Clients, meanwhile, were tired of seeing their relationship managers churn every year or two, which made building credibility nearly impossible.

Everything was stack-ranked and posted publicly, which only fueled the toxicity. I also heard repeatedly that high performers sometimes found themselves under “investigation” just before bonuses were due — while certain superstars got a pass despite questionable tactics.

When I was finally told I was done, I almost laughed with relief. Walking out of there felt like an elephant had stepped off my back. I shook my manager’s hand and honestly felt like I’d won the lottery.

If you’re considering JPMorgan Chase for the culture or work-life balance, I’d say think twice. You’ll learn a lot, and the name carries weight, but the trade-offs — at least in my corner of the bank — just weren’t worth it.

Life’s too short for a job that feels this long.

1mz41af,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1mz41af/my_colonoscopy_experience_uk/,My colonoscopy experience (UK),"Hello,

I had my first ever colonoscopy today and as an anxious neurodivergent, I was obsessively reading people's accounts of the procedure and wanted to share mine in case it helps or reassures anyone/answers questions. Personally I felt very nervous about the logistics of the procedure and prep so hopefully this helps.

I (28F) had an incident involving diarrhea and blood in my stools during my menstrual cycle back in June. At the time did a stool sample which showed an elevated calprotectin level of 1800, obviously very high and I think the doctors strongly suspected an IBD. I had to wait for a referral to gastroenterology and had a colonoscopy today. 

I folllwed the doctors instructions to the letter and I started my low fibre diet 3 days ago. I ate white rice with egg and soy sauce, white pasta with chicken and cheese and no sauce, babybel cheese and plain ice cream with no bits. Very boring and I think I may have been over cautious to be on the safe side. 

On my prep day I followed the instructions and was allowed to eat a light breakfast and then no food after 9am, I had white toast with egg and then during the day I kept myself hydrated mainly with black coffee, herbal tea and water. I ended up doing a lot of studying and coursework to distract myself from hunger and it worked quite well.

The prep I had to take was Plenvu, the first 500ml dose at 6pm was unpleasant tasting but manageable and took me about an hour to drink. I chilled it in the fridge and used a boba straw as this is supposed to make it more palatable but it was still disgusting tbh.

It gave me diarrhea obviously, but I will say it wasn't as dramatic as I expected, maybe because I was so cautious with my diet beforehand. Unlike having normal stomach upset where there might be cramping and pain, for me there was no cramping involved, it kind of just felt like I needed the toilet and then just came out with no real effort involved lol. I read lots of accounts of urgency but I personally didn't really experience this, I was able to do other things and when I felt the urge I could just walk to the toilet and go without feeling like I had to urgently rush. I appreciate it's different for everyone though. I will also say that only the first time I went to the toilet produced actual liquid poop, all the other times what was coming out of me was a basically clear yellowy fluid, which is actually apparently  what is meant to happen to clear your system out. It sounds gross but its actually easier to deal with than poop because it is easier to clean and there's no straining involved lol. Also speaking of cleaning, I used wet wipes as it did start to burn after a while due to the sheer amount coming out of me.

Then my second and final 500ml dose was at 9pm, this one started off fine, I had stopped going to the bathroom at this point and was sipping it while watching tv. But I got halfway through the 500ml and then started to feel very sick. I slowed down the sipping and it took me about an hour and a half in total to drink most of it. I had about 50ml left and I could just feel I was going to throw up, but I forced it down because the instructions said I had to. As soon as I had that final chug I projectile vomited into the sink lol, but I will say it was mostly water.

 I then carried on needing the bathroom til about 11pm and then it started to slow. I drank loads of water and went to bed around 12:30pm and slept until around 6:30am when I woke up and needed to go to the bathroom again. I was able to drink until 3 hours before my procedure which was at 9:45am so I chugged water, had a shower etc and then my mum drove me to hospital. At this point I was pooping the clear liquid still, maybe every hour or so.

At the hospital I was in the waiting room for about half an hour and then was taken to the preparation room where a nurse weighed me, asked me questions, checked my vitals etc. I got changed into 'dignity shorts' and a hospital gown. Then she put a cannula in my arm. I then had to wait like half an hour or so, I will say that the waiting with the needle in my arm was the most unpleasant part of the hospital experience because I was very anxious. The doctor came and read me a consent form which I had to sign and then I had to wait for 15 mins or so. 

Eventually I was taken to the procedure room with the doctor and 2 nurses who immediately put me at ease by making small talk and asking me what I wanted to eat after and my fave foods. I had the sedation (fentanyl and midazolam) and was awake and conscious throughout the entire thing but felt no pain. Minor discomfort at times but genuinely zero pain. I also kind of liked being awake and lucid because it made me feel more in control and I could watch the screen and understand what was happening to me. They asked me to roll over onto my back but other than that there was minimal moving me around and prodding at me and so on. I felt very well taken care of the entire time and they were asking me if I felt ok and I was honestly as comfortable as you could possibly be in the situation.

The examination took around 20 minutes and then I was wheeled into a recovery ward and given tea and biscuits and monitored for a bit, then like half an hour later I got dressed to go and had my results which were all normal, but based on my symptoms they've done some routine biopsies which take around 8 weeks to get the results for, so i dont think im completely out of the IBD woods yet until I know the results for these, but based on the colonoscopy today they didn't find anything.
Also, as a sidenote the report says my 'Boston bowel prep total' was a 9 which is excellent so it apparently doesnt matter I vomited up my last dose.

I then got driven home and felt fine, even was able to go to Aldi with my mum and do some food shopping. I had a chicken sandwich at home, went to the bathroom again and had very loose watery stools but nothing too scary and this is apparently normal. I then napped until dinner time and just had chicken pho and some spring rolls which I feel were a bit of a mistake because my stomach hurts and is feeling quite sensitive lol, but it's manageable and hopefully will go away soon.. I also went to the bathroom again for the second time and once again it was very loose snd watery stools but this is apparently normal so I won't worry too much 

So this is a very long and detailed post but hopefully this helps people get a sense of how it all works! I am a very anxious person and was genuinely dreading today for weeks but the colonoscopy procedure itself was the easiest part of everything that happened. Worst was the prep because of the taste and nausea and waiting with the needle in my arm because of the anxiety but these were manageable. 

My main tips:

1) Follow the low fibre diet seriously and eat lighter meals because I think it did help the prep go more smoothly. 

2) Expect waiting around at the hospital. I found it helpful having a family member with me because it helped distract me and gave me someone to talk to.

3) Stress and anxiety make things feel so much worse than they are. I was goggling complications for days and reading worst case scenarios of people talking about how colonscopies completely fuck up their systems and became convinced this would happen to me. But I think anxiety and stress make everything worse and can compound discomfort so keep in mind that doom scrolling and purposefully looking up horror stories only gives a warped image of the procedure.",4,1756061586.0,colonoscopy,1,1.0,False

It’s not just the folks at your table. Even random people who were eating elsewhere stroll up, place their empty plates & glasses right in between you and your plate, and walk off?

What’s stopping people from using the plate collection trolleys? They’re literally just a couple of steps away most of the time. Instead, you’re left with someone else’s sticky plate sharing table space with your meal.

I enjoy hiking, getting drinks, swimming, movies, reading, coffee dates. I really enjoy doing anything outside and I want to start working out in a group setting if there’s anything out there. 

This is my first time in Georgia so any recommendations outside of Macon would also be great. I don’t have any family and friends here as everyone is either in Texas or Florida so having a bit of homesickness but I’m excited for this new chapter of life.

I’m moving to Kuala Lumpur in October with my girlfriend (she’s Malaysian) and I’m trying to line up work and meet people before I land.

I’m not super specialised — I’m good at keeping people informed, clearing blockers, and making messy processes simple.

**How you can help:** Where would *you* look in KL? Any companies actually hiring early–mid expats, recruiters you rate, or networking groups/events worth joining before I arrive? Happy to do remote interviews now — and happy to buy a coffee in Oct/Nov if you’re up for a chat.

I also have code still running in production that makes me cringe when I look at it now.

This week I wrote a simple recursive function. I thought it was solid elegant, concise, and full of that developer pride we all know.

Out of curiosity (and maybe ego), I asked Blackbox AI to generate the same function.

The result?

* Same logic
* Fewer lines
* Better variable names
* Edge case handling I hadn’t even considered
* And a clearer comment block than mine

At first I was like, “Okay, that’s enough, AI.” But honestly? Respect.

This isn’t about giving up control. It’s realizing I don’t have to reinvent the wheel every time. Now I use Blackbox like I’d use Stack Overflow:

* Not always right
* Sometimes weird
* But when it’s right, it saves hours

So I’m curious:

* Has AI ever “out-coded” you?
* Do you refactor its output out of pride, or just leave it since it works?
* Have you caught yourself learning from its suggestions?

As I have been very lonely, maybe this explosive heart showed that I have to pay attention to self love too. That’s how interpreted it.

1mz3mbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mz3mbv/explore_best_coffee_makers_with_cuisinart/,Explore Best Coffee Makers with Cuisinart DCC-1170BKNAS Review,"I decided to test the Cuisinart DCC-1170BKNAS after years of experimenting with various coffee makers that claimed to brew the smoothest cup of coffee. To say I was intrigued by its promises of a classic design with modern programmability would be an understatement. With a 10-cup thermal carafe, programmable brewing options, and user-friendly features, I had to see if this machine lived up to the hype. After several weeks of making coffee daily (and sometimes twice a day), here's how it fared.

**Beautifully Minimalist Design That Fits Anywhere**  
Starting with its appearance, the sleek, black thermal design of the product is as minimalist as it gets. Measuring 7.97""D x 8.13""W x 14.25""H, it’s surprisingly compact given that it holds a 10-cup thermal carafe. I had no trouble fitting it on my crowded kitchen countertop. It's not flashy but exudes a functional elegance that feels at home in both modern and traditional kitchens. However, the plastic material used in some areas does feel less premium compared to more high-end coffee makers.  

**Strong Points**  
- Sleek, space-saving design with a modern black thermal finish  
- Compact enough for smaller countertops  
- Large 10-cup carafe keeps coffee hot for hours  

[Check Cuisinart DCC-1170BKNAS price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b096l473mk/)  

**Thermal Carafe That Actually Works**  
I’ve tested ""thermal"" carafes in the past, and most of them failed miserably at keeping coffee hot beyond an hour. Much to my surprise, this one kept my brew warm for a solid three hours, and the flavors remained consistent. The ergonomic handle and knuckle guard make pouring comfortable, and the drip-free spout is a small but essential touch to avoid that annoying mess common with many carafes. That said, filling the carafe to maximum capacity does require a bit more care to prevent overflows, especially in the early mornings before the caffeine kicks in.  

**Effortless Programmability and Features Galore**  
The programmable functions elevate this coffee maker to another level. I found the 24-hour programmability incredibly convenient for busy mornings. Setting it up the night before was straightforward using intuitive buttons and a clean LCD display. The Brew Pause feature is a lifesaver. What’s better than sneaking a hot cup mid-cycle? The machine picks up right where it left off, thanks to the 60-second reset memory—a feature I didn’t know I needed until I experienced it.  

In terms of customization, it caters to both lazy mornings and those single-cup moments with its 1-4 cup setting. One thing I appreciated is the reusable gold-tone filter. Not only is it eco-friendly, but the coffee tasted richer compared to paper-filtered brews. Paired with the charcoal water filter, you’re getting some seriously clean-tasting coffee, even if your tap water leaves much to be desired.  

**Merits**  
- The Brew Pause feature adds flexibility to your brewing routine.  
- Programmable functions make mornings hassle-free.  
- Gold-tone filter enhances the flavor profile.  
- Charcoal water filter ensures better-tasting coffee.  

**Slight Learning Curve for Optimal Brewing**  
While I enjoyed most of what this coffee maker had to offer, some aspects weren’t perfect. Getting the grind size and coffee amount right is critical. A slightly too coarse grind left my brew tasting weaker than preferred, and the machine didn’t adjust well the couple of times I experimented with finer grounds. The instructions suggest tweaking these variables, and it does take trial and error to hit the sweet spot. Don’t expect perfection straight out of the box. Additionally, the 10-cup capacity feels tailored to smaller households, and larger families might need to brew multiple rounds.  

**Caveats**  
- The brewing process requires fine-tuning for the best flavor.  
- Larger households might outgrow its 10-cup capacity.  

**Competing Products**  
Before committing to this model, I compared it with similar offerings like the Ninja CE251 and Keurig K-Duo. While Keurig stands out for its single-serve option, it lacks the flavor depth and control of a drip coffee maker. On the other hand, the Ninja CE251 offers hotter brewing temperatures but falls short in keeping coffee warm over time, as its glass carafe requires an active burner. The Cuisinart comes out ahead with its thermal carafe and eco-friendly filter. However, it loses slight points for its average build quality compared to Ninja’s robust plastic. What it lacks in durability, it more than makes up for with additional features, such as programmability and filtered brewing.  

**True Value Without Breaking the Budget**  
The cost-effectiveness of this coffee maker lies in its features. The programmable settings, thermal carafe, and reusable filters are often found in pricier machines, making this model surprisingly accessible. While it may not include a fancy touch display or app controls, it delivers where it truly matters: quality coffee, every single morning. If you're seeking reliable performance without spending a small fortune, this product delivers excellent value for the price range it's in.

1mz3mbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1mz3mbk/one_by_one_by_freida_mcfadden/,One by One By Freida McFadden,"Hey everyone! Just finished a real page-turner and I simply *have* to tell you about it. We’re talking about **One by One By Freida McFadden**, and wow, what a ride! If you're looking for a book that will grab you from the first chapter and refuse to let go, you might want to check it out right here: [One by One By Freida McFadden](https://pdfhive.com/one-by-one-by-freida-mcfadden/). Trust me, this one is a classic Freida McFadden special.

So, what's it all about without giving anything away? Imagine a group of colleagues heading off to a super fancy, remote chalet in the mountains for a corporate retreat. Sounds nice, right? Well, a massive blizzard hits, trapping them all inside. And then, the terror begins. Someone in their group is a killer, and people start to disappear or worse... one by one. Everyone’s a suspect, and the tension just builds and builds until you feel like you’re trapped in that chalet with them! It’s a classic locked-room mystery with a very modern, psychological edge.

Now, let's talk about what really worked for me. First off, the **pacing** in this book is incredibly fast. Freida McFadden is an absolute master at ending chapters on a cliffhanger, making it almost impossible to put the book down. I swear I kept telling myself, ""Just one more chapter,"" and suddenly it was 2 AM. The **writing style** is super straightforward and easy to get into, which I really appreciate. No overly flowery language, just pure, unadulterated suspense.

The **twists** in ""One by One"" are another highlight. Just when you think you’ve figured things out, BAM! McFadden pulls the rug right out from under you. It’s a genuinely shocking read, and I loved feeling that sense of surprise and disbelief. The **characters**, while some might feel a bit stereotypical for a thriller (you know, the annoying boss, the quiet one, the ambitious employee), were distinct enough that you could keep track of them and their motives – or lack thereof. The remote, snow-covered chalet setting was also perfect for creating that isolated, paranoid atmosphere. It really made me feel the chills, both from the cold and the fear!

Was there anything I didn't absolutely adore? Well, like with many thrillers that rely heavily on twists, sometimes the motivations of the characters felt *a little* stretched at times to make the plot work. And the ending, while totally jaw-dropping, did require a tiny bit of suspension of disbelief. But honestly, these are minor quibbles when the rest of the book delivers such a thrilling experience. You pick up a Freida McFadden book for the wild ride, and this one delivers in spades!

So, would I recommend **One by One By Freida McFadden**? A resounding YES! If you're a fan of psychological thrillers, locked-room mysteries, or just love a book that keeps you guessing until the very last page, then you absolutely need to add this to your list. It's a perfect read for a cozy weekend when you want to be completely absorbed in a story. It’s especially great for those who love authors like Agatha Christie but want a modern, more visceral feel.

### A Little Guide for New Readers (and a Pep Talk!)

1mz3m4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceireland/comments/1mz3m4h/cant_get_susi_grant_as_wasnt_living_in_a/,Can't get SUSI grant as wasn't living in a registered house last year despite proof,"Hello,

  
I am going back to college as a mature student this year. For the SUSI grant I am applying as an independent mature student. I have lived outside of my home since 2018. Working full time since 2021. In June 2023 after the rent freeze was lifted, my landlord raised the rent overnight and I couldn't afford it with my salary at the time, so I had to leave the house. I moved into my Girlfriends house full time. It was a strange living situation where the landlord was a family friend of hers and was helping a few of her friends out who couldn't get a house for a small time. But it ended up being longer. I left the house in OCT 2024 after moving to Copenhagen for work (I work in food), and didn't find a new house as I was supposed to move abroad quicker, and couldn't find a place that wasn't less than a years contract. But the cost of living stalled me a few months (despite quitting alcohol, coffee, cigarettes etc )

I gathered up all the information I could get living abroad which I will state now:

  
1: A letter from Dublin City Council that shows I was registered to vote in that house since May 24. (it's a government body)

2. A letter from my work saying when I worked there I was living at said Address. 

3. A letter from my Dublin Doctor saying my address is based there.

4. Proof of deliveries addressed to the address in my name

5.  Screenshots of me paying my girlfriend every month and her paying the landlord

6. A letter signed by the landlord saying that I was living with him for 2024, when I was struggling to find a place to live. (I am trying to get an Affidavit from him but he is on holidays until Oct, my deadline to appeal the rejection is 4th Sep.)

7. A external reference from my local Town Councillor saying he knows my family and knows I was living and paying rent independently in Dublin in 2024.

8. My work contract in 2024 and that it was a food based on site job, unable to be done from home (I live 2 hours away from Dublin near the boarder) and proof of my home address (not dublin)



I sent them all away to SUSI and they said they decline my request this week because I don't have a copy of a tenacy agreement or any utility bills in my name. I have rung SUSI about 8 times this month to try and see what I can do but they are so strict. I have also rang Citizens information. This is a course I deferred from last year, as I wanted another year to save up some money, since I have only been out of college 4 years instead of 5, I have to pay the tuition fees. So now I have spent all my month paying my college fees and I am now broke and am incredibly stressed and dont even know how to pay rent, live in Cork this year. ( My home is 6 hours drive from Cork City.)

If anyone has any advice. My mum is due to retire next year so I can't expect them to take out a loan for me. Anyone have any advice on student Loans. I have always paid taxes, I have never been on the dole. I am worried I will have to cancel the college decision.

1mz3jmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerOnReviews/comments/1mz3jmn/explore_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker_with/,Explore the best pour over coffee maker with Hario V60 review,"The Hario V60 Metal Coffee Dripper, model VDM-02HSV, has quickly become a staple in my daily coffee brewing routine. As someone who takes their coffee seriously, I was eager to see what all the hype was about. After spending ample time using this pour-over coffee maker, I’ll say this much — there’s plenty to like about it, but there are also some limitations that coffee enthusiasts should consider.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The metallic finish on the dripper is downright stunning. It’s modern, sleek, and feels robust in hand without being excessively heavy. Its compact size makes it easy to store, and at just 4.9 ounces, it’s remarkably lightweight for a metal product. The cone-shaped design, paired with spiral ridges inside, maximizes water flow consistency. This detail isn’t just for aesthetics; it ensures even extraction of coffee grounds. However, I did find myself wishing the base was slightly broader for more stability on certain mugs. While the design radiates quality and elegance, a touch more practicality wouldn’t have hurt.

**Brewing Performance**  
This dripper provides exceptional control over the brewing process. Its ability to influence flow, timing, and temperature is impressive, making it perfect for those who love to experiment with variables. I experimented with different grind sizes and pour patterns, only to realize how forgiving it is when nailing the perfect cup. The coffee layers flow beautifully to the center, bathing the coffee grounds just right. On days when I’m half-asleep, though, the reliance on precise pouring feels like both a pro and a con. You get out what you put in.

**Easy to Clean and Use**  
I’ll admit, I didn’t expect the Hario V60 to be as low-maintenance as it turned out to be. The metal finish wipes clean effortlessly, which is invaluable during busy mornings. Additionally, it doesn’t require any fancy cleaning equipment. Just a quick rinse under tap water, and it’s ready for the next brewing session. However, the required paper filters are a bit finicky to set into place. On a hectic day, juggling between coffee prep and wrangling filters can feel slightly tedious. 

[Check Hario VDM-02HSV price on Amazon.](https://mgplab.com/p/b00bd1n8wc/)

**Target Audience**  
This dripper feels like it was crafted for the coffee purists out there. If you’re someone who geek outs over craft brewing and appreciates precision, you’ll likely love what this manual coffee maker has to offer. Conversely, if you prefer simplicity and automation, it could feel like too much effort. I experimented with family members who are less particular about their morning coffee, and their feedback was mixed. While some enjoyed the hands-on vibe, others missed the ease of a traditional coffee machine.

**Strengths**  
- Stunning and durable metallic design  
- Exceptional control over brewing variables  
- Lightweight yet sturdy construction  
- Effortless cleanup, ideal for quick reuse  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Paper filters can be tricky to set up  
- Base could be wider for enhanced stability  
- Manual brewing isn’t ideal if you’re in a rush  

**Product Rivals**  
The Hario V60 doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and it’s always interesting to compare it to competitors. The Chemex, for instance, offers a similar pour-over method but doubles as a carafe. While the Hario V60 excels in portability and precision, the Chemex has a more elegant all-in-one design, though it’s bulkier. On the other hand, the Kalita Wave boasts flat-bottom filters, which simplify brewing for beginners but lack the depth of customization that the V60 provides. This product stands out due to its lightweight build and ability to cater to advanced brewers, though others might gravitate towards simplicity elsewhere.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
When it comes to its price point, I feel this Hario dripper offers solid value. Sure, it’s not the cheapest coffee brewing accessory out there, but considering the craftsmanship, material quality, and precision brewing it offers, it feels worth the spend. Comparing it to cheaper plastic drippers, the metallic build presents a great sense of longevity and an elevated brewing experience. While it won’t replace all coffee methods, it’s a small investment for those passionate about exploring pour-over coffee. If you’re serious about your caffeine and brewing process, this is something you’ll eventually wonder how you lived without.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The transparent construction of these dust covers, made from high-quality polyethylene (PE), is a thoughtful touch I didn’t know I needed. Without even touching or lifting the cover, I can easily spot which appliance is under it. No more guessing games or rummaging around on the countertops! The material feels thick and durable for something labeled as disposable, and I didn’t notice any tears or punctures while fitting them over my blender, air fryer, and coffee maker. While not the most eye-catching product, its primary focus is practicality, and it delivers. Its elasticized bands hug appliances snugly, making sure dust and grime don’t stand a chance. 

**Ease of Use**  
I didn’t expect covers to be so quick and painless to use. The elastic band design means I don’t wrestle with them when putting them on oddly shaped appliances like my toaster oven or slow cooker. Even my coworker, who borrows my kitchen for quick recipe experiments, found these dust covers idiot-proof. The multiple size options are an unexpected luxury, allowing me to pick the perfect fit for each appliance. It saves time and effort, especially in a bustling kitchen where convenience matters.

**Versatile Applications**  
Beyond protecting my kitchen gadgets, I’ve found these dust covers to be surprisingly versatile. My partner decided to use one to wrap a delicate lamp during a recent renovation project, while my kids commandeered a few for school art projects (apparently “everything is a canvas” in their minds). I’ve even experimented with covering furniture corners or seasonal household items like string lights not in use. It’s like having a toolbox of dust-protection at your disposal.

**Strengths**  
These simple dust covers come with several handy benefits:  
- Elasticized design ensures a snug fit for appliances of varying shapes and sizes.  
- Transparent material provides visibility, saving time when sorting appliances.  
- Comes in four sizes in one pack, making it highly versatile.  

**Areas of Concern**  
Of course, no product dominates the market without its share of drawbacks. These covers—while packed with merits—have a few aspects to consider:  
- Being disposable, they aren’t a sustainable option for those striving for an eco-friendly kitchen.  
- The potential for tears increases when covering anything with sharp edges or protrusions.  
- While functional, they lack any fire-resistant properties, so caution is needed near stoves or ovens.

**Product Contenders**  
Several alternatives exist for those on the hunt for appliance dust covers. Compared to solid reusable fabric covers, these polyethylene options excel in convenience and visibility but can’t compete in terms of sustainability. Reusable covers like the ones made from waterproof fabric tend to offer superior resistance to wear and tear, especially for daily or heavy-duty kitchens. However, such alternatives often lack elasticity, meaning you may struggle with tight or unusually-shaped items. On the other hand, stretchable plastic wrap can substitute in a pinch, but it isn’t as durable or easy to remove without waste.

**Value Proposition**  
The real question is whether investing in these dust covers justifies the cost when there are reusable options or plain cling wrap already lying around the kitchen. While prices fluctuate, the pack comes with 40 pieces in multiple sizes, ensuring months of use even with heavy demand. Their combination of transparency, elasticity, and versatility makes them a strong contender in the affordability department. If you’re thinking about maintaining a dust-free kitchen without the hassle of repetitive cleaning or unstylish permanent covers, this disposable option offers solid bang-for-buck performance.

I glued up the top yesterday, checked it out today, and good lord it's heavy. When I think about doubling the weight of the top (because the bottom shelf), this thing is just going to be absurdly heavy.

So, this has me considering removing some material from underneath to cut some weight. I'd leave the edges alone to keep the same look.

My thought was to do a bunch of plunge cuts with a track saw, and maybe remove 5/8"" and leave 1"" left. This seems faster than using a router/flattening jig.

1) Should I be concerned about removing material like this? I don't see how it would impact wood movement or anything, but wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything.

However, I think it's time for an upgrade. The C2 will become my work grinder while I get something better for my home.

Currently deciding between the ZP6 vs the Kingrinder K6. I was originally dead set on going for the ZP6 as I tend to find myself enjoying longer ratio (1:17 - 1:18), more tea-like brews (I usually grind between 18-20 clicks on my C2). However recently I've been really into some funky, heavily processed beans from Monogram. They seem to roast a bit more developed, more in the Medium range. I have some worries about how the ZP6 would do with these beans. I do also enjoy light roast washed Ethiopian and Kenyan beans a lot though, and it seems ZP6 really likes these types of beans.

The K6 seems like a great all-around option and from research it seems to provide a more ""coffee"" like cup, and more forgiving. It probably will be a step up from my C2 in terms of taste, but would it be a big enough difference to warrant the upgrade compared to the ZP6 which seems to be something that's much more distinct?",1,1756060205.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1mz3cl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamIntentionAcademy/comments/1mz3cl4/day_25_money_resources/,Day 25 • Money & Resources,"If you are working on expanding your money and resources, here are some of the best teachers and a few quotes from their books. Each believed in the power of the mind to create your reality.

---

### **Wallace D. Wattles — *The Science of Getting Rich* (1910)**  
1. “There is a thinking stuff from which all things are made… A thought in this substance produces the thing that is imaged by the thought.”  
2. “By thought, the thing you want is brought to you. By action, you receive it.”  
3. “You must form a clear and definite mental picture of what you want; you cannot transmit an idea unless you have it yourself.”  

---

### **Charles F. Haanel — *The Master Key System* (1912)**  
1. “The law of attraction is the law by which thought correlates with its object.”  
2. “Every thought produces an impression on the mind. Every impression is a seed which will sprout and bear fruit.”  
3. “The world within creates the world without. What you think in secret is manifested openly.”  

---

### **Napoleon Hill — *Think and Grow Rich* (1937)**  
1. “Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve.”  
2. “Thoughts are things. Powerful things, when mixed with definiteness of purpose, persistence, and a burning desire for their translation into riches.”  
3. “When riches begin to come, they come so quickly, in such great abundance, that one wonders where they have been hiding during all those lean years.”  

---

### **Earl Nightingale — *The Strangest Secret* (1956)**  
1. “We become what we think about.”  
2. “People with goals succeed because they know where they are going.”  
3. “Your world is a living expression of how you are using — and have used — your mind.”  

---

### **Bob Proctor — *You Were Born Rich* (1984)**  
1. “See yourself living in abundance and you will attract it. It always works, it works every time with every person.”  
2. “Thoughts become things. If you see it in your mind, you will hold it in your hand.”  
3. “Faith and fear both demand you believe in something you cannot see. You choose.”  

---

✨ Together, these voices form a straight line through history to one of my favorites, Bob Proctor.

**Wattles → Haanel → Hill → Nightingale → Proctor** 

Each one echoing the same truth: *your thoughts shape your money, your resources, your life.*  

After meeting Bob Procter, I was inspired to write my own manifestation code based on one of his mantras for creating more prosperity: 

“I’m so happy and grateful, now that money and resources easily come to me, through multiple sources, on a frequent and continuous basis.”

I repeat this every morning while drinking my coffee. Maybe you can make your own version. Repetition is the key to changing the conscious mind. The unconscious mind cannot tell the difference between reality and imagination. If you imagine your dreams frequently enough, your reality will change.

Room Available in Church Hill – Oct 10th Move-In

Hey friends! I have a room opening up in my 3 bed / 2.5 bath duplex in Church Hill starting October 10th. This is a 1 year lease - not a sublet 

About the house
 • Duplex with just one shared wall (our neighbor is lovely—we even garden together!)
 • Rent: $866 + utilities (usually $100-150 depending on the season)
 • master bedroom with your own private attached bath. Huge space and closet. 
 • Cozy porch + garden space
 • washer/dryer - dishwasher - central AC - updated kitchen - hardwood floors throughout 

We’re one block from Chimborazo Park—perfect for morning walks, picnics, or catching the sunset over the city. It’s also an easy stroll to local coffee shops, bakeries, and restaurants, plus quick access to bus lines and downtown.

Both of my current roommates are moving into a place together (sad for me, happy for them), so I’m looking to fill the last room—one other roommate is already lined up. We’re both artists, so creatives are very welcome! 

Who this might be perfect for
 • Young professional in their mid-to-late 20s
 • Sober (we both are)
 • Non-smoker preferred, but porch smoking is fine
 • both my roommate and I are trans/queer and would prefer living with fellow community members. No cis men please

I'm looking forward to cooler days ahead when I can possibly work from somewhere else like my front porch or the patio of the local coffee shop.

Pilot ‘Floral Coral’ Elite <14K F nib> -$50
I bought this pen from this sub, and it is a super smooth writer. It would be a great entry pen for trying out a gold nib, especially if you like this color. I hardly used it after putting in the cartridge - if you buy this you can let me know if you’d like me to keep the cartridge in when I send it out. I can alternatively clear the cartridge for you and clean out the pen before I send it. I can include an unused Con40 converter for $5 extra. If you’re interested, you can find the previous person’s post searching for ‘pilot elite floral coral’ 

——

TWSBI Eco Creme + Rose Gold <F> : $30
I bought this one just last week on this sub but I ended up buying another of the same pen, but with a custom grind nib 😅 so I’m letting this one go. I inked it with Ferris Wheel Press Queen Allium, and I can leave it in there if you’d like me to, or I can clean it out.

——

This one is not priced to sell given that I’m only putting it up sort of out of obligation since I feel I’m not giving it the attention it deserves 😅

TCMC X Esterbrook Estie with custom nib grind <Reverse Architect> by Kirk Speer - $250 

This pen writes with needlepoint (thinner than EF)  on the normal side and with Architect on the reverse (thin lines on vertical stroke and thick lines on side horizontal).

It would come with the original box (minus the stickers which I’ve used 😅). If you look at my profile I posted a video with the pen along with a writing sample. It is gorgeous and I want to keep it just to look at it once in a while, but I think I’d rather spend the money on a pen I’d use often, as well.

——

I definitely have more inks I don’t need, but I’ll start with listing these two:

- TCMC X Esterbrook: Forgotten Iced Coffee. I used it to ink the above noted pen, once: $10

- Ferris Wheel Press: Tides of Midas. Only used to swatch before I realized I don’t like it at all: $10

1mz33n1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mz33n1/aita_for_making_my_wedding_inaccessible_to_my/,AITA for making my wedding inaccessible to my friend with ASD?,"I (26F) have been friends with ‘Lucy’ (27F) since we were 5 and 6 and her family moved in next door to mine. Lucy has autism and has significant sensory issues, and struggles with loud noises and bright lights, but we’ve never let it affect our friendship. She’s genuinely funny and thoughtful and everything else you’d want in a friend. We’ve never really had any issues in our relationship until this point as we’ve always been respectful of each other’s boundaries, and I’m always happy to meet up with Lucy at a coffee shop or even at home, because I understand how stressful some environments can be for her.

Lucy got married in 2023, and her wedding was very different to a conventional wedding. There was no music, she was married in a plain white dress that she felt comfortable in (and she still looked stunning), and the reception was more of a gathering, with everyone going home by 10 as Lucy felt overstimulated. I’m glad that Lucy enjoyed her day, and the ceremony was beautiful, but if I’m being completely honest, the wedding wasn’t necessarily enjoyable, and if Lucy wasn’t one of my oldest friends I might have left before the night was over.

I am getting married to my wonderful fiancée, ‘Sarah’ (30F) in October. We’re both true maximalists, and are really excited to have the dream wedding we’ve been looking forward to since the summer of last year, when Sarah proposed to me. We’ve found an absolutely beautiful venue that allows music into the early hours of the morning (rare where I live), and we can’t wait. Lucy didn’t have bridesmaids, but I wanted her to be one of mine, so I invited her to the dress fitting along with four other girls I had chosen to be my bridesmaids. She said that she’d love to be a bridesmaid but she felt like spending a day trying a load of different dresses on sounded like her idea of hell, which I understood and therefore didn’t press her on. She told me she’d be happy with whatever we picked in the end, and asked me to send on a picture of the dress we landed on. Me and my other four bridesmaids fell in love with a blush pink silky maxi dress and they all looked absolutely beautiful wearing them.

When I sent the link to the dress to Lucy, she immediately responded saying that they wouldn’t do given that they were silky and wouldn’t feel right on her skin. It was obviously slightly frustrating, but I knew what I was signing up for when I chose Lucy as one of my bridesmaids. I sent her our number two choice, which is of a nicer material, which she seemed happy with, and everything was fine until this morning, when I sent out a link to all my close friends and family to add songs of their choice to the wedding playlist. She told me she didn’t know there was going to be music at the wedding, and that she felt like that would be overstimulating for her. She also told me that she’d been waiting to ask me to cut down the guest list, which is 200 people strong, not including plus ones, as she felt that our venue would be crowded and busy. I told her that I felt like those requests were unreasonable, as I’d been planning my dream wedding for a year now, and I wasn’t willing to give up music, dancing, and other loved ones just to make one friend feel accommodated.

She again asked me if I’d consider having a wedding like hers, where it was quiet and it finished early, as she wanted to be there for the whole thing. I told her that I was honoured that she wanted to support me all the way through my wedding, and her own wedding was beautiful, but it wasn’t my style. I also reminded her that the actual ceremony would only be immediate family and friends, so she was welcome and would feel comfortable watching me and Sarah actually get married.

We went back and forth like this over text for a while, with her continually telling me she wanted to be present at the reception, before she eventually called me and asked me why it was so hard to just accommodate her needs, and I snapped. I told her that I didn’t want a sad beige wedding like hers was (which I now regret) and I wanted my wedding to actually be fun, and that I’d already bent to her will in picking new bridesmaids dresses because she didn’t feel comfortable in the ones that I and the other four bridesmaids had chosen. She began crying and told me that I clearly didn’t care about her enough to want to include her in my wedding, so I hung up on her to give myself some time to think.

I regret raising my voice at her and I understand that sometimes her thought processes differ from mine, but I equally think that it’s unreasonable to change my wedding, and that Lucy should understand as an adult that the world doesn’t revolve around her.

About an hour ago, I got off the phone with my mum, who is best friends with Lucy’s mum, and she was upset with me and told me that Lucy had said I was actively excluding her from the wedding and was making it inaccessible because I didn’t want her there. I’m unbelievably angry that she’s trying to turn my own family against me because she can’t come to my wedding reception. I’m also aware that shes been texting my other bridesmaids, telling them what happened from her perspective and trying to get them to ‘talk sense’ into me. Luckily, my girls had my back and have all told her that I can do what I want for my wedding. Sarah has suggested completely uninviting her given that she might make a scene or try and twist the story to make me seem like a monster, but I do still love Lucy and I’m not sure where to go from here, because I can’t tell if she genuinely doesn’t understand why I wouldn’t have a wedding without 75% of my guests and with no music, or if shes being intentionally problematic. I’ve texted her to meet tomorrow to go over things properly, but she hasn’t seen my message yet. Anyway, AITA?

TL;DR: My autistic friend with sensory issues had no music at her wedding and only invited 50 people, now she wants me to do the same so that she can be included, but my partner and I want to have a big wedding.",11,1756059441.0,AITAH,38,0.92,False

We are unionizing at work and will see a significant increase in pay that gave me the confidence to go out. I went to a karaoke bar and from the advice of a friends gf, went up to a girl and got her number.

This was Friday, it’s Sunday now, is it a good time to text? In the past I’ve been a horrible texter, I’ve caught myself sending way too long of texts bc Idk what’s normal, like would it be ok for me to reach out, then when she replies see if she is available the next day I’m available to get a coffee or drink? I am confident I can hold good conversation in person and take her on a nice first date, my biggest concern is when and what to text? Like do I hold a convo? Do I just cut to the point? Then, let’s say we plan something for 4 days from now, do I need to text her during that or should I just leave it at “cool I’ll reach out then! Looking forward to it 😁” or something? like I said I’ve been out of the game two years and all advice is welcome!",1,1756059421.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Reason: I recently traveled to Portland and went to Proud Mary, a coffee restaurant where they have all kinds of beans from across the world and a pretty big menu for different ways to try them, including different arrangements of flights. It was like going to a whiskey bar in that there are different tasting experiences and a wide range of product from the affordable to $50 drinks. 

At Proud Mary, my wife and I shared a flight of pour over coffees. It came with a card for each coffee explaining the origin, farmers, roasting techniques, and other elements of each coffee. By the end, not only was the experience fun but it allowed me to make well informed decisions on what to buy next. 

After doing that I figured we would have something similar in OC but after searching around Yelp, I really couldn't find anything. There are plenty of great coffee shops but they generally only have 1-3 different beans at a time and really no great way of sampling a wide range (but often more bags to take home).

Context: okay, so let me set the scene for you, im in a friend group with 5 other girls pero ang relevant lang naman sa story ay ako, friend A and friend B pero keep in mind friend C and D. Kaming lima, we have been friends for almost 3 years na and typical ang friendship namin, super close ganon. Etong si Friend A, may ex sya 4 years ago (lets call him ***Boy***), and kaya sila nag break dahil he cheated on her for like the nth time with 5 other girls (malandi si Boy, kala mo naman gwapo).

So, everyone moved on na and Friend A and si Boy they had new relationships na so thats that. Etong si Boy and new GF (lets call her Jo) nya was on/off for like around a year na then June this year they were really over na. Last month (July 26, 2025) etong si Boy he was at a event and coincidence na andun din bago ni Jo, tapos biglang nag wala wala si Boy halos gusto nya na patayin yung bago ni Jo to the point na ang dami na umawat sakanya since fresh breakup and may bago na si Jo. Prior to this pala (same day rin), si Boy ay gumawa ng dump account sa tiktok and he messaged Jo, technically begging for them to get back together and pinagmmura nya ganon na she betrayed him kasi she got with someone new.

Lets dive in sa relationship ni Boy and Jo, so she is one year younger than him and from the get go parang weak ang foundation ng RS nila. Boy was manipulating Jo and he was really controlling like sa mga sinsuot nya (e sya nga mismo buong IG feed nya girls na naka bikini, lol) and the people she surrounds her self with. To the point na yung parents ni Jo interfered and pinapastop yung RS nila kasi Boy is really bad for Jo.

Now, you have a backround na kay Boy na he is really aggressive and manipulator.

So ngayon etong si Boy, after that event he 'SUDDENLY' likes someone new like down bad sya and was willing to do anything for her and turns out eto si Friend B!! He suddenly cared about Friend B and was doing things for her like buying her lunch, coffee and hinahatid sa bahay ni Friend B kahit gabi (may kasama naman na iba inside the car, hindi pumapayag si Friend B na silang dalawa lang). They were talking na rin halos every day sa mess pero Boy was initiating the convo and Friend B was like sumasakay lang sa trip ni Boy. Akala ni Boy hindi alam ni Friend B na alam nyang gusto nya sya kasi akala nya ganon ka dense si Friend B. Pero si Friend B, alam nya na kasi mga friends ni Boy parang nagssnitch sakanya.

Fast forward to August 20, inaya ni Boy si Friend B na mag cafe kasama si Friend C & D and si Friend C may dinalawang jowa so bale lima sila dun. After this cafe thing nila, hinatid ni Boy silang lahat at linast si Friend B so this is the first time na silang dalawa lang kasi diba nga before may kasama sila always sa car. IDK ano nangyari or pinagusapan nila sa car.

Background again, ako, pinagsabihan ko na si Friend B from the start na si Boy ay up to NO GOOD! Lahat ng kwento ay kinwento ko na sakanya so hindi ako nagkulang pagsabihan sya, and halos same kami ng view kay Boy na playboy ganon and she made it seem na he had no chance. Pero ofc, as her friend sabi ko if ever man magbago tingin nya sakanya, i would support them, i was always there for her and she should never hesitate to tell me anything.

Side note: nagusap si Friend A and Friend B and sabi ni Friend A okay lang naman daw kasi ex nya na si Boy so no problem on her side. Pero ofc, alam na ni Friend A kung anong capabilities ni Boy since she herself experiencd it first hand.

Then ngayon may nag sabi saakin na etong si Friend B naffall na sya kay Boy, and i didnt know anything about this kasi etong si Friend B, C and D ay may GC na silang 3 and pinaguusapan si Friend B and Boy and parang kinukunsinti nila sya like todo ship sila sakanila (out of the picture na kami ni Friend A). OFC, nung nalaman kong may new GC sila nakakahurt kasi they thought i wouldnt be comfortable or support Boy and Friend B when ever since i made sure they can always tell me anything.

Yung nagsabi sakin na naffall na si Friend B kay Boy, he is a friend of Boy pero hindi sya enabler. Nagusap kami for a long time and i found out he doesnt like them together since Friend B is so innocent and if ever, this will be her first relationship. Sabi ko sa kausap ko na im just really scared na Boy will break my friends heart kasi i was with Friend A all throughout their relationship and breakup and it was so bad. And sabi ng kausap ko rin na si Boy daw ay mabait sa mga Girls (ONLY) to get them, magaling sya sa actions pero master sya mag manipulate and love bombing people.

So i texted Friend B kanina if like she likes si Boy na and sabi nya nagguluhan pa daw sya as of now since si yung actions ni Boy ay nakakafall ganon and she started having like feelings ig for Boy after they went sa cafe. I was like asking her if she knows mga past issues ni boy (IK na she knows pero baka nakalimutan nya kasi BAKIT SYA MAFFALL SA GANON??) and sabi nya oo pero she was taking too long to respond so i figured ayaw nya yung topic namin. Habang magkausap kami Friend B and Friend C ay naka VC and parang nappansin ko sa replies ni Friend B na naiinis sya sakin....? Then i asked her if she was uncomfortable na pinaguusapan namin silang dalawa and sabi nya yes. So i said okayy then i didnt text her na.

What do i do? Ako ba ang mali na nakialam ako? huhu help me out pls!! should i ask Friend B is okay lang kami? or pabayaan ko muna and see how things play out

\*\*\*HINDI SA NANG JJUDGE AKO PERO HINDI AKO SINUNAGLING, PANGIT TALAGA SI BOY HUHU SO ANG KAPAL NG MUKHA NYA MAGING CHEATER!",0,1756059406.0,adviceph,7,0.5,False

The Norwex Cleaning Paste has quickly become one of my top go-to solutions for those never-ending cleaning challenges at home. It's a small container, but don’t let that fool you—this product packs a serious punch. The minute I opened it and took a look at the solid, condensed paste, I had doubts. However, after adding a bit of water and rubbing it onto a damp microfiber cloth, the magic began. Whether it was tackling stubborn grease in the kitchen or giving chrome fixtures a like-new shine, this paste did not disappoint.

**Good Points**

- Cleans and polishes a variety of surfaces effectively—chrome, porcelain, stainless steel, and even aluminum.  
- Highly concentrated, making it last much longer than liquid alternatives.  
- Gentle enough for delicate items like coffee pots and food-ware products.

**Surprisingly Versatile Cleaning Power**

What truly stood out to me was the versatility. I’ve used this paste on everything from countertops to my grimy outdoor BBQ grill, and it always delivered impressive results. It’s one of those products that transitions smoothly between different rooms and surfaces. Even my glass stovetop, which usually requires a specialized cleaner, came out spotless. This was a game-changer for me since I hate juggling multiple cleaning products. Surprisingly, just a tiny amount of paste on my damp cloth was enough to clean large areas. It’s as economical as it is powerful.

**Ease of Use and Application**

Using the cleaning paste felt pretty straightforward. Simply wetting a microfiber cloth, rubbing it lightly over the surface of the paste, and applying it on whatever dirty spot needed attention was all it took. There’s a certain satisfaction in seeing tough stains literally disappear under your hand. However, it’s important to note that consistency plays a role—too much water might dilute the paste too quickly, so stick to a damp cloth rather than a soaking wet one. The texture becomes creamy when mixed just right, making application smooth and efficient.

**Chemical Safety and Sustainability**

One of the better aspects of this product is its biodegradable formula. As someone who tries to minimize harmful chemicals in my home, the Norwex Cleaning Paste fits the bill nicely without compromising cleaning strength. Plus, it never left behind any harsh chemical odors, which I appreciated as someone sensitive to synthetic fragrances. 

That said, you do have to be cautious about the materials you use it on. The packaging explicitly warns against using it on brass, silver, or brushed stainless steel. While it excelled on most surfaces, I accidentally tested it on brushed stainless steel, and let’s just say that was… a lesson learned. The scratches weren’t severe, but they were noticeable.

**Alternative Offerings**

Compared to other cleaning solutions like Bar Keepers Friend or even baking soda, the Norwex Cleaning Paste stood out due to its longevity. While Bar Keepers Friend is effective, I always feel like I’m using too much to get similar results, and it certainly doesn’t last as long as this paste. On the other hand, baking soda, my usual stain-busting companion, lacks the polish that Norwex manages to impart on shiny surfaces. It’s essentially the difference between “clean” and “sparkling.”

That said, there’s no denying that the Norwex paste is on the pricier side. It’s best suited for someone who wants an all-in-one solution, rather than cobbling together multiple products for specialized cleaning tasks.

**Areas of Concern**

- Not ideal for all materials and specifically warned against use on brushed stainless steel, brass, or silver.  
- Price might feel steep if you’re on a tight budget, though its concentration makes it last longer than expected.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**

In my opinion, this product’s quality justifies its cost when you break it down over long-term use. A little bit truly goes far, which cuts down on the frequency of repurchasing compared to liquid cleaners. Moreover, its ability to clean multiple types of surfaces means I’m buying fewer bottles of specialized cleaners. Factoring in how eco-friendly it is and the absence of strong chemical smells, the value becomes even more apparent.

I (19) always used to hear my friends mentioning his name throughout high school, and we have very similar names so i always thought they were calling me whenever his name is mentioned. But even then i knew he was so funny, never heard something bad about him, and about a year ago, my friends created a group chat for one of us' birthday, we were at the same groupchat and he asked me who i was, said hi and that was pretty much all, at the birthday, we were sitting at a very wide table so i was at the end of the table and he was at the other end, we didn't talk also i left early because they needed me at home, but i was curious about him really, because we had similar interests and kind of similar taste, i wanted to study music and he was studying instrument making, we didnt talk after that (i dont even follow his ig), this was again like august, last year, later we meet again at another friend's birthday party, at april, we kinda talk this time, i drank a cup of coffee, he did fortune telling by my coffee, and later we were walking, i mean with everyone who was at party, i was walking side by my friend's sister who is 5 years younger than me, he said we are practically the same height, and i said no, then compared it with my hand, then smiled, i think at that very time i started to have a crush on him, i smiled looking into his eyes, and then he chuckled. After a short while he left, again, we didnt talk after that, that day i was very, very excited i dont know why because i knew i wasnt going to see him, days go by and i forget about him partially, thats kind of because i tried to and wanted to forget him, its because we are kinda at the same friend group and i dont want to ruin things for myself and my friends by telling them i had a crush on him and also i had a really important exam at the end of the june so... i succeeded partially, but we didnt see each other till this friday, the same friend's birthday again, he is doing an internship so he was a little late, i was a little excited whole week till that day, he greeted everyone then greeted me, he hugged everyone but i was so excited i didnt know what to do, i shake his hand instead, then devastated about it because he seemed surprised about why i didnt hug him for a second, we were at a yacht, he was giving little infos about ships and sea itself, and I JUST DO THIS SO MUCH AND HE DOES IT TOO AND I WAS COMPLETELY GONE, then they played the music, it was not a slow song, everyone was jumping and stuff and i didnt knew the song so i was sitting, and the same friend's sister too, he came and started to jumping with her, then came to me and leaned his hand, i hold it and we danced and jumped together, i swear that was the best moment ive had in my life since like 4 years. after the yacht, one of my friends told him if he wants to go to eat something and he said ok, but then he left, and we were going to meet (as a group) this saturday but he said he will be out of town, i dont want to wait till april to see him, best chance btw, my heart beats faster since the day i saw him and i cant stop myself, i feel relaxed by seeing the pictures we took at the yacht, he is in my dreams since friday, i dont even follow his ig, just wanted to tell somewhere thank you for reading, i wanted to talk to him so much but i was too excited also my friends are completely against these stuff in the friend group",2,1756059279.0,Crush,0,1.0,False
