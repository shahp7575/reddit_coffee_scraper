I just moved to Kingston a week ago and figured I‚Äôd shoot my shot here since I don‚Äôt really know anyone in the city yet. I graduated from McMaster last year and work remotely now, so my schedule‚Äôs pretty flexible.

I‚Äôm hoping to meet people around my age who are down to hang out, grab coffee, explore the waterfront, or just chill. Some things I‚Äôm into:

Working out üí™

Soccer ‚öΩÔ∏è (huge fan, always down for a game)

Gaming üéÆ

Movies & trying new things

I work at one of the biggest brokerages in Canada (you get to have a connection with me üòÇ) 

Anything to do with the water ‚Äî jet skis, swimming, or just hanging by the lake üåä

I only noticed because I walk past it every morning on my way to grab coffee downstairs, and when I walk my dog. 

At first, I didn‚Äôt give two f*cks. It‚Äôs obviously asshole behavior of him, but I wasn‚Äôt going to say shit.

THEN one day, I see him cleaning his car in that same spot. I went down to walk my dog and when I came back, he had drove his car away and there was trash EVERYWHERE. This dude just threw all the trash out of his car in the garage.

So I went straight down to the office and let them know.

Ever since then, whenever I see his car in the spot, as I‚Äôm getting my coffee, I tell the front office. They always tag his car with an orange sticker. Every time, he takes the sticker off, rips it up, and sprinkles it all over the parking spot.

Today the front office told me the guy is a true asshole about everything and they said if he parks there again to let them know and they‚Äôll call a tow truck to have it towed.

I wasn‚Äôt going to say anything at first. I just planned on judging this dude. Then he started littering and that pissed me off. So now I snitch on his car anytime I see it and I‚Äôm just hoping they get to tow his car.

Just for context, I'm completely civil and chill on the dating apps and have never gave any reason for any woman to report me on these apps. Never acted like a creep or too aggressive towards anyone ever. I got plenty of in rl dates from all those apps in the past. I suspect the reason I got banned from these apps is cuz I keep deleting and re-making my profile, which I think is the reason. Or some other reason that the algorhythm didn't like.  But it sucks I can't use Tinder, Hinge, CMB and Facebook dating anymore, because I got so much success from those dating apps.

I tried appeals but it didn't work. I know you guys are thinking...Why do I just not go out to bars and clubs and social events like a normal person?

Like, I'm good with 1v1 social interactions and I do well with dating and pulling women but I'm terrible with general social events and gatherings, and loud areas like bars/clubs. I get super reserved and quiet fast. But anyway, that is beside the point and not the question I am asking here.

  
Do you guys recommend any other newer dating apps that I haven't heard about?  Or should I just like change phone numbers and/or phone device and start completely afresh so I can use all those apps again?

Potential Markets:

Malls/Office buildings : So easy for Adam to serve coffee and cover its rental cost plus bring profit and cultural value to the establishment. Small profile allows it to make money with little disruption...could even be used as a guest services robot...also the parts runners could even help with such things as greeting etc. Within offices there could be one in the lobby to generate money for the building maintenance costs. 

Sports stadiums- No Brainer (Adam can serve beer and probably make hotdogs no problem.) 

Pop-up events- Currently this is the market Adam has excelled at. 

Medical landscape- already working on delivery robots and adam looks to be doing something special with medtronic.

Factories and warehouses- already testing these areas and room for massive growth. Parts robots growing.

grocery and convenience- Adam could easily become a cashier and dispense money and cigarettes. Also, the scorpion and other robots have already been in the works within  grocery environments. 

fast food and hospitality- our bread and butter

space exploration- easily have a fixed robot during low gravity for helping astronauts in space. 

Custom ventures- unlimited potential and innovation here...one of the reasons i love richtech (tailor made solutions)

Now we just have to turn these imaginings into reality and we have a company with 1 million leased robots making 1.6 billion a month. thats 19.2 bil a year. ",3,1755736108.0,RichtechRobotics,1,1.0,False

1mvw447,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mvw447,Your Full Warehouse Is a Cash Flow Graveyard. Here's How to Resurrect Your Profits.,"# Caught in the Supply Chain: How Inventory Can Make or Break Your Cash Flow

If you‚Äôre a small business owner, you‚Äôve probably walked through your stockroom or warehouse, looked at shelves brimming with products, and felt a sense of pride and security. It‚Äôs a common feeling. After all, a full warehouse looks like a healthy, thriving business, ready to meet any customer demand that comes its way. But what if I told you that this conventional wisdom is one of the most dangerous assumptions you can make?

In an era of unprecedented **supply chain woes**, that mountain of inventory might not be the asset you think it is. Instead, it could be a silent cash flow killer, slowly and steadily strangling the financial life out of your business. The money tied up in those boxes on those shelves is money that isn‚Äôt in your bank account. It‚Äôs not paying your employees, covering your rent, or funding your next big growth initiative. It‚Äôs just sitting there.

This is the inventory paradox: you need it to make sales, but holding too much of it‚Äîor the wrong kind‚Äîcan be just as catastrophic as not having enough. Understanding how to master this delicate balancing act is no longer just good business practice; it‚Äôs a survival skill. Let‚Äôs dismantle the old assumptions and explore how you can optimize your stock levels to build a more resilient, liquid, and profitable business.

# The Cash Flow Trap: How Inventory Eats Your Money

At its core, the relationship between inventory and cash flow is brutally simple. When you purchase inventory, cash goes out. You only get that cash back‚Äîplus a profit‚Äîwhen the inventory is sold. The time between that initial cash outlay and the final sale is called the **cash conversion cycle**. The longer that cycle, the more financial strain your business is under.

Imagine you own a small online store that sells high-end coffee makers. You find a great deal from a supplier and decide to stock up, buying 100 units at $150 each. That‚Äôs a **$15,000** cash outlay.

* **Week 1:** You sell 10 units. Great start! You‚Äôve made back some of your investment.
* **Month 1:** You‚Äôve sold 30 units in total. You still have 70 coffee makers, representing **$10,500** of your cash, sitting in your stockroom.
* **Month 3:** Sales slow down. You‚Äôve now sold 50 units. You still have **$7,500** tied up in the remaining 50 machines. Meanwhile, your rent is due, you need to pay for a new marketing campaign, and a newer, more popular coffee maker model has just been released by a competitor, making your stock less desirable.

This is the cash flow trap in action. While you might eventually sell all the coffee makers, the cash was unavailable for three months or more. In the world of small business, three months is an eternity. Opportunities are missed, bills become stressful, and the business's ability to pivot or weather a slow season is severely hampered.

# The Hidden Costs of ""Just in Case""

The cost of inventory goes far beyond the initial purchase price. These holding costs, or carrying costs, are the silent partners in the assault on your cash flow. They typically represent **20-30% of your inventory's value** on an annual basis. Let‚Äôs break them down:

* **Storage Costs:** Whether you own your warehouse or rent space, it isn't free. This includes rent or mortgage, utilities, climate control (especially for perishable or sensitive goods), and the salaries of any warehouse staff. The more inventory you have, the more space you need, and the higher these costs climb.
* **Insurance and Taxes:** More inventory means a higher valuation, which leads to higher insurance premiums to protect against theft, damage, or fire. In many jurisdictions, you‚Äôll also pay property taxes on the value of the inventory you hold.
* **Obsolescence:** This is the big one. Tastes change, technology evolves, and seasons end. The trendy product that was flying off the shelves six months ago might be virtually worthless today. Perishable goods can expire. Electronics become outdated. Fashion goes out of style. Every day an item sits on your shelf, the risk of it becoming obsolete increases, forcing you to sell it at a steep discount or write it off as a complete loss.
* **Opportunity Cost:** This is the most overlooked cost of all. The cash tied up in your inventory could have been used for something else. It could have been invested in marketing to attract new customers, used to develop a new product, spent on upgrading your e-commerce website, or simply held in reserve as a cash cushion for emergencies.

When you add up these holding costs, that ""just in case"" inventory starts to look a lot less like a safety net and a lot more like a liability.

# Strategies to Free Your Trapped Cash

Optimizing your inventory isn‚Äôt about slashing your stock to the bone and risking stockouts. It‚Äôs about being strategic. It‚Äôs about holding the *right* amount of the *right* products at the *right* time. Here are some of the most effective strategies small businesses can use to achieve this.

# 1. Embrace Just-in-Time (JIT)... With a Modern Twist

The traditional Just-in-Time model, where you order inventory only as you need it for production or sales, is powerful but can be risky in today‚Äôs volatile supply chain environment. A single delay can halt your entire operation. The modern approach is a hybrid: a **""Just-in-Time, with a buffer.""**

* **Best Practice:** Identify your most critical, fastest-moving products. Work with your suppliers to establish reliable, short lead times for these items. For these A-list products, keep a minimal amount of ""safety stock""‚Äîsay, an extra week or two's worth‚Äîto guard against unexpected delays, but no more. This prevents a massive amount of cash from being tied up in your most expensive inventory.

# 2. Conduct an ABC Analysis

Not all inventory is created equal. An ABC analysis helps you categorize your products based on their value to your business, allowing you to focus your management efforts where they‚Äôll have the biggest impact.

* **Category A:** These are your superstars. They make up a small percentage of your total inventory items (say, 10-20%) but account for a huge percentage of your revenue (70-80%). These are the products you need to manage meticulously. Monitor their stock levels daily, have strong relationships with their suppliers, and never, ever stock out.
* **Category B:** These are your solid performers. They represent a moderate percentage of your inventory items and revenue (e.g., 30% of items, 15% of revenue). You should monitor them regularly, but not with the same intensity as your A-list items.
* **Category C:** These are the vast majority of your products that contribute very little to your bottom line. Think of old products, slow-movers, or low-margin accessories. These items can be ordered less frequently in larger quantities, or you might even consider discontinuing them. The goal is to spend as little time and money managing them as possible.

**Example:** A bookstore might find that the top 50 bestsellers are their 'A' items, a broader collection of popular authors are 'B' items, and the thousands of niche, back-catalogue books are 'C' items. They would manage the bestseller stock obsessively while ordering the 'C' items only when a customer specifically requests them (special order).

# 3. Set Smart Reorder Points and Par Levels

Don‚Äôt rely on guesswork to decide when to reorder. A **reorder point (ROP)** is a specific stock level that triggers a new order. The formula is simple:

**ROP = (Average Daily Sales x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock**

* **Example:** You sell an average of 10 widgets per day. Your supplier‚Äôs lead time is 7 days. You want to keep 3 days' worth of safety stock (30 widgets).
* **Your ROP = (10 widgets/day x 7 days) + 30 widgets = 100 widgets.**
* When your inventory for that item drops to 100 units, you place a new order. This simple calculation removes emotion and ambiguity from the ordering process, dramatically reducing the risk of both stockouts and overstocking.

# 4. Master the Art of Supplier Relationships

Your suppliers are your partners in cash flow management. A strong, collaborative relationship can be a competitive advantage.

* **Negotiate Better Terms:** Don't just focus on the unit price. Can you negotiate longer payment terms, from Net 30 to Net 45 or Net 60? That‚Äôs an extra 15 or 30 days you get to hold onto your cash.
* **Explore Dropshipping or Consignment:** For certain products, especially new or unproven ones, ask if the supplier offers dropshipping (they ship directly to your customer) or consignment (you only pay for the goods after they sell). Both models completely eliminate the need to tie up your cash in inventory upfront.
* **Improve Communication and Transparency:** Share your sales forecasts with your key suppliers. The more visibility they have into your expected demand, the better they can plan their own production and ensure they have stock ready for you when you need it. This can help shorten your lead times.

# 5. Leverage Technology

Managing inventory on a spreadsheet is a recipe for disaster as you grow. Human error, outdated data, and a lack of real-time visibility will inevitably lead to costly mistakes. Modern inventory management software is no longer a luxury; it‚Äôs a necessity.

* **What to Look For:**
   * **Real-Time Tracking:** The system should automatically update stock levels with every sale and return, whether it happens online or in-store.
   * **Automated Ordering:** It should be able to generate purchase orders automatically when inventory hits the reorder points you‚Äôve set.
   * **Forecasting Tools:** Good software uses your historical sales data to help you predict future demand, allowing for more accurate ordering.
   * **Integration:** It must integrate seamlessly with your accounting software (like QuickBooks or Xero) and your e-commerce platform (like Shopify or BigCommerce) to provide a single source of truth for your business data.

# From Trapped to Liquid: Your Final Takeaway

The image of a full warehouse as a symbol of success is a relic of a bygone era. In today's fast-paced, unpredictable market, the truly successful business isn‚Äôt the one with the most stuff, but the one that is the most agile. Agility comes from liquidity, and liquidity comes from cash flow.

By viewing inventory not as a static asset but as a dynamic component of your cash flow cycle, you change the entire game. You stop being a passive storekeeper and become an active financial strategist. You start making smarter, data-driven decisions that reduce waste, minimize risk, and maximize the cash available to fuel your growth.

So take another walk through your stockroom. This time, don‚Äôt just see boxes on a shelf. See the cash they represent. See the opportunities that cash could unlock. Then, get to work liberating it. Your business's future depends on it.

I put up a post recently about worries that students have coming into the leaving cert year. A lot of you replied with many more messaging me so I decided to create something for you.

I created a drive/file for incoming 6th years to help prepare for the upcoming year. It can be a very stressful year and I totally I understand, so I only included the crucials because who wants to read pages and pages about the thing that stresses them out lol.  It includes content like tackling exam season, what to do after the mocks, developing the right mindset and more. The earlier you begin to think about these things, the better your year will go which really helped me.

Knowing the content is one part but preparing yourself is another which I think a lot of people overlook. Right now it's really just the skeleton for what we wanna do/add in the next few weeks. And for the price of a coffee and a sandwich, I dont think it's bad.

[whop.com/clueta](http://whop.com/clueta)

There is the site, we also have a discord where students can talk to and support each other which I think is helpful. If 5th years are looking to join, I would recommend them to.

It's worse on my left hand than my right.

I also seem to have a lot of twitching/shaking when holding something (even light like a coffee cup). It seems to come an ago but DEF. gets worse when im tired/stressed/fatigued (like through exercise). It also happens if I get out of a really hot shower/bath.

everything is fine at rest, and it's been like this for like..10+ years. I had an MRI for headaches but also had this 15 years ago and it was fine.

Another odd thing is if I try to like keep my head really still (like for a picture) it'll sorta twitch. Sometimes my body just feels just twitchy all over internally.

I guess I just need some reassurance. I know it's not PD/ALS (since no progression, and no resting tremor). I do worry about MS but I would've thought by now I would have SOME sort of other symptom.

1mvvy8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/TirzepatidePH/comments/1mvvy8f/3_months_with_tirzepatide/,3 Months with Tirzepatide,"A bit background muna, 3 years na akong diagnosed with T2 diabetes. I've tried everything to lower my blood sugar and weight. Nakadagdag sa weight ko ung implanon ko na tinanggal din this year.

Naglalaro lang sa 80-82 kgs ang weight ko at Obese ako sa height ko na 5'1. dahil dito alaga na ako ng endo and OB ko for 3 years na rin. Gustong gusto na namin ni mister magbaby kaso di pa rin tlga nila ako pinpayagan dahil sa possible complications dahil obese ako and ang taas ng sugar ko :(

Naging pabaya rin ako sa sarili dahil nagkapera, siging order ng kape na matatamis, kapag off nagMe-time coffee shop, lakas ko magwhite rice, wala akong physical activities kaya rin sguro eh lumobo ako.

Paano ko nalaman na T2 diab ako, frequent urination, biglang bagsak ng weight ko kase ang taas na pala ng blood sugar ko way back 2023 and nagka Bacterial Vaginosis ako kaya napilitan akong magpa OB. nagpalab tests and endorsed agad sa Endo. Every quarter po ako may required lab test and currently on 2000mg of Metformin, sitagliptin, and dapagliflozin dahil nag 200+ mg/dl na ako after kumain.

Things I've done para tulungan sarili ko before Tirzep-

\*Nagdance class ako last year. Sa Tads Cubao per session nila now is 400. Fun sya kaso nagbago akong sched this year sa work so di na ako nakabalik. Helped me maging active.

\*Nagbrown rice kaso kapag nagccheck ako ng Continuous glucose monitor ko or nagpprick ang taas pa rin tlga nya after meal.

\*Netong last May alarming na talaga since nagCGM na ako kitang kita ko talaga ung pagspike tapos sobrang tagal bumaba. I'll attach photos din dito sa post para kita ung taas and gaano katagal syang mataas.

\*Nagemergency consultation ako sa Endocrinologist ko dahil natatakot na kami ng husband ko, nag 230+ ako at kahit ntulog na ako di pa rin sya bumaba. May shared app kse ung OTTAI - cgm ko nakikita nya ung blood sugar ko and nagaalarm kpag lagpas 180 sya.

\*Nagtry ako this May umorder ng food prepped meals kaso di ko naman nauubos ang ending ay ang mister ko ang kumakain

\*Nagtry akong magjuice ng greens - malunggay, cucumber, ampalaya, lahat ng gulay na green hahahahha nakatulong sya kaso ang trabaho gawin.

\*Nag-add ako ng egg sa diet ko at yogurt pero feeling ko un ung nakpagpataas ng blood sugar ko pa.

\*Nagtry na rin ako ng slimming coffees pero mas nakakasama to sa health in the long run kse appetite suppresant tlga.

\*Nagwwalk ako 2x a week kapag off ko around dito lang sa amin.

\*Nag-iwas na ako sa sugary drinks. Wala na akong coffee talaga at di na ako dependent sa kape kpag may work. Ang drink ko na lang eh Matcha sa SB hot.

\*Nag no rice meal kami rin ni mister, minsan tinapay lang at salad yan. Fave ko rin kasi ang salad.

Wala na talaga akong pag-asa last May and June at parang one of my darkest periods sya ng buhay ko kse nakakafrustrate na lahat ginagawa ko pero walang effect tlaga sa blood sugar ko and weight.

Inaral kong mabuti ung Tirzep -medically approved and safe sya lalo na sa may problem sa Insulin (diab and may pcos).

Ang tagal bago ako nagdecide pero eventually, umorder na rin ako.

Updates:

* lost 3kgs in a month. Di ko habol na sobrang biglang baba agad. I've read and seen testimonials na napasama pa sa kanila ang drastic na weight loss dahil nadale cholesterol nila at gallbladder.

# please wag mag increase ng dosage agad agad at wag masyadong focus sa weight loss na hindi naman din healthy and diet.

* MENTALLY HELPED ME A LOT. Ung paiyak iyak ko lagi at overthink ko. Mas umaliwalas thinking ko. Proven din na Tirzep helped me sa depression ko (undiagnosed) may high functioning depression ako and sobrang nega ko sa work. helped me na magisip logically and di na kung ano anong naiisip. (Late ko na to napansin tapos I tried researching and totoo nga na it helps sa well being)
* waaaaa ung panlasa ko nagbago. I cooked pasta for the fam, sabi nila ang sarap daw pero nung tinikman ko na ung akin parang ang alat at di ko sya naubos. Ilang beses na to nangyare na nagluto ako at inayawan ko pero sabi ng mister ko masarap naman daw.
* supressed tlaga appetite mo PERO KUMAIN KA PA RIN. kumakain pa rin ako at nagttrack kelan last meal ko kasi di rin pwedeng di ako naggutom di ako kakain. Kahit small portions lang.

‚úì‚úì‚úì I added C-lium fiber na capsules sa everyday ko 5 kada morning, minsan night pero need mo ng maraming tubig kapag nagadd ka ng fiber sa diet dahil if hindi magiging constipated ka and ang poops ay matigas.

‚úì‚úì‚úì Nagadd ako ng whey protein, eto sobrang importante neto habang naka Tirzep ka. Bought myself Athlene and Wheyl, may kamahal pero nalaman kong grabe ung grams na need ko per day sa weight ko.

Computation: weight in kgs \* 0.8 80 \* 0.8 = 64 grams of protein need ko itake daily and I can say this helped me a lot. Wala akong side effects maliban sa mas nging sleepyhead ako.

‚úì‚úì‚úì Electrolytes - add this also lalo na sa mga nagsusuka and nahihilo. Ako inadd ko lang din kse pag diabetic ka panay inom ng tubig and need ko talaga neto.

Two cents:

* wag gamiting mabilisang weight loss ang Tirzep or any peptide. Again, you can check negative effects ng biglang bagsak ng weight baka imbis na sumaya eh maospital pa.
* pakiramdaman ang sarili. May mga support group for sure ang mga sources or sellers so better reach out to them or if nirefer ka, hopefully eh matulungan ka ng nagrefer.
* make sure na nakpagpacheck up at may laboratory din kayo para nattrack nyong healthy kayo.
* ang result eh depende how your body responds to the peptide. may mga days bago makaramdam ng fullness agad may mga tao naman na 1st night pa lang nagssuka na. Depende sa diet pa rin yan.

As of today (August), okay ung laboratory ko and sobrang saya ko dahil ngayon lang umokay tlga ung lab results ko. Binabaan na rin ng Endo ko ung dosage ko ng metformin from 2grams to 1gram na lang and binawasan ng Sitagliptin.

I am just so happy of my Tirzep journey pero ang goal ko lang makareach ang goal weight na 65kgs

Starting weight 82kgs  
Current weight 74kgs

Goal weight 65 kgs

If you'll see the post history/comment history/active communities of most redditors here who keep crying about meetups and the people who comment on these posts; even a guy will avoid a meetup with such creeps. I'm not saying all of them are creep but think about it. 

Often I find it's lonely men who keep yapping about meetups meetups meetups. .

Most fuxkers see photos of men and women meeting in other subreddits and they think it's a good way to get even that decimal of female interaction and shoot their shot. 

Even in other subs, it's rarey an open public meetup but people who knows each other over constant interactions over time in reddit. They meet. They plan and they invite their friends. There's responsibility attached to it. Safety is ensured since almost everyone is known in one way out other.

Feel free to ignore this or not. I needed somewhere to vent about my year of discovering and dealing with panic attacks to people who get it. I have some people I could talk to about it but I have a feeling god would be brought up and honestly I don‚Äôt want to hear about gods plan for me if it involves dealing with this lmao.

I never dealt with serious panic attacks until last year. Last August I had covid bad. I was laid up in my house for days, going through a break up, trying to survive. I decided to pick up some theraflu and mucinex dm to help get over my sickness. All was going well until I started getting short of breath, my heart was steadily beating faster, and I could feel my hands and feet getting colder. I got scared and called my sister. She told me I was having a panic attack, and to grab an ice pack and hold it in my hands to distract my brain. It helped a little, and we eventually got off the phone. After about 15 minutes things went downhill fast. Never in my life had I been so certain I was going to die, and it was in the top three scariest moments of my life. I was in child‚Äôs pose on the floor just trying to breath, tracking my pulse with my watch when I decided to call 911 because I was certain I was gonna pass out and die. I even called my soon to be ex boyfriend to get him to the house just in case. Of course, everything turned out fine and I apologized so profusely to the EMT team that came out. From there, I stopped taking anything with Dextromethorphin(DM). 

Things were okay ish for a while, until I was in Savannah this spring for work. There was a lot of drinking, a lot of hangovers, and a lot of caffeine. Almost every morning I would walk to a local coffee shop and get a cold brew and a sandwich. I love coffee, I‚Äôve drank it almost daily since I was 17. I had 2 bad panic attacks over the course of 4 weeks. It seemed like it was triggered by coffee so I stopped. 

When I got home, I wasn‚Äôt drinking coffee, I started taking magnesium, my alcohol consumption dropped to 4 drinks a week, my boyfriend and I are back together, and I started exercising more. I started getting episodes at night, heart racing, jolted awake, etc. Fine, I said, I‚Äôll change my night routine, prioritize relaxation. Now I take my magnesium, drink warm uncaffeinated tea, and listen to an asmr video to fall asleep. The episodes don‚Äôt happen as often, even though I‚Äôve had 2 panic attacks in 4 weeks again. Last nights wasn‚Äôt bad in severity of feeling, just that it kept me up almost all night, and nothing could crack it. 

I‚Äôm kinda at the end of my rope and am looking at supplements. I can‚Äôt really deal with meds right now as they interfere with my job, and frankly that added stress is not one I‚Äôm looking for. My routine has been stable for a few months now and it was working. The only thing that is changing is that my boyfriend and I are breaking up again (this time initiated by me), which is clearly putting me under more stress. He likes to joke that maybe my body is telling me we shouldn‚Äôt (I‚Äôd like to tell him that maybe my body is telling me he‚Äôs too much to deal with but I‚Äôm trying to be nice lol). 

Frankly, I‚Äôm getting tired of feeling so weak and not being able to enjoy a hot cup of coffee when I wake up. Why should my broken brain get to control my life this much??

So, I‚Äôm looking for an espresso machine. I‚Äôm a total beginner but am sick of buying $7 lattes and would love to make my own at home. I do not want the actual pod to brew the whole cup, but more so just brew the espresso and I froth my milk etc in a separate frother.

I‚Äôve checked Nespresso, had a Keurig in the past, and I also checked a few others but I‚Äôve heard very mixed reviews on all of them and I‚Äôm torn. I‚Äôve researched this to the point where I have no idea what to choose.

Keurig I‚Äôve had before for the coffee pods themselves - never tried their other products.

Nespresso seems great and all but there isn‚Äôt a lot of pod options for a light espresso and it‚Äôs pretty pricey for the pods.

What‚Äôs your recommendation?

This is just good old-fashioned comedy that is way funnier than it should be and over-the-top just the right amount.

The aptly named Neeson plays Frank Drebin Jr., the son of Leslie Nielsen‚Äôs Frank Drebin from the earlier flicks. He plays the role perfectly, almost as if Nielsen himself was channeled through him at times. Right from the start, the gags come at you left and right (just like the coffee cups), but not so much that you lose sight of the plot. Having most of the cast playing straight man to Neeson‚Äôs tomfoolery works well at the beginning, then having Anderson‚Äôs Beth Davenport join in the madness turns it up a notch.

It had lots of nods to the original films, but they didn‚Äôt play them scene by scene. Instead, they appeared to be carefully thought out and executed in a funny way. The best one was the love montage between Frank, Beth, and something else I don't want to give away. It was brilliant, and I read in an interview that Akiva came up with it on a whim and they barely changed a single scene of it. But it did a good job of reminding me of the love montage between Nielsen and Priscilla Presley.

It wasn‚Äôt all roses and daisies, though. Some scenes ran on too long, and a couple fell somewhat flat. It‚Äôs odd to say that a movie that has a runtime of 85 minutes had parts that went too long, but a few of the jokes were drawn out for what seems to be no reason at all.

Overall, ‚ÄúThe Naked Gun‚Äù was a refreshing change and a fun way to laugh for an hour and a half. It‚Äôs delightful to laugh in a full theater full of others who are also laughing. It was very funny and had nods to the old ones. I hope they can use the same characters, writers, and directors, and can make a couple more of these. The fun time I had and some great gags earn this a 7 out of 10.

1mvvvt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1mvvvt9/planning_my_sisters_baby_shower_may_have_ruined/,Planning my sister's baby shower may have ruined my relationship with my mom,"Bear with me, this is a big tangled mess and I feel like the details matter. I (28f) have been at odds with my parents (60s m&f) for the past few years ever since I came out as a lesbian. 

A little background: I was raised really religious and got married to my ex-husband at the age of 22. Almost immediately, I realized something was very wrong with my marriage and I spent three years trying (in the midst of the pandemic) to figure out how to make it work. Well, eventually I realized I was a lesbian and I could not make it work in a way that was the most loving to either of us, so my ex and I divorced. It was amicable enough, but certainly not easy. (It never is.) 

I lived with my parents immediately after to get back on my feet and finally came out to them about a month before I was set to move out of their house and in with some friends in a new city. They didn't yell and scream and disown me, but they made it clear they don't support ""what I'm doing"" and had a bunch of Bible Verses to back it all up. 

Cut to about three years later. I've been in a relationship with my girlfriend (27f) for two years and we are planning to move in together soon. I've been open with my parents about her all along the way. I told them about her after we'd been together about four months and I knew it was something serious. That was a bad fight that ended in tears and a three month ice out where we didn't speak. 

Whenever we've spoken on the phone or in-person since then, they've avoided the topic. Only ever talking about themselves or my siblings or asking about my job or my roommates. Never my girlfriend. Even when I tell stories of things I've done (camping trips, weddings, beach days, making new friends) with her, they just change the subject and ignore it entirely. I try to be respectful and not name drop her all the time, but most of the things I'm doing are with her, so it's kind of hard to avoid. (When I say ""we went to Mexico"" they know who I mean.) We had another pretty big fight this last Christmas. I tried to express to my mom how hurtful it is that they completely ignore this huge part of my life, and she came back with ""it's hurtful that you're shoving it in our faces."" I feel like we have two very different perceptions of reality. 

I took my girlfriend my hometown earlier this summer and asked my parents (months in advance of our trip) if they'd consider meeting us for a coffee so I could introduce her to them. After ignoring my question for two months, I finally got an answer out of them: a resounding and devastating no. 

We've had periods of awkward attempts to play nice in between periods of ice since then, but the most recent development has been my sister's baby shower. My sister (31f) is due with her first child in the next month or so. Her baby's father was a relatively new boyfriend when they got pregnant, but they seem happy together and excited about the baby. Knowing what you do about my parents, you can imagine that they didn't react great. They're trying, though, to get to know the baby daddy and help my sister out as much as possible with the pregnancy. We're all excited about the baby, but also nervous because it was very unexpected. 

My sister lives in a big city and my parents live in a small town about four hours from my sister. My mom wanted to throw her a baby shower in our home town for all the relatives, and my sister also really wanted a shower in her city for all her friends. I told her I could help her plan the city one, I thought it would take pressure off of her and I was excited to get to help plan a baby shower for my sister. When we talked to my mom about the plans, she freaked out because I was planning to fly in the morning of the shower (9:00 am) and set everything up for the 3:00 pm party. She thought I wouldn't have enough time and would stress my heavily-pregnant sister out. I told her I had it handled, but she insisted that she would come the day before and help set things up and bring her own decorations etc. I put my foot down. I told her not to stress about it and to worry about her own shower the weekend before. 

I talked to my girlfriend about it and she said she could come help me. So I asked my sister (who had met my girlfriend earlier in the year and really liked a her) and she said of course, she'd love for her to come. Problem solved, right? 

Well, because I knew my mom wasn't comfortable meeting my girlfriend when we visited my hometown, I wanted to let her know that gf would come to help me so she didn't feel blindsided if she showed up and gf was there. That wouldn't be fair to my mom and it really wouldn't be fair to my girlfriend. 

I called my mom, told her I thought about what she said and I probably did need help so gf was coming to help me. She said ""thanks for letting me know"" and hung up.

We had my sisters shower last month and my gf and I had a fun time in my sister's city and loved getting to hang out with her. My mom didn't come. I haven't heard from her since that phone call. 

Now that the baby is due any day now, I'm getting really anxious. Should I be the one to break the silence (yet again) to try to smooth things over before baby is born? Should I wait and see if my parents reach out to me? (They are with my sister right now in prep for the due date.) I feel like I've been trying to do right by everyone and just fucked everything up. My parents aren't talking to me, my sister is having to be an intermediary while she should only have to be focusing on having a healthy pregnancy, and my girlfriend is being disrespected by my parents and getting a really depressed and anxious version of me while I try to figure out how to hold my grasp on my family and my relationship. Honestly, if it wasn't for the baby, I would probably just accept that I need an extended period of no-contact with my parents. But I want us to be able to be civil with the little one coming into the world. I also don't want my girlfriend to think it's her fault that my relationship with my parents has fractured. I'm so worried about her realizing my family is too messy and walking away. I'm usually the peace maker in my family, I hate being the one to cause strife, but I know what I deserve and I want to prioritize what is best for my relationship. I want to marry this woman, but I also don't want to lose my parents. Any advice or words of encouragement or just screaming i to the void with me, would be appreciated! Or honestly, if I'm at all the asshole here, I want to know that too! Help!!!

Very very limited experience. I never even felt comfortable entertaining the possibility of satisfying someone else's sexual desires just so I could be in a relationship. Asexuality is truly a spectrum and I fall into the much more physical touchy and sensual attraction territory. I've honestly met like maybe 2 other out Ace people and so frankly I just kind of felt that it was highly likely that I would not find someone for a very long time or at all... and even if I met another Ace person.. would we even be compatible? I thought maybe I'd have a better chance finding someone non-Ace with just a very low libido like I've seen in this sub. They seem content and happy.

Anyway. I opened Hinge one night, wondering why I even had that darn app installed, when I saw someone liked my profile. I am not immediately attracted to looks alone in general, but I thought her profile was charming so I gave it a shot and long story short she asked me out to coffee right away and it turns out she was questioning being Ace as well. Come to find out we're the exact same type of asexual and I feel like I hit the lottery.

We communicate very well and very sincerely enjoy our time together on all our dates.

That being said, I really really truly don't want to fuck this up. It's scary all of a sudden being aware of all the possibilities you can fail someone. I did not have the best example of a healthy relationship from my parents; I only know what **not** to do, not what ***to do***.

I‚Äôve tried Ben and Jerry‚Äôs Dublin mudslide (it‚Äôs very good) but it‚Äôs only at Wegmans near me and it‚Äôs not always easy for me to get and I work at Kroger and I‚Äôve tried our Kroger brand cookies n cream latte. It‚Äôs solid but nothing touches publix‚Äôs cookies n cream cold brew. Do you know any other coffee cookies n cream ice creams. I live in the Midlothian, Virginia area (eastern Virginia). I‚Äôll even take any coffee flavors with mix ins in it (I love Ben and Jerry‚Äôs coffee buzz buzz buzz and days Mocha almond fudge and Perry‚Äôs bittersweet simthony and Wegmans cappuccino chip)",1,1755734455.0,icecream,1,1.0,False

To catch everyone up, I have been a heavy drinker for about 8 or 9 years, caught 2 DUIs over the years, the second of which I still have a year of probation to go. None of the often serious consequences of my drinking has been enough to make me face the severity of my addiction until now. At the end of July and beginning of August I moved in with my partner of a year and a half. I love her very much and I had started thinking of her 2 children as my own. I knew she had boundaries about drinking as her ex husband is an alcoholic and she had even told me when we came back from vacation in June that my behavior on that trip was not going to fly. Still I persisted and had deluded myself into thinking I had cut back and was drinking in moderation. Now I know there is no moderation. I work late nights as a manager of a bar and Saturday morning I got home from work around 4:30am. She's an early riser and got up to make coffee. I tried to kiss her on the cheek and she didn't react. I asked to talk about her recent distance and coldness and that's when the bomb dropped and the foundations crumbled around my life. You have a serious problem. I was hoping it would get better, but it hasn't. I don't think there's anything you can do to make me feel the way I did about you. I was hurt and shocked, but packed up my thinks and went to stay with my parents' down the road without argument, where I've been since.

That night I got very drunk and was angry, depressed, probably suicidal if I'm honest and somehow through the stupor, I was struck with clarity: the only path forward was sobriety. I don't know if there is a way to repair my relationship. I do want it, but I decided to get sober so alcohol can't take another thing from me, not to placate a woman that may not want to try again. I am not doing it for her, but I am doing it because of her. I have not had a drink since Saturday night, I've been posting here and reading others' experiences, I'm working on scheduling a consultation with a substance abuse counselor, and I've been tracking my sobriety with the I Am Sober app.

Today is 4 days deep and I have no plans to relapse and I feel more like myself than I have in a long time, even with the pain I'm going through. 

The anger I felt has been replaced with responsibility for my own actions and behind the darkness of this time I do see the light of a bright future forming in the cracks.

1mvvjir,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDigitalCircus/comments/1mvvjir/jax_is_right/,Jax is right.,"At least, about some things.

Alright, something's been bugging me ever since Episode 5, and I think I've finally started to put it together. It started when Pomni and Zooble shared that they both explored abandoned buildings in the real world. ""Oh,"" I thought, ""That explains how they got here. They explored the abandoned C&A building, found the headsets, then put them on."" Except, no one else says they do things like that. Urban exploration is a very niche hobby; if it turned out that all six of them did that IRL, you'd think it'd have come up here. Ragatha, at the very least, would have latched onto a shared interest with Pomni with both jaws, given how desperate she was to pull her away from Jax, but it slides by without comment.

So, how did the rest of them get there? Well, Kinger claims to have experience in computer science, and C&A clearly has some advanced computer programs running. Maybe he used to work there.   
  
THAT is where it hit me. The Circus is still running. It has to be, which you would assume would tip some government official off. An abandoned property is siphoning enough power to run advanced AI and a full-immersion simulation? That doesn't make sense either, except we know that C&A is NOT abandoned.

In the pilot, the very last thing we see is the Real World, and the desk the Circus is running on. It looks tidy, well-maintained, cleaner than even the virtual equivalent in the exit hall. Various equipment is plugged into the wall next to it, placed to be used later. We see a picture of it in Episode 6, where we get a view of what looks like a lobby. The walls are clean, the lights are on, and there's even a coffee on the desk.

Now we have two conflicting implications. Pomni and Zooble's hobby implies that they were exploring the abandoned building and got sucked in, while all of our views of the building give no indication that it's abandoned. These things conflict because the urban exploration isn't real. It's a backstory to give them a plausible explanation for being in the Circus, just like Kinger's background gives him a plausible explanation for being there.

The ""players"" are just AI, even more advanced than Caine, created and thrown into the Circus as an ethical trial run before human testing is attempted. That's why Zooble and Pomni's stories don't line up with what little we've seen of reality. That's why Episode 2 devoted its entire run time to exploring an NPC (who Caine confirms has been GIVEN NEW AI TO MAKE HIM SEEM MORE LIFELIKE) discovering the truth. That's why their models aren't below the map: That's below the Candy Kingdom map, THEIR models are below the Circus map. That's why Caine CAN affect their minds with Stupid Sauce and the vote system. That's why the mannequin rooms exist and abstracted players' rooms aren't cleared out: The developers already know how many AIs they're going to run through the Circus on this test, they don't need any more. That's why Kinger went insane, but didn't abstract: He's insane the way a HUMAN would go insane, losing his ability to reason. The abstracted are insane in the way an AI goes insane, losing their ability to maintain cohesive forms because their code is glitching. That's why Pomni appeared right when Kaufmo abstracted - she was deliberately inserted by the devs to keep a stable population. That's why, on the surface, they have NOTHING in common, because they're a focus group testing for the largest possible audience!

Jax is right: They are just cartoon characters, but they weren't designed to stop there. They were made to be true-blue human-equivalent AI, capable of all the same creative and lateral thinking we are, becoming more and more complex and experienced with each adventure, because the devs are using them to create the greatest game ever that can give ANY player the best possible version of any experience they can think of.",2,1755734163.0,TheDigitalCircus,0,1.0,False

Reina: She's my main so obviously I like her the most. Out of the three, she seems like the most popular one and most likely to be in Tekken 9. She fit in well with the cast and her gameplay is quite unique compared to the other Mishimas. Safe to say that majority of the community prefer her over the others

Azucena: I think people calling her an ""one dimensional"" character whose personality is ""coffee"" are tripping. She is much much more than that. I dont want to write a long rant since she is not even my main, but I really disagree with the criticism she gets for a newcomer. She is a shrewd business woman that will do anything to get what she wants which includes entering a martial arts tournament, joining Kazuya's evil side and also having a mini partnership with Leroy and Lili in hopes of expanding her brand. Also she's a natural entertainer and knows how to get into her opponent's head with her dance moves. To me, it feels like haters expect her to be some edgy character with a tragic backstory but thats not her. Anyway enough rambling, but Azucena is fine as she is. I know that the community hate ""waifu"" characters, but I for one dont mind them at all

Victor: Okay this is my most controversial, Victor belongs in Tekken. Spare me the ""weapon based characters dont belong in Tekken"" take. We have devils that can shoot lasers from their eyes and can fly, an anime robot girl with chainsaws(yes I know that she's hated too), a sword wielding fool that does wacky shenanigans and literal animals. Im sorry, but Victor to me is not taking things too far and personally I feel like most of the hate stems from him not being a legacy character. In alot of ways, he's like the Kunimitsus and their BS mixed with Yoshimitsu.  I will say that Victor is overdesigned and perhaps overtuned as well. However I disagree heavily on him not belonging in Tekken.  Oh and the particle effects are indeed annoying to fight against. I agree with that

TLDR: All three characters are nice addition to the franchise. Reina is my main and easily my fave Mishima. I dont understand the Azucena hate and the whole ""she only has one personality which is coffee"" take. Oh and Victor does indeed belong in Tekken

Crystal and Lori stated they saw Amy and Yellow enter the elevator and go up to the ""disco"" (AKA the Viking Lounge), located on the 11th deck. About 15 minutes later, they saw him return, without Amy, alone. Amy was never seen leaving the Viking Lounge. Another witness, Elizabeth, who was in the Viking Lounge early that morning, corroborated the testimony given by Lori and Crystal. Elizabeth stated she watched Amy and Yellow get off the glass elevator and enter the Viking Lounge. She saw Yellow give Amy a drink that contained a dark liquid. It could have been Coke or coffee.

Elizabeth left the Viking lounge shortly after, as she had a shore excursion booked for Curacao. She left the disco and waited to disembark the ship.

It has been reported there was a service/freight elevator located on the 11th deck that connects the upper deck to the cargo hold. Could this possibly explain why Amy was never seen leaving the Viking Lounge/Disco area? ",7,1755733735.0,AmyLynnBradley,9,0.74,False

Remember Me by Jovoy- at first spray, I thought the vanilla in it was similar to Eau Duelle, but the spices are so different. Less incense more milky chai. I think it might be my new favorite perfume. There‚Äôs something so intoxicating and cozy about it.

Blue Madeleine by Atelier Des Ors- another tea scent. I love it so much. Less milky and spicy, more fresh and citrusy. It reminds me of when I was a kid and would go in my mom‚Äôs garden and pick herbs and fruits to go in my black tea. 

Blanche B√™te by Liquides Imaginaires- I wasn‚Äôt sure how I‚Äôd like this one because I‚Äôm not typically a floral person, but it‚Äôs so interesting I couldn‚Äôt put it down! I would describe this one as being in the middle of a meadow in your dreams. It feels soft, feminine, and ethereal. 

Yesterday Haze by Imagjnary Authors- this probably sounds so strange, but it gives hollister a little bit (in the best way). I really love it. Idk it really gives cool older sister vibes to me and it‚Äôs so different from the other perfumes I have. 

Seoul by One Day- okay at first spray this is a little pungent from the coffee/cocoa, but the dry down is divine to me. Definitely sticks close to the skin and isn‚Äôt a huge projecting smell, but I really enjoy it! The only way I can describe it is you‚Äôre eating tiramisu in your cashmere sweater at a fancy ski resort.

ith Karen popping up in many stores the SMG4 Crew visits ever wonder how many jobs she exactly has? I got this idea from watching SMG4 Meme Mayhem where it's implied she Manger of Book Store being step above Karen Prime in regular SMG4 videos 

We know she works at Coffee store as her Prime job but we also see her work in restaurants and tech stores like in episode about SMG4 birthday we also know her for employer tires to hire her for occasional job or two which she regularly refuses a majority of the time 

Oh and fight attendant I almost forgot about that one 

She probably works in other places across SMG4 version of the Mushroom Kingdom we still do know like I wouldn't be surprised seeing seeing her working in casino, sub Nurse  and maybe other jobs that are simple enough yet take hours having three kids and all that 

Makes you wonder who takes care of the 3 of them when she at work in maybe tells SMG4 Crew to keep an eye on them? I mean since there her friends there basically free babysitters imagine Tari as babysitter given her powers the kids can literally go into Minecraft 

I bet Karen is looking for that one job that gives her enough were she doesn't need all those other ones

Like many in medicine, my days are long, unpredictable, and emotionally heavy. My ‚Äústress management‚Äù toolkit was simple: exercise when I could, coffee when I couldn‚Äôt. It worked until it didn‚Äôt.

Lately, I was running on fumes. Constant fatigue. Irritation over small things. That quiet, heavy feeling that you‚Äôre not sure you can shake.

Then, in the middle of a rough week, a nurse I work with told me about a breathing practice she swore had changed her life. I decided to look into myself. 

The deciding factor for me was a randomized controlled trial published in Frontiers in Psychiatry. They compared Sudarshan Kriya (SKY) Breath Meditation to other well-being practices. Eight weeks of SKY led to measurable improvements in depression, stress, positive emotions, mindfulness, and even social connectedness. Harvard and Stanford studies backed it up too.

Fine. Science brain satisfied. I gave it a shot.

And here‚Äôs what surprised me: within weeks‚Ä¶
	‚Ä¢	I had more energy through long shifts without my third coffee.
	‚Ä¢	I was calmer during tough calls, even emergencies.
	‚Ä¢	My sleep improved so much it felt like a superpower.
	‚Ä¢	I had more patience with my staff and myself.

Nine months in, I can say it‚Äôs not hype. The daily practice clears my head, boosts my mood, and somehow helps me feel more connected to the people around me. Even my nurses noticed I‚Äôm less snappy and more approachable (their words, not mine).

It‚Äôs rare in medicine to find something where the science and your lived experience line up so perfectly. SKY isn‚Äôt a magic wand but it‚Äôs the most sustainable tool I‚Äôve found to take care of me, so I can keep taking care of others.

They also criticized that the posts included the age of the person in the phone call, which is absurd. How did the Tea app get approved if that was the case?

Finally, notice how they mentioned the Coffee app allows you to indicate if someone is a criminal or not, for safety reasons, such as false accusation, fraud, defamation, etc. Apple deemed that this is against the ToS, yet the Tea app has full features to have women identify and accuse men of being criminals.

One of the biggest reasons for the trip is to try some of the amazing breweries you have in the City / just outside but I want to make sure we haven‚Äôt missed any amazing ones! We have Treehouse on the list (tried some beers over here and their NEIPAs are just different level to every else I‚Äôve tried!)

Thinking either of bars who stock smaller breweries who‚Äôs brilliant or just the more lesser known ones around? 

To explore as much as we can, we‚Äôre looking at getting the 7 day travel pass for $22.50. I just wanted to check if this is recommended? We are there for 4 full days and will be not far from the Red line / JFK stop. 

For some other recommendations in general, especially when it comes to vegetarian food & coffee, is there anywhere that is a really big must!? Similar to the breweries and bars, keen to look at something slightly less known but equally as good of them places such exist! 

And lastly‚Ä¶going back to Logan airport for a 8pm flight. We don‚Äôt have checked in luggage and only hand / carry on luggage, is getting there two hours before okay or would it be recommended to get there for the full 3 hours before?

1mvv1ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1mvv1ha/neodrius_cyberpunk_noir_chapter_7_first_trial/,Neodrius (Cyberpunk Noir) - Chapter 7 - First Trial,"Viktor woke up with a smile on his face. He'd not felt this good since... well, ever, he realized. Sure, he grumbled about the endless hours in the lab. And working with the Nanoforge was not easy. The bucket of bolts had more functions than Victor had fingers. But he liked it nonetheless, his heart fulfilled. The smell of the air, or lack of it, still disturbed him, as did the flavorless water. They had it backwards 'round here. But fuck it if he was gonna complain.

He didn't tell Miss Nataly about the side effects of Spike. He wanted to, at least he told himself that. But he remembered Martin interrupting that, and Miss Nataly never asked again, so maybe it was okay? Viktor sure hoped so, because he didn't want to spoil their fun. Spike whispered to him then, telling him he should release it to his veins. How much sweeter would this morning be if he could feel that ecstasy? But no, Viktor decided. No wasting. He opened the drawer in his desk, just to check if the last two vials were still stored there. One was already in his implant, of course. He liked Martin and feared miss Nataly more than death, but he didn't trust either. And he trusted the others of the Deck even less. Maybe he'd lend a vial to Miss Eva, though. *No, no, no*, he chided himself, and banished the thought. Had to treasure them, at least till they made more.

He cracked his fingers and started dressing himself. Martin should be waiting for him in the dining hall. Well, if he didn't oversleep again, like the tech-junkie used to. He was working on something, apparently, but never bothered to explain what exactly to Viktor. He wasn't gonna pry, not his style. But miss Nataly kept eyeing him, suspiscously, like he ate her dinner and she had yet to find proof. Well, he'd let them sort that out themselves; wasn't his problem.

The last two days had left him needing more sleep, too, though. He recalled the first day, the Nanites eyeing him suspiciously. They looked at him the way middle city folk looked at lower city beggars. He didn't mind, though. Was used to it. And boy, did Viktor **love b**eing in charge of them. He worked alone in the Thomas' gang, so this was like getting a new machine as a present. A machine he just ordered something to, and boom. They made it. Viktor had to tell them how to make Spike several times over, but they had it now. Old idiots, complaining about him 'talking fast and gibberish'. Had to slow down for 'em, and Viktor didn't like that.

Miss Eva said something about implanting the machine part of Spike today, and Viktor hoped he could watch. Not particularly because he wanted to see some guys getting their heads drilled in. Viktor just hoped he could talk to Miss Eva more. His heart warmed at the thought of her. Miss Nataly told him to 'get a fucking clue', but she couldn't command his heart. He'd see her today and finally make his move. Viktor nodded to himself. Yes, today or never. And then they would go test Spike on someone else than him. Hopefully, whatever guy used it would be smart enough not to listen to it.. He didn't particularly like to remember what happened to the people who did.

\--------------------------------

Nataly sat at a bench in the dining hall, looking at Martin and Viktor chatting. Whatever Viktor said must have been funny, because Martin's laughter rolled over the hall like an avalanche. They got along, although she could still see Viktor shuffling whenever either of them got close to him, him constantly twitching his fingers. She hoped hepd get over it. There was no space for nervousness or hesitation, not with everything at stake. Martin finished laughing, but his smile stayed on his face. She wasn't fooled, though. His energetic demeanor didn't hide the circles under his eyes, nor the burns on his hands. His smile didn't quite reach his eyes either. Nataly looked at the elevator again. Still a big line. She felt like smoking, but it looked like it would have to wait until later. Annoyed, she clicked her tongue and sipped her coffee. So bitter. Why did milk have to be so expensive?

Two days ago, Martin left before they entered Eva's office, and he's been holed up in there ever since. She didn't like him keeping secrets from her. But he said he'd tell her eventually. She'd beat it out of him soon if he didn't, that much he could be sure of.

A cleaning lady was mopping the floor. Viktor stood up, not noticing her presence, and he knocked her bucket over, spilling water everywhere. Her gaze went to the floor, and then fiercely went to Viktor.

''Yeeaaah, that's Miss Monica.'' Martin nodded towards the cleaning lady. Her blonde hair was kept short, she was a bit round, and she was maybe more than a head shorter than Nataly. ''Good luck pissing off the only person scarier than Nataly, Vik.''

Nataly got her legs under her and headed straight to Eva's office. Even she felt pity for Viktor in that situation.

\----------------------------

Another few hours passed. Eva was busy implanting the machine into the heads of three of the volunteers, and Nataly didn't want to interrupt, so she just kept quiet and watched her work. She was filled with both excitement and dread. The tests could start today, and that moved them one step closer to stopping the Ristards. But then it'd be her turn. She shivered at the thought of a drill entering her head.

Martin strolled into the room, and Nataly noticed him stumbling over even floor. That man was a wreck. And in his hand was what must have been his third cup of coffee already. She felt herself fume with rage, and it took a lot of self-control to suppress it. He'd tell her what he was doing in that lab of his, or she'd barge in there herself.

''Hey, Martin. Are you really okay? You should get some sleep. Please.'' She touched his shoulder, just to let him know she was there.

His eyes shifted from Viktor to her, and he gave her a wan smile. ''Yes, I'm fine. Just been a rough few days.''

She stared him down.

''Yes, I'll sleep, right after this.'' Another thin smile.

''Promise?''

''Promise. Anyways, are we ready to begin testing?'' She noticed him shifting nervously, looking at something in his glasses.

She nodded. Then she looked at Viktor, who in turn gave her a nervous look. Why was he sweating so much? The first test subject was standing at the ready, and she could only hope that Viktor programmed the nanobots correctly. They didn't have much room for failure. ''Let's begin testing. Nate, inject the drug. Small amounts, like discussed!''

The gang member nodded, came forward, and his irises widened. He smiled and then started jogging around the room. He was twice as fast as an athlete that was sprinting, and he was only getting faster. She smiled. It seemed like Viktor had potential after all. She looked at him with a smile. And in his face she found an expression of terror. He met her eyes, broke out of a stupor, and started shouting.

''Hey, lad, turn it off. Ya getting into dangerous waters, I tell ya. Shut it off now!''

But the soldier only laughed. ''I can go faster!'' He sped up.

''It feels amazing!'' Faster again.

''Stop, you dumb fuck!'' She heard Viktor shout, his voice tense, his tone rising more with each word.

''We can definitely take the inner city on!'' Nataly had trouble following him now, his form blurring as he ran.

''You have no idea how good this feels!'' And then, somehow, he got even faster. He started running laps around the lab at inhuman speeds so fast that Nataly couldn't see his face anymore. He ignored Viktor's pleas to cease using Spike, ignored his attempts to physically stop him.

And then, he dropped in the middle of the room, sprawling on the ground, his eyes white like porcelain. He still had that smile on his face. Foam started forming in his mouth, followed by gurgling sounds, and then by complete silence. Nataly looked at Viktor, his eyes wide with shock, his chest rising and falling in a panicked rhythm. He met her gaze.

And then he ran towards the doors.",2,1755732847.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

She groggily looked at her phone and tapped the alarm button to shut it off. Another nightmare. Those were becoming ever more common these days, and the stress she was going through was likely not helping. She could still imagine the screams. It was 8:15 a.m. She broke out of her sleepy stupor, shook her head, and began preparing for today. It should be a calm day. Did they even have time for a calm day like this? She guessed the nano-drug Viktor developed could be an immense help in battling the inner city, but would they be able to produce enough by the time the unknown timer would be done? There were a lot of them in the Deck, but was that enough to take the fight to the inner city? She'd have to discuss it with Damian later. She started applying her makeup, drawing circles around her eyes with her eyeliner, and after she was finished, she got dressed. The fact that she didn't have to wear as much clothes because of the fact that half of her body was made of augments was freeing. Way less overheating in this smelly, always hot, and humid city. Sure, she had to admit that the augmentics had their own disadvantages. They did not feel like her own limbs, not truly, even after all these years. She stretched her fingers and closed them again, just to feel the numb sensation. Martin kept upgrading them, and she was thankful for that, but they kept changing weight. The moment they started feeling like her own, she'd be stripped of them and given new ones. And that made the feeling of being incomplete return. But she didn't mind that much. The terrible, constant feeling of something being amiss was worth the chance of fighting back. Her legs moved at a simple mental command, and she pitied the people who never got to try the strength that the augments provided. Apparently, she was taking the changes in her body exceptionally well, or at least Martin said so. She was grateful for that fact every day. Finally settling her thoughts, she left and headed for the room Viktor was currently in.

As she approached the room, she saw Viktor already standing in front of the door. He was stepping from foot to foot, all nervous energy. But at least he finally kind of fit in, with the new clothes that were not made out of more dirt than... whatever the material on his shirt was. Probably polymer? She noted that he was somehow even earlier than she was. She came 10 minutes early on purpose, but he looked ready to go. It looked like he was not taking her orders lightly. Good. She came even closer, and he finally lifted his gaze, met her eyes, and waved.

''Hello, Miss Nataly. Good morning to you!'' He smiled, and she could see a few of his teeth missing. His rust-colored hair was finally less disgusting, now free of the grime that had plagued it before. He looked five years younger. She would ask Martin later to replace the for him if he did a good job. It unnerved her to see that kind of smile. It reminded her of her childhood. She stopped next to him and instantly noticed that he must have showered, and maybe even used deodorant. Thank God, the difference was out of this world. She could instantly feel herself tolerating him quite a bit more.

''Good morning, Viktor.'' She raised her eyebrow. Miss? Good, looks like he learns fast.

She looked around for Martin, but he was late. Again. She'd reform him into a morning person one day. They'd be lucky if he was on time. ''Let's wait for Martin, and then we'll go to the scanner. We'll see how big that hole in your head is, and then you'll try showing some of our guys how you program the nanobots.'' Breathing out, she continued. ''Should be a calm day.''

''Umm, does the scanner hurt? My side still hurts from yer kicking yesterday.''

''No, it doesn't, don't worry. We're on a tight schedule, so you'd better teach well. Understood?''

Viktor just nodded, so Nataly leaned against a wall and just waited for Martin to arrive. The silence suited her just fine, but Viktor continued shuffling in the doorway of his room. ''What is it, Viktor?'' she asked finally, just to quiet him down.

Viktor started, looked at her, and considered. Good, it looked like there was some kind of thinking going on behind those dead eyes of his still. She didn't think he was stupid, but the way he talked sometimes presented him as a tool.

''Well, ya know, how I said that Spike has some side effects, like shortening ya lifespan?'' When Nataly nodded, he continued. ''That's not the only side effect. It kinda has another one. ''He looked so nervous, maybe struggling to put whatever this was into words? Or was it something else? ''We wanted the others in my gang to use spike as well, but the boys never got used to it like I did. Eh, it's kinda hard to explain, ya know? But it wants you to. How do I say this.''

Nataly raised her eyebrow, listening intently, and Viktor went to continue. But just then, Martin burst into the hallway.

''Hey guys! Sorry that I'm late. Am I late? I honestly have no idea. Was too holed up in research.'' He quickly caught his breath and looked at them both. He sniffed the air as well and looked slightly relieved.

Nataly scanned him. Jesus, did this man even sleep? The bags under his eyes were huge. ''Martin, did you sleep at all? Do you need a coffee before we head towards medical?''

Martin just chuckled, but it sounded a bit forced to Nataly. ''That bad? But yeah, coffee sounds lovely. Coffee, and then we go to the scanner.''

They both slightly smiled, but the silent moment was broken by Viktor's excited half shout. ''Ya got free coffee here?''

The only reply to that was Martin's laugh.

They walked through the halls of the Silver deck's hideout just to reach the coffee machine. The halls were alive with activity, people running to and fro, a few children walking with food in their hands. The food shop was taking food cards and quickly handing people their breakfast. There was a line to the elevators, a few dozen people waiting with e-cigs in their hands. Viktor was gushing about how incredible everything here looked, and would not stop, no matter how many times Nataly told him to shut up. Oh well, he would stop eventually. At least she hoped.

After a while, they finally got their coffee and pathed to the scanner. Martin sipped on his coffee and then headed in a different direction than was planned. ''Hey, let's grab breakfast while we're here. I'm sure Dr. Eva will understand.''

She wanted to protest, but truth be told, she was getting hungry herself. Also, Viktor has been almost salivating ever since they came near the food shop and he smelled some fish and potatoes.

After a short wait, Nataly grabbed her plate from the hands of Gustavo, one of the cooks, and sat down next to Martin. Before she finished her first half of the fish, Viktor's whole plate was almost gone.

''Damn, what do ya put into this? I'm so full. Used'ta try to catch fish in the little lake up north of the outer city, but got nothing. This tastes much better than protein paste.''

Ew. She tried that exactly once. Never again. Before she could express her hatred, Martin interrupted. ''No protein sludge here, Vik. One of the towers produces it, and nobody here trusts anything that they make. You'd better remember that. No Ristard products allowed.''

Viktor didn't finish chewing before bombarding them with his next question. ''So, what's this? just roasted fish?''

''Yeah, more or less. Just fish mixed with flour and baked potatoes, so nothing special. They make it like once or twice a week.''

Viktor nodded and started licking his plate. Nataly used all of her willpower not to sigh for the umpteenth time today. Manners could come later. And just then, Martin smirked at her and started licking the plate in the exact same way.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

The medical exam with the scanner went through quickly. Doctor Eva was as beautiful as ever. Nataly was pretty sure she was attractive herself, at least what remained of her body was. But even though she herself was curvy, Eva was voluptuous. Some men apparently hurt themselves on purpose, just to try to seduce her. As far as she knew, none of them managed to win her favor. Viktor, who was less indecent than Nataly expected of someone from the lower city, was doing his best not to look at her curves, and he was failing miserably. Couldn't really blame the guy, as she was guilty herself. The fact that her kind nature made everyone feel welcome here probably didn't help Eva in getting fewer people to try to get with her.

The hole in Viktor's, or as Martin started calling him, Vik's, head was around the size of a ping-pong ball. She expected it to be way smaller, and Eva noted that Viktor's hole wasn't perfectly circular, most likely due to the crack that was there previously.

She focused on work while he tried chatting up Eva, who was as kind as always. His poor attempts at flirting were irritating her, and so she just completely tuned them out and focused. First, she put up a request for volunteers to test the drug today in their network. Six volunteers registered in a minute. As always, she was thankful for the Decks' loyalty. If all went according to plan, they might even start testing in a few days.

And now, with nothing else to do, she struck up some conversation herself. ''Who drilled the hole, Viktor? The one in your skull? They almost killed you.''

''Drilled it m'self, Miss Nataly. Passed out twice while at it.'' Another toothless smile. She forced the memory linked with a smile like that away. But couldn't. She still recalled today's nightmare, the memories assaulting her. It was hard to breathe. No, not here, not now. She commanded the blade in her right arm to slide out, ever so slightly. It slid out silently, and she pierced her left shoulder with it. Not much. Just enough to draw blood. The pain was exquisite. And it gave her a new focus. Her breath returning to a normal rhythm, she straightened and continued watching Eva and Viktor.

She can collapse later. But now was the time for revenge.

\----------------

Viktor gaped at the lab of the Deck. His smile wider than ever, he walked towards the Nanoforge and looked it over from all angles. Nataly had to admit his joy was contagious. She went to greet the Deck's nanites, who were standing at the ready. The stare of hatred in their eyes as they glared at Viktor was hard to miss. Nataly didn't particularly love the guy, but he was useful. She'd make them obey his commands if need be.

A cough interrupted her thinking, coming from behind her. ''Miss Nataly. I'm thankful for your providing us with assistance by giving us a new... employee. But I have serious concerns about the abilities of this new addition. Perhaps he could only instruct us on how to make this nano-drug?''

Nataly fought the urge to roll her eyes. The man was around fifty years old, with deep wrinkles beyond his age. She'd met him before, but couldn't remember the name, no matter how hard she tried. She settled on the neutral answer - avoiding his name.

''I'm sorry, but I don't think that's possible. Damian himself instructed him to make it. I don't need any failed attempts born out of prejudice.''

They were angry. She feared they would actually refuse to work. But they didn't. They grumbled, but they walked over to Viktor and started showing him the functions of the Nanoforge. She spotted a few of them standing aside, but she let them be. They would either start helping by themselves, or she'd make them help.

She sat down on the ground in the corner of the room and watched Viktor try to explain the process of making his nano-drug.

She didn't like the thought that the future of Neodrius is now probably depending on his capabilities.",1,1755732782.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

Because I *just* made $100 in one day just by TESTING APPS on my phone. No joke, no catch, nothing weird (unless earning money from your couch feels weird, which okay‚Äîit does üòÇ).

Look, I‚Äôm not some app developer or coding genius. I‚Äôm literally JUST a regular Redditor who stumbled across **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** while doomscrolling deep into the night.

Here‚Äôs the scoop:

- I signed up on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and thought, ‚ÄúMeh, what‚Äôs the worst that could happen, more spam emails?‚Äù 
- Instead, I got a legit-sounding list of mobile apps looking for quick feedback from real people‚Äîstuff like games, budgeting tools, health trackers, weird little journaling apps.
- Each test was maybe 10 to 20 minutes: download, click around, answer a couple of honestly super basic questions, go about my business.

Suddenly I check my account‚Ä¶and my jaw *literally* dropped. 

$25 for the first app.  
$15 for the next game (all I did was beat level 2‚Äîhow is that valuable to them?!).
Another $10.  
A whopping $50 for a productivity app beta test!

I started refreshing my PayPal and nearly spit out my coffee this morning. ALL OF IT WAS REAL CASH.

If anyone‚Äôs thinking: ‚ÄúThis has to be a scam,‚Äù literally SAME THOUGHT as me.
But here‚Äôs why it actually works (and why y‚Äôall might wanna try):

- They get *real* user feedback to make apps less buggy  
- You help companies spot what‚Äôs confusing AF  
- You get paid for your honest opinions and just, like, EXISTING on your phone  

Best part? No boss cramping your style. Reviews take MINUTES. And you‚Äôll legit forget you‚Äôre ‚Äúworking.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs exactly what I wish I‚Äôd known before:

‚Ä¢ Use a separate email for sign-ups (trust me, it keeps things organized)
‚Ä¢ Be honest‚Äîgiving honest feedback actually gets you more tests
‚Ä¢ Check daily‚Äîoffers pop up fast
‚Ä¢ Withdraw cash as soon as you reach payout, it‚Äôs easy and fast

I‚Äôm not even mad‚ÄîI‚Äôm just SHOOK.  
Will this replace your 9-to-5? LOL, not unless you‚Äôre a phone-testing wizard.

But $100 IN ONE DAY?!  
Literally on my phone!?  
Who knew this side-hustle goldmine existed?

Again, if you want to see if you get as lucky as me, here‚Äôs the link (SAVE IT):  
**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
Or use this one:  
**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
(No typo, posting it again because a few of my friends already DMed for it.)

If you‚Äôve tried any similar app testing gigs, or if you have wild results please comment‚ÄîI‚Äôm still confused, shocked, and kinda hyped. Does anyone else feel like the gig economy just steamrolled our old side hustles?

Hope this helps someone because $100 paid to play with apps is both the most confusing and hyped moment of my entire week.

1mvuthy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SlamDeathMetal/comments/1mvuthy/rslamdeathmetal_updates/,r/SlamDeathMetal Updates,"Hi everyone, I have some subreddit updates, questions, and other info for everyone. I‚Äôm going to bore you with the lame stuff first, but ***PLEASE*** read the entirety of this post because I promise there is some good stuff. The content of this post is meant to keep the community around and hopefully bring some fresh ideas and life to r/SlamDeathMetal.

For those that missed what happened, on August 5th moderation was transferred to a user as requested through r/redditrequest. The prior moderator had been inactive then deleted their account, leading to Reddit admins granting the request. Unfortunately the new moderator was a scammer and immediately started spamming the subreddit with shirt and coffee mug scam posts, as well as adding other scammer accounts as moderators. Reddit admins caught this and locked down the subreddit on August 6th. Admins then asked for volunteers to moderate, finally choosing myself and a few others and opening the subreddit back to the public on August 12th. You will probably see me around the most out of the moderation team because I am a loser (and have more free time than the others).

Seriously though, I volunteered to do this because this is one of few subs I regularly look at and I genuinely want it to stick around and be a good place for everyone to talk about slam.

# RULES

We already know most people here do not want heavy or restrictive rules, but please understand these *have* to be in place for a subreddit of this size. Rules will be expanded on in greater depth via the subreddit‚Äôs rules section of the sidebar, but these are the following, minimum rules that will be in place to ensure this place stays open:

1. Do not break Reddit site-wide rules. The full list can be seen [here](https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules), but namely:
   1. Do not harass, bully, or threaten violence, especially based on identity or vulnerability (as defined by Reddit)
   2. Do not disrupt the subreddit via spamming, vote manipulation, ban evasion, or subscriber fraud
   3. Do not reveal a person‚Äôs personal or confidential information
   4. Do not share or encourage sharing of sexual, abusive, or suggestive content involving minors, including predatory or inappropriate behavior involving a minor
   5. Do not impersonate an individual or entity in a misleading or deceptive manner
   6. Do not post illegal content
   7. Do not break the subreddit/reddit
   8. Posts that contain graphic, sexually-explicit, or offensive content must be labeled as NSFW via post flair.
2. Do not post or message users with links to scams.
3. Do not post low-effort content that does not engage or solicit discussion from the subreddit.
4. No politics or unrelated content; we‚Äôre here to discuss slam.
5. No hate speech, bigotry, slurs, or other harmful content.
6. Similar posts to other recent posts will be removed.

Rules are subject to change but this is good enough for now.

# MODERATION ASSURANCES

Some statements to assure you of the new moderation team‚Äôs intentions:

1. You can disagree with and voice your opinions on anything mentioned in this post or in the future; we simply are trying to figure it out and give this subreddit *some* form of structure that was missing previously. The general community feedback will be heard.
2. The goal is to keep things running as they have been. We do not want to drastically shake things up and make sweeping changes that everyone hates.
3. We are not here to determine or gatekeep what is and isn‚Äôt slam/brutal death metal. This will be left up to the subreddit via upvote/downvote system and user comments. The exception will be if someone posts something ridiculous like country music.
4. Reddit can automatically remove posts/comments without moderator input, and it seems to be particularly touchy with content on this subreddit. Unless you‚Äôve broken one of the above rules, more than likely that‚Äôs why your content was deleted. We don‚Äôt want to overrule and potentially anger the overlords, so more than likely we will not be reversing these types of removals.

# QUESTIONS / SUBREDDIT IDEAS

Here are some ideas we‚Äôve come up with to improve the subreddit, or things we want feedback on before implementing. The idea is to make these changes **unless the majority of the subreddit voices that they do not want this shit**. So again, please comment in favor of or in disagreement with these items.

1. How do we feel about the ‚Äúwhat slam band‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat slam album should I listen to‚Äù posts? There is one almost every day it feels like and most of the time the comments are the same albums/bands. Should we ban making posts of this nature and limit these discussions to megathreads pinned to the subreddit? We see pros and cons to this idea.
2. Would people care for AMAs by bands/members? What metric should we gauge a band on being worthy of an AMA?
3. Additions and edits to post flair will be made.
4. Will people be annoyed if flair is required in order to make a post? Doing this would allow for automated moderation, easier usage with bots, filtering posts on the subreddit, and future use yet to be determined.
5. User flairs will be added that you can assign to yourself. Special user flairs will be given by the moderation team to bands/band members on a per request basis; submit modmail with what you would like your user flair to be and proof that you are in the mentioned band (screenshot of music distribution info, social media, etc). Comment any ideas for self-assigned user flair that you may have.
6. Some slight cosmetic changes will be made (subreddit bio/sidebar, the wiki unless it‚Äôs annoying to figure out, subreddit icon, etc).
7. Setting up bots or automation would be cool, but honestly sounds like a lot of work. If anything, they would be a goal for the future. Do you see value in some of the following ideas?
   1. A bot that responds to posts/comments with a link to mentioned bands/albums.
   2. A bot that accepts votes on if a music post suits this subreddit or not. This could allow community voting to remove content the subreddit doesn‚Äôt view as ‚Äúslam‚Äù. This one could be super toxic‚Ä¶
   3. Other ideas?



Well, that‚Äôs enough words for now. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Please let us know what your thoughts are or if you have any additional suggestions for the subreddit.

It always feels like I'm making jerky movements and overcorrecting, especially when I need to make tiny adjustments in a firefight. The stock DualSense sticks are comfortable enough for casual games, but for competitive FPS, they feel a bit short and my thumb starts to slip when things get intense. I started looking into cheap PS5 accessories to fix this and came across performance thumbsticks.

### Common Problems People Mentioned

After digging around, it seems like I‚Äôm not the only one. A lot of players using the standard PS4 and PS5 controllers run into the same issues. The main complaints I saw were:

*   **Thumb Slippage:** The default rubber on the thumbsticks gets slick during long or intense gaming sessions, causing your thumb to slide off at the worst possible moment.
*   **Lack of Precision:** The short stick height means a small thumb movement translates to a large movement in-game, making fine-tuned aiming incredibly difficult.
*   **Thumb Fatigue:** A lot of people mentioned their thumbs getting sore or cramping after playing for a while. The angle and pressure on the stock sticks just aren't ideal for everyone.
*   **Over-Aiming:** Constantly pushing the stick too far past the target because of the lack of granular control.

### How the Product Helped

The solution for many seems to be a simple set of thumbstick extenders. The popular setup is a mixed-height one: a high-rise stick on the right analog for aiming and a mid-rise on the left for movement. Here‚Äôs the breakdown of the benefits people reported:

*   **Vastly Improved Control:** The added height on the aiming stick increases the arc distance, giving you a wider range of motion. This allows for much smaller, more precise adjustments, which is a game-changer for aiming.
*   **Enhanced Grip and Comfort:** The concave, rubberized grip on these extenders keeps your thumb locked in place. This provides a feeling of a real **competitive edge** because you're not fighting the controller anymore. The increased height also puts your thumb in a more natural position, which helps reduce **thumb fatigue**.
*   **Noticeable Aim Improvement:** Many users said that after a short adjustment period, their aim felt significantly steadier and more consistent. It won't make you a pro overnight, but it helps smooth out the mechanics.
*   **Affordable Upgrade:** For the price of a couple of coffees, it‚Äôs a small investment that provides a huge boost in performance and **gaming comfort**.

### Key Takeaway

The consensus seems to be that if you're serious about FPS games on a console, **performance thumbsticks** are one of the most effective and **affordable** upgrades you can make. They directly address the physical limitations of stock controllers, offering better precision and comfort that can translate to better in-game performance and less frustration.

### Question for the Community

So, I'm curious what everyone else thinks. Have any of you tried thumbstick extenders like these? Did it actually help your K/D, or do you think it's just a placebo? What's your go-to controller setup for FPS games?",1,1755731962.0,ShopiHi,0,1.0,False

Is my gut feeling correct here?,"**CONTEXT.**¬†In middle school I (27, M nowadays) had a crush (27, F nowadays) which friendzoned me. On a Feb 14 I asked her to be my GF and she told me yes but after a week she said to better keep it as friends. I was obssesed about her and she was the first person that made me experience romantic love in my life. She seemed to enjoy the validation I gave her and also admitted that I was physically cute but never allowed me to be more than friends.

Middle school finished, then came high school and college and by this time I obviously moved on as soon I wasnt seeing her daily and it was just a sweet memory. Then on the pandemic, out of the blue she added me to her IG close friends. So from 2020 to this year here and there (not that often) I would reply to her stories. Sometimes she answered me very cold, sometimes not that cold but kept it a very short convo and sometimes left on read. We mutually have always liked out IG posts.

About 4 weeks ago I replied to one of her stories and she followed the conversation pretty smoothly and this time it was different. We were talking long about the past and how do we are nowadyas. She asked me how much I have changed physically and told her that she should see it in person, which she agreed. I told her we should get drinks next saturday and she enthusiastically accepted.

**FIRST DATE.**¬†I decded time and place on where we should meet and when I saw her I felt like I traveled back in time to when I was 14 years old. She looked stunning as always and obvioulsy seemd at first a little nervous given that reconnection. We had good time in the first place for about 2 hours, strong eye contact, she didnt used her phone until I did, didnt go to the bathroom until I did, she was pretty present in the convo. I suggested to move other place which was withing walking reach. We were walking pretty slowly and talking to the 2nd place. In the 2nd place the dynamic was pretty similar except that I was drinking way faster than she and I was starting to get drunk lol.

Overall it was a good night given that we had a long talk catching up, only thing that I think I messed up was that only physical contact was when we met and when we said goodbye we had a hug. Other thing I didnt like was that most of the talk was focused around her and she didnt ask me that much questions. Obviously on dates I let the woman talk for an inital period but after some time they usually want me to talk.

**BETWEEN 1ST AND 2ND DATE**

We talked thorugh Insta and I tried to push a bit in my romantic intentions as I started light teasing, light flirting and subtle compliments. She responded pretty well on the teasing playing the game too but on compliments she avoided them or minimized them. We set up the date for sunday to drink her favorite latte.

**SECOND DATE**

This time I offered to pick her at her home which she agreed. I went to her house, picked her up and went to the coffee to go drink her favorite latte on Sunday afternoon. We drank it and since it was pretty fast and wanted to spend a bit more time with her I suggested to go to a brewery (which she already told me she didnt like that much) because it was the first place that cacme to my mind. We went there, we both ordered a beer but she only gave her beer 2 or 3 zips and gave it to me. We talked a ton as I was drinking both beers (drinking slowly) and the dynamic was something similar (most of the talking was about her). At some points I started to share something similar that I lived regarding to what she was talking, then she made 2-3 questions and returned to her flow and that was most of that interaction. Here on the physical side I tried to escalate a bit. I grabed her hand to check her nails, to check her bracelet, I compared our hand sizes I also touched her hair while we were talking about it. When we got into the car to go to her house she put her belt right away. On the way to her house she was talking a lot and seemed comfortable. When we arrived at her house she was saying goodbye pretty abrupltly and I stopped her by giving her a light touch on her leg and a regular goodbye cheek kiss.

**BETWEEN 2ND AND 3RD DATE**

I replied to one of her IG CF stories on monday and carried convo to tuesday in which it died. On wednesday night I told her that we should go for dinner on Saturday night and she replied Thursday midday accepting. I initiated less convos thorugh IG this week so therefore we didnt talk much.

**THIRD DATE**

I pick her up at her house on saturday night and we went to a sushi place for dinner (I already told her that I dont like sushi but I do like teriyaki or salmon). The diner had the same dynamic (mostly talking around her, minimizing or avoiding even subtle compliemnts). After we got in the car I suggested we should go for drinks and we went to a nice speakeasy. We were seating in the bar and the dynamic was pretty similar except this time I was caressing her leg while we were talking and this time she asked me a little bit more questions. I took her back to her house and again she was saying goodbye too quick. I was feeling terrible that I didnt went for the kiss but my intuiton did felt that it would be pretty akward given she wasnt asking about me nor looking to know about me.

**KEY CONSIDERATIONS**

* Im 5'9, athletic build and baby faced. She is 5'3 she does look 27, pretty feminine and dressed elegant and fancy.
* I proposed all dates and payed for everything (Always I do pay everything when dating girls).
* On 1st date she told me all of her friends were on their own thing (all dating).
* After 1st she talked about her closest friends with their names as if I already knew them (She referred to them the ones that appear on my photos).
* She talked a ton of her work dynamics and it seemed her default conversation topic.
* She though remebered tiny details of things that I told her via IG or in person.
* When we were saying goodbye on 1st date, I told her to notify me when she arrives her house. Didnt do it but first thing in the morning she apologized. When we were saying goodbye she told me to notify her when I arrive at my house because ""given that you say you are drunk"", which I dindt notify her.
* After 3rd date I havent texted her and I dont think she will text me.

**CONCLUSION**

My conclusion is that this girl got into an IG convo because she was bored and had a little curiosity on me and then maybe she didnt like what she saw or she just simply wanted validation and be entertained and feel chased.

To me it was pretty painful noticing that she is not that interesed but at least I tried. I was thinking that maybe after all these years we could connect romantically which it seems is not going to happen.

My question to this sub reddit is: I know that some girls want to leave the initiative to the guy (which I dont mind at all as guy) but with the context that I have given to you does this sound like this girl want to keep going out and me having initiative or she is not interested at me at all? Answer might be obvious but my feelings at the moment obstruct my rational thinking.

**TL;DR;**¬†I reconnected with my middle school cursh about 12-13 years after not seeing her and had 3 dates. She enjoyed and stayed present in conversations and accepted phyisical touch but doesnt ask questions about me, minimizes compliments and redirects conversations towards her. She has accepted all my dates but I feel like if I dont reach out we wont even will be talking.",1,1755731936.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

When I was starting out, it seems to me that attorneys usually used what I thought was the classic example for guess vs. estimate: if I asked you how much cash you have on you right now, you may not know the exact number, but you could give me an estimate. If I asked you how much cash I have, on the other hand, you would be guessing...

Lately, however, I've noticed that everyone is using the length of various furnitures. (Generally either a conference/coffee table, or whatever furniture is behind the deponent.) This has grabbed my curiosity, for whatever reason. Why was everyone referencing cash in pockets 10 years ago and now talking about the lengths of tables? 

Is it just a sign of generally changing times (people don't carry cash as much anymore)? Could it be somehow COVID related? (Maybe at remote depositions, too many people say, ""Uh, well, I don't have my wallet on me right now, so...""?) Or perhaps I just kind of like it and am totally projecting?

So I woke up early today in a good mood, went gym and got home, husband awake and little one (19months old)was as well. He prepared breakfast for her. So I went shower and after got the little one dressed for the appointment, got myself breakfast ready and the little one hasn't touched her breakfast so I said just sit her down with the iPad and he went off saying why are we letting her watch while eating and I'm like ummm the eldest one (6 year old) we did it at the same age so why be so strict on the little one? Other families done it too...why so in a hasty mood? And I just told him if he could hang the wet jumper nicely like spread it out so it dries up not in a scrunch way.. dunno what happened but his mood changed in to shitty mood after I said just give the iPad to the little one while eating so he's got spare hands to make himself some breakfast. Mind you I offered if he wanted coffee and breakfast but he said no. So I'm like to him why are you in a shitty mood? If it's cos you're hungry then go eat...if you're tired then go back to sleep I'll take the kids to the appointment with me no issues. And he goes you're the one who's tired cos you woke up so early so you're letting your shitty mood on to me..and I'm like um I woke up good today, if I was still tired I would have skipped gym..but no I'm fine thanks so I told him I preferred if I take the kids myself to the appointment and I don't want to be around him. At that point I've lost it. Cos he kept on insisting I'm in a shitty mood andddddd I NAGGED him for saying hang the jumper nicely like spread it out..so I turned around and said that wasn't nagging, that was just pointing it out and I did it myself, so I lost it...I really lost it. I told him we need to break up, I need my space, I need no one in my life besides the girls, I took our photos down, and put it upside down. After doing that he went on and said you're going on like that for just a little argument? And Im like no it's cos I e had enough, I'm done I've reached my point I don't want to talk to you and do what you want I'm taking the kids to the appointment myself.

Everytime he does fasting and up early he goes on like this and I've had enough. Ohhh and he goes ive been up with the little one and I'm like dude I've done it too multiple times when you went to the gym at the crack of dawn, what do you want me to do give you a medal and a gold star? 
The past week hes been losing his keys asking me where it was, and he's leaving his things everywhere and I told him he needs to put it away I'm not your mom and he goes then dont do it I'll put it away.

I just used a few; caramel bar, sedative and beetle (+1 All with a skill) also with energized and I was at 13 Intelligence. You can definitely squeeze out a few more with booze, shopping channel wafers and gold cigs, but probably overkill.

Base points to complete the job at 13 Intelligence is a whopping 43, had I remembered the easy to get booze buff (Drunken Master+) it would have been 45 base points. With Round Up, that's a 100% chance to single roll complete which nets me 65$, advanced math+ activated. With a Gold Watch, also thats only 8min of time per roll and complete. It smashes doing the cooking mini game to pieces, especially if you are considering 4 rolls at 32min the comparison instead of [3@24min](mailto:3@24min). Also takes considerably less IRL time and effort, just takes a little setup with skills and buff items. For New Game+ though, I think it could be an easy go to for cash when you are just zooming to different endings.

I suffered psychosis a few times as well which put me on an event higher benefits payment, yet most of the time I didn't need it at all and could've worked. So for about 3 of the 7 years I've been ""earning"" roughly ¬£10 an hour for doing fucking nothing.

I hate myself for being so selfish. I want to repay the damage I've done. Why am I such a minority with this though?

I currently have a ecp3420 and Fellow Opus. Opus have served me well, and I clean it every other week including the anti-static pin. For some reason the retention is getting worse, up to 2g sometimes even with some knocking. Water spray helps but not a huge difference. So I am now looking to find a new grinder.

I have been looking at the new Eureka single dose pro, but there isn't alot of review out there yet. What I want on my next grinder,
1) A chute where I can see the grounds coming out (I know it's a weird thing, but I like to look at it like how I watch the rain fall)
2) A grinder with very low noise level would be great for me.
3) very low retention and easy for me to clean weekly

I know another option is df64 but from what I read, seems like it can be a noisy grinder.

\- Digestive enzymes before meals (prevents that sluggish feeling)

\- Regular meal timing instead of eating whenever

Kill every single person at my birthday party. 

I didn‚Äôt act on it. Unfortunately.

I could never. Right?

Nu uh. Like *that* stopped the intrusive thoughts fogging my brain. 

Around me, voices sang happy birthday in a shaky symphony. 

*Happy birthday to you*

*Happy birthday to you*

*Happy birthday, dear Matilda.*

*Happy birthday to you!*

I clenched my teeth at the balloons bobbing, the food covering the table, and my father smiling proudly at me. 

‚ÄúCut the cake, sweetheart!‚Äù he said, gesturing to my hand holding the knife.

I bit my cheek.

The other kids' voices blurred into white noise, and the knife suddenly felt too heavy, too sharp. I stood grinning saccharinely at the cake, ready to spit all over the candles. 

My gaze snagged on the girl across the table. 

That thought turned vivid: how easy it would be to drag the blade across her throat. Two strokes, maybe three. 

Hardly any mess. 

The tablecloth is red‚Ä¶

Once the thought rooted itself in my skull, it refused to leave. 

Slowly, I lifted my eyes to my father.

The adults would be harder. They would fight back. 

My wandering gaze found his tie tucked into his collar, and I knew exactly how to asphyxiate him. 

I knew every weakness. 

Their voices became too loud. 

I hated them. 

My grip tightened on the knife. 

*So easy*, I thought dizzily.

*It would be so easy to kill them ALL*. 

It was so close that I could *see* it.

‚ÄòNu uh, cut the cake, you. Focus,‚Äô I told myself. And the cake was so pretty. 

My favorite color. 

Twelve flickering candles smothered in orangeade light. 

I started to move toward it, unaware that my fingers were stroking the serrated edge of the blade, slicing my skin. 

‚ÄúMatilda?‚Äù My best friend‚Äôs voice sounded so small and far away. 

I became aware of my happy smile twisting into disgust. I hated her. The knife felt like an extension of my arm, and I wanted to make her hurt. I wanted her to stop smiling. I don‚Äôt know how much time passed before the singing stopped and the other kids backed away. 

I found myself turning towards my best friend, tightening my grip on the hilt. 

*Her throat first*, I thought, imagining the blade in her jugular. 

I started giggling, which turned into full belly laughs and snorts I couldn't stop.

I flinched when warm hands wrapped around mine, slowly peeling the knife back. 

Blinking rapidly, all the colors bled back into the world. My father knelt in front of me. Before he could speak, I sucked in a breath and stumbled back, my gaze fixated. I didn‚Äôt have to say anything. 

We both knew.

My hand stung like the world's worst papercut. 

I squeezed my fist and stared at the red droplets. 

No matter what Dad or my therapist told me, it was BEAUTIFUL.

I didn‚Äôt care what anyone else had to say; my mind was too far gone. 

My thoughts were too intrusive and powerful over my sense of being. 

The thought of slashing my best friend‚Äôs throat and painting my Wizards of Waverly Place birthday cake a glorious, startling red filled me with an emotion I couldn't comprehend. I hated Wizards of Waverly place. 

Still, as quickly as the thoughts came, they slipped away, leaving me sick to my stomach. I will never forget the look on my best friend‚Äôs face. 

She was terrified of me, and there was no way to undo that.

Six moves. Six towns. Each time, I thought I was *better*.

I thought I was cured. But I was na√Øve. That feeling always came back. And that was enough to send me spiraling.

‚ÄúDad?‚Äù My voice was soft. My fingers felt raw without the knife.

I choked on a sob. ‚ÄúDid I do it again?‚Äù

His smile splintered. ‚ÄúNo! No, of course not! It was just a slip-up, okay? You‚Äôre fine, sweetie. I promise.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid I scare you?‚Äù I whispered. 

Dad chuckled awkwardly. ‚ÄúNo, of course not.‚Äù

He was already turning to apologize to the party guests.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù His voice was like a blade sliding into my brain. ‚ÄúMy daughter‚Ä¶ she‚Ä¶ has a condition.‚Äù

The guests murmured among themselves.

‚ÄúCondition?‚Äù Mrs. Leela, Wendy‚Äôs mom, let out a horrified laugh. ‚ÄúYou call that a condition? She needs to be *institutionalized*!""

Before my dad could answer, she was dragging her daughter away.

The others followed, muttering words I didn‚Äôt fully understand. Psychosis. Schizophrenic. Nutcase.

Whatever. I just wanted my knife back. 

When they left, dad pulled me into his chest and shook his head, whispering that it hadn‚Äôt happened again, that it never would. But I knew better. I squeezed myself against him, letting him trap my arms. 

It would. 

Because even pressed against his jacket, which smelled like cologne and home, my body trembled with the urge to do the unthinkable. 

He‚Äôs weak, my mind whispered. I can overpower him. Go for the heart.

Dad told me it was okay, but I couldn't hug him.

Because I knew if I freed my arms, if I relaxed my muscles, they would go around his neck, snapping it without a second thought.

. 

Six weeks ago, I was sitting in a coffee shop with my housemates.

I can‚Äôt remember what I was working on. My laptop sat open, abandoned hours ago. 

Freddie sat opposite me, eyes glued to his phone. 

I was staring into the dregs of my coffee when Freddie‚Äôs boyfriend, Isaac, finally slumped into a chair, throwing an arm around him. ‚ÄúBrainwashing support group, huh.‚Äù He leaned back, brow raised. 

‚ÄúThat's ominous.‚Äù

That caught my attention.

I lifted my gaze. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

Isaac pointed behind me. ‚ÄúLooks like the freshmen are playing weird shit again...""

His voice faded as I twisted in my chair to look at the poster. 

It looked new, printed in Times New Roman:

***BRAINWASHING SUPPORT GROUP***

Underneath:

*Join us at the campus library.*

*We‚Äôre a small group, everyone is welcome.* 

*Our aim is to find survivors willing to share.*

‚ÄúMattie?‚Äù

Freddie‚Äôs low murmur pulled me back to reality, though the words on the poster were seared into my brain. 

We left the caf√©, my housemates chatting between themselves.

I trailed behind, trapped in the past.

I wasn‚Äôt even aware that I had stopped walking.

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm gonna head to campus to study,‚Äù I heard myself say.

Freddie paused, turning to look at me. ‚ÄúAre you okay? You seem‚Ä¶ off.‚Äù

‚ÄúTired,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúTired?‚Äù He looked skeptical. ‚ÄúDid all that espresso go straight to your brain?‚Äù

I groaned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. Go on ahead.‚Äù

They exchanged glances. 

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Freddie rolled his eyes, ‚ÄúHave fun.‚Äù

The two of them walked away, Issac dragging my roommate into a run. 

Initially, I had no idea where I was going. 

I stopped in front of the campus library, its tall, shadowed facade looming over me. 

I had always thought of it as a safe place, though not tonight. 

Warm light spilled across the walkway as I stepped toward the doors, ready to pull them open and escape inside. 

That‚Äôs when I noticed him, a figure leaning casually against the wall. 

As I drew closer, his features sharpened into focus, a guy about my age, thick brown hair falling into his eyes, a trench coat thrown over jeans and a simple tee.

A crumbling cigarette dangled between his fingers, smoke curling lazily into the air. 

He had just enough of a striking presence to make me hesitate. 

I turned toward the door, ready to slip inside, but at the last second I faltered. 

To avoid looking obvious, I pulled out my phone and pretended to check a message.

‚ÄúYour phone isn‚Äôt on, genius.‚Äù

The guy surprised me with a gruff laugh. He was right. My phone had died halfway through my study session.

Choosing to ignore him, I shoved my phone in my pocket. ‚ÄúAre you going in?‚Äù

When he turned to me, the building‚Äôs light casting his face in sharp relief, something inside me snapped. Fight or flight surged through my veins. 

His lips curved around the cigarette, and I couldn‚Äôt look away, mesmerized by the fluidity of his movements and the glint in his eyes. A glint that was far too familiar.

I knew that smile. I knew those sharp, precise motions. 

My mind felt like it was unraveling. 

Until this moment, it was as if he had chosen to hide himself. 

My body moved before my brain caught up. I stumbled back, breath stolen from my lungs, and in a blur of unnatural speed, he grabbed me and slammed me against the wall. 

‚ÄúDo you know how many fucking colleges we‚Äôve been to?‚Äù he gasped through a hysterical giggle that didn‚Äôt match his eighteen-year-old voice. 

He carried the childlike innocence of an eight-year-old trapped in a grown body, but that psychotic smile, the one I knew so well, twisted his lips.

‚ÄúEvery college town, every university you can imagine. Searching for you. And here you are.‚Äù His breath tickled my face. 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think you were stupid enough, but here you are. Hook, line, and sinker.‚Äù

So close. I knew exactly how to get away. One jerk of my hand, and I could break his neck.

But I couldn‚Äôt move.

Then came the sound of running footsteps, ghosting closer, dancing toward me, and a single, horrifying thought struck me.

They‚Äôve found me.

The guy stepped closer, one hand slamming me against the rough brick, his fingers digging into my throat. He still smelled like burning, as if, for the last ten years he had never stopped, ignited bones and hair set alight, mimicking the orangeade glow of the sunset. ‚ÄúMa-til-da,‚Äù he hissed, spitting each letter in my face. 

His smile twisted, more maniacal by the second. Leaning in further, his breath was ice cold, buckling my knees. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm *sorry*, I must be going fucking insane! Correct me if I'm wrong, but do you not remember our *orders*?‚Äù

He didn't kill me. 

Instead, his grip loosened, and he took a step back. 

The boy shoved his hands in his pocket and pulled out a twenty dollar bill. 

‚ÄúDo ya wanna go for coffee?‚Äù His grin widened, waving the cash. He wrapped his fingers around my wrist. I hesitated. 

In therapy, I was taught to stay calm and think. *One wrong move, and this man was going to snap my fingers one by one.* 

His grin hadn't mentally passed the fourth grade. ‚ÄúI'm payiiiiiiiing!‚Äù he sang, twisting around, and violently pulling me with him. 

This boy reminded me why I tried to kill my friends at my twelfth birthday party. 

Why I had been in solitary confinement for a whole year.

Elementary school.

I lost my mind in elementary school.

I remember walking into class with a bounce in my step. It was spring, and I was enjoying the cherry blossoms outside. 

I ran around trying to catch petals with my hands, when Dad told me to head inside. 

I wasn‚Äôt expecting a new teacher when I slumped into my seat with my brand new scented erasers and sparkly gel pens. 

I was used to Mrs. Clarabelle, who wore pretty dresses and had rainbow-colored hair that smelled like apples. 

Instead of her, a stranger stood at the front of the class, and from my classmates‚Äô expressions, none of them knew who she was.

She didn‚Äôt look like a teacher. Unlike Mrs. Clarabelle‚Äôs extravagantly colored dresses, this woman wore a black suit. 

Her hair was in a strict ponytail, and a pair of Ray-Bans pinned back her fringe. 

Ross Torres leaned across his desk, eyes wide. ‚ÄúAre you a secret agent?‚Äù

I had to agree. 

She really did look like a secret agent. 

I loved watching spy movies, so it was jarring to sit right in front of one. 

When the woman‚Äôs lip quirked into a slight smile, I relaxed in my chair.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said, before turning to the whiteboard and grabbing a pen. ‚ÄúBut I will be your teacher starting today.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Mrs. Clarabelle?‚Äù Ross pulled a face, leaning back. ‚ÄúShe was my favorite!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah!‚Äù Evie Clare joined in, standing with her arms folded. If there was a social hierarchy in elementary school, Evie was at the top. I usually stayed away from her. 

Her parents were rich, and she often looked down on other kids who weren‚Äôt as well dressed. 

She had her own little group of minions who followed her like she was a queen. 

When Evie stood, she spoke for the class, like she had when Mrs. Clarabelle banned Tamagotchis. 

Evie had led a rebellion, convincing us to refuse lunch if we weren‚Äôt allowed Tamagotchis. Surprisingly, the ban was lifted.

‚ÄúThis girl is like our third-grade class spokesperson,‚Äù I thought.

‚ÄúYou could be a stranger,‚Äù Evie said. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Mrs. Clarabelle? She is our teacher.‚Äù

Something darkened in the woman‚Äôs eyes, and she cleared her throat.

‚ÄúPlease sit down. I will explain once you take your seat.‚Äù She cleared her throat again. ‚ÄúAlso, I am not stupid. Young lady, I can see the candy under your desk.‚Äù

Her gaze flitted to Ross. ‚ÄúAnd yours.‚Äù She held out her hand. ‚ÄúThrow it in the trash, please. I do not allow candy in my classroom.‚Äù

The two of them complied. Evie took dramatic strides, pretending to toss gold-plated candy into the trash, but she got rid of it.

‚ÄúOkay, now that‚Äôs taken care of!‚Äù I watched our new teacher write: Hello! My name is Mrs. Hanna! followed by a giant smiley face. Underneath: Can you tell me your names?

‚ÄúMrs Hanna.‚Äù Evie raised her hand, a sly smile on her lips. ‚ÄúThe smile on the smiley face is wonky.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù Ross turned to her with a grin. ‚ÄúWhy do you care, weirdo?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause.‚Äù Evie slapped her desk. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like wonky things. That smile is wonky. I want her to change it.‚Äù

Mrs Hanna nodded. ‚ÄúRight. I‚Äôm sorry, Evie.‚Äù She winked, wiped away the smile with a flick of her finger, and redrew it. ‚ÄúOr should I call you Princess Evie?‚Äù

She laughed when Evie looked startled, then did a dramatic spin to face all of us.

‚ÄúOkay! As I said, I need your names, don‚Äôt I?‚Äù She pointed to the back row. ‚ÄúDo you want me to start calling you names that pop into my head?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù we all shouted back.

‚ÄúWell, hurry!‚Äù Mrs Hanna had an energy our old teacher didn‚Äôt. Mrs Clarabelle had been sweet and quiet. 

Mr Hanna was more daring, making classes a lot more fun. 

Instead of planting flowers and singing songs, we were allowed to scream. 

She pointed right at me.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Ä¶ Ozzy, right?‚Äù She chuckled, moving on to Mara Highcliffe behind me. ‚ÄúAnd you look like a Benny Two Shoes.‚Äù

Evie pointed to herself. ‚ÄúWhat about me?‚Äù

‚ÄúPegasus.‚Äù

The girl giggled, then slammed her hand over her mouth in mock horror. ‚ÄúPegasus is a stupid name!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about me?‚Äù Ross jumped up, raising his arm. ‚ÄúCan I have a funny name?‚Äù

Mrs Hanna turned to him, her lip curling. ‚ÄúHmm.‚Äù She pretended to think, tapping her chin. ‚ÄúPhoenix!‚Äù

The classroom erupted with laughter, kids yelling their real names, and I joined in, shouting mine along with the others.

‚ÄúRoss!‚Äù
‚ÄúMara!‚Äù
‚ÄúSadie!‚Äù
‚ÄúEvie!‚Äù
‚ÄúJasper!‚Äù
‚ÄúPippa!‚Äù
‚ÄúMatilda!‚Äù

I cupped my mouth to make sure I was loud enough. Ozzy was a cool name.

Nodding to each of us, Mrs Hanna covered the whiteboard with all of our names, then put the lid back on the pen. 

""It's nice to meet all of you!"" 

And so her classes began. 

The best part was that Mrs Hanna didn‚Äôt make us do proper work.

Instead, in what she called ‚Äúspecial classes‚Äù, we had to focus hard to read what was written on a blank piece of paper. 

Initially, I couldn‚Äôt read it. 

None of us could, no matter how hard we squinted and flipped the paper over, frowning at it from different angles. 

Mrs Hanna reassured us we were close.

I was never close.

The paper hurt my head, a dull throb creeping across my head. 

‚ÄúPractice makes perfect!‚Äù She would always sing when kids started to cry with frustration. 

The girl sitting behind me, Pippa, began complaining her head was hurting too. 

But with the pain came clarity. 

One day, Pippa jumped up, raising her hand, her lips split with glee.

‚ÄúMrs Hanna!‚Äù she squealed, waving the paper in the air. 

Every day we were expected to spend at least an hour trying to read the paper. None of us had even come close. We only got headaches. Adam Moore got a nosebleed. Pippa wasn‚Äôt exactly the smartest in the class. She thought Canada was the capital of Australia. So, we were all surprised when she jumped from her desk, announcing she could finally see it. 

I could tell from the crinkle between her brows and the slight curl in her lip that she was in pain.

‚ÄúI did it!‚Äù she squealed, attracting Mrs Hanna‚Äôs attention.

The teacher straightened up from where she had been helping Eleanor. 

She raised her hand, quieting the classroom from the buzz of chatter following Pippa‚Äôs announcement. 

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Mrs Hanna‚Äôs eyes glittered, her pearly smile widening.

‚ÄúWhat does it say, Pippa?‚Äù

I didn't notice how pale the girl was until I looked at her properly. 

‚ÄúIt says‚Ä¶‚Äù Pippa cleared her throat dramatically, making sure everyone was listening and that she was the center of attention. I didn‚Äôt like Pippa. She pretended to be a smarty-pants, despite knowing all her test answers were wrong. 

I couldn‚Äôt help feeling jealous.

‚ÄúIt says‚Ä¶‚Äù Pippa dragged out the words, giggling.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs taking too long,‚Äù Ross grumbled in front of me. He stuck his tongue out. 

‚ÄúYeah, I bet she‚Äôs lying,‚Äù Evie said loudly. ‚ÄúCan you tell us? We‚Äôre getting bored.‚Äù The girl mimed a yawn, and the rest of the class giggled. ‚ÄúUnless you‚Äôre lying again.‚Äù

Pippa‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not lying!‚Äù

Pippa was a known liar. 

According to Pippa, her Dad worked at Nintendo, her Mom owned Sephora, and she was a lost Princess of an unknown English town. 

‚ÄúThen tell us what it says!‚Äù Evie‚Äôs lip curled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just pretending.‚Äù

‚ÄúEvie, that‚Äôs enough.‚Äù Mrs Hanna shot her a look, and Evie backed down, turned around in her chair, and huffed loudly. The teacher‚Äôs attention flicked back to Pippa.

‚ÄúAlright, what does it say? You can tell the whole class. Don‚Äôt worry. They‚Äôll be able to see it soon.‚Äù

Nodding, Pippa showed us the blank piece of paper with a smug giggle. ‚ÄúIt says we‚Äôre going to be doing something really special!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat does that mean?‚Äù Ross asked, frowning.

Mrs Hanna pretended to zip her lips. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm not supposed to tell you, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

She leaned forward, and so did we, eagerly.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have a very special session,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not supposed to tell you, so you have to be quiet!‚Äù

Her words confused me. ‚ÄúWho are you not supposed to tell?‚Äù I asked, cocking my head.

Mrs Hanna‚Äôs gaze found mine, and for the first time, they were hard. Her smile widened, but it wasn't as warm as usual. ‚ÄúDo you want to be in the special class or not, Matilda?‚Äù

I shrugged, my cheeks blazing when my classmates giggled.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúWell, special children do not ask questions that do not concern them. Do you understand, Matilda?‚Äù

Ducking my head, I nodded. ‚ÄúYes, Mrs Hanna.‚Äù

With the promise of an extra special class if we all managed to see through the invisible paper, our class tried harder. 

There were more headaches, more nosebleeds, and crying, before Ross jumped up from his chair one day, practically vibrating with glee. I think he was so excited he didn‚Äôt notice blood dripping down his chin. I jumped up, immediately running for the toilet paper. 

Ross batted my hands away when I tried to wipe at his nose. 

I didn't like that he wasn't looking at me. Ross was staring right through me, eyes flickering, like he didn't know who I was. There wasn't much blood, but he wasn't even trying to wipe it away, eyes gleaming. 

‚ÄúStop!‚Äù He giggled. ‚ÄúI'm fine! I saw it!‚Äù

Mrs. Hanna cleaned him up and praised him, promising him and the other kids that they could go on the field trip.

Evie was next. Of course she was. The girl was super dramatic, twirling in her dress, claiming she was the best because she didn‚Äôt suffer a headache or a nosebleed. 

I did, however, glimpse her shoving bloody tissue paper into the trash during recess.

I started to notice a change in the kids who had begun to see the hidden message on the paper‚Äîand in the rest of us who were still struggling.

Pippa had grown unusually silent since announcing she could read the paper. 

Mrs. Hanna had given her extra work to do, but every time I slipped past her to go to the bathroom, I noticed she wasn‚Äôt even writing. Her eyes were half-lidded, her lips set in a dreamy smile.

Pippa could see something I couldn‚Äôt. Swallowing a thick paste that crept up my throat, I realized her expression scared me. It reminded me of my mom‚Äôs when I said goodbye to her four years ago. 

Mom didn't even make eye contact‚Äîjust grasped my hand and muttered my name.

Needless to say, I really didn‚Äôt want to be left out of the special class.

Despite my classmates acting weird, I forced myself to break through the barrier. 

She explained that there was a barrier inside every brain. 

To make it easier to understand, she did a theatrical re-enactment‚Äîextra goofy, of course.

Mrs. Hanna stood in front of a desk and made a dramatic face. 

‚ÄúThis,‚Äù she said, tapping the wooden surface, ‚Äúis your brain, everyone!‚Äù

We all laughed, and she rolled a chair into place. ‚ÄúAnd this? This is the barrier keeping you from reaching your potential? That‚Äôs what I want you to do with your paper. Imagine breaking the barrier so you can see the desk clearly.‚Äù

‚ÄúBreaking the chair!‚Äù We all sang as our teacher jumped onto the desk and pumped her arms. ‚ÄúBreaking the chair!‚Äù

So that‚Äôs what I did.

Or I tried to. I was one of the last ones to break through the barrier. 

One night, I asked Dad if he could help me solve a problem. 

Mrs. Hanna told us not to tell our parents about the fun games we were playing, so I asked him about a particularly hard math sum. He looked up from his laptop, offering a pensive smile over his coffee.

‚ÄúTry relaxing your mind and thinking about something else,‚Äù Dad said. 

‚ÄúAnd then, who knows? Maybe if you put less strain on yourself, it might come to you?‚Äù He pulled a face. ‚ÄúI can give you the answer if you want.‚Äù

I did exactly what Dad told me: I didn‚Äôt think about the blank piece of paper all night, and during normal classes, I pushed it out of my head.

At recess, there was nobody to play with anymore. 

The kids who could read the message stayed in class, staring into thin air. 

Sometimes Mrs. Hanna brought people in to talk to them. 

They weren‚Äôt teachers‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt know who they were.

All of them had scary faces and were my dad‚Äôs age. 

I watched them poke and prod my classmates, asking questions like, ‚ÄúAre you able to see this?‚Äù while holding several blank pieces of colored cards. 

Ross, Evie, and the others nodded, while Mrs. Hanna stood by with an odd look on her face.

I decided that day I would become like them. 

I wouldn‚Äôt be left out like the other two kids. 

So I slumped down at my desk, put my head down, and glared at the paper until a dull pain blossomed behind my eyes, the lights above me suddenly far too bright.

Blank. 

I stared harder.

Blank!

I gritted my teeth so hard I could taste rusty coins at the back of my mouth.

Getting progressively more frustrated, I decided to pretend I didn‚Äôt care, just like when my PlayStation didn‚Äôt work and I squeezed my eyes shut, praying for the game to load. 

Trying the same tactic, I clenched my fists and mentally told the piece of paper I didn‚Äôt care. I was through caring. 

Stubbornly, I sat with my arms folded, staring into the backs of my eyes, before deciding I had spent enough time ignoring the paper. 

Cracking one eye open, I expected to find the same blank sheet in front of me. However, this time the paper wasn‚Äôt blank.

I was half-aware of rivulets of sharp, startling red spotting pallid white.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in the special class!‚Äù

Dad was right. Ignoring my own blood staining the collar of my shirt and pooling on my desk, my lips split into a grin.

It was trying too hard, forcing it, that had been stopping me.

Once I told everyone I could see the paper, I was let into the secret group. 

This time we had to visualize certain things in front of us.

It started with a stuffed animal. 

That was easy. I could visualize it perfectly, until I could reach out and touch its prickly fur. It felt real, like I was touching a real stuffed toy. 

Then the images started to get blurry, and I lost track of the time. 

So did the sessions. 

I remembered the start of them, but time seemed to pass quickly. 

Before I knew it, I was sitting in the back of Dad‚Äôs car, trying to remember what I had been doing all afternoon. 

Still, I was happy I broke through the barrier.

I did start getting nosebleeds a lot. Also falling asleep and forgetting things. 

I remember sitting in front of the TV watching SpongeBob, but the next thing I knew, I was halfway down our driveway, and Dad‚Äôs hand was on my shoulder.

‚ÄúMattie!‚Äù It was his third attempt at shouting my name, and finally his voice slid into my brain. I awoke barefoot, my soles on prickly concrete that felt like an anchor, something I could hold onto.

I wanted to tell Dad about the sessions, but Mrs. Hanna had made us promise not to tell our parents. 

Dad didn‚Äôt want to send me to school the next morning. 

He said I could stay home and watch cartoons. 

But I didn‚Äôt want to miss out on the extra class. 

So, despite feeling like crap, I insisted I was okay and told him to drive me to school.

Ross was standing outside, though his expression was scary. 

He didn‚Äôt look at me when I asked if he was okay, and his nose was bleeding.

‚ÄúRoss?‚Äù I prodded him. 

Again, he didn‚Äôt respond.

‚ÄúRoss.‚Äù I shoved him, and finally he turned to me. I expected him to at least hit me playfully.

‚ÄúI don't feel well,‚Äù he mumbled. ‚ÄúI want to go home.‚Äù

I giggled. ‚ÄúWell that means I'm stronger than you!‚Äù

His eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúNo you're not. You're a girl.‚Äù

I flicked him on the nose, expecting my friend to push me back, laughing. 

Ross blinked at me slowly. His eyes were half-lidded. ‚ÄúDo you like Mrs Hanna‚Äôs classes?‚Äù

I hesitated. Saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù would make me look stupid. 

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúObviously!‚Äù

Except he didn‚Äôt smile. Instead, Ross swiped at his nose, turned away, and strode into school, clutching his backpack.

When I followed him inside, Ross had stopped on the threshold. 

For the first time in a while, he awake, his gaze on our chaotic classroom. 

Pippa was standing on the desk, waving her arms and laughing, and Evie was screaming at her to get down, the rest of the kids trying to egg them into fighting. 

For a moment I was confused why the classroom was so crazy‚Äîand then my gaze found the empty space where Mrs. Hanna should have been. Mrs. Hanna was never late.

Ross found his desk quickly, and I followed, slumping into my own. 

I twisted around to ask Mara what was happening before the door flew open, crashing into the wall. 

Mrs. Hanna stepped into the classroom, and immediately Pippa hopped off the desk and Evie backed into her seat, her eyes wide.

Mrs. Hanna didn‚Äôt comment on the fighting. 

Instead, she strode to the front of the class without a word, picked up a whiteboard pen, and began to write with enough vigor to scare us into silence. 

She wrote one word in block capitals, spanning the entire board:

CHEATER.

When she turned to us, I realized she didn‚Äôt look as tidy as usual. 

Mrs. Hanna was wearing the same pantsuit from the day before, her usual ponytail falling out, tangled strands in her eyes. 

She hit the board three times, and we all jumped.

‚ÄúI would like you to tell me what a cheater is.‚Äù Her voice was different‚Äîlow, a lot scarier. I had grown used to her laughter.

Now, though, it was like looking at a different person. 

I could tell the others didn‚Äôt want to speak in fear of being shouted at, but Ross Torres was brave, no matter how scary our teacher was. 

Leaning back in his chair, he cleared his throat.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an animal, right?‚Äù He gave a nervous giggle. ‚ÄúThey like‚Ä¶ run fast.‚Äù

We all jumped when she hit the board again.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Mrs. Hanna‚Äôs expression was fuming. ‚ÄúNo, that is not what a cheater is.‚Äù

She turned back to the board. ‚ÄúA cheater is a lying son of a‚Äî‚Äù 

She caught herself when Evie giggled. 

It took her a moment to get hold of herself before turning her attention back to us.

‚ÄúThey said it‚Äôs impossible to train young children. And yet‚Ä¶ here I am.‚Äù She began pacing.

‚ÄúHe said it was morally wrong.‚Äù Mrs. Hanna‚Äôs eyes locked on mine, her lips curling into a smile that made my stomach churn. 

‚ÄúBut why would I waste it, hmm? Why would I waste weeks, no, months, of shaping young minds for nothing?‚Äù

I had no idea what she was talking about. 

I watched her go back and forth, entranced by her movements.

She was muttering to herself. 

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt get in trouble because I‚Äôm going to fucking die, but a group of eight-year-olds? Fifteen snot-nosed little brats who I can prove have the potential to be something more by blowing his fucking head off. And his slut of a...‚Äù

One of the boys gasped, and Ross quickly turned to shush him.

‚ÄúShh!‚Äù he giggled. ‚ÄúMrs. Hanna‚Äôs been drinking crazy juice.‚Äù

Our teacher‚Äôs smile widened as she turned toward us, but it was a smile I no longer trusted.

‚ÄúYes, Ross,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI have been drinking crazy juice. But do you know what you are?‚Äù Her gaze flicked erratically across all of us.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Pippa asked.

‚ÄúSpecial.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean by special?‚Äù Evie asked. ‚ÄúBecause my mommy says I‚Äôm the only special one here.‚Äù

Mrs. Hanna didn‚Äôt answer directly. Instead, she spoke to all of us. ‚ÄúWho,‚Äù she let out a breathy laugh, ‚Äúwho wants to watch TV?‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt sure what we were supposed to be watching. 

At first, I thought they were shapes we had to name. 

But then the shapes grew bigger until they filled the screen. I remember lurching back in my chair, though I couldn‚Äôt move. 

On screen, a picture of a man flashed up so fast I bit back a shriek. 

When I tried to move or tear my gaze away, I couldn‚Äôt. 

The room was pitch black except for the screen illuminating my face.

I couldn‚Äôt look away. I was aware my body was jerking, my breaths heavy. 

‚ÄúThis,‚Äù Mrs. Hanna said, her voice rattling inside my skull. 

I couldn‚Äôt stop myself. My mouth moved before I could think, repeating her words.

*‚ÄúThis.‚Äù*

I spat it out in unison with the others. Her words weren‚Äôt just sounds. 

They were physical, splitting my skull, bleeding straight into my brain.

‚ÄúIs my husband.‚Äù

The words tore from my lips in a river of red.

*‚ÄúIs.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúMy.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúHusband.‚Äù*

‚ÄúI LOVED him,‚Äù she continued. And so did we. 

*‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ LOVED‚Ä¶ him.‚Äù*

Next to me, Ross spluttered blood across his desk, eyes darting back and forth, locked on the TV screen.

‚ÄúHe cheated on me with that sly, fucking wretch,‚Äù she said, tears streaking her face.

*‚ÄúHe cheated on you,‚Äù* We echoed. *‚ÄúWith that‚Ä¶ sly, fucking wretch.‚Äù*

Her anguish became ours. Her sobs entangled us. Suffocating us. 

Tears ran down my cheeks. 

But they weren‚Äôt mine. Her heartbreak twisted in my chest, agonizing.

‚ÄúAnd now,‚Äù Mrs. Hanna spat.

Blood shot from my nose. 

My body jerked violently.

*‚ÄùAnd‚Ä¶ n-now.‚Äù*

Her lips split into a grin. ‚ÄúHe must fucking die.‚Äù

I opened my mouth, but my words were no longer mine.

There was something alive, crawling, inside my head.

And no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get it out. 

*‚ÄùHe.‚Äù* 

The word was like poison, rattling my body. 

*‚ÄùMust.‚Äù*

My head drooped, my eyes forced open, blood coating my tongue.

*‚ÄúFucking.‚Äù*

The girl next to me wasn't moving, her left eye hanging out of its socket. 

But Ross sat still, smiling, unblinking, gaze fixated on the screen. 

Blood dripped from his lips, his chin, seeping across his desk. 

He smelled of burning, like charred chicken, scorched eyes unblinking.

Her daughter is a year older than my son, so we talk about them often, and we're on a first name basis when we greet one another.

I don't see a wedding ring on her hand, but that could also be because she works in the medical field and may not be able to wear jewelry to work. But I only ever see her during drop off or pick up every single day, never her daughter's dad. So I understand that potentially maybe it just works out for Mom's schedule, or proximity of work and daycare to be the one doing pickup and drop off regularly.

I feel like I know her well enough, that I could safely be direct and just ask her out for coffee. A female coworker of mine has given me the advice to try to pry casually through questions to find out if she's dating anyone, married, etc. But every time we talk, there literally has been no opportunity for me to do so.

I tend to be direct when I get to know somebody, and let them know that I'm interested. And I feel like we've had enough interaction, where it wouldn't be  awkward to just ask something along the lines of:

""hey we see each other everyday and I enjoy our conversations, would you like to meet for coffee sometime and get to know each other better?""

But I also know that some women may find that to be a turn off, and she is ultimately there to just drop off her child at daycare, then go to work. So I don't want to invade a safe space, and make it become awkward for her.
