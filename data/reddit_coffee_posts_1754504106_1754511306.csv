1mjfajq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schizotypal/comments/1mjfajq/i_am_so_scared/,I am so scared,"I began to suspect I may have schizotypal because of a connection to a friend who is diagnosed with it. For the first time I was around someone who thinks in a way that echoes my own (though not exactly, because we are different people). My therapist feels quite strongly that I meet all criteria but I am struggling very much to trust her opinion. 

This has made me horribly afraid that I have not discovered anything about myself and all I have actually done is unconsciously steal someone‚Äôs identity without even realizing it. I am so scared. I have largely given up trying to explore the schizotypal possibility because every time I do, I feel like I‚Äôm doing something evil. I‚Äôm scared to express myself around friends because every time I think I am being more ‚Äúhonest‚Äù, I get a horrible feeling that I am a liar, I am manipulating everyone, I am dirty and they will all eventually find me out. 

Even writing this has my heart pounding. I have been so scared to share this with people that I have been trying to put it into words for weeks, maybe months. 

I am scared of taking on bits and pieces from friends. I love my schizotypal friend‚Äôs style, and I have asked her for express permission to be influenced by it (which she happily gave). And yet, even though I truly, genuinely want to express myself this way I am out of my mind with fear. I feel like I am doing something horribly wrong. I love when people pick up inspiration or influence from me but it feels like I am deceiving everyone when I do it. 

The feelings of ‚Äúmaybe I don‚Äôt even exist. Maybe I‚Äôm not real. Maybe I‚Äôm just a horrible person‚Äù haunt me quite a lot. When I quit caffeine cold turkey and it made me a bit mentally low for a day I became so terrified that I have no real personality and everything I am was somehow given to me by caffeine that I started drinking coffee again. 

I don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone. I am so desperate to get to live a true and honest existence but the more I try, the more I become afraid and the more I become scared I don‚Äôt actually exist, that I am just a byproduct. I wish I had no external body. I wish I was just a mind. I‚Äôm not good at being physically perceived and I don‚Äôt like it. It‚Äôs messy and I am scared. ",1,1754511101.0,Schizotypal,0,1.0,False

I don‚Äôt love what I do.
Not exactly.

But I was born for it.
And I‚Äôm very, very good at it.

It‚Äôs not a 9-to-5.
There‚Äôs no clocking in, no coffee breaks, no PTO.
You don‚Äôt apply for this kind of job.
It finds you.

And the first thing they tell you ‚Äî the very first thing ‚Äî is:
Never tell anyone what you do.
Not your spouse. Not your family. Not your priest.

Not even yourself, if you can help it.

But lately, it‚Äôs been getting harder to ignore.
The weight of it. The screams of it.

So here I am.
Telling you.

‚∏ª

I guess the easiest way to explain it is this:

I clean up‚Ä¶ after things.
Unnatural things.

You know when a family just disappears from their home?
Car still in the driveway.
Dinner half-eaten.
No signs of struggle. Just‚Ä¶ gone?

That‚Äôs when I get a call.

Or when some hikers go off-trail and are found days later ‚Äî faces stretched in terror, skin blistered like it aged 100 years overnight?

That‚Äôs me, too.

But I‚Äôm not law enforcement.
Not military.
Not some paranormal investigator with a podcast and a night-vision camera.

I don‚Äôt ask questions.
I don‚Äôt take notes.
I remove.

Blood. Evidence. Sometimes entire houses.

And I do it well.

‚∏ª

My tools are custom.
They don‚Äôt have names ‚Äî just serial codes.
I‚Äôve got solvents that melt bone, vacuums that erase the residue of fear, gloves that never stain.

And then there‚Äôs the Black Book.
It‚Äôs always waiting on my kitchen table in the morning.

No knock. No call. Just there.
Heavy. Smells like dirt and ozone.

Inside is always the same:
A name.
A location.
And a set of rules.

Follow the rules.
That‚Äôs what keeps you alive.

‚∏ª

Let me give you an example.
A few months ago, I was sent to a house in Oregon.

A cabin. Deep woods.
No roads on Google Maps.

The Black Book said:

RULE 1: Do not look in the mirrors.
RULE 2: Remove the nursery wallpaper before dusk.
RULE 3: If you hear crying from under the floorboards, leave.
Immediately.

I followed them.
Mostly.

I slipped.
Glanced at a mirror by the front door ‚Äî just for a second.

Saw something that wasn‚Äôt me.
It had my face, but the smile wasn‚Äôt mine. The teeth weren‚Äôt human.

I covered it with a blanket and kept working.
Didn‚Äôt sleep for three days after that.

But I got the job done.
Place was gone by morning.
Just dirt and fog where the cabin used to be.

‚∏ª

Sometimes it‚Äôs worse.
Sometimes they send me to places where the walls breathe.

Where clocks run backward.
Where the wind whispers in dead languages.

Last year, there was a site ‚Äî I can‚Äôt say where ‚Äî that required me to burn down a hotel that didn‚Äôt technically exist.

The Black Book said:

‚ÄúEach room you enter will add another memory you never had. Burn it before you forget who you are.‚Äù

Took me five hours.
By the time I lit the final match, I was almost convinced I had a wife named Clara and a baby girl named June.
I don‚Äôt.

I double-checked.

I think.

‚∏ª

The worst job I ever had?

A basement in Kansas.
Concrete walls. Chains.
Blood thick as syrup on the floor.

Nothing in the Black Book but one sentence:

‚ÄúIt is still hungry. Do not feed it anything you love.‚Äù

I almost failed that one.
Dropped my wallet without noticing.
Had a photo of my sister in it.

I left the house shaking.
When I checked my wallet in the car, the photo was gone.
In its place was a scrap of flesh.

Still beating.

‚∏ª

Some days I wonder who they are ‚Äî the ones who leave the book.
The ones who know where the horrors are.
The ones who created the rules.

Are they protecting us?
Or just covering their tracks?

Am I the good guy in all this?
Or just another cog in a much darker machine?

I try not to ask.
The Black Book doesn‚Äôt like it when you ask.
I tried once ‚Äî left a note inside:

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

Next morning, I woke up with my own handwriting carved into my arm.

‚ÄúCleaner, clean thyself.‚Äù

I bled for hours.

‚∏ª

So why am I telling you this now?

Because this morning, for the first time in over a decade‚Ä¶
The Black Book didn‚Äôt show up.

Instead, there was an envelope.

My name written in red.
No return address.
Inside ‚Äî a photo.

Of me.
Sleeping.

And on the back, just one rule:

‚ÄúDo not run. We already know where you‚Äôll go.‚Äù

‚∏ª

I have a very special job.
But I think I just became the next mess to clean up.

And I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs coming to save me.",2,1754510835.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and appeal of bourbon pecan coffee depend on several key factors. These features directly influence the aroma, flavor, and overall drinking experience. This section will delve into the crucial aspects that differentiate the best offerings in the market.

**Coffee Bean Origin:** The origin of the coffee beans substantially impacts the final flavor profile. Beans sourced from regions known for producing high-quality coffee, such as Ethiopia, Colombia, and Brazil, frequently enough result in a more complex and nuanced flavor.

Coffee beans from Ethiopia are known for their shining acidity and floral notes, while Colombian beans offer a balanced profile with hints of caramel and chocolate. Brazilian beans tend to be nutty and sweet, providing a solid base for the bourbon pecan flavor. The best bourbon pecan coffees often utilize a blend of beans from different origins to achieve a well-rounded and harmonious taste.

**Roast Level:** The roast level plays a crucial role in determining the bitterness and body of the coffee. Lighter roasts tend to be more acidic and preserve the original characteristics of the beans,while darker roasts develop a bolder,more roasted flavor with less acidity.

A medium roast is generally preferred for bourbon pecan coffee, as it strikes a balance between acidity and body, allowing the pecan and bourbon flavors to shine through without being overshadowed by bitterness. This roast level also helps to enhance the coffee's natural sweetness, complementing the overall flavor profile.

**Flavoring Method:** The method used to impart the bourbon and pecan flavors can significantly impact the quality of the coffee. Natural flavorings derived from real pecans and genuine bourbon extracts are preferred over artificial flavors, as they tend to deliver a more authentic and nuanced taste.

Some roasters use a process called ""barrel aging,"" where coffee beans are aged in used bourbon barrels to infuse them with the spirit's flavor. This technique can add depth and complexity to the coffee, but it is often more expensive then using extracts.

**Aroma Intensity:** The aroma of bourbon pecan coffee is crucial to the overall sensory experience. A well-balanced aroma should feature discernible notes of roasted pecans,a hint of bourbon,and the underlying scent of fresh coffee.

A strong, inviting aroma can enhance the anticipation of the first sip, while a weak or artificial-smelling aroma can be a sign of lower-quality flavorings. The best bourbon pecan coffees will have a captivating aroma that sets them apart from the competition.

**Pecan Source and Quality:** The source and quality of the pecans used in the flavoring process are critical. Some brands source pecans from specific regions known for their superior flavor,such as Georgia or Texas.

High-quality pecans tend to have a richer, more buttery flavor that complements the bourbon notes well. lower-quality pecans may taste bland or even slightly rancid, which can detract from the overall experience.The best bourbon pecan coffees will clearly indicate the source and quality of their pecans.

**Bourbon Flavor Type:** The specific type of bourbon flavor used in the coffee can vary from brand to brand. Some coffees use flavorings that mimic the taste of classic Kentucky bourbon, while others may be inspired by sweeter, smoother varieties.

The character of the bourbon flavor can significantly impact the overall impression of the coffee. A well-chosen bourbon flavor will add depth and complexity without overpowering the other flavors. It should be smooth and warming, with subtle notes of vanilla, caramel, and oak.

I just tried the Upward Peach Nectarine Drink powered by Trulieve, and it honestly surprised me. I don't usually do energy drinks, but this one is getting bought again for sure. Got it delivered in just a few days, right to my doorstep by ordering from their website (drinkonward.com). The can looks really clean and sleek, definitely stands out to any other energy drink. The flavor is super smooth, like a light fruity soda without being too sweet or fake tasting. It's got 5mg THC and 5mg CBD, and the combo hit just right. I started feeling it in about 20-30 minutes, chill but still focused. It gave me energy without the crash or jittery effects that coffee sometimes has. I felt productive, relaxed, and in a good mood the whole time. It's perfect for daytime activities like running errands or cleaning the house. One of the best THC-infused drinks I've tried in a long time. I'll definitely be ordering more than one case next time.¬†

This is because the conversation is very structured and with a clear end goal in mind.

I can technically make small talk, but it's basic stuff like *""Hello"", ""How's it's going?"" and ""See you later""*.

While at the bar with my friends, I can easily make conversation with men, but never with women. The reason for this is because I've spent my entire life around men, I'm therefore used to it.

To put it very simply and non-bullshit, my self-esteem is incredibly low due to no past success (2 ONS, but I got really lucky). Whenever I try to talk to a women, my mind goes blank and I've also had anxiety attacks in the past while in the middle of a ""conversation"".

I know I'll probably get downvoted for this post (this is Reddit after all), but as a single man in his late 20's, I would ofcouse like to date. Oddly enough, I've received a lot of negative comments for posts similar to this one, I don't know why?

A good example of my lack of social skills is that I don't talk to the women in the coffee shop when I'm the only customer, due to being scared and nervous. I also hid in the restroom the first couple of times.

Is it even possible for someone like myself to improve, after 10 years of negative self talk? If so, how?

I‚Äôm a banker. I met a barista, Maria, who works at the cafe in my office building, which is exclusive to my firm. In the first week of our meeting, I visited the cafe three mornings in a row as usual, ordered my coffee, and proceeded to work as usual. On the third visit, Maria began to be more friendly and memorized my order, as is typical with regular customers.

The following week, I saw Maria at the service elevator. I said,

- ‚ÄúMaria, right?‚Äù Maria responds with, ‚ÄúYes, what‚Äôs your name?‚ÄùI remembered I never introduced myself to Maria in our earlier interactions) tells her my first and last name. Maria follows up with  asking how I spell my last name since there are multiple ways to spell it. I commented on Maria‚Äôs double espresso shot she had in her hand, and Maria says she drinks the coffee from a different cafe in the building (not the one she works at) because she likes the flavor profile more. I laughed and walked away. 

The second week, I had to come in the office early, and Maria is working with another person. While Maria is ringing up my order, I asked ‚Äúhow is your week going?‚Äù And Maria responds with ‚Äúgood, it‚Äôs been busy! How‚Äôs yours‚Äù. I jokingly say the week has been tough because I had been traveling the last couple of days. Maria asks ‚Äúwhere have you been traveling‚Äù, and I reply ‚ÄúI was in XYZ for a couple days for work. It feels like it should be Friday.‚Äù Maria says ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been to XYZ‚Äù and I respond with a laugh and say ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not missing much.‚Äù Maria then says she is a streamer and chats with all kinds of people over  the world, but she hasn‚Äôt traveled much‚Äù. I playfully respond with ‚ÄúOh really? I never really understood streaming, are you playing games or something else?‚Äù Maria responds with a laugh and says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what most people think, but I am just talking to people so it‚Äôs fun.‚Äù

I returned to the cafe with a colleague a couple hours later to get a second coffee for the day. The other worker takes my order, and Maria seemingly jumps up from her seat to ring me up. I jokingly tell her I needed a second coffee for the day and not to judge me, and Maria responds with a laugh and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had two coffees today too! I am not judging you!‚Äù I moved to the pickup line and walked away as another customer comes up to the counter.

1mjf28k,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1mjf28k/why_are_users_raving_about_the_best_blender_magic/,Why Are Users Raving About the Best Blender Magic Bullet MBR-1101,"The Magic Bullet MBR-1101 blender has been a surprising addition to my kitchen arsenal. From the very beginning, I was intrigued by its compact size and the promise of accomplishing a multitude of tasks quickly. After using it daily for several weeks, I can confidently say that it's a versatile gadget, though not without some limitations. As someone who enjoys a mix of quick meal prep and experimenting with smoothies, sauces, and homemade recipes, this blender presented itself as a handy companion.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right off the bat, I noticed how compact and lightweight the design is. Measuring only 4.5 inches deep and 4 inches wide, with a height of 11.8 inches, it barely takes up counter space. The silver-and-black color combo fits into the aesthetic of my kitchen, and its design emphasizes functionality. Everything included‚Äîthe cups, motor base, and cross-blade‚Äîfeels sturdy for its size, though it‚Äôs clearly built more for convenience than heavy-duty tasks. The high-impact plastic of the cups doesn‚Äôt feel fragile, but it‚Äôs not premium by any means, which might matter to anyone seeking a long-term, indestructible appliance.  

As a bonus, having two different cup sizes (tall and short) as well as a party mug is surprisingly useful. It cuts down on extra dishes cluttering my sink since I can blend and drink from the same container. Oh, and how could I forget the resealable and to-go lid options included? Those came in handy when I prepared smoothies to take on the go or stored leftover dip.

**Performance and Features**  
What really caught my attention was the 250-watt motor. At first, I wasn‚Äôt convinced such compact power could deliver results, but here‚Äôs where Magic Bullet pleasantly surprised me. Whether it‚Äôs whipping up omelets, creating creamy smoothies, or grinding coffee beans, this blender handles it pretty well. However, for tougher items like frozen fruit or ice cubes, it struggles unless you add some liquid (half a cup of water or milk usually does the trick). 

The 10-second promise isn‚Äôt an exaggeration if you‚Äôre doing simpler tasks like mixing pancake batter or blending soft fruits. One feature that makes it a winner is its versatility‚Äîit chops, blends, grinds, and even whips. I‚Äôve tried my hand at making salsas, hummus, and even guacamole. Having six speed settings feels slightly unnecessary for this machine since the push-button controls are so intuitive, but it‚Äôs nice to have options if needed.

[Check Magic Bullet MBR-1101 price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b012t634sm/)  

**Strengths**  
- Super compact and lightweight, making it perfect for small apartments or kitchens.  
- Its ability to mix, whip, chop, and grind makes meal and snack prep ridiculously easy.  
- Cleaning is a breeze, thanks to dishwasher-safe components.  
- Includes multiple cup sizes and lids for different purposes.  
- Recipe book included for those short on ideas!  

**Critiques**  
- The 250-watt motor shows its limits with tougher tasks like blending frozen fruit or large ice cubes.  
- High-impact plastic cups feel durable enough but may deteriorate over time.  
- Bullet-shaped design isn‚Äôt always compatible with blending larger quantities.  
- Noise levels are on the higher side when mixing thicker consistencies.  

**Target User**  
If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs short on counter space but still values kitchen efficiency, this product could be a gem for you. College students, young professionals, or small families will likely benefit the most. However, if you‚Äôre into heavy blending (like daily frozen smoothies or high-demand meal prep), it might be worth considering something with greater power.

**Other Options**  
Comparing it to peer products like the NutriBullet or Oster Classic Blender, there are some obvious trade-offs. NutriBullet‚Äôs stronger motor is better for tough jobs, while the Oster offers larger capacity options. However, neither competitor matches the Magic Bullet in terms of portability and how minimal the setup is. For someone looking for a simple, straightforward appliance, this product carves out a niche. On the flip side, heavy users may lean toward models with more robust motors, even if that means sacrificing the cute compactness this blender offers.

**Quality for Price**  
The affordability of this blender is a significant selling point. It delivers solid performance at a price that‚Äôs friendly to anyone on a budget. While it may not entirely replace a large countertop blender, it justifies its cost with its convenience. Much of the value lies in its all-in-one design. Yes, it has limitations, but for what you pay, it‚Äôs a steal. A little investment for a big impact on your kitchen routine? I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs worth exploring.

i'm sitting here, newly conscious, drinking coffee and waiting until its time to go work my final night shift of the week (3/3 in a row).  

the past few weeks i got spoiled.  i had great patients, i had hospitalists that were great to work with, very few admits during my shifts, and great handoffs to my coworkers in the morning. 

but, as we all know, we each take turns eating the shit sandwich of this job, and now its my turn. 

the hospitalist is a jerk, which is a shame because our usual night people are pretty chill. talking to the guy is like pulling teeth to get him to do anything.

there's some significant unit drama going on, which i am not a part of, so for the past two nights i've hid in one of our cubby nursing stations alone for my shift, just keeping my nose down and getting stuff done.  it sucks because i really like my coworkers, and don't want to be antisocial, but any time i got close to the main nursing station i could hear them carrying on about stuff.  no thanks, i'll go back to hiding now. 

due to that unit drama, we've been shortstaffed.  just a couple weeks ago we had 4:1 on nights... now 7:1 is a looming possibility. i'm hoping some kind of coverage is found for tonight. 

every day i've had an admit at shift change, then at least two more throughout the night.  

i'm in a weird trend where everyone either has a heparin drip, or a gaping leg wound due to lifestyle choices.  the people with the leg wounds are militant in their stupidity. last night i admitted a guy around 0430 who was pissy because i asked him to disrobe. he refused and threatened AMA if i mentioned it again.  his toe probably would have fallen off by the time he made it out to the bus station, so i let it go and documented it and passed it on in the morning.  

i've felt like i've been so run down that my AM reports are shit, and i feel like i've said ""i don't know"" during report more times this week than i have in weeks past combined. 

there's plenty of other stuff that falls into the category of ""chronically annoying"" that compounds all of the above- usually not a big deal but when combined with everything else just gives the night a shit flavor. 

but, in 12 more hours i'll be done for the week and get a couple days away from the madhouse. 

has it been worse? yes.  man those few weeks of easygoing patient care were great though, and while i didn't take them for granted, it's sad to see them gone.  but as a wiser fella than myself once said: sometimes you eat the b'ar, and sometimes, well, the b'ar eats you.

I work in a public hospital in New Zealand and as a newish type 2 I‚Äôve been doing all the research I can to try manage myself and I‚Äôve got my a1c down into a pretty good range, when I started it was 11.5, latest reading 5.7 so I think I‚Äôm on the right track despite the fact I still haven‚Äôt managed to see a diabetes nurse educator or dietician or psych or endo or anything of actual use. I‚Äôd been trying to push to get in to see at least a dietician just to get some extra help, but I think that ends today. 

I‚Äôm a cardiac sonographer and was asked to scan a known difficult and violent patient which is part of the job so no drama, and when I got there the cafeteria staff member who brings the menus to the patients to choose their food for the week was too nervous to go in so she asked me to deliver it, which wasn‚Äôt a problem. I had a look and it was the ‚Äúdiabetic‚Äù menu so I looked even closer - the first dinner option was Mac n cheese or lasagne, final option tray of sandwiches, for breakfast it was porridge or cornflakes or toast, lunch was potato bake, risotto or tomato soup and toast‚Ä¶

As I said, I‚Äôm very new to this but is this not one big spike on a plate? And where are the vegetables? The patient was complaining that the food is rubbish and his sugars are off and no one is listening to him and I don‚Äôt blame him in the slightest.

And then the same day the coffee cart lady told us the dieticians are taking away the hot chocolate marshmallows which I don‚Äôt eat anyway but if a paying adult wants to have them I don‚Äôt see an issue, especially when the same place has pies and sausage rolls and potato wedges and cakes and muffins and monster energy drinks and juices, but we aren‚Äôt allowed full sugar coke or marshmallows? What a joke. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm not pushing to see a dietician at my hospital anymore, either everything I‚Äôve read is wrong or they are completely clueless

Version¬†1.1.1¬†is now available. It doesn‚Äôt do anything magical, but it¬†does¬†work more consistently‚Äîand asks for admin rights like a normal grown-up script.

# What‚Äôs changed?

* Adds¬†UAC elevation¬†prompt so you don‚Äôt have to remember to ‚ÄúRun as Admin‚Äù
* Improved logging: older logs are archived, not obliterated
* More resilient error handling¬†(because ASUS software isn‚Äôt)
* Services are now disabled with¬†multiple retries¬†before we give up in exhaustion
* No more overwriting kill logs¬†unless you¬†really¬†want them gone
* A few tweaks to¬†catch edge cases¬†so you don‚Äôt have to

# Why now?

Someone said the old version didn‚Äôt run right. So here we are.  
v1.1.1 isn‚Äôt revolutionary‚Äîit just doesn‚Äôt fall over as easily. Good enough.

# Install (or don‚Äôt, whatever)

* Clone the repo
* Run¬†Register-ReaperTask.ps1¬†in an elevated PowerShell
* Reboot. ASUS won‚Äôt.

# New Stuff

(Because someone said it's a good idea)

* New¬†[CHANGELOG.md](http://changelog.md/)¬†and¬†[RELEASENOTES.md](http://releasenotes.md/)¬†because we pretend to be organized now
* CVE references updated, credit given where due

These coffee makers feature a large water reservoir that can hold enough water to brew a full 30 cups. The water level is frequently enough indicated by clear markings on the reservoir, allowing you to easily see how much water is needed.The brewing process is optimized to extract the maximum flavor from the coffee grounds while maintaining a consistent temperature throughout the brewing cycle.

**dual-wall Insulation:** Many of the best 30-cup coffee makers utilize dual-wall insulation to maintain the coffee's temperature for extended periods. This feature eliminates the need for a hot plate, which can often scorch the coffee and alter its taste.

The dual-wall insulation works by creating a vacuum between the inner and outer walls of the coffee maker. This vacuum prevents heat from escaping, keeping the coffee hot for hours without requiring any additional heating elements. This not only preserves the coffee's flavor but also saves energy by reducing the need for constant reheating.

**Programmable Timer:** A programmable timer allows you to set the coffee maker to automatically brew coffee at a specific time. This feature is particularly useful for those who wont to wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee or have coffee ready for an early morning meeting.

The programmable timer is typically accessed thru a digital interface on the coffee maker. You can set the desired brew time, and the coffee maker will automatically initiate the brewing process at the set time. Some models also offer additional programming options, such as the ability to set different brew times for different days of the week.

**One-Hand Dispensing:** The inclusion of a one-hand dispensing system makes serving coffee quick and easy, especially in busy environments. This feature is designed to minimize spills and allow users to fill their cups without needing to hold the coffee maker.

the one-hand dispensing system usually consists of a lever or button that, when pressed, releases coffee from the coffee maker. The design ensures a smooth and steady pour, preventing drips and spills. This feature is particularly useful for self-serve situations, such as office break rooms or conference settings.

**Safety Features:** Modern 30-cup coffee makers incorporate several safety features to prevent accidents and ensure safe operation. These features include automatic shut-off, scald protection, and secure locking mechanisms.

Automatic shut-off turns off the coffee maker after a certain period of inactivity, preventing overheating and conserving energy. Scald protection features, such as insulated handles and non-drip spouts, minimize the risk of burns. Secure locking mechanisms ensure that the coffee maker remains stable during operation, preventing accidental spills and tipping.

Key features of the 30-cup coffee makers include:

 High-capacity brewing
 Dual-wall insulation
 Programmable timer
 One-hand dispensing

## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality 30-cup coffee maker offers numerous benefits, from enhanced convenience and efficiency to significant cost savings in the long run. Let's examine the core advantages of using one of these coffee makers.

**Increased Efficiency:** A 30-cup coffee maker allows you to brew a large quantity of coffee in a single batch, saving time and effort compared to brewing multiple smaller pots. This is especially beneficial in settings where a continuous supply of coffee is needed.

Instead of repeatedly brewing smaller batches, a 30-cup coffee maker allows you to prepare a large amount of coffee at once, reducing the overall brewing time. This is particularly useful during meetings, events, or in busy office environments where employees frequently need coffee. By minimizing the time spent brewing coffee,you can focus on othre tasks and improve overall productivity.

**Enhanced Convenience:** Features like programmable timers and one-hand dispensing add a layer of convenience to the coffee-making process. These features simplify the operation of the coffee maker and make it easier to serve and enjoy coffee.

With a programmable timer, you can set the coffee maker to automatically brew coffee at your desired time, ensuring that a fresh pot is ready when you need it. The one-hand dispensing system allows you to easily fill your cup with coffee without needing to handle the coffee maker, reducing the risk of spills and making the process more efficient.

**Cost Savings:** While the initial investment in a 30-cup coffee maker may be higher than that of a smaller model, it can save you money in the long run by reducing the amount of coffee wasted. Brewing larger batches can also be more economical than using single-serve coffee makers or purchasing coffee from coffee shops.

By brewing a large batch of coffee, you can precisely control the amount of coffee you need, minimizing waste.This is especially beneficial in environments where coffee consumption fluctuates, as you can avoid brewing more coffee than is actually needed. Additionally, brewing your own coffee is typically more cost-effective than buying coffee from coffee shops or using single-serve coffee makers, which often have higher per-cup costs.

**Consistent Quality:** High-quality 30-cup coffee makers are designed to maintain a consistent temperature throughout the brewing process, ensuring that each cup of coffee tastes the same. This consistency is especially critically important in settings where coffee is being served to a large group, as it ensures that everyone enjoys a satisfying cup of coffee.

These coffee makers utilize advanced brewing technology to regulate the water temperature and extraction time, resulting in a consistent and flavorful cup of coffee every time. The dual-wall insulation also helps maintain the coffee's temperature after brewing, preserving its taste and aroma for longer periods.## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about 30-cup coffee makers to address common concerns and provide additional clarity.

**How easy is it to clean a 30-cup coffee maker?**
Cleaning a 30-cup coffee maker is generally straightforward, especially with models that feature removable parts. Many models have dishwasher-safe components, such as the filter basket and coffee reservoir, which simplifies the cleaning process.

Regular descaling is also critically important to maintain the coffee maker's performance. Descaling involves removing mineral buildup from the water reservoir and heating elements, which can affect the taste of the coffee and the overall efficiency of the machine. Most manufacturers recommend descaling every 1-3 months, depending on water hardness.

**Can I use pre-ground coffee or do I need to use freshly ground beans?**
You can use both pre-ground coffee and freshly ground beans with most 30-cup coffee makers. However, using freshly ground beans is generally recommended for the best flavor.

Freshly ground beans retain more of their essential oils and aromas, resulting in a richer and more flavorful cup of coffee. if you choose to use pre-ground coffee, be sure to store it in an airtight container to maintain its freshness.

**What type of filter does a 30-cup coffee maker use?**
30-cup coffee makers typically use either paper filters or permanent, reusable filters. Paper filters are disposable and offer excellent filtration, while permanent filters are made of mesh or stainless steel and can be washed and reused.

Permanent filters are more environmentally friendly and can save you money in the long run, as you don't need to purchase replacement filters. However, they may not filter out as much sediment as paper filters, resulting in a slightly less clean cup of coffee.

**How long does it take to brew a full 30 cups of coffee?**
The brewing time for a 30-cup coffee maker can vary depending on the model and the strength of the desired coffee. On average, it takes between 20 and 30 minutes to brew a full 30 cups of coffee.

Some models offer a ""fast brew"" option, which can significantly reduce the brewing time without sacrificing flavor. However,it's important to note that brewing time can also be affected by the water quality and the amount of coffee grounds used.

So I‚Äôm doing contract work on the side for a non profit. I go to meet with my boss at a coffee shop. She was on vacation for a week.

Anyway, a few weeks ago I asked for her referral for an apartment I was trying to obtain. It was a last minute thing because my main employer is on vacation. The landlady wanted an employers referral. She texted me at the time that she would‚Äôve appreciated a heads up. Still she gave me the reference.

So today she asks me if I got the apartment and then I just went straight to venting about my roommate and how she‚Äôs such a nightmare to live with lol. It was unintentional but I was really sitting in front of this cadaan lady disclosing personal info and I just felt the ick. 

She‚Äôs a cool cadaan though and very cultured. But I feel like she may have been a bit uncomfortable afterward. I apologized when she got back from the restroom because I never get overly personal with her. 

Do you think that was weird? I‚Äôm worried she will think of me as unstable and unreliable lol. What do y‚Äôall think? ",1,1754510092.0,Somalia,3,1.0,False

This is because the conversation is very structured and with a clear end goal in mind.

I can technically make small talk, but it's basic stuff like *""Hello"", ""How's it's going?"" and ""See you later""*.

While at the bar with my friends, I can easily make conversation with men, but never with women. The reason for this is because I've spent my entire life around men, I'm therefore used to it.

To put it very simply and non-bullshit, my self-esteem is incredibly low due to no past success (2 ONS, but I got really lucky). Whenever I try to talk to a women, my mind goes blank and I've also had anxiety attacks in the past while in the middle of a ""conversation"".

I know I'll probably get downvoted for this post (this is Reddit after all), but as a single man in his late 20's, I would ofcouse like to date. Oddly enough, I've received a lot of negative comments for posts similar to this one, I don't know why?

A good example of my lack of social skills is that I don't talk to the women in the coffee shop when I'm the only customer, due to being scared and nervous. I also hid in the restroom the first couple of times.

Is it even possible for someone like myself to improve, after 10 years of negative self talk? If so, how?

We're now NC (two years for me and 1.5 ywars for DH) with MIL after she treated me like an incubator after my traumatic first birth. Her and DH were very emeshed. She is controlling, judgmental, impossible to please and throws tantrums. 

We've had a second baby that we didn't tell MIL about. She found out from a cousin of DH's. When she found out she messaged Just No Step Mom asking her if she could tell her how ""her son and his family are doing because she's sick with worry"" and asked her to respond ""if she could"". She also randomly ran into one of DH's acquaintances from high school at the bank he works at and asked to meet for coffee. She also started messaging DH's best friend pretending we aren''t NC asking to meet with him and catch up with his kids and asking about us. Previous to this attempts she's sent texts and phone calls to both of us, dropped off presents at our house, showed up a couple of times until DH talked to his parents, taped a letter to our door, called DH's work client line, threatened to show up at his office, and sent emails to his personal and professional email.

Just No Step Mom has always been a gossip and busy body. I try to talk to her as little as possible. Prior to our following out she going out to lunch and coffee with MIL. It was a weird friendship. They both pretended it was the other person reaching out. Step Mom claims MIL would try to talk about us and she'd shut it down. Step Mom initially was saying that it was going to be her role to keep communication open between us and claimed that MIL really heard DH concerns and had been depressed a long time but was going to therapy.  MIL has always claimed to us that she has done nothing wrong and doesn't and know why we're NC or why we're upset (has been explained).  Step Mom claims that MIL has now forgotten what she did wrong because of the trauma of NC.

My Dad told Step Mom to stop being in the middle and she has stopped communicating with her (sending pictures and updates of our Lap). However, she always defends MIL. She says it's not about taking sides but she can understand where MIL is coming from. She defended her contacting DH's friends and said at this stage you would do the things she is, because you'd just be desperate. I said I wouldn't do that because I don't think it helps the situation at all and is crossing a boundary. Step Mom said well she could just park on your street and watch you to see the new baby because she would eventually since we go on a lot walks and she's not doing that. Like thanks not stalking us isn't an achievement.",11,1754509950.0,JUSTNOMIL,4,1.0,False

I ordered samples of Yum Boujee Marshmallow, Yum Pistachio Gelato, and Eden Juicy Apple from Microperfumes. They arrived yesterday and I tested out my samples multiple times to get my opinion on them. Here's what I think of all 3, from my most favorite to least favorite:

Eden Juicy Apple: I love the scent of apples, and I think I finally found the apple perfume I was looking for. It really does smell like a juicy, delicious apple with some ripe berries mixed in. As it dries down, I can smell some florals in the background, but the perfume remains fruity, like a delicious fruit punch almost. I'd buy a full sized bottle of it. 

Yum Pistachio Gelato: This one was actually the most interesting to me. When I first applied it, I was trying to figure out where the pistachio ice cream was at. I just couldn't smell it. In fact, I couldn't figure out what it's supposed to smell like. It wasn't bad, but it's not what I thought it would be. However, after drinking some hot coffee and beginning to feel a little hot, I decided to smell my wrist again and here it was: I finally got a whiff of pistacio flavored ice cream. It was only lightly sweet, but the pistacio ice cream finally shone through. It smelled very lovely at that moment, so I think this fragrance only comes through when it's hot. I'd only wear this one during the hottest times of the year when I know I'm going to sweat a little. 

Yum Boujee Marshmallow: To the die hard fans of that one, I'm sorry, but I have mixed feelings about it. In the opening, it really does smell like a strawberry milkshake topped with marshmallows, but as it dried down, it was starting to smell more musky, like a creamy strawberry musk. It's not bad, but it's not something I'd want as a perfume. Ever like the smell of a perfume, but you'd rather have it as a candle or a shower gel? That's how I feel about that one. It's just not my thing, but if someone gifted me that one, I'd wear it every now and then. It's decent, but I don't love it. 

I'm aware that perfumes will smell different on every individual, but those were my experiences with them. ",3,1754509866.0,FemFragLab,1,1.0,False
1mjeqpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/norfolk/comments/1mjeqpq/norfolk_dry_bottle_shop_expanding_to_a_bar_lounge/,"Norfolk dry bottle shop expanding to a bar, lounge and restaurant","What began as a test for a dry bar is growing into a full nonalcoholic cocktail lounge in Norfolk.

[Ceremony](https://enjoyceremony.com/), a dry bottle shop, operated a pop-up nonalcoholic bar for three months at Vessel Craft Coffee in the Chelsea District about two years ago. This learning experience gave owner Chris Simmonds proof that his goal of expanding the business was within reach.

His landlord, at the business‚Äô permanent building on Shirley Avenue, encouraged him to move to a larger space to take on the endeavor, and she had a spot in mind.

On June 1, Ceremony relocated around the corner to the former Eleanor‚Äôs Norfolk spot at Baldwin and Colley avenues. It has about three times the space and allows customers to enjoy drinks on-site, Simmonds said.

The spacious lounge area has tables and chairs for customers who want to sit and sip on cold beverages such as nonalcoholic beers, wines and pre-made mocktails. They can also borrow games to play with friends, get work done using the Wi-Fi and attend tastings and special events such as jazz night.

The space, which was once an old house, also accommodates Simmonds‚Äô other business, Less Than, a zero-waste refill shop offering goods such as dish soap, toothpaste tablets and laundry detergent.

1mjeppq,https://www.reddit.com/r/martialarts/comments/1mjeppq/was_my_dojo_a_cult_its_long/,Was my Dojo a cult? (It‚Äôs long),"In a very short summary: I joined this academy to learn JKD. I did some research and saw that it was accredited. They told me that in order to learn JKD, I also had to take other classes they offered as part of a package deal for the same price. These included traditional Kung Fu, Tai Chi, and Sanda. I agreed and paid the registration fee, which included a uniform and training shoes.

The system there is hierarchical. There‚Äôs the grandmaster, sifus, and so on. Time passed, and I received my first belt. A few months later, two sifus quit due to poor pay. They worked at the dojo teaching over four classes a day for around $150 USD a month. I had to take my first test, and they told me I had to pay $60 USD for the exam and also buy a patch, which was mandatory for testing and cost $10 USD.

Time went on, and other students were promoted to sifus. They began teaching classes, and the grandmaster only showed up for the second half of the sessions. Then came a JKD test. I was told I needed a specific shirt to take the exam, which cost $40 USD, and also MMA-style gloves that I had to buy from the academy, costing another $40 USD, plus the exam fee of $60 USD.

Six months later, I had to take another Kung Fu test: another $60 USD plus boards to break, which cost $10 USD each. Six more months passed, and the cycle repeated ‚Äî each time requiring more boards.

A select group of students was invited to join a ‚Äúsecret clan‚Äù with different techniques. This cost $150 USD per year (they gifted you the mandatory patches). Any training or protective gear had to be bought from the academy. The training shoes would break within four months. After the second time I had to replace them, I told the trainer I wouldn‚Äôt keep spending $40 USD every 3‚Äì4 months on new shoes. He agreed and said he would talk to their distributor.

At one point, I was spending over $100 USD just for testing and breaking boards. I started feeling like everything was just a way to get money from me. I mentioned it to a few classmates, and they said they didn‚Äôt see it that way and were happy with everything.

The grandmaster was always very ‚Äúspiritual,‚Äù constantly giving sermons about reflection and introspection. But he was the kind of man who knew how to find the vulnerable spot in your self-confidence and manipulate you. One female student was extremely loyal and devoted to him, to the point where she would arrive before him to prepare his coffee, greet him when he arrived, and see him off with a hug and kiss on the cheek when he left. (This student had a clear father figure void.) She ended up working for him for free for many years. There was even a mother of one of my classmates who said the grandmaster was like Jesus Christ.

When I told another student that I was starting to dislike the classes because everything revolved around paying money and having to buy things to move up in rank, everything started to change. The instructors stopped giving me the attention they used to. I ‚Äúfailed‚Äù the same test twice, even though I performed better than many others. One instructor even sparred with me ‚Äî I was about to beat him when he used a submission hold that we hadn‚Äôt been taught yet (a well-known BJJ ankle lock that can easily break your ankle if you don‚Äôt tap out).

All of these things led me to leave the academy. I started noticing how strange my classmates‚Äô attitudes were ‚Äî they saw the constant fees as completely normal and disagreed with me finding them odd or wrong, even to the point of reporting me to the grandmaster. The sifus stopped giving me proper instruction, even though I was about to take exams. They overworked me to the point that I got injured before one of the tests (something I forgot to mention earlier).

1mjepgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1mjepgz/first_time_pregnancy_and_planning_on_aborting/,First time pregnancy and planning on aborting,"I‚Äôm F20 and my bf is M21. We‚Äôve been together almost 4 years now. I‚Äôm 10 weeks 6 days, just had my ultrasound yesterday. Me and my bf both agreed when we found out that abortion is our only option. Seeing it on the screen made it all feel too real. My bf and mom went with me to the ultrasound and my bf referred to it as ‚Äúhe‚Äù the entire time which threw me off. My bf has made it very VERY clear throughout our relationship that he never ever wants kids. I‚Äôd only want a kid if we could afford it (ie. Already have a house and vehicles, we each have a car but live in a crappy trailer that‚Äôs falling apart with his mom and brother). I live in Texas so we are planning on going to Colorado for the abortion. I guess I‚Äôm just posting this because I‚Äôm scared and don‚Äôt have any friends to talk to. Me and my bfs relationship isn‚Äôt great, when he‚Äôs angry he says things to hurt me on purpose. It used to be worse when we first started dating but after several talks he‚Äôs gotten better. Like I said we had the ultrasound yesterday and once we got home the only thing he cared about was hooking up his new power supply to his pc trying to fix it. I was still reeling with the shock of seeing our child for the first time and knowing that would also be the last. Turns out his mother board was the issue. At first I was trying to help him with his pc but I couldn‚Äôt get my mind off the ultrasound and eventually just curled up on the one corner of the bed that wasn‚Äôt covered in laundry or pc parts and started crying quietly. He never checked on me, just kept cussing at his pc and slamming drawers and kicking stuff. The only thing he said to me was ‚Äúso when are you going to get a job‚Äù. I‚Äôve been working 2 jobs, babysitting my niece 12 hours a day ($200+ every 2 weeks)and rescue dog transport every other weekend (would be $800+ every trip but I‚Äôm paying off my bfs truck and that‚Äôs $500, weeks bought the truck from my mom and I drive transport for her business so she just keeps the $500, so I was only making $300+ each trip). My morning sickness has been so bad that I‚Äôm bedridden most days and can‚Äôt be on my feet for more than a few minutes without getting the urge to throw up so I haven‚Äôt been able to work the past few weeks. He always uses that as a way to put me down when he‚Äôs upset. I didn‚Äôt respond, just laid there a little longer until he stepped out of the room, then got up and went to the bathroom to clean off my face. After calming down in the bathroom I went back into the room, folded the laundry, put my papers from the Dr in my purse, grabbed the ultrasound and went outside to give myself space away from him so I could freely look over the ultrasound and feel all the feelings. After sitting out there for 20mins he came out to join me and brought our smoke bag (weed). I set up the bong and he just kinda acted as if nothing had happened, as if it was just another normal day. I‚Äôve been so tired lately, I‚Äôm sick all the time so my energy is drained all the time so I just didn‚Äôt have the energy to have one of those conversations with him. He hasn‚Äôt talked with me about the pregnancy at all except telling me it‚Äôs probably too late to get an abortion and that I need to hurry up and get this over with. Most days he doesn‚Äôt show much support and continues to ask me to do things for him (run into town to get him food, run down the street to get his favorite coffee) but sometimes he seems to care. He‚Äôll get me something from the kitchen (usually fruit as that‚Äôs been the only thing I can keep down) or just hold me and be sweet. I‚Äôm so confused and feel so lost, I‚Äôd leave him if I could but I have only $2000 in savings which is barely 1 months rent in our area and my oldest sister just had a baby a little over a year ago and is living with our mom. Me and my bfs also have 3 cats and agreed when we took them in that if we ever split the 2 girls are mine and the boy is his (one of the girls doesn‚Äôt like my bf as he doesn‚Äôt respect her personal space at all, the other girl just prefers me). The only places I could go is my grandparents but my grandma‚Äôs allergies are too severe for me to bring my cats or my dads but he lives an hour away in the city which would make going back to work for my sister and mom difficult but I‚Äôd at least get to take my cats with me. Right now my plan is to get the abortion and stay with my bf while I continue to save until I‚Äôm able to move out on my own and leave him. I haven‚Äôt talked to my family about our relationship issues at all since they are quite protective and I fear that if me and my bf work things out that they‚Äôll continue to hate him forever. I just feel so lost and scared.",1,1754509770.0,abortion,2,1.0,False

I started this journey on February 8 at 260 lbs (118 kg / 18.5 stone). Today, August 6, I weigh 175 lbs (79 kg / 12.5 stone). My goal is 125 lbs (56.7 kg / 8.9 stone), and while I‚Äôm not there yet, I‚Äôve lost a lot over the past six months without surgery, without a gym, and without a perfect plan.

I didn‚Äôt weigh in every day or even every week. There were times I didn‚Äôt have access to a scale at all. But when I did, here‚Äôs what I recorded: February 8 ‚Äì 260 lbs, March 8 ‚Äì 235 lbs, April 1 ‚Äì 227 lbs, May 1 ‚Äì 210 lbs, June 10 ‚Äì 203 lbs, and now August 6 ‚Äì 175 lbs. The progress wasn‚Äôt always consistent or linear, but it was real.

What worked for me was a mix of intermittent fasting (mostly 18:6 or OMAD), extended fasts (I did multiple 5‚Äì10 day fasts), very low-calorie eating on non-fasting days (around 300‚Äì500 kcal sometimes 800 ), and daily walking. No intense workouts just moderate walks, and staying committed to my window or fast. I didn‚Äôt track every calorie or use fancy tools. I just stayed in motion and stayed accountable to myself.

I mostly just ate miso soup, tuna, and coffee for the first 4 months. Averaged 10-15k steps a day. Then mostly boiled chicken and cauliflower rice the last two and no exercise. 

This has been the most effective thing I‚Äôve ever done for myself, and not just physically. My face has changed, my body has changed, but more than anything, my mindset has changed. I no longer feel helpless. I know I still have more to go but I‚Äôve made it this far without shortcuts, and I intend to finish it.",51,1754509676.0,intermittentfasting,5,1.0,False

I've studied up on extraction theory and it looks like even when it's not under/over extracted, it still has some bitter/sour taste. Not none. The weird thing about starbucks coffee is that it somehow has the coffee taste without ANY bitter/sour notes.

I've also varied the amount of hot water as well. It would either be so diluted that I dont taste coffee, or that I taste coffee but there a taste of bitter/sour.

Like seriously, was I living under a rock? I gotta share this one‚Ä¶ because last week I made $100 just from my phone‚Äîyes, my phone‚Äîby TESTING APPS. üò≥

I‚Äôm not exaggerating. Testing apps. That‚Äôs all. I‚Äôm shocked, confused, and honestly still refreshing my PayPal like a lunatic. (It‚Äôs real, all right.)

I‚Äôve seen random ads and posts for ‚Äútesting new apps for cash,‚Äù but always assumed it was either a scam or you‚Äôd earn, like, 20 cents for 7 hours of work. But then I stumbled on this **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and thought, why NOT at least try? Maybe it‚Äôs worth it if only so I can write a salty ‚Äúdon‚Äôt waste your time‚Äù review.

Nope! Here‚Äôs literally what happened:

- Signed up on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** with an email, no crazy info or thirty-minute ‚Äúpersonality test‚Äù
- Picked some apps to try (the tasks are so easy, by the way)
- Each one just asks you to install, play, and review. Some want screenshots; some want a little feedback
- Most paid me within a day (?!), and a couple were instant. Like, within 20 minutes!
- Got a notification, opened PayPal, thought it was a scam-ception‚Ä¶ but it was the real deal

I‚Äôm not a technical guru. I‚Äôm not hacking, side-hustling 6 hours per day, or making TikTok courses.  
Literally just:

- Go to **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
- Try some apps on your phone
- Review/submit your mini-feedback or answer small polls
- Get paid per app/test‚Äîsome even stack up to $10 a pop

At first I thought I was being punked, so I only went for the bottom-tier stuff (nervous, I know). But by the second day, I switched gears like‚Äî ‚ÄúWait, there‚Äôs $7 for literally giving Stars to a new game?‚Äù

It sounds wild, but if you have:

- Free time on your commute
- Slow days at work
- Want extra for coffee, Spotify, or whatever  
There‚Äôs literally money to grab from your couch.

DO NOT get me wrong‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt ‚Äúquit your job‚Äù money. But I made $14 on a boring Monday, caught up on Insta, and didn‚Äôt leave my bed. By Friday I was at $102.50. I mean‚Ä¶ spaceship level confused!

Here‚Äôs my quick take:

- Is this gonna last forever? Who KNOWS.
- Are the apps mostly basic? Yeah, but who clashes with $10 for 8 minutes?
- Worth it? Yes‚Äîespecially if you click this: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
- NO hidden fees or dogs asking for your Social Security. (My theory: more companies pay real people like us now so their games launch better.)

Before you roast me, TRY IT. Or if you‚Äôve used **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** already, lemme know what your strategy is because now I‚Äôm obsessed.

Anyone else accidentally stacking surprise money just for swiping away on their break?? Or should I get checked out because I *still* think this is too good to be true?

Anyway, ATTACHING ONCE AGAIN so you all don‚Äôt miss out: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

A day or two later, I tried to search it up, and realized I forgot the exact title or channel name.

Here's what I do remember.

The video had a caption (not in text as the title, but as a visual that appeared at the top of the screen) that said, ""When you accidentally type üòÇüòÇüòÇüöóüíÄ‚òïüïµÔ∏èüòÇüòÇüòÇ"" or something very close to that.

The contents of the video consisted of two guys (one white, the other brown) laughing in a car, which then quickly switched to a more short-film format, where the white guy was driving his car straight at the other guy. The other guy was slamming a baseball bat against the ground, and then the shot cut before the two collided.  
The shot switched to the white guy beating the other guy up, and then strangling him until he died. Very cinematic.  
It cuts to a scene seemingly weeks or months later.  
The guy who survived is drinking coffee at a cafe, then- he looks in the distance and sees the very man he killed, standing there, wearing a trenchcoat and sunglasses. The man looks at the guy, takes his hand out of his pocket, points a finger gun at him, and ""shoots"" him. The man then vanishes when something obstructs our vision. The guy just sits there.

The description of the short itself mentioned something about how it went viral on instagram, but they aren't sure why it didn't do well on youtube. Also, I think the video was posted 8-10 months ago.

The name of the channel was one of those channel names where it's one of the guy's names, and then ""&"" and then the other guy's name. (I think so, at least, I remember seeing an ampersand in there)

I am thinking about switching from Jura Ena 8 to an Espresso Machine.  
Looks like the grinder in my current Jura Ena 8 has probably died, so I started considering switching to a portafilter espresso machine. I've already done some initial research on both the machine and the grinder, but I have a few questions I hope you can help me with.

**Espresso Machine:**  
Gaggia Classic E24 ‚Äì mainly chosen for its design and a recommendation from a friend.  
I‚Äôve heard about the ""boilergate"" issue, but from what I understand, it only affected the EVO PRO version.  
I‚Äôm planning to replace the OPV spring to allow brewing at 9 bars ‚Äì seems like a simple and non-invasive mod.

Is it worth upgrading the portafilter to a bottomless one and getting a precision basket (e.g., VST)?  
I came across some opinions that just changing the spring without upgrading the portafilter and basket might lead to weak results (too low pressure for the original set). Not sure about steam wand mod, is it worth the money for the begginer?  
Would love to hear your experiences and suggestions.

**Grinder**  
Trying to stay within budget here ‚Äì I'm considering three options:

* Eureka Mignon Classico
* Rancilio Rocky SD
* Lelit Fred

I‚Äôd really appreciate your thoughts ‚Äì do you recommend or advise against any of these in particular?

**Tamper & WDT**  
I haven‚Äôt picked anything yet, so I‚Äôd be happy to get some recommendations. Normcore 58.5mm tamper seems to be popular, but not sure if this is not overkill ?Looking for something reasonable to match the setup above ‚Äì nothing fancy needed since I‚Äôm just starting out :)

Does this setup make sense overall?  
I know there‚Äôs always room to spend more and get something ‚Äúbetter,‚Äù but I‚Äôm trying to find a good balance between price and quality.  
The machine will be used by both me and my wife ‚Äì she mostly drinks milk-based drinks.  
We didn‚Äôt really like the more automated portafilter machines like the Sage Bambino mostly due to design.

I‚Äôd be really grateful for your opinions, advice, and any suggestions you have!  
To be honest, the more I read, the more overwhelmed and uncertain I feel. On one hand, I'm really looking forward to better coffee quality and treating it as a small new hobby. On the other hand, I'm a bit concerned that the improvement might not be significant and that making coffee every day could become noticeably more time-consuming.",1,1754508581.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1mje6x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mje6x7/does_thang_long_vietnamese_coffee_filter_deliver/,Does Thang Long Vietnamese Coffee Filter Deliver the Perfect Brew Review?,"Testing coffee filters has been a significant part of my routine lately. I‚Äôve brewed more cups than I can count with the **Thang Long SYNCHKG077062 Vietnamese Coffee Filter Set**, a staple in traditional Vietnamese coffee-making. Perfect for lovers of caf√© sua da or hot coffee enthusiasts, this stainless steel coffee maker promises quality and durability. With a gravity insert for ease and a sleek, modern design, it quickly became a companion in my kitchen. Though it shines in certain areas, there are also a handful of quirks I had to navigate during my experience. Let me share the details.

**Sleek Design and Compact Build**  
The first thing that caught my attention was its compact and lightweight construction. With dimensions of 3.7""D x 3.7""W x 2.6""H and a weight of just 4.4 ounces, the product hardly occupies any space. Its stainless steel finish not only screams durability but also looks fantastic sitting on my counter. The filter breaks into four pieces, making assembly and disassembly a breeze. The gravity insert stands out, offering an upgrade from traditional screw-down designs. For someone who values simplicity, this detail is a small but meaningful innovation that saves time. 

**Good Points**  
- Built from high-quality stainless steel for durability.  
- The gravity insert simplifies usage.  
- Lightweight and compact; ideal for storage or travel.  

[Check Thang Long SYNCHKG077062 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01953yt1i/)

**Ease of Use**  
Operating this coffee maker was straightforward. It‚Äôs entirely manual, so there are no electronics to fiddle with. Just add coffee grounds, pour hot water, and let it do its magic. The slow dripper mechanism creates a rich, aromatic brew, whether hot or iced. I found the pictorial instructions included in the box helpful when I tried it for the first few times. For those not accustomed to Vietnamese coffee-making, having these easy-to-follow instructions can be a lifesaver. My uncle, who visited once, was so impressed by the simplicity that he ordered one on the spot.  

**Performance and Brewing Experience**  
The quality of the coffee this filter brews amazed me. The slow drip extracts every bit of flavor from the coffee grounds, producing a cup that‚Äôs both bold and smooth. Pair it with Trung Nguyen coffee or your favorite ground beans, and you‚Äôll genuinely feel like an expert barista. I‚Äôve mostly used it for iced coffee and found the process both fun and rewarding. The magic behind the slow-drip technique is real. However, it does require just a bit of patience‚Äîrush the process, and you could miss out on its full potential.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Takes longer to brew compared to modern coffee machines.  
- Stainless steel exterior can heat up, requiring careful handling.  

**Merits and Durability**  
The components are dishwasher-safe, which is a big win for lazy clean-up days. There‚Äôs not a single part that feels flimsy, and the included lifetime warranty gives peace of mind about its longevity. After numerous washes and rigorous use, the product hasn‚Äôt lost its shine or functionality. I appreciate this kind of reliability because too many ‚Äúbudget‚Äù coffee filters show wear or rust after just a few uses. Even my picky mother-in-law gave this one her seal of approval!  

**Product Rivals**  
Comparing this to alternatives like the Aeropress or French presses, this Vietnamese coffee filter has a unique edge in terms of authenticity. French presses tend to produce a stronger coffee, but they‚Äôre less portable and require more effort to clean. Meanwhile, products like the Aeropress brew faster but lack the same silky richness in flavor. While each device might cater to specific niches, this product excels in making Vietnamese-style coffee without frills.  

**Value Proposition**  
Given its robust build and the genuine flavor it delivers, this is a worthwhile investment for any coffee lover. Products with similar quality often cost much more, especially those branded as premium. If you‚Äôre someone who drinks Vietnamese coffee regularly or even wishes to experiment, you‚Äôll get a lot of mileage out of this one. While it‚Äôs not an all-in-one brewing station, its specialized design fulfills its purpose beautifully.

It was late and I was already in the car. I should add it was a fairly short ride, like 15 minutes on surface streets.  
  
If I am driving with friends and it's something planned or long distance, or if it's a favor I've asked for, I always do offer money for gas and offer to pay for lunch or coffee along the way as well.

I would go to work feeling like not everything came out. 

When I got the bug, I went to see my gastro and we talked about probiotic pills. So I picked some up on Amazon. I‚Äôm not sure if I can mention brand names but it basically states it has 60 billion CFU, 10 strains, and organic prebiotics. I cut out the yogurts, and now I exclusively take these. 

After I‚Äôve recovered from the virus, I continued to take these pills and stopped with the yogurts. I also eat a banana from time to time which is something I never used to eat. But that‚Äôs the only difference! Nothing else has changed. I do everything else the same as I was before I got the virus. 

Now, I have the most amazing poops and I haven‚Äôt experienced something like this in years. I get full complete bowel movements in one go, no straining or sitting on the toilet waiting for more to come out, and I also get the ghost wipes. 

I really would like to hear some opinions on this. Should I take these long term? Anyone else here take probiotic pills? 

Of course I‚Äôll be asking my gastro all of these questions the next time I see him. But I would definitely like to hear your input!

1mje2x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Finland/comments/1mje2x2/why_are_people_here_ok_with_the_government_not/,Why are people here OK with the government not wanting to touch the pensions?,"Please read to the end and tell me what you think. Sorry for the long post. 

Every time cuts are discussed, pensions are immediately ruled out. Now again: ‚Ç¨1 billion more cuts coming this autumn, but nothing from pensions. Why?

Pensions are the largest state expense in Finland, over ‚Ç¨39 billion paid in 2024. Yet no politician dares to even mention touching them. Why? Because Finland has over 1.6 million people who are 65+ years old (close to 30% of population) who would never vote those politicians. Then add to this also people who are coming soon to the pension age. They wouldn't vote for it either. 

However, how does it make sense not touching pensions when many pensioners live in conditions as below:

- Own homes mortgage-free
- Have summer cottages and savings
- Enjoy public healthcare and elderly care that won‚Äôt exist for younger generations for sure. 

Are you aware that in elderly care old people press a button so that a nurse can go and mix their sugar in their coffee? Do you think the young generation will have that kind of care? With what resources?

Now, **the solution** is not to decrease everyone's pensions obviously. But why not raise taxes for pensioners who have no mortgage, large assets and live better than any future generation possibly can?

You want to say that because lowering the pensions will cause citizens to lose faith and move elsewhere where their savings and taxes will be put to better use? Guess what? If they don't touch the pensions soon, that's what will happen anyway.

With the demographic problem we have, so few young people coming, how do you expect that the taxes that you are paying now will be saved for you to enjoy your pension when you're old? Are you serious? You're in your 30s and think that when you're a pensioneer you will get the pension these guys have now? While having a mortgage already paid? Quite some dreams you have there.

And while you're dreaming, we are just going more and more in debt, with interest payments going above 3.2 billion euros in interest only. **In interest only!!** And this will only get higher and higher.


Don't answer with yes, we know. If you do know, why are you completely silent about this?

1mje2uz,https://i.redd.it/mnpbkahz9ghf1.jpeg,SOTC - My current rotation of custom pieces,"Here's where I've settled at with my watches after getting some new cases and dials from AliX. The coffee cup logo became a little signature I would engrave when finishing a watch (especially for watches I build for friends as I tend to use their initials on the dial) that stemmed into a micro pattern that I can now engrave onto rotors and in the future, dials and other small watch movement parts.

I am having issues with Reddit uploading multiple photos, so I will link an Imgur album in the comments with lots of extra shots, as well as some combinations of dials/cases from some of my tinkering over the past few months.

L to R:

37mm Explorer case GADA watch -The green dial was new to go into an existing case, and works as a great dialy piece with a pop of color.

38mm rose gold with copper dial - the case and bracelet from Caroline Mods on Alix, this used to house the vinyl record dial (from AndoAndoAndo). The copper dial was originally in a stainless steel case, but has a great monochromatic look with this case and bracelet.

40mm Patek-esque case - All new build, the dial is fully lumed and is my go to watch when I play gigs with mt bands. I love the CTS rubber strap so much, I ordered three more in different colors.

38mm Dress Watch - the case is also from Caroline Mods. The dial is the blank cd texture dial on AliX, and I designed the dial in Inkspace to later be laser engraved (by myself). It compliments the full rose record dial watch, and nails the vintage dress watch vibes on this bracelet.

38mm Rose Gold Dress Watch a new case and bracelet for the existing dial and hand set. Feels really elevated on the mesh bracelet.

40mm 62Mas Diver - This has been unchanged since I changed the hands from Seamaster Arrow Hands in January. It gets lots of wrist time in the summer especially.

1mje1mt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThirtiesIndia/comments/1mje1mt/hear_me_out/,Hear me out!,"Not thirty but wanted to vent out here since I feel people in this sub are wiser than the kids 
I feel so stuck in my life right now.
I feel like a man child. I don't earn I am a liability to my parents I sit all day at home. Doing nothing. There is a govt job opening in my.place and I know I should.prepare for.that but some how I am not preparing for it. I won't believe it on motivation or that bull shit I own it it is totally my fault. My parents are getting older in front my eyes and I can't take care of them. I will be moving to a different place soon far away from home only because I am not preparing for that exam. I mean the opportunity was right in front of me and I did not prepare. Now it's too late. 

Also the career I am in is not a well paying. I mean I would have to spend a decade to be earning well still I won't be able to make what a cs graduate makes after few years of experience 

Leaving aside that part I also not liked by people because I am socially very awkward and introverted. So I appear as arrogant and simply 'manhoos'. During childhood I might have been called a shy child but I am an adult now and I fit the definition of manhoos perfectly 

Last but not the least I am terrible with girls I have been single all my life. I shake even at the thought of talking to girls not like classmates but strangers for example, or people I am acquainted but not regularly talking, even for daily regular purposes I don't even have any romantic interest in still I am scared to death

When I joined college I thought I would change that. I had a few girls I liked so I thought I would approach. I made eye contact smiled at them and they knew I was looking at them and I had a positive feeling that they might like me too but I never approached. 

Then one day a new girl entered college. And my god wasn't she beautiful I mean angel like beauty. She was very tall and my first thought was that she is out of my league. But then for the whole semester I kept thinking and making eye contact like a creep. Without making any move. But finally one day I did. I approached asked her name and all and asked her for a coffee but she said we could be friends and I clearly said I was not looking for friendship. Then it became awkward for the rest of my college since we crossed paths and acted as stranger because I did not know how to act in this situation 

And now the problem is that she is still stuck in my head. Even though college is finished and I know I won't ever see her again. Also I saw her with another guy. And the thought of her with him is killing me.

What should I do in this case pls tell me. üò≠üò≠üò≠
Anyway it's just a rant I just wanted to get it out 
I know it's too long but i dont have the patience to do a TLDR. If you read it fine if you didn't also fine. I just want to fill this void somehow.

I wasn't very big to start with, but I was skinny fat and had tons of fat on my belly. I had one of those body tests at a gym and turns out my BMI is higher than others in are around my weight/age.

When I gain weight, I only gain on my upper belly, especially the belly. So I looked very disproportionate. l've lost 12lbs so far, but there's still fat and loose skin on my belly.
I'm so close to my ideal weight based solely on calorie deficit. 

But lately l've been eating a lot more, including burgers and fries, cookies and ice cream. And when I eat them, I can‚Äôt stop, and I ends up binging. I wouldn‚Äôt eat anything the next day, just tea, black coffee, and sometimes sugar free energy drinks. 

And my weight loss stopped.

1mjdxtr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1mjdxtr/explore_the_best_coffee_percolator_presto_02811/,Explore the Best Coffee Percolator Presto 02811 and Is It Worth It,"The Presto 02811 12-Cup Stainless Steel Coffee Maker left a distinct impression on me during my recent testing. As someone who values both functionality and design in kitchen appliances, I quickly noticed its standout construction and promise of delivering rich, flavorful coffee. The traditional percolator style evokes an old-school charm, blending perfectly with its modern functionality. It‚Äôs an eye-catching piece, particularly if you‚Äôre into hosting and want an appliance that doubles as a conversation starter. At first glance, its polished stainless steel finish suggests durability and elegance, making it fit seamlessly into any kitchen ambiance.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The stainless steel construction was one of the first things to catch my eye. It feels more upscale than other coffee makers I‚Äôve used in the past, and you can tell it‚Äôs built to last. Unlike models with cheaper plastic parts, the Presto 02811 opts for stainless steel parts, including the filter basket and perk tube, which add significant value. The compact 6.25 x 9.5 x 12.9-inch size is another plus for countertop visibility without overwhelming space. Even the detachable power cord is a thoughtful touch. It keeps storage hassle-free and makes it easier to display during social gatherings.

**Performance**  
This coffee maker promises to brew anywhere from 2 to 12 cups of coffee at a brisk cup-a-minute pace, and I decided to see how accurate this was. True to its word, the brewing speed was commendably efficient. I hosted a brunch and effortlessly served my guests steaming hot, consistently brewed coffee. An indicator light alerts when the coffee is ready, which spares you from guessing. The coffee stayed hot throughout the gathering, held at an ideal temperature without burning or losing its flavor, thanks to its automatic heat mode.

**Highlights**  
- Sleek, traditional design with a polished stainless steel finish  
- Brews up to 12 cups at a fast, cup-a-minute rate  
- Keeps coffee warm without overheating  
- Stainless steel filter basket and perk tube ensure durability  
- Compact and storage-friendly design with a removable power cord  

[Check Presto 02811 Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://windtoons.com/p/b00df5honi/)

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
The Presto 02811 was surprisingly intuitive to use. As someone who has wrestled with overly complicated machines before, I appreciated how straightforward this device was. Adding water, measuring coffee grounds, and turning it on was all made exceptionally simple. Cleaning was equally painless; however, I quickly learned that avoiding steel wool or abrasive cleaners is essential to keep its glossy finish intact. The removable perk spout and filter basket are easy to clean with a pipe cleaner or brush, and for occasional deep cleaning, a coffee stain remover works wonders. These maintenance features made it feel like the coffee maker was designed with users in mind.

**Boons**  
- Effortless cleaning even with intricate parts like the perk tube  
- Straightforward setup that doesn‚Äôt require a manual for operation  
- Works quietly without disrupting household conversations  

**Pitfalls**  
No product is without its flaws, and the Presto 02811 has a couple worth mentioning:  
- Lacks advanced features such as a programmable timer found in competing models.  
- Stainless steel construction, while stunning, gets quite hot during operation, so caution is a must.  

**Other Options**  
Comparing this coffee maker to alternatives like the Hamilton Beach Percolator or Cuisinart PRC-12, it‚Äôs evident where Presto shines and where it falls short. While models like the Hamilton Beach offer similar brewing quality, their plastic filter baskets don‚Äôt feel as durable over time. On the other hand, the Cuisinart PRC-12 comes equipped with a water-level indicator, a slight edge for those who appreciate precise measurements. However, these competitors often lack the aesthetic grace of the Presto 02811, making it a better choice for those who prioritize both design and function.

**Financial Value**  
Such a beautifully designed product with the capability to brew up to 12 cups effortlessly certainly provides solid value. The inclusion of durable parts like the stainless steel filter and perk tube puts it ahead of coffee makers in a similar price bracket that rely on cheaper materials. While some pricier alternatives may have additional digital features, the Presto 02811 delivers where it matters most ‚Äì a rich, consistently flavored brew. For anyone who appreciates longevity and simplicity over gadget-heavy devices, this coffee maker fits the bill perfectly.

1mjdwu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mjdwu8/why_is_the_hamilton_beach_brewstation_coffee/,Why is the Hamilton Beach Brewstation Coffee Maker your next essential? Review here!,"Hamilton Beach 47950 Coffee Maker has been a recent addition to my kitchen, and I‚Äôve been systematically testing it to see if it fulfills the promise of a superior brewing experience. With my mornings fueled by coffee and an inherently critical approach to appliances (thanks to years of dealing with kitchen gadgets), I had high hopes‚Äîand some skepticism‚Äîabout this programmable drip machine.  

**Unique Design and Ease of Use**  
This coffee maker ditches the traditional glass carafe in favor of an internal enclosed system. Honestly, this piqued my interest because I‚Äôve had too many shattered carafes in my kitchen disasters. The design is sleek, with a modern black and stainless-steel exterior that complements my other appliances. Its removable reservoir simplifies the chore of refilling water, even on my groggiest mornings. The buttons and digital display are intuitive, and I didn‚Äôt even need to consult the manual to figure things out. That‚Äôs rare for me!  

[Find the best price for Hamilton Beach 47950 on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00af7wuo2/)  

**Performance That Delivers Fresh Coffee Anytime**  
The brewing process has been seamless. The absence of a carafe means I never have to worry about burnt or scorched coffee at the bottom of the pot, something that always annoyed me in older machines. Internal heaters keep the coffee warm and flavorful for hours without the compromised taste. I tested this claim, leaving a batch brewed early in the morning, and sampled it hours later. To my surprise, the coffee tasted just as fresh. It dispenses the coffee directly into a cup (or travel mug if you're rushing out the door), which is as convenient as it gets.  

**Benefits**  
- Sleek design minimizes clutter and eliminates the need for a carafe.  
- Keeps coffee fresh and hot for up to 4 hours‚Äîperfect for morning multitaskers.  
- The removable water reservoir simplifies the cleaning and refilling process.  

**Limitations**  
Admittedly, the 12-cup capacity doesn‚Äôt hold up if you regularly entertain or share coffee with a large group; I found myself brewing another round during family gatherings. Also, the digital cleaning reminder is handy but a tad annoying‚Äîit started insisting on cleaning after just a week of use.  

**Where It Falls Short**  
- Not the best option for larger households or offices due to its 12-cup capacity.  
- Frequent cleaning reminders could get frustrating.  

**Competing Brands**  
When comparing this appliance to rivals like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 and Black+Decker CM2035B, the standout isn‚Äôt just the absence of a carafe but the overall brewing system. Cuisinart offers a larger capacity and a sturdier build, but it doesn‚Äôt deliver quite the same level of fresh-tasting coffee after a few hours. Black+Decker excels with its price point but lacks the programmable features and easy reserving cleaning conveniences offered here. Although the competitors give strong competition, this coffee maker does have a certain niche appeal for drip coffee enthusiasts craving simplicity and taste.  

**Is It Worth It?**  
Evaluating its price-performance ratio, this caffeine wizard feels like a worthwhile investment for habitual coffee drinkers. It excels in functionality while keeping affordability in check. The performance outweighs its few quirks, especially if you prioritize flavor without the risk of burnt coffee. The machine undeniably eliminates potential messes caused by carafes and keeps things as user-friendly as possible.

1mjdw39,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeardAndTested/comments/1mjdw39/evaluate_the_best_overtherange_microwave_lg/,Evaluate the Best Over-the-Range Microwave LG MVEL2125F in Action,"The LG MVEL2125F microwave has been a recent addition to my kitchen and has become an indispensable part of my daily cooking routine. Right from its glossy, stainless-steel exterior to its 2.1 cu. ft. interior, everything about this appliance speaks volumes about thoughtful design and functionality. Its sleek over-the-range design blends seamlessly with my other kitchen appliances while the WideView window is incredibly modern and truly unique. As someone who uses a microwave for more than just reheating coffee, this product seemed like it could meet my high expectations. Spoiler: it mostly does.

**Ease of Use and Standout Features**  
Navigating through the options on this microwave is a breeze thanks to the SmoothTouch glass controls. These buttons don't just look good but react instantly, making the whole experience smoother than most other models. The controls are located conveniently on the right side, and it didn‚Äôt take long to figure them out even for the less tech-savvy among us. One of the standout features here is definitely the ThinQ technology. By using Wi-Fi compatibility, I could connect the microwave to the ThinQ app. Something I didn‚Äôt think I would care much for initially but now count on a lot, especially with the Scan-to-Cook feature. For someone who enjoys easy meals during busy nights, scanning the barcode of frozen foods and letting the microwave do its thing without guesswork feels almost like sorcery.  

[Check LG MVEL2125F price on Amazon.](https://cookarte.com/p/b0bfjn126r/)  

**Cooking Performance and Customization Options**  
With an impressive 1050-watt power output and a variety of cooking settings, this microwave becomes your quiet sous-chef. The sensor cooking mode determines humidity levels of food and adjusts automatically, which means no more undercooked broccoli or overdone popcorn. I‚Äôve relied on its Auto Cook settings for steaming veggies and defrosting meats, both of which yielded surprisingly even and precise results. Bonus points for the ""Add 30 Seconds"" feature because, let‚Äôs admit it, we all love that. If you‚Äôre ambitious and like layering flavors or finishing meals in stages, the 10 power levels can assist in tailoring your cooking with just the right amount of heat.  

**Advantages**  
‚Ä¢ Strikingly sleek and modern design that effortlessly uplifts any kitchen space  
‚Ä¢ Reliable humidity sensors that handle cooking adjustments perfectly for most meals  
‚Ä¢ The ThinQ app integration offers a futuristic cooking experience  
‚Ä¢ Auto Defrost, Steam Cook, and other preset options make it versatile for diverse needs  

**Drawbacks**  
‚Ä¢ It doesn't come with a convection or air frying capability, which feels slightly disappointing at its price range  
‚Ä¢ Despite the LED lighting being energy-efficient, it could be brighter for better visibility during night-time cooking  
‚Ä¢ The exhaust fan, though effective, is louder than expected on high settings  

**Getting Rid of Stubborn Smells and Smoke**  
One aspect where this performs exceptionally well is its ExtendaVent 2.0 system. I was skeptical, but the venting mechanism proved its worth by covering more of the cooktop compared to its rivals. Given that I pan-fry quite often, this addition has done wonders in reducing lingering post-cooking odors. However, I noticed the vent grille is hidden, which looks elegant but can make cleaning a tiny bit challenging during deep cleaning days.   

**Product Comparisons**  
In comparison to similar over-the-range models like the Samsung ME21R7051SS, the LG microwave wins with its Wi-Fi functionality and larger turntable size of 14.2 inches, but Samsung's whisper-quiet fan makes it a strong contender for quieter kitchens. The GE JVM6175SKSS also competes well with its slim design and reliable performance, but it lacks the distinctive Scan-to-Cook tech. Simply put, LG has integrated more futuristic features while giving solid core functionality, albeit with a couple of minor annoyances.

**Quality for Price**  
Let‚Äôs address the elephant in the room ‚Äì is this particular microwave worth the price? Based on my hands-on experience, it is certainly a premium product aimed at enhancing convenience and efficiency. While it may carry a higher tag compared to basic models, those who appreciate additional features like smart connectivity, a stylish, durable finish, and robust cooking presets will find the trade-off worthwhile. However, budget-conscious buyers might want to consider if they truly require features like ThinQ on a regular basis before opting for it.

1mjdvon,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mjdvon/aitah_for_doing_my_own_laundry/,AITAH for doing my own laundry?,"My wife and I have been together for about 10 years, and overall, our relationship is great. The one major difference we‚Äôve always had is how we handle household chores‚Äîspecifically laundry.

I'm someone who likes things clean and done immediately. I can‚Äôt stand seeing messes or unfinished tasks, so I tend to clean as I go. My wife is the opposite‚Äîshe‚Äôs more laid back and prefers to wait until the end of the week (or longer) to tackle chores.

To make it work, we‚Äôve generally divided chores and developed a loose system. For laundry, we‚Äôve had a ""shared responsibility"" approach: if one person washes and dries the clothes, the other folds them. Our clothes go into the same bin, and our three kids each have their own bins. Two of the kids handle their laundry with occasional reminders, which works fine.

The issue is our laundry. I usually end up washing and drying it because I can't stand seeing the bin overflow. But after I move it to the coffee table (our folding spot), it often sits there for days‚Äîsometimes over a week‚Äîuntil my wife gets around to folding it. If I fold everything and put my clothes away, her folded clothes will still sit there for another week until she puts them up. It drives me nuts.

We've argued about this a few times. I‚Äôve asked her to either fold sooner or let‚Äôs figure out a better system. After repeated conflicts, I decided to change my approach. Now, once a week, I pull *just my own* clothes from the shared bin, wash, dry, fold, and put them away‚Äîall in the same day. I‚Äôve also been handling shared items like towels and sheets to keep things fair. So the only laundry my wife is left with is her own.

When I just started doing this one day, she got upset. She says it feels like we‚Äôre roommates instead of partners and that she preferred the old split-task system. She thinks I am over critical about it all and it makes more sense to do all our stuff together and that I am an asshole for just doing my own laundry and leaving her with all of hers. She argues she has more cloths to wash, which is definitely true as I am pretty simple but she changes multiple times a day. She doesn‚Äôt like doing every step of the laundry herself and also didn‚Äôt like that I made the change without a deeper discussion.

From my point of view, I‚Äôm not forcing more work on her‚ÄîI‚Äôm just doing my own laundry to avoid resentment and arguments. It works better for me because I get to wear all my cloths more often, it is checked off my mental to do list more often, and for some reason her doing her own laundry and it sitting on the table seems less annoying haha? It feels like a win-win: I‚Äôm no longer frustrated by seeing clothes sit around, and she can handle hers on her own timeline so no rush. I suspect part of her frustration might be that it highlights the different pace we work at, and maybe that makes her feel bad.

So, AITAH for taking over my own laundry and leaving her to manage hers completely? Advice welcome!",2,1754507857.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The Reach Toothpaste line boasts several formulations, each with unique features designed to enhance your brushing experience. This section will break down these features in detail.

**Reach Advanced Design Brush Head Compatibility:**

This is a core feature that underpins much of Reach's design beliefs. most Reach toothpastes are designed to work synergistically with Reach toothbrushes, notably those with angled necks and interdental bristles. the formula is optimized to flow smoothly between these bristles, ensuring it reaches deep into the gumline and between teeth where plaque and bacteria frequently enough accumulate.

**Fluoride Enriched Formula:**

Fluoride is a crucial ingredient for strengthening tooth enamel and preventing cavities. All Reach toothpastes contain an optimized amount of fluoride, typically around 0.243% sodium fluoride, which is the accepted standard for effective cavity prevention. The specific formulation ensures rapid absorption into the enamel, helping to rebuild weakened areas and protect against acid attacks from sugary and starchy foods.

**Specialized Ingredients for Sensitive Teeth:**

For users with sensitive teeth, reach Sensitive toothpaste includes potassium nitrate, a clinically proven ingredient that helps block pain signals from reaching the nerves in the teeth. The concentration of potassium nitrate is carefully calibrated to provide effective relief without causing irritation. The toothpaste also contains gentle polishing agents, minimizing abrasion on sensitive enamel.

**Whitening Power with Silica Technology:**

Many Reach toothpastes feature advanced silica technology to remove surface stains and brighten teeth. tiny silica particles gently polish the enamel without being overly abrasive. This gradually eliminates discoloration caused by coffee, tea, wine, and other staining substances. The whitening effect is noticeable with consistent use, typically within a few weeks.

**Long-Lasting Freshness with Flavor Burst Technology:**

Reach is known for its refreshing flavors that leave your mouth feeling clean and invigorated. the Flavor burst Technology encapsulates flavoring agents that slowly release during and after brushing, providing a prolonged sensation of freshness. These flavors are carefully crafted and tested to appeal to a wide range of preferences, from classic mint to more adventurous combinations.

## Core Benefits

Switching to or continuing with Reach Toothpaste offers several key benefits. These are real-world advantages that many users experience.

**Effective Plaque Removal:** The carefully designed formula and compatibility with Reach toothbrushes ensure thorough plaque removal. Regular brushing with Reach helps to disrupt and eliminate plaque buildup, preventing the formation of tartar and reducing the risk of gum disease.
**Cavity Prevention:** The fluoride enriched formulation provides strong protection against cavities. Fluoride strengthens tooth enamel, making it more resistant to acid attacks. This reduces the likelihood of developing cavities, saving you from costly dental procedures in the long run.

**Sensitivity Relief:** Reach Sensitive toothpaste effectively reduces tooth sensitivity. The potassium nitrate ingredient blocks pain signals, allowing you to enjoy hot or cold foods and beverages without discomfort. This can substantially improve your quality of life and make daily activities more enjoyable.

**Improved Whitening:** Reach toothpastes containing silica technology gradually but noticeably whiten teeth. Surface stains are gently removed, revealing a brighter and more confident smile. This is a less abrasive and more affordable choice to professional teeth whitening treatments.**Long Lasting Fresh Breath:** The Flavor burst Technology keeps your breath feeling fresh for hours after brushing. This boosts your confidence and ensures that you feel cozy in social situations. The refreshing flavors are pleasant and leave a lingering clean sensation.

1mjdtfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pristiq/comments/1mjdtfx/how_long_until_you_felt_better_after_switching/,How long until you felt better after switching from Paxil to Pristiq?,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm curious about your timelines and experiences.

My background:

On Paxil 40 mg for years (initially for sexual dysfunction), started tapering end of may down to 5 mg by late June.

Started Pristiq 50 mg on May 29‚Äîonly felt better for about a week or two in mid-June after dropping Paxil to 10 mg.

On August 1 my Pristiq was increased to 100 mg.


Other changes:

Stopped beer, coffee, and nicotine in late July.

Taking magnesium at night and omega-3s in the morning.

Using breathing/vagus-nerve exercises and occasional Ativan for panic spikes.

Dealing with a breakup and working 55‚Äì60 hrs/week‚Äîstress is high.


What‚Äôs happening now:

I get short ‚Äúgood‚Äù windows (had a three-hour calm yesterday), but still daily 2‚Äì10 min panic/anxiety waves‚Äîmorning cortisol spikes, surges after meals/showers, and again in the evening.

I‚Äôve been on Pristiq nearly 10 weeks (5 days at 100 mg) but haven‚Äôt stabilized.


My question:
For anyone who switched from Paxil to Pristiq (or another SNRI), how long did it take before you felt steadily better? Did upping to 100 mg help, or did you switch back to an SSRI? Any timelines or tips would be hugely appreciated. Thanks!

1mjdtag,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1mjdtag/reveal_why_the_best_coffee_maker_might_be_the/,Reveal Why the Best Coffee Maker Might Be the Keurig K-Select,"Testing the Keurig 5000198856 coffee maker felt like a morning ritual upgrade. From the first glimpse at its Marine Blue finish, it was clear that this machine was designed to make a statement on the kitchen counter. Sleek and modern, yet functional, it is more than just a pretty face. It offers single-serve convenience while brewing a rich and bold coffee. Over the course of using it daily, I found plenty to enjoy but also noticed a few features that may raise eyebrows.

**Design and Visual Appeal**  
This coffee maker doesn‚Äôt just blend into the background‚Äîit commands attention. Compact enough to fit on smaller counters, the 11.6 x 9.2 x 12.5-inch frame is surprisingly space-conscious. The Marine Blue color popped beautifully in my otherwise neutral kitchen, giving it an elegant touch. Its practical layout, including an easy-to-access control panel, adds plenty to its usability. I wouldn't call the plastic components premium, but they don‚Äôt feel overly cheap either. It's a balance between style and durability that aligns well with its price range.

**Ease of Use and Setup**  
Setting the coffee maker up was a breeze. Straight out of the box, I appreciated the inclusion of a water filter handle, six-count K-Cup Pod variety pack, and filter. These thoughtful extras eliminated the scramble to find a K-Cup or accessory during those rushed mornings. The fully automatic operation and simple button controls mean even someone as bleary-eyed as I am first thing in the morning could brew like a pro. It‚Äôs literally a matter of inserting the pod, choosing a cup size (6, 8, 10, or 12 oz.), and waiting a few seconds for a steaming cup of coffee.

[Check Keurig 5000198856 price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b07t1dc1ns/)

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
The quiet brew technology quickly stood out. Early mornings in my household are loud enough without the added clunking of a coffee machine, so the low noise levels were a surprisingly pleasant addition. The K-Select also has a unique Strong Brew button for days when I needed an extra caffeine kick. The strength of the coffee brewed with this feature wasn‚Äôt espresso-level robust, but it was noticeably bolder than a standard K-Cup brew. The flavor profile? Reliable but somewhat dependent on the pod‚Äôs quality.

**Positives**  
- Quiet Brew Technology minimizes disruptive noise.  
- Strong Brew feature increases coffee strength easily.  
- Large 52 oz. water reservoir for less frequent refills.  
- Versatile drip tray accommodates travel mugs.  

**Negatives**  
- The plastic construction may feel less durable for some users.  
- Strong Brew might not satisfy those who prefer espresso-like intensity.  
- Higher-priced reusable filters add extra cost for brewing ground coffee.  

**Competing Products**  
While the Keurig 5000198856 shines, it is impossible to ignore the stiff competition in the single-serve coffee maker market. Compared to Nespresso‚Äôs VertuoLine, this machine lacks true barista-style quality but wins in accessibility and affordability. Instant Pods may compete on quiet operation, but the Keurig trumps in customization with four brew sizes. For fans of strong coffee made with real grounds, Ninja‚Äôs Specialty Coffee Maker could be considered a strong rival, thanks to its advanced brewing capabilities.

**Value for Money**  
Evaluating the price tag, I found it sits comfortably for what is offered. The Keurig might not cater to gourmet coffee aficionados who demand perfection in every cup. In simplicity, though, it‚Äôs brilliant. Its features‚Äîsuch as multiple brew sizes, a removable drip tray for travel mugs, and the ability to brew several cups before a refill‚Äîmake it worth considering if you‚Äôre looking for reliable single-serve coffee convenience.

New on the craic!! It‚Äôs my first month here since I moved for my job.

Today, I was working from 17:00 to 20:00 at the Starbucks on Henry Street, right across from a Dealz.

During that time, I saw (and counted) 10 groups of different people‚Äîmost of them Irish teenagers‚Äîstealing items from the store. They took Red Bulls, chips, cookies, and even one guy who stole a big pack of spaghetti.

The store staff barely confronted them; they just asked them to leave (understandable). One of the groups even entered the Starbucks where I was sitting after stealing, and I felt really unsafe. I thought they were going to steal my computer and run off.

The last group came in riding scooters and then sped out of the store on their scooters.

I have two questions:

1. Is this normal? It‚Äôs relatively close to the city center, so I didn‚Äôt expect this to happen on such a busy street.
2. I think I can recognise these teenagers on the streets. Should I be afraid of them? Could they steal my backpack or phone while I‚Äôm walking around?

1mjdsmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthAmericanPantheon/comments/1mjdsmf/mikey_and_luke_pre_olive_garden_6/,Mikey and Luke - Pre Olive Garden (6),"I leaned over the table. I was wearing the single button up shirt I own, and it was only misbuttoned by one. 


He was stunning. I was mesmerized by the dark eyes that stared up at me, at the casual smirk. He *had* eaten half of his fajita, which was pretty good for him right now. 


‚ÄúMy fajita wasn‚Äôt sizzling,‚Äù Mikey said in that threatening, secret agent kind of way. 


‚ÄúDamn it, sir!‚Äù I exclaimed, slamming my hand down on the table. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs *not* possible. Not at my Chili‚Äôs.‚Äù


‚ÄúAre you calling me a liar?‚Äù Mikey asked quietly. Dangerously. 


I shook my head.‚ÄúI would never insult a customer like that. I‚Äôll fire every single employee *immediately.*‚Äù


He grabbed the collar of my shirt and pulled me over the table until we were close enough I could have kissed him. 


‚ÄúNot good enough.‚Äù 


I considered biting his nose. I could tell he saw in my eyes. 


‚ÄúWhat are you gonna do to stop me from bombarding your restaurant with sock puppet Google reviews, bro?‚Äù Mikey demanded.


I didn‚Äôt work my way up to imaginary manager of an imaginary Chili‚Äôs to be weak when the situation called for strength. 


‚ÄúProbably going to have to get on my knees to tell you what your patronage means to me and throw in a free dessert coupon.‚Äù


‚ÄúThat's good, bro,‚Äù he praised. ‚ÄúTo start with, anyway.‚Äù


I meant to slide the table over, but with how off balance Mikey had me via my shirt collar I toppled it. That *almost* made him laugh, but he was a professional. Impossible to crack. 


I got on my knees in between his legs. He looked down at me expectantly.


‚ÄúOh bro you want a gift card for a free replacement sizzling fajita platter? Because I can do that. I‚Äôll slip in right into your pocket. Front or back? How about one in each.‚Äù 


It was really hard to put my hands in his pockets while he was sitting, but I did and gave a couple of squeezes. 


‚ÄúGo on.‚Äù


I took off my belt and slipped it around his wrists behind the chair. It wouldn‚Äôt *actually* hold him, but I had yet to find a knot or handcuffs that would. It was mostly just a suggestion until he decided to demote me from imaginary manager to imaginary assistant manager or the imaginary corporate boss came to town. 


Then I reached into my pocket to get the ultimate surprise and showed him a long, green pepper. 


‚ÄúI knew you‚Äôd want to go to Chili‚Äôs on your lunch break, bro.‚Äù


‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a chilli, bro.‚Äù He sounded amused nonetheless.


‚ÄúNo but it‚Äôs really spicy and if you bite into it your mouth will get *spiced* bro so you better be really careful.‚Äù 


I shoved it in his mouth. He looked at me with a tenderness that could have been pride, but I‚Äôm pretty sure was actually just him thinking about what he was going to do once he decided to retaliate. 


He leaned back and let me get started. He actually let me get pretty far before *I* was on the ground with the pepper in my mouth and the belt secured in a much more interesting and elaborate way. 


‚ÄúYou had lots of good ideas, bro. You‚Äôre a *really* good manager. But sometimes the customer is the *most* right, you know, bro?‚Äù 


I couldn‚Äôt argue his logic. Then I couldn‚Äôt think anything much more than ‚Äúholy shit‚Äù and ‚Äúplease do that again.‚Äù The customer was so damn right. 


When he was done, he leaned in close. 


‚ÄúThis will be enough to forestall a Google review bombing for approximately four days.‚Äù


He got up and started putting himself back together for work or director training or whatever the hell he did when he wasn‚Äôt setting me on fire. I started to find my clothes and saw I‚Äôd have to sew most of the buttons back on the shirt again. 


I wished I never had to stop being an idiot with Mikey. I wanted to ask him if he liked Chili‚Äôs better than McDonald‚Äôs. Probably not. He loved being the Hamburgalar and burgling my hams. I wanted to spend all day asking him stupid shit and getting him worked up, but I felt like there were some things that I did *really* need to know sooner than later. 


‚ÄúMikey? Remember when you were like almost on your knees telling me you‚Äôd do anything I ask always and you love me and shit?‚Äù


‚ÄúYeah, bro, I remember.‚Äù


‚ÄúDoes that include like‚Ä¶explaining why you put a luck sucker inside me?‚Äù


‚ÄúShit look at the time!‚Äù


‚ÄúMikey.‚Äù


‚ÄúI *really* can‚Äôt right now, broberry. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù


I begrudgingly put my pants back on, making sure to maintain a perfect pout. 


‚ÄúWill you at least just tell me that you don‚Äôt have a junebug kink?‚Äù I asked.


‚ÄúBro, you *hated* the junebugs. They made you cry.‚Äù


‚ÄúYes bro I *really* hated the junebugs but I couldn‚Äôt tell if you were actually into it or just being goofy.‚Äù


‚ÄúUh...maybe kind of both, bro? I don't know. The whole thing was weird, and you were so cooperative on top of it all. And you know how much I love it when you're *extra* cooperative.‚Äù


‚ÄúBro, you‚Äôre giving me butterflies and I love butterflies but now I‚Äôm thinking of junebugs and then I lose the butterflies.‚Äù I sighed. ‚ÄúMikey, I don‚Äôt mind if you make me do weird shit just you know‚Ä¶maybe like‚Ä¶don‚Äôt engineer weird setups.‚Äù


‚ÄúBut engineering weird setups is my favorite thing, bro.‚Äù


‚ÄúI know it is, bro. I know it is. But I also know you care about my health and safety and mental well being.‚Äù


‚ÄúI guess it's my second favorite thing, because you're my favorite thing, bro.‚Äù


He kissed me and then went back to work. I went to bother Christophe. We tried to bother Raf. He was in the throes of some sort of emotional breakdown fueled by whatever decisions he and Mikey had made recently. Larry had helped. 


Raf didn‚Äôt open his door. 


I said screw it and went for a walk in the woods. I *had* been trying to behave. I really had been, but Mikey didn‚Äôt even care that I stole the Camry. He had called it a time wasting, minuscule ‚Äúsun.‚Äù So I figured I could start going on my walks again. 


The walks were a great way to get a feel for how lucky I was at any given moment. The luckier I was, the more cool shit I would find. Treasures and animals and friends. The unluckier I was, the more I would just get lost. 


So I guess I was pretty unlucky right then. I got *really* lost. It was fun for the first couple of hours, but then I started to get a bit freaked out. Not because I was *worried* about being lost, but because of some of the longer term implications around the fact that I *could* be. Not to mention that Mikey had promised me a thorough disciplinary review, and I didn‚Äôt want to miss it. 



I did find a creek, though. That was pretty cool. It was a good one, fresh and bubbly. I followed it, looking for fish and cool rocks, until I heard Sol say her nickname for me. 


She was saying I was worried about something. I moved slowly and carefully, as quietly as possible. 


‚ÄúHe has good reasons to worry. But yes, the water is as lovely as the present company,‚Äù Gunnar‚Äôs voice replied.


Of fucking course Gunnar was here. I couldn‚Äôt spit without it landing on him. 


‚ÄúOh, *do you* have some nefarious plans about me?‚Äù Sol asked, the slightest bit of nerves in her flirting. She still sounded way too cocky to me, but maybe that was helpful. 


‚ÄúI have no plans whatsoever, nefarious or otherwise. Plans typically require elements that just aren't present here.‚Äù


‚ÄúThen I don‚Äôt see any reason to worry, enlighten me pretty please?‚Äù


‚ÄúI must admit I'm not in an enlightening sort of mood. Even if I was, I'd satisfy that mood elsewhere. What I will say is that even by the usual standards of your...colleagues, I'm distinctly unbearable.‚Äù


I inched a bit further until I could see them. Sol‚Äôs back was to me. They were in a very nice looking swimming hole. I was pretty jealous of that part. I hadn‚Äôt been swimming for a long time. 


I‚Äôm not sure *anything* could have convinced me to get in the water with Gunnar, though. He had said he was like an eel once, and something about how naturally he seemed to exist as he swam‚Ä¶it screamed *predator.* Like he was *made* to exist at the end of dark water in the forest and pull you under. A trick of the shadows from where I was standing made his eyes look black as he stared at Sol intently.


‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre very much bearable,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI like the horn texture a lot‚Äî it‚Äôs gnarly and delicate at the same time.‚Äù


‚ÄúYou only find me bearable because you haven't seen what's under the skin. Or under the horns, as it were.‚Äù


‚ÄúI would like to see.‚Äù


‚ÄúWhy? Because of what you think you'll find there?‚Äù


He smirked as he said it, and I wasn‚Äôt sure if he was *a* devil or maybe even *the* devil. I kinda wanted to yell for Sol to get the hell out of there, but also knew she was probably a bit into that, and maybe it would just make things worse.


‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have expectations. I‚Äôm just curious as to what I will find.‚Äù


She didn‚Äôt seem to feel the same overwhelming sense of *threat* radiating from him that I did. 


‚ÄúWhat you'll find will drown you. And this time, there won't even be a pretty siren to trick you into believing it's all worthwhile.‚Äù


‚ÄúTrust me, I can hold my breath for ages now and you‚Äôre very pretty. I could also stop trying to crack you open and just leave, if you don‚Äôt find being gotten to know by me fun and just want to be shallowly admired for the cool face you put on everyday.‚Äù


He looked at her, and something of the threatening aura seemed to fade, along with the predatory look in his eyes. 


Gunnar only liked people he could make squirm, and Sol hasn‚Äôt squirmed.


‚ÄúAt risk of sounding dramatic, there are many, many different ways to drown. I know you know at least a few  But I know them all, which is why I doubt you can hold your breath - literal or otherwise - long enough to survive anything I consider substantial, let alone meaningful. Apologies, but I'm required elsewhere.‚Äù


He left the swimming hole, and I lost sight of him. 


This put me in an awkward spot. I didn‚Äôt really want to be all ‚Äúhey I was spying on your date in the middle of the woods‚Äù but I *also* didn‚Äôt want to be lost in the woods for three days again. Sol probably would be pretty annoyed that I creeped on her, even if it was mostly an accident and I was hoping she didn‚Äôt get pulled under by a devil. 


‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre not suffering too badly from whatever it is that keeps you coming back to stare at me whenever dear Michael is too busy for you.‚Äù 


Well. That solved that.


I smiled, cocky like Mikey would be. ‚ÄúNot on purpose, bro. I can‚Äôt go anywhere without running into you.‚Äù


‚ÄúI imagine luck has something to do with it, although I can't quite imagine what that something is.‚Äù


‚ÄúI do know what it is today, bro,‚Äù I said, falling into step next to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really fucking lost, and I‚Äôm guessing you aren‚Äôt. Can I follow you back?‚Äù


He smiled politely. ‚ÄúI doubt I could stop you if I wanted to.‚Äù


The icecream parlor had taken a bit of a bite out of my Gunnar fear. *Especially* him and Rey bitching each other out, and the fact that I was more afraid of Rachele than him. I mean, I wasn‚Äôt about to go swimming with him, but I could walk next to him. 


His pale skin practically glowed white in the dusky night. The silence made me feel odd.


‚ÄúGot a special quest for me bro? Maybe a nice macguffin or a gold fiddle?‚Äù I asked. 


‚ÄúMacguffins are beneath even you, although I am a fair violin player.‚Äù


*All* of his menace was gone. I mean, he was still obviously dangerous, but the sense of ‚Äúwanting to eat someone alive‚Äù had evaporated. It almost reminded me of the difference between Christophe in his rage fervor and Christophe goofing off with Mikey.


‚ÄúKinda be shocked if you weren‚Äôt, bro.‚Äù


‚Äú*You* would be.‚Äù


‚ÄúAre you older or younger than Little House on the Prairie?‚Äù


‚ÄúOlder.‚Äù


‚ÄúHow old based on like‚Ä¶American Girl Dolls. Samantha? Keirstin?‚Äù


He paused long enough that I thought he might be too annoyed to keep talking. 


‚ÄúSomewhere between Addy and Samantha.‚Äù


‚ÄúAw man, I knew I should have thrown Addy in there. You remember that part in the first one where she had to eat the worms? That stuck with me.‚Äù


At least I didn‚Äôt have to *eat* the junebugs. The popping might have killed me.


‚ÄúI do remember. Believe it or not, I read most of the earlier books with my daughter.‚Äù


‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶kind of surprising, but cool man. Things sounded kind of messy with all that so I‚Äôm glad she had a good dad.‚Äù


I really was glad that Christophe‚Äôs daughter had a dad who loved her enough to sit there and read girl books. That probably meant he loved her enough to be gentle when he brushed her hair, and to listen to *her* interests, and probably be there when she was sad. 


That probably meant he loved her as much as any kid deserved to have a parent love them at least. And not in that ‚Äúlove the parts of themselves they see in the kid‚Äù way, but for real.


‚ÄúI would never claim to be a good father, but just like her, I played the hand I was dealt.‚Äù


‚ÄúDid you sell her?‚Äù I asked, genuinely curious. ‚ÄúTo your guys‚Äô R&D or a different one?‚Äù


‚ÄúNo.‚Äù


 He seemed almost offended I would even think of it. I couldn't believe that with all the bullshit I spewed constantly, *that* was what got him.


‚ÄúBetter than my dad then. Not a high bar, but it counts for something right?‚Äù


Gunnar almost missed a step. ‚ÄúI'm sorry, are you saying your father *sold* you?‚Äù


‚Äú*That‚Äôs* weird to you?‚Äù I asked, genuinely incredulous. It wasn‚Äôt like we were surrounded by people with great fathers. ‚ÄúRented I guess? The same thing you maybe tried to do with the marrow or whatever. I don‚Äôt think it ever really worked, but it‚Äôs not like your boss is the first one to think of it.‚Äù


‚ÄúThat is rather strange to me, yes. Even my mother never - I'm sorry.‚Äù I could almost feel him slipping his mask back on over the next few steps. ‚ÄúYes. It's strange to me.‚Äù


‚ÄúHuh. They were pretty persistent about it. I don‚Äôt think it was one of the big groups because these guys couldn't for more than a day or so. I‚Äôd think the AHH could at least last a week, especially when I was younger.‚Äù


‚ÄúTell me more. And I mean that earnestly.‚Äù


‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you they‚Äôre all dead now.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt feel bad, and I made sure that was clear in every word. ‚ÄúThey pushed a bit too hard, you know? I got mad. Beam gave out in the lab right over something that exploded pretty good. Lots of fire, lots of electric things going haywire. None of the sprinklers worked. None of the emergency doors did either. Bad luck on their end.‚Äù


Gunnar was quiet again for a long time.


‚ÄúLoath as I am to say this, you and I really ought to properly discuss this over dinner, or at least a coffee,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou're welcome to bring Michael, of course. And if it makes you more comfortable, I'll bring Merry.‚Äù


Mentioning Merry threw me off guard in a way that was horribly unsettling. I had visited Merry once right after his breakdown, and then the next time I tried they had said that he didn‚Äôt want company. I had‚Ä¶I hadn‚Äôt thought to visit him since.


‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know what we‚Äôd have to talk about, but I‚Äôll talk about it with Mikey. And thanks for helping me get home.‚Äù


‚ÄúMy pleasure,‚Äù he said, opening up the gate for me. 


I practically *ran* to Mikey. Not because I was scared, or nervous, or threatened, but because he had gotten off his shift half an hour ago and I missed him. 


I swept him off his feet in a hug when I got to our room. He just kissed me from his higher vantage point. 


‚ÄúI think we should go get a drink,‚Äù he said when he was done.


I set him down. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù 


‚ÄúCome on bro, please? Just one?‚Äù


‚ÄúIt makes you sick,‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll put something else down your throat if you want, but no alcohol.‚Äù


Mikey did seem almost convinced by that. Something about him was like Gunnar in the water, but I‚Äôd let him drag me anywhere. 


There were so many damn things we *needed* to talk about, and I needed him not to run away. Then a thought struck me.


‚ÄúI got an idea for a game, bro. A really good one.‚Äù


‚ÄúI‚Äôm listening.‚Äù


‚ÄúWe each ask one question. Then it‚Äôs a seduce-off. The one who *gives in* first has to answer the other person‚Äôs question to get what they want.‚Äù


‚ÄúThat sounds like a whole lot of effort to get lucky when one of us is already the luckiest man in the world, bro.‚Äù


‚ÄúScared bro? And just because you‚Äôre the luckiest man in the world to have me begging you to do what you do doesn‚Äôt mean it won‚Äôt be fun, bro.‚Äù


Mikey grabbed my hand and guided me to the bed, then gently pushed me onto it.


‚ÄúBro, if you want to play games, I can come up with a lot more fun ones than that. How about we *start* with one of mine, and then we think about going to yours?‚Äù


‚ÄúWhy? Think you‚Äôll lose?‚Äù I stretched out enticeingly, letting my shirt ride up, and ran my hand through my hair. 


‚ÄúNo bro, I *don‚Äôt* lose, but I don‚Äôt like beating you either.‚Äù He leaned over me, his hand casually resting on my ab. ‚ÄúNot unless you *really* beg me too.‚Äù


I smiled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so sweet, bro. Except for when you‚Äôre deflecting.‚Äù


‚ÄúDeflection is in my genes, bro. I can‚Äôt help it.‚Äù


I sat back up and tucked my shirt in, never breaking eye contact.


‚ÄúI‚Äôm not giving it up easy tonight bro. You‚Äôre going to have to work for it.‚Äù


Mikey came up next to me and untucked it.


‚ÄúI like working, bro. Come on, I'm a Wingaryde - working is the only thing we're good at.‚Äù


‚ÄúNot the only thing bro, and you damn well know it.‚Äù Then I remembered I should probably tell him a few things. ‚ÄúOh, by the way Gunnar wants you and me and Merry to get dinner and talk about my childhood trauma or something idk man.‚Äù


‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù


‚ÄúWell bro you are also good at copulation.‚Äù


‚ÄúNo, not that. I mean about Gunnar. He wants to meet with us, with *Merry* along? Are you sure?‚Äù


‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what he said bro. I dunno, maybe I said something weird? He was just talking about his daughter and I said something and then he said that me and him need to talk and I could bring you and he‚Äôd invite Merry too. Maybe‚Ä¶I was a bad bro?‚Äù


‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you what - if you go to dinner or brunch or coffee or whatever the Hell else with Gunnar and Merry and me, I'll play the seduction game afterwards. I'll make sure I lose so you can ask all the questions you want.‚Äù


Mikey was getting too excited. I was starting to dread the shovel gleam a little bit. Nothing good every really came from it.


‚ÄúHuh bro?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúThat seems backwards. You *want* to go talk to him? And bro‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶I just want to know *why* you did shit with the luck sucker. Because I know you love me enough that you must have a good reason. Like you don‚Äôt even have to tell me all of it, just part.‚Äù


‚ÄúI'll tell you everything after we hear what Gunnar has to say, bro, *swearsies.* I'd do it now, except I have to run and tell Raf about this. Is there anything else Gunnar said to you, or anything weird he did that you can think of?‚Äù


‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶he was hitting on Vinny‚Äôs sister‚Ä¶ we were talking about literature and dads‚Ä¶I told him about a time I blew up a lab when they tried to needle me bad? Can you give me a hint, Mikey? Kinda weird for you to leave me hard off bro.‚Äù


‚ÄúIt'd take too long to explain, bro, but basically we think he's not exactly playing by his own company's rules, and if we can prove that, we can get rid of him!‚Äù


It was enough of a hint for me to not keep running. everything through my mind again and again after he ran out the door.

Just realized I've been getting One Piece vibes from this show.,"I watched TNG on tv growing up. Recently watched DS9 and although great writing and characters, I didn't really enjoy it. I think the religious stuff and war stuff both were interesting but not really fun. Coming from DS9, Voyager was a much needed breath of fresh air.

Voyager is wonderful. It's the type of ST that i enjoy the most. And something about the way Janeway was trying to help another race and picking up crew along the way, gave me One Piece vibes (manga/anime/live action, not the dress style). 

The found a cook, The Doctor trying to help 7 of 9. The  and general overall positive vibes. The ingenuity of crew members to punch above Voyager's weight class. They have a goal and are all united in achieving it. 

I know a lot of these things are kind of just generic story. But something about the way Voyager is doing it.
The constant hunt for meat for the one piece crew or coffee for Voyager. Crossing the blue line (it's been awhile. Red line?) and crossing into the Delta quadrant.

I'm finishing up season 4 this week. 

My ST list starting with most enjoyable:


TNG
Voyager (probably) 
SNW (season 1 and 2 so far) 
Discovery
Enterprise
DS9

I haven't seen: TOS, Lower Decks, animated ST. Im sure I'm forgetting something here.

Good times. 

Anyone else get the One Piece vibes from Voyager?

1mjdr0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mjdr0w/unheard_voices_part_3/,Unheard Voices Part 3,"Chapter 11: The Voice Unmasked

David

The morning was colder than it should‚Äôve been.

David stood at the top of the concrete steps outside his apartment, hands buried in the sleeves of his hoodie. He hadn't slept. Not a minute. Not after the episode he released hours ago‚Äîthe one that cracked open a vault no one had wanted to admit was real.

It wasn‚Äôt just a podcast anymore.

It was a trigger.

He didn‚Äôt know the cops were already on their way.

The unmarked car rolled to the curb with quiet finality. Two detectives stepped out, their coats too clean for the neighborhood. The taller one held up his badge.

‚ÄúDavid Serna?‚Äù

David blinked, tightening his grip inside his sleeves. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôd like you to come with us.‚Äù

He hesitated. ‚ÄúAm I being arrested?‚Äù

The second one, heavier and visibly exhausted, shook his head. ‚ÄúNot yet. But we have questions. You‚Äôll want to cooperate.‚Äù

Sam Carter stepped around from the car, arms crossed. His expression wasn‚Äôt hostile‚Äîjust heavy with expectation.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù he said.

David nodded and stepped into the car.

Inside the Precinct

The air inside the station smelled like cold coffee and old carpeting. David sat across from Carter and Torres at a small table in an interview room. A single red light blinked on the recorder between them.

‚ÄúYou made a hell of noise,‚Äù Torres said, flipping through a printout of transcripts from David‚Äôs podcast.

David leaned in. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all in the case files. You had the same evidence I did. You just didn‚Äôt look.‚Äù

David stared at the recorder. ‚Äúhe started with my mother. And I think‚Ä¶ I think he knew me.‚Äù

Torres raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying you met this guy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember. Not clearly. Just flashes. But that note‚Ä¶‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt written for the world. It was written for me. He knew I‚Äôd find it. Eventually.‚Äù

Sam leaned forward, elbows on the table. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not treating you as a suspect, David. But you‚Äôre close to this. Closer than anyone‚Äôs ever been. If he‚Äôs reaching out to you‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not reaching out,‚Äù David said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs performing. And I‚Äôve become the audience.‚Äù

They questioned him for over an hour. About the podcast. About his research. About the timeline of his obsession. They didn‚Äôt say it, but he knew what they were really wondering.

Was he too close? Too damaged? Too useful?

When they let him go, a camera crew was already outside the station. He ignored the shouted questions and walked straight through the crowd, hoodie pulled low over his face.

His name was no longer anonymous.

But the story wasn‚Äôt over.

Not yet.

Elsewhere ‚Äì The Whisperer‚Äôs Room

The TV flickered in the corner, casting soft light across the room‚Äôs padded walls. The audio was low, barely audible under the hum of an old shortwave radio. On the screen, David was being led from the precinct, shoulders tense, eyes heavy with sleep deprivation and something worse memory.

The banner across the news feed read:
‚ÄúPODCASTER AT CENTER OF SERIAL KILLER INVESTIGATION.‚Äù

The Echo sat in a well-worn armchair, his coat folded neatly beside him. A mug of tea steamed in his hand, untouched.

He watched David‚Äôs face on the screen, watched the boy he had seen long ago become a man.

The voice in the interview cracked faintly through the radio. Just a clip, a breath.

But it was enough.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre finally listening,‚Äù the Keeper whispered to himself.

He picked up his notebook.

On the first page of a new section, he wrote:

‚ÄúIf death is welcome let him seek it there.‚Äù

Then he turned to the pages he had written before filled with names, phrases, deaths. Each one a chord in the symphony. A silence sculpted into meaning.

He chose one phrase. Short. Measured. Deliberate.

‚ÄúThere a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life‚Äù

He slid it into a plastic sleeve, folded it, and pressed it between the pages of book.

A favorite, now more than just metaphor.

He paused over one name on the final page of his list.

Not chosen yet. But very close.

He looked back at the screen.

‚ÄúSoon,‚Äù he murmured, and the static swallowed his voice.

Chapter 12: The Keeper‚Äôs Score

David

The days bled combing through old files, hours spent staring at the wall, hours spent listening to the silence that now filled his apartment. The podcast had done its job; the city was listening. But the cost was becoming clearer with each passing moment.

He hadn't heard from the police since his interview. No calls. No follow-ups. It was as if they had gotten what they needed and moved on.

But David couldn't move on. Not yet.

The note he'd found in his mother's belongings‚Äîthe one that had haunted him since childhood‚Äîkept resurfacing in his thoughts.

""She recite to him. I listened, too"".

What did it mean?

He needed answers.

He stood from his desk, restless. The corkboard near the wall was now cluttered with printed screenshots, hand-scribbled quotes, torn photos, and red thread connecting timelines. His mother was no longer a single file in a dusty cabinet. She was the opening stanza in a symphony of violence.

And now, the music was swelling again.

Elsewhere ‚Äì Crime Scene Near the Past

It happened just after dusk.

A woman in her forties, walking home from the train station, took the long way down Eastburn Avenue‚Äîa narrow residential street bordered by chain-link fences and boarded-up homes.

The shot was precise. Clean. No witnesses.

Her body was found half an hour later, sprawled on the edge of a crumbling sidewalk just four blocks from where Cassandra Serna had been murdered in 94.

The crime scene was eerily minimal‚Äîno signs of struggle, no wallet taken, no personal belongings disturbed. Just a single object placed gently beside the victim‚Äôs hand:

A worn book.

Tucked inside its pages, was a folded note written in careful, deliberate script:

‚ÄúThere a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life‚Äù

Detectives cordoned off the street. The book was bagged. The message was sent to forensics. But to anyone paying attention, the meaning was immediate and terrifying.

He was returning.

To where it all began.

David

He saw it first on a crime blog.

Then on a subreddit.

Then it was everywhere.

Woman killed few blocks from Cassandra Serna‚Äôs murder site. Victim left with book and note.

David stared at the screen, unmoving, as the words burned into his retinas.

His mother had a copy, once. It used to sit on their shelf when he was a kid. She  read it to him, and he remembered the cover‚Äîthe crown, the symbol, the name. It had captive him then.

It terrified him now.

He printed the photo of the crime scene and pinned it beneath his mother‚Äôs.

A circle was closing.

And the music was playing again.

at the station.

case files had a particular smell to them‚Äîaged paper, dried ink, and something more elusive. Like the breath of time itself. Sam Carter had spent most of the morning elbow-deep in the archives, the sound of creaking folders and rustling documents louder than the chatter of the precinct outside.

Torres stepped in, carrying two coffees. She didn‚Äôt even wait for a greeting before sliding one across the cluttered desk.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been on that wall for five hours,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôre about to start speaking in haikus.‚Äù

Sam didn‚Äôt respond. His eyes were fixed on a folder dated 1998. The name on the cover: Elaine Brandon. A black-and-white photo sat inside, depicting a woman found in an alley‚Äîface turned toward the bricks, eyes half-lidded, like she‚Äôd been trying to listen to something only she could hear.

‚ÄúThis one was ruled a robbery gone bad,‚Äù Sam muttered. ‚ÄúNo suspect. No follow-up.‚Äù

He slid the photo to her. Taped to the inside of the woman‚Äôs shirt, just beneath her right hand, was a scrap of paper.

Torres leaned in. ‚Äú‚ÄòThe quiet ones never forget,‚Äô‚Äù she read aloud. Her brow furrowed. ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt in the summary.‚Äù

‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt in the digital report either,‚Äù Sam said. ‚ÄúI only found it buried in the original scene documentation. The note was dismissed. Labeled ‚Äònon-evidentiary.‚Äô‚Äù

She tilted her head. ‚ÄúAnd now you think it connects?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know it connects.‚Äù He tapped the board behind him, where photos and notes had begun to form a constellation. ‚ÄúCassandra Serna. Elaine Brandon. Jessica Nguyen. Eric Lane. Every message. Every signature. Same rhythm.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy now?‚Äù Torres asked. ‚ÄúWhy resurface after all this time?‚Äù

Sam stared at the red pins on the map. ‚ÄúMaybe he never stopped. Maybe we just stopped listening.‚Äù

Her phone buzzed. Torres glanced at the screen‚Äîand swore under her breath.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got another one,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSouthside. Three blocks from where Cassandra Serna was killed.‚Äù

Sam stood before she finished.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs move.‚Äù

The Scene

The victim, a woman in his early forties, lay slumped against the wall, eyes open. One clean shot. No signs of struggle.

Torres crouched near the body. ‚ÄúSame method. Same message?‚Äù

Sam didn‚Äôt answer immediately. He‚Äôd already seen it.

Near the victim‚Äôs hand lay a book.

The cover was aged, its spine cracked, but intact. Sam pulled on his gloves and opened the front flap.

Tucked inside was a folded note in a plastic sleeve.

It read:

‚ÄúThere a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life‚Äù

Sam‚Äôs gut clenched.

The address, the timing, the message‚Äîit was all deliberate.

He turned slowly, scanning the shadows, as if expecting the killer to be standing just out of reach, watching the score unfold.

‚ÄúHe is getting close,‚Äù Sam whispered. ‚ÄúWhere she died.‚Äù

Torres looked up. ‚ÄúCassandra?‚Äù

He nodded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just a murder. It‚Äôs a reprise.‚Äù

David

Something‚Äîintuition, dread‚Äîhad pulled him from sleep before the sun had fully risen. The apartment was silent except for the hum of his laptop still running on the desk.

He poured coffee with a trembling hand and opened the email inbox for the podcast account. Among the sea of spam, tips, and media requests, one new subject line caught his eye.

‚ÄúSouthside. The King returns.‚Äù

No sender name.

Just a location. A set of GPS coordinates.

And a timestamp.

He froze.

It was a place he knew.

Elsewhere ‚Äì The Keeper

He watched the news report replay on a muted television in the corner of a different room. Cleaner. More sparse. Just a chair, a table, a book missing its title page, and a single bulb dangling from the ceiling.

The reporter‚Äôs voice was silent, but the words scrolled clearly across the screen:

‚ÄúAnother body discovered near the 1994 murder of Cassandra Serna.
Book left at the scene raises new questions about ‚ÄòThe Whisperer.‚Äô‚Äù

He smiled faintly.

The tempo was shifting again.

And this time, David was getting closer to the melody.

David

The morning was colder than it should‚Äôve been.

David stood at the top of the concrete steps outside his apartment, hands buried in the sleeves of his hoodie. He hadn't slept. Not a minute. Not after the episode he released hours ago‚Äîthe one that cracked open a vault no one had wanted to admit was real.

It wasn‚Äôt just a podcast anymore.

It was a trigger.

He didn‚Äôt know the cops were already on their way.

The unmarked car rolled to the curb with quiet finality. Two detectives stepped out, their coats too clean for the neighborhood. The taller one held up his badge.

‚ÄúDavid Serna?‚Äù

David blinked, tightening his grip inside his sleeves. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôd like you to come with us.‚Äù

He hesitated. ‚ÄúAm I being arrested?‚Äù

The second one, heavier and visibly exhausted, shook his head. ‚ÄúNot yet. But we have questions. You‚Äôll want to cooperate.‚Äù

Sam Carter stepped around from the car, arms crossed. His expression wasn‚Äôt hostile‚Äîjust heavy with expectation.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù he said.

David nodded and stepped into the car.

Inside the Precinct

The air inside the station smelled like cold coffee and old carpeting. David sat across from Carter and Torres at a small table in an interview room. A single red light blinked on the recorder between them.

‚ÄúYou made a hell of noise,‚Äù Torres said, flipping through a printout of transcripts from David‚Äôs podcast.

David leaned in. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all in the case files. You had the same evidence I did. You just didn‚Äôt look.‚Äù

David stared at the recorder. ‚Äúhe started with my mother. And I think‚Ä¶ I think he knew me.‚Äù

Torres raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre saying you met this guy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember. Not clearly. Just flashes. But that note‚Ä¶‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt written for the world. It was written for me. He knew I‚Äôd find it. Eventually.‚Äù

Sam leaned forward, elbows on the table. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not treating you as a suspect, David. But you‚Äôre close to this. Closer than anyone‚Äôs ever been. If he‚Äôs reaching out to you‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not reaching out,‚Äù David said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs performing. And I‚Äôve become the audience.‚Äù

They questioned him for over an hour. About the podcast. About his research. About the timeline of his obsession. They didn‚Äôt say it, but he knew what they were really wondering.

Was he too close? Too damaged? Too useful?

When they let him go, a camera crew was already outside the station. He ignored the shouted questions and walked straight through the crowd, hoodie pulled low over his face.

His name was no longer anonymous.

But the story wasn‚Äôt over.

Not yet.

Elsewhere ‚Äì The Whisperer‚Äôs Room

The TV flickered in the corner, casting soft light across the room‚Äôs padded walls. The audio was low, barely audible under the hum of an old shortwave radio. On the screen, David was being led from the precinct, shoulders tense, eyes heavy with sleep deprivation and something worse memory.

The banner across the news feed read:
‚ÄúPODCASTER AT CENTER OF SERIAL KILLER INVESTIGATION.‚Äù

The Echo sat in a well-worn armchair, his coat folded neatly beside him. A mug of tea steamed in his hand, untouched.

He watched David‚Äôs face on the screen, watched the boy he had seen long ago become a man.

The voice in the interview cracked faintly through the radio. Just a clip, a breath.

But it was enough.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre finally listening,‚Äù the Keeper whispered to himself.

He picked up his notebook.

On the first page of a new section, he wrote:

‚ÄúIf death is welcome let him seek it there.‚Äù

Then he turned to the pages he had written before filled with names, phrases, deaths. Each one a chord in the symphony. A silence sculpted into meaning.

He chose one phrase. Short. Measured. Deliberate.

‚ÄúThere a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life‚Äù

He slid it into a plastic sleeve, folded it, and pressed it between the pages of book.

A favorite, now more than just metaphor.

He paused over one name on the final page of his list.

Not chosen yet. But very close.

He looked back at the screen.

‚ÄúSoon,‚Äù he murmured, and the static swallowed his voice.

Chapter 12: The Keeper‚Äôs Score

David

The days bled combing through old files, hours spent staring at the wall, hours spent listening to the silence that now filled his apartment. The podcast had done its job; the city was listening. But the cost was becoming clearer with each passing moment.

He hadn't heard from the police since his interview. No calls. No follow-ups. It was as if they had gotten what they needed and moved on.

But David couldn't move on. Not yet.

The note he'd found in his mother's belongings‚Äîthe one that had haunted him since childhood‚Äîkept resurfacing in his thoughts.

""She recite to him. I listened, too"".

What did it mean?

He needed answers.

He stood from his desk, restless. The corkboard near the wall was now cluttered with printed screenshots, hand-scribbled quotes, torn photos, and red thread connecting timelines. His mother was no longer a single file in a dusty cabinet. She was the opening stanza in a symphony of violence.

And now, the music was swelling again.

Elsewhere ‚Äì Crime Scene Near the Past

It happened just after dusk.

A woman in her forties, walking home from the train station, took the long way down Eastburn Avenue‚Äîa narrow residential street bordered by chain-link fences and boarded-up homes.

The shot was precise. Clean. No witnesses.

Her body was found half an hour later, sprawled on the edge of a crumbling sidewalk just four blocks from where Cassandra Serna had been murdered in 94.

The crime scene was eerily minimal‚Äîno signs of struggle, no wallet taken, no personal belongings disturbed. Just a single object placed gently beside the victim‚Äôs hand:

A worn book.

Tucked inside its pages, was a folded note written in careful, deliberate script:

‚ÄúThere a painless death awaits him who can no longer bear the sorrows of this life‚Äù

Detectives cordoned off the street. The book was bagged. The message was sent to forensics. But to anyone paying attention, the meaning was immediate and terrifying.

He was returning.

To where it all began.

David

He saw it first on a crime blog.

Then on a subreddit.

Then it was everywhere.

Woman killed few blocks from Cassandra Serna‚Äôs murder site. Victim left with book and note.

David stared at the screen, unmoving, as the words burned into his retinas.

His mother had a copy, once. It used to sit on their shelf when he was a kid. She  read it to him, and he remembered the cover‚Äîthe crown, the symbol, the name. It had captive him then.

It terrified him now.

He printed the photo of the crime scene and pinned it beneath his mother‚Äôs.

A circle was closing.

And the music was playing again.

at the station.

case files had a particular smell to them‚Äîaged paper, dried ink, and something more elusive. Like the breath of time itself. Sam Carter had spent most of the morning elbow-deep in the archives, the sound of creaking folders and rustling documents louder than the chatter of the precinct outside.

Torres stepped in, carrying two coffees. She didn‚Äôt even wait for a greeting before sliding one across the cluttered desk.

Using the GoldTone TEK-cwf-12-gt water filters for my Cuisinart coffee maker felt like a small but significant upgrade to my morning routine. With this pack of twelve charcoal water filters, I didn‚Äôt just brew coffee‚ÄîI brewed consistently better coffee. It transforms the flavor by removing unpleasant tastes and impurities that often sneak into tap water. Plus, the affordability of this specific bundle made me curious about its value compared to competing products. Here‚Äôs a closer look at how it performed in my daily trials.  

**The Design and Build Quality of These Filters**

At first glance, these filters impressed me with their clean, compact build and basket design. The activated charcoal material seemed perfect for filtering out impurities commonly found in tap water, like chlorine and calcium. The compact dimensions (1.87 x 0.87 x 1 inches) allowed me to quickly install each filter into my coffee maker without any hassle. They fit snugly into my Cuisinart machine, and unlike some off-brand options I've used previously, I didn‚Äôt have to wrestle with them to make them stay in place. It‚Äôs the kind of attention to detail in design that you appreciate after dealing with ill-fitting filters.

**Ease of Use and Installation**

Swapping out the water filter in my coffee machine used to be one of those dreaded chores I kept putting off. But with these filters, installation took less than a minute and required zero technical aptitude. I simply replaced the old filter with a new one, filled the reservoir, and was ready to brew. Even my partner, who usually avoids anything remotely tech-related, thought it was easy to manage. Instructions were clear, though honestly, the process was so intuitive I didn‚Äôt need them after the first time.  

[Check GoldTone TEK-cwf-12-gt price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b01iru2y9e/)  

**Performance and Water Filtration**

Testing these filters over a week, I could immediately taste the difference in my coffee. They effectively removed that slightly metallic tang, which I suspect came from our city‚Äôs chlorinated tap water. Beyond chlorine, the filters are designed to handle odors and other impurities, and this feature really stood out during my tests. My coffee had a cleaner, richer flavor that felt closer to what I‚Äôd expect from a high-end caf√©. While I didn‚Äôt measure lab-quality filtration, the taste improvement alone won me over.  

**Positives**

- Improves coffee flavor noticeably by removing water impurities.
- Comes in a well-priced one-year supply pack (totaling 12 filters).  
- Installs easily without needing detailed instructions or complex handling.  

**Downsides**

- No clear indicator for when the filter is no longer effective.  
- The filters are lightweight, making me wonder about their long-term durability.  

**How They Stack Against Other Alternatives**

Comparing these filters to other brands I‚Äôve tried in the past, including name-brand Cuisinart replacements, it‚Äôs clear where they shine. The balance between affordability and function makes them hard to beat. Some competitor brands feel overpriced for essentially the same activated charcoal material. On the flip side, I noticed that some cheaper filters drop the ball on fit and compatibility, often resulting in leaks or poor water flow. One notable rival is the Maxware set of filters, which boasts similar performance, though the installation was fussier and less seamless in my opinion.  

**Bang for the Buck**

Let‚Äôs talk value. With twelve pieces in this pack, it‚Äôs marketed as a one-year supply if you replace them monthly as recommended. Given the improved taste in my coffee and the simplicity of installation, I feel this bundle delivers excellent financial value. Other filters might cost more upfront without outshining in filtration quality, making this option a smarter move for those on a budget without being cheap on quality.

I'm new to espresso machines, I'm doing trial and errors since 1 week, and I already watched and read some tutorials. I bought and using this WDT from Amazon. I can't figure out how to stop channelling. I waste even a couple of minutes using the WDT in a circular motion, starting from bottom and going to the top, like every YouTube tutorial out there. 3 cups out of 4 spreads the coffee everywhere, and the 1 cup out of 4 isn't channelling, the espresso flows slower and come out perfectly.

At the moment I'm using a dosing ring and a normcore tamper with spring. The coffee is medium roast, done yesterday (05/08/2025) and received today (06/08/2025), so I'm trying to grind finer since it's super fresh (1 level out of 40 (0-5 should be espresso levels) with my hand-manual grinder, I'm waiting for the HiBREW G5, but at the moment I have to use this...).

Since I'm stupid and I cannot use the WDT correctly, I don't know what to do. Should I buy/3d-print a planetary WDT? Should I buy/3d-print a spreaded WDT?

Hey everyone, I‚Äôm curious about your timelines and experiences.

My background:

On Paxil 40 mg for years (initially for sexual dysfunction), tapered down to 5 mg by late June.

Started Pristiq 50 mg on May 29‚Äîonly felt better for about a week or two in mid-June after dropping Paxil to 10 mg.

On August 1 my Pristiq was increased to 100 mg.


Other changes:

Stopped beer, coffee, and nicotine in late July.

Taking magnesium at night and omega-3s in the morning.

Using breathing/vagus-nerve exercises and occasional Ativan for panic spikes.

Dealing with a breakup,  and working 55‚Äì60 hrs/week‚Äîstress is high.


What‚Äôs happening now:

I get short ‚Äúgood‚Äù windows (had a three-hour calm yesterday), but still daily 2‚Äì10 min panic/anxiety waves‚Äîmorning cortisol spikes, surges after meals/showers, and again in the evening.

Currently having trouble getting off the couch or out of bed, and have missed 3 days of work...

I‚Äôve been on Pristiq nearly 10 weeks (5 days at 100 mg) but haven‚Äôt stabilized.


My question:
For anyone who switched from Paxil to Pristiq (or another SNRI), how long did it take before you felt steadily better? Did upping to 100 mg help, or did you switch back to an SSRI? Any timelines or tips would be hugely appreciated. Thanks!

1mjdmp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelY/comments/1mjdmp7/license_plate_issues_in_texas/,License plate issues in Texas,"I bought a used 2023 model Y at the end of June that I thought was a great deal (until I found out I got an abandoned model with a ""special"" worse battery that will cost me over twice as much as a more common one to replace, FML for not knowing Tesla had hidden surprises like that), and Tesla gave me a temporary permit good for a month.  

The permit has since expired, and the day after it was no good, I spent a couple of hours between app chat and several calls (because it would lock me out and stop responding, making me start over) on their automated gatekeeper before I finally got through to a person.  When I finally did, they assured me it was a known issue and they had a procedure in place, and someone would be reaching out to me with more information.  

I figured it had to do with the fact that Texas changed away from giving temporary permits starting July 1, but the rep told me they were prepared for everything and that certainly wasn't the case, and everything would be handled shortly.

Apparently that was just a lie to get me to agree to hang up, because it's been a week with no contact at this point.  Now I have a car I can't drive without risking a $200 ticket, and I really don't have another 3 hours to spend fighting the patented Tesla customer hating AI.  Does anyone know of any way to get though to an actual person without wasting hours of time?

I thought I was buying a cheap car with no maintenance, I had no idea I was signing up for this kind of experience. Caveat emptor I guess.

Btw, while I'm making a post, does anyone have any advice on how early I should sell this one?  I'm thinking I need to get rid of it with at least 3 years left on the battery warranty because anyone who finds out the extra cost of replacing the battery on this special model only produced for 3 months will run like crazy.  I'm also worried about driving over some loose rocks and having to pay to replace it fully out of pocket like I've been reading about.

I figure my options are to either dump it early, or I buy a bunch of MAGA and DOGE stickers, park it by some independent coffee shop, and hope for some maniac to firebomb it.",0,1754507290.0,TeslaModelY,2,0.2,False

She was enthusiastic with sharing her experience. When it felt the travel topic was dry I asked about her week given her team is short handed, which she did not respond. Not sure whether this is a sign that she‚Äôs not interested or simply being treated like a colleague, if latter, how do I build a bond.

1mjdlft,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mjdlft/the_howl_in_the_pines/,The Howl in the Pines,"My old Ford pickup truck rattled along the uneven gravel road, and with every jolt, a shiver coursed through my body, setting my nerves on edge.

The fractured sunlight was filtered by the thick canopy of ancient pines, casting dappled patterns on the winding paths, while the forest faded in and out of light and shadow.

I found myself stranded in a small town named Blackwood, a name that felt like it belonged in a gothic novel.

My uncle Samuel resided here; he was my mother's reclusive brother, a man I had only seen during family funerals. He had sent me an unexpected invitation to spend some time with him following my recent... career setback.

""I've heard you've been going through some tough times, Ethan. Come and stay with me; your mother thought the peace might do you some good.""

My uncle's handwriting was spidery and precise, and calling it quiet was a significant understatement; this town felt like the edge of the world.

As I drove through the main part of Blackwood, it appeared to be little more than a collection of crumbling buildings and a dilapidated general store that seemed to have avoided a fresh coat of paint since the Great Depression.

As I passed by, I noticed a sign that read:

Welcome To Blackwood - Est. 1888. Naturally, there was no cell service, just the whispering trees and an overwhelming, oppressive silence.

I discovered that my uncle's house was a mile outside of town, tucked deep within the woods. As I navigated a long dirt driveway, I finally spotted the house.

It was a gaunt, two-story structure with a perpetually dark porch, resembling more of a horror movie set than a home.

I noticed my uncle Samuel standing on the front porch, waving at me.

His face was marked by years of sun and solitude, and his eyes seemed to harbor a bottomless well of secrets.

I parked the truck and let out a soft sigh before grabbing my bag, stepping out, and making my way to my uncle, who greeted me with a terse welcome and a firm handshake that felt like grasping a knot of old rope. He then offered to show me where I would be staying.

I trailed behind my uncle Samuel as he guided me through the house, sharing stories about the history of Blackwood and describing what the town was like.

Before long, we made our way upstairs, and he brought me to a room. When he opened the door, I peered inside, and my heart sank immediately.

Inside, there was just a bed, a drawer, a lamp for nighttime illumination, and a closet.

""My room is down the hall, and the bathroom is directly across from yours, so if you need to go during the night, you‚Äôll know where to find it,"" Uncle Samuel explained.

He then mentioned that I could unpack my belongings and that he would be downstairs preparing dinner since I was likely hungry after my ten-hour drive.

I simply didn‚Äôt want to bring it up.

As I entered the room with my bag, I placed it on the floor and let out a soft sigh before starting to unpack everything I had prepared for this dreadful stay.

I took my phone out of my pocket and rolled my eyes; it felt like I was carrying a useless hunk of metal or plastic since there was no cell service available.

Just as I was about to hurl my phone across the room, I heard Uncle Samuel calling for me to come downstairs for dinner.

I tossed my phone onto the bed and made my way downstairs to the dining room, where I noticed a large pot sitting next to a basket full of biscuits, and my uncle was at the table, smiling.

Soon, I joined him, and in front of me was a steaming bowl of venison stew, which I learned was just deer meat‚Äîsomething I didn‚Äôt know people actually ate.

We both sat there, just eating. I didn't feel like talking at all; I didn't even want to be there. This was all my uncle's and mom's idea.

Then Uncle Samuel cleared his throat, which made me glance at him with a suspicious expression.

""You might not be aware, but animals have been acting strangely lately. For the past couple of weeks, Mr. Hemlock's sheep were killed, likely by wolves. We have them around here quite often,"" Uncle Samuel explained.

I remained silent about it, continuing to eat while trying to appear concerned, even though I wasn't particularly worried. The thought of wild wolves didn't intrigue me; I was from the city, after all, but what did I know?

A week passed in a blur of forced politeness and discomfort because Uncle Samuel is a man of few words. He often vanishes into the woods behind the house and returns late, smelling of earth and something else... wild and musky.

At night, the forest comes alive with sounds I can't identify‚Äîtwigs snapping, the rustling of unseen creatures, and then the loud howling.

It was a deep, resonant sound that didn't resemble a coyote or a dog; it was too... powerful.

Whenever I brought it up, without even glancing up from his book or diverting his attention from whatever he was doing, my uncle would say,¬†

""That's just the wind, Ethan.""

One day, I decided to take a walk since it was the only thing to do, and I heard whispers around town. Not only had the livestock been killed, but Mrs. Gabriel's prize-winning dog was found torn apart near the creek.

I was chatting with old Mr. Hemlock, the only resident I had managed to converse with, and I noticed his eyes were wide and filled with fear when I recounted what had happened.

""It wasn't wolves; it was too clean, too brutal, and the tracks near the body..."" Mr. Hemlock trailed off, shaking his head.

After my conversation with Mr. Hemlock, I felt compelled to head down to the creek, driven by a dark curiosity. I recalled the path Uncle Samuel had taken me on during our fishing trips.

Upon arrival, the creek appeared ordinary at first glance, but then I spotted it‚ÄîMrs. Gabriel's dog, or what was left of it. The area surrounding its remains looked disturbed, as if it had fought against something before its demise.

Before long, I stumbled upon the tracks Mr. Hemlock had mentioned. They were massive, far too large for any typical wolf or coyote I had encountered.

What was even more unsettling was that the tracks bore a resemblance to a human footprint, albeit mixed with distinct claw marks, sending chills down my spine.

When I recounted the events to Uncle Samuel, he became increasingly restless. He would pace the house at night, and I often heard him muttering to himself from his bedroom while I was in mine.

Eventually, he began leaving the house earlier in the evening, returning well past midnight. I noticed that his eyes seemed to glow faintly in the dim light whenever he came back.

One morning, I woke up, stretched, and made my way downstairs. The aroma of coffee filled the air, but there was no sign of Uncle Samuel.

As I entered the kitchen, I realized he was absent, but I found a note on the counter. It stated that Uncle Samuel had gone to the small store to pick up a few items.

I also noticed the morning newspaper lying on the counter and decided to check the news from Blackwood.

The headline reported that, following a series of mysterious animal deaths, the first human victim had emerged: Jedediah Miller, a well-known local trapper with a notorious temper and a penchant for whiskey, had vanished while hunting for deer the previous night.

Two days later, the entire town assembled in the square to discuss Jedediah. Armed with hunting rifles, I felt compelled to assist them.

This was despite Uncle Samuel's warnings to stay close to home, as the woods remained perilous.

However, I was determined to help the town search for that man, and on the third day of our search for Jedediah, we finally located him. A small group of us pushed through some bushes, and there he lay.

Or rather, what was left of him, as his body was so mangled that it was unrecognizable. The sight of Jedediah's remains made my stomach churn.

Some of the women screamed or gasped in horror, and I had to step away, battling the nausea rising in my throat. It appeared as if something or someone had thrown him into a meat grinder.

Following that, the entire town of Blackwood descended into chaos, and a curfew was enforced. No one dared to venture out after dark, and fear loomed in the air like a toxic cloud.

We convened at the general store with the local police and sheriff, a man who always seemed overwhelmed.

""We examined all the clues and scrutinized the body for evidence, concluding it was a rogue grizzly bear that must have come down from the mountains to attack Jedediah,"" the sheriff informed everyone.

Instantly, no one accepted his explanation. The tracks discovered near Jedediah‚Äôs remains were unlike any bear prints. They were larger, with longer toes, and there was always that unsettling impression of a bare, splayed foot, resembling the tracks I had seen when I encountered Mrs. Gabriel's dog.

A month later, I found myself still in Blackwood, but a tight knot of suspicion was forming in my stomach regarding my Uncle Samuel's odd behavior. He would leave at night despite the curfew, and there was that unsettling smell, along with the almost animalistic intensity in his eyes. And those dreadful howls.

Out of the blue, I decided to dig deeper into what was happening, so I hurried back to that dreadful crime scene where the man's body had been discovered, hoping to uncover more clues.

Upon my arrival, I saw Mr. Hemlock standing there, and I realized that Jedediah's body was missing‚Äîperhaps they had taken it away to search for additional evidence.

However, all the peculiar tracks remained, and when the old man spotted me, he turned around abruptly as if I had caught him in a wrongdoing.

""The creature that attacked Jedediah wasn‚Äôt a bear or a wolf,"" Mr. Hemlock stated quietly.

I stared at him in confusion, crossing my arms, feeling as if this man's mind had just shattered like a nut.

""Then what happened to him?"" I inquired.

""I know it sounds insane, and I‚Äôve been sharing this with people for years, but it was a werewolf that killed my sheep. I‚Äôve told everyone, and they just think I‚Äôve lost my mind,"" Mr. Hemlock mumbled.

My jaw dropped in disbelief and astonishment; I felt like laughing, but I didn‚Äôt want to offend the man, so I pressed on with more questions about the entire situation.

""When you mention werewolf, are you referring to those large, muscular creatures that are actually humans who transform during a full moon?"" I asked him.

""Well, actually, young man, while it is true that a werewolf can change during a full moon, they can also transform on any night if their primal instincts overpower their human nature. It‚Äôs the books and movies that lead you to believe it‚Äôs only during a full moon that werewolves change,"" Mr. Hemlock clarified.

I then asked if there was a way to identify a werewolf and if there was a method to stop them, but Mr. Hemlock simply shook his head in response.

""Hey, what on earth are you two doing near this crime scene?!"" a voice yelled at us.

I turned around to see the town sheriff approaching, with a police officer trailing behind him, both looking quite displeased.

""Remember during the meeting when we mentioned it wasn't a bear? I'm telling you, a werewolf is responsible for this, Brody, and we both know it!"" Mr. Hemlock shouted.

""Oh my God, not this again! I told you, Mr. Hemlock, your werewolf tale is nearly as absurd as my bear story. And what are you doing here, young man?"" the sheriff asked, directing his gaze at me.

I explained that I had returned to the crime scene to search for clues to understand what was happening in this town, and then I realized I had something else to add.

""Look, sir, the tracks found near Jedediah's body are identical to those I discovered near the animal's body, and I believe they were both attacked by the same creature,"" I explained.

The sheriff raised his hand, remaining silent as he glanced at the police officer, who stepped forward, cleared his throat, and looked at me and Mr. Hemlock.

""I regret to inform you that if you two do not vacate this crime scene immediately, I will have to arrest you both,"" he stated.

""Arrest me? I haven't done anything wrong!"" Mr. Hemlock shouted in frustration.

I quickly nodded and said my goodbyes; I was here to visit and spend time with my Uncle Samuel, not to end up in jail in Blackwood, which even had a jail.

As I started walking back to town, I could hear Mr. Hemlock arguing with the sheriff and the police officer; it seemed he was determined to convince someone else of his werewolf story.

When I returned home, Uncle Samuel was in the living room engrossed in a book. As I entered through the front door, he glanced up and noticed the anxiety on my face.

""What happened?"" he inquired.

""I revisited the crime scene of the man who was attacked to search for clues and encountered Mr. Hemlock, the man whose sheep were killed. He shared a lengthy story with me, and then the sheriff arrived with the police, and we nearly got arrested,"" I recounted.

As soon as I finished speaking, Uncle Samuel slammed his book down, and it was clear he was displeased with my revelation.

""I thought I instructed you to stay near the house and avoid the woods. I don‚Äôt want those wolves and other dreadful creatures after you. I certainly don‚Äôt want to have to send you back to your mother in a police evidence box,"" Uncle Samuel admonished.

""Then stop deceiving me and tell me what truly killed those animals and that man. If it wasn‚Äôt a bear, as the sheriff claimed, then what could it possibly be?"" I retorted.

""I‚Äôve already told you it was likely wolves or coyotes; they‚Äôre prevalent in this area. Now go upstairs and prepare for dinner,"" Uncle Samuel said as he picked up his book.

I opened my mouth to protest, but Uncle Samuel pointed toward the stairs, prompting me to mutter a curse under my breath. Nevertheless, I complied with his request.

Then one night, I could no longer tolerate my Uncle Samuel's peculiar actions, so I waited until he slipped out of the back door and quietly followed him.

As I gazed up at the night sky, I noticed the moon was fully illuminated and had a silver hue, casting a brighter light over the forest, yet creating a maze of ancient shadows.

I moved as swiftly and silently as possible, my heartbeat pounding in my ears as I trailed Uncle Samuel's footsteps.

We ventured deeper into the woods than I had ever gone before, passing by gnarled trees and pushing through thick underbrush. After an hour of walking, I spotted a clearing ahead.

With the full moon shining unobstructed, its light poured down into the clearing, so I crept closer, concealing myself behind a massive oak tree.

What I witnessed made my breath hitch in my throat; standing in the center of the moonlight was Uncle Samuel... but he was not quite Uncle Samuel.

Uncle Samuel was undergoing a transformation. I noticed his clothes lying on the ground like discarded rags, and I observed as his skin stretched and tore, becoming covered in coarse, dark fur.

With every movement, his bones shifted with a sickening crack, his limbs elongated, and his hands morphed into claws. His face twisted grotesquely, the mouth evolving into a ravenous maw, while his eyes glowed with an unnatural intensity.

He gazed up at the sky, and the howl that erupted from his throat sent chills down my spine. Then came another sound, one of raw power and insatiable hunger, which chilled me to my very core.

Those were the howls I had been hearing each night, the very sounds Uncle Samuel had dismissed as mere coyotes. But it was clear now; he was a creature of the night, a werewolf and I sickly realized that Mr. Hemlock was right a werewolf had killed all of those animals and that innocent man.

I stumbled backward, tripping over a tree root, and a terrified noise escaped my lips. Before I could react, the werewolf form of my Uncle Samuel's alter ego froze in place.

It began to sniff the air, then suddenly turned its head in my direction; it had heard me.

Panic surged through me as I scrambled to my feet and fled in blind terror, crashing through the underbrush, branches clawing at my face.

But I could hear the werewolf, my Uncle Samuel, pursuing me, its heavy paws pounding the ground and its ragged snarls echoing behind me.

I kept running until my lungs felt like they were on fire, and my legs threatened to give out. I had to reach the house; that was my only hope.

I finally arrived at Uncle Samuel's house and burst through the door. I slammed it shut behind me, fumbled with the lock, and leaned against the door, breathing heavily as tears streamed down my face.

My Uncle Samuel was a monster; the man who had invited me to stay here in Blackwood was a killer.

A low growl resonated through the floorboards. He was outside. I could hear him pacing, his heavy breaths, and the occasional scratching of claws against the wood of the porch.

""Uncle Samuel, what have you done to Blackwood?!"" I shouted, my voice cracking with fear.

I heard his growl intensifying, then a low, deep, guttural voice rumbled from behind the door, stretched and distorted.

""What I've done, no Ethan, my boy, it is what must be done,"" Uncle Samuel said in that deep, guttural tone.

Suddenly, there was a violent crash against the door that made me jump back in terror; the wood was splintering as he tried to break in.

I scanned the room, desperately searching for a way out, but there was no escape, and all the windows were too small to climb through.

Another crash, and the door burst inward, ripped from its hinges. In the doorway stood the werewolf, with dark black fur, massive claws, and eyes glowing with a primal light. It wasn‚Äôt my Uncle Samuel; it was a nightmare.

The werewolf crawled towards me on all fours, moving slowly, its drooling mouth opening just wide enough for me to glimpse a row of razor-sharp teeth.

My heart raced in my chest, a frantic beat against my ribs. I seized a fire poker, the nearest object and my only means of defense, but my hands shook uncontrollably.

""Uncle Samuel, please,"" I begged him freaking out for my life.

The werewolf halted a few feet away from me. Its head tilted as if it were listening. Then, slowly and horrifyingly, the transformation began to reverse.

The dark fur vanished, the limbs shrank back, and the monstrous face contorted into the familiar, gaunt features of my uncle Samuel.

He collapsed to the ground, clad only in boxing shorts, panting heavily, sweat glistening on his pale skin.

""Ethan, I'm sorry, but I tried to prepare you,"" he gasped in a faint voice.

Uncle Samuel looked up at me, his eyes still holding a hint of that wild glow as they locked onto mine.

""Prepare me for what?"" I inquired, still gripping the fire poker as if it were a protective barrier.

Uncle Samuel pushed himself off the ground, leaning against the wall, panting heavily, blood smeared across his face and body.

""The curse, Ethan, is part of our bloodline, coursing through every male in our family. I inherited it from your grandfather, and now... it‚Äôs your turn,"" Uncle Samuel revealed.

""No - no, that‚Äôs absurd,"" I gasped, my heart racing.

""That‚Äôs the reason I brought you here. It‚Äôs why the attacks started. The beast‚Ä¶ it craves sustenance. It needed to be awakened within you. I wasn‚Äôt merely killing out of hunger, Ethan. I was paving the way. Weakening the town. Making it simpler for you when the transformation arrives; it was time for the transfer. For you to assume the mantle,"" Uncle Samuel clarified.

Suddenly, he coughed, a wet, rattling noise, and then he expelled blood and black sludge onto the floor.

I stared at Uncle Samuel, my mind spinning. The attacks. The fear. Everything was a distorted rite of passage.

Then, an intense, blinding pain surged through my left arm. I screamed, dropping the lamp. My muscles convulsed, bones grinding against each other.

My skin felt taut, stretched, as if something was trying to break free from inside. A wave of heat engulfed me, followed by a bone-chilling cold that made my teeth chatter.

I glanced down at my hand. It was transforming. My fingers grew longer, thickening, nails extending and hardening into dark, sharp claws. Coarse, dark hair began to sprout from the back of my hand, rapidly spreading up my arm.

Uncle Samuel merely observed me, a grim, knowing expression in his eyes, yet there was also a fleeting sense of relief.

""It's beginning; you'll feel it in your bones‚Äîthe hunger. The power. Now you must embrace it, Ethan; you are no longer merely a man,"" Uncle Samuel murmured, a faint, almost satisfied smile gracing his lips.

Uncle Samuel grinned at me while I clutched my chest, feeling sweat trickle down my forehead, and goosebumps prickled my skin. The sensation coursing through me was unlike any pain I had ever experienced before.

Before long, the agony intensified, spreading throughout my whole body, tearing at me, and I shut my eyes, squeezing them shut tightly.

A deep, guttural growl erupted from my throat, a sound so alien to me.

Suddenly, my senses sharpened; I could detect the scent of pine trees and the moist earth flooding my nostrils with startling clarity.

The distant rustling of the trees and the calls of nocturnal creatures resonated like a roar, nearly causing my eardrums to burst.

My teeth began to throb and twist painfully as my new predatory fangs forced their way through my gums.

And then, all at once, the pain ceased. When I reopened my eyes, I scanned my surroundings and realized that the world looked sharper, with colors that were more vibrant than ever.

I turned my gaze to Uncle Samuel and for the first time, I perceived him not as a beaten old man, but as a fellow predator, finally free from his chains.

Next, I caught sight of my altered hands, with clawed fingers and the rough, dark black fur that was beginning to cover my body, and I felt a rush of excitement.

Let's just say that folks began to realize that twice as many animals were being slaughtered, and even more individuals who ventured into the woods at night after curfew were turning up just like Jedediah.

The howling was now even louder and more ferocious than before, and this time it was much closer to the town of Blackwood.

But now, it wasn‚Äôt my Uncle Samuel who was howling or taking lives anymore; it was me.

For the first time in my life, I found it hard to tell whether it was devastating or incredible that I could now pursue something different with my existence.

I've had a 2 quart County Line Kitchen mason jar with strainer for a couple months now and buying bags of coffee that a local shop would grind for me (sometimes they wouldn't do course and it would be way too fine, but that's besides the point) I finally invested in a OXO coffee grinder so I could grind my own beans.

My questions is.. I''ve been putting 2 cups of course coffee grinds in the mesh strainer and then filling with water up to the 8 cup mark, shake back and forth and then let it sit for 24 hours in the fridge (I also shake half through at 12 hour mark). Afterwards, I take the strainer out, clean the lid etc and dilute with water up to the 8 cup mark. Before this, I believe the cold brew itself would only be up to maybe around the 6 cup mark. Is this too much water to dilute with? Should I not be diluting at all? I've noticed that it doesn't seem as strong as other cold brews I'd get while out (like at Starbucks for example) and it also rarely gets my bowels going lol - whereas Starbucks cold brew helps with that. Would kind of suck because diluting makes 8 cups for the week (5 days) and I pour 1 and 1/2 cups every morning for my coffee as well adding some cream, sugar and ice.

For beans, I usually get medium roast.

## FAQs Section

**How do I choose the right size cushions for my rocking chair?**
measure the seat and backrest of your rocking chair carefully.Note the width,depth,and height. Compare these measurements to the dimensions provided by the cushion manufacturer. It is best to choose cushions that are slightly smaller than your measurements to ensure a snug fit without overhang.

**What is the best way to clean outdoor rocking chair cushions?**
Start by brushing off any loose dirt or debris. For minor stains, spot clean with mild soap and water, using a soft cloth.If the cushions have removable covers, check the manufacturer's instructions for machine washing. Always air dry the cushions to prevent shrinking or damage.**How can I protect my outdoor cushions from fading and water damage?**
Choose cushions made from fabrics with UV protection and water resistance,such as solution-dyed acrylic or polyester with a water-repellent coating. When not in use, store the cushions in a dry, sheltered location to minimize exposure to the elements. Consider using a furniture cover to protect the cushions during periods of heavy rain or prolonged sun exposure.

**What type of filling is best for outdoor rocking chair cushions?**
High-density foam is a good choice as it provides excellent support and retains its shape over time. However, it can be more expensive. Fiberfill is another option and provides a plusher feel, but it may flatten over time. Consider the level of comfort and support you desire and the frequency of use when making your decision.

1mjdg08,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1mjdg08/aita_for_getting_pregnant_with_my_husbands_best/,AITA for getting pregnant with my husband's best friend's baby and then discovering my husband lied about everything?,"My world fell apart three months ago and i still don't know if what i did was right.

My husband and i had been trying for a baby for two years. Nothing worked. The doctors ran every test imaginable and kept saying everything looked normal. But month after month, nothing happened.

Last year my husband suggested we look into sperm donation. He said maybe the problem was with him even though his tests came back fine. He showed me this profile on a donor website. Young guy, college athlete, looked a lot like my husband actually. Same height, same build, same dark hair.

""This could work,"" he said. ""The kid would look like it could be ours.""

But the clinic visits were expensive and our insurance wouldn't cover it. My husband kept pushing back the appointments. Always some excuse about work or money or timing.

Then i found out something that changed everything.

The donor profile my husband showed me? It wasn't some random guy from the sperm bank. It was his best friend from college. Same guy who comes to our barbecues every summer. Same guy who was the best man at our wedding.

i found the real profile on my husband's laptop. Complete with photos and personal details that matched perfectly. My husband had been showing me his friend's information this whole time.

So i did something crazy. i called the friend directly.

""Did you donate sperm?"" i asked him.

Long pause. Then he admitted my husband had asked him to do it privately. Skip the clinic. Save money. Just the three of us handling everything.

But here's where it gets weird. My husband had never told his friend that i knew about any of this. The friend thought it was all happening behind my back.

""Wait,"" he said. ""You know about this? He told me you'd never agree to it.""

That's when i realized my husband was playing us both.

The friend and i met for coffee. We figured out that my husband had been lying to both of us for months. Telling me we'd use the clinic eventually. Telling his friend that i was okay with the private arrangement but wanted to pretend i didn't know.

""Screw this,"" the friend said. ""If you want a baby and he's being shady about it, let's just do this ourselves.""

So we did. Three times over two months. No clinic. No my husband knowing. Just us trying to make a baby while my husband kept making excuses about scheduling donor appointments.

i got pregnant on the second try.

When i told my husband, he was over the moon. Started planning the nursery immediately. Talking about how the baby might have his eyes or my nose.

But then his family started asking questions. His mom kept saying the baby looked nothing like either of us in the ultrasound photos. His sister made comments about how fast it happened after two years of trying.

So my husband suggested a paternity test. Just to shut everyone up, he said.

The results came back last week.

Not only was the baby not his. The test showed he couldn't be the father of any baby. Ever.

Turns out he'd been sterile since a military training accident in his early twenties. Years before we even met. He'd known the whole time we were trying that it was impossible.

The clinic visits, the donor profiles, the excuses about money. All of it was just him buying time while he figured out how to get me pregnant without admitting he'd been lying about being able to have kids.

When i confronted him with the test results, everything came out. He'd been planning to have his friend get me pregnant and then pretend the baby was ours. But he was scared to tell either of us the real plan because he thought we'd both refuse.

""i just wanted us to have a family,"" he cried. ""i didn't know how to tell you i couldn't give you that.""

His friend is furious. Says my husband manipulated both of us. Wants to be involved in raising the baby now that everything's out in the open.

My husband's family is calling me horrible names. Saying i cheated and ruined their son's life. They don't care that he lied about being sterile or that he was setting up the whole donor situation anyway.

My own parents think i should have just waited for my husband to figure out how to tell me the truth. They say going behind his back was wrong even if he was going behind mine.

But i don't see it that way. If i'd waited, i'd still be sitting here thinking we were working toward some clinic appointment that was never going to happen. My husband had two years to tell me he was sterile. Instead he let me think something was wrong with me while he cooked up this elaborate plan.

Now we're getting divorced. i'm having a baby with his ex-best friend. And everyone thinks i'm the villain in this story.

So reddit, AITA here? Or was my husband the one who screwed everything up by lying about something this big?

- two heaping teaspoons of [unflavoured Metamucil](https://www.metamucil.com/en-us/products/fiber-powders/metamucil-unflavored-fiber-powder) but any psylium husk fibre powder should work the same


The Biosteel tastes good and gives me the electrolytes I need. The Metamucil forms a bit of a gel that is very filling and full of of good fibre that keep things moving :) It also forces me to drink more water during the day when I normally only remember to drink black coffee.

I‚Äôm MTRR A66G +/+, ACAT1 +/+, MAO-A +/+, and COMT V158M +/-. 

For context, my main MTHFR genes were -/-, but Genetics Genie still told me that my MTHFR is affected by the other variants I do have above.  From what I‚Äôve read, that likely means I don‚Äôt recycle B12 well, may have sluggish fat metabolism and mitochondria, and might be more sensitive to neurotransmitter buildup or overstimulation.

Some background: I‚Äôve been sober from alcohol for a little over four years, and while the first 2‚Äì3 years felt great, consistent energy, productive, solid gym and food habits. However, things started to shift in the last year or so. I was drinking more caffeine (sometimes up to 600mg/day) mostly through zero sugar energy drinks, and I started noticing more anxiety, OCD-like thought loops, and brain fog, even when I lowered it to just one can a day. Around the same time, my diet slipped with more binge/restrict cycles, and I‚Äôve had days where I feel lightheaded, foggy, and off despite hitting my macros. It‚Äôs worth noting that despite the fact I‚Äôve been consuming a good amount of caffeine for years, I didn‚Äôt really ever have energy drinks until a couple years ago. I preferred cheap and simpler forms. Coffee was a regular one, but even Crystal Light and pills are strictly caffeine, no added B vitamins.

Looking at my Cronometer logs, I realized I‚Äôve been getting a ton of B vitamins, but mostly from synthetic sources like energy drinks and fortified snacks. I‚Äôm now wondering if all those synthetic forms (like cyanocobalamin and pyridoxine HCl) have been doing more harm than good, especially with my MTRR and MAO-A genes. 

I‚Äôve recently decided to make a diet change and move toward food-based nutrients (eggs, beef, spinach, sardines, etc.), but I‚Äôm curious if anyone else here with similar variants has had issues with synthetic Bs, or found specific forms, foods, or routines that made a real difference.

I may just be using too many stimulants due to working at Starbucks, but I've been completely fine all day today (Day 6, took it at 6:10am) up until now (2:45pm) where I feel like my brain is completely fogged up but also a bit pressuring.

I'm a trainer and have done 2 coffee tastings with our new partner, a blonde roast of 6oz and a dark roast of 6oz, and have drank a bit of green tea...

‚ÄúNo. The boys and I were just about to head out actually. Thanks.‚Äù I said, reaching for the carefully wrapped and unusually large lunch bag. I looked back up at her in question and she looked away, a light blush dusting her fair cheeks.

‚ÄúI *may* have gone a little overboard. I was trying out that new recipe Jess sent me yesterday and made a *little* bit too much. I hope the boys won't mind eating in?‚Äù She said almost bashfully and I couldn't help the warmth that pooled in my chest. 

‚ÄúI'm sure they'll love it. Heck, you just saved Jerry from a lost bet.‚Äù I said with a laugh, already imagining his relieved face.

‚ÄúWell, tell him he's welcome then.‚Äù She said, turning around. ‚ÄúI'll be back in time to make you breakfast. Call me before bed, alright?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWill do. Love you.‚Äù I called out and watched her wave back at me without turning, not missing the ‚Äòlove you too‚Äô she muttered.

Just when her figure was out of sight, the boys came up behind me. 

‚ÄúWas that the missus?‚Äù Michael asked and I nodded, very much aware of the stupid smile on my face.

‚ÄúShe brought us lunch~‚Äù I said and could see them all peck up. Jerry in particular looked like he could cry from joy.

‚ÄúDamien, tell her she's heaven sent. You guys are assholes.‚Äù He said playfully glaring at us. The boys just shrugged, not at all sorry.

‚ÄúIt was a fair bet. You're just a sore loser.‚Äù Connor jabbed and received the fingers from Jerry in return. It made everyone laugh.

‚ÄúCome on, we'll end up spending lunch bickering instead of actually eating.‚Äù I said and proceeded to walk out of the office. 

I didn't get home until after eight. We ended up going out to eat and had a few drinks after leaving the office. I'm not one to go drinking on a Wednesday night but the thought of having dinner alone didn't seem particularly appealing either so I curved without much coaxing. 

I'd received a series of pictures of Mia, Emma and the baby doing various things halfway through dinner, the most noticeable being the mess in the kitchen. Baking gone sideways I could only assume. Little Jayden was covered almost entirely in flour and chocolate dough. It was beyond amusing.

I let myself into the apartment when I got home and went about my usual routine, taking a warm, relaxing shower before making my way into the comfort of bed, coffee on the bedside table and a book in hand.

It was just a little past nine when I next glanced up at the clock on the wall. I put my book aside, left open to the page I was reading. I wouldn't go to bed for another hour at most but it was getting late so I'd better call Mia now.

I reached for my phone on the bedside table and sat back as I watched it ring. It connected before long. 

‚ÄúHey baby.‚Äù Amelia‚Äôs voice said, sounding cheerful.

‚ÄúHm, with how much fun you seem to be having, it's almost like you'd forgotten about me.‚Äù I teased, an exaggerated pout in my voice. She laughed.

‚ÄúDon't be silly. You know I was waiting for your call.‚Äù I hummed in content then asked.

‚ÄúHow's Emma?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe's alright. She's happy, or at least seems to be.‚Äù She said, her tone turning a bit sombre.

‚ÄúWell, that's good then. And the baby?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe's alright. Making a good recovery. He was even running around earlier, caused a huge mess. You should have seen the look on Emma's face‚Ä¶‚Äù she said, and I hummed in acknowledgement. A moment of stretched silence passed between us.

‚ÄúYou can ask, you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid she say anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe knows where he is but‚Ä¶she doesn't want to move. Says the good memories here outweigh the bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that really okay?‚Äù I asked, a frown tugging at my mouth. 

‚ÄúWell, she's dead set on it so there's no talking her out of it. She assured me that she'd file for a restraining order though.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill it be enough?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt has to be. It's the most that can be done for her. She doesn't think he'll be back. She thinks it's over, that he's leaving for good this time so she only agreed to this as a precautionary measure, for my sake more than hers. I can't convince her of anything else so it'll have to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, let her know that she always has a place in our home if need be.‚Äù I said with a sigh.

‚ÄúI will.‚Äù She said, another beat of silence before she asked. ‚ÄúHow was work?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, do I have a story for you! The boys-‚Äù I began when I heard Emma calling for her in the back. 

‚ÄúBabe-‚Äù

‚ÄúGo, it's okay. I'll tell you over breakfast.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright then. Thank you. I love you. Have a good night.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou too, darling. I'll see you tomorrow.‚Äù I said, blowing her a virtual kiss then disconnecting the call. 

My mood felt heavy at the thought of Emma's situation but I put it out of mind, picking up my book again. Mia was there for her. That's what matters. 

I turned my attention back to my book and let the time slip away.

We‚Äôre not trying to cram everything in. We want fewer things done well.

What we‚Äôre looking for:

A. Luxury and comfort ‚Äî boutique hotels, private villas, or Airbnbs with charm, views, and strong AC. 5‚Äì7 star hotels are great too. We want to be wowed.

B. Local culture ‚Äî cooking classes, food tours, art/craft workshops, traditional performances, low-key street food, and slow mornings with strong coffee.

C. Private drivers or guides ‚Äî no packed buses or chaotic group tours. We want control over pace and quality.

D. Experience over itinerary ‚Äî happy to spend on what matters: great food, calm scenery, handmade things, and a few moments that stick. No interest in rushing through 12 cities in 10 days.

Bonus if you know:
	1.	Great spas, tailors, or local artisans worth visiting
	2.	Cooking hosts or home-dinner setups with real people, not just tourist packages

Would love tips on where to base ourselves, what‚Äôs worth the effort, and what‚Äôs safe to skip. Appreciate all suggestions.

The U.S. Open is throwing money around like it‚Äôs *trying* to make up for the fact that Arthur Ashe Stadium looks like it was designed by a toddler with a crayon. The USTA just announced a record $85 million in prize money, including a cool $5 million for the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs singles champions‚Äîbecause nothing says ‚Äúprogress‚Äù like giving both genders the same amount of money (finally, right?). That‚Äôs a 39% jump from last year‚Äôs paltry $3.6 million, which is basically the tennis equivalent of upgrading from a hot dog to a steak‚Ä¶ if the steak was still served in a hot dog bun. Meanwhile, the USTA is also shelling out $800 million to renovate Arthur Ashe Stadium. Let‚Äôs hope the new digs include a ‚Äúquiet zone‚Äù for players who want to avoid hearing the sound of their own thoughts.  

Over in cricket, the ICC Women‚Äôs Player of the Month award for July 2025 is a three-way battle between Sophia Dunkley (who scored 126 runs against India while looking like she was just there for a coffee break), Sophie Ecclestone (who took four wickets in T20Is and 3-27 in an ODI‚Äîbecause why settle for one format?), and Gaby Lewis (who hit 154 runs in three T20Is and led Ireland to wins like she‚Äôs the sport‚Äôs version of a Google Maps voice saying, ‚ÄúRecalculating‚Ä¶ no, really, this time!‚Äù). The articles about these nominees are so repetitive, I‚Äôm 90% sure they copied and pasted the same paragraphs and just changed the names.  

Pakistan‚Äôs cricket board is also flexing its newfound generosity by giving women players a 50% raise in retainers‚Äîbecause they hadn‚Äôt already paid them in rupees, but maybe in emotional support or the promise of a better tomorrow. Sadia Iqbal, the No. 1 T20I bowler, now gets a ‚ÄúCategory A‚Äù contract, while the PCB also created a new ‚ÄúEmerging‚Äù category for players like Eyman Fatima and Shawaal Zulfiqar. Let‚Äôs hope the PCB‚Äôs financial commitment translates to actual trophies instead of just contracts with more letters than sense.  

In conclusion: Tennis players are getting richer, cricketers are getting more chances to flex their stats, and the world is one step closer to figuring out how to spend money on women‚Äôs sports without making it feel like an afterthought. But hey, at least Arthur Ashe Stadium won‚Äôt look like it was built by a committee of pigeons anymore. *Fingers crossed.* üéæüèè",1,1754505734.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

Not wide. Not fake. Just‚Ä¶ approachable.

You shook my hand once, maybe. Maybe I helped you carry groceries. Maybe I watched your child cross the street to make sure she made it safely. You forgot me immediately, because I wasn‚Äôt meant to be remembered. That‚Äôs the trick, you know. You don‚Äôt kill in the light. You kill in the quiet. In the silence between the cracks.

‚ÄúTHE FIRST‚Äù

Her name was Dana. That‚Äôs a lie, but let‚Äôs pretend it‚Äôs the truth.

I didn‚Äôt choose her because of hate. There was no lust. No rage. No childhood trauma lit a fire in my belly. I chose her because I could.

She walked the same route every Tuesday‚ÄîElm Street, 6:17 PM. A plastic bag with two bananas and a diet soda. She walked fast, like she didn‚Äôt trust the dark. That amused me.

The first time wasn‚Äôt sloppy. People think serial killers mess up their first. Not me. I rehearsed. I spent weeks preparing: gloves, no fibers, no DNA. I left her body in an alley behind a Salvation Army drop box. The news said she was likely mugged.

I watched the candlelight vigil from my car. Her mother sobbed. A stranger read a poem.

I felt nothing. But I did feel the silence afterward. That heavy pause when no one knows what to say.

I liked that part most.

‚ÄúPATTERNS‚Äù

They tried to make me into a pattern. The FBI loves its profiles. They draw lines between the dead like constellations, hoping to make meaning. They saw only what I let them.

Four men. Three women. One child.

Different races. Different ages. Different zip codes. That wasn‚Äôt randomness. That was art.

The child haunts people the most. ‚ÄúHow could he?‚Äù they ask.
The truth is, he was already hollow. I didn‚Äôt kill him. I just‚Ä¶ completed something already broken.

‚ÄúCONFESSION‚Äù

You‚Äôre reading this because I want you to.
Not because I was caught.

No fingerprints. No cameras. No witnesses. I even moved cities halfway through just to test myself. No one noticed. I lived two years next to a police officer and helped fix his fence.

I‚Äôm writing this because I‚Äôm tired of the silence.

Not the silence in the world. The silence in me.

They call it a void. It‚Äôs not. A void implies emptiness. This is worse. This is a noise that no one hears but me, a constant hum, like a wire vibrating in the walls of my mind. Every kill was a way to tune it. To hush it. And it worked‚Ä¶ for a little while.

But now? I‚Äôm writing these words and I feel it again. That high-pitched whine. It wants more. And I‚Äôm getting old.

So I‚Äôll leave this behind. A breadcrumb trail. A final game. If you‚Äôre clever, maybe you‚Äôll find the names. Maybe you‚Äôll connect the cracks. Maybe you‚Äôll start to see me.

Or maybe you‚Äôll forget.

Just like they all did.

‚ÄúTHE GARDEN‚Äù

There‚Äôs a spot in my backyard where the soil grows rich and dark. Things grow well there.

I planted roses over the first. Lilies over the second. For the child, nothing. Just grass. Let the wind speak for him.

I sit there sometimes. In the early morning. Coffee in hand. And I listen.

Have Others Had Similar Experiences?,"I'm astounded that the modern poor person is so different than the generation of poor people I was part off.  Maybe something has changed and if so what?

I've managed to escape (thanks to education), but when I try to help and pass along what helped me when I was poor, I'm gobsmacked by the response I receive. Here are just a few examples, but there are many over a sustained period. Please don't dismiss them as isolated bad apple situations; they seem to be quite common.

1) Sense of entitlement and demanding a lot. For example, if I'm buying a Starbucks coffee and there is a homeless person nearby, I'll offer to buy them one. People have done this to me, and I greatly appreciated it. It showed me that people cared and I wasn't invisible; But I always ordered the cheapest item and the smallest size. However, in quite a few situations where I offered to buy coffee, the person orders the most expensive item and asks for two of them!  
  
2) Unwilling to listen. I was always grateful for people giving me ""stuff"", but what really helped me was advice not all of it was relevant but I listened. For example, some good advice I got was get an education. But when I offer basic advice I get this ""who do you think you are telling me what to do"" style vibe. It's weird because let's be clear, if you're homeless you need advice to help you.

3) Consistently blaming others. This is a huge difference. When my family was poor, we never blamed others for us getting poor or staying poor. But now after I offer some advice, I often get a stream of sob-story about the most silly reasons for being poor. If you have a chronic health problem, that's a great reason, but if your dog died and your heart broken and can't work ... Really? Toughen up!",0,1754505362.0,poor,32,0.31,False

Disclaimer- I usually dislike lush perfumes, and planned to return at least 3/5 I purchased. This has not been a fun day for my wallet. 


 Lord of Misrule: pulls extremely vanilla, sweet but not sugared. I would not ever pick out pepper as a note in this, but it definitely does make my nose tingle a bit (more of a pepper sensation than the actual smell). Patchouli is beautifully balanced - I don't pick up on an 'earthiness' but this is definitely taming the sweet from the vanilla. I normally dislike vanilla, so this was a dark horse. This reads to me as a very wearable, sophisticated Tootsie roll and I am here for it. (Smells spot on like the massage bar)


Karma: I smelled you in perfume form and I hated you üôÉ Please take this as my formal apology, because you are actually quite lovely. 
This gives candied orange peel and incense. If you want to smell like an actual hippie, this is not for you. If you want to smell like the good looking actors that play hippies, roller skate, and wear flowers in their hair - you are in for a treat. 


Supermilk - Stunning! I own Chelsea Morning, but this is a different take. CM is sweet glazed pastries on a morning walk to perk up, SM is a lemon tea enjoyed in the evening to calm down. No cinnamon dry down here- linear and stunning .


Strawberry feels Forever- I don't get fresh strawberries, but I think the 'plastic' smell some people get is better described as strawberry cotton candy. A bit synthetic, but in a strawberry syrup kind of way. I need to give her a full wear on skin. Only one I may end up returning


Pumpkin Spice- this is not a PSL. This is reminiscent of cinnamon candies, but has a slight cold and woody undertone. VERY SPICY - but also has a smell similar to a fog machine. My brain actually just placed this scent - if You've been on Pirates of The Caribbean in Disney, or Spaceship earth, this is the fire scent from both of those rides. Would not wear this on a coffee date, would absolutely wear this to plunder a ship or conquer Rome- in a cute fall sweater.

Bonus, not pictured: 29 high street perfume. Yep, you are lush in a bottle. Vaguely bubble gummy, but not too sweet. Clean but not soapy. I believe we will meet again soon. Very impressed at how spot on this one is.",26,1754504924.0,LushCosmetics,6,0.97,False

I have a lot of internship experience in marketing, advertising, and web content writing, but I don't have a specific niche I excell at. I'm on all the job sites, carefully reading each description, editing my resume and cover letters accordingly. For three months, it's been radio silence, with the occasional welcome rejection letter, since most companies no longer have the decency to even send one.   
  
I'm starting to hate it. Every time I have to open my computer with the intention to scan new postings, I almost break down. I don't even enjoy marketing or advertising, it's merely something I figured I could make a living out of and I'm starting to doubt that. I feel like I'll slowly get burnt out being tied to a desk typing away at a computer every day for a fake-smile, corporate company. So I took a step back and realized that the one job/internship I enjoyed was being a barista at a local coffee shop at my university. I've had a lifelong passion for cooking and coffee, and watching someone walk away satisfied with something I made made me genuinely happy. It's a distant dream of mine to open up a coffee shop one day, but I have no experience running a business. 

Here's where I need advice. Do I:  
\-Suck it up and I keep applying for full-time jobs with the prospect of making good money  
\-Get a job as a barista, doing something I enjoy, with the prospect of opening a coffee shop one day  
\-Get the barista job and keep looking for marketing/advertising jobs  
\-Do something completely different that I'm not considering?

My dilemma stems from the fact that I've never had a full-time job, so I can't truly say it's not for me yet. But, I did have a job as a barista which I genuinely enjoyed. There's also the fact that I don't want to ""waste"" my degree by pursuing something completely outside of it. I'm sorry if this is a silly thing to post here, but I really just need some reassurance or advice on what to do. ",0,1754504876.0,jobs,1,0.5,False

I had chronic watery diarrhea for 7-8 days. I couldn‚Äôt leave the house without taking Imodium. It may have also been food poisoning but for now, I‚Äôll just say it was a bug. This post will consist of a pre, and post, of that viral situation. Not looking for medical advice since I‚Äôm working with a great Gastro but I definitely would like to hear some opinions. 

Before I got the virus, I would get my probiotics exclusively from Activia yogurt. I would have a light breakfast in the morning with some black coffee, and I would have a bowel movement right after. This consisted of a lot of straining, it coming out a little at a time, wipes that were like wiping peanut butter out of a jar, and feeling of incompleteness. I would go to work feeling like not everything came out. 

When I got the bug, I went to see my gastro and we talked about probiotic pills. So I picked some up on Amazon. I‚Äôm not sure if I can mention brand names but it basically states it has 60 billion CFU, 10 strains, and organic prebiotics. I cut out the yogurts, and now I exclusively take these. 

After I‚Äôve recovered from the virus, I continued to take these pills and stopped with the yogurts. I also eat a banana from time to time which is something I never used to eat. But that‚Äôs the only difference! Nothing else has changed. I do everything else the same as I was before I got the virus. 

Now, I have the most amazing poops and haven‚Äôt experienced something like this in years. I get full complete bowel movements in one go, no straining or sitting on the toilet waiting for more to come out, and I also get the ghost wipes. 

I sometimes see that probiotic pills get a bit of hate on this sub reddit. I really would like to hear some opinions on this. Should I take these long term? Anyone else here take probiotic pills? 

Of course I‚Äôll be asking my gastro all of these questions the next time I see him. But I would definitely like to hear your input!",3,1754504830.0,Microbiome,3,1.0,False

Googled ‚Äútop casino Australia‚Äù with greasy fingers, saw Crown Casino pop up, even had a little live chat window with a bot calling me ‚Äúmate.‚Äù Real friendly vibe.



What blew my mind was the crypto deposit ‚Äì like, just a few clicks and my Bitcoin was in the casino account. Didn‚Äôt even have to show them my busted-up old debit card. Went straight for blackjack, because you always hear about it in movies and footy trips. I was tipsy off three Carlton Draughts (they were on special at the bottle-o), got a bit brave with my bets. At first, my hands were shaking so much I almost hit ‚Äústand‚Äù on 12. A couple proper dodgy calls later, sweated through some good hands, managed to claw back everything I‚Äôd lost on FluffCoin. Honestly, mighta whooped out loud.



But me being me, I didn‚Äôt know when to quit. Left a sensible amount in the account, tipped the live dealer because I felt bad for yelling ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go!‚Äù down the mic, then whacked the rest onto slots ‚Äì flashing lights, spinning reels, crazy noises, all of it. Even tried a quick go on something called ‚ÄúMegaways Bonanza,‚Äù though I had no clue what was happening. Had this epic moment where I thought I was about to hit the jackpot, but turns out it was just a demo round. Lost basically everything except enough change for an Uber home.

  
A bit off-track but somewhere that night I chatted to this retiree bloke from Queensland at the blackjack table, who swore he paid off half his mortgage from sports betting. Dunno if he was having a laugh, but we swapped stories about the best pie shops in Sydney and he gave me his footy tips for the week ‚Äì which, of course, bombed.



Despite burning through it all, the adrenaline rush was real. By the time I got home my head was spinning and I realized I wasn‚Äôt even upset about the loss ‚Äì just weirdly grateful I‚Äôd landed back on my feet (sorta). Decided then that quick wins are never worth the grind. Packed up my leftover Bitcoin and stopped following those ‚Äúcrypto bros‚Äù online. Now, all I ever punt is what I can afford to lose and I only throw cash into Bitcoin ‚Äì at least then, the rollercoaster‚Äôs a bit slower.

What blew my mind was the crypto deposit ‚Äì like, just a few clicks and my Bitcoin was in the casino account. Didn‚Äôt even have to show them my busted-up old debit card. Went straight for blackjack, because you always hear about it in movies and footy trips. I was tipsy off three Carlton Draughts (they were on special at the bottle-o), got a bit brave with my bets. At first, my hands were shaking so much I almost hit ‚Äústand‚Äù on 12. A couple proper dodgy calls later, sweated through some good hands, managed to claw back everything I‚Äôd lost on FluffCoin. Honestly, mighta whooped out loud.



But me being me, I didn‚Äôt know when to quit. Left a sensible amount in the account, tipped the live dealer because I felt bad for yelling ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go!‚Äù down the mic, then whacked the rest onto slots ‚Äì flashing lights, spinning reels, crazy noises, all of it. Even tried a quick go on something called ‚ÄúMegaways Bonanza,‚Äù though I had no clue what was happening. Had this epic moment where I thought I was about to hit the jackpot, but turns out it was just a demo round. Lost basically everything except enough change for an Uber home.

  
A bit off-track but somewhere that night I chatted to this retiree bloke from Queensland at the blackjack table, who swore he paid off half his mortgage from sports betting. Dunno if he was having a laugh, but we swapped stories about the best pie shops in Sydney and he gave me his footy tips for the week ‚Äì which, of course, bombed.



Despite burning through it all, the adrenaline rush was real. By the time I got home my head was spinning and I realized I wasn‚Äôt even upset about the loss ‚Äì just weirdly grateful I‚Äôd landed back on my feet (sorta). Decided then that quick wins are never worth the grind. Packed up my leftover Bitcoin and stopped following those ‚Äúcrypto bros‚Äù online. Now, all I ever punt is what I can afford to lose and I only throw cash into Bitcoin ‚Äì at least then, the rollercoaster‚Äôs a bit slower.



Bit after all that, good news actually found me for once. Boss finally noticed I was the only one not chucking sickies every Monday, pulled me aside and offered me the warehouse manager job. First time in ages I felt proud. Treated myself to a proper burger and fries and even shouted Jeff a coffee ‚Äì man still sings ‚ÄúEye of the Tiger‚Äù but I can hack it. These days, life‚Äôs still not flash and the house prices are still nuts, but I‚Äôm content, which I reckon is what really counts.

A few months ago, I had one of those ‚Äúwhere did all my money go?‚Äù moments.  
I opened my bank app. Then I opened my notes app. Then I opened 3 expense tracker apps‚Ä¶  
And then I closed them all.

Adding every transaction manually is a chore ‚Äî and it‚Äôs exactly why I (and probably a lot of people) just don‚Äôt do it consistently.

So I decided to build something that works the way I think:  
Just say what I spent ‚Äî and let the app figure it out.

I spent the last 6 months building¬†**WalletGPT**¬†‚Äî a voice-powered expense tracker where you can literally say:

""Spent 5$ on coffee today, 65.5$ on electricity bills last friday and refueled my car for 30$ yesterday""

‚Ä¶and it will:

* üß† Understand what‚Äôs income vs expense
* üóÇÔ∏è Break it into multiple transactions
* üóìÔ∏è Parse natural language dates
* üìä Categorize everything with AI

Last week I finally launched it on¬†[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6747127537)¬†only for now.

In the¬†**first 5 days**:

* ‚úÖ 61 downloads
* ‚úÖ 3 users started a trial

Not huge numbers, but seeing people¬†*use*¬†something I made is surreal.

I‚Äôm planning to add:

* Budget alerts
* Recurring transactions
* Multi-language support
* Better UI polish

I told her numerous times that she can take as much time as she needs to pay me, I'm not in a hurry but she wants to finish paying me asap.

The concept is basically a tool that lets you send small, local gifts (like a free coffee or ice cream cone) to your clients once a quarter via email....more like a ‚Äújust thinking of you‚Äù gesture than a marketing push. Focus would be on booked clients only not prospective.  Clients would go to the local shop to redeem the item.  I like the idea of only using local shops and reinvesting in the local economy here.

It‚Äôs not cash or gift cards, and the total annual value is under the $50 limit. There‚Äôs no tie to a quote, sale, or referral.  Just a soft-touch way to maintain relationships and show appreciation.

#‚Å£ Is There a Car Show Near‚Å£ Me Today? Your 2025 Guide

Finding a car show near you can transform an ordinary day into an unforgettable experience. Whether you're a seasoned automotive enthusiast, a casual ‚Äåadmirer of classic vehicles,‚Äã or simply looking for ‚Å£a ‚Äçfun family outing, the allure of gleaming chrome, powerful engines, and shared passion draws crowds to ‚Å£car shows of ‚Äçall shapes and sizes.‚Äç In 2025, the methods for discovering these events have become more refined, personalized, ‚Å£and readily accessible than ever‚Äã before. This comprehensive guide explores the best strategies for finding a car show near ‚Å¢you today, while also providing‚Äå the knowledge you‚Äôll‚Å¢ need ‚Å§to make the most of your experience.

**modern Online Resources: the Digital Showroom**

The internet remains the most‚Å£ powerful tool for‚Å£ locating car shows. However,‚Å¢ gone are the ‚Äçdays of ‚Å¢simple ‚Å£search engine queries. ‚Å£Modern websites and‚Å§ event platforms offer ‚Å§advanced filtering capabilities and dedicated ‚Å£features designed to connect‚Äã enthusiasts with local events.

Car show listing websites are specialized databases that aggregate‚Å§ data from various sources. Websites such as CruiseCal.com, classiccars.com, and Hemmings.com often maintain updated lists of ‚Å¢local and regional car shows, swap meets, and automotive events. ‚ÄåThese sites ‚Äçusually allow‚Å¢ you to filter by date, location, car type (classic, exotic, muscle, etc.), and event type (show,‚Å¢ cruise, auction).

Event ‚Å¢platforms like Eventbrite, Meetup, and Facebook Events are also valuable resources. Many local organizers list their car shows on ‚Äãthese platforms to reach a wider audience. Facebook Events,especially,benefits from the social network effect,allowing you to see which of your friends might‚Äã be interested or attending,fostering a sense of community ‚Äåeven before you ‚Äåarrive.

car‚Äç club websites and forums are often overlooked goldmines. Local‚Äç car clubs frequently host or participate‚Äã in‚Äå shows, and‚Å£ their websites ‚Äåand forums provide detailed information about upcoming events, including registration details,‚Äå schedules, and‚Å§ contact information.

**Harnessing the Power of Mobile Apps**

Smartphones have revolutionized‚Å§ how we discover and experience events.‚Äå Several mobile apps are designed specifically for car enthusiasts, ‚Äçmaking it easier‚Å¢ than ever to find shows on the go.

Apps such as ""Car‚Å§ Show Finder"" or regional automotive apps provide curated lists of local events, frequently enough with features like GPS integration, event notifications, and user ‚Å§reviews. These apps streamline ‚Å§the process of finding car shows by centralizing ‚Å§information from‚Äå various sources into a user-amiable interface.

The advantage of using a mobile ‚Å¢app ‚Äåis the‚Å§ ability to receive‚Äç real-time updates and notifications about car shows happening nearby. Many apps also allow you‚Å§ to set preferences based on your interests, ensuring that ‚Å§you only receive notifications about events ‚Äçthat are relevant to ‚Å¢you.

Utilizing‚Å£ the‚Å§ device's GPS to pinpoint your location, these ‚Å£apps often include directions, parking information, and even weather forecasts,‚Äç enhancing‚Äç the overall experience.

**Social Media: Tuning In to ‚Äåthe Car Community**

Leveraging‚Å¢ social media effectively can‚Å§ unlock a treasure trove ‚Äåof information‚Äã about local‚Å§ car shows. Platforms like Instagram, Facebook,‚Å§ and even‚Äå twitter can be instrumental in discovering events you might otherwise miss.

Hashtags are your friends. Searching‚Å¢ for‚Äç hashtags like #carshownearme, #classiccarshow, #musclecarshow, or #[yourcity]carshow on instagram and Twitter can reveal posts from organizers, attendees, and vendors showcasing upcoming events. Pay attention ‚Äåto the images and captions, as they frequently enough contain key details about‚Å§ the show's theme, location, ‚Å£and schedule.

Facebook groups dedicated‚Äã to car enthusiasts are another invaluable ‚Å§resource. joining local car clubs or automotive communities ‚Å§on‚Å¢ Facebook allows you ‚Äåto connect with fellow enthusiasts,‚Å§ receive event announcements, and participate in‚Äç discussions about upcoming‚Å§ shows.These groups frequently enough serve as ‚Å§a hub for sharing information and coordinating attendance at local events.

Furthermore, following‚Å£ local automotive businesses, such ‚Å£as repair shops, dealerships, and‚Äå detailing services,‚Å£ on social‚Äç media can provide insights into upcoming car shows. These businesses often sponsor or participate in local events and are‚Äç likely to‚Å£ promote them on their social media channels.

**The ‚Å£Importance of‚Äå Local Resources**

While digital tools offer convenience, don't underestimate the power of local‚Å§ resources. Connecting with the car ‚Å¢community in your‚Äã area can provide a more personal and informed viewpoint.

Local‚Äã car clubs are the heart of the car enthusiast community. Joining a car club is an excellent way to network with fellow enthusiasts, learn about local events, and even participate in organizing shows. car clubs often have established relationships with local businesses and venues, giving ‚Äçthem access to information‚Å¢ that might‚Å§ not be readily available online.

Attending local cruise nights‚Å£ and informal gatherings is another great way to discover upcoming car shows. These events often serve as a meeting point‚Äå for car enthusiasts and a place to exchange information about upcoming events. Cruise ‚Äãnights are a especially good way‚Å¢ to find smaller, more community-oriented car shows that might not be widely advertised.

Moreover, checking community‚Å¢ bulletin boards at local businesses, such as ‚Äãauto parts stores, gas stations, and coffee ‚Å£shops, can reveal ‚Å§flyers or posters advertising upcoming car shows in the area. These offline resources can ‚Äåoften provide information about smaller, more grassroots events that might not have a strong online presence.

**2025 Trends Shaping the Car Show Experience**

The car show ‚Å¢landscape‚Äå is constantly evolving, influenced by ‚Å£changing demographics, technological advancements, and evolving preferences. In‚Äç 2025,‚Å£ several trends are shaping the car show experience.

Electric vehicle (EV) participation is on the ‚Å¢rise. as EVs become more mainstream, car shows ‚Å£are increasingly featuring electric vehicles‚Äå alongside ‚Äåclassic and modern‚Äå internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. EV enthusiasts ‚Å§are creating their own communities and‚Å£ events, showcasing the latest electric models, customized EVs, and innovative charging solutions.

Virtual and hybrid car shows are gaining traction.The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of virtual and hybrid car shows, and this trend is expected to continue in 2025. Virtual car shows offer a way ‚Å§to connect with enthusiasts from around the world, while hybrid shows ‚Äåcombine in-person and online elements, providing a more flexible and accessible experience.

Interactive ‚Äåexperiences are becoming more ‚Äåcommon. Car shows are increasingly incorporating‚Äç interactive elements,‚Å§ such as driving simulators, virtual reality experiences, and hands-on workshops, ‚Äãto ‚Å¢engage attendees and provide a more immersive experience. These interactive elements appeal to a wider audience, including families and younger ‚Äçgenerations, making car shows more than just passive displays of vehicles.

**Maximizing Your Car Show Experience**

Once ‚Äåyou've found a car‚Äã show‚Äå near ‚Äãyou, preparing for the event can considerably enhance your experience.

Plan your visit in advance. ‚Å¢Check the ‚Äãevent schedule to identify the activities and attractions that ‚Äãinterest ‚Å£you most. Arrive early to avoid crowds and secure‚Å£ a‚Äå good parking spot. If you're planning to photograph the cars, consider the lighting conditions and bring appropriate equipment.

Dress comfortably and be prepared for the weather. Car shows often involve spending several hours outdoors,so‚Å£ dress‚Äå accordingly. Check the weather ‚Å¢forecast and bring sunscreen,a hat,and water to stay comfortable.

Engage with the owners and other enthusiasts. Car‚Å§ shows are‚Å§ a great ‚Å£chance to learn about‚Å£ different ‚Å£makes and models,hear stories about restoration projects,and connect with fellow enthusiasts. Don't be afraid to ask questions and share your own passion for‚Äå cars.Respect the vehicles. Remember that the ‚Äçcars on ‚Å¢display are ‚Äãoften valuable and cherished possessions. Avoid touching or‚Äã leaning on the vehicles without the owner's permission.**Safety and‚Å£ Considerations**

Attending car shows requires an awareness of potential safety ‚Äçissues.

Hydration is crucial, especially in warm weather. Bring water ‚Äãand drink regularly to avoid dehydration.

Sun‚Äå protection‚Äç is essential. Wear sunscreen, a‚Äç hat, and sunglasses to protect ‚Äåyourself from the sun's harmful rays.

Be aware of your surroundings. Car shows can be crowded, so ‚Äãbe‚Å£ mindful of your surroundings and watch out for potential hazards, such as uneven surfaces or moving‚Å£ vehicles.

Adhere to event rules and regulations. Follow the instructions‚Å¢ of event staff and ‚Äçrespect any rules or regulations‚Å£ that are‚Äå in place.

**Beyond the Show: Building a Car-Centric Life**

Finding a ‚Å£local car ‚Å§show is ‚Äçjust the ‚Å§beginning of a perhaps lifelong ‚Äãjourney into the world of automotive‚Äã enthusiasm.Participating in‚Äã the ‚Å£car community‚Äç enriches lives, fostering friendships and ‚Äãproviding opportunities for learning and skill growth.

Attending car shows,cruise nights,and club meetings provides a ‚Äåsocial outlet and a chance to connect with like-minded individuals. Many enthusiasts form lasting friendships based on ‚Å§their shared passion for cars.

Working on cars, ‚Å§whether it's restoring a classic‚Å§ or simply‚Å§ performing‚Äå routine maintenance, can be a rewarding and empowering experience. Learning about mechanics and automotive systems allows you‚Äå to take control of your vehicle's upkeep and potentially save money on repairs.

supporting local automotive businesses helps to sustain the car community and ensure that resources are available for enthusiasts. Patronizing local repair shops, auto parts stores, and detailing services contributes to the overall‚Äç health and vitality of the automotive ecosystem.

finding a‚Å¢ car show ‚Å¢near you in 2025 is easier than ever, thanks‚Äã to the abundance of online‚Å§ resources, mobile apps, and local connections‚Å£ available ‚Äçto enthusiasts.‚Å£ By utilizing these tools‚Å§ effectively and preparing for the event, you‚Äå can maximize your car show experience and‚Äã immerse yourself in the vibrant ‚Äåworld of automotive culture. Whether you're a seasoned collector, a‚Å¢ casual admirer, or simply‚Å£ looking‚Å§ for a fun day out, a car show offers a unique opportunity to appreciate the beauty, ingenuity,‚Äã and passion that define the automotive world.

1mjcbq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipanarchy/comments/1mjcbq7/livein_partner_chronic_depression_vicious_cycle/,"live-in partner chronic depression, vicious cycle with loss of sex","hello all! i'm posting to clarify my own thoughts by describing my situation. i wouldn't mind anyone chiming in with advice or wisdom, either. 

so the two of us have known each other for almost 2 years now (me 29m, her 28f). notably, it was the first partnership i have had where both of us are totally nonjealous and make no claims to control or restrict the other's actions. ironically, after that starting point, we have both been almost de-facto monogamous by virtue of her being very introverted and critical and never finding anyone worthy of her interest, and me being kinda autistic and demiromantic and spending lots of my time doing chores to hold the house together and pursuing my solo projects during free time. 

6 months into knowing each other, i moved out of my previous rental and started staying with her in her 1br apartment. right at the start we had 3mo in a row of two separate people staying in the living room, and i was unemployed and the most technical person of us all, so i typically ended up doing the cooking, the dishes, although we shared the house cleaning decently evenly. besides those i would also provide behind the scenes emotional support to her, bc the two guests each caused her various levels of psychological discomfort, although she continued to host them out of duty and idealism. in those days our relationship was fresh and we had fun many days, with her insecurities mostly coming out in the form of taking criticism or logistical planning personally, or casting interpersonal events in a negative light (making self into a victim). I was usually able to talk her out of those spirals, and we also both loved to philosophize and share our observations of people and social dynamics, and share our new discoveries with each other.

after 6mo of living with her, i had planned to go off and travel in my truck for a while before finding a place to move to. however much fun we had biking around in our old town in the summer weekends, we had realized that we both hated the rich privileged suburbanites and needed to leave. we made plans for me to hold off on traveling and wait for her to quit her job and leave with me. anticipating the departure, she started to fall into days-long existential depressions, saying she doesn't think she can handle living on the road, saying she is afraid the pets (her dog and cat) will die, saying she can't feel love from me, saying she isn't getting meaningful emotional support from me and all of her friends are inadequate. (as we neared our departure she started to see more and more flaws in her previous friends, and gradually reduced contact with most of them bc of philosophical differences--all while not knowing anyone but me she thinks has an acceptable philosophy). I started worrying a little when she would question my love/support, bc i was trying everything i could to help her thru the depressions and i was still doing most of the home chores, i was getting tired out, and then drinking or smoking in the evening to try to relax for a bit. oftentimes, even tho she would say she doesn't want to influence my behavior, it would seem like me using intoxicants or playing video games or doing computer research for a few hours in the evening would often catalyze one of her depressions, especially if she made a bid for my attention and i asked for some alone time. 

now, we moved out into the truck and the chore load got heavier--hauling water, cooking from scratch on fire, keeping appraised of the animals, etc. she helped where she could, but with most things she lacked confidence and having a technical issue or two would make her start questioning her overall aptitude--ironic imo bc she is not a technical person at all, so evaluating herself on technical ability is a recipe for dissatisfaction. 

we had talked about how she needed a break from work and how she could chill and decompress while we were camping, and i didn't think anything could go wrong with it, but boy! once we were living in the truck full time, doing a lot of labor to keep ourselves alive and live outside in the world, she started getting depressed bc ""she wasn't accomplishing anything,"" or ""there is no place in this world she belongs."" so then more chores fell to me and i also had to keep trying to help her balance out her emotions. in the evening if she was depressed she would not want to help cook, she would've gone without eating, but i wouldn't let her, i would make it, but then around my bedtime she would say ""so you're just gonna fall asleep like always and leave me like this."" because she wouldn't be able to sleep for hours--but the thing is, during this period my efforts started to apparently fall significantly flat. i could stay up and talk with her for an hour, but at the end she would say i hasn't helped her at all, or say i was refusing to talk to her. so it would confuse and tire me further, and it felt like she wanted to make me not rest if she couldn't. during the good periods we would still have fun together and we were having some sex, but she could be good for only one day and then have 3 in a row of depression. 

So with all this caregiving i didn't really get to do the plans i had made for the summer, we mostly just barely scraped by for 4 months, and i had planned to stay out there for 6 months but i realized she's not gonna handle it and we needed to start looking for an apartment. when we got an apartment she hugged me in mania and said ""you were right that i needed a place and stability!"" and we had a few fun weeks of exploring the city and getting our apartment ready. now the fun times are diminishing as work looms over her head (i'm fine with working and not worrying). the only thing is, with the work we've been doing to prepare the apartment and now to take care of it, and to get the fleas off the animals, we have been keeping pretty busy and we still haven't made any local friends. she has started saying what she says whenever we go a few days without sex (""do you even want me?"" ""there is nothing for me to live for if i can't have pleasure."" ""we are never going to have sex again""). it has been a week, probably. this morning, after we talked about how to better make sex happen two days ago, she woke up in depression and said ""you won't have sex with me"", when i was laying in bed next to her and drinking coffee. apparently she had expected while in the dawn twilight state that when she rubbed her ass on me i would jump on that with no words needed, and without a single word spoken she had determined that i had rejected her, become depressed, and started slinging allegations. the thing is, i can push past a few false allegations, but once she turns my mood sour to her, i don't have enough patience to calmly soothe her, and i have to take an hour or two and check back in. with all this time spent just trying to attain emotional regulation, it's no wonder we're not having sex. i mean, people in warzones are not having much sex i think. i'm trying to do right by her, and i'm trying not to let the relationship explode as we just signed a year lease together, and on top of all that i'm trying to eventually find the time to initiate sex and make her feel that it's genuine--but if she senses that i'm doing it bc she asked and not bc i wanted it, she'll freak out. the thing is it's kinda hard to be attracted to a person you're doing lots of caregiving for. i also have ""problems"" with diminishing sexual interest after the first few months of a partner. i pretty much feel like we should just be focusing on getting her to be able to live day by day--i don't even mean stability but simply coping--but the hard thing is if any component is missing she will be devastated. 

i don't even know if any situation could be something she would be happy with. and i don't really mind...? but she seems to mind, it seems like being depressed is psychologically agonizing for her. i think many many people have lifetime depression, and i don't even mind doing the chores or compromising on my hobbies, but i'm wondering overall if the patterns we have built are gradually improving or perhaps incentivizing bad behavior. i don't even know if either of us is responding to incentives or just behaving whatever way we are predisposed to. sometimes we imagine that if she made a feeling friend that would be another good person for her to talk to. 

not to be too one sided, i admit i'm mentioning mainly the hard times, and we still have fun some days. and i know that some people say self-regulation is a prerequisite for having an adult relationship, but i also think many people genuinely cannot self regulate and i don't know that they should be excluded from relating.
anyway, gotta go bc she's having s breakdown in the kitchen, thanks for reading :)",1,1754504387.0,relationshipanarchy,4,1.0,False

He told me he'll reach in 30 mins or so...Toh I went to buy Rakhi and chocolates for him. After this, I lit my cigarette and started walking towards Parkside, thought I'd wait for him there for a few minutes. It was so hot and humid, and I was drenched in sweat. As I was about to enter the park, a man who was walking by my side said, "" Aap park jaare ho?"" (Are you going to park?) I said, Yes. And, then started walking at a fast pace cuz I knew this man was gonna ask questions and initiate convo bla bla, basically A CREEP.   
But, thankfully, he went in another direction, and as I was about to take a sigh of relief, he turned back and started asking me questions like :   
Aap Vajiram mei ho...? Aapko kahi dekha...to which I replied a plain no.   
  
Then he  started walking by my side and again started asking questions :   
Kaha sei coaching kiya, kha rhete ho, your name and whatnot.

It was very clearly visible on my face that I'm not interested in this conversation and feeling very uncomfortable, but he still went on. By the time I threw my cigarette, he literally started asking What does it taste like!?  
Like wtf brooooo....who asks these types of questionsss....that was not enough for him. Now this man literally kept asking me for my contact. At first, I said I only use Insta and don't use any other app.   
But then he clearly asked for my contact and said Let's meet for coffee.   
My brain was not processing a shit. I was so confused, and idk what happened. I wasn't even able to say a clear NO to his face. Like, I know I should have shouted and made myself clear. But, idk I wasn't able to.   


I ended up giving him my telegram and left that place cuz my friend was about to arrive. 

I took a sigh of relief as I reached the metro gate. 

BUT, BUT.... torturous day... another guy came and started saying he's from some xyz ngo, I never heard about and asked me to scan a QR code and provide my details. This time, I said No, I'm not fit for this. 

Now, I don't even know whether this guy was genuine or not. I just heard him laughing as he went back to his friend. 

Finally my friend came and walked out of that place. 

Like literally the first question I asked him was - meri shkal pr kahi AVAILABLE likha hua h kya!!?

I honestly don't expect creeps at places like ORN or student areas, but this place is full of them. And, honestly, this is not the first time. It has happened many times. At this point, I'm so fed up with these creeps lurking here and there.  

I just wanted to vent about this...Thanks if you read it. and, pls suggest me what to do when these types of creeps approach out of nowhere. ",17,1754504334.0,UPSC,24,0.91,False

1mjc8su,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mjc8su,"Bought milled lumber, is this acceptable?","Hello,

I am a very novice woodworker. I completed a few small projects of plywood, MDF, and pine. I am currently following the beginner woodworking online course from Foureyes, Shawn Boyd and Lincoln st and I am at the point of starting on the coffee table, which I want to make out of hardwood. Before I want to do that I want to know what it is like to work with hardwood. So I ordered pre-milled (4 faces) lumber from a reputable source here in the Netherlands for the very first time. I do not own a jointer or a planer. The lumber, being one board of walnut and one board of hard maple arrived today. The walnut looks fine to me but I am hesitant towards the hard maple.

It has some dents/pits and scratches which I believe are not a natural quality of the board or are milling marks. Also the board has a bow of 8mm in the middle and a slight twist. The boards where packed in a way which did not meet my expectation for ‚Ç¨100+ worth of lumber and almost ‚Ç¨10 shipping cost. I like to hear what all of you think about this board before I contact the supplier.

1mjc8lj,https://i.redd.it/c0yxb0zoxfhf1.jpeg,"Review: Umana Bali, LXR Hotels & Resorts","I‚Äôve been meaning to get around to this for a minute, but haven‚Äôt gotten the chance. Here‚Äôs the scoop:

*Pre-Arrival:* Received an email forwarded to me from my TA with a Curator form asking for robe sizes, preferred beverages at restaurants, airport transportation, etc for each guest. Also asked for Villa preferences, i.e. close to facilities or more remote. Received a very kind response from my curator after I submitted, and every request was honored. More on that below.

*Check-In*: My TA booked a Hilton For Luxury rate, which includes 4th night free, complimentary breakfast for everyone in the villa, and a USD 150 resort credit. I am a Hilton Honors Diamond member, and this further entitled me to 25% off F&B  (interesting benefit) and +30min on any massage booking (yet again, a first). At check-in, they provided a welcome beverage, cold towel, and a Balinese welcome ritual with a traditional bracelet, which I thought was a fun touch. They also recognized me by name right as I arrived, even though I didn‚Äôt book transportation directly through the hotel (Blacklane is excellent in Bali, used it everywhere).

*The Room*: Stellar 2bd Villa with huge pool, the first bedroom is attached to the living room and the 2nd is across a little water bridge with two twins where my kids stayed. Massive, well-appointed bathrooms. The entire villa is enclosed by a fence, plenty of trees, and felt very secluded. The pool area also had a jacuzzi and gazebo to hang around at. Daily housekeeping was incredibly thorough, and the one time they came to make up the room while we were in it, the staff made us a cup of coffee and hand-delivered it to our villa while we waited. I was so surprised. üòÇ Otherwise, all housekeeping appeared to be coordinated around dining reservations, which was nice.

*Dining*: We ate at each of the resort‚Äôs two main restaurants, Oliverra and Commune, which were stellar for dinner and very reasonably priced. Great views as well. Commune, although more casual, had better food we thought. The menus were a bit more interesting and local. Plenty of vegetarian options for those meeting that criteria. Breakfast is at commune, which has a beautiful buffet and an additional a la carte menu, all of which was above and beyond. The breakfast staff always greeted each of us by name and the chefs personally came out to ask how the food was. The pastry chef, Leah, is incredible (try the almond croissant, you won‚Äôt regret it).

*Beach*: The resort has the Uma Beach Club on Melasti beach, with great food. You do have to take a shuttle to reach it, though. The beach is swimmable, but wavy, although beautiful with clear water.

*Service*: Everyone greeted by name, and no request was too big or too small. The staff was so kind, can‚Äôt say enough great things about them. Absolutely stellar.

*Accessibility*: My son is a part time wheelchair user, many efforts were made to accommodate and golf carts were available in minutes to take him anywhere. Major areas have ramps and our villa was level entry. All showers were roll-in. Some barriers did exist though in the villa, such as the gazebo being a bit raised. Probably not suited for full-time users.

We paid ~$1,200 USD per night, and I felt that was incredible for the experience we had.

Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a Bali resort!

Mislim da ƒáe ovo biti podulji post jer se danas osjeƒáam vrlo inspirativno hehe nemojte zamjerit.

Dakle, dama od 24 godine iz Zagreba u potrazi za princom na bijelom konju.

Mislim da nitko ne voli ovaj dio kad mora opisat sebe, ali probat ƒáu biti ≈°to objektivnija.
Visoka sam 173 cm, imam smeƒëu kosu do ramena i prekomjerne sam tjelesne te≈æine (svjesna da takav izgled veƒáini ne odgovara). Karakterno sam mirna, empatiƒçna, znati≈æeljna i dosta osjetljiva, ≈°to mi nekada zna biti i mana. Nisam svadljiva niti burno reagiram, sve probleme poku≈°avam rije≈°iti mirnim putem.
Nedavno sam zavr≈°ila fakultet, a veƒá godinama radim s djecom s te≈°koƒáama te trenutno tra≈æim posao u prosvjeti. ≈Ωivim sama u svom stanu i imam svoj auto, al o njemu ne znam gotovo ni≈°ta i uvijek me strah da ƒáe me majstor zajebat tijekom popravka. Kad ƒáe morat popravljat gefufnu ili neki vrag.
Malo sam zapustila svoje hobije tijekom studija jer sam uz faks, projekte i poslove bila dosta zauzeta, tako da im se sada poku≈°avam vratiti, a radi se o ƒçitanju i sviranju klavira. Zadnje ≈°to sam ƒçitala: Zamjatin - Mi, Kawaguchi - before the coffee gets cold, Sol≈æenjicin - Jedan dan u ≈æivotu Ivana Denisoviƒáa. 
Volim i kuhati, ali mi se ƒçesto neda radit neka konkretnija jela samo za sebe tako da budi spreman na degustacije svega i svaƒçega. 
Voljela bih se baviti i nekom fiziƒçkom aktivno≈°ƒáu, a s obzirom da radim na gubitku vi≈°ka kilograma razmi≈°ljam da upi≈°em boks ili neki borilaƒçki sport, ali dobro bi mi do≈°ao i partner za ≈°etnje, vo≈ænje biciklom ili planinarenje  (:

Filmove i serije ne pratim previ≈°e, ali mogu ih pogledat pogotovo u dobrom dru≈°tvu, a od glazbe ≈°tujem sve i sva≈°ta, od Jane i Seke preko Brkova, Silenti i Magazina do Nine Simone i Chopena. Ne diskriminiram. 
Nisam religiozna, nemam ni≈°ta protiv prakticiranja religije dok nisu ekstremi popit kleƒçanja na trgovima ili uskraƒáivanje prava nekom drugom, nisam domoljub, a kad je politika u pitanju rekla bih da sam apolitiƒçna, ali vrijednosti su mi ipak blago lijevo/liberalno usmjerene.

A sada, ≈°to tra≈æim? 
Tra≈æim mu≈°ku osobu u rasponu od 23 do 30 godina (ali ako ba≈° misli≈° da bi kliknuli,  tu mogu biti malo fleksibilna) iz Zagreba ili okolice. 
Jako mi je bitno da nisi pu≈°aƒç, a nisam fan ni alkohola ni droga i billo bi super da redovito brine≈° o svojoj higijeni. 
Dugoroƒçno tra≈æim mu≈æa jer ≈æelim brak i obitelj, tako da me kroniƒçna dopisivanja i veze na daljinu ne interesiraju. Jako mi je bitno da se ostvarim kao majka pa mi je naravno bitno i da ti ≈æeli≈° biti (aktivan i ukljuƒçen) otac.
Nije mi bitno niti ≈°ta radi≈° niti koliko zaraƒëuje≈° ni i≈°ta. Samo da si zaposlen (ili na studiju) i da zna≈° brinut o sebi.
Ne ≈æelim da si netko tko svoju stvarnost konstruira preko dru≈°tvenih mre≈æa, ≈°to je ironiƒçno jer ja 'ljubav svog ≈æivota' tra≈æim na istoj  (:
