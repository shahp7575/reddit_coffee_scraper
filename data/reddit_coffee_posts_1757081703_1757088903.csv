1n99dwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1n99dwm/why_is_always_babies_need_newstrange_people_time/,"Why is always ""babies need new/strange  people/ time away from Mom!"" And never the more natural and necessary ""babies need decompression time with Mom/time grounding in safety with parents""?!!!","My husband and I are on a family vacation with our baby (12M) for the first time and we have been very cool about letting my brother and SIL, and/or my parents watch her for long periods while we grab meals or coffee or hit the shops. (My husband is WFH and I am SAHM, so far she has never been to daycare) 

She seemed to be having a blast with them so we got so liberal with it that we went missing for entire wake windows a few times and let people give her meals or put her down for naps or bath/bed.

After a day where we were in and out, but others gave her her meals and were the ones to greet her after naps, we had a horrendous night with her.

She woke up five times in a row. We solved for gas, teeth, etc. But of course we know her well at this point and we know teething cries/behavior and indigestion cries/behavior and even though we gave meds just in case, we could tell these weren't her issues. 

She was doing something new. Waking up crying but when I sat down with her to nurse, boobs fully exposed, she'd just throw her arms around me and put her cheek against my chest and fall immediately silent and asleep. I've never known this kid to turn down nursing even if she were writhing with gas pains or screaming from gum pain. 

She'd seem dead to the world if we were holding her and then scream when put down. I realize that's somewhat normal for a baby but we have her fully gentle-sleep trained at this point and able to be put down awake for sleep. Usually she just rolls over and goes out. We finally solved it by letting her sleep on me for 15 or so and putting the tank top I sweated in all day next to her in the pack n play. Then she slept until morning. 

She's also been doing all her naps in the pack n play for a month or so and sleeps great in it. When we first arrived on vaca she slept beautifully through the night for the first few nights. It was only after accumulating days where we weren't her primary caregivers and then a day where we were missing from wake up to wake up and not there for the important parts of the routines that she had a night like this. My mom, who babysits her when we head out for a concert or dinner or something here and there, said she seemed worried and sort of deadpan when she got her up from the second nap that day. 

All this to say we felt pretty confident that we had just stretched her too far with adjusting to our absence and had sort of gotten out of balance with her need for exciting new loved ones vs her need for us (and us as touchstones of familiarity in a new place). We decided to rein it in and spend some more quality time with her for a couple days. 

That following morning we had plans to attend yoga on the beach and follow it up with brunch on the town. We arranged for my brother and SIL wake up very early to watch her. We ended up texting them right before their alarms to tell them that we were going to skip yoga on the beach after all and they could sleep in. 

That way we could spend some more time with her before brunch and not be gone the entire wake window. And also we were exhausted and wanting to sleep in ourselves. Shortly after getting up with her my dad appeared, being an early riser, and offered to spend time with her while we went back to sleep. We meant to only nap an hour but slept through both of our alarms and woke up at the end of the wake window. :( 

We felt guilty and rushed downstairs to give her breakfast and hang with her before her nap. 

This is where it got annoying for us. 

For the record and maybe for some foreshadowing, my brother and SIL are in their early forties, childless, and trying very hard for years to become pregnant. My SIL has nephews and a niece she cares for here and there. My brother likes to tell others about what a baby expert she is, what a natural mother, a ""queen with children"", who knows ""A LOT about babies""... etc etc.

One time when my GERD-diagnosed newborn was refusing to be calmed by me, her mother, my brother suggested I let his wife try. When I declined he said ""Are you sure? She's really good with babies."" When I let her hold my daughter later that night she danced with her and sang to her in a warbly loud tone like the ghost of Julie Andrews bearing the chains of Jacob Marley and made her cry. I know she was looking forward to babysitting that morning and that she was probably disappointed to lose a chance at one-on-one time with my baby. 

Brother and SIL emerged towards the end of her wake window and sat with us in the kitchen while we gave her her breakfast. They asked about the night and we told them everything I just detailed here. We mentioned how we didn't think it was teething pain, but we medicated her anyway. We told them how we decided it was separation anxiety and how we planned to just work in some more time with her during the days to get her feeling good again. 

When we finished relating all this, they said ""Huh. I wonder what it was."" 

We said ""It was that- separation anxiety"" 

My SIL said ""maybe it was teeth!!""

We said, no it wasn't, and she was well into a full Motrin dose for one of the wake ups. 

I reiterated why our working theory was what it was.

""....Huh.. I GUESS that could be"". 
He said childlessly. 

At that moment, my daughter swallowed the last little scrambled egg kernel she could stuff into her belly and started to cry, being at that point very due for her nap and we think also moving on from solving her hungry problem to wanting to solve her hang-with-mom-and-dad problem. She was crying and reaching for me. That's not how breakfast ends. Breakfast ends with smiling and clapping and babbling and being lifted and cleaned up and set down to happily play. 

As I wet a paper towel to wipe her face my brother watched her cry as I said to her ""Im coming baby one sec I know you want me to hold you.""

My brother said ""no I think she just feels messy!"" (There was yogurt on her face) 

Finally I said ""The thing is, our diagnostics come from spending all day every day with her for over a year. She's not crying because she feels messy- she has yogurt on her face like this every morning and she's usually smiling about it. She just wants us right now"". I finished cleaning her up and lifted her out of her chair onto my hip and she immediately stopped crying and smiled. I motioned towards the result with my open hand and they sat there like they didn't understand the gesture's implications. 


Since then there have been so many  comments about how we should take her out with us all to crowded fine dining (she has hit the screaming phase full force) (we have taken her out to casual deck-dining with all of us) or try her on a 2.5 hour boat tour because ""she loves new faces! She loves people! She needs to be around people!"" Or to not feel bad about the day we pretended to be childless a little too much because ""it's good for her!!""

Finally I said, yes she loves people watching and crowds and new faces, and it's good for her to spend time with others and see that we can go missing but come back etc, but not out of balance and not too much too fast.

I indulged myself after days of hearing the same judgey advice and went on to say ""A lot of people love to say oh they need strangers they need new faces because that includes themselves. That includes them. That makes them what the baby needs the most.""

And everyone seemed really offended that I said that and left the room. We leave for home tomorrow. I almost made it through the whole vacation without saying what I wanted to say. And I don't feel very sorry about it. 

We spent an hour or so with her yesterday after her second nap cuddling her and tickling her and singing to her and throwing her around in the bed and laughing before giving her to my parents and heading out to dinner. They did dinner bath and bedtime and she still slept through the night. The second we started investing a little more ""us time"" into the day, she went right back to being silly and engaging with everyone else, being easy to hand off to others, and sleeping through the night. 

So I guess it wasn't teeth or ""feeling messy"" after all. 

Sure babies need non-parental people in their life. 

But babies need their caretaker(s).

I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.



My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.



✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.



I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”



The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.



By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.



Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.



Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.



Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.



Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.



Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.



Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:



✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.



✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.



✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!



✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.



✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.



Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:



Bloating or gas



Irregular bowel movements



Leaky gut or food intolerances



Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings



Skin issues like acne or rashes



Weakened immunity



Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...



Then this product is 100% for you.



Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.



Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.



Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.



I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued — but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.



After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I’m honestly impressed.

This isn’t just another energy pill — it’s something different, and in this review, I’ll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it’s worth considering.



What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body’s ability to create real energy at the cellular level.



That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves — from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.



What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what’s inside:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).



N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.



Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn’t throwing random ingredients together — it’s built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn’t feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn’t been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I’m no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger — more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements



Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)



Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:



Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness



Want better exercise performance and recovery



Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally



Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements



However, if you’re just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn’t for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.



Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely — especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.



I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I’m fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.



Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.



Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.



✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



If you’re serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time — think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).



N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.



Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn’t throwing random ingredients together — it’s built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn’t feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn’t been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I’m no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger — more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements



Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)



Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:



Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness



Want better exercise performance and recovery



Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally

Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements

However, if you’re just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn’t for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.

Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely — especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.

I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I’m fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.

Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.

Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

If you’re serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time — think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.

1n99b8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/WalgreensStores/comments/1n99b8d/terminated/,Terminated,"It’s finally over. Woke up this morning, opened the store, safe count, coffee, and a dream. I put the drawers in, let my cashier in, finished setting Halloween— and fixed up some counts. 

Got a phone call from my SM… hm… Rare, strange, unexpected on a Friday.
“Hola bud.”
“Hey, go ahead and clock out when (Insert brohomertons name here, other SFL) arrives, I’ve been instructed to terminate you.”
“Oh…”
“Thank you sir.”
“They finished the investigation?”
“Yes, they said you did it every night, not a good look.”

This thing I did every night was actually so cracked and juicy— I broke the system so perfectly that I was leaving less than 2 minutes after doors locked, but I guess I wasn’t aware that it was terribly unprofessional. 
The other closers would always take the final drawer at around 9:30, making us card only, count it down and then save all the numbers. At 10:01 they’d band their final band, count the deposit and safe and call it a day. Some facing here some cleaning there and everyone’s out and happy by 10:20.

I’m not out or happy, I’m speed and power. I’d take the cash, count it down, and input everything right away. What’s the difference between putting all the numbers down at 9:30 instead? Nothing but a termination for “closing early” apparently. Safe count at 9:35 after the final band. Start facing at 9:40, vacuum and clean up, close the doors at 10. Only thing I had to do at 10 every night was hit that sweet “End of Day” and walk out. Best closings, fastest closings, but I guess in the end I flew far too close to the sun by doing everything early. Falling from the heights of perfect closings and cherishing every second I got to soar for the last year of 10:01 closings, the cameras eventually caught me doing a safe count 25 minutes before closing. (To be fair what got me terminated was the cameras seeing that over the last year at least 20 customers had been turned away for having cash during my card only time lol whoops).

1n99alo,https://www.reddit.com/r/PornAddiction/comments/1n99alo/my_husband_said_hed_quit_watching_porn_2_years/,My Husband Said He’d Quit Watching Porn 2 Years Ago and Still Views It More Often Than Not,"I would like to start off by saying that I love my husband very much and will not be taking anyone’s advice to divorce him (as everyone seems to jump to on here). This is simply a bump in the road and I know we can get through it together. I just want to hear from other couples on their experiences with anything similar and to see if anyone can help point us in the right direction (whether coming from other wives of husbands with porn addictions or from porn addicts themselves, I would love to hear any insight). 

So this all started before we got married a couple years ago and our sex life was in a downward spiral. He seemed to put porn and masturbation as a priority over having sex with me. He was doing it so often that he didn’t have enough left in the tank, so to speak, to intimate spend time with me. I noticed he wanted me to dress up more and I felt like he was starting to be less attracted to me and more attracted to his own alone time and the stuff on his screen. I asked him at that time if he’d be willing to at least cut it back and he agreed. He seemed to have a tough time doing that. So we had a long conversation and we both agreed we were going to both stop watching porn and masturbating on our own and agreed to save our intimacy for each other. I also grew up with an alcoholic father so I was hesitant to get into a marriage if he had a clear addiction as well and wasn’t willing to work on it and stop. 

So we got married because he was very reassuring that I was his priority and that he would stop it because it was effecting us. Fast forward to 2 years in and he’s been struggling with it a lot. I knew it wouldn’t be easy and was aware that relapses would likely happen and I was willing to do whatever I could to try and support him through this. I ask him about it here and there and he always tells me that he still views it pretty often. He mostly does this when he’s bored and home alone. He also mentioned that he doesn’t masturbate to it but does watch it. I always make sure I listen and ask questions in a way that doesn’t shame him. I appreciate that he tells me these things. We had another chat last night and he said that he had a snap to reality moment last weekend and has stopped viewing it this past week but before that he was viewing it often for the couple months before. A few months ago, he asked me to put the parental lock on his phone but he told me recently that he found a way around it. He also found his old phone that had porn he saved on it and viewed it there and he’s played porn games. Long story short, he’s like an alcoholic that went from having a few beers every night to now hiding it in his coffee and sneaking a few drinks in the garage. He confesses to me when I ask about it but he hides it from me and has been finding ways around everything. I asked him last night too if he still wants to quit and he said he does and that it hasn’t been that long. I pointed out that it’s been 2 years since he told me he would quit and it looked like from what he tells me that he still views it more often than not. He didn’t realize it had been that long already and he did agree that he relapsed for longer periods than he had time off of it. He’s adamant about not seeing a therapist or getting outside help. 

Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation and how do I best navigate this? Is there anything I can do as his wife to help him? I know I can’t do the work for him, but are there any resources or techniques that you guys have found that helped you? Unfortunately I don’t think he’d be willing to talk to anyone since he has a hard enough time talking to me about it. I just want to see him get to a place where this doesn’t control him anymore and he can beat this. Thanks so much and I appreciate any suggestions or personal experiences you guys give.

1n99aif,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1n99aif/officially_diagnosed_with_pots/,Officially diagnosed with POTS,"I was finally diagnosed with POTS on 9/2. A few weeks earlier, I went out with a friend and had coffee but I felt terrible when I got home. My heart rate shot up to 160, I felt short of breath, and my hands and shoulders were tingling. I went to the ER, but it turned out to be GERD. Ever since then, I never felt quite the same unless I drank electrolytes.

I consulted our family cardiologist who said it could be sinus tachycardia and scheduled a 24-hour Holter monitor to be sure. At my follow-up, I told her my heart rate kept spiking whenever I stood up. She reviewed my results and saw that my tachycardia was almost constant throughout the day. I mentioned reading about dysautonomia and POTS, she agreed that it was spot on and started me on ivabradine.

Now everything makes sense. (1) I often feel overheated and struggle to expel heat when the temperature is high. (2) I hate Physical Education class and working out to the core. (3) when doing household chores, I always needed breaks and my family would complain that my resting periods were longer than the time I spent working around the house. (4) I would always sit in an Asian squat whenever and wherever, even in crowded places. (5) when sitting or lying down, I automatically elevate my legs, (6) and when queuing, I would swing them from left to right. 

It’s like my body was subconsciously telling me how to cope. Also, I think being an intuitive eater helped me function normally all along, since I would always listen to my body’s craving for salty foods and gatorade.

And I also have a history as a child when my vision would briefly turn white and my legs would weaken to the point of collapsing, but never losing consciousness. The last episode happened in 2018 and I was doing fine before I was hospitalized, so I’m blaming it all on caffeine 😾

…oh, what's that? Did you think you were rid of me? Did you think there was nothing more to post? Did you think I’d resist the siren song of seeding magic numbers? Paraphrasing [Coach Nat in the post game presser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euCJPc1Nqys) last night, no time for celebration, we’ve got to press on with more magic numbers!

Yesterday the Valkyries had the stage to themselves to clinch and today the rest of the 5th through 9th place cohort gets to play.

**Current Standing**:

* Current Magic Number to Clinch: **0** (Woooo! G! S! V! G! S! V!)
* Current Valkyrie’s Seeding: **6 of 13**
* Current Magic Number to Clinch 7th Seed: **1**
* Current Magic Number to Clinch 6th Seed: **2**
* Current Highest Possible Finish w/o help: **6th**
* Current Highest Possible Finish with help: **5th**

**Today’s Important Games** (featuring teams in 5th-9th place):

* **(9) LAS @ ATL** \- Every game for the Sparks is do or die from here on out, they need to win out AND get help to make it in. The Dream handled the Sparks pretty cleanly two nights ago and we’re returning to the scene in Atlanta for the rematch
* **CHI @ (8) IND** \- The Fever are on a bit of a slide but need to start winning out if they want to keep control. They are motivated to clinch but the Sky have played convincingly in the spoiler role for a few games
* **(5) NYL @ (7) SEA** \- This one is pretty big, a Liberty(biberty) win further positions them as the (very) likely 5th seed. The Storm’s position is super volatile as they only have two remaining games yet they only play competing seeds in those games. Their probabilities are relatively even across 6-9th and winning lets them keep the already limited control of their situation going into their final game against the Valkyries (more on that below). Frankly it is tough to pin down what either team winning means at the moment, but if you were picking just one game to tune into I’d recommend this one as they both need the win

**Notes**:

* With the Valkyries clinching there are two spots left for the Storm, Fever and Sparks
* The Storm and the Fever need to win out to clinch, 2 and 3 wins respectively.
* The Valkyries are down to their last three games, while it might be tempting to think about the two against the Lynx, **the reality is our game against the Storm is by far the most important game to us on the entire remaining WNBA slate**. This game will be a two win swing in the standings for the winner and if the Storm win we have to work our way farther down the convoluted tie break resolution flow. This means this game is a hammer worth 2-2.5x more than any other game and that is pretty deterministic this late in the season
* There are **13** games left that can influence the Valkyries final standings, three of them happen tonight
* There are **2** games left where the 5th - 9th place teams play each other, one is tonight
* Opponent Remaining Schedules:
   * Liberty(biberty) remaining games (**3**): @Storm, Mystics, @Sky
   * Storm remaining games (**2**): Liberty(biberty), Valkyries
   * Fever remaining games (**3**): Sky, @Mystics, Lynx
   * Sparks remaining games (**4**): @Dream, Wings, @Mercury, Aces  

**Valkyrie’s Remaining Schedule:**

* **MIN @ GSV** \- Sat Sept 6th, 5:30pm PT
* **GSV @ SEA** \- Tues Sept 9th, 7:00pm PT

I figured it's time to stop messing around and get a proper stand mixer, but holy crap the options are overwhelming. I've been researching for weeks and my head is spinning worse than my old mixer's dying motor.

Everyone and their mother seems to swear by KitchenAid, and I get it - they're everywhere, they look gorgeous on the counter, and apparently they last forever. My grandmother still has one from the 80s that works perfectly. But then I started looking at prices and nearly choked on my coffee. The Professional series is pushing $500+ and I'm wondering if that's just paying for the name at this point.

Then I discovered there's this whole world of alternatives I never knew existed. Bosch Universal Plus keeps popping up in forums with people saying it handles bread dough way better than KitchenAid. There's Ankarsrum from Sweden that apparently has some completely different mixing mechanism that's supposed to be amazing. Cuisinart has models that look identical to KitchenAid but cost half as much. And don't even get me started on the commercial options like Hobart that some home bakers somehow justify buying.

My main uses would be bread dough (I make sourdough weekly), cookie dough, whipping cream, occasional pasta making, and maybe grinding meat if I get the attachments. I bake for my family of four plus I usually make extra loaves for neighbors. Not running a bakery or anything, but I do use it 3-4 times a week minimum.

Budget-wise, I could stretch to $400-500 if it's really worth it and will last decades, but if I can get something solid for $200-300 that would be ideal. I just don't want to cheap out and regret it, but I also don't want to overpay for features I'll never use or a brand name that doesn't actually translate to better performance.

What are you all using? Are the expensive models really that much better for home baking? Anyone regret going cheap or regret splurging? I'm especially curious about reliability - I see horror stories about newer KitchenAids not being built like they used to be, with plastic gears and motors burning out. Is that just internet complaining or a real issue?

Also wondering about bowl capacity - is 5-6 quarts enough or do you really need those massive 7-8 quart bowls? Counter space isn't really an issue for me, but I don't want something so huge it's overkill for making a single batch of cookies.

Would love to hear real experiences from people who actually use their stand mixers regularly, not just reviews from people who make cookies twice a year at Christmas. What would you buy if you were starting fresh today?",3,1757087959.0,buyforlifetips,3,1.0,False

1n9934s,https://i.redd.it/5qxqzep3cdnf1.jpeg,Things I don't like in omegaverse,"Let me start by saying two things:

a) I actually like Omegaverse, I can't remember the last time I read something that *wasn't* Omegaverse.

b) Think of this as a vent, not a ""people shouldn't write about this and that."" I just finished 10k words for the first chapter of a fanfic I came up with after a week of searching for anything that would suit my taste so I'm a little frustrated



  
So:

1. Every time I see the ""this omega is so  different than the others and doesn't want children and wants to rebel and they understands how oppressed omegas are"" theme tagged as ""non-traditional omegaverse,"" I'm surprised. At this point, I really feel like ""an omega who likes feminine things and wants children"" would be more non-traditional.
2. i miss the days when ""omega = pussy"" wasn't so common, so people tagged it. Like, I still prefer boypussy over intersex omegas, but I miss  self-lubed asses lol. But now I've noticed that so many people just don't tag genitals, but only ""omega character x"" and sometimes it kills my mood so much 
3.  not a huge fan of all the alpha/alpha, omega/omega, alpha/beta dynamics, like every time I tried to read about these dynamics I really kept thinking ""does it have to be abo? because I really don't feel like it has to be abo. you literally could have put this in any other au and make them just a same-sex couple."". I literally just recently read a fanfiction where alphas who bonded with other alphas stopped going into rut and they  acted like regular people and now there was also regular homophobia and I was like ""this is literally just butch4butch""
4. I also don't like the whole ""you don't know if you're alpha, beta, or omega until a certain age"" thing. Like, okay, I have a feeling it could be interesting, but so many authors just go with the ""yes, this guy who acted like an alpha for 20 years, looked like an alpha, and functioned like an alpha in society turns out to be an omega, and everyone suddenly turns away from him and they get angry when he doesn't/ know how to act like a stereotypical omega and no one questions it"" trope.   like again, I think it could be interesting if someone stopped and wrote it like ""yes, it's a bit weird that after years of treating this character this way, we suddenly expect them to be the opposite"", but so many authors just treat it like angst for 1-5 chapters, and then it's like ""well, a week has passed, our new omega has learned to be an omega so anyway"" or ""the alpha taught him and now he's okay"" or ""well, he's still a bit sad, but he's doing better now soooooo.... we are starting the pregnancy angst stages!!!!!""
5. On the other hand, ""ohhh, this guy who looks like an omega and acts like one suddenly turns out to be an omega"" doesn't appeal to me either. It just makes me roll my eyes. I really prefer it when they know this from birth. And when they can't change this. 
6. When an omega male cannot impregnate women or men, but women who are alpha can still get pregnant. Like, I've read so many lucemond and jacegon fanfics where two men were seen as a normal couple as long as they were alpha/omega and omegas experienced misogyny, but Rhaenyra was alpha and her eventual relationship with omega!Alicent was still treated as taboo and there was a lot of homophobia and.... that wasn't even necessary??? Like, just let her be omega if u still want her to be in bad position??? I don't know, it just annoys me how many fanfics are like ""yes, all alphas are better... unless they're female. Then we treat them like omegas. And they still get pregnant. And they don't really have any of the typical alpha behaviors, but at the same time, omega's biology is completely upside down."" and... you don't even write f/f or m/f.  it's m/m, women are only secondary characters.... just let them have it... let them be alpha....
7.  I know the omegaverse doesn't have rules, but I swear, every time I read a beta-focused story from someone who says ""we need to focus on betas"" or ""more justice for betas""... it really doesn't need to be abo. They could really be regular people in coffee shop au and nothing change
8. I don't like fluff, platonic, or anything like that.   this trope doesn't work for me at all with sfw & not romantic  stuff. 
9. It's actually more of a problem with webcomics and manhwas, but I really don't like the idea  normal alphas/omegas  and ""dominants alphas/omegas"". And this whole thing with all the sigmas, enigmas, etc. It's just too much for me, and most of the time I really feel like ""normal alpha"" could just be beta, and sigma/engima/delta is just alpha ""but cooler"" 



I think that's all

After 25+ years of MDI I'm preparing to move to the pump, but wanted to dial in my long-acting based basal rates just to have a good foundation before the move, and haven't done any basal testing in some time.   
 
Right now I'm still using Levemir (RIP) with a spit dose (15 morning, 9 night), and it works well with its minor peak to keep me at decent numbers through the night until I'm actually up and on the go, but I do need a couple units of short acting (Humalog) just after I actually wake up/with my morning long acting injection to keep my levels steady whether or not I eat breakfast or have any coffee.  
    
The rise isn't hitting me at 5am or anything (but maybe because Levemir has a mild peak at 6-8hrs and I tend to inject it around 11PM) but instead right after I'm conscious, generally between 7AM and 8AM. This morning I was up a bit earlier so my alarm went off at 6:30AM and you can see it start to tick up. I held off in the name of basal testing but cracked as it got near 10mmol/l and added just 1 unit.   
  
  
Two questions:  
  
1. Is it at all effective as a 'basal' test if I'm preventatively intervening with short acting when I wake up (I guess this isn't a real question as I know the answer to this. No. It's part of my daily routine but it's not basal. :/ )  
  
2. If I increase my Levemir before bed, I tend to go low in the night. I want to be able to not only fast until noon, but go without any short acting in the morning to get a proper test.  Do you think changing when I take the evening dose is the move?   
  
I've also picked up an rx for Basaglar in anticipation of Levemir's discontinuation at the end of this year. Perhaps better to try messing about with that instead. I prefer splitting a dose for flexibility so hoping I can make Basaglar work on a split too (though my endo suggested backing down on my dosage with it.)",1,1757087834.0,diabetes_t1,0,1.0,False

I have left from those shelves: a bunch of (software) CDs that I need to see what's on them and whether they're worth keeping, music CDs (one of which I _have_ to keep because it was personally autographed 😁), Nintendo DS games that are in the same stage of ""play and donate"" as some of my Switch games, and assorted collectibles that I haven't made up my mind about.

By ""collectibles"" I mean both the gaming figurines and similar that have no sentimental value but are cool to look at... and also cultural figures that I got (courtesy of family friends I'm sure due to the countries involved, it's been too many years to remember properly) when my dad was in the military and we lived in Germany. For that second one I still have a set of nesting dolls and an elephant that I think came from Sri Lanka. Not sure if they have sentimental value either: they kinda function as souvenirs of ""I used to live in Germany"" but little else.

The collectibles are currently in a wooden box on one of my cube organizers: I'll either get rid of them due to having nowhere to display them and no compelling need to try... or replace that box with an acrylic see-through tray.

Edit: vaguely related but in addition to the floating shelves my family got rid of enough water bottles, coffee mugs, and Instant Pot accessories to fill my trunk for a trip to the thrift store... plus one box that wouldn't fit. Normally I just go when I've filled _a_ box because it takes a month or more to have one ready to go. Still gotta reorganize those cupboards (for repapering the shelves) and see if there's anything else to get rid of, but there's less stuff to organize now.",8,1757087829.0,declutter,1,1.0,False

I have started to experience PVC recently and am still learning about what they are, so my apologies if I don’t get the terminology right or if this has already been covered in previous posts. I basically have no idea what to do next and am looking for some advice. 

I had my first noticeable bout of PVC on 8/27. I was sitting on the couch and watching TV around 9:30pm when my Apple Watch warned me that my heart rate had fallen below 40bpm for 10 minutes. I received a second warning after that. During this time, I experienced chest tightness, difficult breathing and lightheadedness. I considered going to the ER but decided against it because of the long wait time. I went to bed shortly after, and things were fine the next morning. 

On 8/28, I saw my doctor about the issue and he ordered blood work and a chest x-ray (which I will be doing later today). Later that night, again around 9:30pm while I was sitting down, the PVC kicked up again. I decided to go to the ER this time because I was worried about having a heart attack or stroke. At the hospital, I did blood work, an ECG, a chest x-ray and CT scan. All came back clear. I ended up staying overnight and the nurse mentioned that I had bigeminy when she looked at my vitals. However, the ER doctor didn’t seem to think much of it when he looked at my sinus rhythm readings later that morning, and I was discharged that day. 

I did not experience any further significant PVC  again until last night (9/4). Again, it started the same way (in the evening, while I was sitting down) and lasted on and off for around 1.5 hours this time. I was eventually able to fall asleep, but did have to get up and walk around whenever the shortness of breath got to be too much.

A bit more background:
- I am 42M without any significant health issues that I know of. 
- I am not overweight and my exercise level is decent (I go to the gym a few times a week and go for almost daily walks). 
- My diet could be better, but my blood work from 8/28 did not show anything concerning in terms of sodium levels, etc. I typically drink a cup of coffee in the morning. 
- I did an echocardiogram earlier this week. 

All of this has really increased my stress and anxiety. Because the PVC started happening so suddenly, and all the tests I’ve done so far have come back clear, I have no idea what is causing it. My doctor is away until the end of September, so I won’t be able to see him for a follow up until then. In the meantime, does anyone have advice for what I can do to manage the PVC when they happen?",1,1757087701.0,PVCs,0,1.0,False

Light the incense, grab the body oils, and strap in folks: it's time for our weekly meeting of memes, flirting, and general debauchery. I hope you all had great weeks and are excited to vibe with your favorite ""definitely-not-a-sex-cult"" cult leader. 

My week has been unremarkable and quiet. Busy with work, mostly. Hopefully you all have something a bit more interesting to update the gathered masses on. (if not, just say how much you love me, thanks--and really mean it okay, I just really need someone to admit they have a huge crush on me and have been putting off asking me out on a date because they're so intimidated by how cool and popular and smart I am like damn is this really that much to ask??)

If you're a lurker or new, be sure to introduce yourself, ask questions, and generally make your presence known in our subreddit's weekly meme thread. I love learning about all ya'll, hearing about your polyam journeys, and generally just being a silly little guy with you in these threads. We'll be happy to have you (in more ways than one AM I RIGHT OR AM I RIGHT?).

Rat Union Question(s) of the Week: 

* For those of you who consider yourself polyam vets: What is a piece of advice you would give to someone new to the lifestyle that you think would most help set them up for long term success?
* For those of you who consider yourself polyam newbies: What is a question or situation you would like advice on from those with more experience in the lifestyle?
* And, as always, you may treat these as my personal office hours if you have any questions for your fearless leader directly. <3

But I just need to vent because these increasing prices have ruined my short-and-long term savings plans and I’m not sure what to do. 


My goal was to put away $400/paycheck into savings. Half of that would go to my 9-month emergency fund and the other half would go to various sinking funds.


I made extreme cuts to my budget in order to be able to save this money. It’s only temporary, until my emergency fund is fully funded. And then I could enjoy a little more spending money after that. 

But over the course of a few months, my condo fee, tax escrow, grocery bill, and electric bill all increased so significantly that I can no longer put away enough to make a dent in my savings goals. 


I have to drop any “fun” sinking funds like vacation and my Sunny Day fund (like a rainy day fund, I can use it if I just need a Me Day). And I had to seriously cut my emergency fund savings. 


I only have maybe $20 of personal spending per month now as it is. I have cut all subscriptions, coffee and dining out already. My living situation is hard to get out of in this economy. I have a townhouse with a low interest rate. The condo fees have increased 150% since I moved in 10 years ago but if I were to buy a new place, I would be spending way more money for a place that was arguably even worse than my current place.

I find it easier to post about my challenge and organize my shorter and longer thoughts on Substack, so I will probably use that platform in the future. If you are still interested in this challenge, please, let me know, so you can either join me or you can ask your questions. 

# A recent update:

I’m back with an update on Day 27 of my Operation Joy Challenge.

First, let me reassure you—I did *not* disappear. My original plan was to write more frequently, but I realized something: I prefer to share when I’ve gathered enough insights and experiences around a topic, rather than posting just to post. That said, if you enjoy these updates and would like to hear from me more frequently, let me know—I’d be happy to share smaller reflections too.

# What’s happened in the past 10 days?

* **Books, books, books.** I’ve completed *10 books in 27 days*, ranging from cozy novels to deep dives into coffee culture, crypto, and AI. It feels like my curiosity muscle is working overtime, and I love it.
* **Fitness progress.** My workout sessions are paying off—I’m getting so close to achieving a perfect front split! (Stay tuned, I’ll definitely share when that milestone happens.)
* **Business reflections.** Out of all the areas in my challenge, business has been the slowest to develop. But here’s what I realized: this summer needed to be a *me season*. While it’s true that you can close deals anytime of the year, I used these months to refocus on myself. And I don’t think that time was wasted. With September here, I’m ready to shift gears and bring more energy back into my professional life.

# My Main Discovery: Main Character Energy

You’ve probably seen the phrase *“main character energy”* floating around on social media, often contrasted with being an *NPC (non-playing character).* But here’s the thing—I think these quick reels and TikToks only scratch the surface.

As a psychologist and business coach, my passion lies in **self-leadership**. And I’ve come to realize: **being the main character in your story is at the core of self-leadership.**

Think about it for a moment. Are you truly the main character of your life—or are you unintentionally slipping into a supporting role in someone else’s story? Wouldn’t life be more fulfilling if you stepped into your own light and fully claimed the spotlight you deserve?

# Creating Your Main Character

If you want to play with this idea, try sketching out your *main character profile.* Here are some guiding questions to get started:

* **Values** – What principles guide your decisions?
* **Mission & Vision** – What do you stand for, and where are you headed?
* **Goals** – What quests are you currently on?
* **Strengths & Weaknesses** – What powers do you already have, and what are your weak points?
* **Skills** – In what areas are you highly skilled or even gifted? What are your *“weapons”* in your game of life?
* **Path of Growth** – Imagine your life as a video game. What is your current level and what level-ups are waiting for you? What is the lowest and highest rank in your game? What challenges do you need to overcome to move to the next level?
* **Identity** – What unique traits define you as a main character?
* **Allies** – Who are the people supporting you along your journey?

# Inspiration from Stories

If building your “main character” feels tricky at first, here’s a simple exercise: make a list of novels, movies, or anime/manga where the main character really resonated with you. Then ask yourself:

* Why am I drawn to these characters?
* What traits or choices make them inspiring?
* How could they influence the creation of *my* main character?

Chances are, the characters you admire reflect values or qualities you want to embody yourself.

# A Powerful Question

Let me leave you with this reflection:

👉 **If you are the main character—and you are also writing the script of your life—what would you do today or in the current situation you are in?**

Your story is yours to lead and you already have everything you need to take the next step in becoming the main character.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. 
If you really do want to join it just ask around at the meetup.

Each one of their recent meetings wound up being a close game, and tonight should also prove to be a  real nail-biter.

1n98kd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatItsLike/comments/1n98kd4/explore_if_lysol_disinfectant_wipes_truly_clean/,Explore if Lysol Disinfectant Wipes Truly Clean Every Surface,"Testing out the Lysol 59909 Disinfectant Wipes over the past few weeks has felt almost like having a mini arsenal against germs right at my fingertips. As someone who runs a household that’s constantly bustling—thanks to kids, pets, and maybe my occasional clumsiness with spilling coffee—I rely heavily on cleaning products that don’t just promise to work but actually do the heavy lifting. This pack of multi-surface antibacterial wipes has quickly climbed to the top spot on my cleaning essentials list. They’ve not only proven their worth in sanitizing but have managed to save me time, energy, and even my sanity.

**Ease of Use That Makes Cleaning a Breeze**  
These wipes scream convenience, packed in a cylindrical container with an easy-to-use pop-top design. While cleaning my kitchen countertops or tackling that mystery goo kids leave behind on the dining table, I found it extremely easy to grab a single wipe without half the roll unraveling onto the floor. Each sheet has the right level of moistness—not too wet where it leaves puddles, but sufficient enough to tackle sticky or grimy messes effortlessly. I even passed one to my son to clean up some pencil marks on his desk, and it worked like magic. Minimal adult supervision required for that one.

**Strong Cleaning Power**  
One of the **boons** of the Lysol wipes is how robust they are in cleaning power. I tested them on a variety of surfaces, from kitchen counters, bathroom sinks, and door handles, to my tablet’s screen after my toddler colored on it. Not only did they handle grease, grime, and stray spaghetti sauce like champs, they claimed to eliminate 99.9 percent of viruses and bacteria—including tough ones like Influenza A Virus and staph. It’s not often I’m this impressed, but they had me nodding in approval after every use. They even claim to remove more than 95 percent of allergens like pet dander and dust mites, something I appreciate as a dog owner. My dog shed an ungodly amount of fur last week, and these wipes tackled the mess and made the surfaces feel fresh and fur-free.

**Check Lysol 59909 price on Amazon.**  

**Durability and Sustainability**  
These are three times stronger than your average paper towel, and it shows. Unlike flimsy, thin wipes that rip at the first hint of resistance, these held up even while scrubbing dried-on food from my stove. Each wipe has a thick texture, making it efficient for cleaning large areas without needing to use a second or third one. On the sustainability side, I can’t claim these are eco-friendly since they’re single-use, but if you’re weighing environmental guilt against the need for quick disinfection, these can’t be ignored.

**Not Just for Home Use**  
What shocked me was how versatile these wipes are beyond the home. I threw them into my travel bag, and they became my go-to for wiping airplane tray tables, restaurant high chairs, and even some questionably sticky remote controls at a vacation rental. Compact enough to carry around, these wipes have now solidified their position as an essential part of my travel cleaning kit. I also passed one to a coworker last week who swore her office keyboard was a germy disaster. She’s since texted me asking where to buy them.

**Fragrance: A Hit or Miss**  
The lemon and lime blossom scent is refreshing without being overpowering. Frankly, I’m not a fan of anything too perfumy, so this subtle aroma worked well for me. However, a few family members found it lingering a bit longer than they’d like. If a purely ""unscented"" option existed, I’d likely grab that for sensitive noses.

**Drawbacks**  
Even though these wipes are fantastic at cleaning and disinfecting, I did notice a few **shortcomings**:  
- They’re not suitable for certain delicate materials, like unfinished wood or shining stainless steel, as they can leave streaks behind.  
- The price might feel a bit steep to those who typically stick to paper towels for cleaning.  
- As much as I love the wipes, the dispensing system could use an upgrade. By the halfway mark, pulling one wipe out starts to require questionable finger gymnastics that no one appreciates mid-cleaning.

**Peer Products**  
Compared to generic brand wipes, the Lysol wipes stand leagues ahead in efficiency and reliability. Competing brands sometimes feel overly watered down or don’t have the same level of scrubbing power. Others, like Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, perform admirably, especially with their range of scents, but I found Lysol slightly ahead in terms of allergen removal. Frankly, Clorox didn’t seem as tough on pet messes, and they marginally lag behind when it comes to removing dried-on grime without tearing. Still, both are industry giants, and choice here often boils down to personal preference.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Despite their undeniable quality and effectiveness, the investment into these wipes is worth some thought. They offer good value, especially as they reduce the need for multiple cleaning products—essentially replacing disinfectant sprays and paper towels in one go. For someone like me, who despises juggling 15 different bottles and rags, these wipes provide a compact, efficient solution. Still, for budget shoppers, they might not feel as wallet-friendly as lower-tier brands that lack the same cleaning power. This is truly a case of getting what you pay for.

1n98jzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bluenilelivery/comments/1n98jzs/the_blue_nile_delivery_that_made_my_mom_cry/,The Blue Nile Delivery That Made My Mom Cry,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share something that happened in my family recently that’s a little different from the usual engagement stories. It’s about my parents, forty years of marriage, and a surprise that still makes me smile.

My mom has worn the same simple, polished gold band since the day she married my dad. It’s thin and unadorned, and she’s never once taken it off. It’s a symbol of everything they built together from nothing. But over the years, I’d notice her occasionally pausing at jewelry store windows, her eyes lingering on diamond eternity bands. She’d never say anything, but I knew she admired them.

For their 40th anniversary this year, my dad and I decided to go in on a gift together. He wanted to get her one of those bands—something beautiful and lasting that she would never buy for herself. There was just one big problem: my dad is wonderfully, endearingly hopeless when it comes to anything online that isn’t checking the weather or reading the news. The thought of him navigating an online jewelry store, with all its filters and specs, was a recipe for frustration.

I live across the country, so I couldn't just take him to a store. I needed a solution that would empower him, not overwhelm him. That’s when I suggested we look at Blue Nile together over a video call.

It was honestly a game-changer. I shared my screen and walked him through it. The clean website layout didn’t confuse him. We used the filters together: “Yellow Gold,” “Round Diamond,” “Eternity.” He loved that he could see hundreds of options side-by-side, read the clear descriptions, and see the high-quality videos. It wasn’t a stressful task anymore; it felt like a mission we were on together. He’d point to one and say, “Ooh, now that one has some sparkle to it, doesn’t it?” Hearing him get excited was half the fun.

He finally settled on a gorgeous half-eternity band. “I don’t want her to have to take it off to garden,” he said, and I just melted. That’s my dad—practical and romantic all at once.

He placed the order himself, his finger hovering dramatically over the mouse button. The ring was delivered to their house a few days later in that sleek, recognizable box. He hid it in his sock drawer for a week, which he was terribly proud of.

On the morning of their anniversary, he made her coffee and pancakes, just like he always does. As she was sitting at the kitchen table, he slid the small box across the table. She opened it, and her hands flew to her mouth. And then… she cried. Happy tears, the best kind. She immediately slid it on next to her original wedding band. “They’re a set,” she kept saying, her voice all wobbly. “They were always meant to be a set.”

The best part? My dad now tells all his friends at the golf club that he “found the perfect ring on the internet.” He’s a tech hero now. I let him have all the credit, of course.

This was more than just a fast delivery or a beautiful piece of jewelry. It was a way for my dad to navigate a modern problem and give a gift that was deeply personal. It was about honoring their past while celebrating their present. Blue Nile didn’t just deliver a ring; they delivered a moment we’ll all remember forever.

Thanks for letting me share. I’d love to hear if anyone else has used Blue Nile Livery for a special anniversary or non-engagement gift.",1,1757086613.0,Bluenilelivery,0,1.0,False

https://www.reddit.com/r/KelleyWolf/s/5ia3YMdog0

But my last post on this is going to me ""Cricket"" story. 

Only it's my ""Sand dollar"" dollar story. As many of you know from the two Megathreads, my late husband suffered a manic psychotic break in his late 40's. I'm not going to rehash all of that. But I'm going to fast forward to the sand dollars part. During his mania he took a trip to Portland, Oregon and while there became obsessed with collecting sand dollars. He had the grand idea about finding one for every single member in the family tree. And he kept running around telling everyone about it. With such passion. Well everyone rolled their eyes and just ignored him pretty much. Me? I just listened. Mainly because I felt scared and confused and of course I couldn't get a word in. But also I thought it was endearing in a way too. It's hard to explain. 

So he came back with a suitcase filled with sand dollars and no one really cared. Which broke my heart. So I made sure to spread them around the house. On the coffee table. On the walls. They were huge and beautiful. Any my husband loved this. He didn't think I was mocking him. It meant a lot to him. You see, here's the thing, after he psychotic break, he didn't look back on it like you or I would. It was all still real in his head. 

Fast forward to this month, I bought a gold Denny Wong sand dollar ring. Took me months to pay it off. And it means the world to me because they meant so much to him. Even after he got stabilized. 

So us talking about what Kelley loves or adopting some of her phrases, from afar, well that's not us making fun of someone in a mental health crisis. We are all desperately wanting a stranger that we don't know to get better. While also embracing some of her favorite things or sayings. Some of us happen to just love her sayings and style and it is nothing more than that. 

We are also talking seriously about mental health. We are doing **both**. 

This is our vibe. This is our sub where camaraderie is *just* as important to us as talking about mental health and Kelley's well being. Please don't mock our campfire chats. Goodness. Is that not good for mental health as well? We were all drawn here for different reasons. And a lot of us share what the entire Wolf family, including Kelley, is going through right now.

Initially when we started dating during our early mba days the difference in our personalities felt cute. My loud personality vs his quiet self it felt like we balanced each other out but over time it feels suffocating and like a deal breaker.
I like to wear hoodies, go to techno events and concerts, try new cafes and i dream of traveling the world. When i met him i was a heart broken 21 year old we started dating within 3 weeks of meeting and it felt amazing despite our fights. He pretended to like coffee for me but as time passes he is becoming extremely reluctant to do anything his idea of quality times is eating takeout, cuddling and taking a nap. While this sounds comforting my idea is sometimes wanting to go out and have fun. I have been yapping about conjuring movie nonstop for 4 months while he initially said yes now that we were suppose to book tickets he is just so unbothered and uninterested. 
He doesn’t loke hoodies, doesn’t watch movies in theatre, doesn’t listen to music, doesn’t celebrate birthday, hates fancy cafes, only likes Indian food, doesn’t like car drives, doesn’t like f1, hates the idea of shopping or laugh at my lame jokes. 
Basically everything i like he somehow finds it boring, uninteresting or annoying.
While i try to find a middle ground the only common thing between us is we want to work in real estate industry post mba. 
I love him and don’t want to break up but at the same time i feel like i m alone even when i have a bf.
I m not saying he changes himself for me but i want him to sometimes take interest in thongs i like. I need advice as this is my first relationship and the only experience i had before this was a messy situation-ship when i was 19. ",3,1757086505.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False
1n98hjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1n98hjz/review_of_the_classic_bleu_de_chanel_edp_since/,Review of the classic Bleu De Chanel EDP. Since we're all talking Bleu De Chanel,"Seeing everyone over here posting about L'Exclusif, which I haven't tried, I thought I'd go back to my long languishing decant of Bleu De Chanel EDP and revisit the absolute classic

**The GOAT.** \#1 on every “safe blind buy” list. Helped define the “blue” category that took its name from it. Arguably the most iconic men’s scent of all time.

I always keep and refill a 5 ml decant that I almost never wear. Not because it isn’t amazing, but because in a bigger wardrobe, something else usually feels a bit more interesting. If I owned just one cologne, this would probably be it. In a rotation, it sees less use.

**TL;DR:** It’s the GOAT for a reason. Smooth, universally appealing, fresh, and impeccably clean. It leaves a light, slightly musky, lightly woody scent on skin and clothes long after the obvious top notes fade.

The blend is stunning. It takes you on a journey, and at every stage you smell “Bleu,” not individual notes. Even **Fragrantica**, **Basenotes**, and **Parfumo** don’t agree on the exact note list.

I honestly can’t think of a scenario where this wouldn’t work or a person it wouldn’t suit.

**OTOH,** its success is its own worst enemy. Everything now smells *sort of* like it. It’s still the best, but less unique than it once was because everything from hotels to shampoos hint at Bleu. You don’t NEED to own this, unless you’re really looking for a single scent to wear everywhere.

**Rating:**

* **Opening:** 4.3/5
* **Drydown:** 4.2/5
* **Overall:** **8.5/10**

# Opening

Wonderfully fresh and clean. Grapefruit peeks through if you go looking, but with the aldehydes it almost reads like **cantaloupe-cool.** It’s more *refreshing* than overtly citrusy. In fact it’s refreshing AF without being a cliché “freshie.” A hint of pink **pepper** adds sparkle without shouting PEPPER (this isn’t Sauvage).

# Heart

Around **45 minutes**, the **ginger** arrives, spicy-ish, exquisitely blended, handing off from the pepper to keep interest up. “Fresh-spicy” is the vibe. Nothing perfumey or cloying; it smells like someone well-groomed who has their life together.

By **90 minutes**, the citrus is gone. There’s still a modest aura. **Sandalwood** smooths everything out, but the woods are so well-blended they’re hard to pick apart. There’s a touch of “shower-gel clean,” likely from lingering aldehydes + jasmine lift over those silky woods.

# Drydown

In the base a **clean, gauzy incense** shows up. It’s just enough to add interest without disrupting the clean accord. Chanel calls it **woody**; compared with truly woody styles like **Dior Homme (2020)** or **Terre d’Hermès**, this reads cleaner and less wood-forward. **Tonka/vanilla** keep the finish soft and smooth rather than sweet.

Modern-masculine in a clean way, more **Gillette ad** than This Is Sparta or Marlboro Man.

At **6 hours:** slight wood and a wisp of incense. Not quite skin-scent, but you need to be close.

At **7 hours:** smooth wood-musk. A pleasant skin-musk trace lingers for hours.

# Performance on me

**Good.** \~3 hours of a noticeable bubble, then closer-to-skin. About **8 hours** total on skin.

# Versatility

Year-round. I honestly can’t think of a place this doesn’t work. The single most versatile scent I can name.

* **75 years old?** Bleu de Chanel
* **17 years old?** Bleu de Chanel
* **CEO?** Bleu de Chanel
* **Plumber?** Bleu de Chanel
* **Wedding?** Bleu de Chanel
* **Beach?** Bleu de Chanel
* **Patio hangout?** Bleu de Chanel
* **Night out with the boys?** Bleu de Chanel
* **Gym (light hand)?** Bleu de Chanel
* **First date?** Bleu de Chanel
* **50th anniversary?** Bleu de Chanel
* **Getting married?** Bleu de Chanel

# Use cases

**Daily driver** for office, travel days, “meet the parents,” first dates, investor coffees. Really, anything where *polished and trustworthy* beats *loud and daring*.

# Vibe

**Clean, confident, well-groomed, maybe has a six-pack.** Not trying too hard. Unmistakably put-together.

# Blind-buy safe?

**Yes.** This may be the definition of ""blind-buy safe."" It's the blueprint for “blue.” If you like fresh, you’re safe. It literally smells “blue” when you smell it.

# Overall take

For **effortless, musky-fresh-woody, and clean** that stays classy in every scenario, **Bleu de Chanel EDP** nails it. It’s not the most *characterful* bottle on the shelf, but it’s the one that **never misfires.** Sometimes that’s exactly what you want.

Small background, I've NEVER but once in middle school asked a woman out. I've always been asked. Wife has a partner, and wife and I have a son.  The spark flourished for me, when she invited me out to the bar one night. I told her I will be there later, because I have to take my wife's partner home first. She got curious, and I told her my wife and I were poly, and her face is what did it. It wasn't disgust, more like.. curious acceptance. 

To the meat, I came back from my Grey Day vacation, and when I finally got back to work, I'm not sure what happened. I felt such a strong magnetic force PULL towards her. I knew my autistic ass was gonna fall for it really hard. It seemed like my mind and body *missed* her. 

One day, I saw a point in our conversation to pivot to me inviting her out to one of my favorite coffee/drink spots. Before the ask, I told her I did want to know her better than I do.  She took interest, and asked where it was, but said she cant handle coffee. Which is fine, because I told her they definitely have things they like for her there. 
Nothing.

We get to work, and it's business as usual. No weirdness, no awkwardness, nothing. 

I decided to try to rekindle, not to ask,  but just to conversate some more. She doesn't reply much, and seems like she wants to put in effort to the conversation, and has even initiated a few times, but is mostly delistracted by our friend group. (I believe they all visit each other almost daily)

 I don't have time like they all do, and they've all also been friends for years. I'm basically the outsider. However, everyone does like and appreciate my presence.
I feel stuck, what do I do? She doesn't seem disturbed that I have a son, or that Im not monogamous. 

Do I keep trying to express my interest, or since I've already asked, I just cool off and just be casual?

1n98gqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1n98gqt/why_is_the_best_electric_kettle_zwilling_enfinigy/,Why is the Best Electric Kettle ZWILLING Enfinigy Worth It,"The ZWILLING 53101-201 Enfinigy Kettle was not the first electric kettle to grace my countertop, but I’ll confidently say it’s been the most stylish so far. As someone who drinks tea religiously and often finds myself boiling water for everything from oatmeal to instant noodles at odd hours, this kettle had a lot to live up to—and quite honestly, it didn’t disappoint. 

**Sleek Design That Demands Attention**  
The first thing you’ll notice about this electric kettle is its striking sleek, matte black finish. Unlike your average kitchen gadget, this kettle looks like it was made to belong in a high-end showroom. It’s lightweight yet robust, crafted from stainless steel with an elegant double-walled design, making it a beautiful addition to my kitchen. Italian designers Matteo Thun and Antonio Rodriguez really nailed the aesthetic on this one. It felt like upgrading from a trusty sedan to a luxury car. Functionality aside, it’s simply a product you’ll want to show off, not hide away.

**Performance and Daily Use**  
This kettle’s no slouch when it comes to performance. With a 1.5-liter capacity and a 1,500-watt heating element, it brings water to a boil faster than my previous model. Whether I’m steeping loose-leaf tea or prepping for French press coffee, the boiling process is consistently quick and efficient. Oh, and its ""cool touch"" double-walled feature? A lifesaver. Even when the water inside reaches scalding temperatures, the kettle’s exterior remains surprisingly cool—perfect for someone like me, whose toddler occasionally hijacks the kitchen. 

[Find the best price for ZWILLING 53101-201 on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b08ncd98hg/)  

**Advantages**  
There’s so much I enjoyed about this kettle, it’s worth highlighting a few perks:  
- The 70° lid opening prevents hot steam from rushing into your face—a small but thoughtful touch.  
- The seamless stainless-steel interior makes cleaning an absolute breeze. No gunk, no fuss.  
- It features an integrated cable winder at the base, which kept my counter neat (and also avoided the spaghetti-situation of cords).  
- It’s German-engineered with a sense of precision I’ve come to trust in products from the region.

**Drawbacks**  
While I’ve generally been happy with this product, there are a couple of critiques that I can’t overlook:  
- The lid isn't fully detachable, which means deep-cleaning it can sometimes become a more involved process.  
- At 2.87 pounds, while it’s lighter than expected, refilling it with water adds a bit of heft that some users might find cumbersome.  
- Lastly, the metric-only temperature markings on the interior could confuse anyone who primarily uses imperial systems. Not a deal-breaker, but a detail worth noting.  

**Alternative Products**  
Speaking of competitors, the ZWILLING kettle stands head-to-head with models like the Breville BKE820XL and the COSORI Electric Kettle. Breville, for instance, includes variable temperature options—a feature tea purists would appreciate—though it comes at a heftier price. The COSORI kettle, on the other hand, won’t burn a hole in your wallet and still delivers reliable performance, albeit lacking the premium feel and “cool-touch” benefits of the ZWILLING. In comparison, this kettle excels in safety features and minimalist design, creating a perfect balance between affordability and luxury. 

**Cost Efficiency**  
For its price, you’re paying for style, functionality, and durability all rolled into one. Is it the cheapest kettle out there? Absolutely not, but its luxurious build and excellent design justify the investment for anyone looking for long-term use. It’s one of those purchases where I feel I got “Quality for Price”—a blend of utility and a touch of indulgence for everyday life.

1n98fig,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1n98fig/does_nakii_water_pitcher_filter_really_deliver/,Does Nakii Water Pitcher Filter Really Deliver Clean Water? Full Review Inside,"The Nakii 8541940723 Water Pitcher Replacement Filter is one of those products that becomes a subtle but impactful part of everyday life. I’ve been testing it rigorously, not only for my own use but also gathering feedback from my partner, coworkers, and guests who’ve seen it in action. It's hard to imagine my kitchen routine without it now, but as with any product, there are elements to rave about and others to consider with caution.

**Initial Impressions: Style Meets Simplicity**  
This water filter has a clean and functional appearance that fits seamlessly into modern kitchens. The white exterior is minimalist, and its lightweight design (only 3.84 ounces) makes swapping out filters a breeze. Its compact size—measuring just 4.41"" x 9.02"" x 2.01""—means it conveniently fits in most pitcher setups without crowding the fridge. From a design perspective, it’s undeniably practical, though it doesn’t scream “luxury.” It’s apparent that this product favors functionality over flashiness, and I’m totally here for that balance.  

**Favorable Attributes**  
- Uses Japan-developed ACF (activated carbon fiber) technology for superior contaminant absorption.  
- Eliminates 97% of chlorine, mercury, rust, and sediment effectively.  
- Filters last for 150 gallons before replacement is necessary—much longer than standard filters.  

[Check Nakii 8541940723 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b01n3a6usi/)  

**Daily Performance: A Filter That Works Hard**  
I noticed a significant difference in water clarity and taste with this filter. Tap water in my area tends to have a slight metallic tang and visible specks on occasion, and the Nakii handles these issues remarkably well. Each time I used this filter, the water tasted crisp and clean, quite reminiscent of bottled water brands. ACF technology is a real game-changer in this regard, ensuring water is free from unpleasant odors and contaminants without delays—it delivers 1.3 liters of filtered water in about one minute, a speed that really came in handy when guests visited.  

**Considerations While Using It**  
Despite its performance, the accompanying learning curve was a slight drawback. Any new filter tends to have a break-in period, and I had to run water through the cartridge a few times before the water came through without any fine black specks. This isn’t unique to Nakii though, as it’s a common issue with many activated carbon filters. Additionally, while ample for normal household use, extreme filtering demands (think large parties or plenty of coffee-making) may push its capacity.  

**Pros**  
- Sleek and ergonomic design that’s easy to handle.  
- Provides fresh-tasting water very quickly—perfect for busy families.  
- The long lifespan ensures cost-effectiveness over time.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Requires a short break-in period to eliminate initial carbon dust.  
- Its output may not meet the needs of extremely heavy users immediately.  

**Competing Products and Comparisons**  
During my testing, I compared this filter to Brita and ZeroWater alternatives—two heavyweight competitors in the water filter market. While Brita has the edge in brand recognition and availability, its filters don’t last as long, capping around 40 gallons. ZeroWater’s filter performs exceptionally well for heavy contaminant loads but tends to be more expensive for replacements, and its filtering time is notably slower. Nakii found a sweet spot between these—offering a much longer lifespan at 150 gallons without compromising on speed or quality. However, I’ll admit, for water with extraordinarily high hardness, ZeroWater might still be a better (albeit more expensive) fit.  

**Budget-Friendly Choice**  
Given the performance per filter, Nakii’s offering stands out in terms of cost-effectiveness. Standard filters last only about 40 gallons, so hitting 150 gallons means I’m purchasing fewer replacements, saving money and reducing waste. True, it may feel like a slightly larger investment upfront when compared to budget filters, but the long-term savings make it worthwhile for families or individuals consuming significant amounts of water.

* Is this why Isabela Ferrer (sucks?) doesn't want to be subpoenaed by Wayfarer? 

**Funny quotes:**

* On Ferrer’s filing: “Her whole response to the situation screamed entitled \[\_\_\] to me.”
* On Ferrer’s lawyer: “Aggressive and inappropriate in ways that he definitely did not need to be.”
* On Blake’s “proof” that someone was in New York: “Neat. Good for you. I’m also in Eastern time and I’m in Florida. That does not establish that someone was in New York.”
* Mocking Blake’s attempt at evidence: “She could have been in the bowels of \[\_\_\] Rhode Island by then. Maybe she went to visit Dunder Mifflin in Scranton. But good. Good for you. You did your big one with that. Nice.”
* On Justin’s character: “Dude, Justin is just a nice guy. Like, he did not ask for this kind of attention.”

**Isabella Ferrer’s Subpoena Dispute**

Lauren begins by reviewing newly unsealed documents in the Blake Lively v. Justin Baldoni case, zeroing in on Isabella Ferrer, who played the younger version of Blake’s character in It Ends With Us. A few weeks ago, Ferrer accused Justin of harassment when he attempted to subpoena her. Lauren notes that this was exaggerated because Ferrer is actually a relevant witness. Blake herself had already subpoenaed Ferrer, and she complied without resistance. Yet when Justin’s team tried, Ferrer’s lawyer fought back aggressively, filing language on the docket that Lauren calls “crazy” and “very intentional.” **According to Blake’s disclosures, Ferrer supposedly had knowledge about harassment, discriminatory actions, set conduct, production and editing processes, marketing and promotion, and even Blake’s alleged retaliation campaign. Lauren questions how Ferrer could possibly know all of that, especially about editing or creative decisions, which were far beyond her role.**

Lauren emphasizes that Ferrer and Justin were not even on set at the same time, making it unclear how Ferrer could have complaints about his alleged comments. What is clear, Lauren argues, is that Blake influenced Ferrer’s perspective. Originally, Ferrer praised Justin, calling the set a safe space and crediting him with making her experience positive. Later, when Blake began cutting Justin out of promotional events, Ferrer’s attitude shifted. Lauren recalls how Ferrer’s lawyer accused Justin of “appropriating her narrative” simply by sharing Ferrer’s old text messages praising him. Lauren finds this absurd, saying the whole filing from Ferrer’s side “screamed entitled \[\_\_\] to me.” She adds that Ferrer’s lawyer acted “aggressive and inappropriate in ways that he definitely did not need to do,” and if Ferrer is fine with that, “then I don’t really think that she’s such a great person either.”

**Jed Wallace and Jurisdiction Questions**

The video shifts to Blake’s jurisdiction battle with PR executive Jed Wallace. Blake has been trying to argue that Wallace was part of a conspiracy in New York. The unsealed documents show that Blake’s team alleged Wallace was working with Wayfair defendants in late July 2024. Lauren points out that Wallace himself declared he did not begin work until August 9, 2024, and prior to that there were only exploratory conversations. She stresses that “talking about potentially doing work and getting information about the project, that’s not actually doing any work. No contracts were signed up to that point.”

Lauren also mocks Blake’s evidence, which relies on Melissa Nathan’s messages showing she was on Eastern Time while corresponding with Wallace. Blake’s team tried to spin this as proof she was in New York. Lauren’s sarcastic take: “Neat. Good for you. I’m also in Eastern time and I’m in Florida. That does not establish that someone was in New York. She could have been in the bowels of \[\_\_\] Rhode Island by then. Maybe she went to visit Dunder Mifflin in Scranton. But good. Good for you. You did your big one with that. Nice.”

**PR Strategy and Paparazzi Narratives**

Lauren then reviews texts involving Justin’s PR team. After paparazzi photos of Justin and Emily surfaced, PR advisor Jen Abel messaged him, saying: “Paparazzi caught you and Emily out getting coffee yesterday and now you’re being labeled as the unbothered king. People are desperate for a new narrative. That’s why I think we should start peppering in normal life stuff with your socials to start to shift the narrative.” Lauren notes the irony, saying that while Justin was publicly being called “the unbothered king,” behind the scenes he was anxious and scared about how to defend himself.

Justin himself reacted to the paparazzi photos with surprise: “I had no idea that could happen in Ohio. It’s a tiny town. Should we start to be prepared for that stuff?” Jen reassured him that paparazzi were unlikely to target his children and encouraged him to just be kind if approached. Lauren comments that “dude, Justin is just a nice guy. Like, he did not ask for this kind of attention. I find it so frustrating that this is happening to him of all people. The guy really just wanted to do good with the movie.”

She also highlights a moment where Justin considered posting supportive content about victims, but Jen advised him not to post directly: “Let’s boost this instead of you posting it. Some of the comments reference Colleen romanticizing DV and we don’t want it to be interpreted as a dig at anyone. Let’s instead have third parties amplify instead of you right now.” Lauren defends this as normal PR practice, not a smear campaign.

**The Stephanie Jones and Vanzan Connection** 

Lauren closes with the broader context of how the “Vanzan” issue began. She explains that Blake’s team used the shell company Vanzan to obtain Justin’s messages with Wayfair, sourced from Stephanie Jones, Justin’s former publicist. According to Lauren, Jones accessed Jennifer Abel’s phone and leaked its contents. Blake’s publicist, Leslie Sloan, then tipped off Melissa Nathan about looming lawsuits based on texts they had already seen. Lauren stresses this happened before any Vanzan subpoena existed, meaning Blake’s team jumped the gun and spread information improperly. She says this mess “ultimately never would have happened without interference from Stephanie Jones.”",10,1757086250.0,ItEndsWithLawsuits,4,0.75,False

**Isabella Ferrer’s Subpoena Dispute**

Lauren begins by reviewing newly unsealed documents in the Blake Lively v. Justin Baldoni case, zeroing in on Isabella Ferrer, who played the younger version of Blake’s character in It Ends With Us. A few weeks ago, Ferrer accused Justin of harassment when he attempted to subpoena her. Lauren notes that this was exaggerated because Ferrer is actually a relevant witness. Blake herself had already subpoenaed Ferrer, and she complied without resistance. Yet when Justin’s team tried, Ferrer’s lawyer fought back aggressively, filing language on the docket that Lauren calls “crazy” and “very intentional.” **According to Blake’s disclosures, Ferrer supposedly had knowledge about harassment, discriminatory actions, set conduct, production and editing processes, marketing and promotion, and even Blake’s alleged retaliation campaign. Lauren questions how Ferrer could possibly know all of that, especially about editing or creative decisions, which were far beyond her role.**

Lauren emphasizes that Ferrer and Justin were not even on set at the same time, making it unclear how Ferrer could have complaints about his alleged comments. What is clear, Lauren argues, is that Blake influenced Ferrer’s perspective. Originally, Ferrer praised Justin, calling the set a safe space and crediting him with making her experience positive. Later, when Blake began cutting Justin out of promotional events, Ferrer’s attitude shifted. Lauren recalls how Ferrer’s lawyer accused Justin of “appropriating her narrative” simply by sharing Ferrer’s old text messages praising him. Lauren finds this absurd, saying the whole filing from Ferrer’s side “screamed entitled \[\_\_\] to me.” She adds that Ferrer’s lawyer acted “aggressive and inappropriate in ways that he definitely did not need to do,” and if Ferrer is fine with that, “then I don’t really think that she’s such a great person either.”

**Jed Wallace and Jurisdiction Questions**

The video shifts to Blake’s jurisdiction battle with PR executive Jed Wallace. Blake has been trying to argue that Wallace was part of a conspiracy in New York. The unsealed documents show that Blake’s team alleged Wallace was working with Wayfair defendants in late July 2024. Lauren points out that Wallace himself declared he did not begin work until August 9, 2024, and prior to that there were only exploratory conversations. She stresses that “talking about potentially doing work and getting information about the project, that’s not actually doing any work. No contracts were signed up to that point.”

Lauren also mocks Blake’s evidence, which relies on Melissa Nathan’s messages showing she was on Eastern Time while corresponding with Wallace. Blake’s team tried to spin this as proof she was in New York. Lauren’s sarcastic take: “Neat. Good for you. I’m also in Eastern time and I’m in Florida. That does not establish that someone was in New York. She could have been in the bowels of \[\_\_\] Rhode Island by then. Maybe she went to visit Dunder Mifflin in Scranton. But good. Good for you. You did your big one with that. Nice.”

**PR Strategy and Paparazzi Narratives**

Lauren then reviews texts involving Justin’s PR team. After paparazzi photos of Justin and Emily surfaced, PR advisor Jen Abel messaged him, saying: “Paparazzi caught you and Emily out getting coffee yesterday and now you’re being labeled as the unbothered king. People are desperate for a new narrative. That’s why I think we should start peppering in normal life stuff with your socials to start to shift the narrative.” Lauren notes the irony, saying that while Justin was publicly being called “the unbothered king,” behind the scenes he was anxious and scared about how to defend himself.

Justin himself reacted to the paparazzi photos with surprise: “I had no idea that could happen in Ohio. It’s a tiny town. Should we start to be prepared for that stuff?” Jen reassured him that paparazzi were unlikely to target his children and encouraged him to just be kind if approached. Lauren comments that “dude, Justin is just a nice guy. Like, he did not ask for this kind of attention. I find it so frustrating that this is happening to him of all people. The guy really just wanted to do good with the movie.”

She also highlights a moment where Justin considered posting supportive content about victims, but Jen advised him not to post directly: “Let’s boost this instead of you posting it. Some of the comments reference Colleen romanticizing DV and we don’t want it to be interpreted as a dig at anyone. Let’s instead have third parties amplify instead of you right now.” Lauren defends this as normal PR practice, not a smear campaign.",9,1757086238.0,teamjustinbaldoni,5,1.0,False
1n98ead,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n98ead,History of the Teile factory.,"Young mechanic Reinhold Erdman Teile , а German from Prussia, he came to the Russian city of Tula in the mid-1840s and began making buttons, drums and all sorts of things. In 1870, he opened a small samovar factory on Demidovskaya Street. Already in 1874, the factory became steam-powered: Teile installed a steam engine. In 1879, the factory had two steam engines, 24 and 36 horsepower. The factory's main product at that time was samovar parts, such as samovar lids. Having gotten on his feet, Reinhold married Bertha Dannevit (Benwitz), a native of Saxony, who served as a governess in the family of a colonel at the Arms Factory. Bertha, an intelligent, strong-willed woman, became an excellent housewife and assistant to her husband. The Teile family had 5 sons and a daughter, who died early. In 1879, Reinhold submitted a petition to the Department of Trade and Manufactures for approval of a sample of the stamp that he intended to put on his samovars. The factory prospered and brought in a good income. In 1883, it employed 50 people and produced goods worth 75,000 rubles. The factory produced not only various types of samovars, but also other goods: window and door hinges, stove dampers, locks, waffle molds, irons, weights, copper and cast iron castings.

In the mid-1880s, the Teile factory burned to the ground without being insured. The owner rebuilt it, but the production volumes fell. According to the 1889 register, the factory had only one 6-horsepower steam engine, the annual output was only 200 dozen samovars, and the output was worth 15,000 rubles. The factory now belonged to Berta Gustavovna, and Reinhold Adolf Teile acted as manager. The second fire made the situation even worse. Having somehow rebuilt the factory after the fire, Reinhold sold it in 1891 to Alexander Stepanovich Batashev, and became his manager, but in 1892 he broke the contract with Batashev and made the following commitments:

""...If I. Teile, having relinquished my obligations under the above-mentioned contract in relation to Mr. Batashev, I decide to open any kind of factory production, not excluding samovar production, then I deprive myself of the right not to use the name of Alexander Stepanovich Batashev on the sign, or on the products and invoices, in a word, and in what cases and expressions the name, patronymic, and surname of him, Alexander Stepanovich Batashev, not to use ... ""

Such foresight on the part of Batashev turned out to be far from superfluous: already in 1894 Teile opened a new samovar factory on Novo-Pavshinskaya Street (modern-day Komintern). In the same year, Alexander Stepanovich Batashev gave the factory on Demidovskaya Street (the factory building with annexes) for the construction of a lodging house. The new Teile factory was registered in the name of Berta Gustavovna, a temporary merchant. In 1900, Reinhold Teile was granted the title of hereditary honorary citizen.

The three older brothers, after their father's death in 1905, became the heads of the family enterprise ""Trading House of Bertha Gustavovna Teile and Sons"". Otto was in charge of the technical part, Eduard - of the work performed on the side. Rudolf - of the commercial side of the business. Under their leadership, the factory grew; in 1908 it occupied 3 dessiatines of land, employed the labor of almost 500 workers and produced 3,000 samovars per month. Among the models were both fire-burning and kerosene samovars, as well as coffee pots in the form of samovars and trays. The Teile brothers completely adopted the Russian way of life, even the spelling of their full names corresponded to the Russian tradition - with a patronymic.

In 1908, Rudolf and Otto signed an agreement with Nikolai Ivanovich Batashev to create a Trading House under the name ""Court Manufacturer, Heir of Ivan Grigorievich Batashev - Nikolai Ivanovich Batashev"". At first, only the Teile brothers were full partners of the House, having contributed 25,000 rubles each to the capital. Nikolai Ivanovich Batashev was only an investor and was not responsible for anything to either creditors or partners. A year later, Batashev contributed an additional amount, a total of 30,000 rubles, ""... recognizing the benefits of the business and for greater expansion.""

In 1910, changes were made to the contract. Now Nikolai Ivanovich Batashev was listed as the head of the company, the brothers helped him with management and commercial affairs, and each received 25% of the profit. In fact, the management was entirely in the hands of the Teile brothers. Nikolai Ivanovich was already elderly and often ill. In fact, he leased his factory and received a salary. In 1915, Batashev died and his wife, Elizaveta Nikolaevna, became the heir according to the will. In 1916, she renounced her rights as a co-owner of the company and left the Trading House, taking her husband's share. Ownership of the company completely passed into the hands of the Teile brothers. The Teile family's affairs were in excellent condition before the coup of 1917: two large samovar factories, a trading company with a branch in Moscow, a copper rolling plant in the village of Medvenka, Torkhovskaya volost, leased from the Vladimirovs. But already in February 1917, Eduard and Rudolf Teile were arrested by the Military Revolutionary Committee and imprisoned along with other Tula industrialists for refusing to pay the same committee 600 thousand rubles. The factory of the Trading House of Berta Gustavovna Teile and her sons was nationalized on March 31, 1919. In February 1919, a Board for the Management of United Samovar Factories in Tula was created with their subordination to the Central Board of ""Tsentromedi"", and Rudolf Teile was appointed head of all factories. On April 26, 1919, it was decided to merge the samovar factories with the Cartridge Plant. The former factory of the Trading House of Nikolai Ivanovich Batashev, which was owned by Rudolf, Otto and Eduard, was transformed into a hardware production facility in 1923. The factory, which belonged to Berta Teyle and her sons, was transferred to the Arms Factory. Experts acknowledged that it was ideally suited for samovar production and in this respect surpassed the former factory of the heirs of Vasily Stepanovich Batashev.",1,1757086236.0,pubhistory,0,1.0,False

How amazing (and just a little bit wild!) is it that we're now seeing AI take on tasks that once required endless hours of human toil? From crafting copy to managing data, optimizing logistics to brewing your morning coffee—automation powered by AI is showing up everywhere and making our lives a bit more magical. ✨

But under all the excitement, have you noticed how this tidal wave is not just changing *what* we do, but also *how* we think about work, creativity, and even free time?

Here are a few thought-starters:

- The repetitive, boring stuff? AI swoops in, and what used to tie us up for hours is now gone in a blink! File sorting at 4 AM? NO THANKS—all automated now.
- Small businesses and creators can punch way above their weight. One person + AI app = entire media studio, customer hotline, and marketing team rolled into one. Superpowered solopreneurs, anyone?
- Some of the tedious-old out-of-office jobs? Automated away! But hold on, doesn't that also push us toward more meaningful, creative, and fun work? Or does it leave people out in the cold?

There’s a LOT to feel happy about:

- AI makes things accessible. You don’t have to be a coding wizard to build apps, websites, or marketing campaigns… prompt, tweak, GO!
- Time-saving galore. Routine chores? Streamlined. Smart email sorting? Happening. AI-driven shopping lists? No sweat. Let’s be honest, outsourcing busywork to algorithms *feels* amazing!
- Supercharging creativity: You ask, AI delivers options you might never have considered. Instant brainstorming buddy, rhyme generator, or idea machine—your “useful assistant” *times a million*.

But hey, this is the perfect moment for us to ask big, hopeful questions:

- Are we on the cusp of an age where *everyone* can automate the boring stuff and focus on what they love?
- Could everyday creativity FLOURISH because the “grind” is handled by bots?
- Is the future going to look like a team-up between humans and AIs—each doing what they’re best at? (Can you say Dream Team?)

I’d love to hear your thoughts! 🤖💡

- Are you using AI automation for fun, work, life-hacks, or just experimenting?
- Has it made you *happier, more efficient, or maybe a little nervous*?
- If you could automate anything (seriously ANYTHING), what would you pick, and why?

1n98cnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1n98cnp/baskets_and_ese_pods_stilosa_150200/,baskets and ESE pods (Stilosa?) [€150-200],"I am in Ireland. I have a basic Shardor cone burr grinder and, while pourover, steeping, and cold brew all work reasonably well, I'd like to get into espresso as well, replacing an aging Nespresso device.

However I'd also like to retain the ""need coffee quick"" capability, so I want ESE pod support. And also I'm on a small budget (ideally within €150) as espresso is only just one of the things I'll do. But, I'd like the ability to geek out fully on it *when I have the time.*

Machines fitting my ideal budget exist in the form of the DeLonghi Stilosa, but I'm not sure which model can be made to fit all requirements. The available ones are EC.230 and EC.260.

As far as I could google out, EC.230 has an unpressurised basket and a commercial wand, EC.260 has a pressurised basket and a Panarello wand. It looks like most of the time what I need is the pressurised basket, and the wand question is interesting (ease vs geeking), though as I already have a rotary frither for speed, I probably want thje commercial wand for geeking. And I do want the unpressurused basket for ""experiment time"".

So: is it possible to get either an EC.30 plus a spare pressurised basket, or else (second preference) EC.260 plus a spare unpressurised basket? 

Alternatively: what is the cheapest decent machine, supporting ESE pods, with both baskets coming with it/available for it? And with, ideally, a commercial want, but any wand or even no wand will work in a pinch. It's really more about the espresso, as the milk can be processed elsewhere.

I am planning lattes, flat whites, and cappucinos (all of them mostky with alternative milks) and if doable, lungos (but I understand a cheap machine might exclude lungos). Americanos are not a priority as I like pourover better for ""black unconcentrated coffee"".

This 15.6-inch, 1080p FHD IPS portable monitor caught my attention mainly for how sleek and portable it is. The promise of a high-definition screen packed with features like USB-C connectivity and a built-in stand made it seem like a practical companion to my laptop. Unsurprisingly, it quickly proved itself to be versatile and well-suited for both work and casual use.

**Design and Build Quality That Speaks Simplicity**

The first thing that struck me about this portable monitor was how ridiculously lightweight it is. At just 1.5 pounds, it feels almost nonexistent in my backpack. Its thickness is about 0.7 inches, so it fits snugly into a laptop sleeve or any backpack pocket. The matte black casing has a professional look, which I appreciate since I often use it in client meetings. The built-in stand feels decently sturdy and is thoughtfully designed for both portrait and landscape orientation. It’s a bonus that it doubles as a screen protector, providing practical convenience.

What also stood out is the protective case. It does its job well by preventing scratches and lending durability, but I wonder if a more rugged option could have been included for those who travel extensively. Overall, the craftsmanship is high-quality but leans towards being minimalist and functional.

**Impressive Visuals in a Portable Package**

Visual performance is top-notch with this portable monitor. The full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS screen delivers vivid colors and sharp clarity, making it perfect for both productivity and streaming. I tested it with some spreadsheets and graphic design software, and the color reproduction was surprisingly accurate for a portable monitor. Movies and videos also looked great with no noticeable color distortion or ghosting. The anti-glare coating was a lifesaver during daytime work by the window.

That said, the 60Hz refresh rate is decent but not groundbreaking. It works perfectly fine for work, media consumption, and casual gaming, but dedicated gamers might crave a faster refresh rate for smoother gameplay. It’s worth mentioning that the screen lacks HDR support, which could have added some extra punch in visual intensity.

**Upsides**

- Ultra-lightweight and slim design
- Accurate and vibrant 1080p HD picture quality
- Protective case and built-in stand included
- Easy USB-C connectivity for data and power transfer
- Perfect fit for work, travel, or casual gaming setups

**Performance and Features That Make an Impact**

Performance is where the ViewSonic VA1655 comfortably holds its ground. The USB-C port is genuinely a game-changer, as it allows both data/video transmission and charging via a single cable. I’ve often powered this monitor directly from my laptop, which reduces the reliance on multiple power outlets—a blessing when you’re working remotely in tight spaces like coffee shops or airports. The inclusion of a mini HDMI port also comes in handy when connecting older devices.

It’s hard not to mention the built-in speakers. While they’re a nice addition and function reasonably well for casual needs, they lack the depth and volume that external speakers or headphones deliver. If you’re into immersive movie streaming or need sharp sound for presentations, you might want to rely on separate audio gear.

**Drawbacks**

- Built-in speakers deliver below-average audio quality
- Lack of HDR support limits dynamic range
- No additional rugged or heavy-duty case included

**Competing Brands**

In the crowded world of portable monitors, it’s clear that the ViewSonic VA1655 faces stiff competition. For instance, ASUS ZenScreen MB16AMT offers stylus support and a touchscreen feature, which could be an attractive option for graphic designers. However, it’s significantly pricier and heavier, which might turn off travelers. Another close competitor, the Lenovo ThinkVision M14, boasts sleeker aesthetics and excellent visual performance but skips out on built-in speakers altogether. In comparison, the VA1655 strikes a balance—it isn’t jam-packed with extras but delivers consistent performance at a more affordable price.

I would say this monitor carves its niche by offering versatility and simplicity aimed primarily at productivity enthusiasts and casual users who want something lightweight, functional, and approachable.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

The value proposition of this portable monitor compares well against its peers. You’re getting a full HD display, dual USB-C support, and a protective case all bundled into one compact package—features that tend to come separately elsewhere. While it doesn’t boast premium extras like HDR, touchscreen capabilities, or ultra-fast refresh rates, the design and feature set provide significant bang for the buck. If you’re looking for a practical and affordable solution to increase your screen real estate without sacrificing portability, this might be what you need.

Im hoping to start a mobile coffee cart for small events like bridal showers, birthdays etc (most likely 50 people max per event to begin with) 

Im looking for an espresso machine at around $2000 and also a good efficient grinder for around $500. 

Most likely would need a dual boiler machine, i really like the look of machines like the look of ACS minima, Profitec Pro, Rocket machines but im not sure how they can handle back to back espressos. 

I currently have the Ninja Luxe and use it for my own parties of about 30 people and it has done pretty well for that volume but not ideal for an actual event.

1n984fk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerCheck/comments/1n984fk/explore_if_the_best_laundry_detergent_pacs_by/,Explore if the Best Laundry Detergent Pacs by Persil Truly Deliver,"Giving Persil 2400776 laundry detergent pods a go felt like the ultimate test for my mountain of laundry every week. My family of five doesn’t go easy on clothes, so I needed a detergent that could handle messes from soccer practice, coffee spills, and the seemingly limitless capacity my toddler has to transform clean shirts into colorful disasters.

**User-Friendly Design for Hassle-Free Laundry Days**  
The moment I opened the tub of these detergent pacs, I noticed how compact and convenient they are. Each disc is a perfect little pod with four separate chambers, and this design had me intrigued from the start. Unlike liquid detergents, there’s no guessing how much to pour or risking gooey spills all over the lid. Tossing one of these into the drum before adding the clothes? Effortless. It’s like Persil designed these with people like me in mind—people who sprint through chores on autopilot.

[Ready to snag Persil 2400776? See Amazon’s price.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b07pmqq216/)

**Performance Like a Pro**  
My first load of laundry included a mixed bag—white t-shirts, muddy soccer shorts, and a tomato sauce-stained kitchen towel. Deep clean? Check. Colors looking vibrant? Absolutely. Persil pulls this off with a winning combination: stain removal, long-lasting freshness, fiber care, and overall deep cleaning bundled into one pod. The pasta sauce stain? Gone. Even the musty gym clothes didn’t stand a chance against this. 

For those who have high-efficiency (HE) appliances, there’s no compatibility drama here. These discs were champs in my HE washer. They dissolve entirely in cold and hot temperatures alike, leaving no annoying residue behind—a common gripe I’ve had with other similar products. My washer sometimes hates powder detergents, but these designed-to-dissolve pods? Zero problems.

**Positives**  
• Convenient and mess-free pre-measured pods  
• Works effectively in cold and hot water  
• Removes tough stains like grease and tomato sauce  
• Safe for all machine types, including HE washers  

**Caveats**  
• A minor downside was the moderately strong scent. While I appreciated the long-lasting freshness, my cousin (who’s sensitive to smells) found it slightly intense on her clothes.  
• The number of pods—just 16 per tub—might not last very long if you’ve got a big family or handle multiple loads daily.

**How It Holds Up Against Competing Products**  
Having tried other premium detergent brands like Tide Pods and Arm & Hammer Power Paks, I found Persil's design and performance a step above. In terms of stain removal, Persil excels over Arm & Hammer, which sometimes left greasy spots on lighter colors in my experience. Against Tide Pods, however, the competition is tighter. Tide offers similar cleaning efficiency, but Persil’s focus on fiber care and color longevity edges them slightly ahead for clothes that need to stand the test of wear and time.

One area where Persil could improve would be offering additional scent options or fragrance-free pods—something Arm & Hammer tends to do well. This would cater more to those with sensitivities.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
You’re paying for premium performance with these pods, and I'm not going to lie—they’re not the cheapest detergent option on the market. But considering each pac’s ability to tackle vast stains, odors, and overall cleaning in one go, I’d argue it gives excellent quality for the price. Plus, it saves time and hassle compared to pre-treating grimy clothes or running repeated cycles.

They were perfectly happy in the garden compost (???) with growth spurs this summer until I repotted them with proper houseplant airy mix three weeks ago from soil ninja. They sit on the same west-facing window sill (with a banana tree outside so it’s filtered and partially shaded).

Symptoms: 
There seems to be a few different issues present, as some have brown crispy edge and tips, some have brown spots in the middle, some have yellow halos and some don’t. There are also a couple of yellowing leaves with vein patterns that seem to indicate iron deficiency. It also seems to only affect the lower leaves for now. No growth observed since repotting. The yellow halo worries me the most because apparently it’s usually a sign of pest/fungal (correct me if I am wrong).

1n98147,https://www.reddit.com/r/PythonLearning/comments/1n98147/python_tutorial_bringing_python_concepts_to_life/,Python tutorial (Bringing Python Concepts to Life: A Business Logic Case Study),"Learning programming concepts in isolation can be challenging. I've had students complain that it is difficult bringing the concepts together to create a solution. Thus, I'm writing this tutorial to share here. The explanation is done via a shopping cart example.

# Variables: The Foundation of Our Data

Think of variables as named containers for storing data. 

* `customer_name = ""Alex""`: A string to hold text.
* `price_per_muffin = 2.50`: A float to store a number with decimals.
* `is_loyal_customer = True`: A boolean to represent a true or false state.

Using descriptive variable names makes our code easy to read and understand, which is a crucial habit to develop early on.

# Lists and Dictionaries: Organizing Complex Data

Once we have individual pieces of data, we need ways to organize them. This is where lists and dictionaries come in. 

# Lists: The Shopping Cart

A **list** is an ordered collection of items. It's easy to add or remove items.

>`order = [""muffin"", ""croissant"", ""coffee""]`

We can easily check if an item is in the cart or iterate over all the items to perform an action on each one.

# Dictionaries: The Menu with Prices

A **dictionary** is a collection of key-value pairs. For our bakery, a dictionary is ideal for storing the menu, associating each item's name (the key) with its price (the value).

>

This structure allows us to quickly find the price of any item by using its name, for example, \`menu\[""muffin""\]\` would give us \`2.50\`.

# Control Flow: Directing the Program's Logic

Control flow structures are what make a program dynamic. The two most common forms are \`if\` statements and \`for\` loops.

# `if` Statement: Making Decisions

>

# `for` Loop: Repeating Actions

>

# Putting it All Together: The Complete Checkout Logic

By combining these concepts, we can build a complete and functional system. The variables hold the data, the list and dictionary structure it, and the control flow guides the process of calculation and decision-making.

    # Variables to store customer information
    customer_name = ""Alex""
    is_loyal_customer = True
    
    # Dictionaries and lists to organize data
    menu = {
        ""muffin"": 2.50,
        ""croissant"": 3.00,
        ""coffee"": 4.50,
        ""cookie"": 2.00
    }
    
    order = [""muffin"", ""croissant"", ""coffee""]
    
    # Variables for calculation
    total_cost = 0.00
    discount_rate = 0.10
    
    print(f""--- Welcome, {customer_name}! ---"")
    print(""Your order includes:"")
    
    # Control Flow: Use a for loop to calculate the subtotal
    for item in order:
        if item in menu:
            price = menu[item]
            total_cost += price
            print(f""- {item.capitalize()}: ${price:.2f}"")
        else:
            print(f""- Sorry, '{item}' is not on our menu."")
    
    print(f""\nSubtotal: ${total_cost:.2f}"")
    
    # Control Flow: Use an if statement to apply a discount
    if is_loyal_customer:
        discount_amount = total_cost * discount_rate
        total_cost -= discount_amount
        print(f""Loyalty discount applied! (-${discount_amount:.2f})"")

Have you ever found yourself scrolling through social media or the endless web of articles, all while thinking, “I should really be doing something productive instead”? 🥴 Trust me, you’re not alone! We live in an era where time is money, and boy, do we need to stop wasting it! 

So, let’s dive into some **faceless growth strategies** that can genuinely help you *print money* before the AI overload catches us off guard. 🚀

### Here’s a quick rundown of what I’m talking about:

1. **Automate Like You Mean It**  
   Why are we still doing tasks manually in 2023?! Automation is our friend. Tools like Zapier or Integromat can save hours of your life. Imagine setting up a workflow that automatically sends emails or gathers data without you lifting a finger. 🙌

2. **Content is Still King (or Queen!)**  
   But wait—what if you don't want to show your face on camera? No problem! Think about:  
   - **Blogging**: Write about your passions or expertise.
   - **Podcasting**: Share your insights with just your voice (and maybe a cup of coffee!). ☕🎤
   - **AI-Generated Content**: Use *AI tools* to create articles, social media posts, and marketing materials in a snap. Honestly, you can find incredible resources [here](https://www.checkout-ds24.com/redir/540531/maximizeme/) that'll help maximize your output effortlessly.

3. **Leverage Affiliate Marketing**  
   Set it up once and watch it grow. Promote products you love without making it your full-time job. Just imagine: you share something you enjoy, and boom, cash flow happens while you sleep. 💰

4. **Utilize Social Media (Without Showing Your Face)**  
   Feeling camera-shy? No problem! Create an anonymous account, focus on visual content or curated memes/niche humor, and let the likes and shares roll in. Plus, TikTok doesn't always need a face, just a *hook* and value!

5. **Give Up Perfection**  
   Seriously, who has time for that? The ""perfect"" content is often the enemy of done. Don’t let overthinking keep you away from putting your work out there. If you get a little messy, it shows authenticity—and people love that!

Okay, real talk—it's time to shift gears. **What's holding you back?** Is it fear of failure, or maybe thinking your ideas aren't good enough? Here’s a wild thought: you don’t need to be perfect to get started. Your work will improve as you go. The important thing is to *start* now!

So let’s ditch that procrastination and make time our ally! ⏰ In this fast-paced digital landscape, those who adapt will thrive. And who doesn’t want to be part of that growth journey, right?

1n97yaw,https://i.redd.it/ltz8s4l84dnf1.png,My Criticisms of the 9.2.0 PTB,"I did post this to the BHVR forum that they ask, but I also chose to post it here for funny internet points. I depressingly had nothing else better to do with my day. Enjoy the essay:

The 9.2.0 PTB is interesting, to say the least. First thing's first, pretext: I play both killer and survivor somewhat competently. A friend bought me the game in November 2024, and at the current date (9/5/2025) I have racked up 855 hours of game time (according to Steam), 347 hours according to the DBD Stats page (28.9 on Survivor, 318.1 on Killer). I'm a Singularity main, with 38.9 hours played on him and a 63.46% kill rate. On Survivor, with Vittorio, my most-played character because I use the Geralt skin, I have a 32.86% escape rate. The game I was obsessed prior to Dead By Daylight was Call of Duty, which I had 1200 hours in, and I promptly left because I didn't like how Activision treated its player base.

I pride myself in my rationality and keeping my emotions as far from my opinions as much as possible. However, I am human, and therefore I am imperfect.

|——MACRO & MICRO——|

This patch is ridiculous. New players now have to worry about 39 new variables that didn't exist prior to the update. Dead by Daylight is a simple game where it's complexity is found in its simplicity. Survivors fix gens. Killers try to stop them. However, with 49 survivors (each with different breathing); 161 survivor perks; 139 killer perks; survivor and killer hitboxes; killer height differences; 41 killer powers, each with 20 addons; 21 realms with several maps inside them; the possibility of killer shack and/or main building spawning; who was hooked, who will be hooked; I have to stop myself early because even that is overwhelming for a 800 hour player with thousands of hours watching content creators make the game.

|——TUNNELING REDUCTION——|

The numbers are massive over-corrections. Survivors, who it is obvious whoever in charge of balancing is pandering to, are getting handheld patch after patch, this one is no exception. Survivors, who queued in to be chased, are complaining about being chased? And many times the chase doesn't last a minute. Of course their teammates are incompetent as well, so instead of taking advantage of their teammate getting tunneled, distracting the killer, they want to be altruistic and get flashlight saves instead of doing generators.

The 30 seconds of base-kit OTR is not terrible. I don't like it, but it isn't terrible. However, Killer Instinct not affecting just-unhooked survivors should not be a thing, as it directly and artificially nerfing Legion, who's entire power is mending and Killer Instinct. It also nerfs Ghost Face, as he technically wouldn't be able to see who revealed him.

""No collision with other players,"" sounds nice. The obvious intention by the devs here is to stop malicious survivors from bodyblocking. I applaud the devs here, because at least they thought about it. However, in my games and in games I've seen people play (Notably in QuietKills's video: [https://youtu.be/x3ei\_kL3-jA?t=195](https://youtu.be/x3ei_kL3-jA?t=195)) survivors have attempted and succeeded in pseudo-bodyblocking by getting inside the killer's hitbox and forcing the killer to hit the ""no-collision"" survivor because of DBD's spaghetti-coded auto-lock feature for basic attacks. So, a killer hits as soon as the game detects that it can hit a survivor, despite the said ""no collision.""

|——HOOK STATUS——|

I unironically like being able to see the hook status. I know it can be used to tunnel survivors out (as the game is pre-PTB), but I do enjoy it as it makes it a lot easier to plan out my moves ahead of time and distinguish multiple of the same survivor.

|——HOOKING BONUSES——|

The bonuses are amazing. Love them. Beautiful. Also W devs for admitting there is a disparity between Blight, Dracula, Ghoul, and Nurse's strength compared to killers like Wraith or Myers. Krasue fits as well, as she seems strong after playing around 5 or 7 matches with her, reliably getting 2K's. Basekit BBQ and mini-Furtive are a nice addition as well. I do wish that kicking a pallet doesn't get rid of it. But I can live with that in the metaphorical sense.

As a final note: these bonuses may apply to Nurse, but she might as well not have them.

|——TUNNELING AND SLUGGING——|

But the penalties are where things go downhill. Survivors, for the most part, don't like being slugged or tunneled, except for a few ""juicers."" I, with Geralt shit-talking the killer in my ear, have no problem being tunneled. I only have a problem with slugging someone until they bleed out (which, I admit, has happened). Killers tunneling is fine. Killers slugging requires some nuance. I'll cover my opinions on slugging and the slugging changes first:

Sometimes it is just worse for a killer to pick up. For example, a survivor got downed at shack pallet, and you hear a generator being repaired nearby or the tippity-tap of footsteps approaching rapidly, eager for a pallet/flashlight save. It is just smarter for the killer to leave them slugged. With that said, I do like the Resolve Bar in theory, as a killer and a downed survivor's teammates can do a lot in 90 seconds. I'm fine with basekit Tenacity, because having to choose between crawling under a pallet/away from a chase or recovering feels outdated to me. Even so, it should reset per hook stage because it is obvious the killer isn't slugging just to slug. Resolve should be to counter those few imbeciles who slug to bleed out the team. The game shouldn't be over until all Survivors are hooked.

Tunneling is a strategy that exists and persists throughout each and every killer, and is sometimes wholly necessary depending on the power (The Onryō's Condemn). Killers job, according to the Steam page and the Tutorial, is to stop survivors from escaping via any means possible. So who on Earth thought that, if a survivor dies at less than or equal to 5 hook states, the remaining survivors get 25% repair speed bonus as well as unblockable, undamageable, unregressable generators for the rest of the trial?

Math time. There are two teams: Survivor and Killer. Survivor is a team of 4, and Killer is solo. Each Survivor carries 25% of the weight of helping their team win. However, let's say the Killer sacrifices/moris one Survivor. The weight the dead Survivor carried is transferred to the rest of their team, so now there is a 33% chance for each Survivor to help their team win. To help them with that, just give the Survivors an 8% bonus to Repair, Healing, and Unlocking actions per Survivor killed. Even if someone is tunneled out first thing in the game, now the Killer is inconvenienced by the fact that Survivors finish gens faster. Leave regressing/blocking/damaging generators alone.

Realistically, if I were in the trials and one of my teammates just died, I think I'd be moving a bit faster to complete the generators. And also killers continue to get value of the perks they brought and bought with their hard-earned IRL money.

Finally, with the fact you can only kill on or after your sixth hook state, you can kill one person without tunneling anyone. You have 4 survivors: A, B, C, and D. The best way to get rid of one survivor without tunneling anyone is the sequence A, B, A, B/C/D, A. You should be fine if you kill a survivor on your 5th hook state. Anything before that? Ya you definitely tunneled a little bit. Back to back hook states shouldn't be penalized. Hooking shouldn't be discouraged.

Survivors survive.

Killers kill.

Neither's hand should be held to complete their objective.

|——LESS DEPRESSING STUFF——|

Myers is fun. I was worried about the Dash slop mechanic but I think the basekit tombstone makes up for that. Then you bring an ebony mori and they get obliterated anyway. Maybe one of the tombstones should allow Myers to kill survivors when they are at 1 hook so Survivors can continue to get value from the ""Locker tech,"" as that should always be a threat Myers has over the opponents, whether it be empty or not. Always love killers who can change dynamically, like Lich and Dracula.

I'm not an Unknown main, but Unknown was fun for the one time I played him. Got really lucky with some clones placed near vaults and blindsighted survivors often.

Haven't played Dracula yet. Don't really have opinions on this.

Thank you for reverting clown to require skill now. I know many survivors and Arinad are happy.

Played Ghoul with the classic Crash Out Kaneki build (Pain Res, Grim, DMS, Ruin, Mask & Coffee, Ebony Mori). Didn't feel any different. Asuno hasn't played the PTB yet as far as I know and I'm not enough of a Ghoul main to feel a difference.

Haven't played Oni yet, but I do like the change.

Survivor perk changes are fine. No real opinions on them.

Pain Res, Leverage, DMS shouldn't have been nerfed. Deerstalker rework is weird and I don't like it as Killers don't have a direct counter to the basekit Tenacity. Pain Res promotes hook spread, so if anything it should be buffed: Get all four stacks of Pain Res, then get one person out as quickly as possible.

Bots are still stupid and doesn't prioritize going for fast vaults.

1n97vbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Value_Gambling/comments/1n97vbl/interac_online_casino_canada_reddit_picks_2025/,Interac Online Casino Canada — Reddit Picks 2025,"Hey everyone. I’ve been gambling online in Canada for around five years now, and since so many folks keep asking about the best Interac online casino sites, I figured I’d share what I’ve learned as of 2025. When I first started, I used credit cards and random e‑wallets, but I soon switched to Interac e‑Transfer because it’s faster, safer, and much more convenient.
Back in the day, playing at land‑based casinos like Fallsview or Casino Montreal meant a long drive and waiting for a table. Over time, I realized that online casino interac platforms offer more convenience, more games, and better control over how I play. This post isn’t about hyping any particular site — just sharing what a Canadian gambler has figured out, especially around Interac deposits and withdrawals.

What Makes the Best Interac Casino Online

After testing dozens of Canadian online casinos that accept Interac e‑Transfer, I’ve noticed a few key things that separate the solid sites from the shady ones:
Fast Interac deposits and withdrawals. Deposits should land instantly (they usually do), and withdrawals shouldn’t take more than a few days. Interac withdrawals typically reach your bank in 1–3 business days after the casino’s internal review.

1) Trusted software providers. Look for games from Pragmatic Play, NetEnt, Microgaming, Play’n GO, etc.

2) Support that understands Canadian banking. Staff should be familiar with Interac e‑Transfer, not just generic payment methods.

3) Smooth mobile play. Slots and table games should work flawlessly on your phone.

4) Reasonable bonuses. Watch for wagering requirements that aren’t ridiculous.

The Reality of Online Gambling in Canada

Online gambling in Canada exists in a grey area. Most casino interac online platforms are licensed offshore (Malta, Curaçao, Kahnawake) but still accept Canadian players. The industry has matured in the last few years, and online casinos for real money have become more sophisticated. Many Canadians use Interac daily: it’s a domestic network established in 1984, and in 2022 Interac processed over a billion transactions in a single year, which speaks to how trusted it is.

However, major banks like RBC and TD sometimes block or reverse gambling-related transfers. In my experience, sticking to Interac e‑Transfer (rather than Interac Online) and using well‑known licensed casinos avoids most of the issues. You may encounter daily withdrawal limits around C$2,000 - C$3,000, so plan accordingly.

What Interac Online Casino Sites Actually Offer

The top Interac online casinos in 2025 typically provide:

1) Thousands of slot titles and casino games. Top sites offer 1,000–3,000 slots, with new releases weekly.

2) Real-money blackjack, roulette, and baccarat. Live dealers stream from studios, making the online experience feel like a brick‑and‑mortar venue.

3) Banking in Canadian dollars with Interac e‑Transfer. Deposits are often instant, and withdrawals can be processed via Interac e‑Transfer or other e‑wallets.

4) Mobile apps or responsive websites. You can play anywhere, whether you’re at home or on a coffee break.

How I Find a Reputable Online Casino in Canada

When I’m looking at new online casino interac e transfer sites, here’s my checklist:

1) Licensing. Curacao and Malta are common, but some players prefer Kahnawake or Ontario‑licensed sites.

2) Real player reviews. Reddit threads and forums give honest feedback on payout reliability and support.

3) CAD banking options. If the site doesn’t offer Interac or other CAD-friendly methods, it’s not worth my time.

4) Track record. How long has the casino served Canadian players? A new site might

5) Responsible gambling tools. Self-exclusion and deposit limits are must-haves for safe play.

Real Money Games Like Canadians Actually Play

The best Interac casinos aren’t just about flashy slots (though those are fun). Here’s what’s popular right now:

1) Online Slots. Most Interac casinos focus heavily on slots. Titles from Play’n GO (fun features, solid RTP), Pragmatic Play (big jackpots, loads of choices), Microgaming (classics), and NetEnt (polished graphics) dominate the lobbies. Top sites often have 2,000+ slot titles.

2) Table & Live Dealer Games. You’ll find live blackjack with Canadian-friendly dealers, multiple roulette variants (European, American, Lightning), baccarat for all bankrolls, and often poker or video poker rooms.

3) Specialty & Crash Games. Some sites feature crash or instant-win games for quick adrenaline hits.

Money Management at Interac Online Casinos

This part matters more than the games themselves:

1) Set deposit limits before you start. Interac makes it easy to send money, so set a budget and stick to it.

2) Stick to your bankroll. Don’t chase losses — it never ends well.

3) Use bonuses wisely. Some sites have reasonable wagering, while others trap you. Read the terms before claiming.

4) Think of it as entertainment. Online gambling should be fun; treat any win as a bonus, not a paycheck.

What Good Interac Casinos Do Right

The best online casino canada interac platforms stand out because they:

1) Offer support during Canadian hours. Getting help at 3 a.m. matters.

2) Are optimized for Canadian internet speeds. Smooth play even in rural areas is a plus.

3) Have CAD banking without hidden fees. No conversion to USD or EUR.

4) Provide mobile gameplay that doesn’t crash on Telus, Rogers, or Shaw networks.

Current State of Online Gambling in Canada

Canada’s gambling market is shifting. Physical casinos are still busy, but more people are going online. Offshore casinos remain accessible, and the best real‑money sites are adapting to Canadian players’ needs. As long as you stick with licensed platforms and use trusted payment methods like Interac, you’re in decent shape.

What Safe Interac Online Casinos Provide

The most reputable Interac casinos in 2025 always include:

1) Secure deposits and withdrawals in CAD. Transactions are encrypted and backed by bank-level security.

2) Transparent return-to-player (RTP) percentages. Many providers publish RTPs, so you know game fairness.

3) Responsible gambling tools. Self-exclusion, deposit limits, and reality checks help keep things under control.

4) Reasonable withdrawal times. Interac e‑Transfer withdrawals usually take 1–3 business days after approval, sometimes faster if auto-deposit is enabled.

Online Casino Experience vs Land-Based in Canada

These days, the online experience often matches or surpasses physical venues:

1) Better payout rates (RTPs). Online slots can offer higher RTPs than land-based machines.

2) No travel or parking costs. Play in your pajamas if you want.

3) 24/7 access. No need to wait for a seat at your favorite table.

4) Comfort and privacy. You control your environment and pace.

Finding Your Match

Not every online casino interac payment site is the same. Some excel at slots, others at live dealers or specialty games. Picking your best fit depends on:

1) Game preferences. Slots vs table games vs live dealers.

2) Bonus style. Some offer huge welcome bonuses; others reward loyalty.

3) Banking needs. Interac, credit card, crypto — choose what suits you.

4) Preferred device. Playing mainly on mobile? Make sure the interface works smoothly.

Final Thoughts on Real Money Interac Casinos

After years of playing, I’ve learned that the best Interac online casino isn’t always the flashiest. The platforms that stand out pay quickly, offer fair terms, and don’t mess players around.

Online casinos beat land-based options for convenience and variety. Start small, test withdrawals early, and see what fits your style. At the end of the day, gambling online in Canada should be fun. Set your limits, gamble responsibly, and enjoy yourself.

What about you? Have you found an Interac online casino that actually delivers? I’d love to hear how other Canadians are navigating the 2025 Interac casino landscape.

1n97tjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1n97tjm/mil_thinks_im_using_witchcraft_to_mind_control_my/,MIL thinks I'm using witchcraft to mind control my husband,"Yep. A few months ago, she called a welfare check for my husband and police came to our house. She saw an AI video that said 'your son is in danger' - he didn't reply to her text so she thought he was dead. I guess it turns out she fears that I'm going to hurt him because apparently, I am a part of some sort of witchcraft cult (I guess she can't decide whether I'm a witch or cult member). 

She FB messaged husband this weekend to see if he wanted to get coffee. He has not had a normal conversation with her for over two years (she was blocked for most of that time) - but this is how she is. She seems to forget why he's upset at her, and decides she is over it so he must be too and then acts like everything is normal. He told her no, but asked if there was anything wrong. She immediately got upset and accused him of being 'secretive.' They had some back and forth and finally he decided to write her a very long message detailing how he has been hurt by her over the years, how he feels like she doesn't actually care about him, she doesn't ask details about his life, etc. She replied that none of that is true, but she understands his perspective because he is 'under mind control, being manipulated, and taken advantage of' and that is altering his perception of the truth. He asked her who she meant and she said it's clear that our marriage is extremely toxic and that I am basically abusive. How would she know this, I have NO idea, because she hasn't been around DH or me for years and doesn't talk to either of us. But her reasoning is that I've kept him from having children (it was a decision we made together, he feels the same as me), I keep him locked up in a dark house (I guess because the one time she came to our house 7 years ago, we had candles/lamps on instead of the overhead light), and that I even keep him from having a job. He did quit his extremely toxic job several months ago and has been at home - we are preparing to move within the next few months so he's getting the house ready to sell. 

What is sooo funny to me is that she said to him that she's at a good place in life, and she can't be around people who aren't 'moving forward in their lives like she is' - so she can't be around DH. Who the fuck says that to their child? And if she was actually convinced I was abusive then why wouldn't she be trying her best to help DH get out of a bad/toxic situation instead of, you know, abandoning him because he's not on her level?

She sent him a final text saying she 'spoke with someone' (I'm guessing his sister) who confirmed that he was still struggling with past things in his childhood in regards to his mom. Basically he needs to get over it all, she was able to and she had such a bad childhood. No apology for anything. He blocked her again and is done.

Her facebook is full of weird AI videos (she scares me so I have an account just to check up on her). Most of them are titled like ""CHOSEN ONE, your family member is on a MISSION to destroy you and they are getting arrested tomorrow!"" or ""GOD is going to take this person away so they can't hurt you"", ""Your SON/SISTER/etc has been EXPOSED by GOD and you won't believe what they're doing!"" She also posts a lot of these about witchcraft/demonic forces - she believes her whole family is in this cult conspiring against her and I am part of it too. She posts these videos with captions sometimes (talking about a woman) and although she doesn't say my name, I 100% know they are directed towards me. When we randomly saw her out, she asked my DH if I was in the cult and she also told police (at our house) she felt I was dangerous. 

So yeah. Putting 2 + 2 together, I am able to brainwash dear hubby into doing everything I want because I'm a witch. I told DH I wish I was capable of such power lol. ",38,1757084910.0,JUSTNOMIL,12,0.98,False

1n97r18,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1n97r18/explore_the_turelar_immersion_blender_8808hb02/,Explore the Turelar Immersion Blender 8808-HB02 Review Could This Be Your Kitchen Hero?,"Testing out the turelar 8808-HB02 Immersion Blender was an adventure I didn’t know my kitchen needed. Right out of the box, I could see this wasn’t just another run-of-the-mill hand blender. With its sleek silver finish and ergonomic grip, it looked like a tool that could handle everything from silky soups to chunky salsas. As someone who constantly experiments with recipes, I was ready to see if this product could keep up with my daily culinary chaos.

**Thoughtful Design and Functionality**

The first thing that caught my attention was its sturdy build paired with surprisingly light handling. The 1100W motor is a beast, and it doesn’t mess around. Whether tackling boiling-hot soup for dinner or whipping up a frothy matcha latte during my morning rush, the blender was up for the task. Having the trigger variable speed control was new for me; adjusting the speed mid-blend was oddly satisfying and way less messy compared to the traditional fixed-speed settings of other blenders I’ve tested. 

[Check turelar 8808-HB02 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0cplvlfk2/)

Another notable design feature is the nylon blade guard. It’s not just for show—it genuinely prevents scratching my pots, making my cast iron cookware happy and leaving me with fewer worries about damage. Cleaning it was much simpler than I expected, thanks to detachable components that require just a quick rinse or gentle wash in warm water. Given the convenience, I didn't feel overwhelmed adding it to my daily cooking routine.

**Versatility at Its Core**

This immersion blender comes with a five-in-one bundle of attachments, making it a one-stop solution for everything blending and chopping. There's a food processor attachment, milk frother, whisk, and more—each with a purpose. I tested the food processor attachment first, and chopping veggies for salsa never felt so easy; even garlic cloves didn’t stand a chance. The whisk attachment is great for whipping cream, though I admit it took me a moment to figure out the best speed setting to avoid over-whipping. The milk frother, however, felt like an unexpected bonus. As a coffee enthusiast, being able to whip up café-style lattes at home was a game-changer.

**Upsides**

- Powerful 1100W motor effortlessly tackles tough blending jobs.  
- BPA-free components ensure safety for food prep, especially for baby food.  
- Adjustable speed via the trigger design gives precise control and reduces splattering.  
- Compact size and lightweight design are perfect for quick use and easy storage.  

**Adverse Aspects**

- The corded design limits movement, especially in a crowded or busy kitchen.  
- The motor can get overly heated if used for extended periods with harder ingredients like ice or frozen fruits.  
- Switching between attachments takes some getting used to.  

**Performance Under Pressure**

During a cooking marathon last weekend, I pushed the blender to its limits. I tried blending a chunky tomato-based soup directly in the pot. It powered through with ease, leaving no lumps in sight—a true lifesaver for someone as impatient as me. The only catch was figuring out how long to keep the motor running without overheating. After blending for several minutes non-stop, I noticed it did get warm, so I had to take short breaks.

Safety-wise, the blending arms feel sturdy when locked into place, and there's no fear of them detaching unexpectedly. Knowing it's UL-approved adds an extra layer of assurance. And for anyone wondering, yes, I tested its ability to crush ice—though, as directed, I kept it to a minimum to avoid pushing the motor too hard.

**Competing Products**

One product comparison that came to mind was the KitchenAid Corded Hand Blender. While it’s known for its durability and blending performance, it doesn’t come packed with as many accessories as this turelar version. Plus, the adjustable speed on this model sets it apart, offering finer control over recipes. On the other hand, I’d say the Braun MultiQuick Hand Blender performs quieter, but it’s more expensive and frankly less ergonomic due to its bulkier design. Both models have their perks; however, for a balance between versatility and power, this immersion blender holds its ground nicely.

**Smart Spending**

Considering the array of attachments and its high-performance motor, this immersion blender justifies its mid-range price bracket. You’re not just purchasing a single-use gadget; you’re essentially investing in a multi-purpose kitchen helper. Although some higher-end brands might boast quieter motors or cordless features, the trading-off here is negligible when factoring in the value of additional tools. Simply put, it’s worth every penny for anyone who enjoys experimenting in the kitchen or needs an all-in-one solution for blending, chopping, or whisking.

1n97q1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1n97q1s/a_little_kindness_a_day_never_hurts/,A little kindness a day never hurts,"Just a random thought I had while scrolling through the Need Advice flair today, is that it never hurts to take a few minutes out of each day to be kind to someone else. 

I saw that plenty of posts are posted by people who have no one else to talk to, and it saddened me to think of how suffocating it must be. Whether you’re just scrolling out of boredom or looking for answers, always remember that everyone has battles and they’re reaching out silently for help.

You could be that very one post that triggered them to seek help, or perhaps you might be that very few people who have been nice to them. Whether it’s Reddit or in real life, spreading kindness to people will always make you feel a little better. You might not think much of your words, but it will always be on someone’s mind. 

Tell the barista who didn’t spill your coffee on purpose that it’s alright, forgive your kids’ mistakes if they’re aware it’s wrong, lend your friends a listening ear even if you don’t have advice for them, and console a random stranger who’s crying after being rejected from their dream job. 

Don’t be afraid to be kind, because one day you’ll appreciate someone doing the same for you. And never take someone’s kindness for granted, because more than likely these people have been through so much themselves.

1n97ofg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1n97ofg/does_this_elite_gourmet_5cup_coffee_maker_truly/,Does This Elite Gourmet 5-Cup Coffee Maker Truly Deliver? In-Depth Review,"The Elite Gourmet EHC-5055 Automatic 5-Cup Brew & Drip Coffee Maker is one of those appliances you immediately appreciate after a groggy morning. I’ve been putting this sleek little brew buddy to the test daily, and while it has its strong points, there are a few quirks that deserve attention. As someone who enjoys grinding fresh coffee beans and taking a sip before the world fully awakens, I found this compact coffee machine to be an interesting blend of convenience and simplicity. Let’s break down the experience with this machine and see if it’s worth a spot on your counter.

**Compact Design That Fits Anywhere**

Living in a small apartment means every counter inch matters. The product's dimensions—6.61""D x 7.87""W x 9.25""H—are exactly what makes it a dream for tight kitchen corners or even office kitchenettes. Its matte black finish adds a touch of elegance, easily blending with my other appliances. The semi-transparent water reservoir with its water level indicator is a practical addition; I never have to guess if there's enough water. However, despite its compact build, the plastic materials left me wondering about its long-term durability. While functional, the overall build doesn’t scream high-end.

**Powerful Yet Simple Functionality**

This drip coffee maker is a no-brainer for people who hate overly complicated coffee machines. The simple on/off switch paired with a power indicator light feels refreshingly straightforward, and personally, I appreciated not having to fumble with countless buttons at 6 a.m. The reusable filter is another thoughtful touch, especially for eco-conscious users and those of us trying to cut down on disposable coffee filters. I do wonder, though, how long the included filter will last, given its lightweight feel. 

**Pause and Serve: A Midnight Savior**

One feature that stood out to me (and trust me, it mattered during one rushed morning!) was the “Pause ‘N Serve” function. Imagine brewing coffee for guests and sneaking a cup before the entire carafe fills up—this small touch adds a level of convenience. It’s not flawless; I noticed a small drip after removing the carafe mid-brew, but nothing a quick wipe didn’t fix. 

[Check Elite Gourmet EHC-5055 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07hyzzbzj/)

**Performance and Coffee Experience**

The coffee flavor using this machine depends heavily on the type of grounds you choose. I’ve tried various grinds, and it performed best with medium ground coffee. The 5-cup glass carafe size means it’s perfect for solo drinkers or those whose caffeine needs aren’t extreme. The brewing time is quick, clocking in at around 5 minutes, but here’s something to note: The brewing does emit a faint noise, which may be noticeable if you’re particularly sound-sensitive in the morning.

**Advantages**

- Small footprint, ideal for apartments, dorm rooms, and office spaces.  
- Reusable filter helps reduce waste and saves money on disposable filters.  
- Straightforward operation works well for people who dislike complicated devices.  

**Drawbacks**

- Limited capacity; not great for families or heavy coffee drinkers.  
- Plastic components feel less durable and may wear out quicker with heavy usage.  

**Market Rivals**

Comparing this coffee maker to others in a similar price range, the Black+Decker 5-Cup Coffeemaker and Mr. Coffee Mini Brew both came to mind. The Black+Decker option has slightly more robust materials and a sturdier glass carafe, but it lacks the convivence of a reusable filter, which means recurring costs for paper filters. Mr. Coffee provides similar simplicity but doesn’t include ""Pause 'N Serve"" functionality, which gave the Elite Gourmet model a noticeable edge for my on-the-go lifestyle. 

However, the Mr. Coffee mini brewer did seem a bit quieter, which might appeal to audiophiles seeking to avoid brewing noise. Elite Gourmet’s strong points rest on its reusable filter and Pause feature, but it faces tough competition because its materials feel a bit lighter in comparison.

**Cost Efficiency**

This coffee machine lands in the budget-friendly category, making it an appealing choice for students, office workers, or anyone not looking to break the bank for a caffeine fix. Given the built-in eco-friendly reusable filter and no unnecessary features, I'd call its balance between price and practicality a decent value proposition. If you’re a light coffee drinker or a casual user needing only a few cups a day, it justifies its cost. However, if you’re someone who relies on a more durable machine with a robust build for everyday heavy use, it might be worth exploring higher-end options.

1n97mtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TraumaCarewithSaras/comments/1n97mtg/beyond_the_voices_the_invisible_torment_of/,Beyond the Voices: The Invisible Torment of Sensory Overload in Schizophrenia,"When we talk about schizophrenia, the conversation almost always centers on its most famous features: hallucinations and delusions. But there’s a hidden, pervasive layer to the experience that is often overlooked, even though it can be just as debilitating: a profound and chaotic disruption of the senses.



This isn't about hearing voices. This is about the brain losing its ability to filter the world. It's about the crushing weight of a humming fluorescent light, the unbearable scratch of a clothing tag, and the overwhelming flood of a crowded street. This is the reality of sensory overload.



**The Broken Filter Theory**

Think of your brain as a brilliant receptionist. Its job is to take in millions of sensory inputs every second—sights, sounds, smells, textures, and filter out the irrelevant ones. This allows you to focus on a conversation in a noisy room and ignore the feeling of your socks on your feet.



For many people with schizophrenia, this neural receptionist is overwhelmed. The filter is broken. There is no hierarchy of importance; everything comes rushing in with the same screaming intensity.



A ticking clock isn't background noise; it’s a pounding, rhythmic assault that drowns out all other thought.

The pattern on a carpet doesn't just sit on the floor; it moves, swirls, and demands visual attention, making it impossible to walk across it.

The texture of food can become so repulsively vivid that eating is a nightmare.

Multiple people talking doesn't sound like a conversation; it’s a jarring, incomprehensible cacophony where every syllable clashes.

This isn't a choice or a sensitivity. It’s a fundamental breakdown in sensory processing that fuels anxiety, paranoia, and withdrawal.



**How Overload Fuels the Fire**



Sensory overload isn't just an isolated symptom; it actively exacerbates the more well-known aspects of the disorder.



**Paranoia**: When your brain is receiving a chaotic jumble of unfiltered data, it desperately tries to make sense of it. This often leads to apophenia, the tendency to perceive meaningful connections between unrelated things. The hum of the air conditioner isn't random; it must be a hidden camera. The laughter from another table isn't about a private joke; it's directed at you. The overload creates the raw, chaotic data that paranoia organizes into a threatening narrative.

Social Withdrawal: Imagine trying to have a coffee with a friend while feeling like you’re standing in the middle of a heavy metal concert, a strobe-lit dance club, and a room full of people sandpapering wooden blocks. It’s physically painful and mentally exhausting. Is it any wonder that people retreat from social situations? Withdrawal isn’t always a lack of desire for connection; it’s often a necessary act of self-preservation.



**Cognitive Overwhelm**: The brain’s resources are finite. When 90% of its processing power is being used to manage the sensory chaos of a buzzing lightbulb and the rustling of papers, there is little left for focus, memory, or executive function. This explains the ""brain fog"" and cognitive deficits that are so common.

Beyond Medication: Managing the Sensory Storm

Treatment often focuses on antipsychotics, which primarily target psychosis. But what helps with this sensory flooding?



**Sensory Modulation**: This is a therapeutic approach that involves learning to use one type of sensory input to calm another. It’s highly individual.



Weighted blankets can provide deep pressure touch, which has a calming effect on the nervous system.

Noise-canceling headphones in public can reduce auditory input to a manageable level.

Fidget toys or a smooth worry stone can provide a grounding tactile focus.

Sunglasses or hats can soften overwhelming visual stimuli and bright lights.

Environmental Control: Creating a safe, sensory-friendly space at home is crucial. This means soft lighting, minimal clutter, quiet spaces, and comfortable, soft-textured clothing.

Advocacy and Understanding: The most powerful tool is awareness. For loved ones and colleagues, understanding that a person’s need for quiet or solitude isn’t rejection, it’s a coping mechanism. Simple asks like ""Could we turn the TV down?"" or ""I need a few minutes alone"" should be met with support, not skepticism.



**A Call for a Broader Understanding**



To truly support those with schizophrenia, we must expand our understanding of their experience beyond the dramatic and into the daily grind of sensory existence. Recognizing sensory overload is key to unlocking empathy.



It helps us see that a person isolating themselves isn’t being antisocial; they are recovering from a world that physically hurts. It helps us understand that frustration or distraction might not be a personality trait, but a response to an overwhelming environment.



By talking about the broken filter, we unmask a hidden layer of the disorder. We move closer to seeing the whole person, and in doing so, we can build a world that’s not just aware of schizophrenia, but is truly accommodating to the people who live with it.

I went down that rabbit hole this year, trying five different services (sometimes on three devices at once—my router deserves a medal). Here’s what I found out, in the spirit of saving you some trial-and-error with your next **iptv subscription 2025**.

# 1. [IPTVMEZZY](https://iptvmeezzy.com/)

* **Price:** $16/month (multi-month plans bring it down a bit)
* **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (US, UK, CA, FR coverage is deep)
* **Smoothness:** 9/10 (even during weekend Premier League matches and US news hours)
* **My notes:** I actually came across this one via a random **iptv reseller** post in a UK Facebook group. The thing that stood out was just how reliable it was across regions—British comedy, Canadian news, French movies, you name it. Only saw minor buffering once during a storm, but otherwise it just works, which is all I really want.

# 2. [XXIPTV](https://xxiptv.top/)

* **Price:** $15/month
* **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (lots of US and UK sports, solid CA/FR selection)
* **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (occasional hiccups during big US sports, but VOD is snappy)
* **My notes:** XXIPTV has a polished interface and their **best iptv trial** is actually useful—no credit card, just email. Their US and UK sports channels are a strong point, and there’s a surprising amount of French VOD (even some indie stuff). Lost a few local CA channels for a day, but support was quick to respond.

# 3. [Aurorastreaming](http://aurorastreaming.online/)

* **Price:** $14/month
* **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (well-balanced between UK, FR, US, CA)
* **Smoothness:** 8/10 (news and movies are smooth, big events sometimes lag)
* **My notes:** I found Aurorastreaming after someone in a FR tech group recommended it for French TV. The regional content is solid, especially if you switch between English and French channels. Had to refresh a few times during a major UK rugby game, but otherwise a pleasant surprise.

# 4. UrbanVision IPTV

* **Price:** $13/month
* **Channels:** 27,000+ live, 80,000+ VOD (good for North America, fewer FR/UK niche channels)
* **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (some buffering during CA hockey nights, but fine for movies)
* **My notes:** UrbanVision feels like the “safe” choice—nothing fancy, but it works. The US and CA lineup is solid, though some UK special interest channels were missing. Setup was quick, and their **iptv subscription 2025** page is straightforward.

# 5. BlueStream Edge

* **Price:** $12/month
* **Channels:** 19,000+ live, 55,000+ VOD (mostly US/UK, limited CA/FR)
* **Smoothness:** 7/10 (evening hours see more buffering, especially UK or US sports)
* **My notes:** BlueStream Edge is the budget option. It’s fine for background TV or catching up on old sitcoms. The VOD library is decent for older US/UK shows, but don’t expect all the latest releases. Their **iptv reseller** section is actually easy to navigate if you’re curious about that side of things.

# My IPTV Takeaways in 2025

* Always try the [**best iptv trial**](https://xxiptv.top/)—it’s the fastest way to see if a service actually fits your habits and region.
* Don’t let big channel numbers sway you; focus on the stuff you really want to watch (for me, that’s a weird mix of UK panel shows and French thrillers).
* Even the [**top rated iptv**](https://www.reddit.com/r/UKTVSUB/wiki/index/) services have the odd bad night, especially during major live events.
* If you’re thinking about becoming an **iptv reseller**, just know you’ll be tech support for your whole extended family.
* Most importantly, always use a VPN. It’s just smart.",1,1757084438.0,SheinSharingLinks,0,1.0,False

Share Your Best Budget Hacks (PH Edition),"Ever checked your wallet and saw only coins + jeepney fare left? College life in the Philippines = survival mode most of the time. (real talk👌) But with some smart budgeting tricks, you can stretch that allowance. Here are some tried-and-tested hacks:

**1. Track Every Peso**  
GCash transactions, notebooks, even a sticky note—just know where your money goes. Awareness is tipid power.  

**2. Cook or Prep Meals**  
Karinderya is okay, but eating out every day = ubos agad. Meal prep for 2–3 days and save for those rare milk tea splurges.  

**3. Student Discounts FTW**  
Always flash your ID—MRT/LRT, coffee shops, even cinema sometimes. Small savings add up.  

**4. Delay Impulse Buys**  
“Shopee check out?” Wait 24 hours. Most of the time, you’ll realize you don’t really need it.  

**5. Borrow or Go Second-Hand**  
Textbooks? Photocopy. Gadgets? Marketplace. Uniforms? Ukay-ukay. No shame in saving.  

**6. Side Hustles = Extra Baon**  
Tutoring, Canva gigs, Shopee live selling—konting raket can cover your merienda fund.  

**7. Use the 50/30/20 Rule (Student Version)**  
- **50% Needs:** tuition, fare, food  
- **30% Wants:** milk tea, Netflix, snacks  
- **20% Savings/Debt:** build an emergency fund or pay off utang sa tropa

1n97kn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1n97kn1/looking_to_buy_my_first_espresso_machine_500900/,Looking to buy my first espresso machine [500€-900€],"Hi! Nice to meet you all!

I’m completely new to portafilter machines and looking to buy my first one.

I’ve been using a Jura E8 for a long time because of the convenience but it broke down recently and I’m taking this as an opportunity to get into portafilter machines.

Location: Germany

Preferred drink types: I usually drink mostly espresso, sometimes a cappuccino. I’d like to be able to offer black coffee and milk drinks to guests though and I don’t want to get a separate kettle, so a hot water dispensing mechanism and a good steam wand would be greatly appreciated.

Drink frequency: On my own I drink 2-3 cups per day. Of course, when guests are over, there’ll be a higher demand but I don’t mind standing at the coffee machine for a few minutes and chat while pulling shots.

Space: My kitchen is somewhat small so it’d be amazing if I could limit the setup width to ±60cm (including machine, grinder, tamping “station”) though I could theoretically store the tamping equipment and coffee beans somewhere else and have the full ±60cm for only machine and grinder.

Experience and budget: I’m brand-new but I’m looking for an upgrade from my old Jura E8, so I’m willing to spend at max somewhere around 1200€ (though preferably less) for the complete setup and between 500€ and 900€ for the machine. If there’s an \*amazing\* machine that outclasses everything below at 950€ then I‘d be open to considering that as well. But I do not want to go over 1000€ for a first-time machine.

Manual or electric: Only electric.

Candidates: I’ve been looking at the Sage Bambino Plus and the Rancilio Silvia so far but I’m completely open to any suggestions. The only reason the Sage is still on the list is because it just looks much better than the Silvia imho and because the Silvia takes some time to heat up. A big minus for it to me is that unlike the Silvia, the Bambino isn’t upgradeable if I decide I want even better coffee in the future, so I’m currently leaning towards the Silvia.  
I’ve been keeping the machines I looked at in the lower end of my budget in case I find out I’m not that much into the whole portafilter business but I’m also open to exploring a little higher priced machines from 850€ upwards if they’d give me a much better quality and experience than a Silvia with the Gaggimate Pro upgrade. I’d appreciate it if the portafilter were of a standard size so I can continue to use any equipment I buy like tamper, filters, new portafilters, etc. with a possible future machine.

If I have to wait a long time for the machine to heat up, that’s a dealbreaker. I’d prefer it if it were ready when I’m done with grinding and preparing the coffee though if absolutely necessary to get a grandiose machine that takes maybe 5-7 minutes to heat up, I’m willing to go to the bathroom in the meantime.  
But I don’t want to have my coffee \*after\* I’ve had breakfast in the morning.  
I could maybe get behind installing a timed switch that turns the machine on a few minutes before my alarm goes off if the heating up isn’t too loud and there‘s an amazing machine that takes longer but that‘d definitely be a minus point.

For the grinder, I’ve been looking at the DF54. If I end up nearer to 500€ than 900€ with the machine, I’d probably consider the DF64 II, as I’ve read that the grinder is probably the most important part of the setup.

Same for coffee, does it start at a higher amount for the lowest setting, like 9 grams or so and then up to 16 grams for the strongest?",1,1757084334.0,superautomatic,3,1.0,False

**2024-02-17 Saturday [Evening 03:45 PM]**

**(Normal POV)**

The evening air was soft and golden, making everything look gentler than it truly was. Birds drifted lazily across the sky, their wings catching the fading sun. The streets were calmer than they had been that morning; no rush, no heavy noise, just the scattered sound of footsteps and distant chatter.

Armin and the others walked together, filling the street with energy. Reiner led the way with a broad grin, holding himself with the pride of someone who had a plan. After all, today was his birthday, and the little party at the mall was his idea. His voice carried as he teased Connie, while Connie shot back with clumsy jokes that made Bertholdt chuckle under his breath. Annie, as usual, tried to look unimpressed, but even she couldn’t hide the small smile at the corners of her lips as Armin quietly reached for her hand.

The group moved like a river of laughter and small joys, but not everyone was caught in its flow.

At the very back, a few steps behind, Mikasa walked in silence. Her eyes weren’t on the sunset or the friends around her. They kept slipping sideways to Eren.

He walked with them but apart, hands tucked into his pockets, his gaze fixed somewhere ahead, his face unreadable. Mikasa told herself not to look, but her eyes betrayed her every time. Three days without seeing him, three days of unanswered questions, and now he was suddenly here.

Her chest tightened. Could she say it today? Could she finally confess what weighed on her heart? Or would the chance slip away again, like it always did?

For now, she stayed quiet, each step matching the group’s pace, but her mind was nowhere near their laughter. It was with him. Always him.


**(Mikasa’s POV)**

The evening sky glowed soft orange, fading into blue as a gentle wind brushed against my cheeks. Laughter filled the air around me. Connie cracked ridiculous jokes, Sasha nearly choked from laughing too hard, and Reiner leading the way with his big voice. Still, their voices felt distant.

My thoughts were on him.

Eren walked a few steps ahead with the others. To them, he blended in like any other friend, but to me, he felt like a puzzle I couldn't solve. It had been three days since I last saw him. Though he claimed he was *""sick,""* I didn’t buy it. He was hiding something. I could feel it.

But seeing him now—his hair shifting slightly in the breeze, his shoulders relaxed as he listened to Armin—I couldn’t look away. I caught myself stealing glances at him from the corner of my eye, again and again.

Maybe I could tell him today.

I had already shared the truth with Mr. Unknown. That should help, right? Maybe that was the first step toward finding courage. But I needed the right moment, a chance to pull him aside. Surrounded by laughter, that moment felt impossibly far away.

**“Armin! Annie!”** Connie’s voice broke through my thoughts. **“Can you two stop holding hands for five minutes? We’re supposed to be a group, not on your honeymoon!”**

Everyone burst into laughter. Armin rolled his eyes, his cheeks pink. **“Jealous much, Connie? Don’t worry—you’ll find someone who can put up with you one day.”**

The teasing continued, but eventually, Armin moved closer to Eren, while Annie drifted back toward me. Her sharp eyes studied me for a moment. I tried to look away, but she wouldn’t let me escape.

**“Mikasa,”** Annie said softly so the others wouldn’t hear. **“Don’t lie to me. I’ve known you long enough. Something’s wrong. You’re… carrying something.”**

Her words felt heavy against my chest. I opened my mouth, but nothing came out.

Then Sasha chimed in cheerfully yet concerned. **“She’s right. You’ve been weird lately. You barely laugh at Connie’s jokes—and they’re the best part of hanging out!”**

**“I’ve been the same as always,”** I muttered, forcing a small shrug. My heartbeat thundered now.

**“Come on,”** Annie pressed, her tone sharper. **“Stop pretending. You can trust us.”**

Their eyes were on me, waiting. I clenched my fists at my sides, searching for words. But if I told them—even a little—it would all fall apart. Eren would know before I was ready.

So I forced myself to breathe and shook my head. **“I’m fine. Really. Don’t make something out of nothing.”** My voice was firmer this time, leaving no room for more questions. **“Let’s just talk about something else.”**

Annie narrowed her eyes like she didn’t believe me, but she didn’t push further. Sasha exchanged a glance with her, then sighed, muttering something about *“stubborn Mikasa.”*

The group’s laughter returned, light and carefree, but inside me, the silence of my secret grew louder.

**(Few minutes later)**

The glass doors of the mall slid open with a soft hiss, releasing a rush of cool air that carried the faint scents of coffee, fried food, and new clothes. Inside, the mall buzzed with life. Children pulled at their parents, groups of friends laughed loudly, and couples leaned in close to share secrets. Bright lights shimmered on polished floors, reflecting the constant movement of people.

Reiner stood in front of us, grinning proudly like a tour guide.  
**“Alright, everyone. Do whatever you want for now. Just meet at the Game Centre on the second floor by five. Don’t be late.”**  

**“Got it!”** Connie said, already dragging Sasha toward the food court.  
Armin and Annie slipped away quietly, hand in hand, lost in their own world. Even Reiner and Bertholdt disappeared, wearing that look that told me they were up to something.

Then there was Eren.  
He walked alone, hands in his pockets, moving steadily and unbothered. The crowd swirled around him, but he seemed detached from it all. My chest tightened at the sight. Maybe this was the chance I had been waiting for. 

I hesitated only for a moment before following him.  

He stopped in a clothing store, casually flipping through shirts on a rack. His face was unreadable—calm and distant. I bit my lip, forcing myself to speak.  
**“Hey, Eren,”** I said, trying to keep my voice steady. **“Good to see you.”**

He turned his head, and our eyes met for a brief moment.  
**“Oh. Mikasa.”** His tone was flat, but not unkind. **“Yeah. Nice to see you too.”**

I swallowed, searching for the right words.  
**“It’s been a while. I didn’t see you the last few days.”** 

**“Mm.”** He continued to focus on the shirts. **“I was sick.”**  

It felt too neat and easy. I knew better than to take that at face value, but I only nodded, pretending to accept it. A silence stretched between us, heavy enough to make me restless. I tried again.  
**“Feels like Reiner planned something special, doesn’t it?”** 

That finally made him look at me.  
**“He told me it’s his birthday.”**

I froze. His birthday? My stomach dropped—how could I forget? Heat rushed to my face, and I forced a quick nod to cover my mistake.  
**“Yeah… I know.”**  

I didn’t know.  

The silence returned, even heavier this time. My chest pounded, and my throat tightened. This might be my only chance. If I didn’t say it now, I might never find the courage again.  
**“Eren…”** I started, my voice softer than I intended. **“Can I talk to you about something important?”**  

His eyes flickered, looking less guarded now. **“Sure. What is it?”**  

I hesitated, every word battling against the lump in my throat. **“It’s about… your parents. Their accident.”**  

For the first time, I saw his expression falter. His jaw tightened, and his gaze sharpened on me. Then he said it—calmly, but it cut straight through me.  
**“I know, Mikasa. I know it was your parents’ car that caused it.”**  

The world seemed to tilt. My breath caught. He knows.  

**“How—how do you know that?”** I asked, my voice shaking.  

**“Someone told me.”**  

My mind raced. It must be him, Mr. Unknown. He’s the only one who knew. Which means… Eren has a connection to him.  

**“Who told you?”** I pressed, though I already had a hunch.  

His gaze softened slightly, but his tone remained firm. **“I promised him I wouldn’t say.”**  

I lowered my eyes. Of course he wouldn’t. My hands curled at my sides, and the words spilled out before I could stop them.  
**“Eren… will you forgive me?”** My voice broke. Tears stung my eyes, but I forced them down.  

He didn’t look surprised. His answer was quick, almost gentle.  
**“Forgive you? For what? You didn’t do anything wrong. It wasn’t your fault. The past is the past, Mikasa. You need to let it go.”**  

His words washed over me—soft and steady—and something inside me broke. My chest ached, but at the same time, it felt lighter. I blinked quickly to push away the tears and managed a small, shaky smile.  
**“Thank you, Eren.”**  

**“You’re welcome.”** He gave me a faint nod, then glanced back at the shelves. **“Come on. Let’s look around. Shopping is more fun with someone else, right?”**  

I stared at him, surprised by the invitation, before I finally nodded. **“Yeah… okay.”**  

We wandered through the shop together. My hands brushed the fabrics, but my mind was elsewhere. Every step beside him made my heart race, like it was trying to tell me something I wasn’t ready to admit.  

Then, without a word, he picked up a scarf—a deep red one, soft and warm. He turned to me and gently draped it around my neck. His fingers brushed my skin as he adjusted it, and my breath hitched.  
**“There,”** he said softly. **“It suits you.”**  

The scarf felt warm, but it couldn’t match the heat rushing through my chest. I lifted my eyes to his. His green eyes met mine—steady and calm, yet filled with something I couldn’t name.  

I smiled at him, unable to hold it back. He smiled back.  

In that moment, I made a decision in my heart.

We've all been there: you take that first eager sip and…yep. That's lava. Ten minutes later, it's already verging on lukewarm disappointment. Not exactly the burst of joy you were hoping for.  
  
**Here's the deal:** the sweet spot for tasting what coffee really has to offer is between 135°F (57°C) and 145°F (63°C). Within that range, you actually taste those fancy notes like ""berry,"" ""nuts,"" or ""chocolate""…not just ""hot"" or ""not hot.""  
  
**Here's why:** your taste buds wake up around this range. Too hot, and your mouth basically goes numb to protect itself—so all you perceive is heat. Too cool, and those delicate aromatic compounds that create flavor just vanish. Science says so!  
  
But let's be honest. Unless you're drinking in a lab with a stopwatch and a temperature probe, hitting that zone and staying in it is pretty much luck based.  
  
Sooo…we made a thing. Because life's too short for mediocre temperature surprises, right?  
  
Say hello to the OutIn Nano—your go-to partner for perfect coffee, no matter the water temperature. Whether the water temperature you use is hot or cold, the Nano’s smart extraction system ensures your coffee lands at that ideal sipping temperature every time. No tech confusion, no desperate microwave reheats. Just consistently great coffee, exactly how it should be. No more worrying about water temp—we've got it covered.

so naturally i grabbed puppy and went to the grocery store and bought a bunch of stuff to ferment so that i can avoid making coffee in the morning and i have a legitimate reason to start the day with a cocktail.

i bought a 335g jar of bon maman bosbessen, a bottle of drop siroop, and 500g of bramen. eyeballing the quantities i added nescafé (lots), the confiture, about 70ml of the siroop, generous pectinase, some nutrients, and enough water to make a slurry. gave it a good shake and adjusted the siroop until the taste was right. coffee is very intense. i think licorice is likely much stronger.

i expect this to wild ferment pretty hard, but there’s a little preservative in the siroop. if that prevents wild fermentation, i’m gonna overpitch 1118 on top.

I was very careful at making it a one time purchase and not a subscription. I received my coffee box for 57$ and 30 days later they charge me 80$ for a auto refill, after contacting them through the chat bot on their website emailing their email and calling the number that never answers and advise to text the number instead I received an answer that I could cancel my subscription any time so I logged on it says I have no subscription and I have never cancel the subscription I continue to email them and chat with no and they keep saying I can simply cancel my subscription anytime but there’s no options to cancel anything once you were there, long story short I had to fight with them for all morning they told me that it was too late for this shipment. It’s already started even though they took the payment this morning at 12:12am and I was contacting right before the business opened explaining that the payment came out today it’s not too late when you walk in the word cancel my order instead of walking over there and shipping it. They acted like this was not possible. I can tell at this point this is their normal operation. I finally got my refund after about 4 1/2 hours of fooling around. 

Here’s the scam from my point of you you sign up for a one time purchase, but you didn’t notice the tiny little spot that says auto re-ship there is no way to unselect it. It’s not even an option so when you sign up for a one time purchase $57 for the entire box with the wooden bowl it comes with an $80 refill for life once you log into the website and try to cancel it that is not an option you’ll see you have no subscription and nothing else to change, it doesn’t even show you have auto refill, so be aware, the way they want this to operate is you can’t cancel that auto refill. You can’t call them and talk to anyone and get anything done. You’re expected to postpone the next months shipment and continue to do that for life knowing you’ll miss a month and they’ll get to send it to you. 

if you’ve been affected by this and you have been if you did “one time purchase” , you are a victim lol I recommend you also get back on their website go to the bottom and you’ll see something that says remove/delete my information and do not give to third parties because they clearly state they use third parties and send your information to them for a better experiences and what not lol

I did (and am still doing) some basic digging, but would appreciate actual experience and opinion, especially considering taxes for foreign talent. Sharing a glimpse of my lifestyle (and possible expenditure) below for better context: 

1. **I would prefer a one-bedroom apartment** in a decent, safe area, and would appreciate a good weightlifting gym in the proximity, if not a park. Would also like to know if furnished apartments would make a better choice or not. The internet says it can vary between USD 400 - 600
2. Idea of possible costs associated with the apartment (wifi, electricity, water bill, service charges)?
3. I am big on coffee, so that will be a daily staple for me
4. Will definitely sign up for a decent gym
5. Will move around using ride-sharing since I don’t know how to drive/ride
6. Although a fan of pho, I prefer eating homemade food on most days.
7. I do have a tendency to travel within Asia at least once a year.
8. I am also big on saving/investing at least 100-200 USD every month
9. Will have relevant female hygiene costs every month

Even before my birthday came, I was already drowning in birthday blues, knowing how much we’re struggling financially. I never wished for a grand celebration, I never needed anything extravagant—I only wanted to feel remembered, to feel appreciated, even just once.

Turning 21 feels like such a big step. For women, there’s the 18th debut, and for me, I thought at least it would be a moment to feel special too. I didn’t expect a huge occasion, but of course, I secretly hoped for at least some drinks, some laughs, maybe a small gathering with my friends. Deep inside, I just wanted to feel like that day mattered.

But because of our financial situation, I slowly accepted the reality that what I imagined was impossible. I had to be practical—college tuition is expensive. Still, I tried to hold on to the thought of making that day a little special, even just with a simple coffee date with friends.

So I asked my mom not to plan anything big. I told her all I wanted was a small budget to treat my friends after class. She tried so hard to save that money, holding onto it like a promise, hoping it would give me even a little happiness. Yes, this time, I chose to spend my birthday with friends instead of family.

But when the day came, I arrived at school hoping at least someone would remember. After all, four or five of us have birthdays close together. But I didn’t have the courage to remind them—I was too afraid they’d think I was being self-centered or acting like the “main character.” So I stayed quiet, building my walls higher.

After class, everyone seemed busy, eager to go home. And who am I to stop them, just for my moment? I felt like I was only borrowing their time anyway.

To make things worse, in my organization, one of my co-members has the same birthday as me. Our group chat was filled with greetings for her, but me? Nothing. In class, it happened again—another classmate shared my birthday, and everyone remembered her. And me? I was just a shadow, invisible in the corner, numb and unsure what to feel.

So here I am… spending my 21st birthday alone. No friends. No messages. No greetings—except from a few relatives, probably just out of family obligation. Everyone else moved on with their day while mine was supposed to mean something.

In the end, I just bought myself a slice of cake and a coffee at Starbucks. Sitting there, I struggled to hold back my tears, embarrassed to cry in public. After the coffee date with myself, I went straight to church and cried there—with all the pain I felt, with all the questions running through my head.

I’m sharing this not to speak badly about my friends, but because I honestly don’t know how else to express the heaviness I felt today.

All I wanted was to be able to participate in grabbing something for breakfast this morning while we were out extra early to drop the pup off for their neuter appointment. Of course the place we grabbed coffee at doesn't have any options for me. I was expecting that. But then we drove 15 extra minutes in the opposite direction through traffic to go to a vegan/gluten friendly bakery and cafe (I have a sensitivity and can handle small amounts of cross contamination) and when we get there I'm informed their gluten friendly options consist of..... chocolate chip cookies. 

I was so bummed and frustrated, I just shut down. And then cried quietly in the car. And then felt even worse because I felt immature for being so emotional about.....not getting breakfast. Rationally I know there's so much more to it than that, but knowing that doesn't erase the feelings. Holy shit the layers of emotions such a small aspect of life can bring on.

Anyways, the upside is now I'm channeling all of that negative energy into drive to bake my own damn stuff today. So at least there's some good coming out of it!

If you’ve ever tried sending Bitcoin by typing out a full wallet address, you probably know the feeling—squinting at 30+ random characters, copy-pasting, double-checking, and praying you didn’t mix up a “B” with an “8.” It’s like trying to recite the alphabet backwards after three cups of coffee. Not fun.

That’s where the magic of QR codes swoops in to save the day—and our **Free Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** is here to make sending and receiving Bitcoin as smooth as flipping open your phone’s camera.

👉 Try it now: [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com)

# From Chaos to Clicks

Bitcoin wallet addresses may be powerful, but they’re not exactly human-friendly. Imagine asking your friend to send you $20 worth of BTC and then handing them a cryptographic riddle to solve. That’s what typing an address feels like.

With our Bitcoin QR Code Maker, you skip the headache. In seconds, you can generate a sleek QR code that contains your wallet address—and even the amount you want to request. Your friend simply scans, taps “send,” and boom! Transaction done.

No typos. No guesswork. No anxiety sweats.

# Perfect for Everyone

Whether you’re:

* A **merchant** accepting Bitcoin for your coffee shop, t-shirts, or taco stand
* A **freelancer** getting paid from across the globe
* A **HODLer** casually collecting sats from friends who “owe you a beer”
* Or just a **Bitcoin enthusiast** who likes playing with new tools

…our QR Code Maker is your new best friend.

And did I mention it’s free? Yup. Free as in “no hidden fees, no subscription, no data-hungry nonsense.”

# Customize and Share in Seconds

Using the app is ridiculously simple:

1. Enter your Bitcoin wallet address.
2. (Optional) Add the amount of BTC you’d like to receive.
3. Click “Generate.”
4. Voilà—your personal QR code is ready to share!

Print it on a business card, slap it on your website, add it to an invoice, or display it on your phone when you’re face-to-face. The possibilities are endless.

One scan and people can send you Bitcoin instantly. It’s like magic, only better—because it’s backed by the power of the blockchain.

# Why QR Codes Are a Game-Changer

Let’s face it, in the digital age, people want things fast and simple. QR codes are universally recognized, supported by nearly every smartphone, and perfect for bridging the gap between complex crypto addresses and real-world payments.

Instead of wrangling with copy-paste gymnastics, your customers, clients, or friends can pay you with a quick scan. That means fewer errors, faster payments, and more time for you to do what you love—stacking sats and watching the orange coin go to the moon.

# Final Thoughts

Bitcoin is already the money of the future. Our **Free Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** makes it even more user-friendly today. Whether you’re accepting payments, requesting funds, or just showing off your Bitcoin style, it’s the simplest tool to make crypto payments seamless.

So stop memorizing wallet addresses like they’re secret spy codes. Generate a QR code in seconds and let your phone do the heavy lifting.

1n978vh,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1n978vh/aita_for_using_my_husbands_credit_card_to_take_my/,"AITA for using my husband's credit card to take my affair partner to Mexico, then calling him controlling when he found out?","Edit: [with ALL UPDATES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1128UY5FQA&t=168s)

I took my affair partner to Cancun using my husband's platinum card and now he's suing me for fraud.

My husband works 60 hour weeks at his law firm. I've been lonely for months. We barely talk anymore. He comes home exhausted and just wants to watch Netflix. I felt invisible in my own marriage.

I met someone at my yoga studio three months ago. He's funny, attentive, everything my husband isn't. We started texting, then meeting for coffee. One thing led to another and we've been seeing each other twice a week.

Last month I told my husband I needed a girls trip to reset. He was distracted, scrolling his phone.

""Whatever you need, babe. Just book it.""

I booked two tickets to Mexico using his American Express. We had the most amazing week. Beachfront suite, couples massages, expensive dinners. We felt like a real couple for the first time.

The bill was $8,000. My husband noticed when reviewing his statement.

""What's this Resort Luna charge? I thought you went to Sarah's lake house.""

My stomach dropped. ""Oh, plans changed. We decided on Mexico instead.""

""Eight thousand dollars? For a lake house trip?""

He started asking more questions. I panicked and confessed about the affair but spun it as emotional only. I said I needed space to figure things out and the trip was therapeutic.

""You took another man to Mexico on my credit card?""

""It wasn't like that. We just needed to talk through our feelings.""

He went nuclear. Started calling me names, threatening to tell my parents, saying he'd take everything in the divorce. I felt attacked and defensive.

I called my sister crying. Then my mom. Then posted on Facebook about how my controlling husband was trying to isolate me from friends during a difficult time in our marriage. I said he was financially abusing me and monitoring my spending.

My family rallied around me. My sister even offered to let me stay with her. Friends were commenting supportive messages about how I deserved better.

But then my husband's lawyer sent papers. I'm being sued for credit card fraud and theft. Apparently using someone's card without permission for personal expenses, especially to fund an affair, counts as a crime.

My affair partner stopped returning my calls when I told him about the lawsuit. Said this was ""too much drama"" for him.

Now my husband has screenshots of my Facebook posts and text messages that prove we were physical. His lawyer says my social media campaign makes me look manipulative and shows I was trying to avoid consequences.

My own family is starting to ask uncomfortable questions. My mom found out the real story and said I ""made my bed."" My sister rescinded her offer to let me stay.

I might have to file bankruptcy. I could face jail time. My reputation is destroyed. All my friends know the truth now and most have stopped talking to me.

The worst part is I genuinely thought my husband was being controlling. I convinced myself I was the victim because admitting I was wrong felt impossible.

But sitting here alone in this empty house, facing legal bills I can't afford, I'm wondering if I actually am the worst person here?",0,1757083576.0,FoundandExpose,2,0.33,False

BUT NO ONE REMEMBERED.""","I turned 21 today… but no one remembered. Even before my birthday came, I was already drowning in birthday blues, knowing how much we’re struggling financially. I never wished for a grand celebration, I never needed anything extravagant—I only wanted to feel remembered, to feel appreciated, even just once.

Turning 21 feels like such a big step. For women, there’s the 18th debut, and for me, I thought at least it would be a moment to feel special too. I didn’t expect a huge occasion, but of course, I secretly hoped for at least some drinks, some laughs, maybe a small gathering with my friends. Deep inside, I just wanted to feel like that day mattered.

But because of our financial situation, I slowly accepted the reality that what I imagined was impossible. I had to be practical—college tuition is expensive. Still, I tried to hold on to the thought of making that day a little special, even just with a simple coffee date with friends.

So I asked my mom not to plan anything big. I told her all I wanted was a small budget to treat my friends after class. She tried so hard to save that money, holding onto it like a promise, hoping it would give me even a little happiness. Yes, this time, I chose to spend my birthday with friends instead of family.

But when the day came, I arrived at school hoping at least someone would remember. After all, four or five of us have birthdays close together. But I didn’t have the courage to remind them—I was too afraid they’d think I was being self-centered or acting like the “main character.” So I stayed quiet, building my walls higher.

After class, everyone seemed busy, eager to go home. And who am I to stop them, just for my moment? I felt like I was only borrowing their time anyway.

To make things worse, in my organization, one of my co-members has the same birthday as me. Our group chat was filled with greetings for her, but me? Nothing. In class, it happened again—another classmate shared my birthday, and everyone remembered her. And me? I was just a shadow, invisible in the corner, numb and unsure what to feel.

So here I am… spending my 21st birthday alone. No friends. No messages. No greetings—except from a few relatives, probably just out of family obligation. Everyone else moved on with their day while mine was supposed to mean something.

In the end, I just bought myself a slice of cake and a coffee at Starbucks. Sitting there, I struggled to hold back my tears, embarrassed to cry in public. After the coffee date with myself, I went straight to church and cried there—with all the pain I felt, with all the questions running through my head.

I’m sharing this not to speak badly about my friends, but because I honestly don’t know how else to express the heaviness I felt today.

**Questions:**

**1. The ""please don't deport me"" question:**

I used one of those ""onward ticket"" rental services OnwardTicket com, (my sketchy-but-legal hero) to get into Thailand via my DTV. No immigration officer ever wanted to see it or looked at it. 😂 **Anyone had any drama using this in KL?**   
  
*To be crystal clear*: I don't intend to overstay. Never have and never will. Don't play those games. Ever. I simply want to remain flexible and keeping my options open for my next destination, which is currently a tie between Vietnam, Philippines and a nervous breakdown.. 😂

**2. The ""my budget is Ramen noodle luxury"" question:**

I need a quiet place for 3 months. Budget max **300 EUR/month**. I know this rules out the ""Instagram influencer gold-plated penthouse suite,"" and I'm totally cool with that. I'm looking for a place that has:

* A roof (negotiable)
* LAN cable internet (I have a travel reouter) that can handle a Zoom call without making me look like a pixelated prick
* Preferably not above a karaoke bar that only plays Nickelback (no offense to you Nickelback fans!)

AirBnB is obviously more pricer than normal rentals. **Any leads on local landlords, groups, or areas where I won't have to sell a kidney?** Concrete building names or areas are like gold to me.

**3. The ""I swear I'm here to work (mostly)"" question:**  
  
I need to find my people. The ones who talk about “synergy” unironically, but also know the best hawker stall for a 3 AM roti. **Any good networking groups, meetups, or business circles besides the usual suspects?** I'm in consulting (innovation, strategy, company building—fancy words for ""I help build want others put in PowerPoints for money"").

Height & Weight: 5'9"" | 75 kg

Location: Born and raised in Multan, Pakistan | Moving to the USA next year for work

Residence: Currently living with family in Multan; moving to the USA for my new role next year

Education: Bachelors in Computer Science; recently completed Masters in Artificial Intelligence from a well-known American university

Profession: Full-time Machine Learning Engineer at a multinational company (remote, paid in USD); recently promoted; also runs a small marketing business that’s still in its early stages; actively invests in stocks

Marital Status: Single, never engaged

Religion:

Moderate level of religiosity. Islam is very important to me, but I believe faith is personal and should not be imposed on others.

I try to live my values every day, but I’m not overbearing — respect, empathy, and personal growth matter as much as rituals.

Looking for someone who also values learning and growing in faith, without it being a competition of who prays more.

Why Marriage Now?

I’ve reached a point where I feel confident about who I am and what I want, both in life and in love. I’ve done my homework: reflected, learned from others, read books, and discovered what makes relationships thrive. For me, marriage is not a trophy or a social checkbox — it’s a partnership where both people grow, support, and make each other laugh even on a bad day. I’m ready to share that journey with the right partner.


---

Hobbies & Personality:

I’m mostly an introvert, though I have my extroverted outbursts (usually fueled by coffee or random bursts of energy). I love traveling — North Pakistan trips, four international tours, and countless little adventures along the way. I binge-watch sitcoms and rom-coms like it’s my cardio, and I’m a hopeless romantic at heart.

I love cooking and experimenting in the kitchen. Gym is part of my life (but no pressure — I’m not here to give anyone unrealistic six-pack expectations). I enjoy reading, writing, and deep conversations — the kind that make you think, laugh, or roll your eyes simultaneously.

If it’s a dark and rainy day, I’ll sit with you and hold you close — not just metaphorically, but emotionally. I’m the kind of guy who’ll try to make you blush, write poetry for you, and sneak little jokes to make you giggle when you least expect it.


---

What Makes Me, Me?

Reflective and caring: I’ve done a lot of self-learning and can now confidently say I know what makes a good husband.

Hopeless romantic: I love creating moments that make my partner feel cherished.

Independent and supportive: I believe in partnership, not control. I’ll support you, respect your choices, and share household chores — if I cook, you might get stuck with the dishes (fair trade, right?).

Ambitious and disciplined: Between my full-time work, my small business, and my investments, I keep myself busy — but I’ll always make time for what matters, especially for my partner.



---

Family Details:

Father is deceased; I live with my mother and two younger sisters, both studying.

We are close-knit and value mutual respect, care, and open communication.



---

Material Expectations & Where I Stand:

We own a house in Multan that I bought, but it’s under my mom’s name. My first personal goal is to build my own house, ideally in Islamabad, within the next 1.5–2 years if I end up staying in Pakistan.

I also run a small marketing business in its early stages.

I work remotely for a multinational company, paid in USD, which allows me to have a solid monthly income.

I own a Civic, a bike, and a couple of laptops, and I invest heavily in stocks.

If you expect instant luxuries or a lavish lifestyle, we probably won’t be a good match — I value growth, stability, and building a life together over flashiness.



---

Requirements for a Partner:

I’m looking for someone who:

Has a great sense of humor and knows how to keep a conversation going.

Isn’t afraid to speak her truth and has her own spark and personality.

Values connection over looks or superficial traits — although I do have a soft spot for short queens.

Is ready for an exclusive relationship that could grow into something lasting, eventually leading to marriage.

Loves laughing, sharing little adventures, and being herself.

Is based in Pakistan, since I want love to start where life is rooted.



---

Deal Breakers:

Lack of trust — I believe trust is the foundation of any real relationship.

Overly materialistic or someone who can’t hold meaningful conversations — I’d rather chat with a clever plant than feel like I’m talking to a wall.

Ultra-conservative households that limit open communication — I love long, heartfelt calls to truly get to know someone.



---

Preferred Family Setup: Nuclear

Do You Want Children?: To be discussed with my partner. I have some reservations since childbirth is painful, and it would hurt me to see my wife go through that. She is the one I want to protect from even a pebble, so we’ll decide together.

Timeframe for Marriage: After compatibility is established, within 1–2 years


---

Bonus Points About Me:

I was a proud cat owner (well, she owned my heart and soul), though sadly she passed away recently.

I love cooking and sharing household chores — partnership matters to me.

Hopeless romantic: I’ll write poetry, make you laugh, and try to make every day a little brighter.

Supportive and independent: I won’t control you, but I’ll always have your back.



---

Future Plans:

Moving to the USA next year for my new role.

Continuing personal growth in AI, career, and life skills.

Building a home of my own in the next 1.5–2 years (if staying in Pakistan).

Continuing to invest, grow my small business, and enjoy life meaningfully.



---

If you’ve read this far, thank you for your patience. I promise I’m more fun in real life than a text profile can convey. If this resonates, reach out with your profile so I can respond thoughtfully.

May life and love bring us laughter, growth, and a little bit of adventure. Insha’Allah, this journey will be meaningful for both of us.

linux is a kernel, but in the broader more popular context, is a term generalized to mean any environment that includes the Linux kernel. One of the things it is not, is ""an operating system"". Just like an engine isn't a car.

If you are interested in doing linux , learn what it is. Really, look into it . . . because if you are going to Linux you will need to learn. There is no way around that. Watch out however, every fanship has its schills that will lie to you to sell their product. I guarantee you at least one person replying to this will say ""in mint you don't have to know everything, it just works"", which is true to about 10 percent of users only. If you decide to give Linux a fair shot, line up some tutorials . . . learn the tools . . . don't think you are going to cut and paste your way to success . . . those are the people that wind up whining and complaining about how long they spend in the terminal. If you actually learn the terminal up front . . . you really don't wind up spending much time there ..  .unless of course you want to. Once you learn it, that is a very real possibility.

My real world comparison

Imagine if you just looked around and watched other people using chainsaws, then fired it up thinking how easy it looked. Then, you don't let the chain come to a stop before letting the saw dangle in your left hand, the chains rotation creates a momentum that turns the blade right into your leg. You are cut, would it  be the saws fault? So many of people cut their leg on linux, then blame linux. Learn to use the tool, or just user something else.

It is not a side not that ""Linux"" is created by people who work in their spare time, gratis mostly, around the world . . . in offices, or on laptops at a coffee bar, or in a garage. There is no one ""unified vision"". People make what they want and the best rises to the top. It is beautiful . . . and chaotic . . . and at times, confusing as hell . . . and if you don't take the time to get to know linux, you won't have much successk... let alone any fun. And it really CAN be fun.

One last thing, you don't have to choose between Linux and Windows and Mac any more than you have to choose between pizza and tacos and burgers.",0,1757082798.0,linuxsucks,1,0.5,False

An extra key from the Fanatical charity bundle. The game is a linear visual novel where you can only affect the story through the type of drinks you serve rather than dialogue choices. No player romance but you get to see NPCs fall in love as their stories unravel. It's one of the text-heavy games that really puts novel in visual novel. Basically like reading a book, but a very good and refreshing book!

Alrighty, so here's the plan: I am simply here to blackmail the local pigeons to help us in the turf war with the ducks. ( Maybe grab some tiramisu later. )

I need someone who loves cooking ( these pigeons need all the carbs they can get ) , who enjoys playing tennis ( the duck mafia boss hangs out at the tennis club every Sunday morning ) and who enjoys long walks ( we need to scout the ducks HQ to find weaknesses in their walls. )

But apart from that, I am just an energetic golden retriever puppy mixed with a sassy best girlfriend energy, but do love to curl up on a couch, reading a book and sipping tea.

I do enjoy learning about different cultures and mixing them all in my life, from Argentinian Tango to New Zealand Maori dances. ( I did grow up in the Middle East )

I also have a Starbucks coffee certification ( which doesn't help much but I kinda want to brag about it lmao )

I’m literally sitting here, super confused and almost 100% convinced I’ve either discovered a glitch in the Matrix...or the easiest job ever invented by humankind.

Beta tester jobs.

Yes—getting paid to TRY OUT NEW APPS. No degree. No 10-page resume. Zero experience. Holding ONLY my phone and a mildly caffeinated mind.

How?? I had to triple check this site before believing it, but here it is: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

This is where it gets crazy. I signed up and half expected to get instantly scammed or sucked into some survey black hole.

BUT NOPE. I’m actually testing real apps and making real 💸.

People—THERE IS NO CODING REQUIRED.

Here’s what it’s looking like for someone who thought tech jobs = MIT degree:

• Sign up at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
• Fill out some basic info (no, you don’t need to upload your passport and declare your first-born child)
• Get assigned new apps to try out—some games, some utility, some random stuff 
• Play around on your phone for 10-30 minutes, find bugs, write some thoughts
• Submit feedback
• GET PAID (sometimes in gift cards, sometimes in cash, depends on the app)

Is this the digital Cinderella story? Random person goes from doomscrolling socials to earning $10-$30 per test session? GUYS. 😳

And literally ANYONE can do this. 

UMA (Unemployable Millennial Anonymous) member here—I'm living proof you don’t need tech creds. They want REGULAR HUMANS (yes, with WiFi) giving honest feedback.

But let’s talk real for a sec. Is it super easy? 
In other words, will you quit your job and retire on a beach after a week of testing beta apps from **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**? Haaaa, no. But as a side hustle? Or for buying that ridiculously overpriced coffee? YES. 

Big bullet points to remember:
- No, you won’t get rich.
- YES, this is a legit path to some fresh ""doing something online"" $$$.
- NO interviews.
- YES, this is fun if you like tech, trying new things and giving your opinion.
- NO, you don’t need to be a genius.

Before you ask: scammers exist, so double check everything. For me so far, **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** has been solid.

TL;DR: Stop scrolling for FREE, start getting mini-paychecks to try apps you’d probably play with anyway.

If you’re a skeptical gremlin (like me), poke at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and see what happens.

Here I was scrolling in search of a nice side gig and stumbled across a wild list: remote mobile app tester jobs. Not kidding, these aren’t shady survey links. Major brands are fighting for your thumbs, eyes, and honest feedback. And guess what? **Some of these pay WAY MORE than you’d guess.**

I *had* to look deeper, and now I’m dropping gems for all my fellow tech-lovers and work-from-couch dreamers. Save this, send it to your grandma, and yes—bookmark it.

Here are 10 companies blowing my mind by hiring mobile app testers *remotely* in 2025 (yes, FULLY FLEXIBLE, sleep in if you want):

- **Rainforest QA** – Purely remote, global roles. No coding required!
- **Applause** – All you need is a device and basic internet. They test for the BIGGEST apps you already use.
- **UserTesting** – Feedback = dollars in your account. You literally get paid for opinions. Mind blown.
- **Testbirds** – Birds of a feather get MONEY together. Mobile, smart home devices, wearables—you name it.
- **Testlio** – Flexible, fun, and shockingly organized. Work wherever. Yes, even from the beach.
- **uTest** – The OG of freelancing for testers. Projects “fresher than my morning coffee.”
- **BetaTesting.com** – Start NOW, no experience necessary. Your early adopter dreams come true.
- **Global App Testing** – Brands give you unreleased apps and want YOUR feedback. 
- **Ferpection** – Smooth UX, chill team, payments on time. I had to double-check it was real.
- **GoodNovel** – Currently on a hiring spree. If you like reading and testing fresh apps, they’re giving away *real* money and rewards! I applied here: **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

I kept finding **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** on every recommendation and subreddit. Their vibe is surprisingly friendly to beginners. Want to join the gold rush? **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** is HOT right now.

Seriously, what is going on??? Flexible hours. IMMEDIATE remote work. Some of these testers share they make $25–$35/hr just… exploring apps and sharing thoughts!

And the list keeps circling back to **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** because their app tests are open in multiple countries and no complicated skills are needed.

I dunno who needs to hear this, but you, lounging there in PJ pants, could be cashing app money *tomorrow*.

Why let all this testing $$$ get snapped by someone else?  
Have you tried remote mobile app testing with one of these?  
Is this the side hustle silver bullet of 2025?

# 1. Conversational Commerce Taking Center Stage

The future of digital marketing in Chennai is conversational. Customers no longer want to browse endless websites—they prefer instant, interactive experiences. Social media platforms are evolving into **shopping assistants, service desks, and sales counters** all at once.

For example, instead of calling a boutique to ask about stock, customers will message directly on Instagram and receive immediate responses with purchase links. Restaurants will take table reservations entirely through chatbots. This **seamless blend of communication and commerce** is set to dominate local business strategies.

# 2. Regional Content Driving Mass Engagement

Chennai audiences are increasingly drawn to content in **Tamil and Tanglish (Tamil + English mix).** Businesses that once relied only on English ads are realizing the power of speaking the customer’s language. Future campaigns will lean heavily on **vernacular storytelling**—from Instagram reels with Tamil voiceovers to YouTube Shorts featuring local humor.

This shift means that even small shops can gain visibility, because relatability often beats big budgets. In a city where cultural pride is strong, **regional expression is the new digital currency.**

# 3. Community-Centered Marketing

The days of one-size-fits-all promotions are fading. Tomorrow’s social media in Chennai will focus more on **community engagement** than mass advertising. Brands will build digital communities around shared interests—be it fitness, food, parenting, or fashion—and nurture them with exclusive content.

For instance, a fitness studio might run a private Facebook group for members to share progress, while a local café could build a “coffee lovers” WhatsApp circle for early access to new brews. This **shift from broadcasting to belonging** will make businesses feel more human and approachable.

# 4. Seamless Integration of Online and Offline Experiences

Social media will no longer be just a promotional tool—it will **merge with physical experiences.** Chennai businesses will use QR codes, AR filters, and interactive displays to connect offline customers back to their digital presence.

Imagine walking into a salon and scanning a QR code that opens an Instagram filter to preview hairstyles, or dining at a restaurant where customers are encouraged to post with a branded AR sticker for discounts. These **blended experiences** will make marketing more fun, interactive, and share-worthy.

# Anna Nagar’s Digital Edge: Why Local Businesses Need Smart Social Media

# Anna Nagar: More Than Just a Neighborhood

Anna Nagar has grown far beyond being a residential zone—it has become a **thriving commercial hotspot** in Chennai. Its well-planned roads, connectivity to metro lines, and mix of premium residences make it a magnet for entrepreneurs. Walk down Shanthi Colony, and you’ll find global food chains, niche boutiques, wellness clinics, and high-end salons competing for attention. Unlike traditional markets like T. Nagar that focus heavily on wholesale shopping, Anna Nagar thrives on **experience-driven retail and services**. This unique mix positions it as a **miniature business district** where brands can experiment, innovate, and scale.

# The Rise of the Digital-First Shopper

Today’s Anna Nagar consumer doesn’t step into a store blindly—they’ve already “met” the brand online. Before trying out a new biryani outlet, they’ve checked Instagram reels. Before booking a beauty service, they’ve scrolled through reviews on Google Maps. Even fitness enthusiasts are watching local trainers on YouTube Shorts before walking into a gym.

This shift shows that the customer journey is now **digital-first, offline-second.** The feed has replaced the flyer, and stories have replaced static ads. Businesses that fail to adapt to this behavior risk becoming invisible—even if their physical storefront is in the busiest part of Anna Nagar.

# Why Local Expertise Matters in Social Media

Social media strategies that work globally don’t always click locally. A Pongal campaign designed for Chennai will outperform a generic “Happy Holidays” post because it feels authentic. Similarly, bilingual captions in Tamil and English resonate more with Anna Nagar’s urban-yet-traditional crowd than plain English promotions.

This is why **local social media expertise is crucial.** An expert who understands Anna Nagar’s culture, geography, and lifestyle trends can create campaigns that feel personal and relatable. They know when to run geo-targeted ads near Tower Park, how to use local slang in captions, and which festivals spark shopping frenzies. With this blend of creativity and local knowledge, businesses gain not just visibility but also **trust and loyalty from their community.**

# The Roadblocks of Managing Social Media for Anna Nagar Businesses

# 1. Tight Marketing Budgets

Most small and medium businesses in Anna Nagar—be it a boutique on 2nd Avenue or a café near Tower Park—operate with **limited advertising budgets.** Unlike large brands that can spend lakhs on campaigns, local stores often allocate only a small portion for social media. This creates a challenge: how to generate maximum visibility with minimal spend? A skilled handler must balance organic content, low-cost ads, and creative engagement to deliver results without straining the business owner’s pocket.

# 2. Navigating Language and Cultural Nuances

Anna Nagar has a cosmopolitan crowd—families who prefer Tamil, youngsters comfortable with English, and many who use both in conversation. For social media managers, this means creating **bilingual or Tanglish content** that feels natural. Too much English may alienate older audiences, while only Tamil might limit reach among younger professionals. Striking the right tone requires cultural awareness and a fine balance between **authenticity and accessibility.**

# 3. Competing in a Saturated Market

With salons, restaurants, and boutiques often just a few steps apart, Anna Nagar is a **hyper-competitive zone.** Every business wants to stand out online, but customers are bombarded with similar ads and promotions daily. This forces social media managers to think beyond discounts and festive offers—to craft unique hooks, trending content, and storytelling that makes one brand shine while others fade into the background.

# 4. Adapting to Constantly Changing Algorithms

One of the biggest hurdles for any social media handler is keeping pace with platform changes. Instagram favors reels one month and carousel posts the next. Facebook’s reach fluctuates, while Google Business reviews can make or break customer decisions overnight. For local businesses, missing these shifts can lead to sudden drops in visibility. An expert must stay updated, experiment often, and **pivot quickly** to keep brands consistently in front of their audience.

# What Lies Ahead: Emerging Social Media Shifts for Chennai Brands

# 1. Social Media as the New Customer Service Desk

In the coming years, customers in Chennai won’t just use social media to discover brands—they’ll use it as their **first line of support.** Instead of calling a store or waiting for email replies, they’ll expect instant answers via Instagram DMs, Facebook Messenger, or WhatsApp. For businesses, this means training teams to handle queries quickly online, turning platforms into **relationship-building hubs** rather than just marketing channels.

# 2. Rise of Hyper-Local Advertising

Chennai audiences respond best to ads that feel personal and **close to home.** The future will see businesses using even sharper geo-targeting—down to specific streets and metro zones. For example, a fitness studio in Anna Nagar can run promotions only for users within a 3 km radius, while a food outlet near Shanthi Colony can push “lunch hour specials” to office-goers nearby. This **pinpoint accuracy** will make advertising more effective and cost-friendly.

# 3. Content that Feels Native, Not Promotional

As users get more ad-savvy, the future will favor **authentic, relatable content** over polished corporate ads. A local boutique might gain more traction from a reel showing a behind-the-scenes sari draping tutorial than a glossy photoshoot. Similarly, restaurants may find more engagement through customer-made food reviews than big-budget video ads. The trend is clear—**raw and real storytelling will outperform scripted promotions.**

# 4. Blending E-Commerce with Social Discovery

Tomorrow’s Chennai shopper will discover, evaluate, and purchase—all within social platforms. Already, Instagram Shops and WhatsApp catalogs are simplifying this journey. Moving forward, businesses that integrate **frictionless shopping experiences**—like “tap to buy” on reels or direct checkout through chat—will attract and retain more customers. Social media will no longer just push traffic to websites; it will **become the marketplace itself.**

# Closing Thoughts: Why Social Media is the Growth Engine for Anna Nagar Businesses

In a neighborhood as vibrant and competitive as Anna Nagar, having a social media presence is no longer optional—it’s the **heartbeat of business visibility.** From retail showrooms to boutique cafés and wellness centers, every enterprise thrives when it speaks the digital language of its customers.

But here’s the catch: not all strategies work for all businesses. A salon may need reels showcasing quick transformations, while a restaurant might benefit more from customer-generated reviews and food vlogs. That’s why **customized strategies designed by local experts** make all the difference—they know when to tap into Pongal buzz, how to mix Tamil with English for maximum relatability, and where to place ads for real conversions.

The real value of social media is not just in likes or follows but in building **long-term trust and community.** By investing today, businesses secure customer loyalty for tomorrow. In Anna Nagar’s evolving market, the brands that adapt, personalize, and engage will be the ones that don’t just survive but truly **lead the way.**",1,1757082492.0,u_Forward_Spread_5127,0,1.0,False

* around my age, so 25-30

I hope this is the right place to post this.  
  
So a year ago I've graduated with a BS in Finance & Accountancy, and I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Banking and Risk Management.

Right now I'm doing a 6 month internship in Finance/Accounting at a Private investment bank (Wall-street, billions AUM, unnecessarily expensive coffee machines) and I'm doing so in Europe, more specifically Poland.

I've just gotten an offer to stay with them for 6 more months as an intern, which would total 12 months.

My official role is ""fund accounting/financial reporting"", doing mostly Real Estate and Private Equity - GL accounting, Consolidations, Controlling all that jazz.

Here’s the situation: in 12 months, I’ll be permanently moving to the U.S. I’m trying to figure out how my background (EU degrees + 1 year of fund accounting) will compare against U.S. grads who usually have local degrees and a few summer internships.

On top of that, do you guys think pursuing a career in fund accounting is a viable/realistic path, or should I pivot into something else?

Hi everyone, so i would like some insights on the situation, preferably from emirati women, as i wasn't in such situation before.

Iam in this situation at work, 4 or 5 months ago, this emirati girl started telling me work secrets involving her moving departmens (i barely knew her name back then), giving me multiple snacks without me reciprocating like 3 or 4 times (she never did such a thing with anyone else), almost always stopping me when i get coffee from kitchen (her desk faces the kitchen so crossing paths is unavoidable), to one point she told me while smiling ""you are the only guy i speak to in office"" while her confidant friend was standing with us and my reaction was speechless i didn't say a word and was surprised! Eventually i took the hint and grabbed her number but she told she doesn't use WhatsApp alot which i got the hint and respected.

All of this happened because i get coffee alot and she can stop me when am leaving office kitchen, so she was probably building the courage. She's very shy and doesn't speak with alot of people, her voice is barely heard during office hours.

She kinda took a step back when she noticed that i started reciprocating and took the hints, but past couple of weeks were kinda awkward as i texted her on WhatsApp and felt she didn't like it although after a couple of days i told her i didn't mean to cross any boundaries but she said it's ok and she wasn't even thinking about it from what it sounds, but here i did a mistake and i pressed if everything is good and mentioned an incident that someone else asked me about work issue related to you (indicating that why she didn't ask me herself) to which she replied and i noticed a shift in her tone, like she got angry or frustrated, (there's nothing between me and you to make me mad) i told her ok, that was over office phone.

Also a month back she went on a one week vacation and told me where she's going and not to tell anyone and asked me if i want anything and said no to which she replied (really i mean it, you want anything? It's not between us)

1n96jtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1n96jtv/is_this_divorce_my_fault/,Is This Divorce My Fault?,"

My soon to be ex wife of 7 years (29F) and I (33M) are divorcing. She decided to have an affair and ruin our marriage. This is the 2nd time this has happened in 7 years. I caught her talking to another man for about 3 months, saying she's in love with him. She met him on IG and he cosplays and works security for a living. He also lives in one of the worst areas in Chicago and works minimum wage and has no land, assets or finances to speak of. She claims to be head over heels for him and shes only spoken to him on the phone and over messenger. Never met him in person.

Long story short, we've had a rough 7 years. We have been broke, homeless for a time, we struggled financially but I never gave up and stayed faithful. Im not here to bash her and say I was perfect so Ill start with my mistakes. As a firefighter I worked 48 hour shifts, 72 hours a week and was gone over 6 months out of the year destroying my body to provide for us. I was mentally absent on most holidays and birthdays, not because of my sleep apnea and constant exhaustion but because the performance anxiety I would get during these times of the year was overwhelming.

I grew up being verbally abused by women my entire life so I have become very non confrontational and withdrawn during fights with her. If I messed up at all during dates, birthdays and holidays it would turn into an 8 hour argument. She has destroyed many birthday gifts I've given her in front of me or gave them away. Her biggest claim to be acting like this is due to me not performing adequately during these days. I've also become distant after arguments due to my childhood and once she gets mad, there is no stopping her. I avoided taking her out in public because she has started fights over nothing and has no problem demasculating me in front of my boss, coworkers, friends and strangers. Happened on many occasions. These were the extent of my ""sins"" against her, and this is what shes held on to over the years and used to justify both of her emotional affairs and all the abuse.

She would often scream in my face and say the most evil, vile disgusting things, literally doing this for 8 hours or more at a time. When id try to separate myself she would block me in and then the hitting and pushing would start. Once she finally started to give up and id find my way to bed, she would purposely keep me awake most nights so I would be as exhausted as possible before work. Being a Captain in charge of a crew of 4-8 people, I have to deal with quick decision making that can lead to the life or death of my crew, myself or my patient. She knew and did not care. The health deterioration I've had over the past 7 years due to sleeplessness and stress has been noticeable.

To give you an example of what shes been like, I'll discuss a few key events I've held on to and still have yet to get over. When we got engaged I gave her a family heirloom as a placeholder until I could afford a ring. I am a disabled veteran and come from a long line of WW2/Vietnam vets. My great aunt smuggled an engagement ring out of Nazi occupied Austria which was in my family for generations. My aunt who was beautiful at the time, would spend months dressing up in rags as an elderly woman and walking with rocks in her shoes so she wouldn't forget to ""limp"". She escaped by hiding her beauty and going unnoticed for years. I gave her this ring and after a few months, she got tired of waiting and smashed it with a cinder block while I was in basic training.

She knows I grew up without a dad and how much having a family meant to me. We often spoke of having kids until she changed her mind years ago. She forced me to get a vasectomy so she could get off of hormonal birth control (which I admit gives women a lot of side effects) so out of love I agreed. This devastated me but I did it. She told me a few weeks after the procedure that she would never want to carry my seed because slight aspergers runs in my family and she basically told me I had ""junk DNA"" and would never want to have my child. Not only has she had 2 emotional affairs, but the wants to have a child with the man she cheated with, which blew me away.

She has completely cut me off from my family and isolated me. She used to sneak into the bedroom while I slept and go through my phone. If she saw me recently conversing with my family she would wake me up and start the 8 hour argument all over again, for example.

She sent me to the emergency room by purposely slamming a door in my face when I followed her into the house after an argument. She threw hot coffee on me and when I followed her inside, she slammed it and the glass on the door severed through my right wrist and forearm and I started bleeding out immediately. One time she grabbed my head while we fought in the bathroom and smashed it against the wall, cutting open the top of my head. So she has a long history of putting her hands on me, besides the verbal abuse. She would also purposely injure herself and blame it on me.

I literally fainted on my ring cam just due to the stress of all this last month. She took the ring cam footage, made a music video out of it and sent it to the guy shes cheating with, with a caption that read ""He's crashing out"". This was also incredibly painful to see. I have developed a heart condition due to a vax injury I got in the service so I wouldnt lose my career and my ability to provide...and this is how Im rewarded for it. I've literally ruined my health and body to keep this marriage going and provide for her. She has alo refused to work our entire marriage so everything we have ever owned, I bought it.

Its been 7 years of physical and emotional abuse. She has demasculated me time and time again. Then the multiple affairs. These are just some of the things shes done. I could go on and on but I already see how much I've written. I guess I just need to vent because I've kept this trauma in the entire time and never told anyone. Her family has also cut her off over this and said her and this new guy will never be welcome for holidays or gatherings, but I Will be. Other than the grief and pain of all this, my quality of life has improved significantly since she left, and I sign papers in a few days. Her family got her to admit to abandonment and adultery on the divorce papers so it should be in my favor, and she agreed to not come after my assets. She has also committed financial abuse, spending hundreds of dollars she knew was set aside for bills on crap like costume jewelry and clothing she doesnt need. Also a history of compulsive lying that both her family and I known about.

Even after all this, I said Id forgive her and take her back. She said no. She shows no remorse or grief over anything shes done, not ONCE in 7 years have I had a sincere apology. I told her I did not want to be the one who filed for divorce because I tried to fix it, so she agreed to do it. I blame myself. I saw the red flags and still married her young and dumb. I struggled with confronting her due to my childhood trauma and let her get away with crossing these boundaries and all the disrespect and abuse. I can't blame anyone but myself. Thank you for reading and letting me vent. But...was I the Problem? Did I deserve this?",4,1757081958.0,Divorce,9,0.83,False

1n96ie1,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1n96ie1/my_girlfriend_has_a_male_best_friend_that_is_too/,My girlfriend has a male best friend that is too close for comfort,"My girlfriend (25F) and me (26M) have been dating for a year and a half now, we met on a dating app and didn’t know each other before that. Currently, we’re at the best stage of our relationship, very in love, ready to settle down and plan for home buying and eventually kids etc, we’re both excited.

She has a male best friend (25M), who is also just her literal best friend, who she has known since high school, for over 10 years. They’ve been through thick and thin as friends, and he’s seen her go through multiple year long relationships, some really serious ones and even some casual flings too, all the while he was in one short and insignificant relationship in high school, and for most of their relationship has been single.

From what I’ve been told by her, it’s because he is very socially awkward, lacks a lot of confidence especially if the interactions aren’t one on one, and at the same time he is “unbothered” with the prospect of dating anyone, but he does have friends he is comfortable with and one of his closest in life is my girlfriend.  Because of that closeness between them, obviously there is history there.

One day before we matched on the app, they both went out for dinner and drinks, drank a lot and very nearly ended up sleeping together. In her words to me, “we kissed, we were unclothed, and we were about to and then I said “no what are we doing we have to stop””, and then they stopped.  That was the only time they’ve ever kissed.

She came around within the days that followed, clarifying to him and to her female best friends, that she really regret her decisions that night, both ultimately agreeing they didn’t want it to impact their deep bond. And so when me and her had gotten off the dating app and were going on our first dates, she was dealing with the fallout of this mistake.

He pressed hard for the next month saying that he had feelings for her and he was trying to make that relationship materialise.  It was stressful for her dealing with the gifts that he’d started sending to her and the arguments they were having about that, while dating me as we were really hitting it off.  I did ask her when she first told me that “it happened so recently before I came into the picture, have you really sat with your thoughts and feelings about him?” And she was adamant that she had processed everything and was clear she wanted to continue to date me and continue to be his friend.

This was now around a year and half ago.  In that time we did have our fair share of arguments about my anxieties about their relationship, some of my jealousies about their shared past that I had to work on. But we worked through all of that and our relationship is the best it’s been. However, here’s where the red flags I have tried my best to justify and ignore come: she loves all of her friends and family so much, she’s a genuinely really sweet person that way, and the way she loves me, she’s obviously introduced me in that time to all of her family and friends (who are all otherwise girls), but of course, I haven’t met him yet.

Another potential red flag; they text. Every day. The guy she’s claimed is too socially awkward to meet me (two of the most important people she says she has in her life) in a group of three because it would “feel like a thing”, has plenty to say to my girlfriend everyday on text.

Next red flag: the dinners. They have always bonded over food being foodies, and on occasion they go out to try new dinner places together, where he is insistent on paying the bill because “it’s his love language” and his social awkwardness means monetary expression is the best way to show he cares, which I do understand, but truthfully, despite one on one candlelit dinners having a romantic undertone regardless, she knows she is going to be a getting an expensive and lavish 3 course meal for free when she eats with him, and she’s kind of subtly laughed about it before.

I explained to her that power dynamic makes me uncomfortable and she said she sees why I say that, and next time she’ll endeavour to “think differently about it”.

Next red flag, a big one: the dynamics.  I told her recently I need more clarity about their relationship and she’s opened up to me a lot more since.  Last week she explained “we don’t have deep conversations or flirt, we just talk about food or dogs or sports. Even my mum says we’re like siblings, our whole dynamic is based on teasing each other and making fun of each other.” - and I’ve seen the texts from him; he teases her, makes sarcastic and “cruel” comments and she plays into it, saying things like “rude”, “that’s so mean” etc.

He also is very cheeky and knows how to press her buttons, he often very subtly references their close call under the guise of an inside joke and the mixed signals she gave him, and she often laughs at it - on occasion she has told him to behave, but it’s much rarer than her replying with “hahaha”, and I feel like sometimes, she almost very subtly even plays into it.

A big part of their dynamic on text too is this push-pull thing, where he doesn’t see her much in person at the moment to hang out for a coffee or dinner, saying he’s busy with work, and he teases saying “I’ll see you next year then” and she plays into it saying “I really miss you”, “am I ever gonna see you again”.

I asked her to be honest about if the teasing ever transpires into flirting and she is adamant that it never does, but honestly this feels like really subtle flirting to me, she’s kind of playing this submissive begging role and he’s playing the nonchalant I don’t need you kind of thing.

They also have this weird inside joke where he says he fancies her older sister, and she says she fancies his male cousin, and they often joke about this.  To me this might feel like intentionally misplaced flirting, again under the guise of a harmless joke.

Also, I saw a text from November, deep into our relationship, where they were teasing each other, and he said “I almost said good girl, I’ve been spending too much time with my dog”, she says “hahahahah, risky”, he replies “good girl”, then a GIF of someone throwing something then ducking, and she just replied back with the eye roll emoji.  I’m worried that although she doesn’t actively encourage it, she doesn’t shut it down sometimes, leaving the door open and thus enabling this behaviour.

Final red flag and probably the reddest: she omits me when texting him. A lot. Not all the time, there are a handful of anomalies, but it is 95% of the time. If me and her go to a restaurant, she’d send him a picture of the menu saying “I went here today, you’d love it”. No mention of me. I get why that was the case when we were first dating, she didn’t want to rub things in his face, but she still does it to this day (and simultaneously tells me she wants to marry me, have my children etc).

This past valentines, our first together, we had the best weekend away - she texted him happy valentines. She sent pictures of the place we stayed at. But no mention of my name. Our anniversary dinner a few months ago, she said “I went here it was great” no mention of my name.  I booked a trip to Spain for me and her all paid for by me for her birthday later this month.

She teared up when I told her, saying it’s so romantic, she’s texted her family and her female best friends “my boyfriend has booked me a holiday for my birthday!”.

She texted him trying to find availability for a hangout or coffee this month, he said he could only do after 17th, that’s when we’re leaving.  She didn’t say she’s going away with me, she just said “I’m going to Spain then!”.  They then had the same conversation a week later about availability, and maybe he’d forgotten, but she said I can’t do after 17th remember, he asked why, she again says she’s going on holiday, and again doesn’t even mention me.  It feels at the very least like disrespect. I confronted her about this, she maintains that it’s not intentional. To me, it seems like a pattern.

I do feel guilty of course, but I’ve only gotten the information about their texts from having a look at her phone because until recently she wouldn’t tell me much about him out of fear of an argument.

It’s complicated because ultimately I am convinced shes not physically cheated or cheating on me, she doesn’t go to him with our issues, she spoiled me for birthday just gone, sometimes she posts me on her story without me asking and she really does love me.

My fear is that there is some secrecy, there is emotional/flirtatious charge, she has told me white lies previously when my confrontations have gotten a bit too much for her i.e. “I told him that WE went out for anniversary dinner” - she didn’t, she only said that she went there, the implication is there, but I wasn’t mentioned.

And I fear that if this continues the way it is, sly secrecy, me staying outside their bubble, her being okay with sometimes lying when it’s helpful to avoid conflict, him referencing their close call and her laughing it off, that boundaries are slowly over years (which is what we want to spend with each other) going to blur and maybe years down the line when we’re consumed with jobs and work and marriage, there will be betrayals deeper this.

The positives: we work really well together no doubt, and maybe there is opportunity to work through it. Finally, she has plucked up the courage to invite me and him, alongside all her friends and family to her birthday gathering at home in one month. So the plan is that I will finally get to put a name to the face. She is really actively trying to make an effort to be more transparent, i.e. although she didn’t know I already knew, yesterday she told me she shares this inside joke with him about him liking her sister and her liking his cousin. So there is some progression.
