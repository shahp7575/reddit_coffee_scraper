I work in an office where the coffee machine is often filled with tap water instead of filtered water, which makes the coffee taste awful. The problem is, the person doing this is my boss, and he’s very unpredictable. I’ve put up a polite sign asking people to only use filtered water, but he ripped it down and threw it away.

I’m considering bringing my own coffee machine from home for personal use, but I’m worried he might mess with it too, especially since he’s done similar stuff before. How can I set up my machine so he won’t use it or ruin it?

Any suggestions on how to handle this without creating more conflict would be appreciated!",1,1741342252.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

---

AI danced on the startup graveyard, chuckling as it filled another disruptive headstone. It's not just the tech headlines; it’s the eerie new reality—AI is swiftly becoming the boogeyman for many fledgling companies. With tools more adept at automating tasks than a hyper-caffeinated intern, AI is reshaping the startup ecosystem with the precision of a military-grade razor.

**Cracking the AI Whip: The Brutally Efficient Overlord**

Let's be honest, AI can often feel like that boss who sweetly says, ""Just keep doing what you're doing,"" while secretly compiling a list of your flaws. From content creation to customer service chatbots, AI's efficiency is undeniable. It's your workaholic friend who effortlessly manages ten tasks at once when you can barely squeeze in a trip to the coffee machine.

And who suffers the most? Startups. Why? Because while corporations use AI to optimize, startups squirm as it seizes their unique selling points—data analysis, predictive modeling, and even the occasional witty marketing copy. Imagine outsourcing your eureka moment to a server bank in Silicon Valley. Yikes!

**AI: The Frenemy You Love to Hate**

Yes, AI can be both the hero and the villain. It's the tech frenemy that promised us flying cars but thinks replacing your team with lines of code is a better idea. Need to streamline your operations? AI’s got your back. Need to keep the human touch? Uh… good luck with that.

AI isn’t about black and white; it thrives in the grey areas of innovation, efficiency, and, dare we say, redundancy. It’s like inviting a robot butler into the house, only to find it quietly evaluating how it might make you obsolete.

**Reddit, Over to You: Are We on the Verge of an AI-Dystopian Reality?**

AI takes decisions quickly—like a merciless chef slicing through onions—but does it slice through the soul of innovation too? Can startups navigate this new era, or is adaptation a myth sold alongside dreams of instant scalability?

Your thoughts, survival stories, or conspiracy theories? Spill it out and let's decide together if AI has killed your startup or merely served it a bitter cup of reality.",1,1741341891.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

1j5k5k7,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1j5k5k7/colorado_labor_laws_re30_min_lunch_taken_from_pay/,"Colorado labor laws re/30 min lunch taken from pay, and no paid breaks given","I work at the airport deicing planes. We clock in at ""base"" outside of the airport restricted area, and then are bused to the work area and cannot leave until picked up at our assigned truck or the designated breakoom at the end of our shift. Usually the work area is our assigned deicing truck for the day,  where we run through our pre-inspection checklist as soon as we are dropped off, and then are required to drive straight to the assigned deicing pad and wait in our truck for airplanes to come to the pad to perform the deicing. No opportunity to put food in the breakroom/ fridge etc, grab water or coffee, or use the restroom. And if you come early to eat or use the restroom before shift, that is not paid time even if clocked in already.

There are lots of moments throughout a shift (6.5 hours, 8 hours, 10-12 hours plus) where you sit around and wait, but are still in an on call status. (Ex: I have deiced airplanes in 60 degree weather where we had to rush to our trucks from the breakroom and hurry out to meet the plane already parked in the bay who wanted deiced. No other planes were deiced that day because it wasn't cold enough, yet that one plane was afraid of icing after takeoff and climbing through the clouds.) Anyway, there are many shifts where we come in and check-out our trucks and then sit and wait in the breakroom for the rest of the shift and never get a ""positive plane"" who requests deicing. On these shifts we have free access to use the bathroom, make personal phone calls, eat meals, etc, and they take 30 min out of our pay for that shift for an unpaid lunch break. It is impractical for us to leave the airfield to clock out at base then come back. 

^This seems in line with CO's labor and wage laws. 

However, other shifts we are left on the pad or in the truck parking area, in our trucks, for the whole shift, on standby and not afforded a paid 10 minute bathroom/personal break or unpaid 30 min meal break, at all. We must be listening to radio and be able to immediately respond if called, and be able to begin deicing or drive to our assigned deicing pad at a moments notice which may ir may not come. In these situations, the operator must radio to request a personal break from a superior, and it is often denied, and sometimes is granted later, if they remember, because ""we have planes coming"", or ""we have the potential for them to start arriving soon"", or ""there is no one available to come get you right now"",  etc. This often happens on days where there is a fair chance for precip that doesn't materialize, but we were on standby the entire shift and not afforded a proper ""duty free"" break outside of our truck. They still take 30 min out for lunch on these days,  because we ""didn't spray any planes"".  

^I believe this is illegal

Also, during actual snow/weather event days where there is active, steady precip, they don't take a lunch break out of our pay, but they also dont allow a full 10 min or more frequent/shorter 5 min break that is ""duty free"". The only opportunity for a break is literally when you run out of fluid and have to come off the pad and top off your truck. Which you often have to do by yourself, and then they expect you to go get right back out there and start deicing again = NOT A BREAK. No time to go inside and get a hot coffee or heat up food, let alone sit and scarf it down real quick, or go use the restroom, etc. If you do one or more of these things, even expediently, you are harrassed and hurried and even followed around, and coerced to get back in your truck and get back out to the pad. I have even been told to ""throw away (my food) and get out there"" and have witnessed  many other coworkers suffer the same treatment. The food was not reimbursed by the company either. 

^This is for sure illegal.

Related to the above, I have recently been accused by management of ""insubordination"" for telling a manager that «once I finish my food I will go back out and move my truck"" (and return to my assigned standby area). I and several other employees (6-8 total) had been forgotten about and left in our trucks on standby for ~3 hours, while the rest of the shift (50+ other employees) were eating food the company had provided and were just hanging out that whole time. I had to ask 3 times for a break to go heat up some food, and was finally allowed to take a quick personal food/bathroom break. I topped off my fluids and then came in the breakroom to microwave and quickly eat some food, and discovered the rest of the crew who'd been there this whole time. A few bites in, was told I needed to move my truck. I explained that there was another vehicle in the way where I had to park, and that I would move it after that vehicle was moved. They left to check out what i had said. Another manager came over and I had to explain it again, and had in this short time eaten more bites of food, and while not my full meal, was approaching the last few bites of that particular piece of my meal. By then, someone had moved the blocking vehicle and I was expected to get right up and take my food with me to go get right in my truck and drive it back to my standby location across the airfield, and prepare to start spraying for the next several hours. So I said that as soon as I finished my last couple of bites, I would do just that. 1-2 minutes later I was in my truck and driving (2/3 OF MY MEAL STILL UNEATEN, ~ 4‐5 MIN SPENT EATING, BUT NOT A BREAK BECAUSE ASKED TO WORK AND SPEAKING WITH MANAGERS) and less than 10 minutes later I was the first one ready to go onto the pad and begin spraying. Shortly thereafter I was pulled off the pad and taken to base to be acused of insubordination, written up for it, and sent home early. DEF LOOKING FOR ADVICE ON IF THIS EXCHANGE SPECIFICALLY WAS ILLEGAL. 

Lastly , the company often incentivizes employees to stay late during heavy snow and weather events by adding hours to our timecard if we ""volunteer to stay"" until the last flight has left for the night? Often at 1 am. They bully and coerce employees who signed up for and were given a shift that ends at noon or 2 pm to stay for a double shift (till 1030pm or later), or a shift that ends at 1030 pm, to stay till midnight or 1am, by radio calls that everyone else can hear, or by text or phone calls, from multiple different managers and supervisors, to try to force employees to stay. Even when employees say that they cannot stay late today, they often are forced to anyway, because they are not given permission to leave their deicing pad and are sent several more aircraft to spray up to and past their scheduled out time, then once finally relieved and allowed to exit the pad, they must then refil their truck, turn in radios, paperwork, and other equipment and then drive their truck all the way across the airport to the parking location and then wait for a ride back to base to clock out. This process can take 30+ minutes just to get to the part where you are waiting for pickup and a ride off the airfield to base. That part can take 30-45 additional minutes to even over an hour on really busy shifts. While all that time is paid, I believe that these practices are also illegal.

Imagine opening the door to your startup one morning and finding a shiny AI robot sitting at your desk, feet up, sipping your coffee. ""Hi, I'm the new you,"" it chirps. Welcome to the bizarre yet fascinating world where AI isn't just a tool—it's a competitor.

Did you know that according to recent studies, 40% of companies adopting AI see a drastic reduction in their workforce needs? That's not just some distant dystopian scenario; it's today's reality.

**The Battle of Bytes**  
AI is reshaping industries faster than you can say ""machine learning."" The kicker? It's doing a fab job in roles traditionally held by humans—think customer service, data analysis, and even creative tasks like writing and design. For startups, this means you either evolve by integrating AI or become its next snack.

**Startups in the Crosshairs**  
Here's where it gets quirky. Startups are supposed to be nimble, right? However, integrating AI isn't just about slapping a chatbot on your website. It's a complete restructuring of how the biz operates. And for fledgling companies, it often means rethinking your entire value proposition.

**Adapt or Die Trying**  
But let's not write the eulogy just yet. Many smart startups are thriving by using AI as a partner, not a rival. They're harnessing its power for predictive analytics, customer insights, and even automating mundane tasks. The trick lies in identifying AI's strengths and using them to enhance human creativity and decision-making.

So, is AI killing startups or is it just weeding out the ones resistant to change?

Firstly, I would like to clarify that I am not a malicious pot stirrer. I am aware that there are usually *numerous* songwriters involved in making a song what it is and the lyrics rarely, if ever, actually reflect what the singer/performer actually believes in. I recently heard ""Our First Time"" by Bruno Mars and noticed there's a lot of ambiguity in the lyrics. I've previously done a lyrical breakdown of ""Locked Out Of Heaven"" and ""Fat, Juicy and Wet"" here. Feel free to tell me what you think.

***a) Don't it feel good, babe?*** – I mean, sure, unless you count the existential dread creeping in at 2 AM.

***b) Cause it's so brand new, babe!*** – Like a puppy? A fresh bag of chips? A suspiciously cheap used car? The possibilities are endless.

***c) And now here we are… in this big old empty room.*** – Ah yes, nothing says romance like the ambiance of an unfurnished studio apartment. Should we sit on the floor and pretend we have a couch, or just embrace the echo and start a cappella group?

The first three lyrics imply that the song is about the awkwardness of moving into a new place before your Amazon furniture arrives. 

***d) Starin’ at each other, who’s gonna make the first move?*** – Probably whoever gets tired of this awkward staring contest first. Or whoever realizes there's only one folding chair and someone has to claim it.

***e) Been doing our thing for a minute, and now both our hearts are in it.*** – By ""our thing,"" do we mean aggressively pretending we’re comfortable sitting on the hardwood floor? Because my lower back disagrees.

***f) The only place to go – is all the way, ooh baby.*** – ""All the way"" to… ordering a futon? Finally caving and getting takeout after saying we’d cook in this empty kitchen?

***g) Is that alright? Is that okay?*** – Not really, but we’re in too deep now. Let’s just accept our fate and embrace this air mattress lifestyle.

***h) Girl, don’t no need to be nervous*** – Nervous? In an empty room with questionable acoustics and a single IKEA lamp? Nervous is realizing we forgot to buy toilet paper.

***i) 'Cause I got you all night*** – But do I have WiFi? Because let’s be honest, no one’s surviving a night in an empty apartment without at least scrolling mindlessly for comfort.

***j) Don’t you worry about a thing, babe*** – Except for the fact that we’re sitting on the floor like medieval peasants, contemplating our life choices.

***k) Just go with it, go with it, go with it*** – Ah, the mantra of every first-time renter who convinces themselves that “minimalism” is a choice and not just the result of being broke.

***l) And I will go real slow with it, slow with it*** – Slow? Like our delivery guy who’s been “on the way” for two hours? Or like the realization that we don’t even own a single fork?

***m) It’s our first time*** – Our first time *what*? Sitting on a pile of laundry as makeshift furniture? Emotionally bonding over the struggle of assembling a coffee table with one tiny Allen wrench?

***n) Go with it, go with it, go with it*** – At this point, what choice do we have? Accept the floor life. Become one with the floor. The floor is our new home now.

***o) Clothes are not required, for what we got planned*** – Ah yes, not because of passion, but because all our clothes are still in moving boxes and somehow, we only unpacked the weirdest items first.

***p) Ooh, girl, you’re my desire, your wish is my command*** – Unless your wish is furniture, in which case, we’re at the mercy of a 7-10 business day shipping window.

***q) Treat you like a princess, ooh girl, you’re so delicious*** – A princess? More like a royal subject of the kingdom of Bare Minimum, where the throne is a single upside-down laundry basket.

***r) Like ice cream on a sunny day, gonna eat you before you melt away, hey hey hey*** – A bold metaphor, considering our fridge hasn’t even been plugged in yet, and the only thing in there is a questionable condiment left by the previous tenant.

***s) Babe*** – A term of endearment? Or the sound of desperation as we realize the WiFi still isn’t set up and our only source of entertainment is an unassembled bookshelf and our own bad decisions?

The conversational tone utilized here proves that love, much like that apartment, is an exercise in patience, adaptability, and the willingness to accept that that night's dinner will be eaten cross-legged on the floor, using a single plastic spoon that they found in an old takeout bag. Romance whispers in the air, but so does the echo of an empty room, reminding you that love is not just about grand gestures—sometimes, it’s about finding comfort in the discomfort, embracing the chaos, and accepting that, for now, the only ""bed"" is an air mattress that will 100% deflate overnight. So go with it, go with it, go with it. Because in the grand scheme of life and love, the floor is temporary, but the memories (and lower back pain) last forever.",1,1741341666.0,BrunoMars,1,1.0,False

Unfortunately, over the last few weeks, I've noticed clear signs of fleas - both cats scratching excessively and waking up with itchy red bumps all over my body.

Naturally, I started freaking out for obvious reasons - I can't stand the thought of little buggers sucking my blood whilst I'm asleep. Also, I seem to get quite bad reactions from these bites and I spend all day scratching them until the skin rips. It also keeps me up as I keep thinking I can feel them biting me.

I immediately washed all the sheets, covers, pillow cases, and went to pets at home, bought a large flea killer spray, and thoroughly washed both cats in the bath with dishwashing soap and a flea comb. I then proceeded to hoover the entire house and spray more flea killer everywhere. I then washed all the clothes everyone had on in the house on a 60 degree wash.

They persisted.

They seem to naturally prefer me over my wife. One day it was a couple I noticed, then the next day, few more, and more, etc. It got to the point where I tried sleeping with long sleeve tees and trousers tucked in socks whilst in bed (awful experience for me as I usually sleep just in boxers). Still got bitten on my ankles (I guess the trouser leg came out of the sock in my sleep). I'm getting more and more frustrated as the days go by. I then went back to pets at home to pick up more products, including foggers and industrial strength spray. I plan on asking my mother to pick up my wife and son tomorrow to take them out for the day, whilst I go Bruce Willis mode on these fleas. This morning, I decided we needed a couple more foggers and another flea powder which can be sprinkled on carpets. I was concocting my plan of attack for tomorrow. 

My wife just so happened to be going through the same retail park where Pets at Home is. I asked if she could pick up what I needed and she said she wasn't spending £50 on it. I started to get quite mad as I honestly feel I have not just taken the lead in trying to sort this problem out, but am actually willing to do it all (and she can enjoy her Saturday going for lunch with our son). She then said she was only going there for a coffee and didn't want to have to carry the stuff back. I then got in a huff and said fine I'll do it myself. But now things are sour, and I am actually really pissed to the point I want to just say ""fuck it, I'm not gonna bother doing it then."".

 The dream was like this: my boyfriend and I were at my uncle's house as usual, and my uncle showed up there complaining and asking for help, so I told him that he should go to the light and rest.

 Then my uncle took the probe out of his nose, laughing at me, saying it was great.
Death for him was like being hit by a bullet on the corner and losing it along the way, my uncle was laughing and joking.

 Then I asked him why he was at home, he had said he had chosen that place to rest at night, I said ""rest from what?"" And he said that he works in the coffee department at a law firm in Chile, so every night he traveled the world and came to his house (Brazil) to sleep (he didn't look sleepy)
We spent hours in the dream chatting, I saw some bizarre animals around the house (like Pokémon hypno), he said they were nature spirits, they were like ants.
Then the day dawned and my uncle disappeared out of nowhere, and a lot of people arrived at my uncle's house, as if my shift there had ended.
Then one of my grandmothers (on my father's side, she didn't know much about my uncle João) had said that she had also dreamed about my uncle, and that the dream was strange, because she had seen my uncle being born again, and for some reason he was getting the vaccine all over again (the ones little babies get), in the end no one in the dream (only my boyfriend because he had seen my uncle) believed me that I had spoken to him, so I woke up here thinking that I was already awake.

I don't even know exactly how and where to start. I was never an extroverted person , but I had no difficulty being around lots of people or doing anything in public. At the beginning of 2024 I started developing some kind of fear/anxiety. For some reason whenever I got to a restaurant with my friends to eat , I couldn't eat . I thought it was just a one time issue but it persisted . I can eat outside alone, I can eat in a non crowded restaurant whenever I am just with myself or anywhere else but when I am with people , I just can't get the food down my throat. Even if its just a little piece of fries or anything, I can't eat with my friends around.

Another issue also appeared , sometimes when I am grocery shopping I feel shortness of breath and I feel mild heart pain , like im in some kinda fight or flight mode even tho there is no danger anywhere. For a while I thought this second issue was caused by consuming lots of caffeine , when I stopped drinking coffee completely, this issue subsided but its not 100% gone and some days it still appears.

I have no idea what caused this but it makes me feel bad that I can not have a good time with my friends and eating together because they think I don't wanna eat with them but I honestly just can't and I have no idea what triggered this for me.

1j5jqtu,https://www.reddit.com/r/loveafterporn/comments/1j5jqtu/our_wedding_anniversary_today/,Our wedding anniversary today,"
I woke up today knowing what day it was, our wedding anniversary. He woke up, hugged me, kissed me, then looked at my face and asked what was wrong. I told him. He forgot. He apologized and said he was just waking up, but honestly? I don’t even know how I feel about it.

To be fair, we never really celebrated it before. We were stuck in those zombie years, just existing next to each other. I had originally planned something for us but canceled. And yet, even though he forgot, I'm not as bothered as I thought I’d be. Maybe it’s because I feel like I’ve already given up in some way.

But today hit me in a different way. I realized that six years are down the drain. Every memory, every moment we shared, now feels tainted. I can’t look back at our wedding day, our trips, our little inside jokes without wondering what was real and what was just me believing in something that never truly existed. That’s the part that hurts the most. Not just the pain of betrayal, but the loss of time, the loss of something I thought was mine.

Still, he made coffee, talked to me, hugged me again, and told me he loves me more than anything. He said the letter I sent him yesterday really hit him, that he needs to protect me, that he finally understands. I heard the words. I just don’t know if I can feel them yet.

I might order something for myself today. A perfume maybe. I’ve been obsessed with them lately. Or a new pair of boots. I don’t feel like going out, don’t feel like celebrating. But I do feel like doing something just for me.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

**Response to Prompt 31: Epanalepsis**

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded exploration. As I embarked on this freewriting journey, the repetition of the existential inquiry became the rhythm of my introspection.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

I (26F) had a best friend (26F) who was essentially family to me. We have a history of friendship since high school and reconnected in university. When we stopped studying and being in each other’s space, our friendship definitely required more effort to maintain. But she was my person and I (thought) I was hers. 

We had healthy communication but possibly a little codependent as well. (Discovered this through my therapy sessions) 

When she had a mental breakdown I was there for her. Offered to secretly take (and pay) for therapy for her because her mom was against therapy and she didn’t have a medical plan that would cover it. I had money left from my bursary so I was in a position where I could help her with that. 
Through Covid we kept each other sane and focused on our studies. 

She always had insecurity issues so when she got her first boyfriend - was the first time I noticed the feeling of being a “placeholder”. And when they broke up we were back to being besties. And this the cycle continued when she got into her next relationship. In the midst of this relationship she had was when I had needed her to be a friend and support my like I had for her when she was at her lowest. I found out my mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer. And she was halfway across the world. I’m an only child so my friends were really my support system. I didn’t have many but I had few good ones. And during this time I just needed empathy. And support the way a friend would. Instead I was met with her not being able to help looking after my dog when I visited my mom for her surgery because “it’s Christmas holidays and my mom said I need to spend time with my family” type excuses. 
Throughout that year I asked if we could play some online games together now and then when I just needed some company or to talk. Come over for a movie. Anything. But there were just excuses after excuses. 
Finally we spoke about it. 
But there was no improvement. Finally the last straw hit when she couldn’t support me when I was traveling to my mother for her treatment. And it was just me asking if she wouldn’t mind being a backup if my friend looking after my dog couldn’t anymore or needed help. 

When I got back she tried to make plans to go for coffee. I declined and decided to just let the friendship die. I didn’t need a friend like that. 

I have been trying to get closure because this was my choice. At the time I chose not to speak about it because my words were not being heard. 

I bumped into her high school friend group and they said they don’t see her anymore. 

She breaks up with her boyfriend and suddenly she’s hanging out with them again. 

A mutual friend told me she said she doesn’t know what happened with us. 

And that for some reason triggered me. Because how can she not realise she was a bad friend? I expected better from her because one of her family friends dad passed away from cancer. So I thought she’d have some form of empathy because she knows firsthand how tough this can be. 

I realized that our friendship was good when she needed me. But when I needed her then she couldn’t step up. 

Do I finally say my say? Or is there no point. 

My goal isn’t to repair the friendship. ",1,1741339589.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I'm looking into buying a manual grinder mainly for espresso. After doing some research here, it seems like the Kingrinder K4 was one of the best options before it got discontinued. The K6 seems to be its replacement, but before the K4 was discontinued, many people agreed that K4 was better suited for dark roasts, which is what I mostly drink.

I'm currently using a cheap De'Longhi espresso machine (which was given to me as a gift) but am planning to buy something new in the coming months with a budget of €250. 

Another option I came across is the J-Max, which is supposed to be around €170, but after searching multiple times, the cheapest I found in the EU is around €230—which makes me question if it’s worth saving for.

# My preferences:

* Dark roasts
* Low acidity
* My current favorite coffee: Corica - Papua New Guinea

I'm still hesitant about the K6, since it might not be ideal for dark roasts. 

Would love to hear your thoughts! Any recommendations or feedback would be much appreciated.

With that being said, I feel like Seattle events and third places lack true connection connections with strangers and restaurants and cafes are becoming very lazy.


I also want to say that I’m still in college and I feel like there’s a lot of information about events that I don’t even know where to begin to start looking! I want to do more community outreach in volunteering, jazz, ceramics, woodworking (I’m part of the tool library), book clubs, open mics, comedy clubs, and more collaborative or art related markets. 


Most interactions I have out in town have people that are genuinely disinterested in communicating with and acknowledging other people’s’ existence. 
When I do stumble upon cool places that put on live events, it is mostly for people within their little niche. And most events are just friend group events. Like nobody is there alone. 

I have friends, but I am in the market for new experiences and friends in new communities, and want to really expand my community. The Seattle freeze just feels more and more real every year that goes by that I live here. 

Side note: Moving here definitely made me a coffee snob, but most coffee shops to me are oversaturated and use so much sugar and don’t pull proper artisanal espresso. Vivace and oxbow are the only consistent pull around here and I honestly don’t understand how much I’d rather have my own coffee at home than pay so much for a shitty coffee - there’s a difference between companies that really invest time into curation and the artistry. Same goes for food!!! Where’s the good food these days? 

LASTLY, I love the libraries. The city needs better facilities and accommodations for unhoused people. I love that the libraries can provide that, but how does Seattle not see this as an issue? Why are they not concerned about civic infrastructure expansion????

Any good study place ideas? Cafes, restaurants, co-ops, libraries, book stores, anything untraditional or underground? Looking to explore.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Doctor Andrew Scheele, Senior Researcher at the UN-VR Cooperative Institute of Integrative Xenobiology***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 27th, 2136*

Today was a very important day. For me, it was likely the most important one since I showed up on this planet. It was time for a small investment made in the past to finally begin paying itself off in stride. A momentous occasion, something to be celebrated for years to come.

Yes, today was the day that the coffee machine I ordered was expected to arrive at the facility.

It was for that reason that I rolled out of bed before my auto-blinds were open. I’d forgotten to change their timer with my alarm, but it did better at selling the fact that I’d woken up earlier than normal. Despite the change in scenery, my back still hurt.

I ate half a granola bar and took a shower. Aliens didn’t really care what I wore, but I still opted for a Hawaiian button-up shirt for the special occasion. It was all wrinkled, taken fresh from one of my two suitcases. My whole clothing area was kind of a mess, though I couldn’t find the motivation to clean it. In a similar sense, I lazily combed my longer-than-usual hair to the left and right. Morning yoga didn’t sound appealing, so I skipped it for the sixth day in a row.

I ate the other half of my granola bar as I headed out the door.

A short walk and a bus ride later, I arrived at a small shop called Perzel’s Arrangements. It was further away than I normally would’ve gone for some bread of all things, but it had a wider selection than anything else I’d looked at that was actually open to humans. Plus it had good reviews.

The door made a chime as I ducked through, and an airy voice called out to me, “Welcome! I’ll be out shortly!”

It felt a little like walking into a coffee shop. Quiet music played over the speakers, and glass counters displayed a variety of offerings, some of which looked familiar in that weird alien way. The place seemed welcoming enough, though the ceiling could stand to be a little higher for my comfort.

An unusually short Venlil emerged, and did her best to greet me. “O-Oh, a human. I-I mean, uh, *a human!* What, um… What c-can I help you with this paw?”

“I’ve got an order?” I said, hoping I wasn’t too intimidating. “For Andrew? I placed it online.”

“Andrew?” she squeaked. “One moment!” She disappeared behind a door.

Exactly one moment later, two Venlil came through the same door, each with a large (relative to them) box in their arms. They set them on the counter.

The second, taller Venlil looked up at me. “Here you are, Andrew. Is there anything else you may need?”

“Yeah, actually. Do you have sugar? I realized a little too late that I might need some.”

“…Raw sugar?” he asked. “Would a small container suffice?”

“That’ll work. You can add it to the current order.”

He turned to the shorter Venlil. “Would you be so kind?” While she rushed off, he ran a paw over the point-of-sale. “So, what’s the special occasion?”

“Coffee machine,” I said. “And I wanted some food. This place had good reviews, so I thought, why not?”

His ears wiggled. “We have good reviews for a reason, I can assure you! I’m certain you and your event-goers will thoroughly enjoy what you’ve selected.”

Perhaps if it was as good as he said, the other people arriving at the facility (at some point) might be interested in some Venlil cuisine. “Say, do you do catering?”

“We do, and we do not discriminate! And I should mention that I’d deliver it myself. We’re committed to excellent and personable customer service for all people.”

I raised an eyebrow from behind my mask. “Is your name Perzel, by chance?”

“The one and only!” He laughed, with just an edge of nervousness. “Perhaps the store’s name isn’t the most creative, but I hope it gets the point across.”

“Straightforward, I like it.”

The shorter Venlil emerged once more, carrying a small container. “Anything else we can help you with?”

I shook my head and complimented them both on excellent customer service, to which Perzel not-so-subtly asked me to recommend the place to anyone I knew. I headed out with my boxes of goodies.

I arrived at the facility much earlier than I expected. I stopped by the front counter to check if I had a package. The two receptionists seemed oddly reluctant to help me, a human, but at least they didn’t faint this time. Their whispers as I walked off made me wonder why they chose their job when the literal name of the facility had UN in it.

By the time I got upstairs and to the workroom, my arms were straining from the pile of boxes. By some miracle, the door was already open, and I dumped the three boxes onto the empty table near the front of the room.

I took a moment to stretch my arms and my back especially. *Ugh, maybe I should look into getting a back brace. Or maybe I shouldn’t have skipped yoga. I wonder if any chiropractors are on this planet. Or would they be as busy as the therapists?*

“Good morning, Andrew,” said a voice. Startled, I turned to see Celso. How I didn’t notice him, I had no idea.

“Hey,” I said, wrinkling my nose. “Are you early?”

“I am! I got here *just* before you did. I show up on time when no trains are involved.”

I faintly recalled something about a train when he showed up for his interview. “You live within walking distance? That’s a nice bonus.”

“It’s a little bit of a longer walk, but that just means I can appreciate the scenery.”

I nodded. “You want to try some coffee?”

He cocked an ear. “*Coffee*. It sounds like slime.”

I arched an eyebrow, grinning. “Interesting. I can assure you it’s anything but. A little bitter, maybe.” I set the boxes of food aside and ripped open the coffee machine box. “Have you ever had tea?”

“I used to have it all the time when I still lived on Leirn. We would always get the same kind; a little sweet, a little spicy, and fully delicious.”

“Something like cinnamon?” I said, wondering if that would translate.

He thought for a moment. “Sure, why not. The leaves come from this plant called a zifla. Smelly plant with an even smellier flower. It’s a tasty and expensive little snack, but you get more out of it by making tea.”

“You… You eat the plant?”

“Yeah! The flower is the best part, even if it’s rare that I ever got to eat one.”

“Huh. Neat. I’m not sure I would say the same about coffee… I’m guessing the plant smells so strongly that it acts as some kind of insect repellant?”

“That’s the strongest theory, I think. Didn’t stop us from munching on it.”

“Similar story to coffee, actually. Let me get us a few cups going. Oh, and I brought some breakfast, or at least what I’m calling breakfast. Have some, if you want.”

I grabbed the machine’s water tank and filled it up at the sink. That was one thing I did appreciate at this facility. Work rooms and break rooms (if you could even call them that) were separated only by a cozy little half-wall so you could still annoy your coworkers while you made a sandwich.

“Oh, you got this from Perzel’s Arrangements?” said Celso, looking at the two boxes. “Excellent choice, that place makes some great strayu.”

“You’ve had it before?” I asked, placing a packet of light roast coffee grounds into the machine and clicking it shut. “Maybe you can show me the proper cultural way of eating it.”

“You definitely don’t want advice from me. If it makes it into your mouth, that’s good enough.”

I laughed. “I meant in preparation. I went with their ‘classic arrangement’, which includes some jams and other stuff. Current plan is to spread it on a slice, but maybe that’s wrong.”

“Solid plan by my standards.” While I started a batch of coffee, Celso popped one of the boxes open. He placed two pre-cut slices of the stuff on a plate before reaching for the jam jars. His plate, once complete, looked a little emptier than mine would’ve.

“Feel free to take as much as you like. There’s plenty,” I emphasized.

“Oh, of course!” he said. “I might grab some more later.”

I nodded. The batch was done soon enough, and I grabbed two cups to pour some steaming hot coffee into. I missed having my own mugs with terrible science jokes on them. *I only drink CoFFe periodically*. That was one of my favorites.

I handed a cup to Celso, who’d taken a seat. “Have a taste. Might be hot.”

He took a cautious sip, then blinked a few times. “Is it supposed to be enjoyable?”

“To some.”

He stared at his cup, offended. “In that case, I have to wonder what tragic backstory they must have to willingly subject themselves to such a thing.”

I chuckled. “It’s an acquired taste! Though since you don’t appear to be immediately masochistic, toss in some sugar and coconut milk. That’s what I do.”

“Should I trust you a second time?”

I finished mixing my own, much lighter coffee. “If you don’t like it a second time, then… my condolences. I’ll look into this zifla plant and order some tea, or something.”

I prepared a plate of alien cuisine while Celso experimented with adding in amounts of milk and sugar and sampling the mixture. By the time I sat down, he appeared somewhat satisfied with his concoction.

I lifted my mask to take a sip from my cup. Something was missing. I wasn’t sure what. The alien bread stuff, on the other hand, was amazing. It was incredibly rich, and the jam only made it better. *Much* better than a bagel. I would probably be seeing Perzel again soon, assuming Su Hui would pay for catering.

I checked the time. It looked like Bemlin was late. He only had around ten minutes before his shift officially started, which made me wonder what was slowing him down.

“I don’t mean to be rude,” Celso interrupted my thoughts, “but do you usually wear a mask when you eat and drink?”

I opened and closed my mouth. “Uh, well, no. I’m just, uh, looking out for others’ comfort.”

“Hopefully not for mine. Or is your face *particularly* fearsome?”

I wasn’t sure whether to laugh or not. “I mean, uh, I sorta made some receptionists faint.”

“Is that a ‘yes’?” His ears wiggled, amused. “I bet I could handle it. I’ve had to look at much more fearsome things than a furless face.”

“Well, it’s not— Rather, I’m the only human here, and…” I struggled for the right words, but thankfully someone came to my rescue, whether he realized it or not.

Bemlin walked in. His eyes went from Celso to me. “Hello.”

“Bemlin! You want some coffee?” I was also about to ask him why he was so late when Rosim came in right behind him, likely being the answer. That guy seemed to have a knack for bothering people right when they showed up.

“Has your drug extraction device finally arrived?” Bemlin asked. “I have been somewhat curious about this beverage of yours.”

“It has!” I said, standing up. “Let me get you a cup.”

“Good paw, Doctor Scheele,” said Rosim. “I was hoping to meet you when you arrived, but it seems you were already here.”

“He found me instead,” Bemlin said, inspecting the coffee machine with a keen eye.

I frowned. “Did you want to talk about something?”

Rosim’s ears straightened. “Yes! I wanted to discuss what I mentioned in my email. I also did more searching after I went home last paw, and I realized I may have missed more than I first thought. Especially after that presentation, I believe it would be a huge mistake to not ask for any further insights humans could provide.”

“Rosim has been quite busy,” Bemlin added.

I scolded myself for neglecting his email beyond reading the subject line. Although I’d done the same for all the other emails asking me to talk about language models with them. “The association study. Of course. I’ll try and find some time. Lots to do.”

“Including showing me how to create a new line of plants,” Celso said, becoming a wingman I didn’t know I needed. “From what I’ve read, Earth plants seem a little more fussy than those on Venlil Prime.”

Rosim gave the Yotul a look I couldn’t decipher. “I suppose that sounds… important. But, uh, no problem at all, Doctor Scheele. Simply, er, send me a reply when you get a chance.”

“I will. As soon as I’m able.” I said, then gestured to the two boxes. “Care for a snack in the meantime?”

“Oh, no thank you. I’ll, um, leave you all be.” Rosim made his leave.

I turned my attention back to Bemlin. “Was he waiting in the lobby for you?”

“Indeed. You shouldn’t put off talking with him, I believe he has an important project that could benefit greatly from your input.”

“So does everyone else who emailed me after the presentation last paw,” I said, shaking my head. “I mean, work technically hasn’t even started yet. It’s not like I’m making him wait on purpose.”

Bemlin gave me a look I’d seen before. “When you meet with him, I’d like to join.”

“I’ll check his email soon. His, and the hundred others I’m sure are waiting for me.”

“Surely there cannot be that many. A short reply would be better than none.”

“It still takes time. I’m pretty sure almost every single person who saw it sent me an email regarding my presentation. That’s saying something, because I didn’t even put my email on screen. And that’s not even mentioning the random newsletters or the compliance reminders or the whatever else the UN emails me.”

“Your presentation was that good?” Celso interjected, half-eaten slice in paw. “Maybe I should’ve been there.”

I waved a hand. “It was *supposed* to be a super boring one. Then it took a turn because I am clearly not up to date.”

“He casually introduced revolutionary technology as though it were a simple calculator,” said Bemlin.

“It’s not— It should be common knowledge at this point,” I argued, then sighed. “Celso, you know the programmable sequence-specific DNA cutting protein that we’re using to knock out genes? That was engineered with the help of AI models.”

Celso’s eyes lit up. “Oh! Is that why it’s so thermally stable?”

“Among other things.” I grabbed a cup and filled it with coffee. “Here’s a coffee, Bemlin. If you drank whiskey, you might actually like it without anything else.”

The Gojid accepted the cup, and gave it a sniff. “Is this as light as your alcohol?”

I put my hand to my chest sarcastically. “I’m offended. One, maybe two cups is enough for a human, and I’d wager we’re on the more tolerant side if only because we generally have a higher body mass. Although I guess herbivores *would* be more resistant to the effects of plant toxins.”

Celso’s ears perked up. “Does that mean I can have another cup?”

“Go for it. But then there’s genetic factors that can impact the proteins involved in metabolism… Anyways, it’s not *light*, Bemlin. You’re drinking a pesticide that happens to bind to adenosine receptors.”

“I can safely ingest a wide variety of things,” the Gojid flatly replied. “You may be surprised.”

I laughed. “Yeah? Me too.”

His reply was lifting the cup to his mouth. Rather than taking a small sip, Bemlin opted for a generous mouthful on his very first go. He stared at his cup, contemplating.

“That was my reaction, too,” Celso said.

“It isn’t terrible,” the Gojid said. “I could see myself enjoying this.”

“…I spoke too soon.”

“Black coffee, then?” I asked. “You don’t want to add anything?” \\

Bemlin tapped a claw on the side of the cup. “Perhaps just a touch of salt to ease the bitterness slightly.”

“I only brought sugar.”

“Salt?” Celso said, incredulously.

“It does help,” I answered. “Tongues, and taste in general, are *very* interesting from a biochemical and neurological standpoint. Signals sent from the tongue can interfere with each other, even though you’re still tasting the exact same thing.”

Bemlin turned to the two food boxes. “You purchased upmarket food for this? Is that a prerequisite for enjoying coffee?”

“Coffee is an anytime thing,” I said. “I was just in the mood for bagels, but—would you believe it—no places popped up when I searched for them. Alien bread is the next best thing. And it wasn’t *that* expensive.”

“An ‘anytime thing’, you say. Is every human I see afflicted with stimulants?”

“You say that like it’s a bad thing.”

“So I am correct.”

I waved a dismissive hand. “Statistically, it’s not unlikely.”

“Thank you for sharing,” Celso abruptly said, standing up. “Though I should probably see to the calluses. The other two are coming soon, right? I wouldn’t want to crowd up the area.” He put away his empty (already?) cup and plate.

“You sure you don’t want any more? There’s plenty.”

“I’ll be sure to grab some more later. Thanks, though!”

I frowned, suspecting there was perhaps more to his reasoning. He hadn’t officially met Acetli nor Tanerik, which may have fueled my suspicions. “Alright, well… I’ll meet you over there at some point this claw. Right after I reply to a few emails.”

He laughed. “No rush; I know what I’m doing with the gene gun this time around!”

As Celso made his exit, Bemlin picked out a few slices and jams. “I believe I may do the same. Although I have the privilege of being able to snack while I work.”

I stared at my own slice I’d only taken three bites out of. “Yeah… I’ll be in my office for a bit. Mind shooting me a message once Acetli or Tanerik arrive?”

“I will promptly inform you.”

I grabbed my meal and headed to my office. After shutting the door and flicking on my Christmas lights, I took off my mask and adjusted my chair to keep my back as straight as possible. I logged into my computer, determined to crank through emails as quickly as I could—exactly what coffee was good for.

One day, I decided to start a business that no one expected. I didn’t open a coffee shop or a clothing store—I opened a **poison shop!** Yes, a store specializing in selling legal poisons for pest control. At first, things were rough. Customers were rare, and losses piled up. I was on the verge of shutting down, thinking I had made the worst decision of my life.

# The Losses and the Unexpected Twist

As time passed, I realized that people were searching for high-quality poisons but didn’t trust just any random shop. So, I changed my strategy, focusing on rare, highly effective products while providing detailed information about their use.

# The Sudden Success and Becoming a Millionaire

It didn’t take long before the demand skyrocketed. Orders started flooding in from everywhere, and my profits grew beyond anything I had imagined. In a short time, my small business transformed into a **massive success**, and I found myself living a life I had never dreamed of!

1j5jg4h,https://i.redd.it/b3vcdolgi8ne1.jpeg,Journey so far from a Male 39 6ft,"So I started on 1st January 

I've always been chubby since a baby. My general fitness is good. I don't smoke or drink. I've always struggled like others with getting weight down.  I cycle and spinning in my spare time do go to the gym and be active everyday. 

3 months in and a few normal known side effects with number 2 and gut which we all know about is good. I've also started doing more clean home cooked meals but being very selective what I eat.  I do eat mainly a fish and Mediterranean type foods. Have a steak every so often with sweet potato and some avocado and minimal dressing. The diet can get boring very quickly but we are doing this to detox the body and be a healthier person and learn from this when we come off it. 

Id say the biggest thing to do this isn't taking the injection it's really the willpower, attitude towards healthy eating discipline to yourself and control. 

The obvious science without injection is burn more calories that you consume. Since on it I know you need massive up your intake of fibre and hydration either that be with good fibres and electrolytes. 

The cravings have stopped but do come back after the end of the week cycle even with 5mg. The injection starts straight away. I've been injecting into my stomach left and right sides rotating this. I did notice that when I was on the lowest dose my cycle was Wednesday evening to Wednesday and on the Sunday to Tuesday I noticed it was creeping away the temptations. 

You do have to keep focused on the weight loss journey but to get the most potential from this you need to be active I've found. The motivation may not be there for some and they are happy to keep the diet clean and easy but you do need to some some physical exercise. 

People say how's your energy levels been since being on it. I personally would say it's been the same. My body clock for work is still set. I wouldn't so im wiped out each day. I am having less meals or cals intake also less coffees and snaking on healthier substitutes like apples or fruit. Portions and managing have greatly reduced. I would normally be able to finish meals but now I regularly get fuller quicker. I wouldnt say im a good piler but I eat normal portions for one but can easily tap out and say im with unfinish food on my plate. I've uploaded my journey so far. I would say that Mounjaro has really changed the way I think of food of course I still am a foodie and love the flavours and still go out and treat myself to good food. Either Sushi or Ramen or a bowl of Pho. I can't eat takeaway anymore I feel like crap and kind of ill after it. Chinese and Indian Takeaway can't do it. 

When I shop for me personally I try to keep to items which are more organic and natural products but also high protein yogurts like Fage or similar. Drink more guy healthier products. Taking a greens powder to get greens in and water. So im doing Reheal Gut Health. Supplements I take Vitamin D, Apple Cider Vinegar for Sulphur Burps. There are plenty of multi vitamins out there. 

Im selective about what I eat and of course there are sometimes cheat days but my appetite or the need of food had significantly changed. Going to the food market to buy stuff is selective only. Buying more leafy greens broccoli and veg. Bread occasionally I have with toast but it's reduced. If I have bread I try to keep to a sour dough. 

All I can say is it helps and it works but you need to self discipline yourself and not just rely on the injection become the best healthier version of you whilst on this to give you that boost.

Women have expressed interest in me + I’ve had past relationships but they were all long distance. Which means I’ve never gotten to take a woman out for dinner or coffee. Here’s the kicker tho, every time I tell someone that I’ve never been on a date, I get a variation of “no way” or “you’re lying” or “how?”. 


Getting these types of reactions means that I am good looking to an extent I guess, but it hasn’t translated to any dates. I will admit tho, I am a late bloomer, I was bullied mercilessly as a child, was fat then skinny and now I’m in the middle which is nice.


I know I need to put myself out there more but every time I do so I get burned rather quickly, in spectacular fashion I may add. I’m also afraid of rejection which doesn’t help. My luck isn’t the best either, and considering how unavailable people in my city are, I guess it makes sense. I just feel so far behind my peers, I feel weird.


I get everyone has their own timeline but at the same time, when most people your age are in committed relationships or going out on dates, it’s hard not to feel unloved/unwanted in addition to feeling like you’re behind.


I also wonder if I should ever tell a woman this when (not if) the day comes? Will she be turned off? Will she be weirded out and think to herself “what’s wrong with this guy? How has he never been on a date?”

I'm soooooo deep in the rabbit hole. #sigh

I've been a home barista for 1.5 years, enjoying many wonderful beans. Started off with a J-Max and a Lelit Victoria. I learned a hell of a lot of things required to make a decent shot at home. Mine was all the fun and frustration you all can imagine. Since then I've upgraded to the K-Ultra (exclusively for filters) and a DG64V with SSP MP. Oh boy, what a difference that's made!

Fast forward to the recent weeks: I finished a pro barista training and suddenly something has changed. I started to miss that thick, coherent, heavy kind of shots we've pulled with the Sanremo/Mahlkönig E80S, so I thought ""hey, let's just push the little Victoria harder"": I soft-modded the PID (for better temperature stability), changed to the same Loveramics cups, pre-heated them, perfected my puck prep and STILL I miss that thick, heavily textured espresso. All the taste notes are there, sweet, balanced, but ""light"". I can't express it better. Regardless of the same beans, ground with the same Mahlkönig.

I understand that it is just physically impossible to get the same quality from my Victoria, so I'm looking for a meaningful upgrade that can up my game at home.

Now, since the Bianca costs 4 times the Victoria (I'm living in the EU), I'm wondering if this would make any sense as I can pull a shot in the bar any time I want. But that's a different environment where I look differently at the coffee.

Now I realized that this was mostly a ventilation exercise I put here so please forgive me. :D Please tell your story of upgraditis! :D",1,1741338293.0,espresso,5,0.67,False

Moving cut off all my old social networks so it is what it is gotta try to rebuild now I feel settled.

I've looked about on other places and here and seen some of the local events, discords/meet ups in place and I've explored those and just didn't enjoy the casual group of strangers nature of it all; it felt very disconnected and almost forced; not to mention having been harassed at one; So i'm just kinda steering away from it.
 
My life style leaves me with free time during the daytime office hours; and that also makes the above groups less accessable to me; I also don't drink, and don't have Saturdays free... So I'm poking in all other corners of the net and reaching out to anyone! Even you shy peeps that might be hiding in more anonymous places like reddit, i'll bring anyone outta their shell ! 

I have no crazy requirements or anything; ideally, you're like me age range wise, pretty direct with their communication, fancy coffee/lunch during the week sometimes and have a genuine interest in making a new friend - everyone is welcome, single mums and dads, couples, people that only relate to one of my interests. whatever ! and if we don't click, that's cool no biggie ! but I love to meet EVERYONE to find who I do gel with :D

I am always listening to music and finding new stuff! most genres work for me, if it's good, I listen to it, not musically talented mind you

I like nails and fashion; cooking and baking, cleaning and tidying. food ! and exploring little areas around Norfolk, the beach is great too ! I play video games a little and the usual human stuff like breathing, youtubing, films etc ! Theres more to me but this post is long enough !

Week 3 on 60mg.

I really felt the difference day one of week 1 and the same again on the first day of week 2.
At the start of week 3 not much change.

That said, it's doing me a world of good.

I feel like the background noise in my head is way quieter and more easily manageable.

I can still hyper-focus and get my work done without the adrenaline and fear/dread/stress driving me.

The physical tension in my neck, back and shoulders is a lot less.

I'm sleeping better. 

I'm snacking a lot less, I used to eat a lot of sugary foods to chase the dopamine rush. I no longer feel the need anymore.

I'm more confident because the background noise always telling me I'm awful is easier to ignore and manage.

There some downsides though:

Coffee makes me more anxious and tense.

Coffee and intense exercise and hour after taking it gave me really bad heart palpitations. So that was a mistake.

Some friends and family have said that I'm a more irritable but I think this is due to the newfound confidence and not tolerating certain behaviours anymore.

TL;DR

March 6, 2025

Indian tiktoker/streamer ShaktyG set up his professional streaming equipment in a local coffee shop Bricks & Brew despite the shops policy regarding professional shooting/streaming which was posted upon the entrance of the premises and on their counter.

The influencer, security guard and administration management got into a heated argument as the influencer refused to acknowledge the compound's policy.

Later that night on his tiktok and Kick live stream, ShaktyG discussed what he experienced and accused the staffs of being aggressive, racist, and ungrateful through fabricated lies and posted continuous questions of why he wasn’t allowed to do his live streaming. He even mentioned that the shop should be “thankful as they needed him to make the shop viral” and “what he did was actually free promotions for the store”. The shop were also targeted by his followers on his live, on Google, and on Facebook with negative reviews even if they haven’t visited the shop yet, and even propagating hate through tagging the shop as the, “racist cafe”.

This desire grew when I was about 10-13, because I’d listen to Avicii’s music. I found comfort in a lot of his music, and it felt like it spoke directly to me. ‘Live a life you will remember’ is a lyric I’ve thought about every day for the last 10+ years. 

I’ve worked ever since I was 16, and have been in finance since I was 18 years old and I’ve hated every second of it. Good money, but awful work / life balance. 

The funny thing is until 2 days ago I had been in a month long process for interviewing for a new job. Even better pay, less hours, but doing something I know I won’t enjoy. 

During my first interview, which was an informal chat in a coffee shop, I was chatting with the interviewer when I noticed that The Nights started playing in the cafe. And then I heard that lyric. And then I wondered if it was a sign, but I brushed it off. 

Fast forward 4 weeks to the final interview, which also happened to be in a different coffee shop with someone else. I knew if this went well I’d have a good chance of being offered the job. But the same thing happened, we were chatting and then The Nights started playing on the radio. In my head, this wasn’t a coincidence. This had to be a sign. 

So as scary as it was, 2 days ago I emailed the company to say thank you but I’m withdrawing my candidacy. That same night, I booked a one way ticket to Nepal at the end of the year. I plan on leaving home for at least a year, hopefully longer if I can help it. 

I’m so glad that I was reminded that money isn’t everything and that actually enjoying life is. So thanks to Tim, at the end of the year I’m going to fulfill my dream. 

I can’t wait to live a life I’m gonna remember

1j5iztc,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1j5iztc/second_trip_to_japan_could_use_some_tips/,"Second trip to Japan, could use some tips!","Hi guys

In 4 weeks I'm leaving for Japan for the second time. I'll be there for 3-4 weeks.

My first trip was also 3 weeks and involved visiting Tokyo (+Yokohama), Takayama, Kyoto (+ Nara) and a temple stay on Mount Koya.

As you can see from my first trip's limited itinerary, I'm a slow traveler. I like just walking, especially in nature, and onsen. Maybe that's why my best memories are from Takayama haha. I like to visit the occasional shrine or temple but much more, I like just breathing in the atmosphere and drinking a coffee.

So for my second trip, I was thinking of staying a couple of days in Tokyo, taking it slow, walking around a bit, see a band play in Shimokita, shed off the jetlag. I would then go in the direction of Osaka and then go to Hiroshima.   
  
Afterwards, I was thinking of making my way to Kyushu? As in, take the shinkansen to Fukuoka. And then spend my time doing day trips from Fukuoka, maybe visit some of the smaller cities and towns around it.

What I could use some help with:

Is it worth it to go to Kyushu if I'm only there for 3 weeks? My thoughts were that it might be a little less touristic and more authentic? But then again, Honshu probably also has enough of this to offer if I do a bit more research. 

More specifically, I'm also not sure if Osaka is worth it? I love Tokyo but I didn't really like Kyoto since it was so packed with tourists that I just stayed in the hostel during the day haha.

Essentially, I'm trying to find the experience I had in Takayama, calm atmosphere, onsen, accessible nature, without going back to Takayama. Maybe even more off the beaten path! So if you know of any towns/cities that match this description, do let me know!

Thanks for the help!

1j5ir6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/RepTime/comments/1j5ir6y/dear_real_watch_wearers_and_repilluminati/,"Dear ""Real Watch Wearers"" and Rep-illuminati,","First off, let me clarify something for all you doubters and basement-dwelling keyboard warriors: I, too, am part of the elite. Not like your cousin’s cousin who “knows a guy,” but a real collector. My collection isn’t just about Rolex, okay? I have a Seiko 5 I keep for sentimental reasons (birth of my dog), a Casio F-91W (because not every day is a flex day), and, of course, my prized possession: an Omega Speedmaster “FOIS” (For Only Incredible Snobs). But I digress.

Yesterday, as a TRUE horologist, I had my own brush with the filth of repdom. Picture this: I’m at my favorite spot—Starbucks Reserve. A place where I can sip my overly complicated $15 coffee while casually flashing my 116610LN (yes, box, papers, receipt, and yes, I laminated it for safekeeping). It’s not about showing off; it’s about living authentically.

As I lift my cup to take a sip (naturally adjusting my cuff for the perfect lighting angle), some dude wearing Yeezys (probably reps too) and a hoodie with an anime catgirl on it says, “Nice Sub, bro. Is that a Clean Factory?” I nearly dropped my macchiato. “Excuse me?” I asked, utterly aghast.

“Clean Factory,” he repeated, as if I’d just asked him where the nearest hot topic was. “You know, ZZF? CF? Bro, don’t worry, reps are basically 1:1 now. Nobody can tell. And if your rehaut’s off-center, I know a guy who can fix it for $30.”

$30.

THIRTY DOLLARS.

I was absolutely fuming. My entire body was shaking like the balance wheel in a 4Hz movement. I’ve spent years building my relationship with my AD, buying random cufflinks and tie bars I’ll never wear, attending boutique “events” where we sip room-temperature champagne and clap politely as some dude talks about “heritage,” just to EARN my place in this sacred hobby. And this man—this… rep-degenerate—had the audacity to compare my authentic grail piece to his $500 Frankenwatch.

But it gets worse.

This guy then leans in closer—uncomfortably close—and says, “It’s all good, bro. No need to front. I’ve got a Franken Daytona, too. Looks so real, even Rolex wouldn’t know. Wanna see?”

No, I do not wanna see your disgusting, sin-filled, glue-ridden, abomination of a Frankenwatch. But before I could respond, he whipped it out (the watch, not… you know) and started explaining the finer details of “gen vs. rep.” He said “gen” like it was a flex, as if owning a real watch was some kind of “optional bonus” in the rep world. He even laughed, saying, “Honestly, you’re dumb if you’re paying retail.”

Retail? Retail??

Does he not understand the sacrifice that goes into paying retail? The years of begging an AD to acknowledge my existence? The sleepless nights wondering if I should just buy the diamond bezel Datejust to move up the waitlist? This isn’t just a watch. It’s a lifestyle. A lifestyle he could never understand from his parents' basement.

So here’s my open letter to the “rep” community:

1. STOP assuming every nice watch is a rep. Some of us actually work for this. (And by “work,” I mean strategically purchasing useless jewelry to curry favor with sales reps. You wouldn’t get it.)


2. STOP flexing your fake garbage like it’s some kind of life hack. You’re not a genius because you saved money; you’re a fraud. Enjoy your fraudulent little world where your Submariner's lume lasts two hours and smells faintly of superglue.


3. GET A REAL WATCH. Maybe then you’ll understand the joy of spending years and thousands of dollars to prove you’re worthy of owning something.



To the guy in Starbucks: I hope your anime hoodie catches on fire the next time you lean over the espresso machine.

Yours with lume that lasts all night,
A real collector who doesn’t need to buy friends with shiny objects (but still does).",22,1741335679.0,RepTime,14,0.84,False

I’m launching a new coffee brand (not a cafe) and want to create something that appeals to *both* coffee enthusiasts and people who haven’t yet fallen in love with coffee. Whether you’re a 4 cups  a day guy (like me) or someone who’s never liked coffee, please feel free to share your opinion .

**For Coffee Drinkers:**

1. What’s your go-to coffee? (e.g., cold brew, flat, pour-over, espresso, americano etc.)
2. What makes a cup of coffee “perfect” for you? (e.g., bold flavor, smoothness, ethical sourcing, convenience, etc.)
3. What’s a fair price for a 250gm bag of high-quality coffee? (Be honest-no judgment!)
4. What’s missing in current coffee brands? (e.g., sustainable packaging, unique flavors, subscription options, instant coffee option,  etc.)
5. Which coffee origin, within Nepalese border do you prefer? (e.g., Kavre, Lamjung, Gulmi, taplejung, etc.)

**For Non-Coffee Drinkers:**

1. What would make you try coffee? (e.g., less bitterness, caffeine-free options, health perks, dessert-like flavors, etc.)
2. would you like to find your taste? like in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-iNAyu-ejo&t=1s), where Tom Scott tries coffee with James Hoffmann

1j5ipxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1j5ipxg/had_a_falling_out_with_two_coworkers_now_theyre/,"Had a falling out with two coworkers, now they're making my job difficult.","Context: Myself (24F), my mother (47F), my coworker (25F) who I'll give the name Bailey, and her mother (47F), who I'll call Gertrude, have all worked at the same company for just over 2 years. My mom, Gertrude, and myself are all supervisors at the place we work, Bailey is just a houskeeper. We all started off as houskeepers though, and the 3 of us were recently promoted. 

I considered them both to be good friends of mine, Bailey especially. Bailey and I were super close, we shared everything, had similar music taste, enjoyed the same tv shows, food, everything. We just really hit it off and we both relied on eachother quite a bit outside of work. We went on a lot of fun trips together and spent the night at eachothers places regularly. I didnt inted on befriending her mom initially, she kind of just forced herself into our friendship. She always had to go where we were, talk about the shit Bailey and I were up to, invite herself to our outings  etc. She did end up growing on me eventually, though she has always still made me feel a little uncomfortable. I looked past it though, and remained friendly towards Gertrude.

My mom had never liked Gertrude but was civil because we all worked together, she did support my friendship with Bailey though. Things recently went sour between us, Gertrude and Bailey, and it caused me to question my morals and forced me to make some really hard decisions.

A few months ago Gertrude and I were celebrating another coworkers birthday and were dropping her off at home. We have staff housing, 3 tiny homes, one of which was hers and her neighbor was one of our other supervisors Jason(30M). Gertrude and this other coworker had massive crushes on Jason. He was supposedly leaving for a camping trip that afternoon and while we were dropping our buddy off they noticed his window was wide open. Gertrude joked about breaking into his home to see how he kept his home, and the other girl who I'll call Margo(18F) took her seriously. They then actually broke into his home by prying off his screen and crawling in. 

I stayed outside and was extremely uncomfortable. They kept joking about how I was the watchman but honestly I just didn't want to be involved and Gertrude was our ride so I couldn't leave. I was panicked, and to make things worse Jason came back to his home WHILE THEY WERE INSIDE??? I yelled at them to get out and they did, he miraculously did not notice anything... or hasn't mentioned it at least, I'm not sure. 

This was the first instance where I seriously questioned my relationship with Gertrude. She has always made gross comments about Jason, often got too touchy with him when we went out drinking, which I discouraged... but breaking into his home was on a completely whole other level. 

I temporarily cut contact with her and Bailey for a few days after this, and I explained how disappointing their behavior was to me and that I didn't want to surround myself with people who's values didn't align with my own. The reson I cut Bailey out too was because of something that has been an issue between is that came to a point the week prior. I am asexual, Bailey is the complete opposite. Which is great, I support her. But she would often step over my boundaries and frequently pushed me into uncomfortable sexually charged situations, which I'll admit I was too shy to speak up about, but I though I'd made it very clear I had no interest in sexual stuff. She also undermined me constantly at work and had the impression that Id let her get away with things the other houskeepers wouldnt. That combined with her mother breaking into one of our coworkers homes pushed me over the edge and I blocked them out. 

After I had a moment to think, I had two private but separate sit-downs with them outside of work. They were heartfelt conversations where I gave them a 2nd chance. I reiterated what my boundaries were and what I expected out of the people I have in my life. Especially with Gertrude. I had been honest in telling her that the only reason I hadn't filed a police report was because she was Baileys mom. I made sure they understood that when it came down to it, I would do what was necessary for my health and that them asking me to pick between them and my job was asking me to pick them over myself. 

Skip a few months down the line, my relationship with  Bailey never made a full recovery. It wasn't unfriendly, we just didn't really chat or hang out anymore, which admittedly was on me. Bailey said she'd wait for me to be comfortable but I just never felt the same. Gertrude bounced back immediately, but it was also fairly one-sided. I didn't really want to re-connect with her but I knew Bailey would be unwilling to talk to me if her mom wasn't involved. 

It gets messy again when Gertrude, Bailey, and myself are added into a small group chat with another coworker, this coworker started it to share pics of her new puppy with us, which is great! But the next day Gertrude sends an unsolicited photo to the group of a different houskeeper bent over with her buttcrack exposed in a vulnerable position. This happened on company time on company property. Gertrude sent it with a demeaning comment mocking her. I was beyond livid. Keep in mind Gertrude is seen as the ""work mom"" and is in a part of our management team. 

I sent a screenshot to my mom asking what to do because I wasn't at work to report it, but i fealt that our Manager needed to know what had happened asap. She took it to our manager for me and Gertrude was let go the following morning. After her firing she sent out mass texts to all our staff apologizing and owning up, which caused a lot of unnecessary drama to be stirred up, and has continued messaging my coworkers to this day questioning them about what shit we are talking about her. It has made a couple of my coworkers very uncomfortable. 

We have done nothing but make a statement that she and the company have parted ways. The rest of our management team thought it would be best to nip it in the bud so no more rumors spread. Bailey refuses to acknowledge me in any form, when i speak to her she looks through me or pretends she doesn't hear me. She weirdly keeps sucking up to my mom, and I get the impression she is trying to drive a wedge between my mom and I. 

Another reason I get that feeling is that Gertrude has been making handmade coffees and sending them in with Bailey to everyone(Gertrude brought in homemade coffees frequently as a treat before her termination) but myself. She actually put my old coffee cup (theyre personalized stabucks cups that they got our group as gifts) on the breakroom table with someone elses name on it, which felt like an intentional jab.Gertrude even privately messaged my mom saying she will be getting one tomorrow. And I don't mean to sound jealous, I do not want a coffee, but this is an example of all the small ways Bailey and Gertrude have been trying to publicly embarrass or exclude me while we are at work. 

I have been very fair to Bailey and have given her many opportunities to come to me like a normal person. She is a separate employee from her mom and I don't expect her to be my best friend, but I do expect her to respond to me at work and hold a work-related conversation with me while we are working because I am one of her supervisors and it is vital to both of our jobs that we communicate. I do not blame her for the actions of her mom, but I am losing my patience with her constant jabs and dismissive behavior. I want to convey to her that I don't want there to be an issue between us at work, but I can't seem to break through. 

I think Bailey's treatment of me is unfair and not deserved. I understand she sees me as the reason her mom was fired, and I am, but i had made it clear to them that i will not tokerate this treatment of people and i will chose my job over them if it comes to it. Gertrude had the option to not send that photo, but she sent it anyway. After Gertrude was let go i pushed our Manager to sit down with Hailey and reassure her that her moms actions didnt reflect her, and that she was still welcome to work her as she had done nothing wrong. I have gone lengths to make sure the other houskeepers arent pestering her about her mom, that rumors are not being spread, and I gave her plenty of sapce because i also understand the she is loyal to her mother. Its been a month now and her bahavior is getting worse, its time for her to step up and do her job. Im trying to be patient, but i am no longer willing to let her walk all over me and belittle me in front of my colleagues.

I’m starting a **social experiment** designed to bring people together in community spaces —**cafés, restaurants, art venues, etc.—without the distraction of phones.** The idea is simple: **check your phone at the door, be fully present, and enjoy real connections.** It’s an effort to create more mindful social spaces and bring awareness to just how embedded tech is in our lives and create more spaces without it. This concept is taking off in Europe, and I’d love to see it grow here in the U.S. as well.

If all goes well, I’d love to make this a regular thing. I’m hosting **two meetups in the next seven days** (with more planned in the coming months), and seeking likeminded people!
