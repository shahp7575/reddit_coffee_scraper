1j6hstj,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1j6hstj/random_struggling_with_the_sagebreville_barista/,[RANDOM] Struggling with the Sage/Breville Barista Touch Impress? Here’s What Worked for Me,"Hi everyone,

I've seen a lot of posts from people frustrated with their Touch Impress, either struggling to get a proper espresso or just not enjoying the experience. I was in the same boat for the first couple of weeks. Before this, I had experience with the Touch (classic/simple version - a friend was owning one), and now I own a Touch Impress. Initially, I couldn't get consistent extractions - aiming for a 14g basket, 2:1 ratio, and 30s extraction.

So, I started experimenting with different accessories and techniques.

Before diving into accessories, two key factors massively impact the espresso quality:

1) Fresh, quality beans - I avoid beans roasted more than 1.5 months ago and stick to medium roasts.
2) Impress lever pressure - The force applied when pressing the tamping lever is critical for consistent extraction.


In terms of accesories, here’s what I use now and why:

- Bottomless Portafilter (Crema Coffee) - Helps diagnose extraction issues (uneven flow, channeling, etc.). Tested initially the botomless portafilter from Normcore, I do not recommend it at all for the Impress version.
- IMS Competition Basket (B62 52T H24 E) - Instantly improved extraction quality.
- Magnetic Coffee Funnel (Normcore) - Reduces mess and allows proper distribution techniques.
- Puck Screen (Crema Coffee, 1.7mm) - Greatly improves water dispersion across the puck.
- Distributor Tool - Started with Crema Coffee's, then switched to a similar one. Levels the coffee bed evenly.
- WDT Tool (Normcore V3) - Breaks up clumps and ensures even distribution before tamping.

How I use these accessories:
- Grind the coffee & tamp once with the Impress lever (so I know there is enough coffee in the basket)
- Remove the portafilter, place the magnetic funnel on top, and use the WDT tool to declump & distribute.
- Use the distributor to level the coffee bed and lightly tamp.
- Reinsert into the Impress mechanism, tamp twice more. Here is when the force matters.
- Remove the portafilter again, place the puck screen on top.
- Extract espresso.

With these tweaks, I now consistently get 27-33s extractions about 80-90% of the time. Changing beans requires some adjustment shots, but once dialed in, the process is smooth.

Yes, these accessories add to the overall cost, and that might not be for everyone. But for me, I wanted a balance between automation and manual espresso making, and the Touch Impress, once optimized, was the perfect fit.

Hope this helps someone looking to make the most of their Impress instead of returning it. Let me know if you have any questions or if you think I missed anything.

1j6hrt0,https://i.redd.it/mjxismym2hne1.jpeg,Aiden Poor Drainage / Descale needed?,"I am getting a lot of water in the brew chamber still after the samo bloom profile that has been shared a lot on this thread for 600mL of brewed coffee. I am using the same grind setting, a 5 on Ode Gen 1, as I have used before with this profile and have gotten incredible results. But recently without changing anything including the beans, I’ve noticed quite a bit of water still left to drain through and it usually takes about 2-3 full minutes after the end of the profile brewing time. Can this be an indicator the machine needs to be descaled? I don’t have a full appreciation for the component parts and what mineral build up can do. I know I could just grind finer but again, for many months I had gotten great consistent results and now recently without changing anything all this water still backed up. For what it’s worth( I haven’t gotten the add water error message yet and I’ve had the machine since early January, so about 3 months with regular usage 1-2 times a day. Thanks!

The exact amount depends on the type and quantity of milk and sugar used. Coffee is a popular morning beverage for many. But if you add milk and sugar, it can affect your daily calorie intake. Understanding how many calories are in your coffee can help you make better dietary choices.

This blog post will break down the calorie content of coffee with milk and sugar. We will discuss different types of milk and how various amounts of sugar can change the calorie count. By the end, you’ll know exactly what you’re consuming in your favorite cup of coffee.

# Caloric Basics

Understanding the calories in your coffee with milk and sugar can help you make healthier choices. Let’s break down the caloric basics to get a clearer picture of what you’re consuming with each cup.

# What Are Calories?

Calories are units of energy. They measure the energy food and drinks provide to our bodies. In simple terms, calories keep us alive by fueling our daily activities.

Here are some key points about calories:

* Calories come from three main macronutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.
* Each gram of carbohydrate or protein provides 4 calories.
* Each gram of fat provides 9 calories.

Let’s look at coffee with milk and sugar. A standard 8-ounce cup of black coffee has only about 2 calories. Adding milk and sugar increases the calorie count.

|Ingredient|Calories|
|:-|:-|
|Black Coffee (8 oz)|2|
|1 tablespoon of milk|9|
|1 teaspoon of sugar|16|

So, a cup of coffee with one tablespoon of milk and one teaspoon of sugar has about 27 calories. These extra calories can add up quickly if you drink multiple cups a day.

# Why Calories Matter

Calories matter because they are directly linked to our energy balance. Consuming more calories than we burn leads to weight gain. On the other hand, consuming fewer calories than we burn leads to weight loss.

Here are some reasons why monitoring calorie intake is important:

* **Weight Management:** To maintain, lose, or gain weight, you need to manage your calorie intake.
* **Energy Levels:** Proper calorie intake ensures you have enough energy for daily activities.
* **Nutritional Balance:** Balancing calories helps you consume essential nutrients without overeating.

Consider your daily coffee habit. If you drink three cups of coffee with milk and sugar each day, you consume an extra 81 calories. Over a month, this adds up to about 2,430 extra calories.

**Small changes in your coffee habits can make a big difference.** Switching to black coffee or using low-calorie sweeteners can reduce your calorie intake significantly.

Remember, understanding and managing your calorie intake can help you achieve a healthier lifestyle.

# Coffee Types

Coffee is enjoyed worldwide in countless variations. The calories in coffee can change based on the type of coffee and added ingredients. In this blog post, we will explore the calorie content of different coffee types. Let’s dive into black coffee and espresso variants to understand their calorie counts better.

# Black Coffee

Black coffee is one of the simplest forms of coffee. It is made by brewing ground coffee beans with hot water. This type of coffee contains zero calories, assuming no sugar or milk is added. Here are some key points about black coffee:

* **Calories**: 0 per 8 oz cup
* **Ingredients**: Just coffee and water
* **Benefits**: Rich in antioxidants, improves alertness

If you add sugar or milk, the calorie count will increase. For example, adding one teaspoon of sugar (4 grams) adds about 16 calories. Adding one tablespoon of whole milk (15 ml) adds about 9 calories. Here’s how the calories add up:

|Ingredient|Quantity|Calories|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Black Coffee|8 oz|0|
|Sugar|1 tsp|16|
|Whole Milk|1 tbsp|9|

Therefore, a typical cup of black coffee with one teaspoon of sugar and one tablespoon of milk will contain about 25 calories. This is still relatively low compared to other beverages.

# Espresso Variants

Espresso is a concentrated form of coffee. It is made by forcing hot water through finely-ground coffee beans. A single shot of espresso (1 oz) contains about 3 calories. There are many espresso-based drinks, and their calorie content varies:

* **Espresso (1 oz)**: 3 calories
* **Americano**: Espresso with hot water, similar to black coffee, about 3 calories per 8 oz
* **Latte**: Espresso with steamed milk, about 150 calories per 8 oz
* **Cappuccino**: Espresso with steamed milk and foam, about 80 calories per 8 oz
* **Macchiato**: Espresso with a small amount of milk, about 20 calories per 2 oz

Here’s a table for a clearer picture:

|Drink|Quantity|Calories|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Espresso|1 oz|3|
|Americano|8 oz|3|
|Latte|8 oz|150|
|Cappuccino|8 oz|80|
|Macchiato|2 oz|20|

Espresso-based drinks can vary greatly in calorie content. Adding syrups, whipped cream, or other flavorings will also increase the calories. Always check the ingredients to manage your calorie intake effectively.

# Milk Options

When thinking about how many calories are in your coffee with milk and sugar, the type of milk you use plays a huge role. Different milk options can change the calorie count significantly. Let’s explore some popular milk choices and see how they impact the calories in your coffee.

# Whole Milk

Whole milk is a popular choice for coffee lovers. It adds a rich, creamy texture to your coffee. But, it also adds more calories.

Here’s a quick look at the calories in coffee with whole milk:

|Ingredient|Calories|
|:-|:-|
|1 cup of black coffee|2|
|1 tablespoon of whole milk|9|
|1 teaspoon of sugar|16|

So, if you add 2 tablespoons of whole milk and 1 teaspoon of sugar to your coffee, you are looking at about 36 calories. This is much higher than black coffee but worth it for the creamy taste.

**Key points to consider**:

* **Whole milk**: Adds about 9 calories per tablespoon.
* **Creamy texture**: Enhances the flavor of coffee.
* **More calories**: Increases the overall calorie count.

# Skim Milk

Skim milk is a lower-calorie option compared to whole milk. It provides a lighter texture while keeping the calorie count low.

Here’s a quick look at the calories in coffee with skim milk:

|Ingredient|Calories|
|:-|:-|
|1 cup of black coffee|2|
|1 tablespoon of skim milk|5|
|1 teaspoon of sugar|16|

If you add 2 tablespoons of skim milk and 1 teaspoon of sugar to your coffee, you are looking at about 28 calories. It is a good option for those who want to keep their coffee low in calories.

**Key points to consider**:

* **Skim milk**: Adds about 5 calories per tablespoon.
* **Lighter texture**: Less creamy than whole milk.
* **Fewer calories**: Helps in keeping the calorie count low.

# Plant-based Milks

Plant-based milks are a great alternative for those who are lactose intolerant or prefer a vegan option. These milks vary in calorie content depending on the type.

During these 40 days, many Christians fast from meat, luxury foods, alcohol, coffee, entertainment, or specific habits as a form of spiritual discipline.

For Muslims, Ramadan started on Fri, Feb 28 and will end on Mar 29. It is the ninth month in the Islamic lunar calendar. During this month, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset. They abstain from food, drink (including water), smoking, and sexual intercourse.

This year, the periods of Lent and Ramadan overlap. This is not always the case because Lent depends on the Gregorian solar calendar while Ramadan uses the Islamic lunar calendar.

Interestingly a study concluded that most people put on weight in Ramadan than lose weight, this makes sense due to cultural norms of having a big feast every night and lots of fried/oily food and iftar invites. Plus people panic eat when they know they are going to be fasting the next day. 

I always gained weight which is bad coz I’m already overweight, it’s because of my family tbh I hate their hyper fixation on food and shoving food down my throat every Ramadan. I wanted to just have dates with a cup of coffee for suhoor but keep getting told it’s not enough. Mind you I’m pretty sure it’s sunnah to have just dates, but they are always insisting on having 2 big meals! 

This year I’m losing weight by growing a backbone and constantly turning down food no matter how insistent my family are. It’s working alhamdullilah scale is going down every week.

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

I assume an appropriate approach is a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

1j6gvbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1j6gvbx/i_hate_my_husband/,I hate my husband,"(I posted this on another community, i forgot this marriage community existed too lol)

Well i dont hate HATE him. I still respect my husband. He provides a lot, roof over me and our son’s head, food on the table, water to drink.. yeah what am I complaining for right? I should always be grateful that im in this position, which i am. It’s just there are things that still bothers me, that ruins my mood, sucking the soul out of me little by little, draining my life day by day, inch by inch. Idk if im just a whiny wife, but here are some things that messes w my head everyday:

1) He NEVER puts his coffee mugs in the sink after he used them, there’s always hundreds of them outside where he smokes (i told him a million times to put it in the sink after he finish using it, i dont mind washing it, JUST PUT IT IN THE FUCKING SINK) but noopee, still compiling outside the house. Til this day, i let it be, there are still 4-5 mugs outside the house, not gonna touch it ever unless he brings it in. This is so sad for me, cus he knows i got a bad eczema on my hands, so everytime i wash BUTTLOADS of dishes, i have to wear gloves, wash the gloves, dry the gloves, also wash my hands bc rubber gloves makes me itchy a bit etcetc my main point is its hell and back on earth for me to do dishes, and he’s not considerate of that. We once had a big fight bc when we’re at our inlaws (his fam) he fucking WASHED HIS MUG??? Huh? Since when the fuck do u do that? So you care what your family says about you instead of caring about your eczema hands wife? Yea fuck you.

2) he rarely takes care of our son. I literally do everything. He only takes care of him if i told him to. Sometimes when i shower, i have to actually ask him ‘can you watch him for a bit’ he has this ugly smug face and said ‘k’ like um wtf? You’re supposed to b excited?? He’s your son??? You will b rarely seeing him cus you work offshore???? Get this, infront of his family, he acts so fatherly, playing with him, taking care of his diapers etc while me, if we’re actually home, IM DOING ALL THE FUCKING STUFF, not him. He literally does shit IF i tell him to. He’s never considerate of how tired i am 24/7. 90% of the time if I dont wanna see his smug face if i have to shower and no one is watching our son, i had to put our son in his crib and let him watch ms rachel on ipad, eventho it hurts me doing that cus im limiting his screen time. And what was my husband doing that time? PLAYING LEAGUE OF LEGENDS, and he’ll be like ‘sorry im in game, i cant quit’ well fuck you. And also get this, when i found out that im pregnant and i wanted to abort it (cus i know im not ready) he was the ONE who strongly insisted to keep it cus he said he cant wait to be a dad. Well step the fuck up bro

3) idk if im wrong or just exaggerating but he prioritizes his family over me and my son. If there was a fire, he would save his 4 brothers and 5 sisters instead of his wife and son. He would go to the ends of the earth for them ( once he had to deliver something car oil at 6AM for his sister n her husband, 6AM??? Mf usually wakes up at 2pm ffs. 

4) he has this obsession w fixing up old cars he would spend loads of money on it and w literally his blood, sweat, tears and his time. Yo i don’t mind mf got a hobby, i got a hobby too, that’s great for him, but wht abt when i need to shower???? Do i have to go outside to ask you to watch over our son again with your ugly smug face again?? to sum up he has 2 obsession, league of legends and his car. None of which you can bother him at all. My hobby is just gym. JUST GYM. FOR 1 HOUR. At which i can ONLY work out when my son takes his afternoon nap! I just want him to evenly schedule his hobby.. not to the point he doesn’t have time for his son or me. Do u think he listens? Nah. Everytime i told him this he’ll be like ‘this is the only time i can do this, while im working at sea i cant do this stuff’ im like HELLO? cars and games are forever?? Your wife and son could leave you or die anytime? wtf is his mindset mahn istg he’s still acts like a teenager. I literally feel like i have 2 sons as of this time.

5) his dirty clothes and socks. Need i say more? I feel like almost every wife experienced this. 

6) he spills his coffee and chocolate milk every where in the kitchen but never wipes it. (I once saw the mf VACUUMS his family’s kitchen bc there was a spilled rice grains). Basically he’s really sloppy. 

There are more but that’s the top of my head. Idk what I should do. Everytime i tell him whats been bothering me, we always have a huge fight and it always ends with (ok i promise i wont do it again) but he still does and its and endless cycle. I cant leave him bc I literally have no money to raise my son alone (AND my mom is getting old, so i have to take care of her too). So til now im just tolerating everything but it drains my energy so much but at the same time i put on a happy smile on my face for my son, i dont ever want my son to see depressed or angry. 

Mind you, he used to b very sweet and thoughtful at the beginning of our dating life and marriage life. I thought he was the most amazing guy. I know he loves me and my son, but i dont think he loves me enough to change his ugly habits. ",1,1741439559.0,Marriage,21,0.6,False

Would you pay $20,000 a month for an AI assistant? That's the eye-watering price tag OpenAI is slapping on their top-tier agents. We're talking $200 to $20,000—there's a zero or three added that’ll give accountants nightmares. But hey, these AI agents supposedly rival high-salaried professionals, who, as we all know, occasionally need coffee and sleep.

**The New AI Gold Rush**

AI pricing is more unpredictable than an internet meme. Companies like OpenAI seem to be setting prices based on what the market's frazzled nerves might voluntarily bear. Want an AI for software development? Prepare to part with $10,000 monthly. Too much? A startup called Cognition offers similar tech for $500 monthly—a significant saving unless you’re the kind of person who uses $100 bills as bookmarks.

Let's face it: the costs of AI are sky-high. Maintaining data centers and purchasing specialized chips corresponds to a serious investment. Imagine a server stack that costs more than the contents of Fort Knox before it's even powered up.

**Sticker Shock Reality**

While AI's initial promise was to slash costs and increase efficiency, we're seeing a gold rush mentality that's pricing out all but the most well-heeled of consumers. Sure, an AI that works 24/7 without needing a therapy session might sound appealing, but is it genuinely worth it?

For now, as startups navigate this Wild West of AI, they’re left to ponder: is that virtual assistant really worth its digital weight in gold, or is this just another step in the tech hype cycle?

I'd explain my personality as hard working, disciplined, harmonious, funny, happy go lucky and witty.

1j6gmbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/zoloft/comments/1j6gmbp/positive_testimony_on_xoloft_and_anxiety/,Positive testimony on Xoloft and anxiety,"Hello everyone, I had promised myself to come and write on this sub when I felt better, so here I am.

I absolutely wanted to write about my experience because when I was feeling down, reading about other people's experiences on Reddit, online blogs, or comments on YouTube videos dedicated to the subject made me feel much better because I felt less alone. Often, loneliness is the hardest part during a difficult psychological episode. Moreover, too many comments were pessimistic or even depressing, shared by people who were probably at rock bottom and desperate. Although I understand these people, too few decide to come back later, when they feel better, to share their recovery. As a result, the balance between positive and negative testimonials is biased by people's suffering.

In my testimony, I might mix up what is called ""Depression"" and ""Anxiety."" These two issues are distinct, but they are also very often linked; they dance around each other. Indeed, 9 times out of 10, a person suffering from depression also suffers from anxiety.

Spoiler alert: Antidepressants (specifically Xolft/Sertraline) worked for me. I would first like to present my testimony and then give some advice for those who are interested.

**Personal Experience**

I am a 28-year-old man, living in Paris and married. I have already experienced two antidepressant treatments in the past 5 years, the first in 2019 (Paroxetine, 1 year of treatment), then a relapse in 2021 (sertraline, 6 months). The summer of 2024 was my third depressive/anxious episode, following my thesis defense, which was certainly a trigger for my relapse.

I was suffering from generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, and various phobias. Living in constant stress eventually led to a mild depression in me, but overall, my main issue was chronic anxiety.

Unlike my first depression, I did not wait long before turning to a doctor when I experienced another panic attack (it had been years since I felt this way, and I was terrified).

The stress of finishing my thesis and the subsequent relaxation must have disrupted my nervous system because my condition only worsened after my thesis. I went on vacation but was overwhelmed by fatigue, headaches, anxiety, and my panic attacks became more frequent. I couldn't rest.

Although I knew that antidepressants are not harmful, I was disheartened because I felt like I hadn't managed to overcome this on my own. In hindsight, this mindset was purely about ego and pride, which is quite common in patients with these disorders. Due to my anxiety issues, I was prescribed Sertraline. 25 mg in the first week, 50 mg for 3 weeks, then 75 mg after the third week. I started my treatment at the end of August 2024.

I would describe depression as the manifestation of three symptoms: 1) physical exhaustion (feeling very heavy, difficulty getting out of bed, constant fatigue), 2) cognitive exhaustion (headaches, dizziness, inability to concentrate, memory lapses, difficulty performing basic tasks like reading or socializing), and often, but not always, emotional instability (crying unexpectedly, feeling empty, despair).

The treatment is a battle; it can make you feel worse for several days before you start to feel better. I remember telling myself, ""3 weeks! After 3 weeks, everything will be better."" I started to feel positive changes by the second week, but they didn't last. I can now say that after 4 weeks, I started to feel consistently better without interruption. I assure you, during those 4 weeks, I felt good at times but not continuously; anxiety and depression would strike randomly.

**Advices**

Here are some tips that might help you in your daily life:

1. Learn to rejoice in the smallest daily progress and take a step back from any setbacks. To do this, you must first distinguish between symptoms related to your depression/anxiety and the side effects of the treatment. It's not always easy to understand whether what you're feeling is due to the medication or the illness. To help you, consult your doctor. For example, if you didn't have stomachaches before starting the treatment, then it's a side effect. Progress will be made both in terms of your depression and the side effects of the medication. In the first week, you might feel nauseous, which disappears in the second week—that's progress. After 2 weeks, you might feel less anxiety but still severe depression; focus on the progress made with anxiety. In the end, you will feel 100% better on all fronts; you just need to be patient. One day, you might manage to go grocery shopping and even cook something good, and the next day, you might stay home and eat pizza. It's never a big deal; focus on the improvements, no matter how slow they seem.
2. Here is a list of side effects I experienced -> extreme fatigue/inability to move (end of the first week and second week), stomachaches (a few days in the first week), brain fog (weeks 1/2/3), loss of appetite (week 1), increased anxiety (end of week 1 and week 2), dark thoughts (1-2 brief moments during the first two weeks).
3. If possible (be kind to yourself if you break these rules), avoid drinking coffee or alcohol for a while. The former is a stimulant that promotes anxiety, and the latter is a depressant.
4. Walk! Walk! Walk! As much as you can. You will be fighting your thoughts and ruminations—a flood of thoughts and emotions that will overwhelm you. You are not currently capable of dealing with them satisfactorily; try to distract yourself and clear your mind as much as possible. Walking and exercise are excellent for this. In the long term, appropriate therapy will help you sort out these thoughts and emotions. Breathing exercises are also helpful for coping with difficult moments.
5. Don't rely too much on other people's testimonials. Everyone experiences this battle uniquely. Take the information that seems relevant, inspiring, and reassuring to you, but don't panic if you don't relate to someone else's experience (including mine :) ).
6. Talking to your loved ones: This depends on your environment. Some people (friends, loved ones, colleagues) may not understand you, and you shouldn't hold it against them. What you're going through can seem very strange to someone who has never experienced it. If you remember, you might have been the same way before, believing that willpower alone could overcome anything. Try to find someone you think will be receptive and try not to focus too much on them. Depression/anxiety is also difficult for those around you. Try to have multiple people you can share your suffering with in turn. The best thing to do is to make an appointment with a psychologist (if you can afford it) who specializes in ""Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"" (CBT) and see them regularly (once a week if possible). When you feel better, I strongly recommend continuing to see your therapist, perhaps less frequently, but it is essential to understand yourself better in the future so that this experience is the last.
7. Anxiolytics: Antidepressants have shown no long-term side effects. The public is often misinformed about this medication and confuses it with ""anxiolytics."" The latter are very effective but should be taken sparingly and under the supervision of a doctor who will monitor your intake. I occasionally took anxiolytics during the 4 weeks of Sertraline treatment to cope with the most difficult moments and to handle emergencies with more confidence. These occasional uses did not make me dependent, and I stopped taking them once the antidepressant started to work. If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor about possibly prescribing sleeping pills for a short period.
8. To confine yourself or not -> I decided to dedicate myself 100% to understanding and treating this illness. I was fortunate to have social security, unemployment benefits, and health insurance, but I realize that for some of you, it is unthinkable to confine yourself during recovery (family, work). However, if you can afford it or if loved ones can take care of you, don't hesitate too much because what you need is rest and to minimize stress as much as possible. Staying home too much is not ideal either, as boredom and lack of activity can lead to rumination. In any case, it's a difficult ordeal, and to alleviate it, you will need to learn to balance between doing nothing and resting and forcing yourself to do something to avoid too much rumination. This balance is very hard to find, given that nothing seems appealing, and you have no energy, but doing nothing also risks letting the worst intrusive thoughts take control.
9. Keeping a journal: This advice can be hard to follow because often you don't have the strength or discipline. However, keeping a journal has several advantages: a) It allows you to ""fix"" the thoughts that torment you, to release certain ruminations that you have in your head and never come out. Writing them down can convince you that your thoughts are stored, and even if they don't have answers, at least they are there, and you can come back to them when you're ready. b) It helps you have an objective view of your progress. During your journey of several weeks, you will sometimes feel good, sometimes empty, and sometimes very bad. Writing it down helps you be less fatalistic. For example, one day you might feel very sad and start to think that it has ""ALWAYS"" been this way. Even though you know it's not true, you are convinced of it. The journal helps you remember that some moments were less painful and focus on your recovery.
10. I'm sharing a YouTube playlist of videos dedicated to the subject for those who are interested. The videos are in French, but some are in English. [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL2GtcAVIgK-fEcE42H9lyLDGt5sPPPQE&si=pCGMFUw9DqJXusJ\_](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL2GtcAVIgK-fEcE42H9lyLDGt5sPPPQE&si=pCGMFUw9DqJXusJ_)

**Conclusion** 

Patience is key. You might be in a long tunnel right now and can't see the end. It exists, and if you're here, it's because you've already done more than half the journey. You are aware of your problem, you are seeking to resolve it, AND you will succeed. Don't believe that you are weak or lack willpower because having such a disorder can clearly indicate the opposite -> You might have invested too much in your work or a relationship. You might have faced traumatic episodes that didn't heal properly. Sometimes it might just be a serotonin deficiency, as some people are born with. No one would say that a diabetic is ""weak"" because they can't manage their sugar levels. Is Michael Phelps weak? The greatest athlete of all time? No, maybe just misinformed and careless about his invincibility, but not weak.

In the face of the absolutes that depression makes you endure, don't jump to hasty conclusions. Your own brain is playing tricks on you. You will get better; you just need to be patient.",3,1741438689.0,zoloft,1,1.0,False
1j6gm36,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j6gm36,Spring is Here—And So Is the Chance for New Love & Connection 🌸,"
You know that feeling when the sun finally stays out a little longer, the air smells fresher, and suddenly the world feels… lighter? Yeah, that’s spring. And honestly, there’s no better time to shake off the winter blues and step into something new—whether that’s love, connection, or just feeling more open to possibilities.

For a lot of us in the trans community, dating can feel like a rollercoaster. Some seasons are full of excitement, others feel like nothing’s moving at all. But if winter was a time of waiting, healing, or just surviving—spring is the perfect reminder that nothing stays stagnant forever.

🌿 Growth Happens Naturally – You don’t have to force anything. Just like flowers bloom when they’re ready, connections happen when the time is right. Maybe that means putting yourself out there, or maybe it just means being open to whatever (or whoever) comes your way.

🌸 Letting Go of the Past – Old dating disappointments? Done. Fear of rejection? We’re leaving that behind, too. Spring is about fresh starts, and that includes the way we see ourselves and our potential for love.

🌞 Getting Out There—In Whatever Way Feels Right – This could be the season you update your dating profile, go on a spontaneous coffee date, or even just flirt a little more for fun. No pressure, just vibes.

🐝 Little Steps Lead to Big Things – Love doesn’t always show up in fireworks and grand gestures. Sometimes, it’s a good conversation, a shared laugh, or just knowing someone sees you for who you really are. Those small moments? They matter.

So, if you’ve been feeling stuck, take this as your sign—it’s time to open up, even just a little. Love, connection, and new experiences are out there. And this season? It might just be yours.

I've known him since preschool, we spent a lot of time together, visited each other as kids, and were classmates in elementary school. We also hung out as teenagers and spent a lot of time together. Despite him being my best friend, nothing ever happened between us, except for one time when we kissed, which led to hugging, and he then asked if he can touch and see my boobs. I didn’t mind because we had known each other forever, and he had seen me in a bra. This happened when we were still teenagers. 

The problem is that he started controlling me more and more. Like I’m at home, and he’d suddenly call saying he wanted to go out, but he was already standing at my door, emotionally pressuring me into going out. Even when I agreed to go out for a short while, just for a few minutes, he always found excuses to keep me out for a long time. If I agreed to have just one beer, it always turned into more—I'd tell him I needed to leave, but he’d order another one at the bar. Or he’d suggest going for a walk, but I already knew he’d want to go here and there and wouldn’t take ‘no’ for an answer. He also couldn’t stand it when I had a different opinion on something. He always needed to be right. When we talked, he would always stand extremely close to me, which made me uncomfortable. I told him this many times, but he kept doing it. He constantly demanded my attention and wanted to be around me all the time. 

I had enough, so I started acting colder towards him. That’s when he became even more relentless. I didn’t know what to do, so I started avoiding him, not replying to his messages—I basically ghosted him because I didn’t know what else to do. But we lived close to each other, so he kept running into me. Then he left for a long time abroad, and I finally had some peace. I didn’t reply to his messages, I started ignoring his calls, etc. Years passed. When he returned, he sent me a message saying that his mother was dying. But I just couldn’t bring myself to reply because I was already mentally drained from him. Then he happened to see me outside and confronted me, saying he just wanted to talk in difficult times and couldn’t understand why I had stopped writing to him. So I explained it to him. I felt bad afterward, and shortly after, his mother passed away, leaving him completely alone.

But then he started being pushy again, and I really didn’t know what else to do except ghost him again. Years passed without contact. He sent me a very long message about his current life, which I ignored. In the meantime, I started feeling guilty about how I had treated him.

A few days ago, I randomly ran into him again. He immediately reached out to me, asked me to grab a coffee, and even though I had no time at all, I went with him. It was actually kind of nice, and I was happy that maybe this could have a happy ending. I arranged another meeting with him, but after that, he wanted another one right away, then another the next day. He started calling me again, texting, followed me on Instagram (he pressured me , and sending me pictures from his trips—him sunbathing at the beach, working out at the gym, showing off his muscles. He started texting about how he talks about me to all his friends. Whenever we were together, he was just as annoying as before, standing extremely close to me, trying to touch me. I’ve had enough of him and don’t know how to get rid of him. Ghosting again?""",1,1741438259.0,AskMenAdvice,8,1.0,False
1j6ghp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianTeenagers/comments/1j6ghp4/farewell_gone_wrong/,"""Farewell Gone Wrong!""","My farewell was the best farewell one could ever have! We were all dressed in our school white uniform, looking like disciplined angels (or prisoners, depending on how you see it). They took ₹200 from us, and in return, we were blessed with a lavish menu—one chamcham, a mini kachori, and an unidentified sweet stuffed in a mini mithai ka dabba, along with a tiny cup of coffee. Money well spent, right?

Now, because discipline is life, boys and girls had separate entrances, separate seating, and probably even separate oxygen supply. The farewell lasted for two hours, out of which:

1 hour was purely the principal and chairman’s speeches (which felt like a TED Talk marathon).

30 minutes were spent maintaining discipline (because we were obviously getting out of control by sitting quietly).

And in the remaining 30 minutes, we speed-ran our mini mithai ka dabba while a guy from our class dared to perform stand-up comedy—only to get scolded for it.


Now, for the most awaited part—the farewell gift. We were handed a set of two blue pens and one cello tape. Yes, cello tape. Maybe the pens were for our bright future, and the tape… probably to keep our mouths shut forever.

And the ultimate irony? When we entered this school, we were welcomed with a tikka on our foreheads. And now, at our farewell, we were given cello tape. Poetic justice.

Oh, and just to make this extravaganza even more thrilling—phones were not allowed. Because why would we ever want to capture such an iconic event?

Truly, a farewell we’ll never forget. (Even if we try.)

From the very beginning of our friendship since high school aware na ko na mas may pera talaga ako. Even if that meant a 1000 peso a week baon vs. her 300 peso a week baon. So kahit kakain lang kami sa karenderya ililibre ko na sya. Which is okay for me because I love seeing her and I NEED to see her and if I waited until she was financially capable, I would never see her. 

As we grew older, my baon didn’t change but we did get jobs. Mine paid way more. So our karenderya dates turned into coffee shop dates that I paid for. 

Then eventually, I got married to a partner who would support me financially in addition to my work pay— so all in all I am very comfortable financially while she’s a girl in her 20’s trying to make things work. SO I GET IT!

Ganto set up namin, I invite her to hang out tapos either I’ll book her a grab or pay for kung ano mang fare nya. Then while we’re together I pay for everything, kahit ano man yan. Resto bill, nail date, cafe bill, random shit we get sa mall, etc. kahit pasalubong for her mom. My partner and I even invite her to our travels, all expense paid. Wala akong complaints ever, I never say anything. Usually when we hang out I end up spending 10k-20k in a day. An amount that I prepare for mentally throughout the week naman. 

Anyway, this week I got into some financial trouble. Di naman sya breaking, like di ako naubusan ng pera or nagkadebt. I just ended up spending around 200k in 1 week for something very important (that I can’t disclose) and I was telling her how this basically stressed me out financially and I felt like I couldn’t splurge on myself anymore until I could make the money back or at least some of it. Kinwento ko how I couldn’t sleep dahil don, and how I’m literally not letting myself eat nice food because nga ang gastos… 

After the rant, we moved on to anong plans namin this weekend. Suggest ko movies kasi di masyadong magastos. During the convo minention nya “by the way will you buy this purse that you always wanted?” Sabi ko hindi because di ko nga kaya mag splurge on myself right now… tapos ang response nya “if it helps you feel any better I’m asking so you could get me a gift ;)” kasi whenever I get something pag magkasama kami, I get the exact one in a different color for her too. 

AYON EDI NAIYAK AKO KASI BIGLANG NARAMDAMAN KO YUNG FINANCIAL BURDEN OF BEING HER FRIEND. THE FACT NA NEVER KO TALAGA SYA MAKIKITA UNLESS AKO NAGBABAYAD. 

The problem is, I love her so very much. She does so much for me. I go through a lot of shit and malayo ako sa family ko so she’s really all I have. She isn’t fake or entitled or anything, I think we just accidentally got into this cadence of me paying and her not ever needing to ask. It was years of conditioning. I know she loves me too because mahirap talaga ako maging friend as a person with depression na laging may iniiyak na random thing hahahah. 

So idk what to do at this point. Seeing her has become a luxury. A privilege I have to allow myself to have… ",6,1741438168.0,OffMyChestPH,10,1.0,False

Naturally people went there since it was significantly cheaper. They claimed people should support local and it’s unfair.

Look, I love some of the local businesses in my area and I know not all of them are bad, but can we stop acting like every SLB deserved our support simply because they’re local? A lot of this SLBs have super overpriced stuff that I cannot justify spending money on.

A new burger place opened up in my area and this place charges $18-$20 for burgers. Like why should people spend $18 on a fucking burger? And it was mediocre and tastes the same as a burger half that price (I tried it). Breakfast places can also be terrible too. Tell me why I’m spending $50 on breakfast with me and another person and we only got two sandwiches/sides and two drinks? And you could argue “Oh it’s because it’s way better quality” but for the most part it’s really not. I could get stuff like this at a chain restaurant with the same quality for a lower price. Coffee shops be charging like $7-$9 dollars for a 12oz iced coffee that tastes mediocre as fuck and I can head to Dunkin’ and get a better coffee for like $3. 

Respectfully, if you want people to support your SLB, your business should be good. If you sell shitty products/services at a shitty price, I will gladly take my business elsewhere. That’s basic business 101. And I know this because there are some SLBs that also have somewhat high prices, but the product is so good I actually will come back! Local cafe sells these breakfast avocado sandwiches that are like $11 but they are extremely delicious. That’s a place I’d go back to.

So to the entitled SLB owners, if you want to charge a high price, fine. But when people don’t buy it, don’t hide behind the excuse that “people hate supporting local” no we do not. We just want quality products for a quality price. If your SLB is failing, it’s not because people won’t support local, it’s because your business sucks.",2,1741437984.0,PetPeeves,1,1.0,False

His Chihuahua loves me and immediately jumped into my arms, getting my glasses all covered in saliva. I asked my brother’s wife where I could find some wet wipes to clean my glasses, and she pointed to a shelf.

When I took the wipes, she started speaking a rude way, that I had grabbed the wrong ones. I got angry and headed toward the exit. Right by the door, I tried to talk to her.

She said I irritated her because of the way I behaved in the past (she didn’t like that I was sloppy, though personally I think she was just picking on me).

I said that I had only taken the wrong wipes by accident, and whatever I did in the past didn’t give her the right to yell at me or be rude.

She said I annoyed her. I replied that the fact I annoyed her was no reason for me to accept her being rude to me.

She then said that  I irritate her and its her home, she can act however she wants towards me and I have to eat that. 

After that, I left my brother’s apartment without another word.

For a while, I didn’t go to visit them, even though my whole family spent time there.

One day, my brother invited me over, and I did visit. Another time, he invited me to join a barbecue with a group of people.

Also, in her own family, my brother’s wife is often rude to her mother, her uncle, and so on. For example, she was shouting at her mom for accidentally breaking the coffee cup.

In my brother’s wife’s family, there’s a tradition of giving gifts to one another on various holidays.

On one of these holidays, my brother’s wife gave me a T-shirt. It was difficult for me to thank her in person because I still felt disrespected, so I asked my brother to pass on my thanks.

On another holiday, I bought gifts for my brother’s daughter and for my brother’s wife. I didn’t want to give his wife a gift, but I felt obligated since she had given me one.

Suddenly, I felt very angry and wrote to my brother that his wife shouldn’t give me any more gifts and that I wouldn’t give her gifts either, because I was still upset about that time she was rude to me and about her generally rude behavior toward me.  
My brother didnt answer anything.

I’m not sure whether I should participate in this gift-giving tradition, and I don’t know how to deal with her rudeness.

I need advice on how to behave towards her in the future.  Should I just accept her being rude to me or stop communicating with her at all.

After a few nice messages we switched to WhatsApp and exchanged voice notes.
He also send me a lot pictures from his life and his horse , dogs on the horse compound etc. 
I feel like it was definitely the attractive guy.

So after like having a good base of texting down,  I asked him what kind of arrangements he was looking for, he said something serious. 
I shared that I was looking for pay per meet arrangements at the beginning and would love for it to develop into a monthly thing. 

He said that he is new on the site and that he did not know the lingo and he asked me to explain. So I send him a link to a site where ppm as well as other sugardating lingo was explained.


He then just stops texting and the profile picture on WhatsApp disappears. 
Later he writes me on seeking that he is looking for something different.

I feel like this guy wanted someone to text with between business calls. He was also sharing s lot about his life in voice messages including his breakfast and workout routine.
It felt like he was wanting to hear himself speak and had no intention to arrange an in person meeting as soon as possible.
He was attractive but cmon, I'm on seeking for a reason, to find a mutually beneficial arrangement.

So I wonder what this guys intentions were.
I feel like sugar dating sites and seeking is full of guys that just want to date and have sex without spoiling/ gifting/supporting. 

Like paying for coffee and dinner is already enough. 
I feel like my time has been wasted. 


And then there are the traveling business men that think a small amount  is enough sugar for a late night hotel visit, as if Sugar baby's were low end escorts, like wtf ?! 

Am I the only one having these weird experiences?
What happened to sugar dating !?

1j6g4fs,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1j6g4fs/i_was_sober_for_two_years_and_decided_to_drink/,I was sober for two years and decided to drink again…,"Hi everyone, how are you all doing today?

I’m what some people would call a *Problem Drinker*. 6 beers a night, sometimes more. I still manage to always get my daily chores completed. I never day drink.

In 2022, on New Year’s Eve - I decided that would be my last drink and that 2023 would be the start of new things for me. And I managed just over two years of sobriety. I was like a different person by year two. I was calmer, I enjoyed doing normal things again and didn’t even think about drink apart from the very rare occasion. Friends and family were so proud of me.

In January of this year, I received some news which I didn’t expect. A few hours later, I’m drinking again. It was a miserable experience. Sure, it numbed me at the time. But the aftermath was just horrible.

We’re now in March and I’ve tried quitting a few times, with no success. And I want to list the negative things about my experience over the last few months:

- Spent ridiculous amounts of money on beer and rum using Uber services. I was getting the same driver bringing it to me on a few occasions which was embarrassing.

- Argued with people. Had no patience with my kid. Have been snappy, tired, depressed and emotional on most days.

- Zero energy. I would work out every day before starting on the alcohol again. I just don’t work out when I’ve been on the poison the night before.

- Spent a fortune on stuff I don’t really need whilst drunk and not even realised until the morning after.

- The worst part: no-one, and I mean NO-ONE knows that I’ve been drinking again. This in itself has been incredibly stressful. My recycling bags were taken yesterday and the amount of empty bottles and cans was eye opening. There isn’t one person on my street that ever has this amount of empties in their bags, which speaks volumes. I even cancelled on my mother visiting because I didn’t want her to see the bags full of shame.

There’s a million other reasons why the last few months have sucked and it’s mainly due to one aspect of my life: alcohol. It brings nothing but problems for me. I’m a person who is diagnosed with depression and I take anti depressants for it. My doctor said years ago “Don’t drink with Prozac, you might as well just throw the pills in the bin”. That has always stuck with me and it’s so true.

So, here we go again. Let’s try sobriety again, one day at a time. I’m actually in a surprisingly good mood. I don’t have the stress of using the Uber app to order alcohol today, and bulking up the basket with food so it doesn’t look like I’m an alcoholic. I don’t have the worry of my mother or a friend swinging by for a coffee and finding me drinking.

I can use the experience of my recent two years of sobriety. And if I approach this with the same mindset as before, I should be just fine. I just need to remember: alcohol is a poison. There are zero benefits. None. Drinking for me is a futile exercise, it only ends in pain.

I guess the point of this post is - even after two years of sobriety, I realised that I simply can’t just have one or two beers. It’s always 6-7 beers, then bad food, then the shame. And then I’ll do the same the next evening, and the next.

My last drink was at 23:42 on Friday March 7th 2025.

Then realised the food delivery I ordered was actually sent to my old house, that I moved out of 1.5 years ago and I have no way of picking it up. I rang customer service and they were really rude and nothing got resolved 😭. I’m low on money atm so this really stressed me. 

My plan was to go to therapy and then meet a friend to watch a rugby match at the pub. I got a text from my friend asking where I was, I completely forgot that I agreed to meet her before the match for food and then she was going shopping while I was at therapy. So then I apologised and we agreed to meet later. 

Then I went to get ready for therapy and realised my clothes were dirty, tried washing them and drying them but didn’t have time. Ended up in a panic putting on damp clothes and then couldn’t figure out what else I needed to bring with me from my messy room. 

Realised I wouldn’t make the bus on time and felt so overwhelmed I couldn’t go. So I texted my therapist to explain I couldn’t make it and sent her the money. 

Now I’m sitting here trying to find a way to calm myself for the rest of the day. I’ve just sat down and had a breakfast and decaf coffee and put the clothes I was wearing back in the dryer. 

I was honestly on the verge of a panic attack and feel so overwhelmed to leave my house and go meet my friend now.

I won't mention the final cost anymore, being in Austria and having to spend almost double the pledge amount, it is what it is, nothing i can do about it now...

I paired my Go with a Kingrinder K1 manual grinder for that full manual experience and i think it's a nice combo...after going through 60g of coffee before actually dialling it in...

1st attempt: water went through like i had no coffee whatsoever

2nd attempt: ground so fine that no water went through and i was afraid the whole thing would explode hot water in my face...

3rd try: 15g in, 35g out in almost 30s...not a bad result and the coffee tasted quite nice...

Oh, each time i pre-heated the cylinder

Some cons i noticed: you need running water to clean up after...kinda sucks as it can't really be used when hiking...and the puck won't come out easily as it does out of a regular portafilter...you need to scoop it out of there with something...the tamper could have been a tighter fit...

But, regardless, i think it will be good to take when travelling somewhere where there is access to (hot)  water...

I haven't tried the pod basket yet...

No significant wobble in my unit and it feels sturdy enough when pressing down on it...

Now, for who read this far: will someone make a case that fits the Go, it's accessories, a manual grinder  and perhaps a small scale or whatever else one might need extra? Maybe even a Nanofoamer...?",4,1741436204.0,FlairEspresso,1,0.84,False

I am grateful for my capacity to keep pushing, relentlessly, even when dark periods come (which they always will, as it’s intrinsic to this human experience).

I am grateful for modern convenience (aren’t dishwashers and the fact that water comes out when we open the tap amazing???!!!).

I am grateful that I am happy and healthy, that my family is happy, healthy, and beautiful, and that everything is exactly where it's supposed to be.

I am grateful that I feel so connected to those who have left us in this earthly realm. Even if my grandpa is not physically here, I feel him next to me constantly—his hand always on my shoulder and his gaze over me all the time.

I am grateful that, despite the fact that I am single right now, I am taking this time to learn about myself, solve old traumas, heal, and build—block by block—the life that I want, deserve, and that is already mine, but time hasn’t caught up yet.

I am grateful that I am now able to determine what I want and do not want in a relationship, and that this will allow me to find the exact person who is destined for me and for the future and the family I want to build.

I am grateful for my ability to see beyond.

I am grateful for my power of agency, my financial freedom, and my being.

It's serious.,"Hi, I'm 28M from eastern Europe and still living in this ""narcissistic prison"" with my nmother and my sister (her flying monkey) enmeshed and isolated with no one to turn to and in need of an advice from someone that successfully escaped from similar situation. 

In the past  I tried to open up to ""trusted friends"" but it went horrible, one defended the abusers,next one invalidated me,another one ignored and didn't listen at all so I cut the contact with them which put me into deeper isolation and into deeper trust-issues. 

I tried to contacted online help services in my country but when connecting there was an technical issue 2times! I had an appointment with the crisis psychologist but it cancelled because they didn't receive funds from the government. 

I don't talk with my peers from highschool or uni bcs of a feelings of inadequacy and bcs I feel tons and tons of shame for the family disfunction and abuse. It's like I can't relate to them people my age have families business seems successful seems like they are doing well in life and I'm here in this narcissistic prison with no money no job isolated.

 What's more unfortunate I have had bad experience in the workplace in general when in hope that co-workers and bosses will finally see me I was an easy target for explotation, manipulation and just being used bcs I trusted them. 
I wasn't paid my salary which put me into deeper hole of isolation,trust issues and a general disgust of working condition. I met people which I hoped will finally help me but they only saw me as an opportunity. 
Now I don't want to try anything at all. I was hoping that the outside world and people will be good to me, helpful since my
"" family"" wasn't. 

I didn't accomplish 2 universities because I didn't want to go there in the first place but I was forced by ""parents"" as when deciding about my future I was so so so scared of them that I didn't care about me I only cared about them and their satisfaction so they won't hurt me. 

From childhood I was interested in death. I remember asking an adult in a religious camp about the deadly dosage of coffee. I was 7. I tried to end it multiple times. I was sent to psych ward which only deepened my trauma and I had to lied my way out of that horrible horrible place. After that I didn't trusted my psychiatrist and she gave me some pills which made me more suicidal and like I couldn't think clearly so I stopped going there. I wish I could afford a good therapy.

I'm sensitive, empathetic and was mentally and emotionally abused during childhood at ""home"", bullied at the primary school, assaulted at the secondary school. I didn't have no one to turn to and I wasn't allowed to speak about it.Since that time I have fragmented memory and I feel like all this is happening to someone else. I was mentally and emotionally abandoned during puberty 0 guidance.I wasn't allowed to have interests wasn't allowed to build relationships with girls,peers. I wasn't allowed to have hobbies.I was like a soldier in a prison and I had to listen to every word of Nfather and enabling mother. I wasn't allowed to have my own space, the door of the room had to be always open and they had to know everything about my life so I didn't have any privacy and as soon as I tried to play with toys Nmother would persecute me and she tried to find any small detail what I did wrong nah I couldn't have a moment with myself in peace she had to ruin everything, so wrong. Talking too loud...being too much...Basically to control every small detail of my life.I was a puppet on a short leash their upbringing was like I was there to fullfill their orders and if they find anything wrong they would scream at me belittle me,ground me so sick! So I gave up trying to explore anything that would interest me because that wasn't allowed and brought me so much pain. From that point I've been severely depressed and withdrawn from everyone and everything. I soothed myself with and escaped into unhealthy coping habits, PC games, porn, overeating,drugs,gambling,risky behaviour, self loathing. I stopped with the serious stuff and working towards better me. Now I'm trying to put my life together escape narcissistic prison but I don't know what to do . 

May someone that successfully escaped from similar situation give me an advice?
