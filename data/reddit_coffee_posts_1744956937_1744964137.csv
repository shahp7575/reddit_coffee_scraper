I brew moka based cappuccinos daily at home and I‚Äôve found that medium dark roasts work best for me. Anything lighter, even a clean medium just doesn‚Äôt give me that sharp ‚Äúcoffee with milk‚Äù taste I‚Äôm after. Hope that makes sense.

Up until now I‚Äôve been pretty comfortable using preground coffee from Blue Tokai, usually going with their Attikan Estate medium dark roast for moka pots. 

I‚Äôve tried a few of their other options too and the only one that really stood out apart from Attikan was the 2024 Producers Series (even though it was a light roast, the flavors were sharp) That said, I haven‚Äôt explored anything outside Blue Tokai yet. But now that my 1Zpresso J-Ultra is on the way, I‚Äôm switching to fresh beans and grinding daily.

So I‚Äôm finally looking beyond Blue Tokai, what Indian roasters am I seriously missing out on for moka based cappuccinos?

Since I‚Äôm still figuring this out:

‚Ä¢ How do you usually store your beans?

‚Ä¢ Do you order fresh every 15 days, once a month or buy in bulk and freeze?

‚Ä¢ Anything I should be paying attention to when it comes to roast dates or freshness?

‚Ä¢ And for anyone using the J-Ultra with a moka pot, are there any gear or click settings you‚Äôve found that just work? I won‚Äôt really be able to tell right away if I‚Äôm getting the grind size right, so having a solid baseline would really help.

Thanks in advance!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Discovering the Richness of Vegan Hot Fudge Sauce

If you've been craving a decadent dessert topping that's both luscious and plant-based, vegan hot fudge sauce is the perfect treat for you. This rich, thick sauce drizzles beautifully over ice cream sundaes, fruit, or even warm baked goods. Creating it at home ensures you get a fresh, natural product made without dairy or artificial additives, allowing you to indulge guilt-free.

### Ingredients Needed for a Creamy Vegan Hot Fudge

To master this indulgent sauce, you'll need simple pantry staples that come together to form a perfect harmony of flavor and texture. Here's what you'll require:

- **Full-fat coconut milk:** Provides the creamy base and thick texture without dairy.
- **Unsweetened cocoa powder:** Offers that deep chocolate flavor essential for fudge.
- **Maple syrup or agave nectar:** Natural sweeteners that balance the bitterness of cocoa and add silkiness.
- **Pure vanilla extract:** Enhances the chocolate and adds warmth.
- **Salt:** A pinch to elevate all the flavors and cut through sweetness.
- **Dairy-free butter or coconut oil:** Adds richness and helps achieve the glossy finish of traditional fudge sauce.
- **Optional thickener:** A teaspoon of cornstarch or arrowroot powder can help if you want extra thickness.

### Step-by-Step Preparation for Perfect Vegan Fudge Sauce

Follow these simple steps to create a vegan hot fudge sauce that‚Äôs irresistibly thick and smooth:

#### Step 1: Mix the dry ingredients.

In a saucepan over low heat, whisk together the cocoa powder, salt, and optional cornstarch until well combined. The cornstarch will help thicken the sauce as it cooks, but you can skip it if you prefer a slightly thinner topping.

‚Äã -Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
#### Step 2: Add liquids and sweetener.

Pour in the full-fat coconut milk and maple syrup, stirring continuously to break up any lumps from the cocoa powder. The syrup dissolves into the mix, lending sweetness and a velvety texture.

#### Step 3: Heat and thicken.

Slowly bring the mixture to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat, stirring constantly. The sauce will begin to thicken as it warms. This step usually takes around 5 to 8 minutes‚Äîbe patient and keep stirring to avoid sticking or burning.

#### Step 4: Add fats and flavoring.

Once the mixture has thickened nicely, remove the pan from heat. Stir in the vegan butter or coconut oil for extra richness. Finish with a dash of pure vanilla extract to enhance the chocolate‚Äôs depth.

#### Step 5: Serve immediately or store.

The sauce is best served warm, pouring luxuriously over your favorite vegan vanilla ice cream or drizzling on freshly baked brownies. If you prefer a thicker fudge sauce that sets slightly, let it cool at room temperature or chill it gently in the fridge before serving.

‚Äã -Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
### Tips for Achieving the Ideal Texture and Flavor

- **Use full-fat coconut milk:** Light versions won't provide the necessary creaminess and smoothness essential to that perfect fudge sauce mouthfeel.
- **Adjust sweetness:** Taste test as you go. If you like very sweet sauce, add a little more maple syrup, but be cautious not to overpower the rich chocolate.
- **Consistent stirring:** Keeps the sauce velvety and prevents lumps or scorching on the pan‚Äôs surface.
- **Customize your chocolate intensity:** Try blending cocoa powder with a bit of melted dairy-free dark chocolate for an extra decadent experience.

### Enhancing Your Vegan Sundaes with This Hot Fudge

Your vegan hot fudge sauce instantly transforms any dessert into a gourmet experience. Pour it over dairy-free ice cream, sprinkle with crushed nuts, add fresh berries, or top with vegan whipped cream for a show-stopping sundae. The thickness and richness will delight anyone‚Äîeven non-vegans will ask for the recipe!

Creating this sauce from scratch allows you full control over ingredients, ensuring every spoonful is free from animal products and unnecessary additives. Plus, it‚Äôs quick to prepare and endlessly versatile.

### Storing and Reheating Suggestions

This vegan hot fudge sauce keeps well in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. When ready to use, gently warm it up on the stovetop or microwave in short bursts, stirring often to restore its luscious, pourable texture.

Now that you have the tools and steps for making this rich, thick vegan hot fudge sauce, you're all set to impress your guests‚Äîor simply treat yourself to the ultimate plant-based dessert indulgence anytime you crave.

Creative Ways to Use Vegan Hot Fudge Sauce Beyond Classic Sundaes
-----------------------------------------------------------------

<div>‚Äã -Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
### Exploring Delicious Ways to Enjoy Vegan Hot Fudge Sauce

 Vegan hot fudge sauce, with its rich, thick texture and deep chocolate flavor, is often celebrated as the perfect topping for classic sundaes. However, this luscious sauce is incredibly versatile and can be used creatively in a variety of dishes beyond the traditional ice cream treat. If you‚Äôre looking to elevate your vegan desserts or even some savory dishes, vegan hot fudge sauce is a game-changer waiting to happen.

### Drizzle It Over Fresh Fruits

 Fresh fruits like strawberries, bananas, pears, and apples pair beautifully with the creamy, chocolatey notes of vegan hot fudge sauce. Instead of a plain fruit salad, why not transform it into an indulgent dessert by drizzling the sauce over the top? This adds a luscious sweetness and a velvety texture that complements the natural juiciness of the fruits. You can also freeze the fruit for a chilled treat enhanced by warm fudge.

### Elevate Your Breakfast Favorites

 Think beyond savory breakfasts‚Äîvegan hot fudge sauce can bring a touch of luxury to your morning favorites. Pouring it over pancakes, waffles, or French toast creates an indulgent vegan breakfast experience. It can serve as a delicious alternative to traditional syrup, adding a rich depth of flavor.

#### Try These Breakfast Ideas:

- **Vegan pancakes** topped with a warm pool of hot fudge sauce and a sprinkle of chopped nuts.
- **Oatmeal bowls** drizzled with luscious hot fudge and fresh berries for a sweet, hearty start.
- **Toasted bagels** spread with vegan cream cheese and finished with a swirl of hot fudge for a sweet-savory combo.
 
### Use It as a Dip for Snacks

 Vegan hot fudge sauce isn‚Äôt just for pouring‚Äîit‚Äôs perfect as a dip, too. Imagine dipping pretzels, vegan cookies, or even fruit slices into a pot of warm, gooey fudge sauce. This easy snack idea is especially great for gatherings or parties, offering a sweet and chocolatey twist everyone will love.

### Incorporate It Into Baked Goods

 Adding vegan hot fudge sauce into your baking routine can enhance the richness and moisture of many desserts. Here‚Äôs how you can experiment:

- **Swirl it into brownie batter** before baking for decadent ribbons of fudge throughout.
- **Layer it between vegan cake tiers** as a chocolate filling for extra indulgence.
- **Drizzle it over cooled cupcakes** or muffins, using it as a silky glaze or drizzle instead of frosting.
 
### Create Decadent Vegan Milkshakes and Smoothies

 Blend vegan hot fudge sauce into a vegan milkshake for instantly upgrading it to cafe-level deliciousness. Its thick and rich texture combines well with plant-based milk, frozen bananas, avocado, or vegan ice cream to create creamy, dreamy shakes. You can even swirl some fudge sauce along the inside of your glass for a stunning visual effect and extra flavor with each sip.

### Add a Gourmet Touch to Toasts and Wraps

 For a surprising treat, try spreading a thin layer of vegan hot fudge sauce on toast or wraps. It pairs well with nut butters like almond or peanut butter, creating a silky, flavorful layer that complements crunchy textures. For example, a vegan banana wrap with peanut butter and a drizzle of hot fudge sauce transforms a simple snack into a delightful dessert-inspired meal.

### Use It to Top Vegan Cheesecakes and Pies

 The lusciousness of vegan hot fudge sauce is a perfect finishing touch on plant-based cheesecakes, tarts, or pies. Whether your cheesecake features a nut-based crust or your pie is filled with fruits like cherries or pecans, a generous pour of fudge sauce adds depth and indulgence. It turns these desserts into irresistible, show-stopping treats everyone will ask for seconds of.

### Innovate Vegan Hot Drinks with Fudge

 Vegan hot fudge sauce isn‚Äôt limited to cold or room-temperature applications; it also shines in warm beverages. Try stirring a spoonful into hot plant-based milk or coffee for a quick and delicious mocha variation. It melts beautifully, creating a creamy mouthfeel and rich chocolate flavor that's perfect on chilly days.

### Transform Trail Mix and Nuts

 For a unique snack twist, toss mixed nuts or dried fruits with a light coating of vegan hot fudge sauce, then let it set. This creates sweet, chocolate-covered clusters that are perfect for snacking or gifting. You get a balance of crunchy texture and chocolatey sweetness with every bite.

### Tips for Maximizing Your Vegan Hot Fudge Sauce

- **Keep it warm** by gently heating before serving to maintain that perfect pourable consistency.
- **Store airtight** in the refrigerator where it can last for up to two weeks, reheating as needed.
- **Customize flavors** by adding a pinch of sea salt, cinnamon, or a splash of vanilla extract to tailor it to different desserts.
 
 By thinking outside the typical sundae box, you‚Äôll discover that vegan hot fudge sauce is an incredibly fun and delicious ingredient with endless possibilities. From breakfast treats to sophisticated desserts and even snacks and drinks, its rich and thick texture brings an unforgettable chocolatey touch that enhances almost any dish. Try these creative ideas to enjoy vegan hot fudge sauce in new and exciting ways.

but no one ever hears the scream under my smile.

I laugh when I‚Äôm supposed to.
I walk where I‚Äôm expected.
But some part of me stays behind,
staring blankly at the spot where I used to feel real.

At night, I ask the ceiling

It creaks like it‚Äôs laughing.

Another quiet funeral

Or, to put it another way, what brand do the historic local Greek coffee vendors use?

I believe they are usually made of copper and lined with silver inside, or something fancy like that. 

I am sure (or hope, rather) that they are not using those cheap tourist ones that cost $2. And they are not buying them from Amazon or Ikea (so please do not send me links, I already know of those). 

I enjoy spending good money (guessing around $150) on gear like this. 

I was in Turkey a few years ago and bought a really nice one from them (it was $150, hammered copper and lined with silver onside‚Äîgorgeous!).  I am hoping that Greece has their own high-quality counterpart (even if it is a different style, although I strongly prefer a traditional style, not a modern ‚ÄúIkea-looking‚Äù one).

Silver, bow earrings.

Tiny, silver bows. Studs, no bigger than my gnawed, virtually non-existent pinky nail. Studs, in the shape of fancy hair ties, like the kind in princess cartoons about bitchy step-sisters and tiny men with big egos. Though I‚Äôm sure that specific design is common, probably something identical sold in every Claire‚Äôs nationwide, I‚Äôd never actual seen another human being wear them; only Amie. One, sole silver bow lying hidden, somehow only grabbing my attention by catching a quick, late afternoon ray running towards evening. The flash of silver light caught my eye as I was emerging from Kit‚Äôs kitchen and trotting across the family‚Äôs withered back porch- wood almost grey from the Oklahoma sun; a route I‚Äôve walked a million times but never before noticed the flash- a flash bright enough to feel like a beacon, a beacon powerful enough to make me lie to Kit yards ahead of me. That‚Äôs something I‚Äôd never done before. ‚ÄúHang on, got to tie my damn shoe.‚Äù In the time I bent over, made a loopty-loop and pulled, I knew for absolute certain what was half buried in the dirt beneath the decrepit deck. She was known for them; her wild, dirty-blonde ringlets somehow always neatly tucked behind one ear, displaying a single bow. Maybe this one here with me now. Amie‚Äôs earring.

I‚Äôm trying to jog to Kit, catch up to her headed to the back of the barn to practice, but my head is jogging faster than my feet ever could. Is it possible the cheap jewelry belonged to Kit years ago? Or one of the 20 other softball girls who‚Äôve came by Kit‚Äôs house- for a pre-season BBQ, to check on Kit‚Äôs mama after a radiation treatment or surgery, or just to hang with me and Kit? Of course, it is. But, the look in his eyes at the candle service- those empty, dark thoughts burning inside them hotter than the tea lights all around us. Then, seeing the unmarked suburban daily in the Braum‚Äôs parking lot behind his office building, how detached and distant Kit says he‚Äôs become, his hand too low on my back for too long. These are no longer just clues; this piece of the puzzle is evidence. A cold, hard case lying under our everyday feet. A case so cold, in fact, it will shatter my last best friend left standing, the last person I hold close, into a million pieces- our relationship with it, too. How do you tell the person you love that her dad probably took our best friend, and I‚Äôm sure the others, too? How do you ruin a life you cherish only to seek revenge? Spinning thoughts; my head is suddenly back to the teacups two summers ago we begged Mr. Richards to take us to. ‚ÄúWell, I suppose, if you girls insist,‚Äù he told us with a wink. Spinning, thinking back on every time Kit‚Äôs dad threw us a wink like that one, a sly smile, or a slightly inappropriate touch. Then, black. Nothing.

‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm suddenly hot, the September heat baking my already fried skin. My body feels the light, the heat, but my face doesn‚Äôt. I slowly open my eyes to find Mr. Richards hovered over me, kneeling beside me, covering my upper body in his dark shadow. I suddenly feel the weight and oozing sweat from his hand clutching mine. I yank it away. ‚ÄúHoney, are you ok?‚Äù he says too loudly with dramatized worry. I use what little strength I feel I have in me to quickly lift my head and look around. Kit. Tommy. Good, we‚Äôre not alone. Kit‚Äôs brother echoes behind his dad, ‚ÄúYeah, Collette, you okay?‚Äù but with a little bit of genuine concern mixed in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. Just got dizzy. Maybe because I haven‚Äôt eaten anything.‚Äù Second lie today. ‚ÄúTommy, run and grab her some chocolate or something, would ya?‚Äù Mr. Richards bellowed as he reached his wet palm out to try to help me up. I pressed mine into the gravel near my hips, hoisting myself up and turning away from him in one motion, telling Kit I‚Äôm really okay and to still throw me some pitches, using Districts coming up as an excuse. She held onto my shoulder and walked with me. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be pushing it too hard, girls. You‚Äôll work yourselves to death,‚Äù he hollered once again. Ice shot down my neck.

When I moved here, after my grandpa passed and my mom inherited his old place, Kit was the very first friend I made at school. She offered me part of her PB&J and an Oreo when I didn‚Äôt know to bring a snack for a field trip my very first week. She had my back from the start; just two nine-year-olds against the world. Shortly after, Amie joined in and introduced us to softball. We were hooked; to each other and the sport. The three amigos. I remember seeing Kit‚Äôs dad for the first time, standing behind the fence directly in Kit‚Äôs line of view from the mound. I remember thinking he had a strange look about him, like someone who‚Äôs hard to read. He had light brown eyes that were almost yellow in the game-day afternoon sun. They were slightly more tapered at the ends than most, and his smile was only turned up on one side of his face: a mischievous grin. Though his demeanor made me question him, his words towards Kit were nothing but encouraging. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go, Kitty.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou got this, baby.‚Äù ‚ÄúShake it off, kiddo.‚Äù I remember thinking he reminded me of a snake, the eyes and the grin, but not really in ways that made him bad or scary. He was good to Kit, that‚Äôs what mattered.

Now, all I see is a snake.

‚Ä¶.

Lying in bed that night, I weighed my options, pros and cons of every scenario. Not in my usual ‚Äòon paper in my notebook‚Äô way like I‚Äôd done 100 times before to solve a problem, wanting no paper trail connecting me to this, but in my already stuffed full of enraging and sickening thoughts mind.

What would happen if I told Kit?

Pros: She‚Äôd know; weight lifted off my shoulders. Justice for Amie. Closure for Amie‚Äôs mom, dad, and baby sister. Goodbye, Mr. Richards.

Cons: I‚Äôd once again watch Kit break, but this time she may not let me be around to help mend the pieces. Too big of a con.

What would happen if I went straight to the police?

Pros: I wouldn‚Äôt have to look Kit in the eyes and tell her that her old man‚Äôs a murdered and ripped a piece of us away.

Cons: Someone else still would, and I‚Äôd be a liar to Kit; still cast aside and not able to help. A worse Con.

Fuck.

There doesn‚Äôt feel like a clear path; everything feels hard. I suddenly sit up, unable to catch my breath. The world is spinning again, and I‚Äôm wheezing. I throw myself in the floor beside my bed, towards the bottom cabinet of my nightstand and pull out a Dollar General sack I somehow remember is waded up in there. I breath into it, then out. In. Out. I close my eyes. In. Out. A flash of Amie‚Äôs face enters my mind. In. Out. Then, a flash of all three of us, snapping our first ‚Äòselfie‚Äô on my first crappy flip-phone. In. Out. I open my eyes, and I know what to do. Justice. Peace.

‚Ä¶

No sleep, but my mom left about a half pot of coffee behind this morning. I fill a black thermal to the brim, take a big gulp, add a splash of creamer, snap the lid down, and head out the door. I‚Äôve got to catch Kit before she goes into school; it‚Äôll be too hard to pull us out once we‚Äôre in. My text is still on delivered, so she‚Äôs probably sleeping till the last possible second. Her dad will drop her whenever she says she‚Äôs ready to go; he‚Äôs never in a rush. She‚Äôll be late enough, she may not even check her phone before she‚Äôs already in class, if she remembers to grab it at all.

2 miles of dirt roads, 1 mile of pavement, then I‚Äôm locking my bike to the bars outside the west school entry. She always uses this door; her first class is the first door on the left from here. Conveniently, I can stand behind the evergreens on the south side of the double-doors and call her over without her dad spotting me, then we can keep hidden walking to the football bleachers- the closest hiding spot I could think of.

My plan runs smoothly, for once, but the hard part hasn‚Äôt begun.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, Coco? I mean, I‚Äôm totally cool with ditching, but what‚Äôs with the secrecy?‚Äù Kit asks with a chuckle, but also with slight concern, as we‚Äôre yards from the field.

I pull her beneath the bleacher stairs. I‚Äôm pretty sure no one‚Äôs around here at this hour, but here we are when we‚Äôre not supposed to be, so better safe than sorry.

‚ÄúI love you. I have your back no matter what, just like you‚Äôve always had mine. What I‚Äôm about to tell you is one of the hardest things you‚Äôll ever hear, but you need to hear it from me, and we can deal with it together. I‚Äôve got you, okay?‚Äù I try to say confidently but softly.

Her eyes are locked with mine, a slight mist filling both pair.

‚ÄúI found an earring of Amie‚Äôs outside your house, and there‚Äôs just several other details that point toward‚Ä¶ I think you and I should go to the cops and tell them everything we know, together. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, I probably am, but at least then‚Ä¶ we can help clear your dad‚Äôs name.‚Äù It all comes out of my mouth a little too fast.

There‚Äôs a full river running down both of her cheeks now, but her eyes are still fixed with mine. I see the pain in them, the sadness. I see a look of defeat and a look of grief.

I just don‚Äôt see a look of surprise.

The stare continues, tears streaming down both our faces now, pain and rage continuing to fill both, but I‚Äôm the only one with the look of shock. Her, not an ounce. In this moment, we have no words.

What feels like a lifetime later, she whispers ‚Äúhe‚Äôs my dad‚Ä¶‚Äù

She drops her gaze and walks past me, on to class. I hear one last thing she mumbles under her breath.

‚ÄúI thought I got everything.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúBecause of you, we found his DNA on the earring you showed us, along with Amie‚Äôs. They dug and found enough evidence of her; he‚Äôs going down for this. You brought your friend and her family some peace.‚Äù He was a young member of the Payne County department; I‚Äôm pretty sure his dad‚Äôs been there a long time.

‚ÄúAnd the other girls?‚Äù I asked him, quietly.

‚ÄúWhile we don‚Äôt have anything yet to connect him to the other four girls missing here, his DNA did match cases from crime scenes 18 to 19 years ago around the Texas A&M University area. Tom went to school there. Three cases, three young women killed, he matched them all. Guess he wasn‚Äôt as smart back then, technology just wasn‚Äôt so smart yet either. Anyway, we‚Äôre getting him for those too. He‚Äôs gone for good, Collette. You did good.‚Äù His badge says ‚ÄòAndrews‚Äô.

¬†‚ÄúDo you think he‚Äôs done these things this whole time‚Ä¶ since then?‚Äù The question made me nauseous to ask out loud.

‚ÄúIt seems to us that when he met Cindy, you know, uh, Kit and Tommy‚Äôs mom, he quit for a while. Maybe he was happy and didn‚Äôt feel the urge, maybe her getting sick triggered it again, we don‚Äôt know for sure- just know the FBI agents used the word ‚Äòdormant.‚Äô Kind of weird to think about‚Ä¶ kind of like a snake. Anyway, you‚Äôre young and smart; 15 years old and solving a crime for cryin‚Äô out loud. You‚Äôve got your whole life ahead of you. You don‚Äôt have to worry about this stuff anymore, kid. Time to move on.‚Äù A smile, a pat on the shoulder, and a slight nudge towards the door; Andrews was done with me, the whole department was; everyone, really. Case closed.

But, I think that word will stick with me; dormant- like a snake, lying perfectly still until the timing is right. He‚Äôll shed the layer of skin he‚Äôs been wearing- his disguise, his armor- and emerge from his hiding place; yellow eyes and a mischievous grin.

One that‚Äôs been popping up more and more recently is **[Interfinex](https://tinyurl.com/yta9t7dt)**.

If you‚Äôre curious about whether Interfinex is legit or just another sketchy trading gimmick, this post is for you. I‚Äôll walk you through the features, the pros and cons, how to get started, and a few things that surprised me (in both good and bad ways). Let‚Äôs get into it.

## What is Interfinex?

Interfinex is a **web-based trading platform** that uses automation and AI to help users trade a variety of financial assets‚Äîprimarily **cryptocurrencies**, but also **forex, stocks, and commodities**. It's designed to simplify complex trading strategies so that even people without a finance degree can participate in the market.

The platform uses algorithms to analyze market data in real time and execute trades on your behalf. You can customize your trading preferences, set stop-losses, and even copy strategies from other users. Think of it as a mix between a smart robo-advisor and an auto-trading bot with some manual controls sprinkled in.

## Who Created Interfinex?

That‚Äôs where things get a little murky. Like many of these trading platforms, Interfinex doesn‚Äôt make its founding team super public. There‚Äôs no flashy ""About Us"" page with smiling headshots of tech bros in hoodies. But based on what I‚Äôve been able to dig up, it's allegedly developed by a group of experienced traders and software engineers who‚Äôve worked on similar platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**.

While the lack of transparency is a bit of a red flag, it‚Äôs not uncommon in this space. Many trading platforms choose to keep their teams private to avoid targeted hacks or regulatory issues. Still, I‚Äôd prefer a bit more openness.

### [üî• Start Trading with Interfinex Today](https://tinyurl.com/yta9t7dt)
## How Does Interfinex Work?

Interfinex works by combining **automated trading algorithms** with user-defined parameters. Once you set up your account and deposit funds, you can choose to either:

- Let the algorithm trade for you based on market signals
- Set custom trading rules (like only buying Bitcoin under a certain price)
- Use the demo account to test strategies before going live

The platform scans global exchanges in real-time, looking for opportunities to buy low and sell high. It‚Äôs not magic, but it‚Äôs fast‚Äîfaster than any human could be. There‚Äôs also a dashboard where you can track your trades, manage your risk level, and view analytics on your performance.

It‚Äôs essentially a **semi-automated trading assistant**, not a get-rich-quick scheme. You still need to monitor your investments and understand the basics of market behavior.

## Interfinex Pros and Cons

Let‚Äôs break it down:

### Pros:
- **Beginner-Friendly Interface** ‚Äì Clean UI that‚Äôs easy to understand
- **Automated Trading** ‚Äì Great for passive income or people new to trading
- **Wide Asset Range** ‚Äì Not just crypto; also includes forex, stocks, and more
- **Demo Mode** ‚Äì Practice without risking real money
- **Fast Withdrawals** ‚Äì Usually processed within 1-2 business days

### Cons:
- **Lack of Transparency About Founders**
- **No Dedicated Mobile App Yet**
- **You Still Need to Monitor Trades** ‚Äì It‚Äôs not 100% hands-off
- **Minimum Deposit is $250** ‚Äì Not super high, but still a commitment

- Desktop computers (Windows/Mac)
- Laptops

Interfinex is available in most countries where online trading is legal. That includes:

- United States
- Canada
- United Kingdom
- Australia
- Most of Europe
- Parts of Asia and South America

It does **not** support countries with strict financial regulations or crypto bans (like North Korea or some areas in the Middle East). Always check your local laws before signing up.

It has:

I used a prepaid Visa card and it went through in minutes.

### Interfinex Customer Support

Honestly, the support team is better than I expected. Here's how you can reach them:

- **Live Chat** ‚Äì Available 24/7 (I tested it at 2am. Someone actually replied.)
- **Email Support** ‚Äì Usually responds within a few hours
- **Phone** ‚Äì A bit slower, but decent if you like speaking to a human

They were helpful when I had a question about withdrawals and didn‚Äôt try to upsell me anything, which I appreciated.

Go to the official Interfinex site and enter your name, email, and phone number. The registration process takes like 1 minute.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can either use the demo mode or jump right into live trading. Set your preferences, choose your assets, and let the algorithm do its thing.

## How to Delete an Interfinex Account?

If you decide to move on, you can request account deletion through customer support. Just email or use live chat and they‚Äôll close your account within 24-48 hours. They‚Äôll ask you to withdraw your funds first, which is fair.

1k1z3p6,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1k1z3p6/feedback_on_personality_not_performance_how_to/,"Feedback on personality, not performance, how to handle?","
I recently had a two-day placement in  surgery, where I did one morning shadowing a surgeon. I tried to stay engaged during the morning clinic ‚Äî I called in patients and took notes while he examined them. I really made an effort to be present and involved.

Afterward, he gave me feedback that caught me off guard. He said I have knowledge and curiosity, but that I need to work on my attitude. According to him, I have a ‚Äúsharp personality‚Äù and came across as disrespectful ‚Äî both toward him and the patients.

He didn‚Äôt give many concrete examples. He mentioned that I sat in a ‚Äúsloppy‚Äù way, that some of my comments were too sharp (but couldn‚Äôt specify which), and that I wasn‚Äôt socially aware because I didn‚Äôt bring him coffee when I got one for myself.

That part especially felt like a bit of a mind game. When I walked in with the coffee, he said, ‚ÄúThat looks good,‚Äù but nothing more ‚Äî and then later used it as an example of how I‚Äôd failed to pick up on a social cue. He said something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a big coffee drinker, but it would‚Äôve been nice if you asked.‚Äù I genuinely hadn‚Äôt thought of it ‚Äî and of course I would‚Äôve offered if he‚Äôd said something directly. Part of me can‚Äôt help but wonder whether he would‚Äôve held that against a male student in the same way. There was an unspoken expectation there that felt subtly gendered, as if I had failed some sort of unspoken social or nurturing test.

I‚Äôve reflected a lot since then. I know my style or attitude might come off as more direct or less traditionally ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù than some might expect in a clinical environment. But I am never rude, and certainly never disrespectful to patients. I care deeply about how I interact with people, and I always try to create a warm, honest, and respectful atmosphere.

That‚Äôs what makes this feedback so difficult to process. I was genuinely trying to be engaged and present, and yet I walked away feeling like my personality ‚Äî not my performance ‚Äî was the problem.

Since then, I‚Äôve felt angry, sad, and confused. It‚Äôs hard to know where the line is ‚Äî how much criticism you‚Äôre expected to just accept, and when it‚Äôs okay to say ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt fair.‚Äù I‚Äôve been stuck replaying everything in my head, wondering if I‚Äôm actually a rude person, even though I know I went in with good intentions.

## What is ArbiFlow?

**ArbiFlow is an automated trading platform** designed to help users trade across different markets and assets‚Äîincluding cryptocurrencies, forex, and commodities‚Äîusing real-time data and algorithmic strategies.

What sets ArbiFlow apart is its focus on **automation and user control**. You don‚Äôt need to be a professional trader to get started. The platform handles most of the heavy lifting, offering tools that analyze market trends and execute trades based on pre-set parameters. For people who are into arbitrage or short-term gains, this is a pretty slick tool.

The platform also claims to use **AI-driven algorithms** to detect profitable opportunities. Whether that‚Äôs marketing fluff or not, the interface gives you a lot of visibility into how trades are being made, which I appreciated.

## Who Created ArbiFlow?

This is one area where ArbiFlow could be a bit more transparent. The platform doesn‚Äôt list specific founders or a development team on their site. That‚Äôs not uncommon in the crypto world, but it does raise some eyebrows.

What we do know is that **ArbiFlow is reportedly built by a group of fintech professionals and software engineers** with experience in high-frequency trading and blockchain development. While I couldn‚Äôt find a whitepaper or LinkedIn profiles to back this up, the platform functions well enough that it feels like it was created by people who know what they‚Äôre doing.

Still, I‚Äôd love to see more transparency here, especially if they want to build long-term trust.

### [üî• Start Trading with ArbiFlow Today](https://tinyurl.com/2nwsh62f)
## How Does ArbiFlow Work?

ArbiFlow works by **connecting users to a network of brokers and markets**, then using automation to execute trades based on real-time data. You set your preferences‚Äîlike risk tolerance, trading pairs, and strategy type‚Äîand the platform‚Äôs algorithm takes over.

Here‚Äôs what happens under the hood:

- **Real-time data analysis**: Constant scanning of market prices across different exchanges.
- **Trade execution**: When conditions match your strategy, trades happen automatically.
- **Profit tracking**: The platform monitors performance and adjusts strategy if needed.

If you‚Äôre familiar with platforms like **Bitcoin Code** or **Immediate Edge**, ArbiFlow feels similar in terms of automation and ease of use‚Äîbut with a more modern interface and better mobile integration.

## ArbiFlow Pros and Cons

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what I liked and what could be better:

**Pros:**

- **Easy to use**, even for beginners.
- **Fast trade execution** with real-time data.
- **Supports multiple asset types** (not just crypto).
- **Mobile-friendly** with a smooth app experience.
- **Customizable settings** for strategy and alerts.

**Cons:**

- **No public team info**, which makes it feel a bit anonymous.
- **Minimum deposit of $250** may be high for cautious newbies.
- **Limited educational resources** for new traders.
- **Not regulated** in all countries.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access ArbiFlow?

You can access ArbiFlow on pretty much any device:

- **Desktop browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- **iOS and Android smartphones**
- **Tablets** with internet browsers

It‚Äôs built with a responsive design, so the user experience is solid across platforms. I personally used it on my phone during a long commute and didn‚Äôt feel like I was missing out on any features.

## ArbiFlow ‚Äì Supported Countries

ArbiFlow is available in most countries where crypto trading is legal. That includes:

- United States
- Canada
- United Kingdom
- Australia
- Most of Europe
- Parts of Asia and South America

It‚Äôs not available in countries with strict trading regulations like **North Korea, Iran, and a few parts of the Middle East**. If you‚Äôre unsure, the signup form will usually tell you if your country is supported.

## ArbiFlow ‚Äì Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is where ArbiFlow shines. The **real-time data engine** pulls price info from multiple exchanges and markets, giving you a constantly updated view of what's happening. Whether you‚Äôre into day trading or longer-term strategies, this is a killer feature.

### User-Friendly Interface

The UI is clean, modern, and intuitive. Even if you‚Äôve never traded before, you‚Äôll find it easy to navigate. The dashboard shows all the essentials‚Äîbalances, open trades, profit/loss‚Äîwithout overwhelming you with charts and jargon.

### Mobile Accessibility

The mobile app is actually good. Like, not just a stripped-down version of the website. All the core features are there, and I didn‚Äôt experience lag or crashes. You can literally trade from your couch or while waiting in line for coffee.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set **price alerts, trade confirmations, and strategy updates** to hit your email or phone. This is great if you‚Äôre not glued to your screen all day but still want to stay on top of things.

### Multiple Asset Trading

You‚Äôre not limited to crypto. ArbiFlow supports:

- **Cryptocurrency**
- **Forex**
- **Commodities**
- **Stocks (in select regions)**

That makes it a solid all-in-one platform for people who want to diversify.

## Is ArbiFlow a Scam?

I get this question a lot‚Äîand it's a fair one. Based on my experience and what I‚Äôve seen online, **ArbiFlow doesn‚Äôt appear to be a scam**. It works as advertised, lets you withdraw funds, and doesn‚Äôt promise outrageous returns.

That said, always be cautious. Start with the minimum deposit, don‚Äôt invest more than you can afford to lose, and use two-factor authentication. No platform is 100% risk-free, especially in crypto.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on ArbiFlow?

To get started with ArbiFlow, you‚Äôll need to deposit **$250**. That‚Äôs pretty standard for platforms in this space (Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge ask for the same). While it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, I do wish they offered a **lower entry point or a demo-only mode** for people who just want to test the waters.

### ArbiFlow Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7 via live chat, email, and phone**. I tested the chat function and got a helpful response within 3 minutes, which is better than most platforms I‚Äôve tried.

## How do you start trading on ArbiFlow?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Silver, bow earrings.

Tiny, silver bows. Studs, no bigger than my gnawed, virtually non-existent pinky nail. Studs, in the shape of fancy hair ties, like the kind in princess cartoons about bitchy step-sisters and tiny men with big egos. Though I‚Äôm sure that specific design is common, probably something identical sold in every Claire‚Äôs nationwide, I‚Äôd never actual seen another human being wear them; only Amie. One, sole silver bow lying hidden, somehow only grabbing my attention by catching a quick, late afternoon ray running towards evening. The flash of silver light caught my eye as I was emerging from Kit‚Äôs kitchen and trotting across the family‚Äôs withered back porch- wood almost grey from the Oklahoma sun; a route I‚Äôve walked a million times but never before noticed the flash- a flash bright enough to feel like a beacon, a beacon powerful enough to make me lie to Kit yards ahead of me. That‚Äôs something I‚Äôd never done before. ‚ÄúHang on, got to tie my damn shoe.‚Äù In the time I bent over, made a loopty-loop and pulled, I knew for absolute certain what was half buried in the dirt beneath the decrepit deck. She was known for them; her wild, dirty-blonde ringlets somehow always neatly tucked behind one ear, displaying a single bow. Maybe this one here with me now. Amie‚Äôs earring.

I‚Äôm trying to jog to Kit, catch up to her headed to the back of the barn to practice, but my head is jogging faster than my feet ever could. Is it possible the cheap jewelry belonged to Kit years ago? Or one of the 20 other softball girls who‚Äôve came by Kit‚Äôs house- for a pre-season BBQ, to check on Kit‚Äôs mama after a radiation treatment or surgery, or just to hang with me and Kit? Of course, it is. But, the look in his eyes at the candle service- those empty, dark thoughts burning inside them hotter than the tea lights all around us. Then, seeing the unmarked suburban daily in the Braum‚Äôs parking lot behind his office building, how detached and distant Kit says he‚Äôs become, his hand too low on my back for too long. These are no longer just clues; this piece of the puzzle is evidence. A cold, hard case lying under our everyday feet. A case so cold, in fact, it will shatter my last best friend left standing, the last person I hold close, into a million pieces- our relationship with it, too. How do you tell the person you love that her dad probably took our best friend, and I‚Äôm sure the others, too? How do you ruin a life you cherish only to seek revenge? Spinning thoughts; my head is suddenly back to the teacups two summers ago we begged Mr. Richards to take us to. ‚ÄúWell, I suppose, if you girls insist,‚Äù he told us with a wink. Spinning, thinking back on every time Kit‚Äôs dad threw us a wink like that one, a sly smile, or a slightly inappropriate touch. Then, black. Nothing.

‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm suddenly hot, the September heat baking my already fried skin. My body feels the light, the heat, but my face doesn‚Äôt. I slowly open my eyes to find Mr. Richards hovered over me, kneeling beside me, covering my upper body in his dark shadow. I suddenly feel the weight and oozing sweat from his hand clutching mine. I yank it away. ‚ÄúHoney, are you ok?‚Äù he says too loudly with dramatized worry. I use what little strength I feel I have in me to quickly lift my head and look around. Kit. Tommy. Good, we‚Äôre not alone. Kit‚Äôs brother echoes behind his dad, ‚ÄúYeah, Collette, you okay?‚Äù but with a little bit of genuine concern mixed in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. Just got dizzy. Maybe because I haven‚Äôt eaten anything.‚Äù Second lie today. ‚ÄúTommy, run and grab her some chocolate or something, would ya?‚Äù Mr. Richards bellowed as he reached his wet palm out to try to help me up. I pressed mine into the gravel near my hips, hoisting myself up and turning away from him in one motion, telling Kit I‚Äôm really okay and to still throw me some pitches, using Districts coming up as an excuse. She held onto my shoulder and walked with me. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be pushing it too hard, girls. You‚Äôll work yourselves to death,‚Äù he hollered once again. Ice shot down my neck.

When I moved here, after my grandpa passed and my mom inherited his old place, Kit was the very first friend I made at school. She offered me part of her PB&J and an Oreo when I didn‚Äôt know to bring a snack for a field trip my very first week. She had my back from the start; just two nine-year-olds against the world. Shortly after, Amie joined in and introduced us to softball. We were hooked; to each other and the sport. The three amigos. I remember seeing Kit‚Äôs dad for the first time, standing behind the fence directly in Kit‚Äôs line of view from the mound. I remember thinking he had a strange look about him, like someone who‚Äôs hard to read. He had light brown eyes that were almost yellow in the game-day afternoon sun. They were slightly more tapered at the ends than most, and his smile was only turned up on one side of his face: a mischievous grin. Though his demeanor made me question him, his words towards Kit were nothing but encouraging. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go, Kitty.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou got this, baby.‚Äù ‚ÄúShake it off, kiddo.‚Äù I remember thinking he reminded me of a snake, the eyes and the grin, but not really in ways that made him bad or scary. He was good to Kit, that‚Äôs what mattered.

Now, all I see is a snake.

‚Ä¶.

Lying in bed that night, I weighed my options, pros and cons of every scenario. Not in my usual ‚Äòon paper in my notebook‚Äô way like I‚Äôd done 100 times before to solve a problem, wanting no paper trail connecting me to this, but in my already stuffed full of enraging and sickening thoughts mind.

What would happen if I told Kit?

Pros: She‚Äôd know; weight lifted off my shoulders. Justice for Amie. Closure for Amie‚Äôs mom, dad, and baby sister. Goodbye, Mr. Richards.

Cons: I‚Äôd once again watch Kit break, but this time she may not let me be around to help mend the pieces. Too big of a con.

What would happen if I went straight to the police?

Pros: I wouldn‚Äôt have to look Kit in the eyes and tell her that her old man‚Äôs a murdered and ripped a piece of us away.

Cons: Someone else still would, and I‚Äôd be a liar to Kit; still cast aside and not able to help. A worse Con.

Fuck.

There doesn‚Äôt feel like a clear path; everything feels hard. I suddenly sit up, unable to catch my breath. The world is spinning again, and I‚Äôm wheezing. I throw myself in the floor beside my bed, towards the bottom cabinet of my nightstand and pull out a Dollar General sack I somehow remember is waded up in there. I breath into it, then out. In. Out. I close my eyes. In. Out. A flash of Amie‚Äôs face enters my mind. In. Out. Then, a flash of all three of us, snapping our first ‚Äòselfie‚Äô on my first crappy flip-phone. In. Out. I open my eyes, and I know what to do. Justice. Peace.

‚Ä¶

No sleep, but my mom left about a half pot of coffee behind this morning. I fill a black thermal to the brim, take a big gulp, add a splash of creamer, snap the lid down, and head out the door. I‚Äôve got to catch Kit before she goes into school; it‚Äôll be too hard to pull us out once we‚Äôre in. My text is still on delivered, so she‚Äôs probably sleeping till the last possible second. Her dad will drop her whenever she says she‚Äôs ready to go; he‚Äôs never in a rush. She‚Äôll be late enough, she may not even check her phone before she‚Äôs already in class, if she remembers to grab it at all.

2 miles of dirt roads, 1 mile of pavement, then I‚Äôm locking my bike to the bars outside the west school entry. She always uses this door; her first class is the first door on the left from here. Conveniently, I can stand behind the evergreens on the south side of the double-doors and call her over without her dad spotting me, then we can keep hidden walking to the football bleachers- the closest hiding spot I could think of.

My plan runs smoothly, for once, but the hard part hasn‚Äôt begun.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, Coco? I mean, I‚Äôm totally cool with ditching, but what‚Äôs with the secrecy?‚Äù Kit asks with a chuckle, but also with slight concern, as we‚Äôre yards from the field.

I pull her beneath the bleacher stairs. I‚Äôm pretty sure no one‚Äôs around here at this hour, but here we are when we‚Äôre not supposed to be, so better safe than sorry.

‚ÄúI love you. I have your back no matter what, just like you‚Äôve always had mine. What I‚Äôm about to tell you is one of the hardest things you‚Äôll ever hear, but you need to hear it from me, and we can deal with it together. I‚Äôve got you, okay?‚Äù I try to say confidently but softly.

Her eyes are locked with mine, a slight mist filling both pair.

‚ÄúI found an earring of Amie‚Äôs outside your house, and there‚Äôs just several other details that point toward‚Ä¶ I think you and I should go to the cops and tell them everything we know, together. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, I probably am, but at least then‚Ä¶ we can help clear your dad‚Äôs name.‚Äù It all comes out of my mouth a little too fast.

There‚Äôs a full river running down both of her cheeks now, but her eyes are still fixed with mine. I see the pain in them, the sadness. I see a look of defeat and a look of grief.

I just don‚Äôt see a look of surprise.

The stare continues, tears streaming down both our faces now, pain and rage continuing to fill both, but I‚Äôm the only one with the look of shock. Her, not an ounce. In this moment, we have no words.

What feels like a lifetime later, she whispers ‚Äúhe‚Äôs my dad‚Ä¶‚Äù

She drops her gaze and walks past me, on to class. I hear one last thing she mumbles under her breath.

‚ÄúI thought I got everything.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúBecause of you, we found his DNA on the earring you showed us, along with Amie‚Äôs. They dug and found enough evidence of her; he‚Äôs going down for this. You brought your friend and her family some peace.‚Äù He was a young member of the Payne County department; I‚Äôm pretty sure his dad‚Äôs been there a long time.

‚ÄúAnd the other girls?‚Äù I asked him, quietly.

‚ÄúWhile we don‚Äôt have anything yet to connect him to the other four girls missing here, his DNA did match cases from crime scenes 18 to 19 years ago around the Texas A&M University area. Tom went to school there. Three cases, three young women killed, he matched them all. Guess he wasn‚Äôt as smart back then, technology just wasn‚Äôt so smart yet either. Anyway, we‚Äôre getting him for those too. He‚Äôs gone for good, Collette. You did good.‚Äù His badge says ‚ÄòAndrews‚Äô.

¬†‚ÄúDo you think he‚Äôs done these things this whole time‚Ä¶ since then?‚Äù The question made me nauseous to ask out loud.

‚ÄúIt seems to us that when he met Cindy, you know, uh, Kit and Tommy‚Äôs mom, he quit for a while. Maybe he was happy and didn‚Äôt feel the urge, maybe her getting sick triggered it again, we don‚Äôt know for sure- just know the FBI agents used the word ‚Äòdormant.‚Äô Kind of weird to think about‚Ä¶ kind of like a snake. Anyway, you‚Äôre young and smart; 15 years old and solving a crime for cryin‚Äô out loud. You‚Äôve got your whole life ahead of you. You don‚Äôt have to worry about this stuff anymore, kid. Time to move on.‚Äù A smile, a pat on the shoulder, and a slight nudge towards the door; Andrews was done with me, the whole department was; everyone, really. Case closed.

But, I think that word will stick with me; dormant- like a snake, lying perfectly still until the timing is right. He‚Äôll shed the layer of skin he‚Äôs been wearing- his disguise, his armor- and emerge from his hiding place; yellow eyes and a mischievous grin.

## What is Shift +100 Amrix?

Shift +100 Amrix is an **automated trading platform** built to help both beginners and experienced traders take advantage of real-time market data using AI. Think of it like a co-pilot for your trading journey ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt just give you signals; it can execute trades for you based on settings you choose.

The platform covers a wide range of assets ‚Äî from **cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum**, to **forex pairs, stocks, and even commodities**. It‚Äôs designed to analyze market patterns, identify profitable trade opportunities, and place trades faster than a human could manually. This is similar to platforms like Immediate Edge and Bitcoin Code, which use algorithms to reduce emotional decision-making and improve efficiency.

In a nutshell, Shift +100 Amrix wants to make trading smarter, faster, and easier ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre not a full-time day trader.

## Who Created Shift +100 Amrix?

The creators of Shift +100 Amrix are a bit of a mystery ‚Äî which, let‚Äôs be honest, is pretty common in this space. While there‚Äôs no big-name founder plastered on the homepage, it's believed to be developed by a group of **fintech professionals and AI engineers** who‚Äôve worked on similar platforms.

That said, the platform seems to be modeled after established automated systems like **Bitcoin Era** and **Bitcoin Code**, suggesting the team behind it has experience with algorithmic trading tools. The system‚Äôs stability and uptime reflect that it‚Äôs not a weekend project from some random coder.

Still, I‚Äôd love more transparency about the team. A public-facing founder or lead engineer would definitely boost credibility.

The Man Who Started The Apocalypse. It sounded like a bad joke.

It all started with a persistent letter in my mailbox. Like I said, it wasn‚Äôt like I believed any of it at all, and given the many stories and myths I had debunked‚Äîthis one might have been the most outlandish of them all.

My recent blogs, I‚Äôll admit, have run dry of the kind of reality-bending horror stories that once brought this account to life‚Äîit was a cruelly slow process of watching my blog lose the life that once made it so enjoyable.

It‚Äôs been 7 whole days since I‚Äôve even had anything in my mail. 

But I didn‚Äôt want to be like other creators, taking up on unbelievably contrived clickbait stories‚Äîno, that wasn‚Äôt the kind of journalist I am‚Äîso it took me exactly 72 letters in my thirsty mailbox, a river of bills I could no longer sail away from‚Äîand the irritable urge to just get it over with to finally take this story in. What could be so urgent, so important that it simply must be broadcasted to everyone worldwide?

This.

The Man Who Started The Apocalypse didn‚Äôt knock. In his head, he was already in the living room, and ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what mattered for now‚Äù. You will come to find that he‚Äôs very cryptic; he would hide major information, yet still over-exaggerate less relevant ones.

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù I encouraged, by the time I had realized he was standing outside the door for twenty minutes. ‚ÄúMake yourself comfortable‚Ä¶here.‚Äù

I tried to not pay attention to the weird mixture of relief and confusion on my dad‚Äôs face as I finally brought in a subject after three months of idleness. My dad, still not over the fact that I‚Äôm over 18 and yet still in his house, stood by the door protectively‚ÄîI guess the parental instincts never switched off.

It was more than often a deranged lonely man, or old lady, would see things that weren‚Äôt there. Some even got violent. My dad has seen them.

‚ÄúHere, do you want tea or anything?‚Äù I offered. For those of you who may have watched my interviews before, this was but a dirty trick‚Äîa trick to get my subject as comfortable as possible before the real questions begin. Questions yielded best results when the subjects didn‚Äôt believe they were revealing anything. Although, I think this was one of those cases where the subject wanted nothing but sharing their story.

The Man Who Started The Apocalypse was eerily silent. Matter of fact, his mouth appeared to be full of whatever drink I could possibly offer him.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù I cleared my throat after setting up the recorder, ‚Äúyou know why we‚Äôre here today, I‚Äôm sure.‚Äù

The Man Who Started The Apocalypse was still just as silent.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶uhm so, why don‚Äôt we refer to this questionnaire‚Äîa little practice here and there, just to break the ice? You agree?‚Äù

He nodded so subtly, that I may have not caught it, if I had been looking down at my paper for a millisecond. His mouth was full of something, now I was sure of that, because his jaw constricted his movement.

‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶so, I‚Äôll take that as a yes.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt move an inch.

‚ÄúYeah, uhm anyways,‚Äù I continued, ‚Äúif you could tell our listeners what your name is‚Ä¶maybe so people have a context to who you are?‚Äù I tried my best to keep the patronizing tone out of my voice.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I urged again, when he continued to hold his silence. ‚ÄúYour name?‚Äù

It looks as if I had been the one who was sending spam mail begging for my story to be heard. I was hardly getting any information, and I worked hard to keep my calm. I was supposed to be coaxing reactions out of him, not the other way around.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the name you‚Äôve registered here, so would you mind if I let the listeners know what it is? Of course you could‚Äî‚Äú

Cough. Cough. 

I finally learned what it was that he had in his mouth when he spat it on my living room table. It was blood. My stomach turned. I‚Äôve always had a low tolerance for blood. And now it was spreading in a nice, circular pattern on the table. 

I think if there was ever a time where my disbelief started wavering, it was at that point. Something in me cringed like it was infectious waste. Something in me had registered the fear of the moment, even when I had tried so hard to keep it down.

‚ÄúHey! Hey!‚Äù I cried. ‚ÄúShit! I‚Äôm gonna need to wipe that off‚Ä¶.hey, are you okay?‚Äù

He was still violently coughing up more blood, and I rushed for a glass of water and a tissue. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶I am alright‚Ä¶I suppose‚Ä¶.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶let me get that in just a‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúNO!‚Äù he screamed. I looked up. ‚ÄúNo, no, no, no, no‚Ä¶.no. Don‚Äôt you dare do that.‚Äù He physically got up, and took the tissue from my hands.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean? You spat on‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúYou CAN‚ÄôT do that,‚Äù he croaked desperately with all the strength he had left. ‚ÄúYou just can‚Äôt. You must not‚Ä¶you can‚Äôt‚Ä¶.no‚Ä¶.no, no, no‚Ä¶‚Äù

All the professionalism I had been trying to maintain evaporated. ‚ÄúAnd why should I listen to you? You‚Äôve barely said a word since you came in, although you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs been sending hundreds of applications in my mail‚Ä¶.for months. And now you‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúBecause this is how the apocalypse starts.‚Äù

Finally. Something I could work with. ‚ÄúHmm? What do you mean?‚Äù I pressed.

The Man Who Started The Apocalypse sighed as if this was already common knowledge. ‚ÄúYou wipe that table off, you mess with the timeline. Then the apocalypse wont start.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy should I want the apocalypse to start?‚Äù I asked. I am guilty now to admit, that some childish part of me had wanted the apocalypse to start. I‚Äôd wanted to be important. Special. The one who told the story first. Maybe finally, I‚Äôd have a good piece to report for this week of my blog. Something more than the usual missing dog flyers and coffee shop reviews nobody read. Something real.

It was the kind of want that begins when you feel too small for the world you‚Äôre in. When your life has gone quiet for too long, you start confusing noise with meaning.

I just wanted a story.

‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt,‚Äù he said simply. ‚ÄúBut you would mess with things that were supposed to happen.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not making any sense,‚Äù I grilled. ‚ÄúIf ‚Äòthe apocalypse‚Äô already started, then how would it ‚Äòstart‚Äô now?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can tell you about that.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Finally,‚Äù I huffed.

‚ÄúBut first I need to tell you about this plant.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat plant?‚Äù This interview was going off track, and I knew it was the sign of a weak reporter to let it. But trust me, this time you shall not be disappointed.

‚ÄúThe one in my garden,‚Äù he said sadly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had much of a green thumb‚Ä¶I was victim to a deep procrastination that paralleled my love for these plants. I know this is very ironic, since literally my job is to cut trees for lumber‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúVery funny indeed,‚Äù I agreed miserably. I couldn‚Äôt see the point of this.

‚ÄúBut the love was there,‚Äù he insisted, ‚Äúand it was why I‚Äôd find myself with a new packet of seeds by the end of each week.

‚ÄúOh I would so love watching them grow, grow‚Äîfrom the seed to a delicate seedling. But that was when the interest usually died out. I would forget about them for weeks and weeks on end, only to return to their dried remains by the end of the month.‚Äù

This conversation was going awfully off track. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see how this is possibly related‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúBut then there was this plant,‚Äù he continued like I had not spoken at all. ‚ÄúMy friend had given it to me, and believe me‚Ä¶it was so easy to take care of. Didn‚Äôt ask for much water, didn‚Äôt care it was growing in the side of the wall with no sunlight‚Äîit was one tough plant. It took only three days for it to sprout from a seedling to a fully-grown plant.

He was so engrossed in his story, it was like he was talking to himself. ‚ÄúAt first I didn‚Äôt take much notice of it but‚Äî‚Äú

I had to redirect this conversation right now. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúBut this plant was special!‚Äù he cried out with such emotion in his eyes. He was slowly working himself into a fit thinking about some plant. Maybe my dad was right, I had one of the loonies instead.

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I patronized, ‚Äúbut‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúOnce it has grown to full height, it would call out my name every single day, every single hour of the night!‚Äù he spat fiercely. I could still see the blood-streaked spit on his lips. ‚ÄúIt was a beautiful curse! A beautiful curse I had knowingly‚Äîeven lovingly‚Äîput in my garden. I could not keep my eyes from it for one whole day without becoming severely unhappy. 

‚ÄúAnd God was it so full of life, so beautifully lush and green, with long slender branches and frilly edible leaves. They looked so edible, that as the days went on‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm gonna have to cut you off here‚Äî‚Äú 

‚Äú‚Äîthat as the days went on, I turned more and more animalistic!‚Äù he persisted frantically. ‚ÄúI wanted to eat it!‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if you ate it?‚Äù I resorted to humoring him, exasperated.

His face darkened with fear. ‚ÄúNo, no I could never do that. I could never‚Ä¶.I could never bear to try‚Äîthat plant was the only thing that resurrected my garden back to life.‚Äù

‚ÄúBack to life?‚Äù I laughed at his obsessive ramblings. This was already turning out to be one of those interviews I would never look back on, and discard away as ‚Äònot even being halfway reasonable‚Äô. ‚ÄúBack to life you mean‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúBack to life I mean as in back to life,‚Äù he said so solemnly. ‚ÄúAll the dead stems, all the dead branches I had neglected‚Ä¶they rose back to life. They were now just as lush and as beautiful as my plant was.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay so‚Äî‚Äú I began, ready to debunk whatever story he had cooked up. Most of them just wanted the extra buck, I couldn‚Äôt blame them, but this one was going too far.

‚ÄúYou can believe whatever you want,‚Äù he said serenely. ‚ÄúBut this plant saved my life. Being a lumberjack meant that I was so used to taking the lives of many trees, so used to the cold of destruction‚Ä¶but this plant taught me life again. It restored the life in my house, the life in my garden‚Ä¶the life in me!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it must have, but today we‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt bear to kill it off!‚Äù he exclaimed, nearly exploding into the tears that collected from his emotional reaction. ‚ÄúEven when it grew eyes and weird bulbs, I just-I just couldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNow you‚Äôre just reaching,‚Äù I scoffed.

‚ÄúI am telling the truth.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSure you are,‚Äù I said sweetly. ‚ÄúNow if you could just tell us, what does this have to do with The Apocalypse?‚Äù

‚ÄúHm?‚Äù

‚ÄúI said,‚Äù I repeated, ‚Äúwhat does this plant have to do with The Apocalypse?‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything,‚Äù he replied as if this was an obvious fact. ‚ÄúThe whole world is a garden now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, ‚Äòthe whole world is a garden now‚Äô?‚Äù I pressed.

‚ÄúI mean, the whole world is a garden now. It spread. Like infection.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I nodded sarcastically. ‚ÄúIf you could just elaborate on that, I‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great thing,‚Äù he said dreamily. ‚ÄúNature is fighting back. I‚Äôm finally gonna pay for my crimes against her‚Äîthe whole of mankind is. This plant is beautiful in its persistence against the parasite man is. If it weren‚Äôt for‚Äî‚Äú

This was the first time I had looked at the pool of blood on my table that I had avoided wiping‚Äîavoided looking at. My heart sank, and I lurched back on my chair.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?!‚Äù I screamed. ‚ÄúWhat did you do to‚Ä¶to my table?‚Äù

The Man Who Started The Apocalypse was oblivious to the horror that‚Äôs been growing on my dad‚Äôs living room table. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù he asked innocently.

This can‚Äôt be real, this can‚Äôt be real. No no no no no‚Ä¶.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something‚Äîit‚Äôs growing on the‚Ä¶.on the table‚Ä¶.‚Äù No, this wasn‚Äôt real, and I was going to go out with my friends, tell them what a real piece of work I had talked to‚Äîwe‚Äôd laugh at how they got crazier and crazier by each interview.

Things like this don‚Äôt happen. And it grew exactly as fast as he said it would, it happened exactly the way he said it would happen. He‚Äôs drugged my tea. Or the air I‚Äôm breathing‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know how but he must have. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

‚ÄúGoddammit there‚Äôs a mother fucking plant growing on the table!‚Äù I yelled, waving my arms desperately. I needed to get up, I needed to get fresh air. ‚ÄúWhat part of this is hard to understand?‚Äù

He laughed‚Äîit was a horrible sound that escalated and escalated and grew into an inhumane high before it stoped. ‚ÄúAre you sure about that? Are you?‚Äù

It finally clicked. He was playing my game. I was the crazy one with the crazy story, and his belief depended on it. 

‚ÄúOh my God, yes!‚Äù I yelled desperately. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an ugly plant growing on the fucking blood you spat on! Oh my God, this isn‚Äôt happening, oh my God. I need to wipe this off‚ÄîI‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, don‚Äôt,‚Äù he said simply. The way he said it, it wasn‚Äôt just a warning, it was a sure truth. Something bad will happen. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unsafe.‚Äù

‚ÄúHell if I listen to you again‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúEveryone will die.‚Äù

I looked at him carefully. My eyes hurt‚Äîthe edges of my vision started blurring with one another. It must be the tea, he probably drugged my tea‚Ä¶

But how? My dad had been watching carefully from outside the room, and he hadn‚Äôt moved an inch since he got in. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúEveryone you know and love will die,‚Äù he said ominously. ‚ÄúYou will be infected. You have no idea what this plant can do.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat can this plant do?‚Äù My head was spinning‚Äîeither from the tea he couldn‚Äôt have drugged, or from the remains of the fear.

‚ÄúBad,‚Äù he replied calmly. ‚ÄúBad things.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why are you letting this happen?‚Äù

He looked at me sadly. He looked at me as if I was ignorant of something so important. ‚ÄúBecause nature is speaking to us. And you should never interfere with divine intervention. Do you believe in divine intervention?‚Äù

I kept quiet.

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù he said bitterly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so caught up in your facts and proofs and theories‚Äîthat you fail to see the magic in front of you. How can you be a journalist reporting ‚Äòthe truth‚Äô, yet hide from the truth many are afraid to stomach‚Äî?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe you should consider the fact that what you‚Äôre saying isn‚Äôt real,‚Äù I threw acid back, even though fear was growing in my body. ‚ÄúMaybe you should consider that you might not be right, and that this is some unexplainable alien phenomenon‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúOh this isn‚Äôt alien,‚Äù he corrected bleakly. ‚ÄúThis is very familiar. This is nature. The one you knew. This is the aftermath of the abuse you refuse to look at‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúEnough,‚Äù I interjected. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not explaining what this is, and why it‚Äôs happening‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúYou have to be okay with the fact that some things are better left unexplained, [redacted],‚Äù he stated quietly. I‚Äôve never heard my name spoken out loud before, not by people I didn‚Äôt have a close direct connection to. My dad knew the protocol‚Äîto not refer to me by my name when I had to interview someone‚Äîyet somehow the Man Who Started The Apocalypse knew.

‚ÄúHow did you‚Äî?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can tell you about that,‚Äù he reassured calmly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just so‚Ä¶hungry. Do you have food I can‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine, but you better explain‚Äîwhat happened to the floor??‚Äù

The floor had folded neatly into an impossible V-shape. The furniture was somehow magically glued to the floor, also adhering to the V-shape the floor had morphed to. It was unreal, and this was when I knew I was far gone.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt notice it,‚Äù he warned quickly, before all the furniture started sliding into the valley of our floor. It was like our awareness of the impossibility of the situation removed whatever glued this reality together, and now it was all coming apart.

‚ÄúShit,‚Äù he grumbled, ‚Äújust get the food, we‚Äôll be fine. And‚Ä¶try not to notice it.‚Äù

A million protests rose to my tongue, but I knew he was right. The less I paid attention to this madness, the less damage occurred. I got out of the room‚Äîmy dad was also glued to the floor, blissfully unaware of the impossible V-shape it had bended to‚Äîas I climbed over the kitchen counter to make whatever PB and J sandwich I could muster.

Holding my balance, I returned to a nightmare. It was one of those moments, I wished I could just come back and not walk in to a moment. I think I really need some sleep. I started counting my fingers. Five.

This can‚Äôt be real.

An impossible darkness had covered the whole living room‚Äîyes it was midday‚Äîand there were plants everywhere. Left and right.  I couldn‚Äôt see them, but I still knew they were there. I could feel the vitality radiate off of them‚Äîthe lush life that The Man Who Started The Apocalypse had described. It was still my living room, but the vegetation had taken over‚Äîalmost like a parasite.

‚ÄúHe-hello?‚Äù I called out to the darkness. ‚ÄúDad? [Redacted]? Are you there? Hello? What‚Ä¶.what is happening?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too late now,‚Äù the Man Who Started The Apocalypse croaked. ‚ÄúThe whole world is a garden now. You‚Äôre gonna be saved, don‚Äôt worry. Just‚Ä¶just try not to touch the plants.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funny,‚Äù I retorted, but still shied back from them. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre everywhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúBurn!‚Äù I heard my dad screech, and a relief overcome my body. ‚ÄúBURN IT. BURN THE PLANT. WE NEED TO BURN THE PLANT AND STOP THIS MADNESS!‚Äù

He ran through the dense vegetation to the center of the living room. The living room table. The gnarly plant that was growing from the blood. The beginning of all of this. 

And he flicked on a lighter.

For a split second, I saw the plant‚Äôs leaves recoil from the licking flames‚Äîan instinctive response to harm. And then all the vegetation and darkness disappeared from the room. The floor had returned back to normal. My brain hurt as if returning from a hangover. Something occurred to me.

‚Äú[Redacted]?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù he responded.

‚ÄúWhat does the plant do?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mentioned that the plant does bad things. I‚Äôm asking, what does the plant do?‚Äù

He pondered for a moment. ‚ÄúIt‚Ä¶it makes you see things. Things that are not real, things that can‚Äôt be real! But they feel as if they are.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow does the plant achieve this?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have a theory,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs not really for sure. I think it is most likely releasing spores that also work as a hallucinogen and it may be‚Äî‚Äú

I felt a glimmer of hope. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the chance that, maybe something like that is happening? That this is all a hallucination?‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you stopped for a moment to think that, maybe you‚Äôve already been stuck in a hallucination?‚Äù he asked gloomily. ‚ÄúMaybe what you thought was ‚Äòthe real world‚Äô wasn‚Äôt so real after all?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not‚ÄîDad?‚Äú

Like a game settings loading into real life, the dark forest glitched back to reality as well. I turned to see if my dad was still burning the plant or not. His aim had hovered to the right, and he was just pitifully burning the empty air.

It makes you see things.

This plant was protecting itself. 

I cut through the jungly vegetation to stop this. ‚ÄúDad? Dad? Listen to me, you‚Äôre burning it the wrong way‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù My dad responded angrily. ‚ÄúHere, look! I‚Äôm burning the plant! I know I‚Äôm old, but you cannot call me that old‚Äî‚Äú

‚ÄúNo, Dad, look!‚Äù I tried again desperately. ‚ÄúThis is where the plant is. You burn it‚Ä¶here.‚Äù My dad was too far gone. It was like trying to get a sleepwalking person to see the fact that they‚Äôre not in bed anymore. Futile. Pitifully stupid.

‚ÄúWatch his hand,‚Äù the Man Who Started The Apocalypse warned. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt touch it!‚Äù

A nasty overgrown vine had risen from the plant, and was slowly eating at my dad‚Äôs hand. No, it was worse than that, it was merging. Through all the gnarly eyes and pus-filled bulbs, it was hard to tell where the plant ended and my dad‚Äôs hand started. The lighter had been absorbed into the yucky, green nightmare that was slowly sucking my dad in.

My dad was blissfully unaware of it. It was like he was asleep with his eyes open. For him it looked like he was high up in heaven.

I remembered how I used to wake my Dad up every Saturday to teach me biking. He would never wake up from what we called his ‚Äònight of the dead‚Äô. But even then, he would still wake up at the last call‚Äîa ‚Äúyes, I‚Äôm alive!‚Äù to reassure my worried self. And now at this cruel time, that was all I needed.

But it never came.

‚ÄúDad! No no no! Dad wake up. Dad wake up, we need to go!‚Äù The tears slowed my voice to a whisper.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs too far gone,‚Äù The Man Who Started The Apocalypse said. It was a nice replacement for what he really meant. My dad was dead. 

‚ÄúWe need to go,‚Äù he urged. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch him, he‚Äôs infected.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad! Dad! Dad, please wake up,‚Äù I pleaded. ‚ÄúPlease, wake up, wake up, wake up. We need to leave‚Ä¶.before this plant eats you, Dad, you need to listen to me. Wake up‚Ä¶‚Äù

I was dragged outside past a dark forest of vegetation, as I watched my dad become fully consumed by this alien plant nightmare. The more horrific events happened, the easier it got to believe that this was just a nightmare. The benefit of the doubt? I had to erase all remains of it‚Äîbecause this was not real. No, can‚Äôt be.

This was just a nightmare.

‚ÄúDo you believe me now?‚Äù The Man Who Started The Apocalypse asked as he dragged us outside to the day. If I thought my living room was a dark forest, this was a whole new planet. 

Rainstorms gathered near intense overgrown trees‚Äîtrees that went at least an impossible 15 meters high. Their trunks were bloated with a black rot, splitting in some places to reveal wet, pulsing bark that looked too much like flesh. 

There were barely any humans, just carcasses of what they used to be. 

They weren‚Äôt people anymore. They were living greenhouses‚Äîhosts for something older, crueler, and patient.

Some of the humans moved, though movement is too kind a word. They staggered, dragged their feet through‚Äîlike they were carrying a whole tree inside of them. And this tree would poke out of one of their orifices. Some had it grow out of their ears, the others were completely blinded by the branches that poked through their eyes which once saw‚Äîbut now was just weeping pollen.

The deeper into this nightmare you went, the louder the wind screamed‚Äînot a howl, not a whistle. It sounded like breathing. A forest that exhaled. And it‚Ä¶.it was watching us.

‚ÄúOh my dear, look!‚Äù I heard a lady‚Äôs voice scream in delight, and relief. ‚ÄúBarney dear, look! She‚Äôs one of the normal ones! She‚Äôs not infected. Now we can finally call the emergency services and deal with this‚Äî‚Äú

Humans, humans love their normal. Anything that‚Äôs familiar brings them great comfort. It was an old instinct, to be washed with such relief when you meet what‚Äôs familiar. Because back in the cave days, it had meant safety. For the first time in my life,  I understood what my ancestors meant.

I wished I had relished in that small moment of normalcy before I turned around.

It had once been a sweet old lady with her husband, alright. But they weren‚Äôt anymore. 

She stood still smiling. Her arm‚Äîthe one that had once held her cane with such pride‚Äîwas now a twisted, bark-covered limb. The fingers had fused together, nails stretched into splinters, and small green leaves grew from her wrist like jewelry made of thorns.

Still, when she spoke, her voice was sugar-sweet. The kind of voice that had once offered tea and warm cookies. 

‚ÄúBarney, why aren‚Äôt you saying anything, darling?‚Äù she asked, turning her head just slightly towards her husband. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve found other survivors, they‚Äôre like us.‚Äù

Barney stood with his spine forced unnaturally straight, his eyes leaking tears he didn‚Äôt seem aware of. A thick sapling had burst through his throat and up through the roof of his mouth. It stood out, proud and leafy, like a terrible second neck.

He tried to move his lips, but no words came out. It was like the plant had taken his voice.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gone quiet again, Barney dear,‚Äù she smiled as if trying to pretend it was just one of his silly moods again. ‚ÄúYou always do this when we have company.‚Äù

She gently patted his hand with her good one. ‚ÄúOh don‚Äôt mind him, he was the one who‚Äôs been pestering me about finding company.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù I breathed as I held my mouth in horror.

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù The Man Who Started The Apocalypse agreed sadly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, we‚Äôre no better than they are anyway.‚Äù

It was at that moment I looked at the Man Who Started The Apocalypse. Properly looked at him. Without the effect of the spores, or no hallucinations. I looked at him with complete and utter acceptance of whatever nightmare he was also stricken by.

‚ÄúOh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Are you‚Ä¶are-are you okay?‚Äù His leg‚Äîthe right one‚Äîhad split open at the calf from pressure. Something had grown in there. Not a bone, not muscle.

A trunk.

It sliced through the skin like it had been growing for years, not months, pushing flesh aside as easily as parting weeds. Veins wrapped around the stump like ivy, quivering under the surface of what used to be his skin.

I finally understood why we‚Äôd been walking so slow. His foot barely touched the ground anymore.

‚ÄúI walk easier when I can‚Äôt see it,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúYou should try not to see it too. The hallucinations can be your ally.‚Äù

It occurred to me so simply. I looked down at myself as well.

And for a second‚Äîjust a second‚ÄîI almost believed I was fine. My hands still looked like hands. My shoes still had laces.

But then I saw it.

My sleeves had darkened‚Äînot with blood, but with something sticky and black, seeping up the fabric like roots drinking through cotton. It wasn‚Äôt much. Barely there.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel anything,‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúYet.‚Äù

I stared at the dark patch spreading up my arm. An eerie calm possessed me. ‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù

‚ÄúA week,‚Äù he answered with the same blankness. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs different for everyone. Some people go fast. Others‚Ä¶it‚Äôs like the tree takes its time. Sips instead of eat.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe ones who panic‚Ä¶they blossom too fast.‚Äù He reached for the disease my hand was. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt look, you can walk a little longer,‚Äù he reassured.

I stared at him. ‚ÄúAnd go where?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you see all of this?‚Äù he motioned to the air. ‚ÄúPeople have been living in this nightmare, believing they were in the real world. Believing they weren‚Äôt infected. The spores do that. They keep you locked into an imagined reality so it can feed. On you.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo I don‚Äôt go anywhere,‚Äù I said emptily.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúA lot of them are too far gone in their delusions, it‚Äôs sad watching them really. But some of them, like you, the infection isn‚Äôt as severe. So you try to wake them up‚Ä¶and maybe find a way to stop all of this madness.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you woken up any others?‚Äù

A sad smile told me he didn‚Äôt. Or even worse he had tried, and wasn‚Äôt successful. ‚ÄúThe infection catches up. I don‚Äôt have much time left.‚Äù

He fell to a collapsed tree beside him. The vines immediately snaked up to receive him, like a darkness that‚Äôs been waiting for its old friend. 

I noticed the way his ribs moved‚Äîshallow and forced, like he was fighting for every breath. Like the forest was already inside his lungs, deciding when to stop letting him breathe at all.

‚ÄúI thought I could do more,‚Äù he croaked. ‚ÄúWarn them sooner. This is nature‚Äôs calling. No one believes the ones who see too much.‚Äù

The same blood-curdling cough rattled out of him. He covered his mouth, and when he pulled his hand back, sap and blood oozed between his fingers like saliva.

‚ÄúBut you still can,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still lucid. Still early. You still have you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to say,‚Äù I mumbled.

He grabbed my arm urgently as the coughing got worse. His fingers had already started to fuse together‚Äîbark, bone, and muscle twisting into something neither man nor wood. ‚ÄúWake‚Ä¶.them up. All of them.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if they don‚Äôt listen?‚Äù I asked, voice breaking. The time I had laughed at him felt so far away. ‚ÄúIf they just laugh at me? If they think I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs deluded?‚Äù

He smiled resignedly, like someone finally closing their eyes after a long, long day. ‚ÄúThen you‚Äôll tell them what I told you.‚Äù

I felt the weight of it before he said it.

‚ÄúThat you started the apocalypse.‚Äù

## What is Swap 4X Lasix?

Think of it as your digital co-pilot in the wild world of trading.

What got me interested was the claim that it uses **AI-driven real-time market analysis**, allowing users to make smarter decisions, faster. It‚Äôs also designed to be beginner-friendly, with some decent tools for more advanced users. So yeah, it‚Äôs not just another flashy interface with empty promises. There‚Äôs some substance here.

## Who Created Swap 4X Lasix?

As with many of these platforms, the **creators of Swap 4X Lasix remain anonymous**, which is both expected and a little frustrating.

From what I‚Äôve gathered, it seems to be a **collaborative project by fintech developers and algorithmic traders**, likely based in Europe. They‚Äôve clearly put some effort into building a platform that doesn‚Äôt just look good but actually performs. Still, a bit more transparency would go a long way in building trust.

This feature uses **AI and machine learning** to analyze market trends and patterns as they happen. It's not just showing you graphs‚Äîit‚Äôs telling you what they mean and what actions to take.

1k1ys13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1k1ys13/have_any_of_you_ever_cured_adrenal_fatigue/,Have any of you ever cured adrenal fatigue?,"I probably started having early symptoms of this, back in 2014. Where I'd come home, and my adrenals on both my sides would be in so much pain. My anxiety and stress would be like on 1000%, my sleep was getting worse at that time, I was starting to lose my cool personality and was becoming a big time complainer for some reason. 

Unfortunately at that time, I didn't really care to research health or get every lil thing checked at the doctor. I think that was a bad habit, that I picked up in my childhood home. That in recent years I've finally grown out of and look into everything, since I've damaged so many parts of my health. 

My way of dealing with stress back then. Was just coming home ordering some burgers, chinese food, cookies and ice cream. Then getting lost in a movie or show. See that could of possibly work, but there was one huge problem. I was a big time coffee drinker and that was putting hell on my adrenals. 

I remember a few years ago, in like 2022 or 2023. Just when I was about to end my caffeine consumption all together. I would often think to myself, ""why do I still buy this caffeine bullshit, it literally doesn't even give me energy"". Like it got to a point where I was just buying it out of habit or comfort. 

I eventually gave up all forms of caffeine. As after I stopped coffee, I was doing matcha and the energy drinks. Then once I cleaned up my diet and found out abour adrenal fatigue. It all came back to why I always felt like absolute shit. 

I haven't got this officially tested. But hoep I can get a referral to see the endocrinologist. As I recently found out it's levels to this, and I've had it for so long. Where the pain is really bad on my left side. And I worry it may have advanced to maybe a tumor. 

But before I can get to see an appointment for this. I've just been working on doing what I can. Adding salt to all my water, continuing to eat very clean bland and healthy. The only thing I can't fully control is the high adrenaline or stress. As I live in one of the most stressful cities in the world, being NYC. Where it's basically like a fever dream 24/7 here, I work a  highly physical job and a few other stressful aspects of my life. 

I'm really not sure when I lost a grip on things. As I used to be just the most laid back person you can imagine. Very reserved, but I was never extra or legitimately mad or annoyed by anything. Now most days is like fight or flight mode, but while feeling extremely fatigued. 

I feel like if I had would of never overdid the caffeine. Then it would of never got to this point. Also maybe if I had knew about things to balance me out. That weren't just the typical like weed, cigarettes or alcohol. Like if I knew about the gut microbiome and how it affects your mental or if I knew how to work on my sleep back then. Instead of trying to fix it with Zzzquil, which made things worse. 

So far outside of trying to fix my electrolyte issue. I'm trying to get into soaking baths at the end of a wired day, I've been taking Holy Basil for a while too. But for some reason, it's like my adrenals don't even feel that shit. I also can't take ashwagandha, due to thyroid problems that I need to get checked out. So any other routines or products that truly cured your adrenal fatigue? I'm tired of living in what feels like am alternate reality of myself, where I'm anxious, easily distracted and just not the chill person I used to be. ",3,1744959713.0,Supplements,3,1.0,False

- Once you‚Äôre comfortable, switch to live mode.
- The platform scans markets, finds signals, and makes trades on your behalf.

1k1ypks,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1k1ypks/lifting_a_coworker/,Lifting a Co-worker,"I recently put myself in an uncomfortable situation by helping a colleague out with lifts for 2 years.

I began working at a new company and learnered a colleague who didn't have a drivers license stayed close to me, so I began offering lifts so they didn't have to pay for transport.

 In return we split the petrol costs 50/50. I was quite happy with the situation and we spoke about them getting their license and driving in which meant one day we could split the lifting.

Fast forward 2 years later, my colleague has a license and car but refuses to drive in to work because they're too scared (40y/o) and still depends on me for lifts.

Whilst more than happy to split the lifting 50/50, I've reached my limit of offering lifts in return for petrol money and I don't know if I am being a dick or if my frustrations are justified.

Over the passed 2 years of helping with lifts I have also had to deal with the short fall of this.

- some days my colleague is late, meaning I run late which adds to my stress on busy days

- I would sometimes have to go out of my way to fetch/drop them

- I would be asked to lift my colleagues friends, sometimes even when my colleague was not in the car

- we aren't ""friends"", some days they just get in the car and put their headphones on after 5/10mins

- i have to lead the conversation, and ask how their weekend was or what they did

- they sometimes bring their breakfast, leaving coffee cups and bowls in my car during the workday

- I was never offered a 'thank you' over and above splitting petrol 50/50. Whilst not expected, after 2 years offering a simple car wash voucher would've been an amazing gesture.

My colleague also isn't short for funds, they are more senior than me and earn more than me, along with being older than me.

Further to these direct short falls resulting from lifting I would feel taken advantage in these ways:

- Vehicle responsiblity is entirely mine ( maintenance, insurance, risk of accident etc), this comes without lifting them in but the 50/50 lifting would've allivated some of this on my side.

- I lost me time, I didn't have flexibility anymore, I couldn't go into work early if I had a heavy workload, I would have to let them know far in advance if I was sick so they could make a plan and most of all i couldn't relax during my 2 hour commute due to constantly having my work colleague present.

I have now changed this by saying I have other commitments before/after work and can no longer offer lifts in order to not ruin our working relationship.

My hope is they will soon start driving their own car in and then I can offer a 50/50 lifting situation so it is 100% fair on both sides.

Am I being a dick or am I justified?

Aside from being brutally honest, would you have handled the situation differently to not ruin the working relationship?",1,1744959442.0,coworkerstories,2,1.0,False

This question is really about food. We are both vegetarians. I know we are not going to get Indian food, which is the best cruise line for vegetarians? 

I don't remember any details from our first cruise, lot of things may have changed. I know we have breakfast, lunch and dinner for free in the main restaurant, but is that all? I want to be able to go to a restaurant any time of the day, whenever I feel the pangs, and order something to munch(pizza, sandwich, fries, onion rings, coffee) and not having to pay for it. Essentially free food any time of the day. Is there something like that?

1k1ylkc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1k1ylkc/how_to_deal_with_severe_procrastination_problems/,How to deal with severe procrastination problems?,"

- I noticed this pattern 

I procrastinate everything literally everything, since i was a kid i was literally unable to study way before a test or take the trash before it compiles and my mom gets so mad at me i would never do my homework in time i‚Äôve always done it in class or on my way to school i would never be able to do things without procrastinating even if i have to go to the bathroom i won‚Äôt go until i really can‚Äôt hold it in anymore.. but at the end of the day i‚Äôd do these things, even if i‚Äôm late but the fear factor and urgency is what made me study one day before the exam and do good or finish up my homework before the teacher walks in or take the trash out after my mom scolds me or go to school early before the bell rings and like i have never never ever not been late to meeting my friends or attending something even if i was awake early i‚Äôd stay in bed and procrastinate getting up until I‚Äôm actually late so now i‚Äôm like ‚Äúoh fuck i really gotta get up‚Äù


Now that i‚Äôve grown up and there‚Äôs not much scolding and fear factor available it‚Äôs more severe and I‚Äôm losing my sense of urgency 

Sometimes it‚Äôs bad to the point i can‚Äôt leave the bed or eat for hours and sometimes just be in bed the whole day and unfortunately being addicted to my phone doesn‚Äôt help it feels like I‚Äôm paralyzed in a sense i‚Äôve gone days without even showering sometimes like it feels so hard to do it for some reason when i break my routine 

Building a routine helps me but it‚Äôs like the start of building a routine in something that i have procrastinated is so hard when i can just distract myself and tell myself i‚Äôll do it eventually and the longer i procrastinate about it the harder it is to do it.. like praying for example or studying 


After procrastinating studying for so long and i‚Äôd say i‚Äôll study but i always delay until the exams come and i can‚Äôt finish what i have to study in time i‚Äôd feel soso horrible but after seeing that i have an option (redoing the exam again) i‚Äôd distract myself and procrastinate again.. now i have failed my senior year 4 times because of this pattern and it‚Äôs only recently until i started to pay attention to how bad this habit is 


And like you have no idea about the extent i‚Äôd go to procrastinate like I‚Äôd always get away with it

Like telling my brother he can test if i studied or not 

And then not leaving my room the whole day so i don‚Äôt have to be tested because i didn‚Äôt study and i can never admit that like i‚Äôd go so far into manipulating my own people

And in my head it‚Äôs like ‚Äú if this day just passes without me having to deal with i gotta deal with tomorrow will be fine‚Äù

And then tomorrow comes and it‚Äôs like a never ending cycle 

Even my attention span is so bad i noticed this when i started taking private math classes, I‚Äôd literally without paying attention just zone out and then suddenly gain back my focus and realize how i‚Äôve been not paying attention and it freaks me

I forget too much literally my family tease me about it all the time and doesn‚Äôt trust me with things because they know how low my attention span is

I‚Äôve lost and accidentally broken soso many things 

I forget the stove turned on so much i burnt the kitchen one day while no one was at the house and if i didn‚Äôt wake up and saw that the whole house is full of smoke the whole house might‚Äôve burnt

If someone tells me to do something I‚Äôd forget it immediately like if my dad says can you make me a cop of coffee i‚Äôd turn the kettle on and forget about it every time 

If someone tells me their name after ending the convo i literally always forget it like i can‚Äôt remember a recent time where someone told me their name and I‚Äôve remembered it 

If i for example checked something on a tap on my phone i‚Äôd forget sometimes like after closing it and then go back to it again and then i also forget it and maybe check 3 times like always double checking.. and rereading things, i know this is too much to consume but these are also the littlest thing that i be suffering with and it frustrates me

And my sleep schedule is always horrible so i feel like i even have less time to do things and the day goes by without doing anything 

And i literally can‚Äôt remember the last time i made myself go asleep without being very sleepy so i‚Äôd just doze off i even can‚Äôt sleep without stimulants like listening to something while im sleeping or watching something 




But it‚Äôs just recently that i‚Äôm tryna hold myself accountable for these things and trying to keep myself busy so i feel like I‚Äôm actually doing something important and being sharp is my top priority because my parents are spending a lot of money on my private classes and before my private math classes i could literally never open a book so it did help and made it easier for me to study even tho i still procrastinate and study 2-3 hours before the teacher comes 

Sometimes i really can‚Äôt focus while studying like stuck in a loop repeating something so easy but for some reason i can‚Äôt process anything and it makes me really really frustrated 


I wanna be sharp and i want to stop forgetting things and be able to focus without being in my mind so long and i want to stop procrastinating and be responsible 

Because i have so much internal motivation but it doesn‚Äôt match my physical actions

I‚Äôve become so emotional numb.. it‚Äôs sad

And i‚Äôve also developed a very addictive behavior to things that distract me from everything ",4,1744958979.0,AskMen,5,1.0,False

Chapter 1: Limburger, My Lovely

Right before the telegram came, Hicks McTaggart was nursing a Schlitz in the back booth of the Dairyland Lounge, squinting through cigarette smoke at a mural of cows frolicking under what looked suspiciously like an art deco moon. Some joker had scrawled a mustache on the Holstein nearest the grain silo. Outside, Milwaukee heaved its late-autumn breath‚Äîsoot, sauerkraut, the stale funk of factory steam‚Äîand the Polish kids across the street were selling counterfeit almanacs, ‚Äúguaranteed 100% more accurate than God.‚Äù

The message, when it came, arrived via Western Union boy dressed like a gangster‚Äôs nephew‚Äîpinstripes, pomaded hair, pistol-shaped bulge in his coat that turned out to be a squirt gun loaded with horseradish. Hicks tipped him with a Susan B. Anthony dollar he claimed was cursed and read the slip:

""M TAGGART STOP URGENT NEED TO LOCATE ONE IONE PRZEWALSKI STOP POSSIBLE DERAILMENT OF FAMILIAL DAIRY EMPIRE STOP LAST SEEN HEADING EAST IN DIRECTION VAGUE STOP CAUTION ADVISED STOP CHEESE STAKES EXTREME STOP""

He read it twice, folded it into a paper airplane, and lobbed it into a puddle of Schlitz on the table.

""Guess we're off again,"" he muttered, to nobody but the cow mural, whose eyes now looked less bovine and more conspiratorial.

The trouble with heiresses wasn‚Äôt the money, it was the direction they tended to run‚Äîeast, always east, like something in them was magnetized toward bad poetry and worse governments. Hicks had seen it before. Jazz girls gone Slavic. Heiresses finding enlightenment on the steppes. Sons of Midwestern butter barons joining avant-garde puppet troupes in Prague. He should‚Äôve smelled it coming.

\-------------

# Gemini:

The Milwaukee sky, the color of a bruised plum, hung low over the Schlitz brewery, its familiar yeasty tang doing little to sweeten the sour taste of '32. Hicks McTaggart, nursing a lukewarm Blatz in a booth at O'Malley's, watched the rain smear the neon shamrock in the window. Repeal was a whisper on the wind, a promise as flimsy as a flapper's dress strap, and already the boys were talking about shifting focus. No more busting heads over brewery strikes; now it was straying wives and vanished inheritresses, the kind of domestic squabbles that paid in dimes instead of dollars and smelled faintly of face powder and regret.

His cigarette ash, a fragile grey tower, finally succumbed to the tremor in his hand. Another case file lay on the sticky tabletop: Eleanora ""Nora"" Chancelor, age 21, presumed fond of scenic routes and unsupervised funds. The photo clipped to the cover showed a young woman with eyes that seemed to look right through the lens, a faint, almost mocking smile playing on her lips. Wisconsin cheese money, the kind that piled up like snowdrifts in January, and she'd just up and vanished. Wandered off like a goddamn cheesehead in a fog.

The summons had come that morning, delivered by a kid with a runny nose and the weary eyes of someone who'd seen too many evictions. A Mr. Abernathy, starch in his collar and suspicion in his gaze, wanting Hicks to find her, bring her back. Routine, Abernathy had insisted, the kind of milk run to keep the lights on. Hicks had almost believed him, right up until the point Abernathy mentioned the steamer ticket. One-way. Destination: somewhere east of the horizon.

\-------------

# DeepSeek (first attempt):

Milwaukee, 1932. The kind of cold that cracks sidewalks and morals alike.

Hicks McTaggart‚Äôs office smelled of stale rye, cheaper ink, and the ghost of every bad decision he‚Äôd ever pinned to a corkboard. The cheese heiress‚Äôs photograph stared up at him from the desk, her smile a dare. Runaway, the file said. But runaways leave trails‚Äîgum wrappers, pawn tickets, the odd stocking draped over a park bench. This dame had vanished like a fart in a windstorm.

The client‚Äîa man with a face like unbaked dough and a suit that screamed ""trust fund via slaughterhouse""‚Äîslid a check across the desk. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in Budapest. Maybe.‚Äù

‚ÄúBudapest,‚Äù Hicks repeated. The word hung in the air like a dislocated shoulder.

Somewhere below, a streetcar screeched. Somewhere above, God adjusted His suspenders and chuckled.

Outside, the city was a jigsaw puzzle missing half its edges. The Depression had turned even the pigeons into skeptics. Hicks pocketed the check. It was either this or sell his kidneys to a doc who‚Äôd probably ice him for the other one mid-surgery.

Ah hell, he thought. At least Hungary‚Äôs got pastry.

\-------------

# DeepSeek (second attempt):

The ice on the Milwaukee River hadn‚Äôt so much thawed as given up, collapsing into the water like a defeated chess king. Across the street, the Kosciuszko Savings & Loan displayed a sign in its soot-streaked window: CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE OR DIVINE INTERVENTION, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST. Inside the adjacent building, behind a door with a pebbled-glass pane that read MCTAGGART ‚Äì INQUIRIES, Hicks sat staring at a stain on his desk shaped like the former Austro-Hungarian Empire.

The stain had been there since ‚Äô28, when a client‚Äîa Lithuanian accordion repairman with a nervous condition‚Äîslammed a mug of kvass down mid-sob. Now, Hicks measured his life in stains. The coffee-ring Weimar Republic on the filing cabinet. The mustard-blast *Battle of Tannenberg* near the coat rack. And this one, Franz Joseph‚Äôs ghost in linseed oil, reminding him that empires end with a whimper, but desk varnish lasts forever.

Outside, a newsboy shouted something about Al Capone‚Äôs tax troubles. Inside, the radiator hissed like a disgraced alchemist. Hicks lit a cigarette. The matchbook had a drawing of a walrus wearing a crown on it. He didn‚Äôt remember where he‚Äôd gotten it.

Somewhere in the city, a cheese heiress was learning to yodel. Somewhere beyond that, a ship‚Äôs horn groaned toward Lake Michigan. Hicks exhaled. The smoke curled into the shape of a question mark. Or maybe a Hungarian folk-dance notation. Either way, it vanished before he could decide.

\-------------

# Claude:

The rain in Milwaukee that April made everything bleaker than usual, if you could imagine such a thing in 1932, with bread lines stretching around corners and men in too-thin coats huddled under awnings, smoking hand-rolled cigarettes down to nubs that singed their yellowed fingertips. Hicks McTaggart watched them from his second-floor office window, letters peeling off backward on the glass: INVESTIGATIONS‚ÄîDISCREET & PROFESSIONAL. He'd almost added ""& REASONABLE"" but people looking to hire someone like him weren't usually being reasonable, and his rates sure as hell weren't.

The knock came three taps, hesitant, like most clients who found their way up his stairs. Hicks swiveled, watching the door. ""It's open,"" he called, not getting up. The bourbon in his desk drawer would have to wait.

She wasn't what he expected. The fur coat was real and recent, the shoes Italian leather beneath the spatter of spring mud. Wisconsin cheese money, old money, the kind that survived even when the rest of the country had gone to pieces.

""Mr. McTaggart? My name is Elspeth Gruenwald."" No handshake offered. ""My father believes you might be of service in a... family matter.""

Gruenwald. Even Hicks, who couldn't tell Limburger from Liederkranz, knew that name. Gruenwald Artisanal Dairy Products. Six counties' worth of pasture, twelve processing facilities, and if the rumors were true, connections to certain Chicago enterprises that kept the milk and money flowing even when the law wasn't looking the other way.

""Family matter,"" Hicks repeated, measuring the words. In his line of work, that usually meant someone had gone and done something stupid. He pulled a notepad across his blotter. ""Tell me about it, Miss Gruenwald.""

She glanced at the window, then back at him. ""It's my sister. She's... disappeared.""

# Copilot:

Hicks McTaggart had seen more than his share of strange, but this was a first‚Äîwedged between crates marked *Danish Butter* and something ominously labeled *Agricultural Implements*, with only a fraying poker deck and a half-empty bottle of something he couldn‚Äôt pronounce keeping him company. A whimper of accordion music drifted in from the corridor, hesitating as if uncertain of its own key, only to be drowned out by the clatter of bootsteps approaching fast‚Äîtoo fast for comfort.

He checked his watch, though it hardly mattered. The world outside his particular confinement was running on some other clock, one that ticked to the rhythms of unseen transactions, coded messages tucked into the seams of ill-fitting suits, and the occasional bullet speeding toward destinations unknown. Hicks sighed, lifted the bottle, and took a slow, thoughtful sip.

Somewhere between the ports of Hamburg and Budapest, he had lost track of the heiress, and possibly also of himself.",0,1744958884.0,ThomasPynchon,4,0.22,False

Still, always remember: **trading has risks**, and no platform can guarantee profits. Use the tools wisely and don‚Äôt invest more than you can afford to lose.

The minimum deposit is **$250**, which is pretty standard for automated trading platforms. This amount unlocks full access to the platform, including live trading and broker integration.

1k1yi43,https://www.reddit.com/r/omad/comments/1k1yi43/nicotine_lozenges_enabled_me_to_do_omad/,nicotine lozenges enabled me to do OMAD,"Apparently, the Native Americans chewed tobacco to curb hunger back in the day.

Have tried OMAD a few times in the past. Always caved after a few days because wasn't able to tolerate hunger.

Decided to try nicotine lozenges this time. I've been able to sustain OMAD for about a month now (lost around 8 lbs in a month). I find that the nicotine makes hunger bearable.

My routine (in case it helps anyone):

\- wake up early-ish (around 8am) and drink a small cup of black coffee with a dose of L-Theanine (for alertness).

\- drink only water all day. suck on a nicotine lozenge all day until 6pm.

\- at (or after) 6pm I eat the meal of the day. Consisting of 2 phases. Phase 1: thirty grams of whey protein with some Fiber One fiber cereal and milk. Phase 2: some chicken or ground-beef dominant meal with peanuts. I find the peanuts help with pooping the next day. Must be the oil or something.

That's it. Very simple lifestyle. Don't feel unbearably hungry. And have lost 8 lbs in a month.

It took a while for the burn to get started. Partly because of momentum (probably), and partly because I eat a lot. But it's started a couple of weeks back and the fat is definitely melting off.

I also avoid industrial seed oils (olive oil is fine), soy, sugary soda/pop drinks.

It takes a lot of work to undo the abuse we've visited our body. I must have had a 100 Little Caesar's pizzas between the Covid lockdowns and today (there's a Little Caesar's joint next to my house). It's going to take a lot of pain to burn the fat from that abuse of my body.

Going to keep on going on. Hope to lose another 11.5 lbs. But if I just lose another 6.5 lbs, I'll be in the normal weight category per BMI.

Don't lose hope. Keep going. Get a couple good workouts a week, and a good night of sleep every day.

The greatest benefit of OMAD has been this raw hunger to do more with each day.",0,1744958598.0,omad,2,0.5,False

# Where Does This Magic Happen?

All the training is online, so you can learn from your couch, your kitchen, or your local coffee shop. Plus, this isn‚Äôt just for local deals‚Äîyou‚Äôll learn how to **do deals virtually in any market**. Joe and his team close deals in Alabama and Mississippi while living in Arizona and Missouri. So yeah, you can definitely make this remote lifestyle work.

# When Can You Start?

Immediately. Once you're in, you get access to the modules and tools to get rolling. Joe‚Äôs method doesn‚Äôt rely on slow traditional marketing, so if you‚Äôre ready to take action, results could come in weeks‚Äînot months.

# How Does It Actually Work?

Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

* Use MoJo and other tools to build call lists.

I mean the Neville goddard followers can be gullibe but many of them can't be that dumb yes?

So why is it that the law of attraction community in general and Neville goddard community in specific not use it for huge things and then post proofs of that?

Like - There will be many posts of manifesting a ""free coffee"" but if manifestations work why stop at that? why not manifest free food three times a day everyday so that u can survive without a grueling job?


Why manifest a job that pays 1000$ more when u should be able to manifest having millions of dollars without the need of getting up from.your bed?


One can say that doesn't appeal to many people and they might genuinely like working and ""earning"" but seriously? off the millions of people that visit these communities not one have had the pretty common dream of not working???


Even the ones who post manifestation result are like - ""hey look I manifested this appartment by the beach"" but when I hit them up in the dms to dig deeper they were just like- yeah I have been working and saving for years and I was like- How is that manifestation when u would have got that apartment anyways??

It would have been more impressive as a proof of manifestations if u had been unemployed and then landed a free beach facing apartment!!!!


How many people have done that on the subreddit by the way? Post clear tangible proofs of actually miraculous things like-manifesting millions of dollars without breaking your back for it, manifesting being a prodigal genius  instead of a random A grade in a random school test, manifested a critically acclaimed research paper to their name we can look up.on google that could do service to humanity , manifested such great looks that they are a very followed social media star or a model???


Think about it millions of people subscribe to the loa and Neville goddard subreddit and the answer is zero. 0.


Vast majority of proof posts are limited to benign stuff like- Look I manifested a black crow on my window , or a rainbow , or a few 100 dollars that I recieved at the month end after working the whole month.

IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ANYWAYS.

But I do realise the appeal of following it because we inherently want the universe a sentinent apathetic being to care for us, for there to be some meaning behind this all- that is why the masses follow belief in religion or witchcraft or black magick or **manifestations**.

The cold prospect that the universe doesn't really care about you and in the grand scheme of life u either have to grind it way to a life worth living if u r poor or middle class or make peace with the unfairly tough hand u r dealt with,  because the universe never owed u shit heck it never even notices u r here to begin with.",8,1744958120.0,NevilleGoddardCritics,4,1.0,False
1k1ycx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineWorkFinder/comments/1k1ycx0/honest_remote_jobs_online_with_flexible_work/,Honest Remote Jobs Online With Flexible Work Arrangements,"Exploring Honest Remote Jobs Online with Flexible Work Arrangements: Opportunities and Benefits
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Discovering Genuine Remote Work Opportunities

In the current digital age, more people are searching for honest remote jobs online that offer flexible work arrangements. The appeal is clear: the ability to tailor work schedules around personal life, reduce commuting stress, and embrace a better work-life balance. However, with so many job listings online, distinguishing between legitimate roles and scams can be challenging.

Honest remote jobs are positions offered by reputable companies or trusted platforms, providing clear job descriptions, fair compensation, and transparent hiring processes. These roles allow you to work from home or anywhere with an internet connection, often with flexible hours that suit your lifestyle, making them highly attractive for parents, students, caregivers, or anyone seeking more freedom in their daily routine.

### Popular Categories for Legitimate Remote Work

When exploring remote jobs, it helps to focus on industries and roles that commonly embrace flexible arrangements. Here are some fields where you can find honest remote work:

- **Customer Service:** Many companies hire remote customer support agents to handle inquiries and assist customers via phone, chat, or email.
- **Writing and Content Creation:** Freelance and full-time writing jobs, including blogging, copywriting, and editing, are often remote and flexible.
- **Virtual Assistance:** Virtual assistants provide administrative help to businesses, managing emails, scheduling, and data entry.
- **Technology and IT:** Positions like software development, web design, and IT support frequently offer remote arrangements.
- **Teaching and Tutoring:** Online education has grown, with roles for tutors, language instructors, and course creators.
- **Sales and Marketing:** Digital marketing, social media management, and remote sales roles are increasingly common.
 
### Benefits of Working Remotely with Flexibility

Honest remote jobs with flexible conditions provide several key benefits that improve both your professional and personal life:

- **Time Freedom:** Set your own hours or select from options that fit your daily routine, making it easier to manage commitments and hobbies.
- **Cost Savings:** Avoid expenses related to commuting, work attire, and eating out.
- **Location Independence:** Work from anywhere‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs your home, a coffee shop, or a different country.
- **Reduced Stress:** Flexible schedules help reduce burnout and improve mental health by allowing breaks when needed.
- **Improved Productivity:** Many remote workers find they concentrate better without office distractions.
 
### How to Identify Legitimate Remote Job Listings

While many genuine remote roles are available, the online job market can be flooded with scams. To protect yourself and find trustworthy opportunities, follow these tips:

- **Research the Employer:** Check company websites, LinkedIn profiles, and reviews on platforms like Glassdoor.
- **Avoid Upfront Payments:** Legitimate jobs don‚Äôt ask you to pay for training, software, or a background check.
- **Clarify Job Details:** Get a full job description, work expectations, pay rates, and contract terms before committing.
- **Use Reputable Job Boards:** Search through trusted websites specializing in remote work such as FlexJobs, Remote.co, and We Work Remotely.
- **Verify Contact Information:** Be cautious if communication occurs solely through personal email accounts or instant messaging apps.
 
### Tips for Thriving in a Remote Role with Flexibility

Landing an honest remote job with flexible hours is just the beginning. To succeed and enjoy the benefits, consider these strategies:

- **Create a Dedicated Workspace:** Set up a quiet, distraction-free zone to help you focus and separate work from leisure.
- **Establish a Routine:** Even with flexibility, maintaining some structure in your day helps build discipline and meet deadlines.
- **Stay Connected:** Regularly communicate with your team and supervisors to foster collaboration and stay in the loop.
- **Prioritize Self-Care:** Take breaks and move around; remote work can blur the boundaries between work and rest.
- **Keep Learning:** Enhance skills and adapt to new tools or processes to remain competitive and open to more opportunities.
 
By focusing on honest remote jobs online with flexible work arrangements, you can find meaningful employment that fits your life‚Äôs rhythm while building a rewarding career. Take the time to research carefully, apply smart strategies, and embrace the freedom that remote work can provide.

</div>How to Identify and Avoid Scams When Seeking Flexible Remote Work Opportunities
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Spotting Red Flags in Remote Job Listings

When searching for honest remote jobs online with flexible work arrangements, vigilance is key to avoiding scams. One of the first warning signs is a job posting that promises unusually high pay for minimal work. If it sounds too good to be true, it often is. Legitimate employers rarely offer exorbitant salaries upfront without assessing your qualifications.

Another red flag is poorly written job descriptions filled with spelling mistakes, vague responsibilities, or missing company details. Real companies provide clear, detailed information about job roles, expectations, and their contact information. Be cautious when the employer‚Äôs email comes from free domains like Gmail or Yahoo instead of a company-specific address.

Your Gateway to Legit Work-From-Home Jobs: https://app.leadcreator.ai/fxludjx0p7  
  
Scam postings might pressure you to pay upfront for training, software, or background checks. Legitimate remote jobs never ask for money to start working. If you are asked to make any payment, walk away immediately.

### Verifying the Credibility of Remote Work Opportunities

To protect yourself, research the company thoroughly before applying or accepting any offer. Visit their official website and check for contact details, office locations, and social media presence. Genuine companies usually have a consistent online footprint and employee reviews on platforms like Glassdoor or LinkedIn.

Your Gateway to Legit Work-From-Home Jobs: https://app.leadcreator.ai/fxludjx0p7  
  
You can also search for the company's name along with terms like ‚Äúscam‚Äù or ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù to find any negative reports. Don‚Äôt hesitate to call their listed phone number or email HR for clarification if something feels off. Authentic employers want you to feel confident and informed about your role.

Networking within remote work communities is another smart move. Forums, social media groups, and websites dedicated to remote work often share user experiences and warn about scams. The insight from real workers can be invaluable when deciding which opportunities are trustworthy.

Your Gateway to Legit Work-From-Home Jobs: https://app.leadcreator.ai/fxludjx0p7  
  
### Understanding Offer Details Before Committing

Before accepting any remote job offer, scrutinize the provided contract or agreement. Legitimate contracts clearly outline job duties, salary, benefits, work hours, and termination policies. Be wary if these details are vague or omitted.

If you receive an offer that requires immediate action or deposits your first paycheck before any actual work, be suspicious. Many scams use early paycheck promises to lure victims into providing personal or bank information.

Your Gateway to Legit Work-From-Home Jobs: https://app.leadcreator.ai/fxludjx0p7  
  
Ask for references or previous employees if you‚Äôre unsure. A reputable remote employer will gladly provide contacts for you to verify their legitimacy.

### Protecting Your Personal Information

Keeping your personal and financial information safe is crucial in your remote job search. Never share sensitive data like your Social Security number, bank account details, or passwords early in the hiring process.

Your Gateway to Legit Work-From-Home Jobs: https://app.leadcreator.ai/fxludjx0p7  
  
Secure your devices with updated antivirus software and use strong, unique passwords for job platforms. Be cautious if an employer wants you to use your personal bank account to transfer money or manage payments. This is a common scam tactic that can leave you liable for fraudulent activity.

### Recognizing Common Scam Schemes Targeting Remote Workers

Understanding typical scams helps you stay alert. Here are common ploys to watch for:

Your Gateway to Legit Work-From-Home Jobs: https://app.leadcreator.ai/fxludjx0p7  
  
- **Fake check scams:** Employers send counterfeit checks for you to deposit, then ask you to wire a portion elsewhere. The checks bounce, but your wired money is lost.
- **Multi-level marketing pitches:** These often disguise themselves as job offers but mainly focus on recruiting others or buying products.
- **Data entry and processing scams:** Posting remote data entry jobs that pay per processed form but require upfront payments for ""software.""
- **Phishing attempts:** Fake job offers that request personal info to steal your identity.

### Tips for Finding Genuine Flexible Remote Work

To maximize your chances of landing an honest remote job with flexible hours:

- **Use reputable job boards:** Sites like FlexJobs, Remote.co, and We Work Remotely vet their listings carefully.
- **Apply directly through company websites:** This cuts down the risk of fraud often found on third-party listings.
- **Focus on established companies:** They usually have dedicated remote teams and transparent hiring practices.
- **Build your personal brand:** A polished LinkedIn profile and relevant experience increase employer trust.
- **Attend virtual job fairs and webinars:** These events frequently feature verified employers looking for flexible remote talent.

By staying informed and cautious, you can find flexible remote jobs online that are not only honest but also fit your lifestyle. Protect your time, effort, and personal information by confidently navigating the remote work landscape with these strategies.

### Conclusion

Finding honest remote jobs online with flexible work arrangements can open doors to a better work-life balance, increased productivity, and greater job satisfaction. These opportunities allow you to work from the comfort of your home or any location you prefer, adapting your schedule to fit personal needs. With the growing demand for remote work, more companies are offering genuine positions that value flexibility without compromising professionalism.

Your Gateway to Legit Work-From-Home Jobs: https://app.leadcreator.ai/fxludjx0p7  
  
However, as you explore these options, it‚Äôs crucial to stay vigilant and know how to spot potential scams. Being cautious about job offers that promise unrealistic pay, require upfront payments, or lack clear contact information helps protect you from fraud.

By doing your homework and following safety tips, you can confidently pursue authentic remote jobs that match your skills and lifestyle.

Ultimately, honest remote work with flexible hours is within your reach when you stay informed and proactive.

Tyler Herro put up a staggering 36 points, 4 assists & 3 rebounds in Miami's last encounter with Atlanta.

I'll be frank: I like Herro's chances of having another big game against a struggling Hawks defense ‚Äì a defense that allowed the Orlando Magic to bag 120 points off of them just a couple days ago. I won't be surprised if Herro crushes this prop in points alone, especially with elimination on the line.

Do you press a pod machine or call a 20‚Äëyear barista who can craft anything from a warehouse of beans and syrups? Today‚Äôs automation developers face the same choice.

Zapier and the like are so huge and dominant in the RPA/automation industry because they absolutely nailed **deterministic workflows**‚Äîvery well defined workflows with if-then logic. Sure they can inject some reasoning into those workflows by putting an LLM at some point to pick between branches of a decision tree or produce a ""tailored"" output like a personalized email. However, there's still a world of automation that's untouched and hence the hundreds of millions of people doing routine office work: the world of **dynamic workflows**.

Dynamic workflows require creativity and reasoning such that when given a set of inputs and a broadly defined objective, they require using whatever relevant tools available in the digital world‚Äîincluding making several decisions about the best way to achieve said objective along the way. This requires research, synthesizing ideas, adapting to new information, and the ability to use different software tools/applications on a computer/the internet. This is territory Zapier and co can never dream of touching with their current set of technologies. This is where AI comes in.

LLMs are gaining increasingly ridiculous amounts of intelligence, but they don't have the tooling to interact with software systems/applications in real world. That's why MCP (Model‚ÄëController‚ÄëProxy, an emerging spec that lets LLMs call app‚Äëlevel actions) is so hot these days. MCP gives LLMs some tooling to interact with whichever software applications support these MCP integrations. Essentially a Zapier-like framework but on steroids. The real question is what would it look like if AI could go even further?

Top tier automation means interacting with all the software systems/applications in the accessible digital world the same way a human could, but being able to operate 24/7¬†x¬†365 with zero loss in focus or efficiency. The final prerequisite is the intelligence/alignment needs to be up to par. This notion currently leads the R&D race among big AI labs like OpenAI, Anthropic, ByteDance, etc. to produce AI that can use computers like we can: Computer-Use Agents.

OpenAI's computer-use/Anthropic's computer-use are a solid proof of concept but they fall short due to hallucinations or getting confused by unexpected pop-ups/complex screens. However, if they continue to iterate and improve in intelligence, we're talking about unprecedented quantities of human capital replacement. A highly intelligent technology capable of booting up a computer and having access to all the software/applications/information available to us throughout the internet is the first step to producing next level human-replacing automations.

Although these computer use models are not the best right now, there's probably already a solid set of use cases in which they are very much production ready. It's only a matter of time before people figure out how to channel this new AI breakthrough into multi-industry changing technologies. After a couple iterations of high magnitude improvements to these models, say hello to a brand new world where developers can easily build huge teams of veteran baristas with unlimited access to the best beans and syrups.",5,1744957624.0,AI_Agents,0,1.0,False

Just to set expectations, I'm a pretty standard coffee drinker without super high-end demands, mostly looking for convenience and decent coffee. I recently bought the new Philips Baristina espresso machine.

However, something puzzles me about the built-in grinder: according to the information available (and looking at the design), it seems like there's no procedure or even a way to access the grinder burrs/chamber for cleaning.
This seems unusual compared to most dedicated grinders or other bean-to-cup machines where regular cleaning is usually recommended to remove old grounds, oils, and fines to maintain taste and performance. Even for a regular user, I'd expect some basic maintenance.

So, my question is: Why doesn't the Baristina require or allow grinder cleaning?

Is there a specific design feature that makes it unnecessary? Does it purge itself effectively?
I'm curious about the reasoning behind this design choice and if it might impact long-term performance or taste due to potential buildup, even for everyday coffee enjoyment.
Has anyone else looked into this or found any official explanation from Philips? Any insights or theories would be appreciated!

Thanks!",1,1744957339.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

* Purdue (i was flabbergasted‚Ä¶)

Thoughts:

Everything was going good until USC on 3/26 lol‚Ä¶.

It was nice to have a 8/9 UC sweep but kinda sad that I went 4/16 in RD but I shouldn‚Äôt expect anything ü•≤. I‚Äôm def not the strongest writer so i think a part of the reason i got rejected from most of the private schools is because i came off as bland or uninteresting idk

I‚Äôm mostly really disappointed that I didn‚Äôt get into berkeley cmu upenn or cornell, especially because they were my more realistic reaches. esp upenn because i was legacy üò≠. Im grateful i got waitlisted at cmu and cornell, but now that i visited ucla at bruin days im pretty much not considering them. Although I‚Äôm really grateful for UCLA, I‚Äôm still really jealous of those who have multiple great options on a similar level, whereas I only had one really obvious school. But I‚Äôm excited to be a bruin esp bc of the weather and supportive culture!

reflecting on my application process‚Ä¶ start early! I wrote my Harvard and Columbia supps day of so yea lol. also i regret not applying to more schools like mit or caltech because i got scared‚Ä¶ but in hindsight i really wish i just shot my shot since i am a pretty nerdy person and would've enjoyed the campus culture. also i realize my ecs probably seem really basic but i genuinely enjoyed most of them",10,1744957261.0,collegeresults,5,0.92,False

The kicker is we are about 2.5hrs apart and want to meet about halfway which would be the Modesto area. We are also willing to branch out to nearby areas as well. Since this is some commitment, I'm planning to do more than just a simple coffee meetup. 

What are some fun/romantic activities out in Modesto? I haven't really been to the area before. Any tips and recommendations are much appreciated!",5,1744957178.0,Modesto,1,1.0,False
