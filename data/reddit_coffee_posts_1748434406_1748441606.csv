I told my manager on Monday what happened, took a day off and decided to WFH for the rest of the week.

The next week, manager pulls me aside for a coffee and asked why did I joined the monthly tax update meeting online instead of in person. He did not ask if I was okay but instead told me to “get over it” before quickly changing the subject. “It” meaning my doggo’s death. He told me it was important that I show up at least 60% every single week to build team connection and synergy regardless of what is happening in my personal life. 

I have been mulling over what happened and am baffled by what was said. It sounded so cruel at that time. I could not say anything back at that time as I was in shock. 

Should I just let this go and treat it as a momentarily mess up or is this a red flag please? Am I being overtly sensitive because of my grieve?

Thank you so much. 🐶🐾",2,1748441389.0,auscorp,0,1.0,False

I started my Substack 8 months ago with a dream: to write deep, soul-shifting essays that would inspire the world.

So far, I’ve published 5 articles. But I’ve left 2475 comments on other people’s Notes that say things like:

“🔥🔥🔥”
“This really made me think… about lunch.”
“You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take – Wayne Gretzky – Michael Scott – Me, probably.”

Here’s my strategy:

1. I follow literally everyone.
2. I reply to Notes at 2 AM when my judgment is weakest.
3. I post inspirational quotes with zero context like: “Pain is just weakness leaving the email list.

My first 3 subscribers were me (I used burner emails).
Subscriber #4 was my mom. She unsubscribed the next day because she said my notes were “aggressives.”
But I didn’t quit.

Last week, something incredible happened:
I hit 12 subscribers.
One of them even liked a Note. They might’ve been trying to bookmark it, but I’m counting it.

So what’s the takeaway?

Post relentlessly.
Engage blindly.
Mistake any attention as proof of destiny.

If you found this helpful, consider subscribing to my Substack: “Probably Not Worth Your Time.”
Or actually don’t. Honestly, that would be the most valuable thing you could do.

Ah, I’ll reply after I schedule 86 Notes about how coffee is a metaphor for ambition. See you later!",2,1748441324.0,Substack,0,1.0,False
1kxi0zy,https://www.reddit.com/r/azumanga/comments/1kxi0zy/sakakis_day_out/,Sakaki’s Day Out,"It was a beautiful spring morning with cherry blossoms in full bloom, as Sakaki, the quiet girl who used to attend Class 3, rose and stretched after a long night’s rest. She usually spent her weekends alone as she wasn’t known to be outgoing and social, unlike Kagura, who was always seen hanging out and laughing with others.

As she pushed her cat themed blanket away and slid into her comfy pink slippers, an old Christmas gift from her mother, Sakaki strutted through her bedroom. She sat down at the mirror on her worn wooden desk, its edges chipped with age. She began combing her long, black hair gently but precisely, quietly humming to herself.

She began thinking about Maya, the wild mountain feline she had encountered years ago on a school trip, and wondered how much he had grown since then. Chiyo, now a teenager, was still taking care of him, as Sakaki struggled to find her own place to live, and her parents were both allergic to cats.

Once she was done, Sakaki went to her wardrobe and dressed in something casual, not too attention grabbing, but very comfortable.

When she looked presentable, she made her way downstairs to the kitchen. She put two slices of bread into the toaster, grabbed a magazine she had left on the counter the day before, and began flipping through it. Sakaki was alone today; her father was at work, and her mother was out grocery shopping.

Once her toast was ready, she spread it with strawberry jam and began eating while reading. As she turned the page, a colorful, flashy advertisement for a cat cafe called Cafe Nyanko caught her attention. Her eyes widened with excitement as she scanned the page for the address. It was only a few blocks away. Without a second thought, she grabbed her shoulder bag and ran out the door, toast still in hand.

When she arrived at the cat cafe, she saw several Bengals, Siamese, and Ragdolls roaming freely while attendants served coffee and tea to customers.

Sakaki was completely mesmerized. She had never seen so many cats in one place before. “This is amazing,” she whispered, her face pressed to the window as she took in the sight. An attendant at the cafe noticed her and went outside to greet the shy girl.

“Hi! Welcome to Cafe Nyanko. Would you like to come inside?” the attendant asked enthusiastically, making Sakaki slightly flustered.

“Ah… I’d like to, but… my parents are allergic,” Sakaki replied nervously, fidgeting with her fingers.

The attendant nodded sympathetically. Just then, a young Bengal wandered outside, brushing against her legs and meowing softly.

He noticed Sakaki kneeling down and extending her hand. Without hesitation, he walked over to her and let her pet him, purred quietly.

“Your fur reminds me of Maya,” she murmured, scratching the cat gently behind the ears.

After a few minutes, she let go, and the Bengal returned to the cafe, looking back at her one last time before heading inside to join his fellow feline companions.

“Thank you…” Sakaki said to the attendant.

“Not a problem. I’m glad you met one of our furry friends. Enjoy the rest of your day!” the attendant said, giving a final wave before returning inside and closing the door behind her.

Satisfied and content, Sakaki slowly walked back home, hands tucked in her pockets, a small smile forming on her lips. As cherry blossoms drifted down around her, she wondered if that gentle Bengal would remember her. Maybe one day, he and Maya could meet. The thought filled her with quiet warmth.",1,1748441287.0,azumanga,0,1.0,False

1kxi072,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kxi072/sf_when_the_storm_came_the_clinic_forgot_about/,"[SF] When the storm came, the clinic forgot about Bernard. The angels didn’t.","At seventy two, Bernard’s life had its quiet routine.

He awoke at first light, got dressed, and walked through the rising birdsong to the clinic. He was usually the first one there and said hello to Mary, the heavyset nurse with the kind face who worked the early shift. After checking him in, Mary would lead him to the small room on the side where she gave him a plastic cup containing the mixture. She made sure to watch him drink the whole thing. He understood why.

He ate breakfast at the diner four streets away. He avoided the nearby restaurant, since both times he went, he recognized faces from the clinic. He then walked back to his house, taking the long way for the exercise if he felt up for it. At home, he made a second cup of coffee, which he sipped while reading the local newspaper, focusing on obituaries and science news while generally avoiding the headlines. These days, they were mostly about the floods.

After a light lunch, Bernard would either rest or walk to the library. And then, around 3 or 4 o’clock in the afternoon, his real day would start. He would put on his overcoat and hat and start the slow journey to his favorite park bench. It was slow not just because of the distance but because Bernard stopped at the bakery along the way. At this point, five years into the routine, the bakers knew him well enough to have a white paper bag ready when the entry chime announced the arrival of the old man in the tattered hat. Inside the bag were crumbs and crusts and old bagels — edible items that would otherwise get trashed.

And then, feed in hand, Bernard walked up the winding road past Meer Street until he reached the overlook. A few street lamps marked the spot. Under them were a trio of park benches, spaced apart. In front was a small break in the trees, giving a clear view of the far-off distance. Hills and fields and sky.

The birds were already there by the time Bernard showed up. Most were pigeons, but there were also robins and a few brave sparrows that occasionally fought the bigger birds for crumbs.

As soon as he sat on the bench, Bernard reached into the bag and deposited approximately a third of its contents on the ground. This caused light mayhem, which he loved, and once it settled, he spent the next hour or so slowly tossing them the rest of the food. He never spoke to the birds, believing that animals of different species have much more effective ways of connecting than human speech — food, for one. Sitting in quiet proximity, another. After the meal, once they’d all flown off, many into the branches of neighboring trees, Bernard rose from the bench and started the trek home.

Some people feel lonely. Especially old people near the end of their life with no partner, children, or friends they see regularly. This was not the case with Bernard. In his eighth decade, all his meaning and company came from the small winged things that filled his afternoons.

Bernard’s house, a two-room bungalow, was on a street at the top of a small hill located in a tiny Appalachian town named for the sixth US president. The town was half-empty when he moved in, mostly on account of the pill-shaped poison, which grabbed deep on lots of the folks, but also because of shifting topographies in the mountains. These, when paired with heavy rainfall, created intense flooding in areas not located on high ascents. Bernard, who paid his rent with the last of his savings and scant government checks, had no idea when he moved in how lucky his home’s elevation would be over the years.

Although not many would call pre-formed celestiantism with elements of interventional transcendence luck. Goes back to something deeper, earned.

On a late spring afternoon, Bernard made his way down the hill after feeding the birds. The sky was grey and the air had that early summer punch. As he turned on Meer, there was a commotion from a yard. Two men shouting at each other, but Bernard could hear them over the sump pump one ran into his home. Until there was a pause in the vacuum, when he deciphered, “*SKY’S FIXING TO SPLIT. FIGGER IT CAN’T HURT TO GET HER OFF GRID.”*

This was news to Bernard. When he reached his home, he checked that day’s paper. No news of an approaching hurricane. The forecast called for rain, but it didn’t sound pernicious. But the next afternoon at the library, he checked two different papers, which cautioned residents of his town to prepare for an upcoming four-to-five day squall.

One article was especially scary. It quoted a professor of ecology who said, “If the rainfall exceeds eighteen inches, it can be damaging to the point of washing this whole town away.” Another article spoke about how a flood of water in town would do little to cleanse the stain left by “the previous flood, of hillbilly heroin and chemical compounds, whose ravages are still felt.”

On his walk back from the birds that day, Bernard drank deep the pre-rainfall stain of the weather. The sky was crackling, the heavens an opening menace.

He did all he could to prepare on short notice: he picked up enough food to last him a week, hoisted up the storm windows, which he’d only ever done once before, and then called the clinic to see if it was possible to get a few temporary take-home doses. They said they couldn’t do that, which he understood, but the emergency mobile clinic, a fancy term for the ambulance in the parking lot, was operating, and could he please confirm his home address? The voice on the telephone told him to expect a visit at 10 am.

The first day of the storm was just as brazen as predicted. Rain pounded his window and roof nonstop, with a sound so loud it was legitimately distracting. 10 am came and went, but the emergency mobile clinic never showed. He called the clinic, but he couldn’t reach a human; it seemed they had closed on account of the weather, which made sense, but also not really, since just the day before he was assured his dose would be delivered. Distraction became the thing on account of his growing nausea, and an ache in his muscles he knew well from previous times. He tried reading, then watching TV, then pacing, then napping, but none of it took. At 4 in the afternoon, he thought of the birds. He hoped they were okay and not waiting out the storm in hunger.

The second day was more of the same. No emergency mobile clinic, and an increase in nausea. There were still muscle pains, and goosebumps broke out on his arms and neck that wouldn’t leave for a few hours. Bernard spent most of that day indoors listening to the rain and watching it from the window. He made a box of macaroni and cheese and spooned it into his mouth as the world outside took a wildly runny turn. He turned on his TV. He thought of the birds.

That night, Bernard had a strange dream. He was in something resembling a supermarket, wandering the aisles. Past the produce, a purple-and-green faced being appeared to him. Its skin rippled in scales and small triangles took over much of its face. Large wings clanked off its back, beating occasionally, keeping it aloft. It didn’t speak, just hovered in the air, looking down at the small man. And even though it didn’t communicate in any way other than its presence, Bernard, in his dream, understood.

When he awoke, he decided, torrential weather or not, he would make it there that day. All morning, in between shudders and mostly dry heaves, he played out his plan. He would wear his slick raincoat and hat. He would be careful on the dirt steps up to the benches, since there was no handrail and it was all likely mud at this point. He would wear the old pair of workboots he still had from those two years he helped clear sites. The distraction was helpful against his pangs of withdrawal. A few times, he vomited, shocked the clinic would leave him like this. He telephoned them, but got no answer, and tried the bakery, but it was the same. Which made sense: it seemed like a great day to keep things closed. Luckily, he found some stale crackers in the back of the cupboard and a frozen loaf of bread in the freezer, which he took out to thaw. By 3 in the afternoon, he was both physically ready — with the right clothes, boots, and feed — and physically bothered — by the muscles pangs, nausea, and increasing lightheadedness. Thankfully the vomit had passed.

Bernard walked slowly, his feet tracing familiar steps, although the world was anything but recognizable. The ground was slop; even the road looked liquid. The trees banged and waved in the wind, broken limbs littered his path. He couldn’t see the sky or two feet in front of him, everything relegated to a grey-blue curtain of moving wet. His pants from the knee down were soaked within minutes, although his feet, torso, and head stayed toasty, as did the feed he had placed in three plastic bags, one in the other in the other.

Eventually, he reached the ascent that led to the lookout where he met with his birds. It took him nearly ten minutes to walk up the nine or so steps, which would usually take him all of thirty seconds. But he got up there eventually and saw the bench he sat on was still there. Sopping, but there. He couldn’t see the view, obviously, but it was clear that there was no bird anywhere in the vicinity. Of course not — was he an idiot? It was storming so bad, nothing was out, let alone the pigeons and sparrows he’d grown to rely on, even love.

Still, the old man took his seat on the bench, making sure to put the back of his raincoat under his butt so it wouldn’t get soaked. He sat there, feeling the rain pound his body until it gave way to the pounding of his skull and his being, wrung out in the harsh indifference of withdrawal. It was awful, hard, and the extremity of the outdoors offered little distraction. For a good few minutes, Bernard just sat there, suffering. It was such that he didn’t think he could make the return trip, not without tremendous effort. Maybe this was it. He put the bag of bird food on the bench beside him and lowered his stinging, cascading head into his hands.

For a few minutes he stayed like this, unsure of himself or how to chop through this pain.

And then, it was like there was a pause in the weather. Except that wasn’t true — the view from the bench was still obscured by the pouring, but it seemed like the rain had lessened around him. There was a fluttering to his right as a large thing settled. And then another to his left, and then a few more.

Bernard, head still lowered, turned, but only partially. The things beside him were not birds. This he could tell just by their presence, and even though in his dream he had seen a green-and-purple face, in this context, *in the reality of the bizarre moment*, he knew (*how? how did he know?*) that to look directly at the things near him would be like looking directly at the sun, but with a quicker snuff out.

Bernard sat on that bench, feeling the pause in the rain and the lightness (*no, that wasn’t the word, but the real word for the feeling didn’t exist, nor could it be found in a phrase or description or any method of communication)* as more and more of the winged things settled down all around him. They kept fluttering down — even though Bernard kept his head to the ground, it was impossible not to feel their arrival. Must have been a dozen of them, maybe more, all gathered silently near the old man who had made a habit of feeding the birds that tended to congregate here in better weather.

Time passed, slowly, but it was enough just to be near them. Plus, it was work to keep his focus on not looking, and the pain in his head was still a snare, the ache in his muscles going on like a runaway. Only… he opened his eyes after a long pause. He could feel the rain falling on him. He turned his head slightly. The thing to the right of him was gone. He turned to the left, and then looked behind him. They were all gone — which he knew because the pause in the rain was, too. But that wasn’t it — all the food in the plastic bags had vanished. This made Bernard smile more than anything.

Until he stood up. Because when he did, it was with a straighter back than he had in decades. His head felt surprisingly clear and his muscles felt spry like he was forty again. He walked back to his house through the rain in increasing steps of disbelief; not only were the pangs of withdrawal gone, gone entirely, but he couldn’t remember a time in his life when he felt better. It was uncanny, but no complaints.

The next morning, the fourth and supposed last day of the rainy ambush, the emergency mobile clinic showed up in front of his house just after 10 am.

Bernard went out to meet them. He smiled, waving broadly, and told them there was no need. They looked at him like he was nuts, but peeled off. By late afternoon, the rain had stopped, and although the world was drenched and turned to sloggy mud all over, he walked his boots back to the bench, holding a small bag of pretzels he picked up at the gas station’s On-the-Go Mart. He was glad to see it open again.

And when Bernard sat on that bench and a few birds came over to eat his offerings, he felt overjoyed, knowing something about them, something about himself that he doubted he could ever express, because how could you express that which you don’t understand? — but it was alright, it was enough just to feel.

Hours later, he walked home in the falling birdsong.

About 8 months ago I was in this weird funk. Like, everything was fine on paper but I felt like I was sleepwalking through life. Same job, same friends, same Netflix shows, same everything. I'd wake up and already know exactly how my day would go.

Then my lease ended and instead of finding another place in the same area, I just... didn't. Moved to a completely different city. Didn't know a single person there.

First few weeks were honestly terrifying. Had to figure out where to buy groceries, find new coffee spots, make friends from scratch. But something weird started happening - I felt more alive than I had in years.

Turns out when literally everything around you changes, you change too. I started doing stuff I'd never done before just because the old me wasn't there to say ""nah that's not really my thing."" Joined a hiking group (I hate exercise). Started going to poetry readings (I thought poetry was pretentious). Even tried making my own bread because why not.

The crazy part is how fast it happened. Like one day I looked in the mirror and was like ""who is this person?"" In the best way possible.

Now I'm not saying everyone needs to move across the country. But maybe try taking a completely different route to work. Go to events you'd normally skip. Read books that aren't your usual genre. Talk to people you wouldn't normally approach.

Your brain gets lazy when everything's predictable. Shake it up and watch what happens.

Three months in my new city and I've got friends I actually want to hang out with, hobbies that don't involve scrolling my phone, and I'm genuinely excited about stuff again.

He’s always been more of a tech guy—loves video games, coding, all that. So when he texted me back in March and said he was building a raised garden bed in his backyard, I almost spit out my coffee.

**“Since when are you into plants?” I asked.**

He said he just wanted to try something different—something that didn’t involve a screen.

**It Started with Tomatoes**

At first, he only planted a few tomato starters and a couple of herbs. He watched videos on how to build the bed, read a few forums, and basically winged it from there.

The first two weeks, nothing really happened. Then—boom. One morning, he found tiny green sprouts pushing through the soil. You’d think he won the lottery.

**The Unexpected Benefits**

Daniel told me the garden gave him something to look forward to each day—something small but grounding. He started waking up earlier to check on the plants. He even started eating better, since he didn’t want to waste what he was growing.

**One day he said:**

“I didn’t realize how much stress I was carrying until I had something peaceful to focus on.”

**It Was Never About the Vegetables**

By midsummer, his little garden was thriving. The tomatoes were sweet, the basil was out of control, and he even got a few peppers going.

But more than anything, Daniel found a new hobby that helped him feel better mentally and physically. Not bad for someone who once thought houseplants were too much responsibility.",1,1748441215.0,u_GwenSheltonn,0,1.0,False

It’s like your blood just boils instantly, even though you know it’s not exactly the end of the world. I had one of those moments the other day... I was just sitting there sipping coffee, and boom, instant rage. 🤯

Apparently, this isn’t just me being dramatic. There’s something called 'cognitive appraisal', which is basically how we evaluate a situation and decide what emotion to feel. When traffic is slow, I guess we’re already kinda annoyed because we’re not in control. So, when someone cuts you off, it's like the tiny spark that ignites a bigger fire. Our brains automatically tell us, ""This is a threat!"", even though rationally, it’s not. 

In my case, I guess it’s a mix of frustration and the feeling that someone’s breaking the unspoken road rules. Knowing the psychology behind it doesn’t fix the traffic, but maybe next time, I’ll be able to take a deep breath and chill a bit before turning into a road rage monster. 😂",1,1748441202.0,brainBehaves,0,1.0,False

I’m a 28-year-old single woman currently in Knoxville, TN, and I’m looking to relocate to a city that better fits this next chapter of life. I’m craving rootedness, walkability, and water access—but still want energy, community, and career opportunity.

🏖 Must-Haves

* **Nature**: Specifically **ocean or beach access**—not necessarily oceanfront, but I want a place where water is part of daily life.
* **Young-ish Population**: I’m 28 and single, so hoping for a city with other folks in a similar life stage and to potentially find a life partner.
* **Seasons**: I don’t need four dramatic seasons, but I do want **some change**—mild winters are fine, just not a year-long summer.
* **Size**: Needs to be **bigger than Knoxville** (\~190k).

🚶‍♀️ Nice-to-Haves

* **Walkability**: I’m okay with Knoxville-level walkability, so anything better is a win. Bonus for bike paths and walkable neighborhoods.
* **Higher Ed Scene**: I work in **higher education/social work** and would love access to universities or mission-driven orgs.

✈️ Bonus

* **Direct Flights to Memphis** would be great (family is there), but not a dealbreaker.

————

😬 Worries

* Was originally drawn to **St. Pete/Tampa**, but concerned about:
   * **Seasonlessness** (hot/humid all year but I do LOVE warm weather!)
   * **Transient/touristy population**
* I’ve done small cities before—**don’t want to feel stuck or isolated** again.
* California is too far, too expensive, and again seasonless similar to St. Pete/Tampa worries.

🌿 What I Want

I’m craving rootedness, walkability, and water access—but still want energy, community, and career opportunity. 

# 🏖 Must-Haves

* **Nature**: Specifically **ocean or beach access**—not necessarily oceanfront, but I want a place where water is part of daily life.
* **Young-ish Population**: I’m 28 and single, so hoping for a city with other folks in a similar life stage and to potentially find a life partner. 
* **Seasons**: I don’t need four dramatic seasons, but I do want **some change**—mild winters are fine, just not a year-long summer.
* **Size**: Needs to be **bigger than Knoxville** (\~190k).

# 🚶‍♀️ Nice-to-Haves

* **Walkability**: I’m okay with Knoxville-level walkability, so anything better is a win. Bonus for bike paths and walkable neighborhoods.
* **Higher Ed Scene**: I work in **higher education/social work** and would love access to universities or mission-driven orgs.

# ✈️ Bonus

* **Direct Flights to Memphis** would be great (family is there), but not a dealbreaker.

# 😬 Worries

* Was originally drawn to **St. Pete/Tampa**, but concerned about:
   * **Seasonlessness** (hot/humid all year but I do LOVE warm weather!)
   * **Transient/touristy population**
* I’ve done small cities before—**don’t want to feel stuck or isolated** again.
* California is too far, too expensive, and again seasonless similar to St. Pete/Tampa worries.

* A city that offers **both solitude and community through nature**

The scent of old coffee, grease, and half-finished protein shakes clung to the air. The canteen wasn’t glamorous—just a breakroom nestled between the locker rooms and the training ring—but to Ember, it felt like the heartbeat of the place.

She wasn’t just the new girl. She was the new girl.

Tall, flame-haired, and trained in underground circuits across Mexico and Japan, Ember had just signed her contract with SlamHouse Wrestling—a promotion known for its unfiltered energy, steamy backstage drama, and blood-soaked rivalries. Her ring name burned across her promo posters like fire: Ember Vyx.

She wore her persona like her gear—tight, daring, unapologetic. But here, off-stage, in the buzz of microwaves and vending machines, everything felt different. Intimate. Quiet. Dangerous in a different way.

“Didn’t think the new girl actually existed,” a voice said.

Ember turned. A man leaned against the vending machine, arms crossed. Ripped hoodie. Sleeves pushed up to reveal veins and calluses. He looked like someone who’d bled on more mats than he'd walked on carpet. Jax Ryder—one of SlamHouse’s roughest brawlers.

“Rumors said they signed a firestarter,” he added. “Didn’t expect you to look like that.”

Ember smirked. “Didn’t expect you to talk like that.”

Just wanted to share a few of my favorite spots in Dubai where I love to go and just be  no pressure, no crowds, just pure chill time. If you're looking for some quiet introspection or a peaceful escape, these are worth checking out:

 * Kite N Surf, Nessnass Beach: While it's a popular spot, the vibe here is surprisingly relaxed, especially during off-peak hours. I love grabbing a coffee from one of the small cafes and just watching the kitesurfers from a distance. The sound of the waves is incredibly soothing.

 * Mohammed bin Rashid Library: This place is an absolute gem. Multiple floors, quiet reading areas, and a stunning architectural design. It's easy to find a secluded corner to work, read, or just zone out. Plus, the view from the upper floors is pretty cool.

 * Zabeel Park: One of the city's green lungs. I usually find a quiet bench away from the main pathways and just enjoy the greenery, watch people stroll by, or read a book. It's a great escape from the concrete jungle.

Now, I'm hoping you all can help me out! What are YOUR go-to introvert-friendly spots in Dubai? Looking for more places where I can just sit, chill, and recharge without feeling overwhelmed.

These are a few things that helped me :

\- It's going to take longer for you to learn, so accept it, but don't be disheartened. 

\- Try to choose parents, friends, driving instructors (whoever you are learning to drive with) who are going to be patient and aren't going to damage your self-esteem when it comes to learning to drive. 

\- Choose a driving test location with a high pass rate and be willing to travel if you can. I chose Newtown in Wales, although I live on the other side of the country. Also, it's easier to find driving test cancellations in rural places. 

\- Try to book as many lessons in a short period of time as possible so you don't forget the skills you learnt when you start the next lesson. This is where a crash course/crash course-like lesson arrangement might be helpful.

\- If you are medicated for ADHD, take your meds for both the test and lessons. I think the physical anxiety outweighs the benefits of improved focus. Talking of ADHD meds, I think amphetamines can give you the same level of focus without the anxiety (physical) caused by methylphenidate.

\- I've seen a lot of posts on here telling people not to take coffee before a test. I found it to improve my accuracy and reaction times when it comes to driving. Also, there was a study done on truck drivers taking coffee that showed it improved accuracy and reduced the risk of accidents on long drives. I'm not suggesting people take several cups of coffee, but even a few sips or half a cup can help, especially if you don't take coffee often. Something like green tea or a non-jittery energy drink may help, too. 

\- Don't use people who sell driving test cancellations unless they have a proven record with someone you trust. I got scammed twice. Chase was good for getting a full refund, but HSBC wasn't if you are going to try that route anyway. I would suggest the driving test cancellations app Testi if you can check the app several times a day, and Driving Test Cancellations Now if you want the test to be booked automatically.",1,1748440739.0,LearnerDriverUK,1,1.0,False

# The build-up

I arrived in Llanberis with my family the day before the Ultra-Trail Snowdonia 100k, instantly soaking in the buzzing atmosphere of nervous excitement that filled the race village. Registration had a surprisingly efficient vibe, feeling a little like airport security meets supermarket conveyor belt. Lots of moving parts, but impressively slick. Kit checks done, GPS tracker attached, race number in hand, drop bag dropped, I was officially ready to race.

Later that evening, I watched the Eryri Kids Mini 4k, which included my own children and some of their friends. Seeing the kids run with such joy and determination was genuinely inspiring, although it did make me wonder how I’d manage to keep my own spirits that high 60-70 kilometres into tomorrow’s mountain madness while heading up Yr Wyddfa.

My overnight accommodation was a shared bunkhouse with several other 100k runners. There was some brief nervous chatter about routes, gear choices, and weather predictions, but quickly everyone retreated to their bunks, hoping to steal a few hours' sleep before the big day. Unfortunately, sleep didn’t come easy for me. Managing only about three hours of broken rest and matching the equally unimpressive three hours from the previous night. I accepted that adrenaline and cold coffee would have to pick up the slack.

I woke around 2:30 am for a 4:30 am start, already in my race gear (yes, I’d gone to bed fully kitted out and I promise this was deliberate and not sheer laziness). At 3 am sharp, I forced down two cups of cold coffee, a questionable breakfast choice taste-wise, but effective at kick-starting my digestive system (thanks coffee!).

Wasting no time, I began my short, ten-minute stroll to the start line. Arriving in the darkened race village, I quickly visited the toilets (coffee, again proving its worth), then settled at a random table to mix up my Tailwind drinks and take on half a litre of water. By pure coincidence, I found myself sitting right next to Andy, the fellow runner I'd met and shared a brutal recce day with just weeks before. After a quick catch-up and last-minute discussion about the daunting route ahead, the ten-minute warning boomed (quietly) through the speakers.

We joined the crowd of runners converging at the start line, the atmosphere both electric and tense. I couldn't shake the feeling of nervousness, noticeably stronger than my previous 50-miler. Perhaps it was the sheer volume of runners around me, or simply because I knew exactly how brutally savage some sections of the next 100 kilometres were going to be.

# Llanberis to Pen y Pass via Bwlch Glas (11.9km)

The masses surged forward, pace steadily rising as we funnelled onto the road. The atmosphere felt charged, a mix of nervous chatter and quiet determination. Despite the crowd of runners, the first ascent towards Bwlch Glas was surprisingly manageable, though the sheer number of runners meant finding the optimal racing line was near-impossible, forcing many of us onto less ideal routes.

My original plan had been to start at about 5/10 on the effort scale, but excitement got the better of me, nudging it closer to a 6. I found myself moving past runners whose bib numbers hinted at top 50 rankings, prompting an immediate self-check: *“Hang on, Sebastian, this is too fast. Calm down, or you’ll regret this by lunchtime!”* Thankfully, common sense prevailed, and I eased off to a more sustainable rhythm, quickly settling into my own comfortable pace. Whenever I found myself chatting too long with others, I’d use the polite exit line, *“Anyway, I’m just going to settle into my own pace for a bit,”* allowing them to surge ahead. This wasn’t the moment to get carried away with someone else's race strategy.

Passing beneath the iconic railway bridge, the early-morning views were spectacular. A golden sunrise spilling out behind the peaks. Beautiful beyond belief, but there was little time for sightseeing today, so I powered onwards. Approaching the summit, a familiar voice called out - it was Andy again. He mentioned casually that he'd started right at the back and had impressively worked his way forward already.

The descent from Bwlch Glas down the PYG track was notoriously technical and a true graveyard for trail runners’ ambitions. I stuck close to Andy on this demanding descent, knowing this was exactly the sort of terrain that could abruptly end a race with one misplaced foot. Concentration was paramount here, but I felt my months of targeted downhill training paying off, navigating the rocks and steep drops with relative confidence.

In the back of my mind, though, I remained cautious, especially about a niggling knee concern from the taper period, which I’d optimistically labelled as mere “taper tantrums.” A few risky strides made my knee twinge slightly, causing momentary anxiety, but thankfully, these turned out to be isolated incidents that didn’t reoccur significantly after this section.

Emerging safely and thankfully uninjured at the Pen y Pass aid station, I was slightly surprised to see many runners skipping straight past. Considering the next station was a long way off, I decided a quick pit-stop was wise. A swift refill of around 700ml of water (500ml fully consumed, another 200ml to top up the partially used bottle) gave me peace of mind, knowing I had plenty of fuel and a water filter if needed. After all, there was plenty of brutal terrain still ahead, this wasn’t the time to skimp on preparation!

# Pen y Pass (11.9km) to Glan Dena (23.4km) via Glyder Fawr

Almost immediately after leaving Pen y Pass, the ascent towards the Glyders began. At first, the terrain felt familiar - reminiscent of my regular runs around Bannau Brycheiniog - but it wasn't long before things took a decidedly more “Eryri” turn. What started as a runnable trail rapidly devolved into a gruelling combination of steep climbs, endless rocky terrain, and mini scrambles. This was no longer a run, it was a survival exercise.

Andy quickly pulled ahead. He’s swift and seems to effortlessly glide over terrain that leaves mere mortals like me picking careful foot placements. Watching him go, I made peace with the fact that this would probably be the last I'd see of him during the race.

I fell into rhythm alongside other runners, exchanging brief conversations as we yo-yoed along the trails. One runner in particular, Stephanie, mentioned she’d started in wave 3 and was excited to see her family at upcoming support points. Impressed at how quickly she'd caught up, it was only days later I realised she was the remarkable athlete who hit the headlines for winning the women’s race while stopping to breastfeed mid-event. Needless to say, our pace alignment lasted all of five minutes before she surged off into the distance.

The views from Glyder Fawr were spectacular, clear skies revealing the mountains in all their rugged beauty. Yet the *“I just want to enjoy the views”* comments from fellow runners never fully resonate with me during races. Rightly or wrongly, my brain immediately flips into ‘race mode’: my world shrinks down to the immediate 100 metres ahead and 25 metres either side. For me, recces are for scenic appreciation; race days are for efficient progress and getting the job done.

About 20km into the race, reality struck hard enough to prompt a message to my fiancée simply saying, “So hard.” Feeling marginally sorry for myself, I slowed my pace briefly to read a few motivational messages from friends. These gave me a much-needed morale boost. At this stage, the race already felt like a full day’s effort crammed into just a few hours. I sent a couple more messages along the lines of “this is hard” (accompanied by the obligatory sick emoji), quickly followed by laughing emoji just to reassure everyone (and myself!) that I was still enjoying it. After all, this had all been my idea!

Descending through Devil’s Kitchen required immense concentration. The terrain here was relentlessly technical, loose rock, steep drops, dust, and slippery patches meant one false step could abruptly end my race. However, compared to my recce in howling 50-60mph winds, today’s conditions seemed almost friendly. My Brooks Cascadia 18 shoes, which had previously struggled somewhat on wet rock, really impressed me here; their traction was far better in dry conditions, boosting my confidence with every step.

Emerging from Devil’s Kitchen, the path alongside Llyn Idwal became moderately technical, easing off to gentler terrain near Llyn Bochlwyd. Though the next minor ascent brought back a hint of gnarliness, it was nothing compared to what I’d just navigated. By now the valley was warming noticeably, prompting me to top up my bottles at a couple of conveniently placed streams. Just the occasional half litre to stay topped-up and avoid dehydration.

From here, the runnable trail alongside Tryfan provided some much-needed relief. Still mostly on my own, I occasionally traded positions and nods of encouragement with runners who’d become familiar, including Alex and James, whose company would become increasingly welcome as the race progressed.

Finally arriving at Glan Dena aid station, I felt surprisingly good. There was relief at having survived Devil’s Kitchen, tempered by a clear awareness that plenty of challenges still lay ahead.

# Glan Dena (23.4km) to Llyn Eigiau (38.6km) via Carnedd Llewelyn

Leaving Glan Dena, I didn't linger; most runners were in the bustling supported area, enjoying the attention of friends and family. I was in the quieter, self-supported section, quickly grabbing some Näak, Coke, watermelon, oranges, and crisps before heading straight back out.

Five minutes down the trail, disaster struck! It turned out I'd inadvertently filled one of my bottles with the salted soup Näak mix. Yes, a cold salted soup flavoured drink. Absolutely vile. Not the start I'd envisioned for this particularly tough section. With no choice but to persevere, I reluctantly sipped this strange concoction, vowing bitterly “never again”.

This leg of the route was tough and unforgiving. Not only was Carnedd Llewelyn itself a significant climb, but the series of peaks either side added extra challenge. Recognising the distance to the next aid station, I made sure to refill water bottles whenever streams presented themselves.

The scramble up Pen Yr Ole Wen was particularly memorable. I caught up with Andy again here, who was clearly battling a low point. Many other runners were visibly shocked and struggling, but oddly enough, I was actually enjoying this scrambling section since it gave my tired calf muscles a welcome break. Plus, the stunning panoramic views certainly softened the blow of the steep climb, turning this into classic type-2 fun territory.

From Pen Yr Ole Wen, we contoured steadily upwards to Carnedd Dafydd. Feeling good, and encouraged by the incredible scenery, I even managed a quick video chat with my fiancée and kids. One of the benefits of a rare 4G spot. Their smiles provided a perfect morale boost just when I needed it.

The climb to Carnedd Dafydd was manageable (technical sections aside), followed by a pleasantly exposed and rocky ridge continuing towards Carnedd Llewelyn. It was fantastic running, and knowing the toughest terrain was now behind me, I was thoroughly enjoying myself. Passing Carnedd Llewelyn and heading towards Foel Grach felt almost routine, so much so, I nearly missed the subtle summit cairn completely.

Then came the exhilarating descent, a long, fast, unmarked fell-running section. Although runners were scattered far apart, we were all navigating down the mountain at speed. Here, I really let loose, overtaking several others as I flew down the grassy slopes and rocky terrain. In hindsight, speeding faster than my typical marathon pace downhill was perhaps overly ambitious. A fleeting thought - “I'm going to pay for this later” - turned out to be painfully prophetic much further along in the race.

During the descent, I passed a medic walking briskly towards a runner lying down but alert, later discovering via Facebook that the runner’s fall had ended their race prematurely. A stark reminder of how precarious these mountain trails could be.

Towards the bottom of the descent, I reconnected with Alex. He later told me he was struggling badly at this point, but I wouldn't have guessed; we briefly exchanged positions before settling into a rhythm together, catching up on each other's race so far.

As we approached the next aid station, it felt increasingly elusive. Despite the valley warming under what was probably a midday sun, I couldn't be bothered to check my watch since I was focused solely on reaching the aid station.

As I approached the aid station, I think James was heading out - though I can't quite recall the exact details through the mild brain fog - but we exchanged a quick high-five to celebrate reaching this far. When the small, minimal aid station finally appeared, I didn't hang around. A quick dip of my hat into cool water and a top-up of my bottles was enough. I was ready to move swiftly onwards.

# Llyn Eigiau (38.6km) to Capel Curig (50.9km)

Compared to the gnarly sections we'd already faced, this leg was relatively gentle, comprising of rolling terrain with just a few minor climbs. It was certainly the most runnable part of the course so far, although the numerous narrow paths lined with stubborn shrubs made it somewhat irritating, reopening cuts from earlier scrapes and generously adding a fresh set of scratches.

Down in the valley, the temperature started creeping upwards, creating an extra challenge. Fortunately, my heat-acclimatisation training was paying dividends, but Alex was slightly less enthusiastic about the rising mercury. To his credit, he tackled it without complaint, taking it like an absolute champ. He kept reminding me that it was much hotter when he did the 100k last year.

This stretch turned out to be the most uneventful in terms of drama, something of a relief. We settled into a comfortable rhythm, reflecting on how far we'd come, pleased with our progress so far, and discussing plans for the halfway aid station at Capel Curig. We both agreed we'd earned a short break there, ideally around 20–25 minutes, though certainly not exceeding 30.

At one point, I noticed Alex was using just a single pole, which seemed like an unusual choice. Curiosity got the better of me, so I questioned his strategy only for Alex to reveal he'd snapped the other pole earlier in the race. Mystery solved. Impressively, he continued to soldier on with a single pole until much later, when he finally managed to acquire a replacement.

As we descended towards the “never-ending reservoir” (which we avoided thanks to a last-minute route change), the terrain turned mildly boggy. Soon after, we were greeted by the shade of a welcome forest, offering temporary respite from the scorching valley heat. As the trails became easier, the buzz of spectators grew louder, which gave our spirits a real boost.

At this point, Alex and another runner fell into conversation, so I happily dropped back a little, enjoying some solitude and letting my mind wander as we cruised downhill. Shortly before Capel Curig, the other runner drifted away (I'm not entirely sure if she surged ahead or dropped back, I was too deep in thought!), and Alex and I regrouped to enter the aid station together.

Approaching Capel Curig, we saw a sign optimistically stating, ""Aid Station 500 meters."" In true ultra-running style, that supposed '500 metres' felt suspiciously closer to a kilometre... Thankfully, the cheering spectators lining the trail more than made up for the miscalculation. Their enthusiasm was incredibly uplifting and genuinely humbling.

About 100 metres out from the aid station, a young volunteer sprinted alongside us, diligently noting our bib numbers before shouting them across a hedge to another young volunteer, who promptly relayed them to the adults ahead. A superb bit of teamwork and brilliantly executed, I was truly impressed. By the time we arrived, our drop bags were waiting for us, as if by magic. Top marks to those kids!

The volunteers at Capel Curig, like those at previous stations, were absolutely fantastic. They jumped straight in to assist with refuelling, refilling bottles, and generally providing anything we needed. I quickly swapped my shoes to a pair half a size larger, changed socks, charged my phone and watch, and restocked fuel supplies. In hindsight, I realised I'd been using the aid stations better than expected, meaning I didn't need as much of my own fuel, so I reduced my carry load slightly.

After about 20–25 minutes we were ready to push on, though reflecting afterwards, I reckon I could have streamlined the process considerably. Something to improve on for future events. Less faff, more running!

# Capel Curig (50.9km) to Gwastadanas (62.5km) via Moel Siabod

From Capel Curig, the route wasted no time throwing us straight onto the ascent of Moel Siabod. While the climb itself ranged from easy to moderate and thankfully lacked any significant technical sections, its sheer length made it feel relentless. It was here that Alex first started mentioning cramps, prompting me to swiftly hand over some electrolytes. Until now, I'd been more than happy letting Alex take the lead - especially as he seemed to have a natural advantage on the descents - but Moel Siabod marked the moment when our leadership roles became more interchangeable. The hills were becoming my territory, and I felt surprisingly strong tackling this steady, persistent incline.

After enduring what felt like an eternity, and encountering the inevitable false summits, we finally reached the peak. The reward was an enjoyable, swift descent, allowing us to recuperate from the relentless uphill slog. We quickly caught up with James, the cheerful Australian runner I'd been playing cat-and-mouse with since the Glyders, and with whom I’d shared that morale-boosting high-five back at Glan Dena. It was great having another familiar face around for some consistent conversation. Moments like this reminded me of something I'd reflected on during my build-up: sharing adventures with others genuinely enhances the experience, and this race was reinforcing that truth with every kilometre.

Following the pleasant descent off Moel Siabod, we settled into a steady cruise along easier terrain, with Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon) looming ominously ahead. The heat in the valley was becoming increasingly noticeable, but we managed it as best we could.

This quieter stretch gave me some time to reflect on my fuelling strategy so far. The Tailwind mix I'd packed was proving largely redundant, given how frequently I was topping up with Näak at the aid stations. Even my trusty Maurten 160s seemed unnecessary, as I'd discovered a newfound preference for my homemade gels, they were easier to handle, had a more drinkable consistency, and offered the added bonus of extra sodium. In hindsight, had I relied more heavily on these gels, my fuelling might've been even better. Still, it wasn't too shabby.

When we eventually reached Gwastadanas aid station, it felt like stepping into a scene of mild carnage. Tired runners sat around looking shattered, some clearly teetering on the edge of a DNF. Everyone knew the brutal climb up Yr Wyddfa was lurking just around the corner. I didn't linger longer than necessary, although I did nip to the loo, determined not to get caught short halfway up Wales' highest peak. There are places you really don’t want nature calling, and halfway up Yr Wyddfa definitely ranks high on that list!

# Gwastadanas (62.5km) to Bron y Fedw Uchaf (80km) via Yr Wyddfa

Leaving Gwastadanas, I felt surprisingly good, having consumed enough Coca-Cola, watermelon, Näak (thankfully not the salted soup variety), oranges, and water to fuel an entire primary school sports day. Alex double-checked our water supplies and reckoned we had enough for this notoriously challenging and technical stretch, the longest gap between aid stations. Admittedly, from the very outset, my attitude towards this leg was more “let’s get it over and done with” than anything else. I’d enjoyed it enough on the recce; today I just wanted it ticked off the list, especially with the thought of my fiancée, kids, and friends waiting to cheer me on at Bron y Fedw Uchaf.

The first few kilometres were moderately technical, rolling along nicely and providing ample opportunities for chats and catch-ups with fellow runners, including James, who remained in our little running pack. We adopted a fighter-jet formation along the trails, politely thanking walkers who made way for us and exchanging quick, supportive conversations with the weary-looking 100-mile runners we passed. Major kudos to them. If we thought 100k was tough, their undertaking was simply heroic.

Unfortunately, this section is also where I managed a few spectacular tumbles, slicing my knee and shin in the process. A quick pause at a stream to wash out the cuts revealed blood that was more theatrical than serious, though the number of concerned hikers exclaiming, “You’re bleeding! That looks really bad!” became quite amusing. Each time I cheerily responded with, “’Tis but a mere scratch!”, enjoying my brief moment of Monty Python fame. Whether these tumbles were down to flat, rocky terrain being my kryptonite, general fatigue setting in, or simply wearing shoes half a size bigger than normal, I wasn't sure. But it probably had more to do with my notoriously low foot lift. Clearly, I need some knee-raising drills in my next training block!

As we approached Yr Wyddfa, the mood inevitably became more serious. We took advantage of a lovely stream pool to refill our bottles, dunk our caps, and chat briefly to some bemused hikers who clearly thought we were mad for voluntarily running 100k through the mountains - but still wished us good luck anyway. We even got an unexpected (and distant!) eyeful of some adventurous skinny-dippers enjoying an Instagram-worthy waterfall plunge. Always something new in Eryri…

By now, my poles were becoming increasingly stubborn, jamming infuriatingly in my quiver. Although everything had worked flawlessly for months, the second half of this race turned into a pole-wrestling match. Fortunately, Alex and James took turns kindly rescuing me each time this happened, saving me from having to stop and take off my pack because apparently, I’d rather run 100km than deal with minor backpack adjustments!

I set a strong, steady pace up Yr Wyddfa, passing many other runners along the way. My beast-hill training circuit seemed to be paying off handsomely. However, Alex began suffering from cramp and fatigue, prompting me to dish out more electrolytes and whatever motivational clichés I could muster, mostly variations on “You’ll be fine, the gels will kick in soon!”, though this was possibly delivered as some form of grunt. Secretly, I was mentally preparing to push ahead solo, but desperately wanted Alex to stay with me, after all, who else would sort out my jammed poles?

We soon faced a decision point - one path was slightly longer with technical steps; the other shorter but involved some exposed scrambling. Recalling this exact unnerving scramble from my recce, I confidently moved onto the ""less exposed"" option, chuckling afterwards at the shell-shocked expressions of runners emerging from the exposed route, muttering things like “well, that was unnecessarily terrifying!”

Miraculously, as we neared the summit of Yr Wyddfa, Alex bounced back spectacularly. The fuel and electrolytes had done the trick. Now, it looked like I’d have good company for the remainder of the race. Unfortunately, we'd lost James about 3/4 of the way up Yr Wyddfa, our pace was just slightly too much at that point but I later saw that he'd finished with a good time! The final approach involved occasional very light scrambling along exposed ridges, but after previously experiencing this route in 50mph winds, the mere 30mph breeze today felt pleasant. Heights aren’t my issue, but edges certainly are; still, today, I was feeling unusually confident and glided across the ridge with confidence.

At the summit, a crafty runner emerged from the still-open café with a half-empty Coke bottle, offering it around. While another runner gratefully took it and promptly handed it to Alex, I chuckled and politely declined. I wasn’t falling for that trap! The realisation slowly dawned on Alex: he was now the unwilling custodian of someone else’s unwanted Coke bottle, as the original owner swiftly disappeared down the trail.

We pushed on, picking up the pace down a supposedly “very runnable” section. I jokingly chastised Alex for his overly optimistic description. To be fair, it was actually runnable but my quads were beginning to pay the price for my earlier enthusiastic downhill sprinting! Still, from our vantage point, we could already spot the next aid station, Bron y Fedw Uchaf, far below. The thought of my family and friends waiting there gave me a huge boost. I was feeling strong and incredibly relieved that I wouldn’t have to tackle this descent in the dark.

The final approach was a joyous, if somewhat blurry, whirlwind of clapping spectators and waving friends. Spotting my family, I waved and I blew kisses towards my children, and managed a brief (albeit brain-fogged) chat with them before entering the aid station. My fiancée helped me restock on Coke, water, oranges, and watermelon. She also showed motherly concern for my bloodied leg, fetching a medic who administered a quick disinfectant spray. Alex helpfully reminded me that nightfall was approaching, prompting a swift rummage for head torches.

Exiting the aid station, I exchanged low-fives and smiles with everyone again. Alex and I typically walked for a few minutes after each aid station to let things settle, but once my kids raced alongside us on the other side of the barriers, I declared, “We’d better jog otherwise, this will turn into kid carnage!” And with that, we picked up the pace and disappeared triumphantly into the sunset.

# Bron y Fedw Uchaf (80km) to Betws Garmon (88.3km) via Mynydd Mawr

This section felt refreshingly short and sweet. Just 8km. By now, the cooler evening air was a welcome break after enduring a roasting Welsh summer's day for the previous 40km or so.

Barely minutes into this leg, I confidently took a swig from the bottle my fiancée had kindly refilled at the aid station, expecting my familiar flat coke. Instead, I was greeted with full-fizz Coca-Cola, sending bubbles shooting painfully up my nose, causing confusion.  I chuckled at the unexpected sabotage, though I’m sure it was accidental (at least, I hope so!).

As we approached Beddgelert Forest, the transition from twilight to pitch black was alarmingly swift. Initially, we optimistically tried to navigate without headtorches, but after nearly tripping twice within a hundred metres, I wisely conceded defeat, switching mine on and guiding us through like a slightly less heroic Indiana Jones. Everyone else quickly followed suit.

Beddgelert Forest turned out to be one of those irritatingly tricky sections. Not fast, not slow, but just enough streams, boggy ditches, and ankle-snaring roots to keep us fully occupied. There were also plenty of low-hanging branches to duck beneath (or accidentally snap back into each other's faces). By the time we emerged, ""sorry!"" had firmly become the most frequently uttered word between us.

Despite our navigational best efforts, we briefly veered off-track in the forest, confidently following what we thought was the ""obvious"" path, before realising we'd inadvertently signed up for a bit of bonus bushwhacking. Thankfully, our detour was only a couple of hundred metres, more amusing than damaging.

Once clear of the trees, we began the ascent up Mynydd Mawr, which felt like a classic short, sharp shock to our fatigued legs. Steep in parts, but mercifully brief, we tackled it one step at a time. At this point, Andy rejoined us briefly and admitted he'd experienced serious doubts earlier, convinced he was destined for a DNF - something Alex said had also considered. Hearing these moments of vulnerability was a reassuring reminder of just how mentally tough everyone out here really was.

Feeling surprisingly strong, I took charge of the uphill pace, passing other runners with renewed determination. This grassy climb felt oddly comforting, reminding me vividly of my training runs in the Brecon Beacons. However, what goes up must come down, and the descent, although short, was brutally steep. As predicted, my quads finally issued a stern reminder of my overly ambitious sprint down from Foel Grach some 50 kilometres earlier. While I was pulling Alex uphill, he was unquestionably dragging me down the mountains. We made quite the complementary team in terms of pacing!

On reflection, this stretch firmly confirmed my preference for my homemade gels; they’d kept me well fuelled, and they’ll definitely play a more prominent role in future races. Of course, I'll still carry some alternatives - just in case - but the ratio will be heavily in favour of my own concoctions.

After what felt like a comically winding route through darkening paths, then an interminably long and confusing trek through a campsite - where finding the exit felt like an escape-room challenge - we finally stumbled upon the welcome sight of the final aid station. A brief five-minute stop was all we needed; at this stage, I couldn’t face another sip of coke, fizzy or flat. Water and orange slices would suffice.

Somewhat optimistically, I asked a volunteer how much longer she thought we had until the finish line. She cautiously ventured ""about three hours"", though how she was supposed to accurately guess that, I have no idea. Personally, I felt confident we could manage it in two hours or less. Alex, meanwhile, thought it would take longer, but I stubbornly insisted that a sub-20-hour finish was still very much achievable. Only one way to find out!

# Betws Garmon (88.3km) to Llanberis (103.9km) via Moel Eilio

Leaving Betws Garmon, we quickly lost sight of Andy; neither Alex nor I fancied hanging around at this point. Joining forces instead with another runner from Newcastle (John, I believe, apologies if I’ve got that wrong!), we set off into the darkness for the final push.

I took point, my headtorch doing its best lighthouse impression, illuminating grassy stretches, sneaky streams, and several frustratingly tricky corners. Thankfully, the reflective route markers glistened reassuringly in the distance, making our late-night navigation somewhat less perilous. After some fiddly, flashlight-guided manoeuvres, we found ourselves facing the final ascent: Moel Eilio.

The climb wasn’t particularly steep, but it was long, an endless slog that felt oddly isolated. With the wind gusting and the darkness deepening, there was a distinct air of “why exactly did I sign up for this again?” Yet somehow, trudging uphill felt comfortingly familiar, akin to my training on the grassy expanses of the Brecon Beacons. Still, fatigue was certainly setting in. I repeatedly pointed at looming peaks in the gloom, asking Alex hopefully if these were our final mini-summits. Each time, he patiently replied, “No, that’s still Snowdon,” causing me to laugh and groan at my stubborn optimism.

Looking across at the slopes of Yr Wyddfa, a mesmerising chain of headtorches zigzagged slowly downwards. I silently saluted those hardy souls, many would be out there for another six hours or more, battling their own personal races in the pitch-black night. Huge respect, but I was very relieved not to be among them!

The downhill sections soon became my nemesis, my quads protesting every step. The pain was tolerable but persistent, about a 6 out of 10 on the “why did I push so hard earlier?” scale. Alex led the descents expertly, forcing me to push hard to keep pace. At one point, attempting to multitask by texting my fiancée to confirm my finish time cost me precious seconds, and two runners whizzed past me mid-message. The competition was fierce and close, even this late on!

Eventually, we hit the Llanberis path. A quick time-check confirmed sub-20 hours was still very much achievable. Alex hesitated, understandably torn - should we coast home, or really go for it? “I don’t know what to do” he said, “Let’s go for it!” I declared, immediately ramping up to near-marathon pace despite already clocking over 100km.

Just as I was feeling heroic, disaster struck. A vicious stitch jabbed me sharply in the side. Alex urged me on, shouting “Run through it, you can do it!” I valiantly tried, but after an agonising attempt at keeping pace while frantically pinching my side, I finally shouted, “I can’t keep going at this pace, go get the sub-20!” Alex hesitated, but I firmly waved him onwards, slowing to a manageable jog to ease the stitch.

Seconds later, Alex disappeared into the distance but amazingly, after two minutes of more cautious jogging, the stitch vanished. I thought, “Hang on - I might still have this!” With renewed determination (and probably a slightly deranged grin), I surged back up to marathon pace, overtaking several surprised runners while shouting encouragement, “We’ve made it! Well done!”

The final road stretch into Llanberis seemed to drag on forever. After spending hours in isolation, the sudden reappearance of cars felt bizarrely alien. Marshals cheerfully directed me around a seemingly endless route around the back streets, but I refused to let my pace drop.

At last, the finish line came into view. Hearing the cheers and applause, I summoned every scrap of remaining strength for a triumphant sprint finish. My family and friends appeared, cheering wildly from the right, boosting me even further. I pushed hard, crossing the line with a tidal wave of relief and emotion. I couldn’t believe I’d done it, and in under 20 hours no less!

Alex was waiting at the finish, and we congratulated each other heartily, later briefly catching up with Andy, too. Glancing at my watch, it showed 105km. No wonder my legs felt ready to detach themselves!

For the next 15-20 minutes, I sat slightly dazed, feeling distinctly queasy. My fiancée and friends later described me as acting “like I was slightly drunk,” which, to be fair, was probably accurate.

1kxhqen,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/1kxhqen/anxiety_and_medication/,Anxiety and Medication,"Hi folks, 

I've had t1d since I was 9 years old.

I need your advice. I have been prescribed with sertraline (Lustral) by a psychiatrist for anxiety. You know how us diabetics fear about medication. I started it's my third day. I also cleared it with my endocronologist. But all I can think of is whether I needed the medication, would it rack my brain and bg levels. Did I only experience a caffeine induced attacks and were the rest caffeine withdrawal.

I always feared for my blood glucose levels. With the introduction of CGMs that alliviated a bit.

For example I always had a slight fear if my sensor (libre and then sibionics) wasn't measuring right and had panic when I didn't have my glucometer with me.

On 8 may, I had a lot of caffeine, that night I become almost mad with anxiety. I had a sensor change coming, I did the sensor change and saw that I had no spare sensors. I immediately ordered. I worried what it would be if the sensors didn't arrive on time. 

I also suspected my glucometer (which was cheap and purchased recently from a similar scare in a movie theather).  I worried that my glucometer was left at work. Later that day I found a spare sensor and two additional glucometers. The fear didn't leave me, I checked constantly. I feared my glucometers didn't work either. I feared chinese sibionics sensor wouldn't measure right. The day after I purchased two sensors more, found another glucometer. I was testing with two or three devices simultaneously. 

I had a similar panic episode earlier in the day, because I swirched to a low carb breakfast and I thought my BG was going to crash. 
Prior to that I had fears that my insulin wasn't working (I have a defective fridge that overcools).
I had fears what would I do if I accidentaly got arrested or got stranded in an earthquake. (We recently had many political arrests in my country and an earthquake).

Upon this attack, I quit coffee cold turkey, (was averaging about 6-7 cups a day, sometimes more). I went to a cardiologist the very next day of the attack. He put me a halter for heart and blood pressure and after inspecting results said I was completely fine, just needed regular sleep, water and exercise.

I did that it worked for a week, anxiety came back at the weekend. I was searching for a psychologist and psychiatrist first thing in the morning. I couldn't bare it.

On Wednesday I couldn't stay at work and went to a psychiatrist. He said this was completely normal, listened to me prescribed me sertraline and sent me away with another appointment in three weeks. He was a cool guy.

I didn't take the medicine for the first 4 days and started on the fifth. I've been taking the medicine for 5 days. All I can think of is that was this a result of caffeine withdrawal. Do I need the medication? What if I cannot go off of the medicine? What if I cannot function? It is the same feeling as not having a glucometer/CGM with me. 

I will talk to my psychiatrist as well about this.

Did you experience something similar. Do any of you use antidepressants for anxiety? Does it have a diabetic component like mine? How does it affect your blood sugar?

I just wanted to hear your experience or thoughts about this.

I work at a small shop. We have 2 shops in different cities. 
Currently in the other city there's a girl working there, and since my boss couldn't go and come as much as he'd like his uncle (who lives in another country) came to help for a while until we get like more established on the market, and also to help my coworker a little bit because she was there alone.

A few days ago coworker told me that her boss (my boss’s uncle) started harassing her by telling her things like he hadn’t noticed how beautiful she is, or what did you do to yourself that you’re too beautiful, and started calling her love. In our culture it is common to call strangers love, or to be very affectionate, but my coworker says it just doesn’t feel right when he calls her that, plus from my side I find it very unprofessional. 

Last weekend his wife left the country to go visit their daughter and he invited my coworker to go out on Saturday to eat because his wife isn’t here and he’s alone and has nothing to do. My coworker told him no, and that she uses her free day to spend with her family.

Recently they’ve been looking for someone to be there (as my boss’s uncle will leave soon, like in a month or 2) with her working, they initially thought of a guy so he can help her carry heavy things, but my coworker said she’d rather a woman because will be more helpful than a guy, the woman will help her also deal with customers, and that between them both they can carry the boxes and do the hard work.

My coworker gave the man the phone number of a friend of hers to be interviewed for the job. My boss’s uncle asked her also for a photo of her, she sent it to him, and then he started saying inappropriate things like “I also want someone to make me company because I’m alone and I don’t want anything bad, just someone who makes me feel like family.” My coworker said “please I don’t want any kind of trouble because she has her husband and the man said “we’ll, I also have a wife”
Then he even asked her how much she weighs.

This conversation was in the shop’s phone. 

Then in my coworker’s personal phone she sent him the contact of her friend, and he asked her if she knew how her friend got a boyfriend. My coworker said don’t know, don’t care.

The man texted her friend like at 6pm and told her I'll call you back later because I'm at a work dinner. Around 11:30pm he texted her and asked her where she works for and what experience she has. She told him that she isn't working at the moment, and that in her country she had experience in managing shops and storage, also experience in customer service.
He tells her that it is no necessary experience, that he's looking for someone who works at the shop and also make him some company because he's alone here (his wife left like no more than 3 days ago), like going out to take dinner and stuff, and how much she'd charge him. She said for the shop's work you're the owner, you know how much you're willing to pay, and he said ""how much would you charge me for going out after work? Dinner and coffee are on me."" She said not interested thanks.

My coworker told me about it, sent me the screenshots, and told me she's very uncomfortable with the situation, and is a bit scared they might fire her if she speaks about it, and asked me if I could talk to my boss about it. (To make it clear my boss is the boss boss, his uncle is like temporary boss, because my boss was the one who hired her and pays her salary).
I told my mom about it and she told me I should talk to my boss about this, because it is very uncomfortable what he's doing, plus he's also using the excuse of getting a new worker for the shop to get a hooker while his wife is out of town. 

I talked to my boyfriend about it, he said I shouldn't talk to my boss about it, that it is something very personal so it should be my coworker the one who talks.

My coworker told me as I have a closer relationship with my boss if I could talk to him. I think it isn't bad that I talk to my boss about it even if it didn't happen to me. I also think that the way he treats this is the same way he would treat the situation if it happened to me.

I'm writing because I'm in a situation that's making me a bit uneasy, and I'd appreciate some advice on how to proceed.

I'm 19, quite shy, and I go to a gym where I met a girl my age who I really like. At first, we just exchanged greetings and smiles, but recently, after I took the initiative to talk to her, we've started having more conversations. She's always kind, often smiles, shares some personal details, and seems to enjoy my company. With others at the gym, she seems more reserved.

Recently, though, I heard a rumor that she might only be interested in women. I haven't heard this directly from her—it's just something that's been passed around by others. This has left me confused about how to act: on one hand, I'd like to keep getting to know her and maybe ask her out for coffee after a workout; on the other, I'm worried about misreading the situation or making her uncomfortable.

I'm not sure whether to give any weight to these rumors or to trust the positive interactions we've had.  
So I'd like to ask:

* What is the most respectful and direct way to find out if someone might be interested in going out with me, without being intrusive or putting pressure on them?
* How can I manage the insecurity that comes from third-party rumors without letting them influence me too much?

Thank you to anyone willing to offer advice or share their perspective!

I really tried to pump up the rep for AC. in Smash, & you’ll see that with how many assists I’ve added. The series just had such a wide cast of beloved characters that deserve to be included somehow! 

Potential Fourth Playable Character: KK Slider. He is definitely the most recognizable & unique characters out of those I haven’t included or Tom Nook. Animal Crossing is one of Nintendo’s massive franchises & deserves heavy representstion. But I think the main three I have cover it decently well for now. KK’s moveset would likely be him attacking with his guitar & sound wave attacks. We’ll see down the line what I decide.

Stages:
- Smashville
- Town and City is now just the City Square, keeping it distinct from Smashville.
- Tortimer Island
- Nook’s Cranny: takes place in the interior of the store, the Nooklings’ home stage, and would feature tables, furniture, & items that would spawn in during items-on matchups 

Assist Trophies: Kapp’n & Resetti return
- DJ K.K. Hosts a concert which makes the stage dark and has a laser light show which distract and hurt the opponents! Would be his final smash if he’s playable.
- Flick: a favorite new character of mine. He runs around the stage trying to catch a flying Stag Beetle. The beetle has a pointy hitbox on it’s horn, and Flick can catch the opponents by accident. If he does he will swing his net and throw them away.
- Celeste: Summons a meteor shower of shooting stars that hurt opponents (& sometimes Power Stars or Star Rods)
- Redd: summons Super Mushrooms & Poison Mushrooms (in reference that he sells real and fake art)
- Brewster: Brews a cup of coffee for the summoner, greatly increasing their speed.

Skins:

Villager: various designs based on the avatars from all different games. The main Male & Female skin will be based on the ones from New Leaf, since they are currently the ones used commonly in merch (plus Mario Kart lol). Also I would alter skin colors here to have some more variety. 

Isabelle: based on her various & seasonal outfits from New Leaf, Pocket Camp, & New Horizons, plus a color swap based on Dibgy!

Nooklings: Base: City Folk / main merch design
Outfit swaps based on their following outfits:
- Pajamas
- Original AC / Wild World
- New Horizons hawaiian shirts
- New Horizons winter green sweaters
- New Horizons upgraded Nook’s Cranny apron & hat outfit
- Red jacket outfit
- Striped outfit

And there we have it. Let me know what you all think! I’m sure there’s even more I could have added. But I had a lot of fun with these parts. How do we feel about KK?

The world of music saw a flurry of activity on May 28, 2025, with stories ranging from viral internet sensations and celebrity coffee critiques to serious legal allegations and threats of violence. The day’s headlines paint a picture of the diverse and often unpredictable nature of the music industry.

One of the most heartwarming stories of the day involves Brazilian nun Sister Marizele Cassiano, whose beatboxing performance has captivated audiences worldwide. The nun went viral after showcasing her impressive musical talent on a Catholic TV channel on May 20th. The video, now circulating widely, features Sister Marizele seamlessly transitioning from melodic singing to rhythmic beatboxing, using only her mouth and tongue. Her performance quickly sparked a spontaneous dance session, with a fellow nun and a priest joining in the joyful display. This unexpected display of musical talent and joy highlights the power of music to transcend boundaries and bring people together.

On a lighter note, Punjabi singer-actor Diljit Dosanjh provided a comedic take on luxury experiences, specifically expensive coffee. Dosanjh shared a video in which he sampled the ""most expensive"" coffee in London, priced at a staggering £265 (approximately Rs 30,580). The coffee, sourced from a family-run estate in Okinawa, Japan, and touted for embodying the Japanese pursuit of perfection, failed to impress the singer, who humorously remarked in Punjabi, “For this much money, I could attend a wedding in India.” The video, shared on his Instagram, highlights the celebrity's humorous take on life and resonated with fans.

However, the day also brought some deeply troubling news. Rapper Emiway Bantai reportedly received a death threat and a ransom demand following the release of a tribute song to Sidhu Moosewala. The threatening message, which also included a demand for Rs 1 crore, was sent on May 25th to a mobile number registered with Bantai's music label, Bantai Records. According to police sources, the message was allegedly from Goldy Brar, a Canada-based gangster and associate of Lawrence Bishnoi. Rohit Godara, another figure associated with the gang, was also mentioned in the threat. Emiway Bantai, a resident of Navi Mumbai, has filed a complaint with the police. This incident underscores the persistent threat of violence in certain segments of the music industry and the dangers faced by artists who may be perceived as having crossed lines.

Adding to the day's somber news, American music producer and rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs is facing severe allegations stemming from testimony given in court by a former employee. Capricorn Clark, who worked for Combs for over 14 years, testified that Combs threatened to kill rapper Kid Cudi in December 2011. According to Clark's testimony, Combs was enraged after discovering that Cudi was dating singer Cassie Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend. Clark recounted an incident where Combs arrived at her home early in the morning carrying a gun and told her, “Get dressed, we’re going to go kill him.” The testimony further alleges that they went to Cudi’s house, where Combs confronted him. The allegations against Combs, if proven true, paint a disturbing picture of violence and intimidation within the music industry.

In summary, the May 28, 2025 music news landscape presented a range of contrasting stories. While the infectious joy of a beatboxing nun brought smiles, the serious threats and allegations surrounding Emiway Bantai and Sean “Diddy” Combs respectively, raised serious concerns about safety and ethical conduct within the industry. This stark contrast highlights the complex and often contradictory nature of the music world. The playful critique of high-end coffee by Diljit Dosanjh provided a touch of levity, illustrating the diversity and range of content that makes up the daily cycle of music news. As these stories develop, they will undoubtedly continue to impact artists, fans, and the industry as a whole.

Been on the bride's side twice and groom's side thrice, 1 couple I've known since college days.

At work, I have a little red Bodum press which is about three cups. I put in two or so tablespoons of a coarser grind into this one. I stir it and let it steep for several minutes before I pour my cup, and it tastes about the same despite being a completely different brand.

  
Both of these are medium or dark roasts.

For either of these, pouring in more grounds or letting it steep longer only seems to make it bitter. I can't find a meaningful difference between the types of beans I use. Should I use less grounds? Is there that big a difference from storebought and local grown coffee?

He travels a lot for work like big conferences out of town that last a couple of weeks, sometimes even longer. And I’ve noticed this weird little pattern that’s been bothering me.

Every time he’s about to head out on one of these trips, he suddenly starts grooming... down there. Like full blown clean shave. Smooth as a dolphin. He doesn't do that normally only right before he leaves. It’s become so obvious that now I low-key start getting anxious whenever a trip’s coming up.

I’m not the super jealous type and I’m definitely not trying to be a clingy weirdo, but c’mon... you don’t suddenly start caring about being baby-smooth unless you’ve got someone to show it to, right?

This week he had a work trip to Miami, and I tagged along for the first weekend just for fun. While I was out grabbing coffee, he took a shower and yup came out freshly shaved. I kinda teased him about it and he laughed it off saying it was ""just in case he went swimming."" 🧐

But let’s be real. You’re not swimming in your boxers at a conference. And I’ve literally never heard him mention the hotel pool in all his other trips.

Anyway, now I can’t stop thinking about whether I’m just overthinking or if my gut is trying to warn me. He’s been extra cuddly and sweet, which usually happens when he knows I’m upset or if he’s trying to keep things calm.",18,1748439344.0,AmITheJerk,1,0.95,False

I had such a massive headache yesterday that I ended up ordering a cold brew at like 6pm



so what brings me here? I wanna find someone to chat with. hopefully a man that is consistent, shares the same ethical and moral values as myself and is willing to settle down should we hit it off down the road.



I tend to be very talkative although it does take me a little bit to warm up but if the vibe is right it doesn't take me too long.

with that said a little bit about me. I am a 32 year old latina trans woman who loves getting to know new people. I don't mean superficially like I REALLY want to get to know you, and that takes time so I don't expect you to tell me your whole life story in a day (if you do though I won't complain)

below a few of my interests/likes in no particular order:

\- lego (just building blocks and not models)

\- coffee (tell me how you like yours)

\- power rangers (I have started the series so many times and just fail at ever finishing a season)

\- documentaries (used to really like science ones, now I am very much into historical ones)

\- history (American history is interesting but I wanna learn more about the world. if you like this subject teach me, I'd love to listen to you ramble about your favorite time period)

\- gaming (PC/Switch... I am super casual, I am not a gamer at all. also idk what rpg, mmrpg, fps, or other terms mean... but I see them all the time haha)

\- football (the real kind, not the american one, sorry. although nfl can be fun)

\- accents (southern american accents or british/irish are so freaking cute/hot)

\- puzzles (word, jigsaw, or sodoku)

\- anakin skywalker (not a big star wars follower but he is pretty damn cute... I like the trilogy where he appears and would like to explore more of that world)

\- pop music (maybe like late 90s to early 2010s) some rock, punk, and disco are great as well

\- reading (recently started reading books again, as opposed to just articles online and it's been really fun. tell me what the last book you read was)

\- tennis (there is the french open going on right now and I haven't tuned in yet, I am such a fake fan :/)

\- sparkling water (topo chico for life)

\- candles (went to bath and body works yesterday and had the time of my life smelling all of the candles that they had there. I was good and didn't buy a single thing as I have some candles at home but ugh come the fall time I am gonna go splurge)

\- cats (they are so fucking cute)

ok, I believe that is good enough to get the ball rolling. now I do not expect a relationship BUT please only reach out if you are willing to engage in something like that down the line. I'd hate to hit it off with someone and then have them be like ""oh I'm not really a relationship kinda guy""

if you are neurodivergent and/or nerdy PLEASE message me I wanna hear from you! I struggle with a few things myself and would like to have someone who is understanding chat with me.

furthermore be warned I DO struggle with attachment issues and can be clingy due to that fact but with proper communication and some consistency I am A-OK

*Why do Indian brides look their worst on their wedding day ?*

Now now, hear me out....

I've been to 6 wedding from 2024 till now. The most recent one being a week back.

Been on the bride's side twice and groom's side thrice, 1 couple I've known since college days.

I've always know that the wedding lehnga/sari costs a bomb (between 30k-50k) and the guy's sherwani around 15k-25k.

But I've also found out something else. That the girl's wedding make-up/christmas tree decoration/embalming cost 40k-60k INR????

And all this for the girl to look absolutely ewww on the stage. You can't even makeout a smile from a frown with that cake on the face. No honey, you made it worse with that paste on your face! You looked better when you hung out for coffee dates!

Whereas, 9/10 times the guy has had a shave/detanning, maybe even a facial if he's into it, 2 days prior and boom. Dassit.

Mind you, out of these 6, 3 girls would fall into the above avg category. They've looked fr better in their travel pics, bday pics, someone else's wedding pics but the makeup fudged it up, for all of them.
Irrespective of dark/fair. Irrespective of north-south.

The most common excuse being, that it makes for amazing pictures. Nope, it doesn't. The pictures were equally disappointing.

One of the brides even had an acne breakout due to the shiite make-up(at 8am in the morning)
That day, I saw real firefighting. Yikes!

Now another interesting thing I've observed, is it's the bride's best friends/cousins, usually a group of 2-3 that are roaming around n chilling that look the absolute best in the arena.
Subtle makeup, just the 🤌kinda saris/lehngas and ever smiling!!!!!

Just wanted to know, is it just me or do others feel the same ?
Do shadi make-up aunties have a nexus and have decided to ruin it for the bride ?

I’m a researcher studying small business operations in the specialty coffee industry, and I’m hoping to gather insights about the tools and systems nano, micro, and small roasters actually use in their day-to-day operations.

I’ve been struck by how resourceful and innovative small roasters are in solving operational challenges, often finding creative solutions that larger operations might overlook. Rather than making assumptions, I want to learn directly from you on what’s really working (and what isn’t).

What I’m hoping to learn about:

Financial Management & Projections
- What software/tools do you use for financial modeling and cash flow projections?
- How do you track profitability by batch, blend, or customer?

Green coffee sourcing & market monitoring

- Where do you source green coffee and how do you track pricing trends?
- Any tools for managing inventory, cupping notes, or supplier relationships?

Roasting ops
- What roasting software/logging systems are you using?
- How do you manage production planning and batch tracking?

General business ops
- Accounting software preferences for small roasting operations?
- Any unexpected tools that have become essential to your workflow?

- Your roasting scale (bags per week/month)
- Specific tools/software you rely on
- Biggest operational pain points you’re still working to solve

1kxh44z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1kxh44z/parents_setting_you_up_for_failure_in_careers/,Parents Setting You Up for Failure in Careers. Anyone relate?,"Yesterday, I told my parents I decided to cancel the LSAT and focus full-time on job searching. A few months ago, they basically forced me to register ""just to see where I am at,"" but I knew they would use that one score (which might not reflect my ability and stays on record) to pressure me into applying to low-ranked law schools despite my 3.95 GPA.

That experience made me realize how much control they still try to have over my life. Since then, I have been working with a college career advisor, who is honestly the only person giving me real support right now. I have been unemployed for almost six months, and I believe my parents' toxic influence is a huge reason why. Let me explain.

I have always been introverted and developed social anxiety growing up, partly from the bullying I went through in my hometown. I did not feel safe telling my parents, as they would blame me for being the target. They constantly dismissed my struggles, comparing everything to their experiences in war-torn Vietnam and saying I have it ""easy"" in the US.

I went to a cutthroat high school that crushed my mental health. I had thoughts of self-harm and had to fake being ""fine"" around my parents to avoid punishment. I did not have the grades they wanted, so they pushed me to attend a regionally known Christian college in-state that gave me a scholarship (not to be named due to privacy, and I will say it is not Liberty University terrible but a reputed nationally ranked college), even though I wanted to apply to more out-of-state schools. My mom literally cut off my college apps after I sent in a few to schools she did not ""see me at,"" stating how one of her co-worker's son only applied to two prestigious colleges and got into one (ironically he was also the other guy who ended up a similar situation with job search and he was unemployed longer than me). 

The lack of support and constant invalidation made it hard to develop the confidence and social skills needed for networking, which is something crucial in today’s job market. They told me that academic success alone leads to career success, which I now know is false.

College was not great either. It was a conservative, mostly white (and wealthy) Christian school in the middle of nowhere, which is not my vibe. I tried to make the most of it and chose Finance as a backup plan to law school. But my parents told me not to""get distracted"" with clubs or social events, and definitely not to switch paths. That meant I missed out on joining professional organizations that could have helped me build a network. As a non-religious person, I found opportunities to be limited as many of my college peers were involved in church, with a disproportional amount of organizations catered towards Christian peeps. Luckily, I did have other involvement that does not make my resume absolutely the worst. My parents view college with a utilitarian value by assuming that college is only about a degree that ""guarantees"" a job, and that other factors like the environment/experiences do not matter. 

When I started learning about networking, my parents told me it was for “white or Black people” and that it made me look ""needy and pathetic."" That mindset killed my motivation and kept me isolated. For example, I hesitated to reach out to alumni on LinkedIn, thinking that they would laugh at my struggles. Another example is when my dad told me not to reach out to my ex's dad (who is in an upper management position at a large company), stating that I must be on my own merit and how it is ""embarrassing"" to be hired only because I know someone. My parents also set me up with the thinking that people are there to ""stab my back,"" which I once agreed based on my past experiences with toxic people; however, I felt my parents were also the ones doing this too. 

There was one person I got close to, a white girl who was both incredibly supportive and kind of toxic. She was probably the most meaningful relationship I had during college, but also discouraged me from transferring schools (something I heavily considered given my GPA and need for better opportunities) and getting involved (with her clingy tendency). Her family actually liked me and were well-connected, but I doubted myself too much to take advantage of those networks. My parents, of course, told me her family only liked me because they assumed I would be successful, and that they would disown me if I did not live up to that. Despite my ex coming from wealth, she is not the type of person who marries for wealth; my parents however think that she is only dating me because she assumes I will be a future lawyer (not about hobbies, travel, coffee, music, and other factors including some trauma bonding from past bullies).

That relationship also helped me start coming to terms with my sexuality. I think I might be into guys and would love to have a boyfriend (and maybe future husband) someday if I ever get my life in order. Obviously, my parents would disown me if they found out, but at this point, I honestly just want to live my truth and stop living under their outdated ""traditional"" rules. It is weird to say, but I prefer dating outside of my race, as I felt my parents would put a Vietnamese girl to a much higher standard than people outside my ethnicity (as seen by how my parents are lenient around my white ex-girlfriend but ""wished"" for a Vietnamese girl, compared to how relatives treated my female cousin's new Vietnamese husband with too much tradition). It sucks to say that Asian parents contributed to our desire for dating outside race, and my desire to date a man outside of my race was my way of rebelling against rigid traditional norms that kept us awkward. 

Anyway, fast forward to now, I am six months out of college, still unemployed. I was made to focus only on the LSAT for months and told to ignore everything else. When I studied, I suspected I might be neurodivergent. I had focus issues, had to stim to concentrate, and saw huge gaps (15–20 points) between timed and untimed test scores. I told my parents, and they exploded by denying everything and even told me to lie to doctors about my mental health (not just neurodivergent, but like anxiety/depression).

Despite all that, I graduated Summa Cum Laude. My mom, who warned me a hundred times not to go below a 3.0, didn’tbelieve me until she saw my transcript. Still, they told me a high GPA is “easy” to get.

When I canceled the LSAT, they went ballistic. They have since been fear-mongering nonstop. They say things like:

* “Everyone else’s kids got jobs right after college.”
* “Jobs take a week to get. Just walk in wearing a suit.”
* “Canceling the LSAT means you’ll end up at Walmart.”
* “I know someone with a business degree working in a nail salon, and that will be you.”
* “Only a law degree will make you successful.”
* “That career advisor is fake positive, don’t trust him.”

And the kicker: they now say I should have joined a fraternity, even though they forbade it freshman year.

They also overshare humiliating stuff about me to their friends and coworkers. They compare me to people who started businesses in college (even though they discouraged me from pursuing or experimenting with my ideas). They rejected the idea of a gap year, saying professors would “forget me” and write me bad recs (???). Told me I would be laughed out of networking events. Told me not to “be unique.”

And when I told my mom I do not want kids, and would I rather travel, she told me I am ungrateful. This was after my parents “argue because of children” (aka me), but also says I should be thankful I was born. Also told me travel is way too expensive and unrealistic, and that I should stop dreaming big and ""stick with reality"".

The whole point of this post is: does anyone relate?

I feel like my parents give the worst advice possible. They see any setback as proof of total failure. Their arguments are full of fallacies:

* Sunk cost (you studied for the LSAT, so you have to take it)
* Strawman (me saying job searches take time = I am lazy)
* Hasty generalization (look at all the “other kids” using mostly Asian kids they know)
* Slippery slope (cancel LSAT = no job = no future = total failure)

They do not understand the job market, and their constant negativity is just making things worse. They actively discouraged networking, saying it “undermines merit,” and now I am here behind, trying to find my way.

Yes, I am a slow starter. But I believe late bloomers can win too. The few successful people I have met, such as professors and my ex’s family, actually see potential in me despite my adversity. I just wish my parents did too.

I want to move out, get my career going, and finally feel like me. Right now, I just feel like this awkward Asian guy stuck in a house that does not allow him to grow. I wanted to prove my parents completely wrong about my future and be this successful guy who shatters underestimation again. Once I get out of this house, I hope to become this handsome man who successfully relearns social skills to hopefully break barriers and make history one day.

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning from the inside out. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

Here’s what happened…

>> Ready To See If Mitolyn Actually Delivers? Start Your Own 90-Day Test—Risk-Free.

Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for years, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on Mitolyn, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached energy and weight loss as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body produce energy more efficiently. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s official website, I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, no expectations, no pressure—just 90 days of real testing.

Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?

I was about to find out. 

My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, I noticed less bloating after dinner, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the 3PM crash that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

Takeaway for Month 1: Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. Nothing flashy—but real.

Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. My cravings were practically gone, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper. And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

Takeaway for Month 2: Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, my energy was stable from morning to night. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

Takeaway for Month 3: Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.

The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well

Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: cellular energy is everything. The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.

Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up

The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks. That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.

Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the regeneration of mitochondrial DNA, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.

What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around. These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times. I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.

>> Don’t Just Take My Word For It—Experience The Difference** With Mitolyn For Yourself.**

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly. Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.

My ideal weekend? Starts with a workout or a hike, followed by a croissant and coffee, maybe a beach trip, and ends with a BBQ. I’m a morning person through and through, and nothing starts my day better than a freshly brewed coffee. I don’t have pets (yet), but I dream of owning two Cane Corsos one day. I’m into all kinds of convos — especially the ones that go off-topic and become something better than expected. I prefer voice notes and music-sharing over memes, and I love learning about literally anything I don’t know. Recently, I’ve been diving into the importance of minimizing inflammation through food and recovery (nerdy, I know — but it's fascinating).

If someone handed me $10k and said, “Go live your best life,” I’d be on a one-month tour across Europe, soaking in architecture and food. And if I had to pick a song for my life soundtrack? “To Build a Home.” I really value transparency — no sugarcoating, just real talk. I’m somewhere between a “text me daily” and “catch up when it feels right” kind of person, and I like staying in touch through voice notes, texts, and random life pics. Most people don’t guess that English isn’t my first language, or that I’ve got a mixed ethnic background — but I love when those kinds of things spark meaningful convo.

With a lot of effort and few tools, he released his first game on Steam: Angry Bean, through the indie studio he created with a friend, Dead Queen.

The game even attracted curiosity: more than 30 thousand views on the Steam page. But... only 6 sales (all friends).

I'm currently staying with my grandmother to care for her after a surgery. She doesn't actually need much from me so I'm acting as personal chef and butler.

This morning I made us our respective breakfasts and coffee. We sit down and chat about our day, what plans we have for dinner, upcoming appointments, etc.

I made a small joke about how I know everyone loves her but I think I must love her just a little more. She looks at me and smiles before telling me how important love is. How her moms generation was different and she felt like she never had enough hugs or kisses so when she had kids she gave them all the love she could. Apparently my mom and her sisters had a conversation about how my grandma must have missed out on hugs and kisses because she always gave them in abundance. And so we had a chat about generational trauma and how much I see the changes her (and even my very flawed grandfather) made in their own lives to break curses. How I see it in my own mom and what my other grandma does.

It's not just the hugs and kisses. It making sure daughters are educated and have means to be self sufficient. It's about building adult relationships and taking accountability. It's about hard but honest conversations.

These are the curses my grandmother broke, the curses my mom is breaking, the curses I am breaking.

And we can talk about it over a casual weekday breakfast.",11,1748438436.0,WitchesVsPatriarchy,2,0.92,False

I hit the ground hard, one hand on my belly, pain exploding through me.
He ran over—my husband, the man who once swore to protect me.
And kicked me like garbage.
I screamed, holding my stomach, but he didn’t even look at me. His eyes were on the woman beside him.
""Nancy, baby, are you okay? Did she hurt your hand?""
""That bitch must be blind,"" Nancy snapped. ""She got in my way. I should’ve slapped her harder.""
Declan turned to me, eyes cold. ""How dare you touch her?""
Then he hit me.
People started gathering. I curled up, blood soaking through my dress.
Someone shouted, ""Where’s her husband? Stop him! She’s pregnant—she’ll lose the baby!""
If only they knew—my husband was the one beating me.
...
""My baby…"" I whimpered, reaching out. My hand grasped the leg of his pants, trembling. ""Declan… it’s me…""
He looked down for a second. Something flickered in his eyes.
Recognition?
Doubt?
Hope flared in my chest.
But then he grabbed me by the hair, yanked my head back, and slammed his fist into my jaw.
Blood spilled from my mouth, warm and metallic. My vision swam.
He looked down at the stain I’d left on his pants and sneered. ""Disgusting.""
Then, louder, so everyone could hear: ""You really thought I'd pity you? Look at yourself. You think you're good enough to touch me? ""
Another blow, this time to my stomach. I screamed as white-hot pain spread through my entire body.
""You’re nothing,"" he spat. ""Compared to my Nancy, you’re dirt. A worthless piece of trash that doesn’t even deserve to breathe the same air.""
The pain was unbearable, like knives slicing through my organs. I was bleeding, bruised, broken—and more than anything, shattered.
I was his wife.
We had a marriage certificate. A home. A baby.
We shared a bed every night. I knew every scar on his body. I knew how he liked his coffee. I knew the sound he made when he dreamed.
In high school, I fell into a freezing river, and he jumped in without hesitation, nearly drowning just to save me.
When I had the flu, he stayed up all night, holding my hand, feeding me soup, wiping sweat from my forehead.
When we were broke, we shared a single bowl of ramen, and he always gave me the last bite.
When he started making money, he bought me everything I so much as glanced at. Jewelry. Shoes. A new kitchen because I once said I hated the countertops.
He never let me do chores. He hired a nanny and a maid because, he said, I shouldn’t have to lift a finger while carrying his child.
There were countless moments that told me—he loved me.
Just yesterday, he curled into me and whispered, ""I love you. You, me, and our little one—it’s all I ever wanted.""
And today?
He tried to kill us both.
Was everything we had… a lie?
Was our marriage—our love—just an illusion I desperately clung to while he planned my destruction?
Declan Rhodes, the man I trusted with my life, had become my worst nightmare.
And as I lay in a pool of my own blood, our baby slipping away from me, I realized—
I didn’t know him at all.
He kissed Nancy’s forehead gently, like she was made of glass. ""That woman dared to upset you today. To make up for it, why don’t we buy out the entire new collection?""
""You're the best!"" Nancy giggled and kissed him on the cheek, shooting me a smug look that made my blood boil.
He carried her toward a black luxury car gleaming under the sun like sin on wheels.
As the door opened, a wave of pain shot through me—but so did rage.
No.
No, I wouldn’t let him leave. Not after everything.
Fueled by heartbreak and betrayal, I dragged my bloodied body forward, one hand reaching out with everything I had left.
""Declan!"" I croaked, my voice hoarse and raw. The trail of blood I left behind snaked across the pavement, dark and damning.
I pounded on the car window. Through the tinted glass, I saw his face twist in disgust.
""You’re still alive?"" His voice was sharp and cold. ""Are you trying to die?!""
The door flung open, slamming into me with brutal force. I hit the pavement hard, something inside me cracking—maybe a rib, maybe my heart. I didn’t care. I needed answers.
I clawed my way forward again and gripped the car door.
But Nancy’s voice chimed in sweetly, ""Ignore her, baby. She’s just a ghost begging to be buried.""
She yanked the door shut.
My coat got caught.
The car roared to life.
I screamed.
The engine drowned out my cries as the car sped forward, dragging me along the asphalt. Skin tore. Heat and pain exploded through me. I felt every inch of that road scrape into my bones.
My body was nothing but fire and agony, dragged for what felt like forever.
When the car finally stopped, I was barely conscious. My breath came in shallow gasps. The silence in my womb was the worst of all.
I couldn’t feel my baby anymore.
When I finally opened my eyes again, I was greeted by the stark white of the hospital ceiling. The sterile scent of disinfectant filled the air, and nurses rushed around me in a blur, their voices a dull hum in the background.
For a moment, I thought I had been saved.
Suddenly, a cruel voice cut through the silence.
""You’re lucky to be alive, but you’re still useless. Your corneas are healthy, though—maybe it’s your honor that Nancy can use them.""
Declan’s voice, cold and cruel, echoed in my ears. ""You’ve really done a good deed, haven’t you? Alleviating my Nancy’s eye condition. You should be thankful.""
Every word he spoke was like a dagger to my chest. I fought to breathe, my throat raw from the pain, but all I could do was whimper in desperation. ""Please... save our baby...""
I reached out with trembling hands, my fingers gripping the hem of his shirt, begging with every ounce of my soul. I didn’t care about my life anymore, I just needed him to save what was left of me—our child.
For a moment, he hesitated, but then he shoved my hand away with disgust. I tumbled off the bed, my broken body colliding with the floor. The pain exploded again, each crack in my bones felt like being hit by a truck.
""Crazy woman!"" he spat. ""Who do you think you are? Don’t touch me! Just wait for your worthless self to rot! You’ll die just like you deserve!""
A doctor, standing nearby, couldn’t stay silent anymore. ""Mr. Rhodes, her injuries are critical. The baby’s in danger. If we don’t perform surgery now, there could be serious complications.""
He glanced at the doctor, fury burning in his eyes. ""Why should I care about her? She’s already dead! And as for her, she’s just a corpse waiting to happen! The surgery is for my wife, not for her!""
The doctor fell silent, the fear in his eyes unmistakable. I looked at Declan, my rage and resentment boiling over. But the pain from my injuries was too much. The needle went into my arm, and before I could even react, the world faded into nothingness.
When I woke again, the world felt unreal. The coldness in my body mirrored the numbness in my soul. I had been through the worst physical pain imaginable, but nothing compared to the agony of losing my child.
I couldn’t see clearly. My vision was a blur of blood and gauze. I reached for my baby, my hands shaking as I groped for what was left of the tiny life I had carried inside me.
The cold in my hands was nothing compared to the coldness in my chest. The world outside felt far away, but the loss... the loss was suffocating.
I silently vowed that I would make them pay. I would make Declan pay for the life he had stolen from me. For the love he had turned into a lie.
While Nancy lay cozily tucked into a private VIP suite, I was dumped outside her room like medical waste, lying motionless on a gurney in the cold hallway.
I couldn’t see, but I could hear everything.
Inside the room, I could hear Declan’s voice—soft, doting, dripping with fake affection. It made my stomach turn.
""The surgery went well, baby. Your eyes won’t hurt anymore,"" he murmured sweetly to Nancy, like some loving husband straight out of a romance novel.
""You’ve been through so much. I’ll make it up to you. Once you’re discharged, we’ll go abroad. I'll take you to the best auction—whatever you want, it’s yours.""
I bit down hard, my nails digging into my palms until I drew blood. The pain grounded me. Reminded me I was still alive. Unfortunately.
Then—
""Madam!""
The familiar voice sent a jolt through my chest.
""Madam! What happened to you?""
Soft, trembling fingers brushed my swollen face. ""Oh my God... your eyes... what happened to your eyes?!""
""It was just groceries! You only went out to get groceries—how did it come to this?!""
It was Betty Miller. My nanny. She’d only been with me for two years, but she saw me—truly saw me—without hesitation.
Unlike Declan, who’d lived with me for over two decades and still looked at me like I was a stranger.
So tell me, Declan, who exactly do you see when you look at me?
The door flew open.
""What the hell are you doing out here?"" Declan barked, storming into the hallway like a madman.
Betty didn’t move. She was still kneeling at my side.
""What are you crying for? She's fine. Don’t bring bad luck into the hallway.""
He grabbed her arm harshly, yanking her back. ""Why the hell are you wasting tears on this bitch?""
""The woman you’re supposed to be taking care of is in that room,"" he snapped, pointing toward Nancy's door. ""Go near her again, and you’re fired.""
Betty didn’t flinch.
She looked up, calm but resolute. ""Sir, I think you’re mistaken.""
She turned back to me, wiping the dried blood from my face with shaking hands.

But instead of listing specs again, let’s talk about what really matters:

What could this power station actually do in real life? Let’s imagine a few moments together 👇

🕯 Power Out? You’re Still Lit.

The neighborhood goes dark. But your fridge is running, your router’s on, your kids are watching cartoons, and you’re sipping hot coffee from your still-working coffee maker. Not magic—just the HomePower 3000’s built-in UPS doing its thing.

🏕 Camping, But Make It Comfortable

You're out in the woods under a sky full of stars. You've got warm lights strung around the tent, a portable heater running, and a movie projected onto the side of your RV. The power? Quietly coming from your HomePower 3000.

🛠 Fixing Up the Cabin? No Grid? No Problem.

You’re doing renovations in a remote cabin. No electricity? No issue. You’ve got power tools, lighting, even your coffee grinder—everything running off the HomePower 3000.

☀ Off-Grid with a Solar Sidekick

Hooked up to a few SolarSaga panels, your HomePower 3000 charges silently in the sun. By night, you’re fully powered without ever touching the grid.

💭 Your Turn: How Would You Use It?

Let’s make this a brainstorming thread:

How would you use the Jackery HomePower 3000?  A mobile workstation?  Outdoor movie nights?  Charging your e-bike on the go?  Something weird and wonderful?

First few dates, he always cancels last minute. We knew each other for more than a year but we only had a coffee date. He says he is busy with work. I am too. Every time I try to tell him he just tells me he is sick and he will make it up to me. 
And then he will reply to me after few days, longest was a month and a half. He just casually say, hey, how are you? Like he didn't notice the gaps on his replies. 
He never wanted to talk about things, every time I ask what his favorite color or anything that you need to know to date someone he just says ""let's talk about that when we meet"" but bitch, when?
He doesn't have emotional intelligence at all. 
One time, he told me that he is on his way to me but never texted the whole night. So he made me wait the entire fucking night.
Oh and I once tried to surprise him but he was so infuriated because of the surprise. It was disappointing.

Second was when he decided to just go to my place in the middle of the night at 12mn just to hook up and he left after few hrs and third the one where i surprise him and drove to another city for him but he got mad. 
I totally dont talk to him much after that. But he kept coming. And then i decided to tell him i dont want to see him but after few months he then decided to message me and pretend that nothing happened. He blocked me for few weeks, btw, but he pretended that he didn't. Now he is trying his best to win me over again but I think, I'm just staying just for the sake of it. I don't really get bother by it anymore.
But somehow, i wanted to see if he changed.

How to change that ?","I (26F) have been friends with another girl (25F) for a long time. We’ve known each other since primary school, we went through middle and high school together, went on vacation trips with other girls, etc etc.

Then I moved away to another city for college and we would only see each other when I’d come back for holidays. In the meantime, she formed a group of friends back home. I know those guys pretty well and really appreciate them. They’re fun, and we really get along. I’ve known them for over 7 years now.

I would say I am more of a satellite to their group, though. I am invited to birthdays, new year’s, summer weekend trips, but I am not part of their group per say.

First of all, I don’t think I’ve ever hung out one on one with one of them - except for my childhood friend, who I go for coffee with from time to time. We’re buddies, but I’d never initiate a text conversation with them one on one if there wasn’t an explicit purpose. They have a group chat, obviously, which I’m not a part of. They also have a yearly summer tradition where they go to one of the girls’ home in the south - she tried to invite me a couple of times at parties, but it felt like a big deal and never really panned out as it was never mentioned again.

It’s not a thing where I feel excluded or anything. They just have a close-knit group where daily interactions are a thing, and I was not there when this routine was set, so I’m not a part of it.

I’d really love to be a part of their group though. I have recently come back to our city and I plan on staying here. We enjoy each other’s company and I don’t have this kind of group of friends in my life, and I miss it.

However, I just don’t know how to make it happen. Some people have joined their group in the time I’ve known them so I know it’s possible but…. I just don’t know how. Just asking « can I join the groupchat ? » is too pathetic for me to even consider.

I guess I’ll have to be vulnerable at some point and be like « hey, I really like you guys, I’d love it if we got to hand out more often » but I don’t know how to go about it. I want to join their routine but I can’t do it if I’m not invited to things.

I was invited to one of their birthdays’ on Saturday (kind of as an afterthought I have to say) and as I was leaving one of them was like « hey, are we seeing you on Wednesday? We’re having a barbecue ! ». So just like that, I’m going there tonight. I have hope that this is a step in the good direction ? But yeah, I’m mostly clueless when it comes to relationships.

Does anyone have any advice for me ?

I'm a 28-year-old guy living on the West Coast (PST), and honestly, I’m just looking to meet cool, grounded people for spontaneous conversations that flow — whether they’re deep, weird, funny, flirty, boring, or a bit of everything.

My ideal weekend? Starts with a workout or a hike, followed by a croissant and coffee, maybe a beach trip, and ends with a BBQ. I’m a morning person through and through, and nothing starts my day better than a freshly brewed coffee. I don’t have pets (yet), but I dream of owning two Cane Corsos one day. I’m into all kinds of convos — especially the ones that go off-topic and become something better than expected. I prefer voice notes and music-sharing over memes, and I love learning about literally anything I don’t know. Recently, I’ve been diving into the importance of minimizing inflammation through food and recovery (nerdy, I know — but it's fascinating).

If someone handed me $10k and said, “Go live your best life,” I’d be on a one-month tour across Europe, soaking in architecture and food. And if I had to pick a song for my life soundtrack? “To Build a Home.” I really value transparency — no sugarcoating, just real talk. I’m somewhere between a “text me daily” and “catch up when it feels right” kind of person, and I like staying in touch through voice notes, texts, and random life pics. Most people don’t guess that English isn’t my first language, or that I’ve got a mixed ethnic background — but I love when those kinds of things spark meaningful convo.

She had been living with high blood pressure for most of her life. That day, she visited me while I was working from home. We talked, had coffee, and suddenly — everything changed. She screamed out with pain, said her head hurt in a way it never had before, and asked me to call my dad. She refused to go to the hospital, thinking it was just another bad day. But it wasn’t.

I did call the ambulance. They came, helped her, and took her to the hospital. Five days later, she was gone.

There’s so much I wish I could undo. I wish I had called sooner. I wish I’d seen the signs. I keep asking myself if I could have saved her. But I also know my dad came quickly, and we were both with her.

Since then, I’ve moved back to be with him and my grandmother — to care for them the way she always did for all of us.

1kxgr22,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kxgr22/steam_kickstarting_issue_brevillesage_barista/,Steam Kickstarting Issue [Breville/Sage Barista Express],"Hi everyone,

I´ve recently started taking up the repair of Breville/Sage machines as a hobby and have just come across a weird issue, which is why I´m asking for advice.

The machine was clogged and I cleared out the clogged tubes & heating element. Adjusted the OPV, as the previous owner cranked it all the way in in hopes of ""forcing"" the water to flow (which resulted in a blown teflon tube), and made some nice coffee.

The issue:

When selecting steam on the valve, the machine goes into ""steam mode"" (valve is working and the pump is pulsing). However, there is almost no steam exiting the steam wand. The weird thing is that when I select hot water for just a second and then go back to steam, there is a huge amount of very hot steam exiting first through the hot water spout and then through the steam wand. This goes on for around 10 seconds, after which the steam wand goes back to barely producing steam. Valve works fine for the wand and spout in descale mode.

I´m suspecting that the pump is not pushing enough water to the heating element in ""steam"" mode but the ""hot water"" setting pushes some water to the now overheating heating element, which is why there is a lot of steam coming out for a short while.

Any Breville/Sage experienced people that could point me in the right direction?

My boyfriend is a self-taught amateur game developer and dreams of making a living from it. He was recently laid off (we're really poor, so it was a blow), and decided to use the three months of unemployment benefits to do what he loves: develop a game.

With a lot of effort and few tools, he released his first game on Steam: Angry Bean, through the indie studio he created with a friend, Dead Queen.

The game even attracted curiosity: more than 30 thousand views on the Steam page. But... only 6 sales (all friends).
Now he's in that cruel doubt: the money is running out, he's going to have to look for a job again, and the dream is on hold.

That's why I came here to ask two things:

1. Real tips: where and how do you promote indie games with almost zero budget? Is it worth continuing?


2. Moral support (or maybe a little wishlist...) – The game is there, it costs less than a cup of coffee. And if anyone wants to help by taking a look, that's great!

If a lawyer managed to convince a judge to sue McDonald's because they don't like the CEO's face, good on them, and I hope they get a lot of money.  I'm of the opinion that most of the serious problems in the US are connected to corporations gaining too much power: the power to buy politicians, the power to write their own regulations, the power to dodge accountability and make it so the rules that apply to the rest of us don't apply to them.  

This is *not* a ""something unfair happened to the poor widdle corporation"" opinion.  If something unfair happens to a giant corporation that has minimal impact on ordinary people, *good.*  This is a ""this decision and legal precedent negatively affects life for *ordinary citizens*"" opinion.

Cutting through all the media sensationalization on this case, the basis of it was that the coffee McDonald's served was too hot.  By itself, this isn't necessarily frivolous.  We are not in the days of ""let the buyer beware;"" a company can't sell you a sandwich with a razor in it, which you then consume and are injured, and blame you for not checking the sandwich before you ate it.  It is perfectly reasonable to sue a company for selling a product that a reasonable person would not expect to be dangerous that turned out to be dangerous.

But coffee is expected to be hot.  If I make coffee at home and spill it on myself, I expect to be burned - maybe grievously burned if it's fresh and I spill a lot of it.  Coffee can burn you, like knives can cut you or electricity can shock you or falling off your roof can break your bones.  Hazards exist in our day-to-day lives, and it's not the fault of the company that manufactured my kitchen knife if I cut my finger off with it.  If I cut my finger off with a plastic children's toy because it has an unexpected metal sharp edge in it, then that *can* be the fault of the company, but knives are expected to be sharp - like coffee is expected to be hot.

That doesn't mean there's not such a thing as *too* hot (or too sharp, or too much electrical current, etc.).  I'd argue that's hard to reach with coffee: *boiling* water for coffee is a typical way to make it.  But if a regulatory body established, like the lawyers in the McDonald's case argued, that coffee should never be warmer than lukewarm, then McDonald's would be in the wrong for violating that regulatory law.  I could even see it being justified when serving beverages to someone in a moving vehicle: maybe coffee or tea you get in a drive-thru or on a train or on a plane *should* be limited to lukewarm.

But there was no such law.  If you drive 45mph in a 45mph zone, an officer has no business writing you a speeding ticket because he believes that it *should* be a 30mph zone.  If it should be 30mph, they need to write the law first, *then* penalize individuals if they violate it.

Again, I have absolutely no qualms with McDonald's being unfairly sued.  If an individual wants to sue them for not following a regulation that doesn't exist, I hope they win big.  But the problem is that this affects how other companies act.  If you can be sued for not serving lukewarm coffee, then you can be sued for selling sharp kitchen knives.  You can be sued for selling a cleaning agent that's poisonous if you drink it.  You can be sued for selling reasonable merchandise that someone might hurt themselves with, and so you don't.

The only reason you can still buy hot coffee, or sharp knives, or functional stovetops, or anything else that a person might accidentally harm themselves with, is because McDonald's believes that the lawsuit was a ""fluke,"" and it seems that most of the business world agrees.  Similar lawsuits are not likely to be taken seriously, and companies do not need to make manufacturing decisions around imaginary regulations protecting people from their own actions.  But if these kinds of lawsuits were routinely taken seriously, it would cause significant problems for day-to-day people.

The McDonald's lawsuit was bad not because it was unfair to McDonald's (it was, but who cares).  It was bad because, if taken seriously, it means that you should not be able to buy useful things that could potentially injure you, and it financially incentivizes companies not to sell such things to you.",0,1748437643.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,22,0.2,False

4) work on your physical and mental health. Physically get in the gym, take walks, get you some 10lb dumbbells and do some at home workouts. Mentally get you a therapist, journal, read islamic affirmations anything that gets your mental health in order 
5) Far too many posts about unmarried  people lacking fulfillment and feeling incomplete. Complete yourself first and then attract another complete person to share life with. 
6) Throw away these arbitrary checklist that you have . Because all you’re doing is limiting the dating pool and perhaps disqualifying a bunch of potential spouses.  Who cares if a man is 6’3 if he’s not on his deen. Who cares is a man make 6 figures if he’s mentally unstable. 
7) diversify your search . Personally I’m not a fan of dating apps but to each their own. But don’t rely solely on them. Travel to different masjid, attend Islamic lectures, conventions and events. Utilize other sisters who may have connections. 
8) Allah is merciful and forgives us for our 
shortcomings . You should too. 
9) love who loves you, pay attention to who pays attention to you. If he isn’t paying you no mind he’s not the person for you sis . Be persistent but don’t be annoying …

We were visiting friends up in Antrim, staying nearby in an Airbnb. 

We’d been there for six hours, she was drinking a lot of cocktails and I had had one beer at the start of the evening, followed by a load of non alcoholic beers, a couple of coffees and then I had one Irish cream and whiskey shot at the end. 

We drove home and she was very drunk. 

We missed dinner I guess so I was going to get a takeaway but the Chinese in the nearby village didn’t take card and to be honest, she had gotten into bed in her PJs as soon as we got home, I knew she wouldn’t be awake by the time I went and got cash and collected a takeaway. 

That was 10.30pm, and I went to bed about 1am. 

At 4am she woke me to get her water, I did. 

At 5.30am she told me I was snoring really loudly so I moved rooms. 

At 6am she came into me saying it was 9am and I should get up, I’d be late to log on for work, I was so tired but I knew it wasn’t 9am. She then said it was 10am and I should get up and make her breakfast. I kept saying I needed to sleep. 

She went and got a glass of water and laughing as she did it, threw it on me as I was warning her not to. 

We argued and I went back to the dry bed in the other room and said I needs to sleep and to leave me alone. 

She started pulling the covers off me telling me to get up and make her breakfast because I had deprived her of dinner. 

It was 6.15am or 6.30 am and I was so tired and I refused. Why couldn’t she make her self some breakfast???

She went and got another cup of water and I was yelling not to do it. But she did. 

I just saw red, I jumped out of bed and pushed her hard out of the room, but she was standing firm. 

I didn’t punch her, or thump her, I just pushed so hard. She didn’t fall or hit anything. 

I closed the door but she came back in, she was shouting at me that I had broke a nail on her hand and said she had marks on her chest. 

I went In to the other room to keep away from her but she kept following me for more confrontation. 

I decided it would best to get all my stuff and leave, just get away. 

But she took that to being me abandoning her and wouldn’t let me leave. But I had to, it was going to get ugly. 

I was trying to pack stuff and both of us had our phones on video record, me for my protection, her so she could say I was attacking her still, I wasn’t!!!!! 

She grabbed my phone and threw it at the wall. 

I saw red again and I went to grab hers from her hand but she was holding it tight. She screamed “I’m sorry I’m sorry” and I let go but I had hurt hand trying to get it. 

The phone had accidentally called emergency services, but she didn’t hang up, she just let them listen as we argued and she kept saying stop attacking me, while I was frantically trying to pack all my shit and get the hell out. 

But she wouldn’t let me leave, she kept trying to get my stuff and stop me. 

She was pulling my hair to distract me so she could grab stuff but was shouting stop pulling my hair for the benefit of the 999 call. 

I got down the stairs and she followed and she took the key from the door and ran back up. 

That’s when she started talking to the 999 person and  they said they were sending someone. It was actually me who gave them the address, she didn’t know it. 

I begged her for the key, I even said she could have my car key in exchange, I just needed to get out of the apartment and not be near her. 

The police arrived, and I went outside and they questioned me
And they also questioned her upstairs. 

I showed them the recordings and what she had done and I told them that I had pushed her. 

The frmale officer was tuned in and started asking me questions about being in an abusive relationship and based on what they saw, they arrested me for common assault and her for domestic abuse. 

But I only found out they had arrested her when I was on the way to the station. I broke down, because I didn’t want her to be arrested, I knew I had overreacted to what she had done. 

She got a solicitor, I declined. 

Her solicitor asked her if she wanted to press charges, she didn’t.

In my interview I was categoric about not pressing charges against her. I gave them a full account in 15 minutes. She said she was in and out in 5 minutes. Not sure if relevant. 

I waited three hours after the interview and eventually they let us both go with Community Resolution Orders, in other words we had to apologise to each other. 

I did apologise to her but she refused to apologise to me. I asked her if she would do it again throw water over me to wake me up and she said of course she would but it was a joke and I overreacted.

The next day she came out of the bathroom that morning and was pointing at a bruise on her chest and was demanding. I apologise again. I know I should have put instead I can feel myself getting angry because she hadn’t apologise to me and I wanted to leave I told her I needed to have some space But she wouldn’t let me.

That was yesterday and now she’s not talking to me. And quite possibly we may never speak again.

I know I was wrong to react the way I did, but should she be accountable for her actions? ",0,1748437461.0,abusiverelationships,2,0.5,False

I love the hot tub and have invited her every single day, just trying to find something we can enjoy together.

Last night, I talked up the idea again. She seemed into it when we talked. After our kid’s baseball game, I asked if she still wanted to hot tub—she said no.

So instead of doing my own thing, I chose to stay close, hoping we’d just spend some time together. She was on the couch, watching TV and scrolling her phone. I tried to engage, to sit with her and be present. Eventually, I said—half flirty, half hopeful—“I’m going to shower so we can get dirty.”

After I showered, I came back trying to be affectionate, playful, still holding on to the moment. But she was watching the weather. I waited. Then came “the final weather”—which didn’t even change—and that couldn’t be missed either. I gave up around 11:39 and told her I was going to bed.

She said, “I’ll be there in a minute.”

Ten minutes passed. I sent a text. No response
 Ten more. I called her.
She said, “Yes, I’m on my way.”
She came to bed at 1 a.m.

She has no idea how long “a minute” is. That wasn’t just a brush-off of intimacy—it felt like a rejection of all the effort I’ve been putting in.

This morning, I didn’t make her coffee. I barely spoke to her, other than to tell her there was an accident and she should take another route to work.

It just sucks. I keep reaching out, and it feels like I’m always the one trying. This isn’t even about sex—it’s about connection. About showing up for each other.

And the hardest part is… my heart still reaches for her, even when all I get back is empty. I’ve been trying for so long, I honestly don’t know how to stop.",12,1748437299.0,DeadBedrooms,11,1.0,False
1kxghlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/January2025Bumper/comments/1kxghlp/sleep_training_this_weekend_very_poor_sleeper/,Sleep Training this Weekend / Very Poor Sleeper / Sharing for Solidarity,"Hi everyone. I don't post in here too much but I wanted to share my situation regarding sleep in case anyone is in a similar boat. I also feel like typing all this out might help me, and I like the idea of this being a smaller subreddit with a very specific userbase. One of the reasons I haven't posted in here much is because my son's sleep has been so poor that whenever I read posts about longer stretches, it would genuinely make me sad for my household, haha. 

So here goes! Our son was born on January 27. Healthy, full-term, I was induced and ended with a c-section. When they pulled him out, the nurse anesthesiologist chuckled and said ""he's already looking all around!"" While we were in the hospital, every single nurse, doctor, tech, visitor commented ""he is so awake, alert, and aware!"" I'm just setting the scene for you. 

We quickly realized he was not a sleepy newborn. He would stay awake for hours at a time. I have a vivid memory of when he has just turned 4 weeks and my in-laws came to meet him. He stayed awake for 6 straight hours. Not even fussy or cranky, just wide awake. We wanted to do the whole nine yards - put down drowsy but awake, sleep in the bright living room with noise around him, etc. But trying to follow the recommendations resulted in zero sleep for our newborn. So we decided it was more important to just get him to sleep any way we could. It took a bit but we learned he would go to sleep with very vigorous rocking, bouncing, and shushing. So that's what we started to do for every single sleep. 

Once we could get baby sleeping, he would not sleep in his bassinet or his crib. He would either wake up immediately, or wake up 10 minutes later. But in our laps he would sleep for hours. 

You guessed it - we started exclusively contact napping. On maternity leave, it wasn't so bad. He was so small and we would spend the day basically nursing, he would nap, and I binged TV. I never got to sleep during the day since he only contact napped, but I was okay with that. 

Nights were up and down. He would do better in his crib, but not great. My husband and I did shifts so he took the first few hours of the night and I took the second half. We were both still not getting enough sleep, but we were surviving. Our son would do maybe about an hour in his crib, on a REALLY good night he'd do two hours. But I spent most nights in the rocking chair in his nursery, rocking him for hours while he slept. 

I think we survived on adrenaline those first two months, because we were tired but not falling apart. Yet. 

Things started to rapidly deteriorate at the 2 month mark. We had to stop swaddling and that led to a string of very bad nights. He was less inclined to sleep in his crib. We found ourselves spending more and more time constantly rocking in the nursery throughout the night. 

At about 10 weeks, I was REALLY struggling. This is when the sleep deprivation hit. And ever since that 2 month mark, each week has gotten worse and worse. We tried some of the gentle sleep training methods that are appropriate for newborns/3 monthers, like pick up and put down. It did not change a thing. 

For the last month, my husband sits in the nursery from 8pm-1am, rocking our son as he sleeps and I try and sleep in our room. At 1am, we switch. I am back at work (high school teacher) and husband is on his parental leave. I try to get to sleep at 8, but I usually fall asleep at 9. I get about 4 hours of sleep a night, and my day starts at 1am. 

So, the sleep deprivation. I have never felt like this before in my life. My head constantly hurts. My knees and back are killing me from the bouncing and rocking. I have days where I physically cannot move quickly - it feels like I am trying to walk through syrup. One night I was changing my son, and I left him on the changing table to go across the room for something. I realized my mistake and ran back to him before he could roll off. When I drive, I have to keep my eyes open as wide as possible. During the day, if baby is content on his playmat, I take that time to lay on my back and zone out for 10 minutes next to him. I drink more coffee than ever before in my life. My husband is so worn down and stressed. For the first time in our entire relationship, I heard my mild-mannered, stoic, chill husband actually raise his voice in frustration. It was literally WEIRD hearing him so frustrated, that's how uncommon it is. We do a good job of splitting the work and tagging each other in when we need breaks, but if one of us is sick or out of it, this entire elaborate routine for sleep will crumble. 

We took him to the pediatrician a few times to rule out any health issues. We've also tried everything. It is darkly funny when coworkers, who mean well, suggest things like ""have you tried white noise and a sleep sack?"" Again, I know people are just trying to help, but it is clear our reality is so far from theirs. 

I've gone deep in understanding infant sleep. I've read Precious Little Sleep, the Ferber book, and Cribsheet. I spend a lot of time on the sleep training subreddit. I've talked with my friends who have older kids, and many of them sleep trained with good results. It is clear to me at this point that our son has deeply engrained sleep associations, and that he literally does not know how to sleep on his own. He essentially has only ever been held for all sleep. 

So he had his 4 month appointment yesterday. He did great. Good growth, head control looks good, got his vaccines. We told the pediatrician about our situation and if we could maybe start sleep training. She enthusiastically endorsed it and said ""this is not sustainable, do what you need to do to get him used to his crib."" 

Thus, we start sleep training on Friday. After much discussion we settled on cry it out. We don't think check-ins will help, he would most likely just get more worked up. We feel like he is showing signs of wanting his crib - squirming and wiggling in our laps, rolling over and preferring his side, etc. I am nervous and not looking forward to hearing my son cry. But we truly are out of options. Cosleeping was never an option for our family. 

My biggest fear is that it won't work. I don't know how we will survive if this doesn't work. I am not expecting a miracle or for him to start magically sleeping 12 straight hours. I just want him to do some decent stretches in his crib. 

So if any other January parents are in the same boat, I get it. I wish you all sleep and peace. ",3,1748437282.0,January2025Bumper,11,1.0,False

He wants a break up but doesn't leave?,"Last week I went to lunch room make some coffee while at work and one of my coworkers decided to join me there. He is a very talkative type, can talk your ear off for hours on end. To clarify, he does this to everybody, not just me, and also I am not attracted to him in any way. He starts telling me some random stories and I only managed to get away in a little over an hour. I didn't want to stay that long but I guess I'm not good at politely exiting a conversation when I need to. 

So I get back to my workplace where I left my phone (because I initially though I'd be back to in in 5 minutes so I didn't take it with me) and I find out that I missed a couple of texts and a call from my boyfriend. He offered some corrections to a presentation I sent him earlier and wanted me to review them. I called him back, said that I got stuck talking to my colleague. He is upset with me because I didn't answer for a long time.

I rush home after work to find him still upset. I apologize for not taking my phone with me and accidentally missing his call. He doesn't care for my apology, says I'd feel awful too if he was talking to a female coworker for that long. After a couple of minutes he starts going off about how he'd love to have someone he could listen to for hours (like I did that day), someone to have deep conversations with, someone who would inspire him. He tells me I'm not that person and that he wants to be alone (as in, to break up). It all came out of nowhere for me and, as I usually do, I try to talk him into trying to fix whatever is bothering him. He tells me that he is sick of our sense of humor and that we only talk about funny stuff because I'm indifferent to anything serious. The evening ends with silence. I'm left feeling like all our happy times were a lie and that he secretly hated them but pretended to make me happy or something. I'm confused.

Several days have gone by since then, he didn't leave for some reason but things didn't get back to normal either. He is acting distant. It's just so weird to me that a person could go from being very affectionate and talking about getting a house together to a ""I dislike you and I want to be alone"" in a span of a day. I think I should just give him what he wants and offer to let him go and stop fighting for us. I just have to gather up the courage to do it, as it will crush me.

My cofounder and I had a problem we'd been discussing for a while: travelers want better recommendations. Not SEO-choked listicles. Not fake influencer recommendations. Real, local insight. Something raw and trustworthy that helps you experience a city like you're with a friend who lives there.

We went the old-school route first. We built a very low-fidelity prototype: literally a Google Maps list with 100 places in Bangkok we peronally recommended. We weren’t trying to build tech yet, we just wanted to validate one thing: do these kinds of recs resonate?

They did. People loved the vibe. The tone. The type of spots. We got DMs saying things like “Used your list 3x last night to great success. Best night I've had yet!”

But here’s the thing—it didn’t feel like a step-change in how people travel. We weren’t changing how people explore a city, just giving them a better list. We were stuck, with hard decisions. We’re product folks, we had a vision, but we're not devs. We considered:

* Should we raise a pre-seed round?
* Should we hunt for a technical cofounder?
* Should we hire an agency to prototype something?

Every option was not ideal... Then AI tooling blew up, and Bolt came onto our radar. Instead of writing docs and waiting, we jumped on the “vibe code” train.

Three days. Three Bolt accounts. Lots of coffee. And we had it: a working version of our core vision. It wasn’t perfect. But it had onboarding, a rec engine, maps, data logic, Supabase integration. It worked. It existed. With a couple tweaks from a friend who codes, we turned it into a shareable prototype.

Total cost? $300.  
Time to launched product? 6 weeks.

That’s insane. A few years ago this would’ve cost us $20k and six months with a dev shop.

This new era is changing everything about being a builder

But that also means our leverage has changed. Execution isn’t the bottleneck. Knowing what to build is. And going to market.

Right now we're in the GTM phase, feels like this is the real challenge (as it always has been once you have a product).

But either way, this new tech an equalizer. Especially in markets like ours (we’re building this from Southeast Asia), where the cost of engineering talent has long been a major barrier. Suddenly, we don’t need to be in SF. We don’t need millions. We just need to be close to the problem and build for our segment.

We’re building something raw, real, and for the traveler who wants culture over checklists. If you care about:

* Exploring cities through the eyes of locals
* Replacing gamed recommendation engines with curated, lived experiences
* Building in public

Have you also tried new building no-code dev tools, any learnings from how you've validated ideas and launched real products?

And that’s when it hit me:

**This is exactly what Personalized Marketing should feel like.**

Not pushy. Not robotic. Just simple, intuitive, and relevant.

But in the digital world, how do you replicate that kind of personal touch for thousands — maybe even millions — of customers?

**The answer: AI.**  
It listens, learns, and adapts — just like that barista.  
Only this time, it scales, and it never forgets a name, a taste, or a pattern.

**Marketing cracked — thanks to the AI detective behind smarter campaigns..**

When I first uploaded our customer database into an AI tool, I wasn’t expecting anything extraordinary. But the insights that came back? Eye-opening.

It was like hiring a detective who had been secretly watching every click, scroll, and pause on our website — and then presenting a full report.

“Your weekday visitors behave differently than weekend ones,” it said.  
“People from colder regions tend to prefer Product B over Product A.”  
“Customers who read reviews spend 40% more.”

It wasn’t just data; it was a story. A *map* of human behavior, painted with ones and zeros. Suddenly, I saw our audience not as a list of leads, but as people with habits, moods, and timing.

**Marketing meets AI — campaigns that write themselves.**

One night, after a long day, I tested the AI’s campaign builder feature. I selected a product, hit “Generate Campaign,” and watched in awe.

Within minutes, it created:

* Tailored email template
* Social media captions optimized for each platform
* Suggested timings for each post based on audience activity
* Even subject lines A/B tested by predictive models

It was like having an entire creative team in my laptop — minus the coffee breaks.

I sent out the emails, skeptical. But the next morning, my dashboard lit up: **open rates doubled**, click-throughs spiked, and sales rolled in.

I didn’t just save time. I launched smarter.

**Marketing Ads That Adapt Like a Chameleon.**

Instead of static ads, we launched dynamic creatives. One customer saw a happy family using our product, another saw a sleek, minimal look. Each visual and message was adapted based on who was watching.

Our ROI didn’t just improve — it tripled. By customizing the experience for each individual, we created a sense of connection and relevance that traditional ads couldn’t achieve. The power of AI allowed us to deliver the right message at the right time, making each interaction feel uniquely personal. What’s more, the data from these campaigns helped us continuously refine and optimize, ensuring even greater success moving forward.

**Conclusion: From Coffee Shops to Campaigns — The Evolution of Personalized Marketing .**

That coffee shop didn’t use AI. But it understood personalization — making every interaction feel familiar and relevant.

AI helps brands do the same, just at an enormous scale. It’s not about replacing human touch; it’s about enhancing it.

Because in the end, the best marketing doesn’t feel like marketing — it feels like being remembered.

First few dates, he always cancels last minute. We knew each other for more than a year but we only had a coffee date. He says he is busy with work. I am too. Every time I try to tell him he just tells me he is sick and he will make it up to me. 
And then he will reply to me after few days, longest was a month and a half. He just casually say, hey, how are you? Like he didn't notice the gaps on his replies. 
He never wanted to talk about things, every time I ask what his favorite color or anything that you need to know to date someone he just says ""let's talk about that when we meet"" but bitch, when?
He doesn't have emotional intelligence at all. 
One time, he told me that he is on his way to me but never texted the whole night. So he made me wait the entire fucking night.
Oh and I once tried to surprise him but he was so infuriated because of the surprise. It was disappointing. 
1 and a half years in but we jusy saw each other for like 3 times only. One, was a coffee date for 2hrs coz he cancelled (yet again) the date we plan the day before so he said let's finally meet. Second was when he decided to just go to my place in the middle of the night at 12mn just to hook up and he left after few hrs and third the one where i surprise him and drove to another city for him but he got mad. 
I totally dont talk to him much after that. But he kept coming. And then i decided to tell him i dont want to see him but after few months he then decided to message me and pretend that nothing happened. He blocked me for few weeks, btw, but he pretended that he didn't. Now he is trying his best to win me over again but I think, I'm just staying just for the sake of it. I don't really get bother by it anymore.
But somehow, i wanted to see if he changed.

However, when I changed the sheets, I noticed a stain on the pillow cover-not the pillow case but the cover over the pillow itself-and  a larger brown spot on the waterproof cover I have over the mattress, and also on the fitted sheet, a larger brown stain in the same area. 

I'm miffed because I was never told about this. I don't know if my pet made the stains, although this would had to have been during the night because the comforter wasn't stained, or if the sitter did it accidentally. I don't even know if it perhaps was coffee! As a female, I know all about menstrual accidents, which is what they, and this one are--accidents. No blame and no judgement. We all have bodily functions.

Accidents happen, but please tell me. If you as the sitter made the stain, please offer to replace at least. I'd likely say no, but it would be nice to have the offer. And if my pet did it, I definitely need to know because this is abnormal behavior.

This does teach me, however, after many wonderful sitters in my home, that I should put out cheap sheets for the sitters. The ones I had are a bit more expensive (100% cotton), so I'm out some money on this.

Then he talked about getting a coffee maker and keep it in my room. I said my dad would allow him to use his, but he insists on buying his own and putting it in my room. My room is only a 11ft by 9ft room. I have a twin bed and a play pen for my ferrets. There is little to no room and there's no shelf space. 
He really upset me when I said that he would make the space. Then proceeded to tell me that if he sees the layout and has a vision, he will rearrange it and I will like it. 
I asked him to not rearrange my room because it is my room and it's how I like it. I was willing to compromise by allowing him to give me suggestions of what to change and I'll consider it. But again, he insists he moves it as he please. 
He believes that it is OUR space. While technically it is, since we are both staying in there together, it's still my stuff and my parents house. I explained how it upset me and I told him that hes overstepping his boundaries. I understand that he wants to make it feel like home and I want to make it comfortable for him too.

I usually purchase 500g to 1kg beans and have it grind at my local roasters (they use a big grinder but I have no clue what it is). This usually last me for a month!

My current budget is somewhere around $100 (not fixed). I haven't justify whether buying an expensive grinder would help elevate my taste. I still cannot clearly identify the difference between the taste of beans that grinder a month ago versus freshly grind beans. Currently I enjoy my Yirgacheffe coffee with the floral and fruity profile. I have tried Kenya AA but did not get along (didnt like the sour taste). After trying pour over with various beans in the last 5 months (Colombia Huila, Ethiopia G1, Sidamo, Indonesia Gayo), I think I prefer something that isnt too acidic, that taste fruity and floral (like the bean I currently have) and roast profile of light to medium

These are the grinders I'm looking at and hoping for some guidance on which to chose (one of them is an electric grinder) 

Timemore S3 ($90 here)
Timemore Whirly 01s ($110 here)
1ZPresso X Ultra ($120 here)

I’m trying to get the Context Chat app working on my self-hosted Nextcloud instance (running via Nextcloud AIO in Docker). I want to use the new in-document AI search and chat features, but I can’t get the document indexing process to work end-to-end.

**What I’ve done so far:**

* Nextcloud AIO is running fine via Docker Compose.
* I installed the [Context Chat app ](https://github.com/nextcloud/context-chat)from appstore, and it loads in Nextcloud.
* I can run `php occ context_chat:scan <user>` and it detects all my files.
* However, none of the files actually make it into the vector database.

**Diagnostics:**  
The Context Chat diagnostics in the CLI show:

    1
    2
    3
    
    
    Content provider    | Queued documents | Documents in vector database
    ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------
    files__default      | 1250             | (out of 0 sent)
    
    

**Errors received:**

* When running scans or other commands, I get errors like:CollapseRunCopy 1   Error received from Context Chat Backend (ExApp) with status code 500: Vector DB Error: Error: failed to load sources  
* Also, when I tried the diagnostic command, I saw:CollapseCopy 1   Error: Call to undefined method OCA\\ContextChat\\Service\\DiagnosticService::getBackgroundJobDiagnostics()  

**My observations/troubleshooting:**

* I suspect my backend isn’t running or isn’t connected correctly.
* I only have the main AIO container in my docker compose file; there’s no context\_chat\_backend or chromadb service.
* I see lots of docs “queued” but zero ever get “sent” or indexed.
* I haven’t added the actual vector DB backend (maybe that’s the problem?).

**Questions:**

* What’s the minimal Docker Compose setup to get Nextcloud Context Chat working with its backend and a vector DB?
* How do you wire them together (networks, URLs, config)?
* Anyone else seen the diagnostic PHP error? Is it a version mismatch, or was it recently fixed?
* Any tips on debugging document processing “stuck in queue” for this app?

Any guidance, example compose.yml files, or step-by-step would be *greatly* appreciated!

**Details:**

* Nextcloud AIO version: [**Nextcloud Hub 10**](https://nextcloud.dustin.coffee/) **(31.0.5)**
* Context Chat app version: 4.3.0
* Host OS: Ubuntu 24.04 (Proxmox VM)

Since last couple of days I’ve been facing with an unfamiliar issue with my puck from Flair 58+. 

I use usually High flow basket with Blind shaker for coffee distribution + little WDT to eliminate big lumps from the upper layer. 

Standard dose with my 2 current coffee types  was 17 Gramm, and everything was perfectly aligned (work flow and grind settings), blooming time was ~10 seconds + extraction within next 15-20 seconds with pressure deterioration from 9 to 6 and then to 3 bar. 

And last 5-6 brews I receive always the same result - coffee grinds goes above and through the puck screen directly to the brewing chamber while I’m adding the hot water. 

After brewing there are some channeling, and the basket is being very messy (see attached photos). Result is the same with 2 different coffees (first anaerobic and second washed) 

What could be the reason of it? Could there be any issues with puck screen, should I go even finer with my grind settings or the problem lies on the puck preparation?

Having a coffee with my players over lunch and the topic of droids, particularly crew droids. So tonight I opened up the Robot's Handbook PDF, as they are the only ;books' I have, as I figured that would be the quickest option and just scrolled through the Robot Catalogue and found what I was looking for (*we were out having coffee so I couldn't look it up straight away*).

That's fine, ok. Now getting back to being new to MgT2 after decades of CTing, I'm not in a hurry to read and understand all the supplements just yet until I have the Core Rules down pat from front to back, so to speak. So I haven't read *anything* from the robot book so I don't know how to make them and such just yet, that will come later.

What I'm seeking is understanding about the robot speed listing. Our crew robot has a speed of 6m, cook, makes sense. I noticed there was an Astro-Mech Droid and got shades of Star Wars vibes though it looks nothing like a Star Wars droid and see it is wheeled with a speed of 5m, fine. But I noticed the two Mules, the wheeled and grav version, have no speed listed, just a long dash? The descriptions of both droids give no indication of any kind of speed, just what it can carry and the like. Why is this and what would the speed be. Again, am I missing something here as a new MgTer?

Sorry to bother you all again, but as I've said a few times here already, you people are some of the best at setting someone new to particular rule sets right (*because I never knew the book something was in or just made an error in reading the MgT2 text, or whatever*) in a prompt fashion and are amongst the most helpful.

2. The people taking part are the head roasters of coffee shops across PVD (some are also the owner of the business as well)

3. The space is limited so I've been taking ""RSVPs"" on the ProvMidShift instagram which has been linked and a QR code posted in our reddit thread a few times!

4. The event is expected to only be an hour and a half long (7-8:30) but folks can hangout, mingle and enjoy the bar at NH until they close if they so choose!

5. The Q&A portion is most likely going to be 10-15 minutes at the end, unless more people have questions then I will cut down the panel time

6. The event is for industry people! Current baristas, roasters, production team members, owners of coffee shops.

Just saying.,"Figma is great and all, but not Adobe. My brain, under a microscope, is wired to use Adobe. It actually gives me a headache to do the same graphic design job in two different companies’ software, especially when they have different ways of working and shortcuts.

I’m not complaining. I hate monopolies and I love that a small company like Figma has achieved what it has.

But honestly, I would rather do everything either in Figma or Adobe, not both at the same time.

I understand I have to use Microsoft and sometimes Google, even log in to Canva for clients. But having to use Figma instead of XD just feels like Adobe let us down — not just XD, but across the board. I thought they had our backs.

So what’s the real deal? Is it the end of creativity and now everything is going AI project management at Adobe?

Again, I’m not complaining, it’s all good. I live near a beach, so I don’t really care. Just give me a coffee and I’ll be quiet.

But I still work, and I have to use design tools. So what’s going on Adobe? Is web design just not a thing for you anymore?

Figma is great and I’ve learned most of the shortcuts, but I would just prefer one main suite with consistent shortcuts and a consistent user interface. After all, aligning typography and images in a grid system is pretty similar whether it’s a magazine, a flyer, a social post, or a website. Not exactly the same, of course, but it’s all visual communication. It’s 2025, AI is great, but we’re not there yet.

I guess this is a rant. I’m not an Apple, Figma, or Adobe fanboy — just a human with hands and a brain.

I’m investing heavily in Figma now, but my gut tells me this is illogical. Adobe XD was just more “Adobe.” That’s all.

Please bring it back. All is forgiven. I’m sorry I complained about the ridiculous “standard save as going to cloud” shortcuts, im sorry i moaned about the cloud, makes a lot of sence now seeing Figma use it, and other crazy updates. But please just invest that 10 to 20 billion dollars you have lying around into XD. Pretty please?

Or just go full Ai or Full amateur, This professional space is getting really weird to navigate. 

Either im missing the point, or something is about to be released that does everything, or is this classic empire to big to pivot stuff, or probably all three?

maybe i am “”overreacting”” because i haven’t had the opportunity to eat breakfast yet (actually i have had the opportunity, but i didn’t want to when i could, so now i have to wait) so i am processing information with 2 cups of coffee, some water, and 150mg extended-release venlafaxine in my system.

i was sitting on my bed trying to decide what to do until i can have breakfast, hungry and kind of weirdly pine-y and emotional, and i get a text from my boss at my second job. or, what i am trying to make my second job (for the summer). she messaged me like? last thursday? regarding work hours and i did See it but i did not open it or respond because i was probably tired when i did see it and immediately filed the monumental task of typing a sentence or maybe two in response under “too many steps” and then forgot, and then when i remembered a couple days had passed so now what would have been a tiny thing is now a Bigger thing and i’ve made it Way Harder for myself to put myself into motion and actually do the Thing (which will take me maybe 30 seconds to complete once I am actually “in motion”). So this last sunday i finally mustered up the fortitude to actually message her (instead of just thinking about it). and now this morning she has gotten back with me. and i guess after i am typing it out now i can kind of see why she would have such a response. because the outcome of just thinking about something but not actually being able to get yourself to do it is the same as if you just aren’t doing the thing. only its not because i don’t care!!!! i do care i’ve been thinking about starting work there again the whole time!!!!! i just couldn’t get myself to type some words on a screen!!!!!! 

so here is part of what she said:

> “I am apprehensive to continue trying to put you on the schedule as it has been a few weeks now of not knowing how serious you are about this position. 

> I'll admit my communication hasn't been perfect but I have a lot going on and need to have reliable people showing up who are eager to work hard. 

> At this point I hadn't heard from you and you didn't show up last week with no notice so I went ahead and made arrangements for Thursday and Friday this week and have enough help. “

and i think, first of all…. i am expected to be “serious” about a part-time seasonal job that pays me 14 USD an hour? i applied to this job for the summer for funsies. i just wanted a fun and interesting second job for the summer (it is on a small farm operation). 

also… few weeks? its been like a week. “a few” is like three (as opposed to “a couple” which is two). i find her rhetorical choices of her text message to me rather curious. “reliable” and “eager”? i understand the imperative for any petit-bourgeois “small business owner” to be able to extract as much labor as possible from an employee so as to remain “competitive”, but her chosen adjectives suggest that it is expected of me to repeatedly ask if and when i will be scheduled, instead of having a schedule dictated to me and adjusting myself to that. i think it is completely reasonable for me to assume that she, as the owner and effectively my manager, will be the one creating a schedule week after week after i have been hired and informed her of my availability. if it is instead my responsibility as an employee to repeatedly ask for my scheduled work week, WHY can she not just TELL ME DIRECTLY that it is expected of me, instead of making me wonder in-between communication from her. 

i also think i may have either misunderstood or forgotten that (if?) i had been scheduled last week. in my last exchange with her she told me what work hours would work best for me to work. i think i understood this as simply a statement about my hours *generally*, while she assumed that i would infer that those hours would be applicable without her explicitly telling me that i Would be working them.

1kxfyvf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kxfyvf,Something's Brewing from Yemen: How Coffee Became Popular in Colonial Madras,"**Part I: What's in a Cup? A Lot Apparently**

When it comes to history of coffee consumption in southern India, especially in Tamil regions, clearly something was brewing. Indeed the common stereotype of TN being primarily a coffee consuming state has a lot to with the history of a staple that came rather late to the Subcontinent and one which is imbued with a particular set of caste dynamics that persist in popular culture to this day. This post is a cultural history of how coffee became prominent in colonial Madras based primarily on the wonderful essay *In Those Days There was No Coffee* by the scholar AR Venkatachalapathy. This is an interesting history where we begin along the shores of Yemen where (along with nearby Ethiopia) we can trace the origins of this now ubiquitous staple worldwide. 

**Part II: An Indian Ocean Brew**

Let's start with the science as to what do we mean by coffee and its varieties botanically, which is as follows:

>The two main species of coffee are *Coffea arabica* (a tetraploid) and *C.camephora*. A mutation induced in the latter (a diploid) using colchicine yielded the tetraploid called *C.robusta*, which is sturdier but yields a brew that has less flavour than *arabica*. Crosses between them, called *arabusta*, imbibe the best from both parents.

As maybe apparent the term *arabica* clearly hints at the origins of the coffee plant in the Yemeni highlands. Indeed one of the iconic forms in which coffee is served as a beverage borrows its name from the city of Mocha in Yemen from where the crop was exported globally. Indeed coffee made Mocha so wealthy, that it served as the primary port of the Zaydi Imams who were based in Sanaa and controlled the Yemeni highlands where coffee was produced. Indeed it took until colonial times when Mocha's influence waned drastically as that of Aden increased. **However during the period it maintained its importance, it was a bustling port with an intimate India connection** as seen in this description by the historian Nancy Um:

>In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, Mocha’s port welcomed a wide range of ships from trade routes originating below the Jidda gap. Every year the first ship from India was awaited with great anticipation, because it marked the beginning of the trade season... **A
veritable pipeline of maritime traffic ran from the Red Sea to Gujarat, particularly between Mocha and Surat. Together these cities functioned
as twin ports along a maritime highway. Although vessels arrived from other Indian ports,** such as Cambay in Gujarat,... **Mocha’s trade depended on the constant flow of goods and merchants along the Mocha-Surat route.** Some vessels that traveled this route may be defined as official or royal ships. **The Mughal emperors and other members of the royal family sent ships from Surat to the Red Sea laden with cargo and carrying pilgrims destined for Mecca via Jidda. These ships stopped at Mocha to replenish supplies and unload goods before continuing to the Hijaz. Trade activity overlapped with pilgrimage activity,... Furthermore, the Zaydi Imam of Yemen sent two ships from Mocha to Surat yearly.** Following the natural calendar of the monsoon winds, ships from India began to arrive as early as January and continued to appear throughout the spring. They sailed eastward in August, leaving Mocha’s harbor relatively empty by October.

Clearly Mocha gained a large part of its prominence and bustle from the India trade, but what were these goods and commodities that were being vigorusly traded? And where does coffee fit in here? On these questions we know the following:

>**Textiles constituted the key Indian manufactured commodity of the port. Made in the production centers of Gujarat, the Coromandel coast, and Bengal,** the textiles represented a multitude of varieties, styles, and qualities, **a range reflecting the huge market for Indian cloth in Yemen and other parts of the Middle East.** Spices from India and Southeast Asia included cloves, pepper, cardamom, mace, turmeric, cinnamon, dried ginger, and nutmeg. Various bulk metals arrived in Mocha, many of which, such as tin, copper, steel, lead, and iron, were transshipped from East and Southeast Asia. **The vessels that carried
these eastern goods to Mocha returned to the Indian coast carrying loads of bullion and cases of specie shipped from the Mediterranean for reminting into Mughal coins in India.** Other items that returned to India were ivory from the African coast, medicinal products such as aloe, local aromatics, and dye materials such as wars, a Yemeni plant that produced a yellow pigment. **During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, coffee was shipped from Mocha to Surat mainly on European boats.**

The last line is of particular importance as it tells us who the initial consumers of coffee in the Subcontinent were, as noted by the culinary historian KT Achaya (who coincidentally was from Coorg, a region famous for its coffee plantations) that:

>The bean seems to have reached India even earlier, because in 1616-19 [Edward] Terry wrote that:

>>**many of the people who are strict in their religion use no wine at all. They use a liquor more healthful than pleasant they call *cohha*: a black seed boiled in water, which doth little alter the taste of the water.** Notwithstanding, it is very good to help digestion, to quicken the spirits and to cleanse the blood.

Edward Terry was the chaplain to the English mission which came to the court of the Mughal emperor Jahangir, and made these observations c 1616-17. Clearly one can see it was beverage used by those who wanted to circumvent the religious restrictions surrounding another more infamous beverage, alcohol. Initially the drink was limited to those circles along with a class of Europeans where cafe culture spread like a craze around this time, and indeed which became a major site of intellectual discussions in the run up to the Enlightenment later in the 18th century. However the spread of coffee in India from then on was not inconsiderable as seen from the following accounts recorded by Achaya:

>About 1700 Hamilton records an invitation from the Nawab of Thattah (in Sindh) ‘to take a dish of coffee with him’.

Indeed coffee's roots in southern India too have a Middle Eastern, though expansion of cultivation only took pace with the colonial and the rise of plantations in the hills of what is now Karnataka, where as Achaya notes:

>Arabs had introduced coffee planting m Sn Lanka even before the Dutch invasion **in 1665. In that same year a coffee plantation is recorded in south India, though berry quality was stated to be inferior. About 1720, a Muslim divine called Baba Budan returned from a pilgrimage to Mecca with seven coffee seeds; these he planted outside his cave in the Chikmaglur hills,** where the descendants of the original plants can still be seen. **From about 1830, a rapid development of coffee estates occurred,ed by Cannon in Chikmaglir and Cockburn in the Shevaroy Hills, and shortly thereafter also in the Nilgiris**

And so began coffee cultivation in southern India, though native consumption of the beverage remained modest, as Venkatachalapathy notes:

>Though coffee was possibly being raised in the Mysore region **even by the eighteenth century, it was largely a beverage for Europeans. Most of the produce found its way to the market in London, while a small part of it was consumed by Europeans here. Even at the turn of the twentieth century, Ayothidas Pandithar, the radical dalit intellectual, refers to coffee as being the drink of Europeans.**

However this was not to be the case for long in Tamil speaking regions as the beverage spread like wildfire there shortly, especially among certain social classes as we shall see. On a side note as a Malayali, those of us on the other side of the Ghats continued to be mostly tea drinkers, especially black tea or *kattan* in the local slang.

**Part III: Rise of the Filter**

Indeed while the consumption of coffee in Tamil households was in many ways socially caste coded, as we shall see shortly, observers at the time could not but help observe how coffee became a hit across social classes in Madras:

>**By the early twentieth century, references to the use of coffee crop up often. For instance, F.R. Hemingway, in the *Tanjore Gazetteer*, writes, ""Among the higher classes coffee in the morning...is taken.... Of recent years however a tendency has become noticeable among Shudras, even of the poorer classes,** towards the use of coffee in the early morning in preference to cold rice.""

Indeed coffee replaced older more traditional staples of choice such as neeragaram, with such changes not being without their rather vocal critics:

>**Coffee began to gradually displace neeragaram, especially in the countryside.** Made by fermenting water drained after cooking rice, and adding water and salt to taste, **neeragaram's demise was lamented by many intellectuals a sign of their cultural anxiety.** In a 1914-chapbook titled *Englandu Kappikkum, Indian Palayathukkum Nerntha Chandai Chindu*, 'Cold Rice' accused 'Coffee' of marginalising curd and buttermilk; even coolies had ceased to take neeragaram, demanding coffee in its stead... **The chapbook that we referred to earlier, it may be noted, poses a contrast between English coffee and Indian soaked rice (palayathu: leftover rice soaked in water overnight and consumed in the morning). In the debate between the two, Cold Rice personifies Coffee as an immoral woman,** who has led people astray and disturbed the (fasting) austerities connected with amavasai, karthigai and ekadesi.

Indeed initial voices of opposition came not just from publications of the Brahmin community but also those from the other side such as from the *Thani Tamil* (Pure Tamil) movement, elements of which too saw coffee as an intrusion in the Tamil lands:

>**Maraimalai Adigal,** the father of the Pure Tamil movement and known for his puritanical views on culture, **made arguably the most forceful plea against coffee and other beverages:**

>>**In the last few years some obnoxious stuff has emerged as eatables: coffee, tea, cocoa and liquor.** Many people have begun to consume the decoction of coffee, tea or cocoa four times a day, in the morning, at noon, in the evening and at night. Even the country folk who never knew this drink have learnt to drink these beverages and now proclaim that they cannot live without them!""

Indeed such opposition had a gendered element, with women being viewed as repositories of culture, transmitting such culture to subsequent generations, with coffee being viewed by such conservatives as an unwelcome intruder in the domestic sphere:

>A correspondent wrote to Gandhi:

>>**The greatest obstacle in the way of success to our [non-cooperation] movement in Madras are our women. Some of them are very reactionary, and a very large number of the high class Brahman ladies have become addicted to many of the Western vices.** They drink coffee not less than three times a day, and consider it very fashionable to drink more.

However for all this initial opposition, coffee proved irresistable in its appeal as a marker of status among an emerging middle class and those seeking to emulate them, where as Venkatachalapathy notes:

>As Adigal rued, 'People who claim accomplishment in education, wealth and culture have begun to see the consumption of beverages through the day as both indispensable and a matter of pride."" **Therein lay the secret of the success: coffee and tea were becoming cultural markers which distinguished the 'high' and the 'low'-a phenom- enon that figured in Tamil society through the cultural practices surrounding these stimulating beverages. Drinking coffee came to be tied to a whole range of cultural practices. In fact, coffee for instance, became the touchstone of hospitality. Every guest to a Tamil middle-class home was offered a cup of coffee.**

However coffee both as a sign as modernity as well as a status marker brought its own contradictions and tensions in Tamil society as we shall see.

**Part IV: Much Ado About Coffee: The Politics of Coffee**

A lot of the literary references to coffee from the early 20th century reflect many of the social dynamics of the time:

>In the fictional writings of the 1930s and 1940s, we find any number of instances of coffee being offered to guests. **It should be remembered here that most of the writers of this period were Brahmins with just a sprinkling of non-Brahmin upper castes, especially the Vellalars.** ...Bad coffee, as designated by the Brahmin middle class, was the butt of many jokes. A self-proclaimed expert on coffee had this to say about coffee served at one particular cafe: 'A liquid was brought, in a cup of hot water something like milk was added to something black with something like sugar sprinkled upon it."" 

>**Good coffee could be made only with cow's milk-with all the ritual importance associated with the cow in Brahmin discourse.** R.K. Narayan emphatically declared that 'Only pure milk, untampered and taken straight from the cow could be a true coffee component."" **Making coffee with buffalo's milk was a sign of cultural and moral degeneration. Coffee made with unadulter- ated cow's milk, quite popular to this day in Thanjavur and Kumbakonam, is still referred to as 'degree coffee'.** 

Indeed such social dynamics also played in the practice of how filter coffee was served, including the iconic steel glass and tumbler combo:

>**The widespread use of metal tumblers with rims, unlike the rimless North Indian ones, is a Tamil (Brahmin) invention: enabling the drinking of coffee without sipping the tumbler, it facilitated the balancing of hospitality and avoiding ritual pollution.** It has been observed that taking coffee or tea was considered legitimate even where caste restrictions came in the way of commensality.

Indeed such social coding of coffee as a status marking beverage extended to the establishments where it was consumed, whose development was tied to another iconic southern Indian culinary insitution, the tiffin room:

>With the widespread use of coffee in Tamil society, **a new institution, popularly referred to as 'coffee hotel' or 'coffee club' which served coffee (and not tea) along with what was called 'tiffin' emerged in the towns and cities of Tamilnadu.** This phenomenon was widely noticed and commented upon from the 1920s well until the 1950s... **The Tamil equivalent of the *Devil's Dictionary* [an early 20th century version of Urban Dictionary] was more blunt when it defined a coffee club as 'A public tavern instituted by Brahmins. A messenger from God to break Brahmin orthodoxy'.** A.K. Chettiar, a keen observer of contemporary culture, wrote in a lighter vein:

>>**The coffee hotel is one of the most indispensable things for human society**.... Some find it difficult to cajole their wives to entertain friends at home. Such persons seek refuge in coffee hotels. **The coffee hotel is not just an eating joint. In villages it is a place of congregation.**

>Chettiar's elaborate account of this phenomenon points to the institutionalisation of coffee in Tamil society. **What is missing in this account however is the fact that the coffee hotel was generally run by Brahmins, and in the popular mind, was associated with Brahmins. ""*Iyer! Bring me a cup of coffee*"" was a cry that was heard often in coffee hotels. In fact, some hotels were called 'Brahmanal Hotel'**-a practice whose vestiges can still be found in out of the way mofussil towns.

Indeed so prominent were they as social markers that they became one of the sites of contest with the emergence of intially the non-Brahmin and later the Dravidian movement:

>When Bharatidasan, the fiery poet of the Dravidian movement, once wanted to criticise some Brahmin adversaries, he derisively called them *kapi kadai mundangal* (the wretches of the coffee hotels)

Indeed some of this agitation was linked to segregated spaces in these coffee clubs/hotels, which clearly marked the distinction between Brahmin and non-Brahmin and acted as public manifestation of caste, leading to much agitation:

>However, this pride concealed the fact that **a separate space was reserved for Brahmins in coffee hotels which was out of bounds for non-Brahmins. This was a zealously guarded privilege. For instance, in 1933, when the municipality of Pollachi town introduced a regulation to do away with this reservation, P.S. Sivaswamy Iyer opposed it on the grounds that it amounted to ""interference in personal matters.""** It was left to Periyar E.V. Ramasamy to articulate the radical non-Brahmin perspective on this institution: ""Even in the wretched coffee hotels there is no equality. There too hang the boards dividing ""Brahmins"" and ""Shudras""; ""Panchamas"", lepers and dogs not to enter"" **In the historic Self-Respect Conference held at Chengalpat in 1929 a resolution was passed condemning coffee hotels which reserved space for Brahmins and urging local authorities to withdraw licences to such establishments.**
After such discrimination had formally been abolished, Periyar launched a campaign to remove the adjective 'Brahmin' from the names of hotel establishments. **His first successful attempt was at railway canteens where separate sections were designated for Brahmins.**

Thus to paraphrase a marketing slogan from a famous coffee chain, a lot did indeed happen over coffee in colonial Madras, providing us a sneek-peak into the society of the time with its divisions and anxieties. Hope this post stirred some curiosity in your mind.

If you’ve been following along over the last few weeks, we’ve walked through the full story of $ATYR—from the 108-event Development Timeline, to the Dealbook deep dive tracing 28 strategic transactions, to the read-between-the-lines analyses of CEO appearances and market structure mechanics.

But this time, I want to zoom in on something more foundational. The people.

Not just the scientists. Not just the execs. I mean the actual team—the human architecture behind $ATYR. Who are they? What have they built before? And how exactly does this mix of regulatory veterans, immunology pioneers, patient advocates, dealmakers, and launch architects position aTyr for what comes next?

Because if you’re investing in a small-cap biotech heading into a pivotal readout, you’re not just betting on data. You’re betting on the people.  

And this team—if you look closely—isn’t standard.

This post is my attempt to lay it out clearly: who’s behind the wheel at aTyr, what each of them brings to the table, and why I think this group has the depth, cohesion, and strategic composition to carry this through Phase 3 and beyond. These are the people driving aTyr Pharma, and your investment.

## Who Are These People, Really?

A table gives you structure. But people make the story. Below are short profiles of the core leadership, board members, and advisors driving aTyr forward—from the scientific nucleus to the commercial inflection layer. These aren’t resume blurbs. These are the humans behind the $ATYR thesis.

---

### Leadership Team

**Sanjay Shukla, M.D., M.S. – President & CEO**  
A former Novartis VP who built real-world evidence and digital strategy teams from scratch. At aTyr, he led efzofitimod from Phase 1 all the way to Phase 3 and repositioned the company around NRP2 biology. He’s not just the CEO—he’s the architect of its current form.

**Jill Broadfoot – Chief Financial Officer**  
Ex-GW Pharma, Vical, and Ernst & Young. She’s taken companies public, closed BD deals, and held the purse strings through scale-ups and shutdowns. One of the rare CFOs in microcaps with both M&A and manufacturing oversight experience.

**Robert Ashworth, Ph.D. – VP, Regulatory Affairs**  
35 years in drug development. Brought over a dozen drugs through FDA and EMA approval. If efzofitimod gets across the line, it’ll be in large part because this guy knows exactly how to craft a regulatory submission that hits.

**Lisa Carey – VP, Clinical Operations**  
From critical care nurse to global trial director. She’s run Phase 3 trials in cystic fibrosis and hepatitis C—difficult populations, heavy regulatory oversight. She’s a real-world clinical ops veteran, not a theoretical one.

**Dalia Rayes, M.D. – Head of Commercial, Efzofitimod Franchise**  
Strategically pulled from Boehringer Ingelheim’s ILD division. She understands physician segmentation, access hurdles, and the nuances of building a launchpad in rare lung diseases. One of the clearest forward indicators of commercial readiness.

**Peter Villiger – VP, Corporate Development**  
Ex–The Medicines Company. Ran deals, divestitures, and licensing. If aTyr ends up in a partner’s hands (or gets picked off in M&A), Villiger will be a key player in shaping the process.

**Andrea Cubitt, Ph.D. – VP, Scientific Alliances & IP**  
A biochemist turned patent strategist, with stints at Aurora and AnaptysBio. She’s the IP engine behind aTyr’s 300+ patent estate. Not just protecting the science—helping shape it.

**Leslie Nangle, Ph.D. – VP, Research**  
Joined over 15 years ago and stayed through every pivot. She co-led the discovery that tRNA synthetase variants had immunomodulatory roles. If Schimmel is the origin story, Nangle is the continuity.

**Nancy Denyes – General Counsel**  
Ex-Cooley. Specialist in biotech corporate law, equity structures, and governance. She’s been with aTyr for over a decade—rare continuity in legal leadership.

**Danielle Campbell – VP, Human Resources**  
HR leader with experience scaling biotech orgs from inside-out. Previously ran people ops at Poseida and Cytori. Brings institutional memory and internal cohesion.

**Jayant Aphale, Ph.D. – VP, Technical Operations**  
Less public-facing, but essential. Likely overseeing CMC and manufacturing prep. A quiet node in the transition from late-stage trials to post-readout scalability.

---

### Board of Directors

**Paul Schimmel, Ph.D. – Founding Scientist & Director**  
The nucleus. Co-founded Alnylam, Momenta, Cubist, Sirtris. Architect of the tRNA synthetase hypothesis aTyr is built on. Elected to five national academies. His involvement alone gives the platform serious scientific weight.

**Timothy Coughlin – Chairman**  
Former CFO of Neurocrine, where he helped scale to >$10B. Joined aTyr after its market cap collapsed, not when it was hot. That says something. Now Chair, he’s the fiscal and governance backbone.

**Eric Benevich – Director**  
Chief Commercial Officer at Neurocrine. Oversaw Ingrezza’s rise in a rare neurology market—an analogue in many ways to what efzofitimod faces. Tactical, grounded, and launch-ready.

**Svetlana Lucas, Ph.D. – Director**  
Dealmaker at Amgen and Scribe. Helped structure the Kite collaboration. Strategic commercial thinker with sharp biotech instincts. She knows how to package a story for the right partner—or buyer.

**Sara Zaknoen, M.D. – Director**  
Former Novartis oncology leader. CMO across multiple acquired biotechs. Oncology-trained, trial-experienced, and equipped to navigate risk-benefit tightropes. Brings scientific and regulatory realism to the board.

**Jane Gross, Ph.D. – Director**  
Ex-Amgen, Aptevo, Aduro. A scientific heavyweight who bridges immunology, translational development, and biotech scaling. Not flashy—but technically precise and deeply respected.

**Sanjay Shukla, M.D., M.S. – Director (also CEO)**  
Having the CEO on the board isn’t unusual—but Shukla’s dual role lets him link exec decisions with board strategy. That alignment will matter as things accelerate.

---

### Advisors

**Wayne A. I. Frederick, M.D. – Advisor**  
President Emeritus of Howard University. Cancer surgeon. Public health leader. His presence signals aTyr’s seriousness in addressing health equity, especially in diseases like sarcoidosis, which disproportionately affect African Americans.

**Andrea Wilson – Patient Advisor**  
Founder of the Foundation for Sarcoidosis Research. Sarcoidosis patient herself. Her advocacy shaped how the disease is understood and treated in the U.S. and globally. aTyr didn’t just bring her on for optics—they brought her on for truth.

### 1. This is a team optimized for Phase 3 inflection + commercial buildout—not just science

A large percentage of microcap biotechs never graduate past academic proof-of-concept or early clinical signals. Their teams are often composed of platform scientists, early-stage investors, and consultants without proven experience navigating late-stage trial complexity or preparing for commercial scale. In contrast, aTyr’s leadership reflects a deliberate shift toward executional maturity.

- **Lisa Carey** ran global Phase 3 trials at Vertex (Kalydeco for cystic fibrosis) and Wyeth (antibiotics, oncology), including complex, multinational study designs with significant regulatory interface. She’s not just running CROs—she’s fluent in late-stage orchestration.  
- **Robert Ashworth** brings over three decades of regulatory experience, including 12+ successful NDAs/BLAs across immunology and oncology. His presence signals a preparedness for global filings, including strategic engagement with the FDA and EMA.  
- **Dalia Rayes** was hand-picked from Boehringer Ingelheim’s interstitial lung disease division. She is deeply entrenched in the commercial nuances of pulmonary sarcoidosis and fibrotic ILDs, both from a physician targeting and reimbursement standpoint.

**Insight:** This leadership team is not aspirational—they are executional. The makeup of this team implies a deliberate readiness for the specific challenges of post-Phase 3 delivery: regulatory filings, market access design, specialist salesforce calibration, and strategic alliance conversations. They’re not learning on the job—they’ve done this before, at scale.

### 2. The board blends elite platform biotech founders with commercial scalers

The strength of a board often lies not in its average pedigree, but in the complementarity of its expertise. aTyr’s board is striking in its ability to bridge both ends of the biotech value chain: from translational science and IP all the way through commercial monetization and M&A.

- **Paul Schimmel** is arguably the most accomplished academic biotech founder on any microcap board. As co-founder of Alnylam, Sirtris, Cubist, and Momenta, he’s a walking archetype of platform-to-product translation. His presence isn’t symbolic—it represents decades of platform-building wisdom.  
- **Tim Coughlin** brings the discipline of capital stewardship. As Neurocrine’s former CFO, he scaled a company from R&D through commercial success (with Ingrezza) and multiple subsequent portfolio expansions.  
- **Eric Benevich**, also from Neurocrine, led the commercial launch of Ingrezza—one of the rare cases where a specialty CNS drug built real market dominance. His addition (in Dec 2024) is a very targeted strategic layer just before aTyr’s first commercial readout.

**Insight:** This board isn’t a vanity list—it’s a strategic lattice. Schimmel anchors the scientific credibility. Coughlin secures governance and capital discipline. Benevich and Lucas prepare for high-value transactions and commercial rollout. As a group, they convey seriousness and preparedness for scale, rare in a sub-$500M biotech.

---

### 3. Their collective experience spans every major inflection a biotech must face

What makes a leadership team “complete”? Not just titles. It’s functional redundancy across key decision vectors—science, clinical trials, regulatory, IP, manufacturing, commercialization, governance, stakeholder engagement.

- **Clinical:** Shukla, Carey, Zaknoen, Ashworth  
- **Regulatory:** Ashworth, Zaknoen  
- **Commercial:** Rayes, Benevich, Coughlin  
- **Business Development:** Villiger, Lucas  
- **Finance & Ops:** Broadfoot, Denyes, Campbell  
- **IP & Platform:** Cubitt, Nangle, Schimmel  
- **Patient Advocacy & Policy:** Wilson, Frederick

This isn’t an accident. It reflects a slow, deliberate evolution of aTyr’s leadership profile over the last ~5 years. As the company de-risked its science and moved into late-stage trials, it retooled its leadership to match future needs.

**Insight:** aTyr’s leadership structure is highly resilient. It’s diversified across core competencies and overlapping enough that no single individual is a single point of failure. That’s rare in small-cap biotechs, where a single departure often unravels the operating model. This team can absorb shocks—and that’s exactly the kind of durability institutional capital seeks ahead of binary events.

---

### 4. Multiple leadership and board members have deep ties to successful exits—this is not their first rodeo

One of the biggest indicators of strategic optionality in a biotech is whether its leadership has personally lived through high-quality exits. Not just watching from the sidelines, but actively participating in deal structuring, negotiation, and integration.

- **Tim Coughlin** helped lead Peloton through its $2.2B sale to Merck.  
- **Svetlana Lucas** was a principal dealmaker at Amgen (Kite collaboration), Tizona (AbbVie partnership), and now at Scribe—a company designed for exit or IPO.  
- **Sara Zaknoen** has held CMO roles at Ignyta and Cabrellis—both of which were acquired.  
- **Peter Villiger** ran licensing, divestment, and acquisition deals at The Medicines Company (which was itself acquired by Novartis for $9.7B).  
- **Jill Broadfoot** handled commercial transition work at GW Pharma, later acquired by Jazz Pharma.

**Insight:** This team has repeatedly built assets with acquirers in mind. They know what gets acquired, how buyer diligence works, and how to structure assets (indications, IP, geographies) to maximize attractiveness. If efzofitimod reads out cleanly, they’ll be prepared for inbound interest—and know how to drive a competitive process.

---

### 5. A core scientific thread runs through Schimmel, Nangle, and Cubitt—spanning 20 years of continuity

While the leadership team has evolved, the scientific nucleus of aTyr has remained remarkably stable—and powerful.

- **Paul Schimmel** co-founded the company based on his work in extracellular tRNA synthetases—a field he helped define. He still serves on the board and is an intellectual touchstone for the platform.  
- **Leslie Nangle** joined early and has been central to developing the HARS/NRP2 biology that underpins efzofitimod. She’s not an imported CSO—she’s a platform native.  
- **Andrea Cubitt** helped build the company’s entire IP estate, now >300 issued and pending patents. Her dual expertise in biochemistry and patent strategy is rare and foundational.

**Insight:** This is a true platform-origin team, not a licensing shop. The people who discovered the biology are still actively developing it. That’s powerful in two ways: it preserves scientific coherence, and it builds strategic defensibility—especially important as aTyr explores additional indications or partnerships post-readout.

---

### 6. This team is structurally hedged for multiple outcomes—success, partial success, or setback

Unlike single-threaded biotechs that live or die on one readout, aTyr’s leadership is designed to absorb, reorient, or scale based on what happens next.

- If **efzofitimod succeeds**, they have the commercial bench (Rayes, Benevich, Carey) and regulatory/commercial pathway experience (Ashworth, Shukla) to launch or license.  
- If it **partially succeeds**, they can open new indications (e.g., SSC-ILD, IPF) and raise additional capital to extend the runway.  
- If it **fails**, they have strong fallback options: the NRP2 oncology antibody (ATYR2810), strategic IP monetization (Cubitt), and the kind of BD talent (Villiger, Lucas) that can repackage or spin assets.

**Insight:** aTyr is not existentially fragile. Its leadership structure is not just a bet on success—it’s a strategic hedge. That kind of adaptive resilience is what gives long-horizon investors confidence even in binary biotech setups.

---

### 7. The team’s diversity isn’t token—it’s strategically aligned to aTyr’s markets, mission, and legitimacy

This isn’t a team built for a DEI page—it’s a team assembled for real-world engagement in a complex, diverse healthcare landscape.

- **Wayne Frederick** (Howard University President Emeritus) is a high-integrity advocate in health equity and public health—his presence signals legitimacy in communities most affected by sarcoidosis.  
- **Andrea Wilson** founded the world’s leading sarcoidosis advocacy organization. She gives the company authentic patient grounding in trial design, messaging, and trust-building.  
- **Women** hold critical executive and board roles: finance (Broadfoot), clinical ops (Carey), regulatory (Zaknoen), research (Nangle), IP (Cubitt), BD (Lucas), HR (Campbell), commercial (Rayes).

**Insight:** This isn’t performative inclusion—it’s functional strategy. For a rare disease like sarcoidosis, which disproportionately affects African Americans, credibility and engagement with underrepresented populations is a business-critical factor. aTyr’s leadership is unusually well-calibrated for this reality.

---

### So Why Does Any of This Matter?

Thanks for making it this far—this was a long one, I know. But if you take a step back, this post isn’t just a leadership directory. It’s a story.

Every product, every patent, every trial, every partnership—you can trace all of it back to the people making the decisions. The ones negotiating with regulators. Designing endpoints. Deciding which indication to pursue. Choosing whether to build or partner. Planning for scale—or for sale.

This isn’t just a molecule we’re invested in. It’s a company. And that means we’re also invested in the team behind it.

And when you look closely at $ATYR, what emerges is a setup you almost never see at this valuation level:

- Foundational scientists still in the building.  
- Regulatory and clinical veterans who’ve been through real approvals.  
- Commercial leaders brought in before the inflection—not after.  
- Advisors who reflect the very communities this company aims to serve.  
- A board that’s navigated exits, IPOs, and partnerships at the highest level.

**In other words**: this isn’t an aspirational team. This is an executional team. And *in my view*, it’s one of the most important—and most overlooked—parts of the $ATYR story.

### If this level of detail matters to you…

This post took a lot of time. I pulled together 20+ bios, cross-referenced histories, and stitched it into something I hope is clearer and more useful than anything else out there on this team. If that kind of depth is helpful and you want to support more posts like this, here’s the link:

Even small support means a lot—and makes it easier to keep going deep like this.

### What’s Next?

I’ll be aiming to keep a more regular cadence going forward—some big drops, some faster updates, but always focused on giving you something you can’t find anywhere else. I’ve got more material coming together that builds on the full $ATYR thesis, from new regulatory angles to market structure shifts to potential partner overlays.

There’s a lot more to pull down, and I’ll keep digging.

Thanks again for reading—and if you’ve got thoughts, insights, or angles I haven’t covered yet, I’d love to hear them in the comments.

TL;DR I unexpectedly still have feelings for an old flame, but adore my boyfriend. I feel guilty. 

My partner (m30) and I (f29) have been together for almost 7 years. We have a very loving relationship. We’ve had our ups and downs but who doesn’t, we still don’t live together for various reasons to do with work, etc, but we try to see each other at least twice a week and we FaceTime every evening. We have plans to get married and have children, all the usual things. He’s a great guy and I adore him. 

I have a male friend who I had a brief romantic relationship with back in college. We were never official, but we both liked each other a lot, spent a lot of time together, and just generally had a great time together. We were perfect for each other on paper. At the time I was going through some bad health issues which was really affecting every aspect of my life, and at the time he was my one happy space where I could just relax and enjoy myself. Unfortunately, I convinced myself that because I wasn’t in the best space physically or mentally, that he would also be unhappy, and so I called it off. He was devastated at the time. We stayed friends and even after a few months he asked me out again to give things another shot but I said no for the same reasons, and I had already gotten over him at that point. We decided to stay friends. 

Fast forward 8 years, and we have stayed in touch intermittently. We text a few times a year to catch up on each other’s lives, we both have helped each other out with small random things if needed, but we hadn’t seen each other in a long time. I moved back to the city we met in and where he still lives, and we saw each other in passing one day. So we contacted each other and planned to meet up for a coffee, which we did last night. It was a really nice evening, we just chatted and caught up on life, had a great laugh; we still get on very well. He has just entered a relationship and seems very happy. 
What I didn’t expect was to really feel a rush of feelings come back. And I could be wrong, but I got the same vibes from him. We have a lovely connection, it was like no time had passed at all. I have no intentions of bringing anything up with him about this, and chances are because of the nature of our friendship, I may not see him again for a long time. My partner stayed in my house last night, and when I got home I was delighted to see him, but I felt guilt in the pit of my stomach. 
I’m very confused, I love my boyfriend with my whole heart and want to spend my life with him. Is it normal to have feelings like this?

> In 2011, Starbucks rolled out the ability to load money onto a virtual card via their mobile app. purchases made with these pre-loaded dollars earned extra rewards points, which could eventually be redeemed for free drinks. According to their&nbsp;[quarterly report from this March](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/t/0/0/marginalrevolution/~https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/SBUX-3-30-2025-Exhibit-99-1.pdf), through the app pre-payment system and physical gift cards, Starbucks owes almost $2 billion in coffee to it’s customers.
> 
> …The company can treat this money as a 0% interest loan, and with about 10% of funds eventually being forgotten, it’s actually a negative interest loan.

Starbucks can make money on the float and it makes more money as interest rates rise. At $2 billion and 4% they can earn about $80 million annually on the float. Moreover, breakage (some money on the cards is never redeemed) is running at about 10% so that’s another $200 million a year for a grand total of $280 million or a little over 5% of the $5 billion in operating profit. Not a game changer but also not bad for free money.

As interest rates rise, the value to Starbucks of pre-loaded cards increases. So does the cost to users but I suspect supply incentives will dominate here so you can expect to see Starbuck’s pushing these cards.

Bobby Bones, winner of Season 27, wins the category of *Worst winner*.  
In other, equally as shocking news, water is wet.

Whilst Bobby does not have the lowest competitive average for dances (that honour belongs to Kelly Monaco from Season 1 if you do not take into account her Season 15 performances), his lower quality of dance and limited improvement, combined with his sh\*tty attitude, solidified his place here. He won over the likes of Milo, Evanna, Alexis, Juan Pablo, Tinashe… His *Greatest Showman* freestyle is so stupid. I maintain that the reason the “Judges Save” was introduced was to prevent a winner like Bobby from winning again.

There were no other nominations for this category.

Both our winners of categories so far were male winners.  
I wonder if a female will win either of the last two remaining rounds.

We are voting for *Most under-rated winner* today – our second last vote of the game. Winners can be deemed under-rated for a variety of reasons – They scored well but weren’t really impactful, they overshadowed by another finalist, they were from an overall weaker season, the list goes on. Along with your nominations, please list your reasonings – they definitely help people see your perspectives!!

I am in Australia and have stayed up past my normal bed time in the hopes that u/jdessy may be awake to put their nominations in after they were unable to share their impassioned view on Candace’s Contemporary. I hope you see this just as you’re having your morning coffee 😊

I had a thought today - after this category is finished, how would you all feel about doing one **final** vote for BEST, WORST, UNDER-RATED and OVER-RATED **DANCE**... Out of all the winners of each of these categories. It might be fun to put Giles' Argentine Tango against Charli's Foxtrot, Sabrina's Cha-Cha-Cha etc and see which one comes out on top for best, and the same with the other three categories. If that sounds fun, I will run the game for an extra four days. If not, I am happy to end it after this round ends.

But here’s the thing—it didn’t feel like a step-change in how people travel. We weren’t changing how people explore a city, just giving them a better list. We were stuck, with hard decisions. We’re product folks, we had a vision, but we're not devs. We considered:

* Should we raise a pre-seed round?
* Should we hunt for a technical cofounder?
* Should we hire an agency to prototype something?

Every option was not ideal... Then AI tooling blew up, and [Bolt.new](http://Bolt.new) came onto our radar. Instead of writing docs and waiting, we jumped on the “vibe code” train.

Three days. Three Bolt accounts. Lots of coffee. And we had it: a working version of our core vision. It wasn’t perfect. But it had onboarding, a rec engine, maps, data logic, Supabase integration. It worked. It existed. With a couple tweaks from a friend who codes, we turned it into a shareable prototype.

Total cost? $300.  
Time to launched product? 6 weeks.

That’s insane. A few years ago this would’ve cost us $20k and six months with a dev shop.

This new era is changing everything about being a builder

But that also means our leverage has changed. Execution isn’t the bottleneck. Knowing what to build is. And going to market.

Right now we're in the GTM phase, feels like this is the real challenge (as it always has been once you have a product).

But either way, this new tech an equalizer. Especially in markets like ours (we’re building this from Southeast Asia), where the cost of engineering talent has long been a major barrier. Suddenly, we don’t need to be in SF. We don’t need millions. We just need to be close to the problem and build for our segment.

We’re building something raw, real, and for the traveler who wants culture over checklists. If you care about:

* Exploring cities through the eyes of locals
* Replacing gamed recommendation engines with curated, lived experiences
* Building in public

Follow along. We’re just getting started. And feel free to try the product here

Olivia’s POV

 

“Wake up, Olivia,” Mom’s voice echoed in my sleep.

 

I groaned, pulling the blanket over my head. “Five more minutes, Mom.”

 

“We don’t have any more minutes,” she snapped, shaking my leg with a force that made it impossible to ignore. “Get up now, or we’ll be late.”

 

“Mom,” I groaned in frustration, slowly forcing my eyes open.

 

“Don’t tell me you still want to sleep,” she said, standing at the foot of my bed, her hands placed firmly on her hips as she tapped her foot impatiently on the tiled floor. “Other servants are already up doing their duties, but you are still sleeping? Do you want us relieved of our duties?” Mother snapped angrily at me.

 

I sighed heavily, tossing the blanket aside as I dragged myself out of bed. “I’m up, I’m up,” I muttered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.

 

“Anita is staying in the pack house for the weekend, and she has asked that you be the one to attend to her until she leaves,” Mother announced, and my frown deepened. “Why me? Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid?”

 

“Don’t start,” Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. “Get moving. There’s no time for complaining.”

 

I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap.

 

The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn.

 

Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We’d grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future.

 

That was before everything fell apart.

 

My father was one of the pack’s strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect.

 

But everything changed the night of the setup.

 

I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.

 

Anita was there that night. She hadn’t comforted me, hadn’t spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.

 

Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta’s daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.

 

What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha’s sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.

 

I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid’s uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.

 

“Olivia,” my mother called, “I know this isn’t easy, but… we’ve already lost so much. Don’t give them a reason to take more.”

 

I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn’t understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.

 

“Here,” my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. “She asked for this.”

 

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.

 

“I’ll find my mate, and all this will be over,” I whispered, trying to comfort myself.

 

But I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn’t ending.

 

Reaching Anita’s room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I’d fallen, and how far she’d risen.

 

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.

 

“Come in,” Anita’s voice called.

 

I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. “Your coffee,” I said quietly, stepping inside the room.

 

The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man’s voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.

 

There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.

 

I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.

 

“Wait,” Anita said sharply.

 

I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.

 

She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.

 

My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.

 

She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.

 

She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. “What is this?” she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.

 

“It’s the coffee you requested,” I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.

 

“This?” she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. “You call this coffee?”

 

My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. “It was made in the way you like it,” I said.

 

Anita’s eyes narrowed in anger, and suddenly, she threw the hot coffee over my chest and arms, soaking through my dress. The sharp sting of the heat made me gasp, but I bit my lip to keep from crying out.

 

“Next time you serve me garbage like this, I swear I’ll dump it on your face.”

 

Behind her, Louis remained silent, not wanting to interfere.

 

I stood frozen, my frown deepening as the coffee dripped down my skin. My wolf stirred, angry. I could almost hear her urging me to act. But what could I do?

 

“I’m sorry if the coffee wasn’t to your liking,” I said quietly, forcing the words out despite the lump in my throat. “I’ll remake it.”

 

Anita laughed, a light, annoying sound that grated on my nerves. “Don’t bother,” she said, waving a dismissive hand. “Just try to be less useless next time.”

 

Turning her back to me, She turned away, moving toward Louis. She slid onto his lap like I wasn’t even in the room. He pulled her close, barely sparing me a glance before his lips found her neck.

 

“You’re dismissed,” he said, though his voice lacked the sharpness it usually carried.

 

I swallowed hard, nodded, and turned to leave, my heart racing in my chest.

 

As I stepped out of the room, I let out a shaky breath. The humiliation burned as much as the coffee had, but I sucked in a deep breath and gathered my emotions.

 

Making my way back to the kitchen, I met with Bala, Lennox’s personal guard. “There you are. Lennox calls for you,”

 

I frowned. “Did he say why?” I asked, my stomach tightening. Lennox, the eldest of the triplets, rarely summoned me unless it was important. And rarely for anything good.

 

Bala shrugged. “Not exactly, but he seemed really furious.”

 

A lump formed in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. Without another word, I turned and made my way to Lennox’s room.

 

When I reached his door, I hesitated for a moment before knocking. Instantly, His authoritative voice ordered me in.

 

# Chapter 2: Accused

 

Olivia’s POV

 

Pushing the door open, I met a furious-looking Lennox waiting for me. His room was a mess. Clothes littered the floor, shoes thrown to each corner of the room. I was confused to see it in such a state because Lennox is a top-notch man when it comes to cleanliness; he loves everything tidy.

 

The moment he noticed my presence, he turned to me, and our eyes met. I could see anger and hatred for me in his eyes, and this baffled me because, among the triplets, Lennox was the closest to me when we were little. Back then, when my father was still a respectable warrior, he would bring me to the pack house to watch him train, and on various occasions, my path crossed with the triplets. I was just seven years old then, and they were twelve years old, but we turned out to be great friends. In fact, I visited the pack house more often, and while my father trained other warriors, I played with the triplets.

 

But that was before.

 

Before everything fell apart.

 

Just like Anita, they severed all ties, acting as though we had never been friends.

 

“Who cleaned my room yesterday?” Lennox suddenly asked, his voice filled with rage that made my wolf whimper in fear inside me.

 

I swallowed hard in fear and forced myself to speak. “I did.”

 

Lennox’s expression darkened, and he took another step towards me, but out of fear, I instinctively took a step backward.

 

“Then tell me, Omega,” he sneered, his voice dripping with anger, “where is the diamond necklace I kept in my top drawer?”

 

I froze, my heart racing as Lennox’s words sank in. A diamond necklace? I had no idea what he was talking about. My mind reeled, trying to recall if I had seen anything of the sort while cleaning his room. But all I could remember was organizing his scattered belongings, folding his clothes, and dusting the surfaces. There had been no necklace in the drawer.

 

“I… I didn’t see any necklace,” I stammered, my voice trembling as I met his accusing gaze.

 

Lennox’s eyes narrowed. “Don’t lie to me, Omega,” he growled, his tone laced with anger. “The necklace didn’t just grow legs and walk out of the drawer.”

 

“I’m not lying!” I protested, panic creeping into my voice. “I cleaned the room, but I didn’t take anything. I swear!”

 

He closed the distance between us instantly, towering over me with his imposing frame. “You expect me to believe that?” he snapped. “You and your kind are all the same. Thieves and liars.”

 

His words hurt me, and I felt my wolf stir with anger, but I quickly suppressed her. Defending myself against Lennox in this state would only escalate things.

 

“I didn’t take it,” I repeated, my voice steadier this time. “You can search me if you don’t believe me. Check my room. Check anywhere you want. I have nothing to hide.”

 

Lennox studied me, his jaw clenched tight. For a moment, I thought he might strike me, but instead, he turned and began tearing through the room, pulling open drawers, throwing clothes onto the floor, and overturning furniture searching for the necklace.

 

I stood there, my lips pressed together as I fought to hold back my tears. The Lennox I had known as a child, the boy who had taught me to climb trees, The boy who used to teach me how to swim, who used to protect me from his brothers’ pranks, was gone. In his place was a cold, bitter man who saw me as nothing more than a thief and a liar.

 

Minutes later Lennox stopped searching, his breathing heavy as he stood amidst the chaos he had created. The necklace was nowhere to be found. He turned to me, his eyes blazing with frustration.

 

“I can’t find it, Olivia. It’s gone. That was a gift I got for Anita, a gift I wanted to give her on her eighteenth birthday. Do you know how much that cost me?” he asked in anger.

 

I swallowed hard in fear but stood my ground. “I did not take it…”

 

“Lies!” he angrily cut me off.

 

Lennox exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. “This doesn’t make sense,” he muttered. “You cleaned my room. You were the last one here.” His gaze hardened. “Don’t lie to me, Olivia. Where is it?”

 

When I remained silent, his eyes blazed.

 

“You are a thief, just like your father! A thief!” he cursed, and I pressed my lips together, holding myself back from answering him.

 

Lennox’s words hit me like a blow to the chest. A thief. Just like my father. It didn’t matter how hard I worked, how much I tried to keep my head down and stay out of trouble, this pack would always see me as the daughter of a disgraced warrior.

 

“Only two people came into this room yesterday,” Lennox continued, his voice low and sharp, like the growl of his wolf ready to pounce. “You and Anita. So, tell me, Olivia, who else could have taken it?”

 

I stiffened at his words, the pieces clicking together in my mind. Anita. Of course. She had been in his room yesterday. I remembered seeing her standing by his dresser, pretending to admire a framed photograph.

 

I knew Anita better than anyone else. She was cunning, always looking for ways to get what she wanted. I remembered the time she stole a pack warrior’s silver bracelet, only to cry her way out of trouble. Or the time she framed a servant for breaking the Alpha’s Favorite vase, earning the poor girl a week in the dungeons.

 

And now, she had done it again. But this time, I was her scapegoat.

 

Who would dare enter Lennox’s room and steal something so valuable?

 

No one.

 

No one except Anita.

 

But the words were heavy on my tongue. I couldn’t say it. Not to Lennox. If I accused Anita, I’d only make things worse for myself. No one would believe me. Lennox would defend her, just like everyone else did.

 

“I didn’t take it,” I said again.

 

Lennox let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. “You think I’m stupid, don’t you?”

 

I bit back a retort, my wolf growling in frustration. I wanted to scream the truth at him, to tell him that Anita was far from the innocent, perfect girl he thought she was. But I couldn’t. Not without proof. And even if I had proof, it wouldn’t matter. Anita had the triplets wrapped around her finger.

 

“You know what, Olivia?” Lennox sneered, taking another step toward me. “I’m done wasting my time with you. If that necklace doesn’t turn up by the end of the day, I’ll make sure you and your mother are punished. Severely.”

 

His words sent a chill down my spine, but I stood my ground, meeting his gaze. “I didn’t take it,” I repeated one last time, my voice steady despite the fear coursing through me.

 

Lennox glared at me for a moment longer before turning away, his shoulders tense with rage. “I give you until the end of today to return that necklace. Get out,” he growled.

 

I didn’t need to be told twice. I turned and left the room, my heart pounding as I walked down the hallway. Once I was far enough away, I leaned against the wall, my legs trembling beneath me.

 

Anita. She had to be the one who took the necklace. I knew it in my gut. But how could I prove it without putting myself in even more danger? The triplets wouldn’t believe me, and Anita would just deny it, twisting the situation to make me look like the villain.

 

“Here you are, Olivia,” a guard said as he walked over to me. “Levi is looking for you, and he doesn’t seem happy.”

 

The guard’s announcement made my heart sink in fear.

 

“Why? What happened?” I asked, terrified.

 

Joshua, the guard, shook his head. “I don’t know, Olivia, but he is really furious and demanding for you.”

 

Shit! What could it be this time?",2,1748434451.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
