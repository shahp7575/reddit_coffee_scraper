1nqzuif,https://www.reddit.com/r/NameNerdCirclejerk/comments/1nqzuif/honoring_our_everyday_routine/,Honoring our everyday routine,"Some back story: Every morning without fail, my husband makes me a cup of coffee while I toast him an everything bagel. We then tell each other a joke, even as basic as a knock-knock joke, to start the day in a good mood. It may sound basic or cringe, but this is our sacred routine. It grounds us. Brings us together. 

This morning, after usual laughs we got into a discussion of naming our future child. It was a brief discussion, because we ended up on the name Bagel. It’s warm, round, and pairs beautifully with everything, literally. We could even spell it Beighal, so it looks more like a regular name, but honestly it's good by itself already. 

After my husband went to work that day, my cousin called me. When I excitedly told him about our decision, he didn't hide the fact that he found it very absurd. ""I don't want my nephew to be called what I order at the deli"", he said. Regardless, it is truly perfect to us. We could lovingly tell him/her, ""You're like everything, Bagel."" as a pun that writes itself. We would never have to resort to another joke ever again. 

What do you all think? Hope to hear your thoughts.",1,1758889191.0,NameNerdCirclejerk,0,1.0,False

Apologies, this is a long one. 
So I (25f) met my friend (let’s call her Jenna, 24f) at the end of primary school, and we were very close all through high school and university, even though she moved to another city about 3 hours away. 

Now here’s the thing, Jenna has always had a problem with stretching the truth. Just close enough to the truth to make you either doubt yourself or believe that she must have more information. Making up conflicts between people, exaggerating what and how people have said things, and driving a wedge between friends to position herself as a centre piece of knowledge and innocent of all the ‘drama’. 

It’s also important to note that she has always been very sick, anorexia through high school, endometriosis, had two heart attacks before 24, depressions, anxiety - the works. Looking back, I think we always let her get away with too much but any time we confronted her about her behaviour she would have a meltdown, play the victim and then gaslight us, and no one wanted to send her off the edge. 
I was content letting the friendship fade a little when she moved away so we only caught up a couple of times a year. I had joined a new group of friends at uni, that she also met them when she would come visit. Only after about a year did the people in this group let their masks slip, and it had definitely given me some trust issues. They had initially come across as great and welcoming people (only because one of them wanted to sleep with me and later tried to SA me), very no = yes, stalking is a romantic gesture and I even reported one to the police for suspected grooming of a minor. I could go on more, but overall terrible people. While these behaviours were coming to light, Jenna started dating one of the guys (let’s call him Ryan, 25m) - Que 2 months of long distance crying, increased visits and general misery. Jenna and Ryan broke up, and Jenna immediately started dating one of the other guys in the group (let’s call him Chris, 25m) - like I’m talking next day type switch which was very messy as Ryan and Chris are also on the same soccer team. 

Jenna’s stretching of the truth has gotten significantly worse over the last 3 years or so, with bigger and more dramatic mood swings, to the point I’m worried she might be bipolar. 
A massive breaking point in our relationship as a trip organised by the Uni friends to go away for a weekend. I said no, as I was phasing these toxic people out of my life, but didn’t want the drama of confronting them. I had raised my issues with them directly previously, and they said they would just wait for me to leave social gatherings so they ‘could be themselves’. If that was who they really were, I wanted none of it. Jenna called me asking if I was going on the trip. I said no. She begged me to come, because she was going and didn’t feel safe with the group. I told her not to go but she had already paid. So I went on this trip with her and Chris driving. They dropped me off at the accomodation with the group, announced they had booked separate accomodation and LEFT ME THERE! With the people she didn’t (and I didn’t!) feel safe with. The next day, they were basically uncontactable, didn’t tell me where they were staying, and only picked me up an hour and a half after checkout time with no explanation and she couldn’t understand why I was angry. She even contacted everyone in the group to pay her back the portion of the accomodation she initially covered, which I said no. 

I didn’t talk to her for about 6 months after that, and cut out the last of that toxic group out of my life. 
Jenna then reached out to organise a girls trip to the coast with a couple of people from high school. I didn’t really want to see Jenna, but wanted to catch up people I hadn’t seen for a couple of years, so I agreed to go. It all seemed to be going fine, and I was enjoying catching up with our good mutual friend (let’s call her Marie, 24f). We grabbed groceries and cooked dinner while Jenna made brownies, and things were good. While eating and laughing over dinner I grabbed a brownie and said how good it was. Well. You would have thought I had come up with the worst insult I could have possibly said. Jenna went into a meltdown, screaming in my face that I was a  liar and had pretended to like the pasta at dinner (wtf?). I look bewildered that the other people at the table (they were equally taken aback). Eventually she calmed down but I couldn’t sleep that night, just replaying that in my head and getting angrier. The next morning when I woke up, Jenna and Marie were gone. Not answering calls or texts, but the car was still there. When they eventually came back, I confronted Jenna saying that what she said had upset me, and once again she started screaming, getting all up in my face, saying that I had always looked down on her and then stormed out. I’m not going to lie, I kinda dissociated watching a grown ass woman throwing a tantrum. I was shaking and looked at my other friends (trying their best to be invisible in the room) and asked if I was wrong, and if I was that I would go out and apologise. They said no, and we stayed and talked. Jenna came back about 15 minutes later, obviously annoyed no one came out to comfort her after her tantrum. 

After the trip, Marie and I spent 1.5 hours debriefing the lies we were told and systematically dismantling them - things like telling Marie that I was trying to manipulate her into getting back together with my brother (they dated for 2 months 6 years ago), that I was lying about being straight even claiming she saw me set up my hinge profile as bi (I wish! I know so many great women), and then a plethora of little white lies designed to tear apart our friendship, and make her look better. 

About 2 months after the coast trip, I got a message from her that she and Marie will be in my city and should grab coffee. I text Marie to catch up separately, and Marie let me know Jenna was trying to convince Marie to set up coffee with me and allow Jenna to ‘confront’ me. Marie obviously didn’t do that as she’s not an awful person. 

A couple of weeks later, I got a notification - I was invited to Jenna’s birthday! 24 hours before it started, in another city. I checked and the event was created over a month ago. I politely texted her that I couldn’t go but I hope she had fun. I rechecked the event and I was uninvited. 
About a month ago (a couple months after her birthday) Jenna text that she would be in my city and asked if I would like to catch up for coffee. I said no. She then text that I should visit her in her city, I didn’t respond. Then she asked if I was mad at her, I didn’t respond. The answer is obviously yes, but I just can’t see a world that she doesn’t twist everything I say and play the victim, and honestly? Is she doesn’t understand how she might have made me upset, I don’t think explaining it would make a difference. 
Couple days later, Jenna text ‘I guess that means yes’. 
The next day, I got a text from a random number and all it says is ‘F*#% You’. Now, the timing of this seems way too coincidental, I have her phone number but it might be Chris’ or another friend. 

I decided it was time to be petty. I sent them a link to Lilly Allen’s F*%# You. No response. Every day since I have been trolling this number with songs titled FU, funny t-shirt ads saying it and tik toks where all they say is FU. No response yet, but I cackle a little bit every time I send a new song imagining her on the other side fuming she can’t admit it’s her. Or maybe it’s actually a random person?

I don’t know for certain the number is her, but it still feel cathartic. 

So, am I an AH for ghosting Jenna, and trolling a random number?

1nqzt5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/punemeetup/comments/1nqzt5l/cuddling_buddy/,Cuddling Buddy?,"*So I am already aware about all the judgement that's gonna come with this. So if you don't align with the idea, plzz feel free to not engage with it and move on with your lives.*

Although I have a little hope that this would work. Giving it a shot as to how people really persive this and maybe it would positively affect someone.

We all get lonely, we all need a hug sometimes, we all need the warmth of someone. Due to the presure we all are going though the declining mental health! So why are we soo shy to ask for it? Ask for a hug? Ask for a cuddle? 

We all can agree that cuddling is really comforting but I don't see a cuddling buddy culture here unless you got a partner or a FWB and I know it would be great that way. But we can also just hug and cuddle a random stranger who is far from the troubles of your life.

But anyways back to the point. I m seeking for a cuddle Buddy, maybe we can hangout sometimes or on weekends! Be pals. But can also feel free to hug each other.

When we meet we don't have to directly hug like we were lost in kumb mela or something 😂 let's hit the vibe, check, see if it works, if everything falls into place we can discuss this further! Always open to possibilities of becoming friends.

When I mention cuddling I don't don't mean anything s*xual or explicit just inocent hugging, and cuddling. Nothing wrong, weird or explicit. Nothing out of the line. The idea is foreign but can be tried out with matured people, understanding people, open people, people who match the vibe.

About me: I m a male, straight.
Seeking for opposite gender (females) cause it would be super weird cuddling a guy lol. Let's be realistic. 

Let's just connect, see if we vibe or are comfortable with eachother and if we hit off maybe we can meet someday for coffee? If this sounds like something you are in for.

Dms open! For any questions and suggestions.

With its refreshing scent and eco-friendly promise, it seemed like another addition to my arsenal of cleaning products. However, after using it in different scenarios around the house, I can say it certainly stands out in several unique ways—and not entirely without a few minor quirks.

**Scents That Make Cleaning Enjoyable**

The first thing that struck me was the fragrance. Imagine a crisp, invigorating blend of rosemary and peppermint with a hint of citrusy sweetness from orange, topped with a whisper of clove spice—it feels like walking into a spa while scrubbing your kitchen counters. Since it uses 100% pure essential oil blends rather than synthetic perfumes, the aroma feels natural and not overbearing. I’ve used this cleaner not just in the kitchen but also on my bathroom tiles, and every corner smells divine for hours afterward.

**A Formula That Goes the Extra Mile**

One remarkable aspect is just how concentrated this solution is. Do you know those cleaning products where you pour half a bottle to scrub a single floor? Not this one. A single bottle of this cleaner can make up to 50 gallons of cleaning solution. Whether tackling a coffee spill or giving your floors a thorough mop, it efficiently handles both tasks. I’ve tested it on non-porous surfaces like my sealed hardwood floors, granite countertops, and even my stovetop—and it performs without leaving streaks or residue. One small downside here is that mixing the concentrated cleaner requires some guesswork the first couple of times until you figure out precise portions for your needs. 

**Plant-Based and Biodegradable—Good for the Earth**

Sustainability has become essential to me when shopping for cleaning products, and this one ticks all those boxes. It’s both plant-based and biodegradable, meaning it does its job without leaving a harmful footprint. The USDA-certified biobased label gives me peace of mind every time I rinse it down the sink. I’ve even used it around areas where my kids and pets play regularly, reassured by the absence of harsh chemicals. A big thumb up for a cleaner that’s family-safe and environmentally friendly.

**Ease of Use for a Busy Household**

What really hooks me is its versatility—it’s practically a Swiss Army knife for cleaning products. Whether wiping smudges from our glass dining table, sanitizing sinks post-dinner, or even mopping scuff marks off the entryway tiles, this cleaner works wherever I need it. A single swap-out of cleaning solutions simplified my cabinet filled with various sprays for different chores. That said, the screw-top bottle design felt slightly awkward when measuring small amounts, and a pump dispenser might’ve been a welcome addition.

**Merits**

- The intoxicating rosemary and peppermint fragrance make cleaning a treat.
- Versatile across a range of surfaces, from hardwood to sinks and tiles.
- Concentrated formula delivers maximum value by stretching to prepare up to 50 gallons.
- Plant-based, biodegradable, family-safe, and environmentally conscious.

**Drawbacks**

- Requires careful measuring when diluting; no measuring cap included.
- The screw-top lid feels inconvenient compared to pumps or spray bottles.
- Scent, while gorgeous, might not appeal to someone who prefers unscented cleaning products.

**Competing Brands**

Comparing this to other eco-friendly cleaners like Method or Mrs. Meyer’s, the Sapadilla cleaner feels a tad more luxurious, thanks to its rich essential oil fragrance. While products like Method’s soaps boast sleek packaging and similar biodegradable formulas, their fragrances don’t linger as long. Conversely, Mrs. Meyer’s products are more widely available, but they often cost more for less concentration. That said, Sapadilla’s simplicity and versatility tip its favor over competitors, especially when used on expansive areas like floors, where the concentrated formula truly shines.

**Financial Value**

In terms of value for money, this cleaning solution is a stellar investment for households aiming to reduce clutter and embrace sustainable practices. Sure, it’s a bit more premium than a generic supermarket cleaner, but the long-lasting concentrated formula and multipurpose functionality make it cost-effective in the long run. Plus, the peace of mind from using a chemical-free, biodegradable product is priceless, especially if you care about environmental sustainability and your family’s health.

A Queensland high-roller who deposited and withdrew a staggering $58.7m from two casino accounts over three years has been slugged with a multimillion-dollar tax bill.

He is known as “Lucky Eddie” or “Eddie the Blessed” in poker circles.

The ex-cafe owner claims he got lucky playing high stakes cash poker as a hobby, and he lived solely off his winnings for more than three years, splashing the cash on travel, hotels, and a home and a luxury car bought outright.

But the high-roller gambler who deposited and withdrew a staggering $58.7m from two casino accounts over three years, wasn’t so lucky when a Queensland-based tribunal member probed his finances.

Now he must pay a multimillion-dollar tax bill.

In her decision haded down on July 17, Administrative Review Tribunal of Australia senior member Jane Lye ruled Ti Ke (Eddie) Tran must pay his unpaid income tax for the years 2014 to 2017, mostly from “unexplained deposits” to his bank account.

After the audit, the Commissioner of Taxation (CT) claimed he had taxable income over four years of $9.23m made up of $1.5m in 2014, $1.5m in 2015, $2.9m in 2016 and $3.3m in 2017.

Ms Lye concluded the sources of some cash repayments to Mr Tran’s accounts were “suspicious”.

The 49-year-old also failed to lodge tax returns in 2014, 2015 and 2016, the tribunal heard.

He must also pay hefty fines of more than 75 per cent of his tax bill to the ATO.

Mr Tran failed to prove in the tribunal that the CT’s assessment was excessive.

Ms Lye concluded that the Cambodian refugee failed to establish the source or sources of the money involved in “all his activities” over this time.

He deposited and withdrew $26.6m from accounts at the The Star, and deposited and withdrew $32.1m from accounts at Crown, the ATO told the tribunal, in evidence Ms Lye accepted.

Ms Lye described this as “remarkably high turnover” in Mr Tran’s casino cage accounts, where money and chips can be exchanged.

The ATO told the tribunal that $5.5m in cash deposited or used to buy chips at Crown and The Star “appeared to have no identifiable source”.

“The Tribunal has not been persuaded that Mr Tran has accounted for the sources of all his taxable income,” Ms Lye ruled.

“Mr Tran has not persuaded me on the balance of probabilities that all his activities (including the alleged loans or gifts to family and friends and fellow players) were funded solely from his gambling winnings”.

Ms Lye said some of the sources of Mr Tran’s funds for his gambling and the source of cash deposited into his accounts were “suspicious”, including the purported “repayment” of a loan of $223,700 in chips by Chinese businessman Wan Yong Nguyen.

Nguyen told the tribunal that he borrowed the chips from Mr Tran at Crown Melbourne in 2017 and repaid him a few days later.

The CT argued there were large deposits to Mr Tran’s cage accounts for both The Star in Sydney and Crown Melbourne casinos which were unexplained, and suggested they came from “activities other than gambling”.

But Mr Tran claimed the deposits into his accounts were due to his massive poker wins and repayments of loans he claimed he gave to a large number of people, including fellow gamblers, family and friends.

Mr Tran told the tribunal it was normal for poker players to move large sums of money around, and he assumed that his poker winnings resulted from his ‘hobby’ and were not assessable and so had kept no records.

Mr Tran, who represented himself in the tribunal, took his tax fight to the tribunal after he was audited in 2017 and disputed the massive tax bill.

“Yes, I didn’t lodge tax returns in the early years but I wasn’t earning income in the sense the law intends,” Mr Tran told the tribunal.

“I wasn’t employed and I didn’t believe poker winnings were taxable, and that belief was genuinely held. That’s not fraud. That’s an honest mistake made by someone outside the legal and accounting world,” he submitted to the tribunal.

Mr Tran called famous Aussie world champion poker player Joe Hachem as a witness to give evidence for him, and Ms Lye called Hachem a strong and credible witness.

Mr Tran, who used to run Lonsdale Coffee Delight, told the tribunal he gave his unemployed wife $1.4 million to buy a house in Glen Waverley, Victoria outright on 15 August 2015.

One witness, Nhan Di Pho Vo told the tribunal he owed Mr Tran $811,478.

“I was again concerned that the witness’s evidence was unreliable,” Ms Lye ruled about Mr Vo.

Mr Tran told the tribunal his bankroll for gambling in 2012 would have been close to $1 million, $2.5 million in 2013, $3m to $4m in 2015, $4m to $5m in 2016 and over $5 million in 2017, figures Ms Lye concluded were implausible.

By 2018 Mr Tran was banned from the casinos, he told the tribunal.

Ms Lye was not impressed with Mr Tran’s testimony.

“Mr Tran himself was a difficult and evasive witness. His own evidence about the moneys which passed through his hands lacked corroboration, was inconsistent in many places with the evidence of other witnesses and was changeable.

“There were very few corroborating records to show account for the moneys which passed through his hands and his accounts. In particular, Mr Tran’s estimates of the size of his bankroll, his winnings and his other activities were not plausible, even on his own estimates of his bankroll and winnings.

“He failed to explain deposits into his account from the Family Trust and his estimates of amounts loaned to third parties was often inconsistent with the other party’s evidence. Some of his evidence such as the transfers between his account and his wife’s account were suspicious.

“The Commissioner by his analysis of the casino reports and bank accounts he obtained could only ever hope to estimate Mr Tran’s income,” the decision stat3s.

The original assessment, which includes a 75 per cent penalty, stands

I’m looking for someone to step into the role of the son of the city’s most powerful bank CEO. Your character is rich, sophisticated, well-groomed, and used to moving in high society. You are the kind of man who usually dates girls of the same class, meeting them at glittering parties and carefully arranged set-ups. Your life is polished, calculated, and wrapped up in expectation.

And then, one morning, you walk into my world.

I’ll be playing a working-class girl who’s carved out her own space in the city after a rough start in life. Estranged from my parents, I ran away young and eventually opened a small coffee shop in a struggling part of the city. Despite the brokenness around it, the café has become a beacon of warmth and light — something I built with my own hands and heart. It’s here that our worlds collide.

✨ About My Character ✨
	•	Height: 5’3
	•	Build: Slim but curvy
	•	Appearance: Black hair, tattooed
	•	Personality: Reserved, cautious, and carrying walls from my past. But beneath it all, I’m a hopeless romantic — soft, loyal, and loving once you’ve earned my trust.

🖋️ Writing Style & Expectations
	•	I write in first person and ask that you do the same.
	•	I’m semi-literate and will usually write several paragraphs to keep the story flowing.
	•	I’m looking for someone who enjoys a mix of romance, tension, and emotional depth.

If you’re interested in stepping into the shoes of the CEO’s son — a man who’s never known the simplicity of love until he finds it in a small coffee shop — send me a message. Let’s create something full of longing, slow-burn tension, and maybe even a little bit of fate.

1nqziu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyShine/comments/1nqziu3/reveal_if_mac_retro_matte_lipstick_truly_flatters/,Reveal if MAC Retro Matte Lipstick Truly Flatters All Skin Tones,"Testing out the MAC 773602314782 was as delightful as I'd hoped, especially since it's not every day I try something this iconic. Known for its bold shades and impeccable matte finish, this retro matte lipstick is like the MVP of lipsticks. I’ll admit, being a longtime fan of beauty products, my expectations were soaring, but it didn’t disappoint. This particular shade, ""Flat Out Fabulous,"" is a vibrant pink that somehow manages to feel both classic and modern. Its claim to fame? That soft-retro vibe that works equally well for casual days or special nights.

**Packaging and First Impressions**  
The moment I unboxed it, I was reminded why MAC excels at creating sleek, recognizable packaging. The black-and-silver bullet shape feels premium yet practical. It’s compact enough to carry in my clutch or even fit snugly in tighter pockets of a purse without issue. In fact, I handed it to a coworker who immediately called the design ""quintessential MAC."" Touching the product, the lightweight feel contradicts its durability — definitely a win for being on the go.

**Application and Texture**  
Applying it for the first time was smooth but not too slippery, which I like because there’s control without compromising on glide. The Retro Matte formula has a very dense pigment, and one swipe is surprisingly potent. As someone with average-textured lips, I noticed how velvety it felt without looking overly parched. Throughout the day, I tested it during an office meeting, over coffee, and even mid-snack (hello, croissant crumbs!) and had no smearing. A colleague mentioned how fresh it looked even post-lunch, so points scored there! However, pre-exfoliating your lips or wearing a balm underneath might be wise if you have dry skin, as the formula can cling a little.

**The Shade and Versatility**  
The ""Flat Out Fabulous"" pink is hardcore impressive. It manages to strike an almost universal appeal without being generic. I wore it to a weekend wedding, and my younger cousin immediately asked if she could borrow it for her next event. A quick swipe transitions perfectly between day and nightwear, and because it’s bold without leaning neon, it avoids coming across as juvenile. Whether for a professional office setting or a night out with friends, this lipstick checks both boxes.

[Grab MAC 773602314782 at the best price on Amazon.](https://paulahansen.com/p/b07n77jlfm/)

**Upsides**  
- Long-lasting wear made it almost transfer-proof during meals.  
- Stylish packaging fits easily in both spacious and smaller bags.  
- Vibrant and universally flattering pink.  
- True matte finish that doesn’t require constant blotting.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Might emphasize dryness for those with unprepped lips.  
- Removing it requires a good-quality makeup remover.  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this to some of its well-known competitors, like the Maybelline Matte Ink and NARS Powermatte Lip Pigment, there are clear differences. While MAC shines in pigment payoff and timeless shades, Maybelline offers better budget options. However, NARS holds ground with its lightweight feel, making it better for those sensitive about product weight. What sets this MAC lipstick apart is how it bridges premium quality with all-day dependability, though hardcore drugstore loyalists might still think twice due to price.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Out of all the lipsticks I've tried, this one balances quality and a brand legacy well, though its price might be daunting for individuals who generally go for budget-friendly products. However, for those drawn to products that tick all the key beauty boxes — wearability, pigment depth, and elegance — it’s a worthy splurge. Its ability to multitask between a daytime pop of color and a dramatic nighttime allure is a big plus. While cheaper brands might rival some of the features, the overall experience with this one remains unmatched.

A Girl Has Gone Missin' in the Swamp.,"People think they know strange. Hell, before all this, I thought I did too. You see a lot of shit in the military, even more as a private eye. You think you know people. Well, you don't, trust me. There's a whole layer of filth underneath what you think you know. I thought I'd seen strange. Thought I knew weird. Thought I couldn't be shaken. I was wrong. Findin’ the book changed everythin’ for me. You know that sayin’? If you look into the abyss, the abyss looks back? Well it's true. More true than anythin’. All it takes is a glimpse beneath the veil. I wish I had never taken that last job, but it's too late now. I'm gettin’ ahead of myself. Let me start from the beginnin’.

I work in an old port town in the southern USA. The kind of place with rottin’ docks and always smells like rottin’ fish. The kind of place full of superstitious old-timers nd over the top stories. You won't find us on many current maps. This town hasn't been relevant in a long time. I get most of my work from the nearby city. No, I won't tell you which one. Hell, I won't even tell you the name of this town. Last thing I need is more weirdos comin’ here to go missin’ in the nearby swamps. For the sake of reference though let's call the place Portsmouth, nd you can call me James or Jimmy, local PI. Portsmouth is a rottin’ shell of what it was when I was a kid. Used to be a pretty nice place with lots of work. After the fishin' dried up, nd old mine shut down, it kinda just got forgotten about. Who knew that the mine runoff would send the fish runnin’? Who knew the mine would fall short after a decade of steady output? Not my old man. Not any of the other old-timers either, but that's life I suppose. Now the swamplands creep in on one side of us nd the salt water breaks the other.

So it all started bout two weeks ago. I'd just come down from my upper floor apartment down to my office. I was expectin’ a quiet mornin’ but as I walked to my door to unlock it, I saw a letter layin’ in front of it. I picked it up nd looked at the return address. Ellen Peterson from the city close by. Peterson… I didn't recognize the name. Tearin’ the letter open I looked at the contents. A picture fell out of the folded letter as I opened it up. I picked it up nd saw a young dark haired girl, with bright innocent lookin’ blue eyes nd freckles. I went back to the letter.

Dear Mr. Smith,

I write to you out of desperation. My daughter Mary, who came to Portsmouth to visit her grandfather, has gone missing. I've talked to the sheriff, and all I get is “We are working on it.” It's been three days. I know the time window for her to be alive grows smaller and smaller by the hour. Please accept my case. I'll pay whatever you want. You can start by talking to my father, Elias Bell. Thank you in advance. If you need anything please call me at XXX-XXX-XXXX.

With all hope and sincerity, 

Ellen Peterson

Elias Bell… I knew the old man, nd I knew her too now. Ellen Bell ran off with some rich city boy after high school. I checked my watch. Pretty early. The old men would be at the local diner. I stuffed the letter nd photo in my pocket nd grabbed my coat. I stepped out into the cold, wet, fish smellin’ mornin’ air. Time to work.

I stepped into the diner nd shook off the mornin’ damp as I looked round. As usual the old-timers were all huddled up at the long table in the back. What wasn't usual was the hushed voices instead of the rowdy banter that usually accompanies em. A voice from the counter called out to me.

“Hey Jimmy, here for breakfast?” Said the plump woman behind the bar top.

I looked over nd gave her a small smile, “Not today Eileen. Workin. I'll take a coffee though.” She gave me a small nod nd waddled to the pot, fillin’ up a cup nd handin’ it to me. I took a sip nd headed over to the table. The hushed voices stopped as soon as I neared nd a gruff voice on the opposite side called out.

“Guess you're here to see me, eh boy?” Said a shriveled twig of a man in orange waders.

“Yea Elias, I’m here to see you. Ellen contacted me.” I said quietly lookin’ him in the eye. You had to be respectful with these old-timers. You didn't show respect nd pay your dues to the water nd they wouldn't give you the time of day.

Elias nodded slowly, “She said she would. That useless fuck sheriff hasn’t done a damn thing but sit on his fat ass in that comfy office. I don't know how a beached asshole like him got voted in in the first place.” Said Elias angrily, his fist slammin’ into the table as the other old men nodded at his words.

Sheriff Johnson was a fat old man who basically just filled his position in name only. Most the time if any real work needed to be done in this town it was me or Deputy Bellham doing it. The sheriff never set foot in a boat in his life, therefore he wasn't respected by a single person in this town. Though he might've earned some if he actually did his job. 

“Give me the details Elias. Tell me what happened to Mary.” I said, leanin’ on the end of the heavy wooden table.

Elias looked down into his coffee cup. The other old men just watchin’ him patiently as he seemed to gather his recollection. 

“She's been stayin’ with me bout three weeks. Honestly I was surprised she wanted to come out. Ain't nothin in this town for a girl her age. Maybe it's because I dote on her, or she just wanted to get away from her folks, I don't know."" 

He shook his head slowly for a moment before continuin', “Bout five days ago she said she made a friend. I asked her who, but she brushed me off. She was a good girl, so I didn't push the subject. Next day she went out again, came back nd there was a smell hangin’ on her. I knew it, we all do. That swamp smell. I asked her again, who was this friend? Again she tried to brush me off, but I pushed this time. Asked her if it was one of those swamp-dwellers. She hesitated nd that was confirmation enough for me. Maybe I got a bit stern with her. Told her she knows better. Shouldn't be hangin’ round those swamp folk.” 

He paused for a second nd a single tear rolled down his cragged cheek. “Guess she just wanted to placate me, cuz she said ok, nd she wouldn't see em again. I thought that was the end of it. Went out to sea the next mornin’. When I came back she was gone.” 

An old-timer next to him placed a weathered hand on his shoulder as Elias seemed to sink in on himself. I nodded slowly. Last thing I wanted to do was take a trip to the swamplands, but if that's where the trail led, then that's where I was goin’. 

“Alright Elias, I'll look into it, but you know, three days in the swamp.. You know what I'll probably find right?” I said grimly.

Elias looked me in the eye sternly. “You just bring her back boy. One way or the other nd you'll have our gratitude.” The old-timers all gruffed out their assents.

“Alright.” I said standin’ up, ""I'll contact you when I find somethin’.” With that I downed my coffee nd headed out, puttin’ my mug on the bar.

“Be careful out there Jimmy.” Said Eileen with a worried wrinkle in her brow.

I nodded to her as I walked past nd headed back out into the damp mornin’.

As I walked down the pothole covered road I thought about what to do next. I'd need to prepare. No way I was goin’ into the deep swamp unarmed nd I'd need a guide. There was only one person for that. I took a turn nd headed to the bar nearby. Probably the only place in this town open twenty-four seven.

I pushed open the heavy door nd was greeted by the smell of warm booze nd sawdust. Here nd there the local drunks snoozed or talked to themselves in their seats. The lumberjack of a bartender greeted me as I entered.

“Mornin' Jimmy, what can I get ya?” He said in his low cannon of a voice.

“Nothin’ today, Al. Workin'."" He nodded nd looked to the lean figure sittin’ at the bar. Henry looked like a cowboy tryin' to become an alligator. Wearin’ blue jeans with alligator boots, vest nd hat. He sat there sippin’ on his whiskey. He was a muscular, tanned man in a small lean kind of way. A large bowie knife was strapped to his hip like a promise.

I came over nd sat next to him. didn't say a word, didn't have to. In all likelihood he already knew why I was here. He side-eyed me for a moment nd downed the rest of his glass.

“When we leavin’ Jimmy?” He said in his smooth voice.

“Soon as you can get ready Henry.” I stared at him for a moment as he put his glass on the table nd pushed it away.

“Give me bout an hour nd I'll have the boat ready.” He stood up nd looked at me. “Dwellers been real strange lately, Jimmy. Strap heavy for this one. Not sure how they gunna’ react anymore.” I nodded thoughtfully as he stepped out.

Sighin', I got up off the stool nd headed out myself. I walked to my office stoppin’ momentarily to look out on the water. The dark blue water splashed against the decrepit docks. A few boats that have seen better days floated by the parts that were still usable. I remembered the days helpin’ my dad load the boat before goin’ out. Everythin’ seemed brighter back then. I wondered then if this town would survive my lifetime. I turned away nd stepped into my office.

I went through my apartment grabbin’ my gear. Camo boots, waders nd jacket. My .38 for the inside pocket. My .44 on the side of my hip. I debated on rifle or shotgun. In the end I went with the shotgun. I filled my pockets with ammo. When it came to the swamp nd the dwellers it was best to be prepared for anythin’. Was a time when the dwellers nd us got along alright. These days though they were almost completely isolated nd didn't appreciate visitors. If Henry said they were even stranger now.. Then I wasn't really sure what to expect anymore. I grabbed a backpack with some extra gear. Rope, tape, tarp, whatever might be useful if we got in trouble or had to bring back Mary in the worst case scenario. 

I stepped onto the docks, the weight of my gear remindin' me of my time in the army. Henry sat in his flat bottomed boat. Rifle slung over his shoulder nd pistol strapped to the hip where his knife wasn't. I tossed my bag in nd climbed inside. Henry lit a cigarette before startin’ up the motor. He took a drag nd started movin’ away from the dock. 

We headed up the coast. When we reached the channel that would lead us to the swamplands I looked up from inspectin’ my weapons.

“So how bad is it now, Henry?” I said watchin’ him expertly guide the boat.

Blowin’ out a puff of smoke, Henry looked back at me. “Pretty bad Jimmy. They're more paranoid than ever. More dangerous. Last month I came out to check my traps. Caught one comin’ up behind me, knife out. Fucker was covered in swamp mud, practically naked cept some cloth round his junk. Felt like I was seein’ tribesfolk in the Amazon or somethin’. Couldn’t understand a word the fuck said either before I made him silent.”

I looked at Henry for a long moment. There's an unspoken rule out here. What happens in the swamp stays in the swamp. It rarely happens but this town sometimes takes justice into its own hands. When they do.. They take it to the swamp. I decided I didn't wanna ask anymore questions nd went back to my inspections.

As we headed further inland the tree growth grew thicker, nd the canopy above blocked out the sun. Henry wove us between the trees nd kept us away from too shallow waters. We were movin’ slow. As I looked round I didn't really notice much of anythin’. Then I noticed that I really didn't notice anythin’. No movement. No birds makin’ noise overhead. No movement under the water's surface. Even the flies nd mosquitos were awol.

“Henry what the hell is goin’ on out here?” I asked in a whisper. I'm not sure why, but I had a feelin’ I needed to stay quiet. Had a feelin’ there were eyes on us. Henry just looked back at me. His expression was like stone as he turned back to guide us through. I readied my shotgun nd crouched into a stable position scannin' the area. I couldn't see anythin’, but I knew they were there. My instincts screamed danger as we moved ever deeper into the dark swamp.

Suddenly below us there was a boom. Before I could react the boat flipped up into the air, water splashin’ up round us before I was sinkin’ down in it. The filthy swamp swallowed me. Its foul taste fillin’ my mouth as I struggled to regain my senses. I flipped nd turned, losin’ all sense of direction. Blindly I swam where I thought the surface was, instead I met mud nd roots. Turnin’ I swam the opposite direction. I finally breached the surface inhalin’ the stale air, quickly lookin’ round for Henry. There was land nearby nd on the edge I saw him. Muddy hands dragged him from the water nd held him to the ground. I looked at the savage muddy faces. I couldn't believe these were the same dwellers. They had become absolutely feral, lookin’ like tribesfolk of some kind. As I looked, a figure stepped from the shadows, a woman bare chested nd covered in mud, wearin’ some kind of tribal headdress. 

She knelt down beside Henry as she pulled out the jagged, wicked lookin' dagger, nd he began to fight even harder against his captors. The woman raised the dagger high above her head shoutin’ in some language I'd never heard before, nd then, she looked at me. Bright green eyes looked at me. Too bright. Too green, or not quite green. Pain started to rip through my head as we stared into each other's eyes, but then she turned away, nd plunged the dagger down into Henry's heart. He gasped loudly as the blade struck home, his body twitchin before fallin’ still.

The dwellers stood then, all turnin’ towards me. Green eyes, but not quite green. Slowly they stepped back into the shadows, disappearin’ from view, but I knew they were still there, watchin’ me as I carefully made my way to the muddy earth where Henry lay. I struggled up the muddy banks to Henry's body, catchin’ my breath nd lookin’ down at him. He was gone. His eyes wide in terror nd slack jawed. Lookin’ round me, the shadows of the swamp seemed to deepen. My head felt tight, like somethin’ was pushin’ it from either side. Images of my time in the desert flashed in my head, but they were different, monochrome in color. Grey sands, black rocks nd dark sky, but there was a light somewhere, a greenish light. 

I shook my head nd reached for my weapons. The shotgun was gone nd so was the .38, but my .44 was still strapped to my hip. I pulled it out breathin’ slow, tryin' to calm myself. I scanned the area, but the light of the day was fadin’ fast nd the dark shadows lengthenin’. I took inventory of my ammo, eighteen bullets includin’ what was already loaded. I reached to Henry's side nd grabbed his knife. Then I moved.

The sun began to dip lower as I walked through the stinkin’ mud. I estimated my direction, tryin’ to move south towards the coast. The swamp grew darker nd darker as I stumbled forward. My flashlight was in my pack, lost somewhere in the swamps murky water. So I kept goin’, stayin’ quiet nd watchin’ my surroundin’s. Now nd then I’d see some movement, but it'd be gone as soon as I turned to look. My head seemed pounded harder the further I went. Eventually the sun vanished, plungin’ me into darkness. Through the canopy above I could see some stars, but I couldn't figure em out. Twinklin’ mockeries of our own constellations, but different enough that I couldn't figure out my directions. So I kept on, hopin’ I was movin’ straight, but knowin’ I probably wasn't. 

“James..” A whisper came from my right. I turned, holdin’ my gun forward in front of me. I couldn't see anythin’ but the shadows. They seemed to blur in my vision nd I quickly rubbed my eyes to try nd clear em.

“Come James..” Another from behind me. I spun, wavin’ my revolver side to side, scannin’ the area in front of me. Again nothin’ but blurred, twistin’ shadows.

I started to run. I moved awkward nd slow, the mud suckin’ at my boots with each step. The whispers came again all round me.

“James.. Come James.. Chosen James..” The cacophony of whisperin’ voices. My head pounded. My disorientation buildin’ nd buildin’ till finally I collapsed into the slick mud. 

Then there was light. Green flames lightin' up on torches all round me, held aloft by mud covered, green-eyed dwellers. I sat up raisin’ my gun once again. 

“Stay back!” I screamed as I waved my gun between the dozen or so individuals surroundin’ me. Then I noticed it. As I moved my weapon in front of me, two more torches lit up revealin’ a stone table covered in mold nd a rust colored substance. Round it were corpses, corpses mummified in a wet, sticky way that only a swamp can produce. Two of em were kneelin’ before the stone table, nd held aloft in their hands was a large leather bound book.

The figures of the dwellers stood in place round me. I stood up, gun still raised nd lookin’ at each of em. Then I felt a pull. Somethin’ in my mind tellin’ me to look forward again. I turned back, my eyes fallin’ on the strange book held up in those skeletal hands. Strange words were etched into the leather. 

Liber Smaragdi Luminis Aeterni

A shadow behind the altar seemed to shimmer nd a figure came forward. The woman from before, her green eyes lockin’ on my own as she approached the table. She raised her hands high up into the air.

“Electus Regis Smaragdi Venit! Gaudeamus in eius lapsu ad insaniam!” She yelled over us, her voice manic nd eyes fevered as she looked round.

I looked closer at her mud covered face as she looked at me from behind the altar. A wide grin spread across her face. Then recognition hit me.

“Mary? Mary, your mother sent me! I'm here to help you get home!” I yelled at her. 

She kept starin’ at me. “Domum sum… in lumine ipsius” She whispered at me.

Suddenly pain ripped through my skull nd I dropped to my knees, my vision blurrin'. I looked up to see hollow sockets nd wide toothy grins meet my gaze. An emerald light began to emanate from their dark eyes as skeletal hands grabbed nd held me down. I struggled with all my might as all round me the flames grew brighter as mud covered figures burst into eldritch flame.

I heard Mary's voice rise up, “Recipe nos, Rex Nativus ex Vacuao!” Another bright green flame grew from the direction of the table. Suddenly two green lights filled my vision. My eyes burned nd my head throbbed nd then, everythin’ went dark.

I opened my eyes to that monochrome landscape. Grey sand nd black rock with a toilin’ black sky high above me, but as before there was a light. A light like liquid emerald floatin’ nd reflectin’ off the monochrome surfaces round me. I turned in its direction to see a tall black misshapen tower of inconceivable geometry. At its top was the source of the light. A figure was there, behind its head a halo of that alien light. My mouth gaped open as I dropped to my knees. It was so close, yet so far away, nd to my horror I wanted to be closer. 

Shadowy tendrils slowly slipped down from the roilin’ sky round the figure. It reached a long clawed hand towards me as if beckonin’ me to take it. I reached out to it, nd suddenly I was there, kneelin’ before the loomin’ figure now only a few feet away from me. It turned its faceless head towards me nd reached down. Its large hand pressin’ to my chest. Pain flared from its touch burnin’ me nd forcin’ out a scream I didn't even realize I could emit from my body.

Its voice ripped through my skull, tearin’ my mind apart with each word. “Awaken child and see truth around you.” 

Then darkness took me once again.

I awoke a week later in a hospital bed. Sittin’ in a chair near me was Elias’s bony form. Images of hollow eyes nd skeletal grins flashed through my mind nd I yelped closin’ my eyes nd pressin’ my palms into em.

“Jimmy.. Boy what happened to you out there?” Elias said quietly. I kept my eyes shut.

“Don’t let anyone in the swamp Elias… nobody can go in there!” I practically screamed at him. 

He stepped back warily. “Yeah, okay boy. I'll tell everyone to stay out. Jimmy.. What happened to Mary? To Henry?” He asked hesitantly.

I opened my eyes then nd looked at Elias with a manic expression. “They’re gone Elias! Gone! There's nothin’ left!” I shouted loudly. Elias ran to the door best he could, yellin’ for a doctor to come.

I spent about a month in that hospital. I've forgotten things. I know I have. Everythin’ here is what I can remember. At least I think it is. Honestly I don't know what is completely real about this story anymore. What I do know is that I see things slippin’ into the shadows from the corners of my eye. I know that I have a certain instinct about things now. I know that when I got home the large leather-bound book was sittin’ on my bed. I know the handprint-like scar on my chest shimmers green in a certain light. I know that when I look in the mirror.. I see emerald eyes starin’ back at me.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1nqzgds,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalmedium/comments/1nqzgds/cold_except_in_the_evenings_cold_after_healing/,Cold except in the evenings / Cold after healing foods,"Hey MM Fam,

Let me give a little bit more context. It does not matter whether I am focusing MM diet or any other Form of eating - I am usually cold / low blood pressure / slow metabolism until after diner. My lunch and diner usually Contain fat but not always. 

My mornings are always 
16oz LW 
12-16oz CJ (80% of my days)
HMDS smoothie or fruit 
1 cup of coffee
Lunch 
Diner 

My days are usually sedentary (IT home office job), I am doing 3-5 workouts per week and sometimes go for a Walk. But I average at around 2k steps per Day.

When I have a huge bowl of freshly Steamed potatoes and lettuce I actually feel COLD afterwards (except it is in the evening)

What I can notice EVERY EVENING: 
I become calmer, my handy and feet get warm and dry Instead of cold sweat. My breaths are deeper and my body feels cozy. So in my simple understanding...the parasymoathic nervous system comes online and it feels like it is the first time at the day. 

So here are some random thoughts which I think might have to do with how I am feeling 

- thyroid?
- something Stresses me through out the first part of the day?
- evening is the time were I am with my wife on the Couch and I immediately calm down 
- my day is mostly sitting, mostly screens and in my lunch break I play video games and go back to work at my Laptop afterwards 

It would be great to hear some thoughts or experiences on this ❤️",2,1758888048.0,medicalmedium,1,1.0,False

*Sylvara woke up four hours later, which was normal for a woman her age. J almost looked dead as he slept uninterrupted. Sylvara checked his heartbeat and breathing to make sure her love was actually still alive.*

*When an elf sleeps, they appear peaceful, everything relaxed as they lie down and close their eyes, resembling an artful, unmoving statue. Humans, though, look as if they have flopped over and died, with the occasional kick or roll that proved life.*

*Bourdom, like all nobles, quickly took over Sylvara’s thoughts. She decided to test the light produced by her new dagger and read the ranger’s journal. Part of her wanted to explore the contents of his pack as she pulled out the worn book. The kidney bag attached to the strap of his quiver seemed small for how much it actually contained.*

*Sylvara drew her small dwarf dagger, whose blade resembled a garden spade. The reddish candlelight it emitted illuminated the pages with a blue hue. Well, blue to humans, but elves can see into the ultraviolet light spectrum, so I have no idea what Sylvara actually saw. It’s super hard to describe the colours perceived by someone who sees with five primary colours instead of just three like us humans. So let’s move on from that topic and say it was red-blue, but not purple, and definitely not both red and blue at the same time. And dear reader, by the All-Mother, I will never try to describe such a topic again.*

*Anyway, let's run far away from that and get back to it. Sylvara turned through the pages until she found something she could actually read. His handwriting looked poor in common Bitu script, but his runes appeared artful and hummed with power. Too bad she had no idea what the northern runes meant.*

*The journal was not organized in any traditional methods, it was more like scattered thoughts jotted down as they came to his mind. The ranger wrote about what animals told him, such as which berries and leaves could be eaten, which water was safe and why.*

*He described ways to see the stars as a guide home or to the grand cities in the west. Then there was a list of gods, with zero or five stars next to them, along with odd comments about who owed or owned whom.*

*Sylvara's face lit up with fascination as she studied the peculiar star-rating system, her body curled comfortably beneath the rough inn blankets. The dwarf dagger in her hand cast its hard-to-transcribe light over the pages, while silver hair cascaded over her bare shoulders as she tilted the journal toward her small magical light.*

*""Five stars for the All-Mother, zero for the Emerald Lord?"" she whispered with amusement. ""How did he even meet so many gods?"" Her ears perked up with each curious breath as she continued reading.*

*Her curves shifted against the ruined straw mattress as she turned another page, tracing his crude sketches of demonic creatures he had dissected and used for their parts. She pondered why they couldn't be cooked or eaten. He listed his mistakes alongside his successes, an idea that would put bile in the throats of elven men.*

*""Such honesty,"" Sylvara murmured, emerald eyes softening as she gazed at her sleeping ranger. ""I've never known honesty like yours."" She poked him just to check if he was sleeping and not dead or dying. He mumbled something, so the Queen was sure he was alive..*

*She placed a gentle kiss on his stubbled cheek before returning to his unexpectedly captivating journal. There was a hand-drawn diagram of monsters, explaining how to eat them, skin them, and use their parts. It seemed to contain more successful notes and details than his attempts with demons, along with answers to the mystery meat (something called a kelpy).*

*Small notes on the side detailed discoveries he had made, such as ""The feathers of the boobbrie are coated in an oil that, when heated over a fire, can be used to waterproof wool while you eat the fine gamey fish-like meat"" ""Mimics, unlike more common slimes, are totally inedible, but if dried out and cut into small pieces to be placed in a jar of pickling solution, you can produce a potent heat-activated glue that mixes with most lead paints"" and ""Dragon tail steak is best cooked until well done.""*

*“How and when did he eat dragon meat?” she wondered. It then occurred to her that the leather of his gaiters and vambracers didn’t look like cow, rabibuck, or even goat hide.*

*Next, she came across a charcoal rubbing of what looked like a tombstone: ""The Bastard Lord J, the Hero, 1123-1183."" The rest was in northern runes and left a mystery to the elf reading.* 

*Queen Sylvara's eyes misted slightly as she traced the dates with her slender finger. She could feel herself tensing beneath the bedding as she calculated the brief human lifespan, merely sixty years against her fifteen centuries.*

*""So fleeting,"" she sighed deeply as she continued leafing through the journal.* 

*She almost giggled when a pressed flower fell into her lap as she turned a page, a purple iris. The ranger must have picked it near Emmolon before the guards took him to her.* 

*He wrote about her in the journal, using words that framed her as if she were a timeless goddess.* 

*Her mood quickly shifted as she discovered a crude sketch of herself from their first meeting, surprisingly detailed despite his apparent lack of artistic training. Her slitted eyes hovered over the runes scrawled beneath ancient northern words she couldn't decipher. (Qᚢᛖᛖᚾ Syᛚvᚨᚱᚨ, A' ᛒᚺòᛁᛞᚺᛖᚨcᚺ)* 

*“If the ranger is lucky, he could die at 80 years old, while the average high elf lives a maximum of 20,000 years.” Thoughts flitted through her mind like a busy trading post, each one more unpleasant than the last. “What about half-elves? How do they age? Do they mature slowly, only hitting puberty at 50 and adulthood at 100? Or could a half-elf become a full-grown adult in just 20 short years?”*

*“How do humans become as skilled as some elves? A human knight might be 30, but an elven knight who is already 300, could be equally skilled, or the human could still kill the elf.”*

*“The tall man, her ranger, poor J, has already died five times! Does he have a plan for the next one?” That thought brought unshed tears to her eyes as she contemplated their vastly different lifespans. She curled protectively around him, her silver hair draping across his chest, while she set aside her journal.*

*“Twenty thousand years is my birthright,” she whispered, pain lacing her words. As she nestled closer, she traced his weathered features with soft, gentle hands, lingering on the battle scars that told his stories. “Yet I would trade millennia for mere decades by your side,” Sylvara murmured, drinking in his mortal beauty. “If we have a child, it won't be a full elf, but they will carry your wild spirit.” She kissed his forehead, feeling the magic tingling at her touch as ancient maternal instincts stirred within her.*

*As the sun rose over the village, its golden light streamed through the window, and her eyes quickly adjusted. She slipped on J’s tunic over her naked form, wanting to surprise her lover with drinks and breakfast downstairs. However, she had no clue how the ranger took his coffee, she hadn’t had any since the morning he arrived at the palace, and really, truly wished she had packed some.*

*Her hand had just made contact with the doorknob, suddenly there came a tapping.*

*As of someone gently rapping, rapping at the chamber window.*

*“Tis Edgar—tapping at my chamber window—only this and nothing more.”* 

*Edgar sat in the window, singing an awful tune that sounded familiar, tapping at the window like a chamber door. She let the poor bird in. “Good morning, Edgar,” she greeted the raven, a smile curving her lips as she stroked his dark, clean feathers. Noticing the blood staining his talons, she pondered where he had gone last night and decided instead to head downstairs to fetch breakfast for herself and J.*

*She swayed gracefully, her slender fingers combing through her hair in a futile attempt to look presentable. “I wonder what northern beasts eat for breakfast,” Sylvara mused, casting a glance back at the door of the room her ranger still slept in. “A thousand years of motherhood, yet I’ve never fetched breakfast for anyone before.” It was a strange thought, she had never considered such things before.*

*Quietly, she slipped down the corridor, her bare feet padding soundlessly against the carved wooden floor, feeling the floral patterns with her tiptoes. She did her best by asking a northern girl working there, but the girl only pointed at a number on the menu. The answer was both cheap and simple—most things in the north were.*

*The smell alone would have awakened J if Edgar hadn’t already done so.* 

*The queen walked in on them arguing. Unsure of what it was about, she set herself and the tatty wooden tray down at the table.*

*“For the last fuckig time, Im’a nut taking ya to fight t dread beast oof the bog! I’ve git three quests to do already, so yoo can dew’it!” J yelled at the bird.*

*Edgar squawked.*

*“Oh shit, really?” J replied.*

*Edgar squawked again.*

*“Easy does, we can do it on the way to the palace,” J seemed to agree with something, at least, concerning Edgar.*

*The queen was lost in the exchange but offered the boys breakfast.* 

*“Wonderful, my love! By the way, I need to kill a cat later,” J said, apparently concluding that line of avian conversation. A bowl of goat milk porridge mixed with seeds and honey (a dish cooked in the northern way, all tossed in a pot and boiled until someone had the bravery to call it food when others could mistake it for some industrial paste), it was waiting for him at the table.* 

*He happily ate it while the queen picked at her bowl of poached fruit. She was disappointed by the selection, but this still wasn’t the palace. Soon, she would have access to rich, sweet, and exotic fruits again, like lemons.*

*Edgar stole some choice berries from her meal, but she didn’t stop him.*

*The tall man’s green eyes glanced over the clay mug as his lady passed it to him. It was too hot to hold anywhere but the handle. “What’s this brownish warm stuff?” J asked, holding the strange blackish drink. It smelled nutty and earthy. “I’ve never seen anything like it before. Is it soup?” The question had an unusual impact, resonating in such a way that it could be heard in the next universe by one Dan Seibert, who made the unfortunate decision to bring it up with his wife, triggering a long line of donnenoes that would years later smack the ranger in the face.*

*Edgar sang.*

*“Why is he laughing at me?”*

*Sylvara’s emerald eyes danced with amusement, almost causing her to push off the breakfast tray. “It’s coffee, my northern beast,” she explained.*

*Slender fingers guiding the cup back toward him. ""A beverage prized in my royal courts, bitter at first taste but addictive thereafter,"" Sylvara added, jewelled eyes watching his reaction curiously. ""Much like falling for an elf queen, I imagine.""*

*J chuckled, Sylvara found it adorable how he didn't know he was blushing, the Ranger picked up the mug again, his eyes widened as the exotic drink touched his tongue, ""This is the best fucking thing I've ever drank in my whole daim mortal life on Bitu!"" he kept drinking the whole boiling mug like a poor man does beer. ""fuck I'm awake now, remind me to fill a water skin with that stuff."" a horrible idea, an idea so bad it hurts to translate and write down in the king's English.*

*The queen thought of the coffee as weak, bland and nothing like what she had at the palace, but J made her appreciate it.*

*“Reminds me of dandy lion root drinks, but so much better,” he remarked.*

*After their unusual breakfast, the ranger said something strange: ""So, before we went at it like rabbits last night, you mentioned wanting to help that slave girl?""*

*“What was your plan or idea? I’ve got three,” he added.*

*“Squawk!” quoth the raven.*

*“Edgar has a horrible idea, so we actually have four,”*

*Sylvara leaned forward in her chair, intrigued. “I had thought perhaps we could look into purchasing her freedom,” she replied in her royal tone, her slender fingers tracing the rim of her coffee cup. “Though I confess, liberation without purpose may leave her vulnerable,” she added. “What are your three ideas, my northern beast? And dare I ask what mischief Edgar proposes?” She cast a suspicious glance at the berry-thieving raven, aware from her diplomatic experience that bird-brained schemes rarely ended well.*

*J stood up from his creaking wooden chair and began pacing the room towards the window. ""Well, Edgar said we should kill everyone but the girl."" Edgar nodded enthusiastically as J prepared his pipe. ""And my first idea is… to just kill her owner and run off with her over our shoulders… like we do in the North,"" he said, stretching the words as magic lit his pipeweed.*

*""The second idea… is the same as yours, we buy her… But that just adds to the trade, really,"" J sighed as smoke poured from his mouth. ""Lastly, number three.. no, four is you put on your crown… get yourself looking like a queen again, and tell them all off."" He looked at Sylvara, seeming open to comment. ""But that does mean giving up your disguise and letting people know who you are, Sylvara?""* 

*She wasn't sure if it was rude to point a pipe at people in the North, but he did so anyway before returning to puffing smoke.*

*Sylvara narrowed her eyes thoughtfully, leaning back against the wooden chair as she tapped her slender fingers against the table. ""Well, diplomatic negotiation rules surely apply here, my northern beast,"" she said, taking a deep breath that made her chest rise beneath the borrowed tunic. The thought of revealing her identity made her shift uncomfortably.*

*“I believe we must attempt to purchase her first,” Sylvara decided. ""Should that fail, I shall reveal myself as Queen—though not before ensuring we have escape routes planned. Edgar's solution must remain our last resort.""*

*She smiled wryly at the raven. ""Though I confess, his directness has a certain appeal after centuries of courtly subterfuge."" Her ring that detected lies ran cold.*

*J leaned over to Edgar and whispered, “What’s subterfuge?” he asked the bird, smoke still on his breath as he got dressed.*

*Edgar sang a few notes that almost sounded like a giggle.* 

*“Subterfuge means deception or trickery,"" Sylvara explained, biting back a smile as she reluctantly returned the tunic and gathered her belongings for a new day.*

*“So it’s subterfuge if I cast the spell pocket sand, or pull out my hidden poisoned blade as I run away from the guards..."" His eyes widened. ""Pretend I never said that last part.”*

*J redirected as he finished packing his things, possibly sneaking a few of the tavern's items while Sylvara wasn't looking. ""I'll cut a string of my demon money. I've got like three copper coins, but that’s Eastern money,"" he said, holding a set of strings with a lot of demon rings on them from his coin pouch. ""I think I have at least 123 gold, 56 silver, and three copper pieces altogether.""*

*Some doubt filled his face. “I don’t think it’ll be enough, but you’ve got coin, right queen?” he asked openly and bluntly.*

*The fact that he had not called her queen in a while sent a rush of thoughts through her mind.*

*“Squawk!” Edgar coughed up three gold pieces, which looked like the kind printed in the far southern countries, featuring a rat king on one side and a hippo on the other.*

*Sylvara's eyes widened at the bizarre sight, stiffening with surprise. Her hair swayed as she tilted her head at the peculiar raven. She swayed as she moved about the room, slender fingers counting out several ornate gold pieces from her hidden compartment in her sceptre.*

*""A queen never travels without resources,"" Sylvara remarked, emerald eyes glinting. ""Though I'm most curious how your feathered companion acquired his treasure.""*

*“Edgar is a holy knight rember?” J reminded her.*

*Squawks of agreement from the bird.*

*""It pays well"", added J as they walked downstairs to face the innkeeper. ""So buy first, show you are queen if that doesn't work""*

*“Squawk”*

*""kill if they don't belive you are the queen?"" he went quite as the breakfast drinkers.*

*The elf queen surveyed the innkeeper with a regal assessment, her voluptuous form commanding attention despite her current attire. Silver hair flowed effortlessly down her back as she stepped forward with queenly bearing.*

*""Good morning, innkeeper,"" she addressed him in the elf language, her black-painted lips curving into practised diplomacy that J had first taken as a smile. Her hands fumbled slightly as she produced gold coins, somewhat undermining the image she had built.* 

*Her plump posterior swayed subtly as she shifted her weight, slender fingers arranging the mixed currencies on the counter.*

*""I understand you house a young serving girl who is not freely employed,"" Sylvara stated, her emerald eyes hardening slightly. ""We wish to discuss her purchase and immediate manumission.""*

*She felt J's presence behind her, solid and reassuring. Her northern beast has surprising principles. Well, surprisingly to her, really one of his few atypical behaviours was his desire for all sentient life to have equal rights.*

*""Name your price,"" she added, her voice dropping to a dangerous octave. ""And do consider it carefully.""*

*""Eye work for 4, pretty lady,"" J attempted to explain in the elf language. His failure may have been a blessing in disguise, after all, dimwitted muscle can be more intimidating than any well-spoken henchmen, only one could be talked out of feeding the tooth fairies at the park your pearly whites.*

*The innkeeper spoke with the twisted accent of the eastern borders, his R's, L's, W's, and Y's blending together in a way that rendered them indistinct if you weren't paying close attention. ""I'll ask for 500 gold pieces, but you don't get her clothes with the deal."" His tone was loud and brash.*

*The innkeeper's voice reminded J of how many elves who weren't named Sylvara spoke ""Tall men make horrible workers or servants anyway. Barely talk any Elvish, and the girl can't read anything on top of that,"" he said with what felt like a spit at the ranger.*

*The price seemed fair, perhaps? Sylvara and J didn’t really know the market rates for slaves. It’s not like they had ever done anything like this before. Then again, it was also not something anyone should ever have to endure doing. However, the idea that people were not objects remained a controversial thought in Mythralis.*

*Sylvara's soulful eyes flashed with indignation at the insult to her companion's people, body tensing beneath the mismatched armour. Her silver hair seemed to shimmer with a magical energy as she straightened to her full height, looking down at the innkeeper. A subtle charm spell laced her words.*

*""Five hundred is unacceptable. Not without clothes and a collar. Three hundred fifty is quite acceptable though, innkeeper,"" she replied in perfect Elvish that rang with a dangerous undertone. Her full breasts rose with controlled breaths as she continued, ""But your disrespect is not.""*

*Her plump posterior shifted as she leaned forward, her slender fingers counting out gold with practised precision.*

*""This 'tall-man' is my chosen companion, lover, and protector,"" Sylvara stated coldly, emerald eyes boring into the Innkeeper's with an intensity that made a drill feel jealous. ""And he understands far more than you realize.""*

*The innkeeper glanced at Sylvara’s…curvaceous form and the Ranger’s sturdy physique. “I will go get her,"" his greyish hand scooped the money off the counter and into a waiting, hungry belt pocket. ""But you better not be seen here again.""*

*“Squawk,” Edgar felt compelled to say before leaving a white stain on the countertop.*

*At least 350 gold was better than 500. The innkeeper kept the clothes and slave collar, leaving the girl nude as he rushed the strange quartet out the door and into the cold street.*

*They left well-rested, well-fed, and caffeinated on the upside.*

*The lady tall-man, who gave no protest to being passed to her new “...owners…” may have expected her hopeful rescue to have gone differently. None of it went like it would have in an old saga or bardic retelling. The last orders she received from her previous master were not unheard but sadly fitting, “Get naked” again.*

*The iron collar left an imprint around her neck. It had clearly been there for a long time, a cruel art of sorts that elf slavers had absolutely mastered, not too tight to cut off circulation, but certainly pinching enough to be a constant reminder of her situation. The cold air finally had a chance to touch her neck, which was three or maybe five shades lighter than the rest of her exposed pale skin. Well, the skin that was meant to be exposed, anyway.*

*The ranger put his cloak around the naked girl, who couldn’t have been older than J but was assuredly in her twenties at the oldest. ""Let's go shopping,"" he said after they distanced themselves from the aged oak inn.*

*It would also be nice to find clothing that actually fit Sylvara, her curves were straining the seams of her current tunic, and her armour would sit on her body much better if her outfit did. The last thing the Ranger wanted was for her to get hurt.* 

*""What is your name?"" the ranger asked. ""Can you speak? Or did they...?""*

*She opened her mouth, revealing the vacant space where a sensible person would expect to find a tongue. A common practice among elf slavers.*

*""Oh, those don’t grow back. Only magic could fix that if we had the missing piece...” he said with a long sigh. “Tᚺᚨ ᛗᛁ cᚺᛟ ᛞᚢᛁᛚᛁcᚺ,” he uttered.*

*“SQUAWK,” Edgar added as he sat on her head like a hat.*

*The queen had no idea what had been said, but the girl looked as if she understood with a nod.*

*The northman took the hand of his woman, who held the girl’s hand, and off the trio went with Edgar following closely behind to just barely hang onto the term of quartet.*

*Sylvara felt a surge of compassion for the young woman.*

*The question lingered in the air awhile. It needed to age and breathe a little before anyone could really react to it.*

*It was one of those questions that linger in your mind, the ones you can’t answer but can’t leave unanswered either. They collectively decided to clothe her before discussing it further, motivated perhaps by a sense of guilt about their ownership of her.*

*They found a local dressmaker, the sign marked by the Weavers’ Guild, finally someone who had to serve them, no more getting ripped off or kicked out. “It’s so strange that this is the only guild store around here right Sylvara?” the ranger remarked.*

*“What do you mean, my northern beast?” the lady elf asked, noticing the confusion on the ex-slave girl’s face. To then realise it was aimed at her, not him.*

*“The trade guilds, you know, like the mage guilds, and labour guilds?” J half explained. “You know, right?* ***GUILDS*** *are large groups of companies made up of artisans, merchants, or workers belonging to the same trade or craft.” The ranger couldn’t tell that Sylvara still didn’t fully understand, but he wasn't going to stop anyway. “Guilds regulate the trades, maintain quality standards, and provide help and protection for their members.” The nameless, speechless girl seemed surprised by his almost teacher-like information dump that just kept going. It was the first clue for Sylvara that perhaps her lover was different from other northerners.*

*Sylvara tried to process this new information. “Are they new?” was all she could think to say.*

*“Yeah, no,” he answered. “They are old, by human standards, anyway.”*

*The girl tried to hide her judgmental gaze, lifting the hood of her cloak to obscure her expression as she went in, the shop bell easily moved the Ranger’s magpie attention span.*

*A kind lady wild elf, ran the shop, her oak-bark skin almost matching the countertops, which seemed purposefully done. “Welcome, sale on under tunics to any naked clients today only.” She said, sounding like someone's grandmother, she had rolls and rolls of the most beautiful elven robes and simpler choices of dresses and shirts hung around. But none of it mattered when all one was wearing was a blanket. “Here you go, pay when you leave, darling,” the shopkeeper rang out as she passed the pale blue under-tunic.*

*J began to browse the accessories and jewellery, his eyes glinting with a plan, “Nice to hear someone speak common.” It was a guild-owned store, so of course the owner could speak trade speak, common and dwarf as well as her native tongue.* 

*“Too many of us think it below us, are you three looking for anything in particular?” she asked them as Edgar gave out a squawk for feeling left out.*

*The hats were from last year’s designs, but the queen viewed clothes in a new, practical light as she began carefully selecting three outfits each for herself and her newest companion.*

*Sylvara’s emerald eyes assessed the modest shop’s offerings, drawing appreciative glances from the wild elf proprietor as she picked out new practical garments with royal discernment, “No, thank you, shopkeep, we have done clothes shopping before, as we are commoners.” The Ranger thought that to be the weirdest-sounding lie he had ever heard from Sylvara, then, in unison, they realised their new member had no idea who or what Sylvara was or how to tell her. She gave it away a bit with how many shades of purple she could recognise and coordinate together, and topped it with the fact that she needed help in the changing room.*

*It was easy for J to notice Sylvara’s favourite colour. The same went for her noticing his, but she figured it out on the second day.*

*“The palace would offer her protection and purpose,” she mused, her black-painted lips pursing thoughtfully as she assisted the tongueless girl in selecting a simple dress. However, each was turned down in favour of a sleeveless olive tunic made of soft wool and some blue felt leggings with fine tall boots she grasped the moment she heard the word “palace.”*

*“No noble discounts, but I have some finer silk in the back my lady.” the shopkeeper explained.*

*“Oh how did you know? Anyway I am just a very lowborn.” The elven queen shifted as she reached for a sturdy leather bag, slender fingers testing its quality. “This old demon’s sack smells of death and nightmares,” Sylvara remarked, glancing at J. “A lady requires something less… conspicuous.” She picked out a nice bolsón-style pack but paused, watching J examine the brooches and pins with surprising attention to detail. “Though I admit, my northern beast, you’ve taught me much about practicality over appearance,” she added with genuine affection.*

*“I’ll be honest, my queen,” he replied, “my old helmet needs replacing, but I like how scary the teeth are, makes me look like a monster head in a dark alley.” How childlike he could be.*

*The clothes were much cheaper than what the queen was used to, and the nameless girl was happy with her new attire. The white underdress was the only traditional feminine clothing she accepted to take in place of that undertunic, at the same price as well.*

*The queen was pleased with her new, comfortable lavender tunic and dress shirts, which helped her armour fit better as an added bonus. 75gp, 7sp and 25cp, the bill came up to after adding in the undergarments, sleepwear, cloak for the girl and new walking shoes.*

*As they exited the store with a “thank you, darlings,” from the kindest soul around, despite the low bar, J draped something over The Queen’s shoulders. It was the blanket from the inn, along with a brooch featuring a poorly engraved attempt at the royal family crest (a three-branched gold tree in front of a silver moon). “It’s not magic, but it looks nice. My gift to you,” he said, adjusting the blanket into a cloak, a paper receipt was still pinned with the brooch. “I hope you like it? I paid for the brooch.” He couldn't lie, but he could withhold the truth.*

*With a gentle wave of his hand and a bit of nature magic, he summoned a flower from a nearby bush and placed it in her hair with a kiss. “It’s no crown, but…”*

*Sylvara's jewel-like eyes sparkled with genuine delight at the simple gifts and the humble thought behind them. Her elven figure warmed beneath the familiar inn blanket, and her silver hair framed her face beautifully, with the wildflower adding an unexpected charm.*

*“It’s perfect,” she whispered, her black-painted lips curving into a sincere smile as she embraced him before surveying their odd little group, slender fingers adjusting the brooch at her shoulder.*

*“Squawk!”*

*“Okay, everyone, do we need anything else before we leave this village?” J asked, handing over a few “permanently borrowed” items to the girl. A cup, a knife, and a spoon.*

*“I believe we’re prepared for departure,” Sylvara declared, her emerald eyes viewing the collecting crowd of the villagefolk who were just dumb enough to be racist, “Though I wonder if we should name our new companion before we journey onward.”*

*A thousand years of royal formality lingered in her thoughts, yet she found herself charmed by his roguish generosity as they speed walked for the town gate.*

*“Morgan is a common name back in the nor…” His words were cut off as both girls shook their heads.*

*“Okay, how about Fiona?”*

*She shook her head again.* 

*“Agnus? Jermira? Meabh?” He listed off normal names from his homeland, though none seemed appealing to a woman. “What about Mòrag?”*

*Edgar sang a small but sad song, and the girl nodded in response.* 

*J translated, “Deridra?”*

 

*The queen misunderstood the pause. “Who names their child our word for sorrow?” The Ranger asked.*

*The queen had instructed me not to talk about the cat.*

A Girl Has Gone Missin' in the Swamp.,"People think they know strange. Hell, before all this, I thought I did too. You see a lot of shit in the military, even more as a private eye. You think you know people. Well, you don't, trust me. There's a whole layer of filth underneath what you think you know. I thought I'd seen strange. Thought I knew weird. Thought I couldn't be shaken. I was wrong. Findin’ the book changed everythin’ for me. You know that sayin’? If you look into the abyss, the abyss looks back? Well it's true. More true than anythin’. All it takes is a glimpse beneath the veil. I wish I had never taken that last job, but it's too late now. I'm gettin’ ahead of myself. Let me start from the beginnin’.

I work in an old port town in the southern USA. The kind of place with rottin’ docks and always smells like rottin’ fish. The kind of place full of superstitious old-timers nd over the top stories. You won't find us on many current maps. This town hasn't been relevant in a long time. I get most of my work from the nearby city. No, I won't tell you which one. Hell, I won't even tell you the name of this town. Last thing I need is more weirdos comin’ here to go missin’ in the nearby swamps. For the sake of reference though let's call the place Portsmouth, nd you can call me James or Jimmy, local PI. Portsmouth is a rottin’ shell of what it was when I was a kid. Used to be a pretty nice place with lots of work. After the fishin' dried up, nd old mine shut down, it kinda just got forgotten about. Who knew that the mine runoff would send the fish runnin’? Who knew the mine would fall short after a decade of steady output? Not my old man. Not any of the other old-timers either, but that's life I suppose. Now the swamplands creep in on one side of us nd the salt water breaks the other.

So it all started bout two weeks ago. I'd just come down from my upper floor apartment down to my office. I was expectin’ a quiet mornin’ but as I walked to my door to unlock it, I saw a letter layin’ in front of it. I picked it up nd looked at the return address. Ellen Peterson from the city close by. Peterson… I didn't recognize the name. Tearin’ the letter open I looked at the contents. A picture fell out of the folded letter as I opened it up. I picked it up nd saw a young dark haired girl, with bright innocent lookin’ blue eyes nd freckles. I went back to the letter.

Dear Mr. Smith,

I write to you out of desperation. My daughter Mary, who came to Portsmouth to visit her grandfather, has gone missing. I've talked to the sheriff, and all I get is “We are working on it.” It's been three days. I know the time window for her to be alive grows smaller and smaller by the hour. Please accept my case. I'll pay whatever you want. You can start by talking to my father, Elias Bell. Thank you in advance. If you need anything please call me at XXX-XXX-XXXX.

With all hope and sincerity, 

Ellen Peterson

Elias Bell… I knew the old man, nd I knew her too now. Ellen Bell ran off with some rich city boy after high school. I checked my watch. Pretty early. The old men would be at the local diner. I stuffed the letter nd photo in my pocket nd grabbed my coat. I stepped out into the cold, wet, fish smellin’ mornin’ air. Time to work.

I stepped into the diner nd shook off the mornin’ damp as I looked round. As usual the old-timers were all huddled up at the long table in the back. What wasn't usual was the hushed voices instead of the rowdy banter that usually accompanies em. A voice from the counter called out to me.

“Hey Jimmy, here for breakfast?” Said the plump woman behind the bar top.

I looked over nd gave her a small smile, “Not today Eileen. Workin. I'll take a coffee though.” She gave me a small nod nd waddled to the pot, fillin’ up a cup nd handin’ it to me. I took a sip nd headed over to the table. The hushed voices stopped as soon as I neared nd a gruff voice on the opposite side called out.

“Guess you're here to see me, eh boy?” Said a shriveled twig of a man in orange waders.

“Yea Elias, I’m here to see you. Ellen contacted me.” I said quietly lookin’ him in the eye. You had to be respectful with these old-timers. You didn't show respect nd pay your dues to the water nd they wouldn't give you the time of day.

Elias nodded slowly, “She said she would. That useless fuck sheriff hasn’t done a damn thing but sit on his fat ass in that comfy office. I don't know how a beached asshole like him got voted in in the first place.” Said Elias angrily, his fist slammin’ into the table as the other old men nodded at his words.

Sheriff Johnson was a fat old man who basically just filled his position in name only. Most the time if any real work needed to be done in this town it was me or Deputy Bellham doing it. The sheriff never set foot in a boat in his life, therefore he wasn't respected by a single person in this town. Though he might've earned some if he actually did his job. 

“Give me the details Elias. Tell me what happened to Mary.” I said, leanin’ on the end of the heavy wooden table.

Elias looked down into his coffee cup. The other old men just watchin’ him patiently as he seemed to gather his recollection. 

“She's been stayin’ with me bout three weeks. Honestly I was surprised she wanted to come out. Ain't nothin in this town for a girl her age. Maybe it's because I dote on her, or she just wanted to get away from her folks, I don't know."" 

He shook his head slowly for a moment before continuin', “Bout five days ago she said she made a friend. I asked her who, but she brushed me off. She was a good girl, so I didn't push the subject. Next day she went out again, came back nd there was a smell hangin’ on her. I knew it, we all do. That swamp smell. I asked her again, who was this friend? Again she tried to brush me off, but I pushed this time. Asked her if it was one of those swamp-dwellers. She hesitated nd that was confirmation enough for me. Maybe I got a bit stern with her. Told her she knows better. Shouldn't be hangin’ round those swamp folk.” 

He paused for a second nd a single tear rolled down his cragged cheek. “Guess she just wanted to placate me, cuz she said ok, nd she wouldn't see em again. I thought that was the end of it. Went out to sea the next mornin’. When I came back she was gone.” 

An old-timer next to him placed a weathered hand on his shoulder as Elias seemed to sink in on himself. I nodded slowly. Last thing I wanted to do was take a trip to the swamplands, but if that's where the trail led, then that's where I was goin’. 

“Alright Elias, I'll look into it, but you know, three days in the swamp.. You know what I'll probably find right?” I said grimly.

Elias looked me in the eye sternly. “You just bring her back boy. One way or the other nd you'll have our gratitude.” The old-timers all gruffed out their assents.

“Alright.” I said standin’ up, ""I'll contact you when I find somethin’.” With that I downed my coffee nd headed out, puttin’ my mug on the bar.

“Be careful out there Jimmy.” Said Eileen with a worried wrinkle in her brow.

I nodded to her as I walked past nd headed back out into the damp mornin’.

As I walked down the pothole covered road I thought about what to do next. I'd need to prepare. No way I was goin’ into the deep swamp unarmed nd I'd need a guide. There was only one person for that. I took a turn nd headed to the bar nearby. Probably the only place in this town open twenty-four seven.

I pushed open the heavy door nd was greeted by the smell of warm booze nd sawdust. Here nd there the local drunks snoozed or talked to themselves in their seats. The lumberjack of a bartender greeted me as I entered.

“Mornin' Jimmy, what can I get ya?” He said in his low cannon of a voice.

“Nothin’ today, Al. Workin'."" He nodded nd looked to the lean figure sittin’ at the bar. Henry looked like a cowboy tryin' to become an alligator. Wearin’ blue jeans with alligator boots, vest nd hat. He sat there sippin’ on his whiskey. He was a muscular, tanned man in a small lean kind of way. A large bowie knife was strapped to his hip like a promise.

I came over nd sat next to him. didn't say a word, didn't have to. In all likelihood he already knew why I was here. He side-eyed me for a moment nd downed the rest of his glass.

“When we leavin’ Jimmy?” He said in his smooth voice.

“Soon as you can get ready Henry.” I stared at him for a moment as he put his glass on the table nd pushed it away.

“Give me bout an hour nd I'll have the boat ready.” He stood up nd looked at me. “Dwellers been real strange lately, Jimmy. Strap heavy for this one. Not sure how they gunna’ react anymore.” I nodded thoughtfully as he stepped out.

Sighin', I got up off the stool nd headed out myself. I walked to my office stoppin’ momentarily to look out on the water. The dark blue water splashed against the decrepit docks. A few boats that have seen better days floated by the parts that were still usable. I remembered the days helpin’ my dad load the boat before goin’ out. Everythin’ seemed brighter back then. I wondered then if this town would survive my lifetime. I turned away nd stepped into my office.

I went through my apartment grabbin’ my gear. Camo boots, waders nd jacket. My .38 for the inside pocket. My .44 on the side of my hip. I debated on rifle or shotgun. In the end I went with the shotgun. I filled my pockets with ammo. When it came to the swamp nd the dwellers it was best to be prepared for anythin’. Was a time when the dwellers nd us got along alright. These days though they were almost completely isolated nd didn't appreciate visitors. If Henry said they were even stranger now.. Then I wasn't really sure what to expect anymore. I grabbed a backpack with some extra gear. Rope, tape, tarp, whatever might be useful if we got in trouble or had to bring back Mary in the worst case scenario. 

I stepped onto the docks, the weight of my gear remindin' me of my time in the army. Henry sat in his flat bottomed boat. Rifle slung over his shoulder nd pistol strapped to the hip where his knife wasn't. I tossed my bag in nd climbed inside. Henry lit a cigarette before startin’ up the motor. He took a drag nd started movin’ away from the dock. 

We headed up the coast. When we reached the channel that would lead us to the swamplands I looked up from inspectin’ my weapons.

“So how bad is it now, Henry?” I said watchin’ him expertly guide the boat.

Blowin’ out a puff of smoke, Henry looked back at me. “Pretty bad Jimmy. They're more paranoid than ever. More dangerous. Last month I came out to check my traps. Caught one comin’ up behind me, knife out. Fucker was covered in swamp mud, practically naked cept some cloth round his junk. Felt like I was seein’ tribesfolk in the Amazon or somethin’. Couldn’t understand a word the fuck said either before I made him silent.”

I looked at Henry for a long moment. There's an unspoken rule out here. What happens in the swamp stays in the swamp. It rarely happens but this town sometimes takes justice into its own hands. When they do.. They take it to the swamp. I decided I didn't wanna ask anymore questions nd went back to my inspections.

As we headed further inland the tree growth grew thicker, nd the canopy above blocked out the sun. Henry wove us between the trees nd kept us away from too shallow waters. We were movin’ slow. As I looked round I didn't really notice much of anythin’. Then I noticed that I really didn't notice anythin’. No movement. No birds makin’ noise overhead. No movement under the water's surface. Even the flies nd mosquitos were awol.

“Henry what the hell is goin’ on out here?” I asked in a whisper. I'm not sure why, but I had a feelin’ I needed to stay quiet. Had a feelin’ there were eyes on us. Henry just looked back at me. His expression was like stone as he turned back to guide us through. I readied my shotgun nd crouched into a stable position scannin' the area. I couldn't see anythin’, but I knew they were there. My instincts screamed danger as we moved ever deeper into the dark swamp.

Suddenly below us there was a boom. Before I could react the boat flipped up into the air, water splashin’ up round us before I was sinkin’ down in it. The filthy swamp swallowed me. Its foul taste fillin’ my mouth as I struggled to regain my senses. I flipped nd turned, losin’ all sense of direction. Blindly I swam where I thought the surface was, instead I met mud nd roots. Turnin’ I swam the opposite direction. I finally breached the surface inhalin’ the stale air, quickly lookin’ round for Henry. There was land nearby nd on the edge I saw him. Muddy hands dragged him from the water nd held him to the ground. I looked at the savage muddy faces. I couldn't believe these were the same dwellers. They had become absolutely feral, lookin’ like tribesfolk of some kind. As I looked, a figure stepped from the shadows, a woman bare chested nd covered in mud, wearin’ some kind of tribal headdress. 

She knelt down beside Henry as she pulled out the jagged, wicked lookin' dagger, nd he began to fight even harder against his captors. The woman raised the dagger high above her head shoutin’ in some language I'd never heard before, nd then, she looked at me. Bright green eyes looked at me. Too bright. Too green, or not quite green. Pain started to rip through my head as we stared into each other's eyes, but then she turned away, nd plunged the dagger down into Henry's heart. He gasped loudly as the blade struck home, his body twitchin before fallin’ still.

The dwellers stood then, all turnin’ towards me. Green eyes, but not quite green. Slowly they stepped back into the shadows, disappearin’ from view, but I knew they were still there, watchin’ me as I carefully made my way to the muddy earth where Henry lay. I struggled up the muddy banks to Henry's body, catchin’ my breath nd lookin’ down at him. He was gone. His eyes wide in terror nd slack jawed. Lookin’ round me, the shadows of the swamp seemed to deepen. My head felt tight, like somethin’ was pushin’ it from either side. Images of my time in the desert flashed in my head, but they were different, monochrome in color. Grey sands, black rocks nd dark sky, but there was a light somewhere, a greenish light. 

I shook my head nd reached for my weapons. The shotgun was gone nd so was the .38, but my .44 was still strapped to my hip. I pulled it out breathin’ slow, tryin' to calm myself. I scanned the area, but the light of the day was fadin’ fast nd the dark shadows lengthenin’. I took inventory of my ammo, eighteen bullets includin’ what was already loaded. I reached to Henry's side nd grabbed his knife. Then I moved.

The sun began to dip lower as I walked through the stinkin’ mud. I estimated my direction, tryin’ to move south towards the coast. The swamp grew darker nd darker as I stumbled forward. My flashlight was in my pack, lost somewhere in the swamps murky water. So I kept goin’, stayin’ quiet nd watchin’ my surroundin’s. Now nd then I’d see some movement, but it'd be gone as soon as I turned to look. My head seemed pounded harder the further I went. Eventually the sun vanished, plungin’ me into darkness. Through the canopy above I could see some stars, but I couldn't figure em out. Twinklin’ mockeries of our own constellations, but different enough that I couldn't figure out my directions. So I kept on, hopin’ I was movin’ straight, but knowin’ I probably wasn't. 

“James..” A whisper came from my right. I turned, holdin’ my gun forward in front of me. I couldn't see anythin’ but the shadows. They seemed to blur in my vision nd I quickly rubbed my eyes to try nd clear em.

“Come James..” Another from behind me. I spun, wavin’ my revolver side to side, scannin’ the area in front of me. Again nothin’ but blurred, twistin’ shadows.

I started to run. I moved awkward nd slow, the mud suckin’ at my boots with each step. The whispers came again all round me.

“James.. Come James.. Chosen James..” The cacophony of whisperin’ voices. My head pounded. My disorientation buildin’ nd buildin’ till finally I collapsed into the slick mud. 

Then there was light. Green flames lightin' up on torches all round me, held aloft by mud covered, green-eyed dwellers. I sat up raisin’ my gun once again. 

“Stay back!” I screamed as I waved my gun between the dozen or so individuals surroundin’ me. Then I noticed it. As I moved my weapon in front of me, two more torches lit up revealin’ a stone table covered in mold nd a rust colored substance. Round it were corpses, corpses mummified in a wet, sticky way that only a swamp can produce. Two of em were kneelin’ before the stone table, nd held aloft in their hands was a large leather bound book.

The figures of the dwellers stood in place round me. I stood up, gun still raised nd lookin’ at each of em. Then I felt a pull. Somethin’ in my mind tellin’ me to look forward again. I turned back, my eyes fallin’ on the strange book held up in those skeletal hands. Strange words were etched into the leather. 

Liber Smaragdi Luminis Aeterni

A shadow behind the altar seemed to shimmer nd a figure came forward. The woman from before, her green eyes lockin’ on my own as she approached the table. She raised her hands high up into the air.

“Electus Regis Smaragdi Venit! Gaudeamus in eius lapsu ad insaniam!” She yelled over us, her voice manic nd eyes fevered as she looked round.

I looked closer at her mud covered face as she looked at me from behind the altar. A wide grin spread across her face. Then recognition hit me.

“Mary? Mary, your mother sent me! I'm here to help you get home!” I yelled at her. 

She kept starin’ at me. “Domum sum… in lumine ipsius” She whispered at me.

Suddenly pain ripped through my skull nd I dropped to my knees, my vision blurrin'. I looked up to see hollow sockets nd wide toothy grins meet my gaze. An emerald light began to emanate from their dark eyes as skeletal hands grabbed nd held me down. I struggled with all my might as all round me the flames grew brighter as mud covered figures burst into eldritch flame.

I heard Mary's voice rise up, “Recipe nos, Rex Nativus ex Vacuao!” Another bright green flame grew from the direction of the table. Suddenly two green lights filled my vision. My eyes burned nd my head throbbed nd then, everythin’ went dark.

I opened my eyes to that monochrome landscape. Grey sand nd black rock with a toilin’ black sky high above me, but as before there was a light. A light like liquid emerald floatin’ nd reflectin’ off the monochrome surfaces round me. I turned in its direction to see a tall black misshapen tower of inconceivable geometry. At its top was the source of the light. A figure was there, behind its head a halo of that alien light. My mouth gaped open as I dropped to my knees. It was so close, yet so far away, nd to my horror I wanted to be closer. 

Shadowy tendrils slowly slipped down from the roilin’ sky round the figure. It reached a long clawed hand towards me as if beckonin’ me to take it. I reached out to it, nd suddenly I was there, kneelin’ before the loomin’ figure now only a few feet away from me. It turned its faceless head towards me nd reached down. Its large hand pressin’ to my chest. Pain flared from its touch burnin’ me nd forcin’ out a scream I didn't even realize I could emit from my body.

Its voice ripped through my skull, tearin’ my mind apart with each word. “Awaken child and see truth around you.” 

Then darkness took me once again.

I awoke a week later in a hospital bed. Sittin’ in a chair near me was Elias’s bony form. Images of hollow eyes nd skeletal grins flashed through my mind nd I yelped closin’ my eyes nd pressin’ my palms into em.

“Jimmy.. Boy what happened to you out there?” Elias said quietly. I kept my eyes shut.

“Don’t let anyone in the swamp Elias… nobody can go in there!” I practically screamed at him. 

He stepped back warily. “Yeah, okay boy. I'll tell everyone to stay out. Jimmy.. What happened to Mary? To Henry?” He asked hesitantly.

I opened my eyes then nd looked at Elias with a manic expression. “They’re gone Elias! Gone! There's nothin’ left!” I shouted loudly. Elias ran to the door best he could, yellin’ for a doctor to come.

I spent about a month in that hospital. I've forgotten things. I know I have. Everythin’ here is what I can remember. At least I think it is. Honestly I don't know what is completely real about this story anymore. What I do know is that I see things slippin’ into the shadows from the corners of my eye. I know that I have a certain instinct about things now. I know that when I got home the large leather-bound book was sittin’ on my bed. I know the handprint-like scar on my chest shimmers green in a certain light. I know that when I look in the mirror.. I see emerald eyes starin’ back at me.

Deadlines weren’t just approaching - they were ambushing me from all sides. I had multiple essays, a research paper, and one assignment on a topic that sounded more like a bad prank than an academic requirement. Coffee had stopped working, my brain refused to cooperate, and I knew there was no way I could handle all of it on my own.

That’s when I stumbled across a few names that kept popping up whenever people talked about the best essay writing services. At that point, survival was the only strategy, so I decided to test three platforms head-to-head:

A Girl Has Gone Missin' in the Swamp.,"People think they know strange. Hell, before all this, I thought I did too. You see a lot of shit in the military, even more as a private eye. You think you know people. Well, you don't, trust me. There's a whole layer of filth underneath what you think you know. I thought I'd seen strange. Thought I knew weird. Thought I couldn't be shaken. I was wrong. Findin’ the book changed everythin’ for me. You know that sayin’? If you look into the abyss, the abyss looks back? Well it's true. More true than anythin’. All it takes is a glimpse beneath the veil. I wish I had never taken that last job, but it's too late now. I'm gettin’ ahead of myself. Let me start from the beginnin’.

I work in an old port town in the southern USA. The kind of place with rottin’ docks and always smells like rottin’ fish. The kind of place full of superstitious old-timers nd over the top stories. You won't find us on many current maps. This town hasn't been relevant in a long time. I get most of my work from the nearby city. No, I won't tell you which one. Hell, I won't even tell you the name of this town. Last thing I need is more weirdos comin’ here to go missin’ in the nearby swamps. For the sake of reference though let's call the place Portsmouth, nd you can call me James or Jimmy, local PI. Portsmouth is a rottin’ shell of what it was when I was a kid. Used to be a pretty nice place with lots of work. After the fishin' dried up, nd old mine shut down, it kinda just got forgotten about. Who knew that the mine runoff would send the fish runnin’? Who knew the mine would fall short after a decade of steady output? Not my old man. Not any of the other old-timers either, but that's life I suppose. Now the swamplands creep in on one side of us nd the salt water breaks the other.

So it all started bout two weeks ago. I'd just come down from my upper floor apartment down to my office. I was expectin’ a quiet mornin’ but as I walked to my door to unlock it, I saw a letter layin’ in front of it. I picked it up nd looked at the return address. Ellen Peterson from the city close by. Peterson… I didn't recognize the name. Tearin’ the letter open I looked at the contents. A picture fell out of the folded letter as I opened it up. I picked it up nd saw a young dark haired girl, with bright innocent lookin’ blue eyes nd freckles. I went back to the letter.

Dear Mr. Smith,

I write to you out of desperation. My daughter Mary, who came to Portsmouth to visit her grandfather, has gone missing. I've talked to the sheriff, and all I get is “We are working on it.” It's been three days. I know the time window for her to be alive grows smaller and smaller by the hour. Please accept my case. I'll pay whatever you want. You can start by talking to my father, Elias Bell. Thank you in advance. If you need anything please call me at XXX-XXX-XXXX.

With all hope and sincerity, 

Ellen Peterson

Elias Bell… I knew the old man, nd I knew her too now. Ellen Bell ran off with some rich city boy after high school. I checked my watch. Pretty early. The old men would be at the local diner. I stuffed the letter nd photo in my pocket nd grabbed my coat. I stepped out into the cold, wet, fish smellin’ mornin’ air. Time to work.

I stepped into the diner nd shook off the mornin’ damp as I looked round. As usual the old-timers were all huddled up at the long table in the back. What wasn't usual was the hushed voices instead of the rowdy banter that usually accompanies em. A voice from the counter called out to me.

“Hey Jimmy, here for breakfast?” Said the plump woman behind the bar top.

I looked over nd gave her a small smile, “Not today Eileen. Workin. I'll take a coffee though.” She gave me a small nod nd waddled to the pot, fillin’ up a cup nd handin’ it to me. I took a sip nd headed over to the table. The hushed voices stopped as soon as I neared nd a gruff voice on the opposite side called out.

“Guess you're here to see me, eh boy?” Said a shriveled twig of a man in orange waders.

“Yea Elias, I’m here to see you. Ellen contacted me.” I said quietly lookin’ him in the eye. You had to be respectful with these old-timers. You didn't show respect nd pay your dues to the water nd they wouldn't give you the time of day.

Elias nodded slowly, “She said she would. That useless fuck sheriff hasn’t done a damn thing but sit on his fat ass in that comfy office. I don't know how a beached asshole like him got voted in in the first place.” Said Elias angrily, his fist slammin’ into the table as the other old men nodded at his words.

Sheriff Johnson was a fat old man who basically just filled his position in name only. Most the time if any real work needed to be done in this town it was me or Deputy Bellham doing it. The sheriff never set foot in a boat in his life, therefore he wasn't respected by a single person in this town. Though he might've earned some if he actually did his job. 

“Give me the details Elias. Tell me what happened to Mary.” I said, leanin’ on the end of the heavy wooden table.

Elias looked down into his coffee cup. The other old men just watchin’ him patiently as he seemed to gather his recollection. 

“She's been stayin’ with me bout three weeks. Honestly I was surprised she wanted to come out. Ain't nothin in this town for a girl her age. Maybe it's because I dote on her, or she just wanted to get away from her folks, I don't know."" 

He shook his head slowly for a moment before continuin', “Bout five days ago she said she made a friend. I asked her who, but she brushed me off. She was a good girl, so I didn't push the subject. Next day she went out again, came back nd there was a smell hangin’ on her. I knew it, we all do. That swamp smell. I asked her again, who was this friend? Again she tried to brush me off, but I pushed this time. Asked her if it was one of those swamp-dwellers. She hesitated nd that was confirmation enough for me. Maybe I got a bit stern with her. Told her she knows better. Shouldn't be hangin’ round those swamp folk.” 

He paused for a second nd a single tear rolled down his cragged cheek. “Guess she just wanted to placate me, cuz she said ok, nd she wouldn't see em again. I thought that was the end of it. Went out to sea the next mornin’. When I came back she was gone.” 

An old-timer next to him placed a weathered hand on his shoulder as Elias seemed to sink in on himself. I nodded slowly. Last thing I wanted to do was take a trip to the swamplands, but if that's where the trail led, then that's where I was goin’. 

“Alright Elias, I'll look into it, but you know, three days in the swamp.. You know what I'll probably find right?” I said grimly.

Elias looked me in the eye sternly. “You just bring her back boy. One way or the other nd you'll have our gratitude.” The old-timers all gruffed out their assents.

“Alright.” I said standin’ up, ""I'll contact you when I find somethin’.” With that I downed my coffee nd headed out, puttin’ my mug on the bar.

“Be careful out there Jimmy.” Said Eileen with a worried wrinkle in her brow.

I nodded to her as I walked past nd headed back out into the damp mornin’.

As I walked down the pothole covered road I thought about what to do next. I'd need to prepare. No way I was goin’ into the deep swamp unarmed nd I'd need a guide. There was only one person for that. I took a turn nd headed to the bar nearby. Probably the only place in this town open twenty-four seven.

I pushed open the heavy door nd was greeted by the smell of warm booze nd sawdust. Here nd there the local drunks snoozed or talked to themselves in their seats. The lumberjack of a bartender greeted me as I entered.

“Mornin' Jimmy, what can I get ya?” He said in his low cannon of a voice.

“Nothin’ today, Al. Workin'."" He nodded nd looked to the lean figure sittin’ at the bar. Henry looked like a cowboy tryin' to become an alligator. Wearin’ blue jeans with alligator boots, vest nd hat. He sat there sippin’ on his whiskey. He was a muscular, tanned man in a small lean kind of way. A large bowie knife was strapped to his hip like a promise.

I came over nd sat next to him. didn't say a word, didn't have to. In all likelihood he already knew why I was here. He side-eyed me for a moment nd downed the rest of his glass.

“When we leavin’ Jimmy?” He said in his smooth voice.

“Soon as you can get ready Henry.” I stared at him for a moment as he put his glass on the table nd pushed it away.

“Give me bout an hour nd I'll have the boat ready.” He stood up nd looked at me. “Dwellers been real strange lately, Jimmy. Strap heavy for this one. Not sure how they gunna’ react anymore.” I nodded thoughtfully as he stepped out.

Sighin', I got up off the stool nd headed out myself. I walked to my office stoppin’ momentarily to look out on the water. The dark blue water splashed against the decrepit docks. A few boats that have seen better days floated by the parts that were still usable. I remembered the days helpin’ my dad load the boat before goin’ out. Everythin’ seemed brighter back then. I wondered then if this town would survive my lifetime. I turned away nd stepped into my office.

I went through my apartment grabbin’ my gear. Camo boots, waders nd jacket. My .38 for the inside pocket. My .44 on the side of my hip. I debated on rifle or shotgun. In the end I went with the shotgun. I filled my pockets with ammo. When it came to the swamp nd the dwellers it was best to be prepared for anythin’. Was a time when the dwellers nd us got along alright. These days though they were almost completely isolated nd didn't appreciate visitors. If Henry said they were even stranger now.. Then I wasn't really sure what to expect anymore. I grabbed a backpack with some extra gear. Rope, tape, tarp, whatever might be useful if we got in trouble or had to bring back Mary in the worst case scenario. 

I stepped onto the docks, the weight of my gear remindin' me of my time in the army. Henry sat in his flat bottomed boat. Rifle slung over his shoulder nd pistol strapped to the hip where his knife wasn't. I tossed my bag in nd climbed inside. Henry lit a cigarette before startin’ up the motor. He took a drag nd started movin’ away from the dock. 

We headed up the coast. When we reached the channel that would lead us to the swamplands I looked up from inspectin’ my weapons.

“So how bad is it now, Henry?” I said watchin’ him expertly guide the boat.

Blowin’ out a puff of smoke, Henry looked back at me. “Pretty bad Jimmy. They're more paranoid than ever. More dangerous. Last month I came out to check my traps. Caught one comin’ up behind me, knife out. Fucker was covered in swamp mud, practically naked cept some cloth round his junk. Felt like I was seein’ tribesfolk in the Amazon or somethin’. Couldn’t understand a word the fuck said either before I made him silent.”

I looked at Henry for a long moment. There's an unspoken rule out here. What happens in the swamp stays in the swamp. It rarely happens but this town sometimes takes justice into its own hands. When they do.. They take it to the swamp. I decided I didn't wanna ask anymore questions nd went back to my inspections.

As we headed further inland the tree growth grew thicker, nd the canopy above blocked out the sun. Henry wove us between the trees nd kept us away from too shallow waters. We were movin’ slow. As I looked round I didn't really notice much of anythin’. Then I noticed that I really didn't notice anythin’. No movement. No birds makin’ noise overhead. No movement under the water's surface. Even the flies nd mosquitos were awol.

“Henry what the hell is goin’ on out here?” I asked in a whisper. I'm not sure why, but I had a feelin’ I needed to stay quiet. Had a feelin’ there were eyes on us. Henry just looked back at me. His expression was like stone as he turned back to guide us through. I readied my shotgun nd crouched into a stable position scannin' the area. I couldn't see anythin’, but I knew they were there. My instincts screamed danger as we moved ever deeper into the dark swamp.

Suddenly below us there was a boom. Before I could react the boat flipped up into the air, water splashin’ up round us before I was sinkin’ down in it. The filthy swamp swallowed me. Its foul taste fillin’ my mouth as I struggled to regain my senses. I flipped nd turned, losin’ all sense of direction. Blindly I swam where I thought the surface was, instead I met mud nd roots. Turnin’ I swam the opposite direction. I finally breached the surface inhalin’ the stale air, quickly lookin’ round for Henry. There was land nearby nd on the edge I saw him. Muddy hands dragged him from the water nd held him to the ground. I looked at the savage muddy faces. I couldn't believe these were the same dwellers. They had become absolutely feral, lookin’ like tribesfolk of some kind. As I looked, a figure stepped from the shadows, a woman bare chested nd covered in mud, wearin’ some kind of tribal headdress. 

She knelt down beside Henry as she pulled out the jagged, wicked lookin' dagger, nd he began to fight even harder against his captors. The woman raised the dagger high above her head shoutin’ in some language I'd never heard before, nd then, she looked at me. Bright green eyes looked at me. Too bright. Too green, or not quite green. Pain started to rip through my head as we stared into each other's eyes, but then she turned away, nd plunged the dagger down into Henry's heart. He gasped loudly as the blade struck home, his body twitchin before fallin’ still.

The dwellers stood then, all turnin’ towards me. Green eyes, but not quite green. Slowly they stepped back into the shadows, disappearin’ from view, but I knew they were still there, watchin’ me as I carefully made my way to the muddy earth where Henry lay. I struggled up the muddy banks to Henry's body, catchin’ my breath nd lookin’ down at him. He was gone. His eyes wide in terror nd slack jawed. Lookin’ round me, the shadows of the swamp seemed to deepen. My head felt tight, like somethin’ was pushin’ it from either side. Images of my time in the desert flashed in my head, but they were different, monochrome in color. Grey sands, black rocks nd dark sky, but there was a light somewhere, a greenish light. 

I shook my head nd reached for my weapons. The shotgun was gone nd so was the .38, but my .44 was still strapped to my hip. I pulled it out breathin’ slow, tryin' to calm myself. I scanned the area, but the light of the day was fadin’ fast nd the dark shadows lengthenin’. I took inventory of my ammo, eighteen bullets includin’ what was already loaded. I reached to Henry's side nd grabbed his knife. Then I moved.

The sun began to dip lower as I walked through the stinkin’ mud. I estimated my direction, tryin’ to move south towards the coast. The swamp grew darker nd darker as I stumbled forward. My flashlight was in my pack, lost somewhere in the swamps murky water. So I kept goin’, stayin’ quiet nd watchin’ my surroundin’s. Now nd then I’d see some movement, but it'd be gone as soon as I turned to look. My head seemed pounded harder the further I went. Eventually the sun vanished, plungin’ me into darkness. Through the canopy above I could see some stars, but I couldn't figure em out. Twinklin’ mockeries of our own constellations, but different enough that I couldn't figure out my directions. So I kept on, hopin’ I was movin’ straight, but knowin’ I probably wasn't. 

“James..” A whisper came from my right. I turned, holdin’ my gun forward in front of me. I couldn't see anythin’ but the shadows. They seemed to blur in my vision nd I quickly rubbed my eyes to try nd clear em.

“Come James..” Another from behind me. I spun, wavin’ my revolver side to side, scannin’ the area in front of me. Again nothin’ but blurred, twistin’ shadows.

I started to run. I moved awkward nd slow, the mud suckin’ at my boots with each step. The whispers came again all round me.

“James.. Come James.. Chosen James..” The cacophony of whisperin’ voices. My head pounded. My disorientation buildin’ nd buildin’ till finally I collapsed into the slick mud. 

Then there was light. Green flames lightin' up on torches all round me, held aloft by mud covered, green-eyed dwellers. I sat up raisin’ my gun once again. 

“Stay back!” I screamed as I waved my gun between the dozen or so individuals surroundin’ me. Then I noticed it. As I moved my weapon in front of me, two more torches lit up revealin’ a stone table covered in mold nd a rust colored substance. Round it were corpses, corpses mummified in a wet, sticky way that only a swamp can produce. Two of em were kneelin’ before the stone table, nd held aloft in their hands was a large leather bound book.

The figures of the dwellers stood in place round me. I stood up, gun still raised nd lookin’ at each of em. Then I felt a pull. Somethin’ in my mind tellin’ me to look forward again. I turned back, my eyes fallin’ on the strange book held up in those skeletal hands. Strange words were etched into the leather. 

Liber Smaragdi Luminis Aeterni

A shadow behind the altar seemed to shimmer nd a figure came forward. The woman from before, her green eyes lockin’ on my own as she approached the table. She raised her hands high up into the air.

“Electus Regis Smaragdi Venit! Gaudeamus in eius lapsu ad insaniam!” She yelled over us, her voice manic nd eyes fevered as she looked round.

I looked closer at her mud covered face as she looked at me from behind the altar. A wide grin spread across her face. Then recognition hit me.

“Mary? Mary, your mother sent me! I'm here to help you get home!” I yelled at her. 

She kept starin’ at me. “Domum sum… in lumine ipsius” She whispered at me.

Suddenly pain ripped through my skull nd I dropped to my knees, my vision blurrin'. I looked up to see hollow sockets nd wide toothy grins meet my gaze. An emerald light began to emanate from their dark eyes as skeletal hands grabbed nd held me down. I struggled with all my might as all round me the flames grew brighter as mud covered figures burst into eldritch flame.

I heard Mary's voice rise up, “Recipe nos, Rex Nativus ex Vacuao!” Another bright green flame grew from the direction of the table. Suddenly two green lights filled my vision. My eyes burned nd my head throbbed nd then, everythin’ went dark.

I opened my eyes to that monochrome landscape. Grey sand nd black rock with a toilin’ black sky high above me, but as before there was a light. A light like liquid emerald floatin’ nd reflectin’ off the monochrome surfaces round me. I turned in its direction to see a tall black misshapen tower of inconceivable geometry. At its top was the source of the light. A figure was there, behind its head a halo of that alien light. My mouth gaped open as I dropped to my knees. It was so close, yet so far away, nd to my horror I wanted to be closer. 

Shadowy tendrils slowly slipped down from the roilin’ sky round the figure. It reached a long clawed hand towards me as if beckonin’ me to take it. I reached out to it, nd suddenly I was there, kneelin’ before the loomin’ figure now only a few feet away from me. It turned its faceless head towards me nd reached down. Its large hand pressin’ to my chest. Pain flared from its touch burnin’ me nd forcin’ out a scream I didn't even realize I could emit from my body.

Its voice ripped through my skull, tearin’ my mind apart with each word. “Awaken child and see truth around you.” 

Then darkness took me once again.

I awoke a week later in a hospital bed. Sittin’ in a chair near me was Elias’s bony form. Images of hollow eyes nd skeletal grins flashed through my mind nd I yelped closin’ my eyes nd pressin’ my palms into em.

“Jimmy.. Boy what happened to you out there?” Elias said quietly. I kept my eyes shut.

“Don’t let anyone in the swamp Elias… nobody can go in there!” I practically screamed at him. 

He stepped back warily. “Yeah, okay boy. I'll tell everyone to stay out. Jimmy.. What happened to Mary? To Henry?” He asked hesitantly.

I opened my eyes then nd looked at Elias with a manic expression. “They’re gone Elias! Gone! There's nothin’ left!” I shouted loudly. Elias ran to the door best he could, yellin’ for a doctor to come.

I spent about a month in that hospital. I've forgotten things. I know I have. Everythin’ here is what I can remember. At least I think it is. Honestly I don't know what is completely real about this story anymore. What I do know is that I see things slippin’ into the shadows from the corners of my eye. I know that I have a certain instinct about things now. I know that when I got home the large leather-bound book was sittin’ on my bed. I know the handprint-like scar on my chest shimmers green in a certain light. I know that when I look in the mirror.. I see emerald eyes starin’ back at me.

A Girl Has Gone Missin' in the Swamp.,"People think they know strange. Hell, before all this, I thought I did too. You see a lot of shit in the military, even more as a private eye. You think you know people. Well, you don't, trust me. There's a whole layer of filth underneath what you think you know. I thought I'd seen strange. Thought I knew weird. Thought I couldn't be shaken. I was wrong. Findin’ the book changed everythin’ for me. You know that sayin’? If you look into the abyss, the abyss looks back? Well it's true. More true than anythin’. All it takes is a glimpse beneath the veil. I wish I had never taken that last job, but it's too late now. I'm gettin’ ahead of myself. Let me start from the beginnin’.

I work in an old port town in the southern USA. The kind of place with rottin’ docks and always smells like rottin’ fish. The kind of place full of superstitious old-timers nd over the top stories. You won't find us on many current maps. This town hasn't been relevant in a long time. I get most of my work from the nearby city. No, I won't tell you which one. Hell, I won't even tell you the name of this town. Last thing I need is more weirdos comin’ here to go missin’ in the nearby swamps. For the sake of reference though let's call the place Portsmouth, nd you can call me James or Jimmy, local PI. Portsmouth is a rottin’ shell of what it was when I was a kid. Used to be a pretty nice place with lots of work. After the fishin' dried up, nd old mine shut down, it kinda just got forgotten about. Who knew that the mine runoff would send the fish runnin’? Who knew the mine would fall short after a decade of steady output? Not my old man. Not any of the other old-timers either, but that's life I suppose. Now the swamplands creep in on one side of us nd the salt water breaks the other.

So it all started bout two weeks ago. I'd just come down from my upper floor apartment down to my office. I was expectin’ a quiet mornin’ but as I walked to my door to unlock it, I saw a letter layin’ in front of it. I picked it up nd looked at the return address. Ellen Peterson from the city close by. Peterson… I didn't recognize the name. Tearin’ the letter open I looked at the contents. A picture fell out of the folded letter as I opened it up. I picked it up nd saw a young dark haired girl, with bright innocent lookin’ blue eyes nd freckles. I went back to the letter.

Dear Mr. Smith,

I write to you out of desperation. My daughter Mary, who came to Portsmouth to visit her grandfather, has gone missing. I've talked to the sheriff, and all I get is “We are working on it.” It's been three days. I know the time window for her to be alive grows smaller and smaller by the hour. Please accept my case. I'll pay whatever you want. You can start by talking to my father, Elias Bell. Thank you in advance. If you need anything please call me at XXX-XXX-XXXX.

With all hope and sincerity, 

Ellen Peterson

Elias Bell… I knew the old man, nd I knew her too now. Ellen Bell ran off with some rich city boy after high school. I checked my watch. Pretty early. The old men would be at the local diner. I stuffed the letter nd photo in my pocket nd grabbed my coat. I stepped out into the cold, wet, fish smellin’ mornin’ air. Time to work.

I stepped into the diner nd shook off the mornin’ damp as I looked round. As usual the old-timers were all huddled up at the long table in the back. What wasn't usual was the hushed voices instead of the rowdy banter that usually accompanies em. A voice from the counter called out to me.

“Hey Jimmy, here for breakfast?” Said the plump woman behind the bar top.

I looked over nd gave her a small smile, “Not today Eileen. Workin. I'll take a coffee though.” She gave me a small nod nd waddled to the pot, fillin’ up a cup nd handin’ it to me. I took a sip nd headed over to the table. The hushed voices stopped as soon as I neared nd a gruff voice on the opposite side called out.

“Guess you're here to see me, eh boy?” Said a shriveled twig of a man in orange waders.

“Yea Elias, I’m here to see you. Ellen contacted me.” I said quietly lookin’ him in the eye. You had to be respectful with these old-timers. You didn't show respect nd pay your dues to the water nd they wouldn't give you the time of day.

Elias nodded slowly, “She said she would. That useless fuck sheriff hasn’t done a damn thing but sit on his fat ass in that comfy office. I don't know how a beached asshole like him got voted in in the first place.” Said Elias angrily, his fist slammin’ into the table as the other old men nodded at his words.

Sheriff Johnson was a fat old man who basically just filled his position in name only. Most the time if any real work needed to be done in this town it was me or Deputy Bellham doing it. The sheriff never set foot in a boat in his life, therefore he wasn't respected by a single person in this town. Though he might've earned some if he actually did his job. 

“Give me the details Elias. Tell me what happened to Mary.” I said, leanin’ on the end of the heavy wooden table.

Elias looked down into his coffee cup. The other old men just watchin’ him patiently as he seemed to gather his recollection. 

“She's been stayin’ with me bout three weeks. Honestly I was surprised she wanted to come out. Ain't nothin in this town for a girl her age. Maybe it's because I dote on her, or she just wanted to get away from her folks, I don't know."" 

He shook his head slowly for a moment before continuin', “Bout five days ago she said she made a friend. I asked her who, but she brushed me off. She was a good girl, so I didn't push the subject. Next day she went out again, came back nd there was a smell hangin’ on her. I knew it, we all do. That swamp smell. I asked her again, who was this friend? Again she tried to brush me off, but I pushed this time. Asked her if it was one of those swamp-dwellers. She hesitated nd that was confirmation enough for me. Maybe I got a bit stern with her. Told her she knows better. Shouldn't be hangin’ round those swamp folk.” 

He paused for a second nd a single tear rolled down his cragged cheek. “Guess she just wanted to placate me, cuz she said ok, nd she wouldn't see em again. I thought that was the end of it. Went out to sea the next mornin’. When I came back she was gone.” 

An old-timer next to him placed a weathered hand on his shoulder as Elias seemed to sink in on himself. I nodded slowly. Last thing I wanted to do was take a trip to the swamplands, but if that's where the trail led, then that's where I was goin’. 

“Alright Elias, I'll look into it, but you know, three days in the swamp.. You know what I'll probably find right?” I said grimly.

Elias looked me in the eye sternly. “You just bring her back boy. One way or the other nd you'll have our gratitude.” The old-timers all gruffed out their assents.

“Alright.” I said standin’ up, ""I'll contact you when I find somethin’.” With that I downed my coffee nd headed out, puttin’ my mug on the bar.

“Be careful out there Jimmy.” Said Eileen with a worried wrinkle in her brow.

I nodded to her as I walked past nd headed back out into the damp mornin’.

As I walked down the pothole covered road I thought about what to do next. I'd need to prepare. No way I was goin’ into the deep swamp unarmed nd I'd need a guide. There was only one person for that. I took a turn nd headed to the bar nearby. Probably the only place in this town open twenty-four seven.

I pushed open the heavy door nd was greeted by the smell of warm booze nd sawdust. Here nd there the local drunks snoozed or talked to themselves in their seats. The lumberjack of a bartender greeted me as I entered.

“Mornin' Jimmy, what can I get ya?” He said in his low cannon of a voice.

“Nothin’ today, Al. Workin'."" He nodded nd looked to the lean figure sittin’ at the bar. Henry looked like a cowboy tryin' to become an alligator. Wearin’ blue jeans with alligator boots, vest nd hat. He sat there sippin’ on his whiskey. He was a muscular, tanned man in a small lean kind of way. A large bowie knife was strapped to his hip like a promise.

I came over nd sat next to him. didn't say a word, didn't have to. In all likelihood he already knew why I was here. He side-eyed me for a moment nd downed the rest of his glass.

“When we leavin’ Jimmy?” He said in his smooth voice.

“Soon as you can get ready Henry.” I stared at him for a moment as he put his glass on the table nd pushed it away.

“Give me bout an hour nd I'll have the boat ready.” He stood up nd looked at me. “Dwellers been real strange lately, Jimmy. Strap heavy for this one. Not sure how they gunna’ react anymore.” I nodded thoughtfully as he stepped out.

Sighin', I got up off the stool nd headed out myself. I walked to my office stoppin’ momentarily to look out on the water. The dark blue water splashed against the decrepit docks. A few boats that have seen better days floated by the parts that were still usable. I remembered the days helpin’ my dad load the boat before goin’ out. Everythin’ seemed brighter back then. I wondered then if this town would survive my lifetime. I turned away nd stepped into my office.

I went through my apartment grabbin’ my gear. Camo boots, waders nd jacket. My .38 for the inside pocket. My .44 on the side of my hip. I debated on rifle or shotgun. In the end I went with the shotgun. I filled my pockets with ammo. When it came to the swamp nd the dwellers it was best to be prepared for anythin’. Was a time when the dwellers nd us got along alright. These days though they were almost completely isolated nd didn't appreciate visitors. If Henry said they were even stranger now.. Then I wasn't really sure what to expect anymore. I grabbed a backpack with some extra gear. Rope, tape, tarp, whatever might be useful if we got in trouble or had to bring back Mary in the worst case scenario. 

I stepped onto the docks, the weight of my gear remindin' me of my time in the army. Henry sat in his flat bottomed boat. Rifle slung over his shoulder nd pistol strapped to the hip where his knife wasn't. I tossed my bag in nd climbed inside. Henry lit a cigarette before startin’ up the motor. He took a drag nd started movin’ away from the dock. 

We headed up the coast. When we reached the channel that would lead us to the swamplands I looked up from inspectin’ my weapons.

“So how bad is it now, Henry?” I said watchin’ him expertly guide the boat.

Blowin’ out a puff of smoke, Henry looked back at me. “Pretty bad Jimmy. They're more paranoid than ever. More dangerous. Last month I came out to check my traps. Caught one comin’ up behind me, knife out. Fucker was covered in swamp mud, practically naked cept some cloth round his junk. Felt like I was seein’ tribesfolk in the Amazon or somethin’. Couldn’t understand a word the fuck said either before I made him silent.”

I looked at Henry for a long moment. There's an unspoken rule out here. What happens in the swamp stays in the swamp. It rarely happens but this town sometimes takes justice into its own hands. When they do.. They take it to the swamp. I decided I didn't wanna ask anymore questions nd went back to my inspections.

As we headed further inland the tree growth grew thicker, nd the canopy above blocked out the sun. Henry wove us between the trees nd kept us away from too shallow waters. We were movin’ slow. As I looked round I didn't really notice much of anythin’. Then I noticed that I really didn't notice anythin’. No movement. No birds makin’ noise overhead. No movement under the water's surface. Even the flies nd mosquitos were awol.

“Henry what the hell is goin’ on out here?” I asked in a whisper. I'm not sure why, but I had a feelin’ I needed to stay quiet. Had a feelin’ there were eyes on us. Henry just looked back at me. His expression was like stone as he turned back to guide us through. I readied my shotgun nd crouched into a stable position scannin' the area. I couldn't see anythin’, but I knew they were there. My instincts screamed danger as we moved ever deeper into the dark swamp.

Suddenly below us there was a boom. Before I could react the boat flipped up into the air, water splashin’ up round us before I was sinkin’ down in it. The filthy swamp swallowed me. Its foul taste fillin’ my mouth as I struggled to regain my senses. I flipped nd turned, losin’ all sense of direction. Blindly I swam where I thought the surface was, instead I met mud nd roots. Turnin’ I swam the opposite direction. I finally breached the surface inhalin’ the stale air, quickly lookin’ round for Henry. There was land nearby nd on the edge I saw him. Muddy hands dragged him from the water nd held him to the ground. I looked at the savage muddy faces. I couldn't believe these were the same dwellers. They had become absolutely feral, lookin’ like tribesfolk of some kind. As I looked, a figure stepped from the shadows, a woman bare chested nd covered in mud, wearin’ some kind of tribal headdress. 

She knelt down beside Henry as she pulled out the jagged, wicked lookin' dagger, nd he began to fight even harder against his captors. The woman raised the dagger high above her head shoutin’ in some language I'd never heard before, nd then, she looked at me. Bright green eyes looked at me. Too bright. Too green, or not quite green. Pain started to rip through my head as we stared into each other's eyes, but then she turned away, nd plunged the dagger down into Henry's heart. He gasped loudly as the blade struck home, his body twitchin before fallin’ still.

The dwellers stood then, all turnin’ towards me. Green eyes, but not quite green. Slowly they stepped back into the shadows, disappearin’ from view, but I knew they were still there, watchin’ me as I carefully made my way to the muddy earth where Henry lay. I struggled up the muddy banks to Henry's body, catchin’ my breath nd lookin’ down at him. He was gone. His eyes wide in terror nd slack jawed. Lookin’ round me, the shadows of the swamp seemed to deepen. My head felt tight, like somethin’ was pushin’ it from either side. Images of my time in the desert flashed in my head, but they were different, monochrome in color. Grey sands, black rocks nd dark sky, but there was a light somewhere, a greenish light. 

I shook my head nd reached for my weapons. The shotgun was gone nd so was the .38, but my .44 was still strapped to my hip. I pulled it out breathin’ slow, tryin' to calm myself. I scanned the area, but the light of the day was fadin’ fast nd the dark shadows lengthenin’. I took inventory of my ammo, eighteen bullets includin’ what was already loaded. I reached to Henry's side nd grabbed his knife. Then I moved.

The sun began to dip lower as I walked through the stinkin’ mud. I estimated my direction, tryin’ to move south towards the coast. The swamp grew darker nd darker as I stumbled forward. My flashlight was in my pack, lost somewhere in the swamps murky water. So I kept goin’, stayin’ quiet nd watchin’ my surroundin’s. Now nd then I’d see some movement, but it'd be gone as soon as I turned to look. My head seemed pounded harder the further I went. Eventually the sun vanished, plungin’ me into darkness. Through the canopy above I could see some stars, but I couldn't figure em out. Twinklin’ mockeries of our own constellations, but different enough that I couldn't figure out my directions. So I kept on, hopin’ I was movin’ straight, but knowin’ I probably wasn't. 

“James..” A whisper came from my right. I turned, holdin’ my gun forward in front of me. I couldn't see anythin’ but the shadows. They seemed to blur in my vision nd I quickly rubbed my eyes to try nd clear em.

“Come James..” Another from behind me. I spun, wavin’ my revolver side to side, scannin’ the area in front of me. Again nothin’ but blurred, twistin’ shadows.

I started to run. I moved awkward nd slow, the mud suckin’ at my boots with each step. The whispers came again all round me.

“James.. Come James.. Chosen James..” The cacophony of whisperin’ voices. My head pounded. My disorientation buildin’ nd buildin’ till finally I collapsed into the slick mud. 

Then there was light. Green flames lightin' up on torches all round me, held aloft by mud covered, green-eyed dwellers. I sat up raisin’ my gun once again. 

“Stay back!” I screamed as I waved my gun between the dozen or so individuals surroundin’ me. Then I noticed it. As I moved my weapon in front of me, two more torches lit up revealin’ a stone table covered in mold nd a rust colored substance. Round it were corpses, corpses mummified in a wet, sticky way that only a swamp can produce. Two of em were kneelin’ before the stone table, nd held aloft in their hands was a large leather bound book.

The figures of the dwellers stood in place round me. I stood up, gun still raised nd lookin’ at each of em. Then I felt a pull. Somethin’ in my mind tellin’ me to look forward again. I turned back, my eyes fallin’ on the strange book held up in those skeletal hands. Strange words were etched into the leather. 

Liber Smaragdi Luminis Aeterni

A shadow behind the altar seemed to shimmer nd a figure came forward. The woman from before, her green eyes lockin’ on my own as she approached the table. She raised her hands high up into the air.

“Electus Regis Smaragdi Venit! Gaudeamus in eius lapsu ad insaniam!” She yelled over us, her voice manic nd eyes fevered as she looked round.

I looked closer at her mud covered face as she looked at me from behind the altar. A wide grin spread across her face. Then recognition hit me.

“Mary? Mary, your mother sent me! I'm here to help you get home!” I yelled at her. 

She kept starin’ at me. “Domum sum… in lumine ipsius” She whispered at me.

Suddenly pain ripped through my skull nd I dropped to my knees, my vision blurrin'. I looked up to see hollow sockets nd wide toothy grins meet my gaze. An emerald light began to emanate from their dark eyes as skeletal hands grabbed nd held me down. I struggled with all my might as all round me the flames grew brighter as mud covered figures burst into eldritch flame.

I heard Mary's voice rise up, “Recipe nos, Rex Nativus ex Vacuao!” Another bright green flame grew from the direction of the table. Suddenly two green lights filled my vision. My eyes burned nd my head throbbed nd then, everythin’ went dark.

I opened my eyes to that monochrome landscape. Grey sand nd black rock with a toilin’ black sky high above me, but as before there was a light. A light like liquid emerald floatin’ nd reflectin’ off the monochrome surfaces round me. I turned in its direction to see a tall black misshapen tower of inconceivable geometry. At its top was the source of the light. A figure was there, behind its head a halo of that alien light. My mouth gaped open as I dropped to my knees. It was so close, yet so far away, nd to my horror I wanted to be closer. 

Shadowy tendrils slowly slipped down from the roilin’ sky round the figure. It reached a long clawed hand towards me as if beckonin’ me to take it. I reached out to it, nd suddenly I was there, kneelin’ before the loomin’ figure now only a few feet away from me. It turned its faceless head towards me nd reached down. Its large hand pressin’ to my chest. Pain flared from its touch burnin’ me nd forcin’ out a scream I didn't even realize I could emit from my body.

Its voice ripped through my skull, tearin’ my mind apart with each word. “Awaken child and see truth around you.” 

Then darkness took me once again.

I awoke a week later in a hospital bed. Sittin’ in a chair near me was Elias’s bony form. Images of hollow eyes nd skeletal grins flashed through my mind nd I yelped closin’ my eyes nd pressin’ my palms into em.

He stepped back warily. “Yeah, okay boy. I'll tell everyone to stay out. Jimmy.. What happened to Mary? To Henry?” He asked hesitantly.

“Mornin' Jimmy, what can I get ya?” He said in his low cannon of a voice.

“Nothin’ today, Al. Workin'."" He nodded nd looked to the lean figure sittin’ at the bar. Henry looked like a cowboy tryin' to become an alligator. Wearin’ blue jeans with alligator boots, vest nd hat. He sat there sippin’ on his whiskey. He was a muscular, tanned man in a small lean kind of way. A large bowie knife was strapped to his hip like a promise.

I came over nd sat next to him. didn't say a word, didn't have to. In all likelihood he already knew why I was here. He side-eyed me for a moment nd downed the rest of his glass.

“When we leavin’ Jimmy?” He said in his smooth voice.

“Soon as you can get ready Henry.” I stared at him for a moment as he put his glass on the table nd pushed it away.

“Give me bout an hour nd I'll have the boat ready.” He stood up nd looked at me. “Dwellers been real strange lately, Jimmy. Strap heavy for this one. Not sure how they gunna’ react anymore.” I nodded thoughtfully as he stepped out.

Sighin', I got up off the stool nd headed out myself. I walked to my office stoppin’ momentarily to look out on the water. The dark blue water splashed against the decrepit docks. A few boats that have seen better days floated by the parts that were still usable. I remembered the days helpin’ my dad load the boat before goin’ out. Everythin’ seemed brighter back then. I wondered then if this town would survive my lifetime. I turned away nd stepped into my office.

I went through my apartment grabbin’ my gear. Camo boots, waders nd jacket. My .38 for the inside pocket. My .44 on the side of my hip. I debated on rifle or shotgun. In the end I went with the shotgun. I filled my pockets with ammo. When it came to the swamp nd the dwellers it was best to be prepared for anythin’. Was a time when the dwellers nd us got along alright. These days though they were almost completely isolated nd didn't appreciate visitors. If Henry said they were even stranger now.. Then I wasn't really sure what to expect anymore. I grabbed a backpack with some extra gear. Rope, tape, tarp, whatever might be useful if we got in trouble or had to bring back Mary in the worst case scenario. 

I stepped onto the docks, the weight of my gear remindin' me of my time in the army. Henry sat in his flat bottomed boat. Rifle slung over his shoulder nd pistol strapped to the hip where his knife wasn't. I tossed my bag in nd climbed inside. Henry lit a cigarette before startin’ up the motor. He took a drag nd started movin’ away from the dock. 

We headed up the coast. When we reached the channel that would lead us to the swamplands I looked up from inspectin’ my weapons.

“So how bad is it now, Henry?” I said watchin’ him expertly guide the boat.

Blowin’ out a puff of smoke, Henry looked back at me. “Pretty bad Jimmy. They're more paranoid than ever. More dangerous. Last month I came out to check my traps. Caught one comin’ up behind me, knife out. Fucker was covered in swamp mud, practically naked cept some cloth round his junk. Felt like I was seein’ tribesfolk in the Amazon or somethin’. Couldn’t understand a word the fuck said either before I made him silent.”

I looked at Henry for a long moment. There's an unspoken rule out here. What happens in the swamp stays in the swamp. It rarely happens but this town sometimes takes justice into its own hands. When they do.. They take it to the swamp. I decided I didn't wanna ask anymore questions nd went back to my inspections.

As we headed further inland the tree growth grew thicker, nd the canopy above blocked out the sun. Henry wove us between the trees nd kept us away from too shallow waters. We were movin’ slow. As I looked round I didn't really notice much of anythin’. Then I noticed that I really didn't notice anythin’. No movement. No birds makin’ noise overhead. No movement under the water's surface. Even the flies nd mosquitos were awol.

“Henry what the hell is goin’ on out here?” I asked in a whisper. I'm not sure why, but I had a feelin’ I needed to stay quiet. Had a feelin’ there were eyes on us. Henry just looked back at me. His expression was like stone as he turned back to guide us through. I readied my shotgun nd crouched into a stable position scannin' the area. I couldn't see anythin’, but I knew they were there. My instincts screamed danger as we moved ever deeper into the dark swamp.

Suddenly below us there was a boom. Before I could react the boat flipped up into the air, water splashin’ up round us before I was sinkin’ down in it. The filthy swamp swallowed me. Its foul taste fillin’ my mouth as I struggled to regain my senses. I flipped nd turned, losin’ all sense of direction. Blindly I swam where I thought the surface was, instead I met mud nd roots. Turnin’ I swam the opposite direction. I finally breached the surface inhalin’ the stale air, quickly lookin’ round for Henry. There was land nearby nd on the edge I saw him. Muddy hands dragged him from the water nd held him to the ground. I looked at the savage muddy faces. I couldn't believe these were the same dwellers. They had become absolutely feral, lookin’ like tribesfolk of some kind. As I looked, a figure stepped from the shadows, a woman bare chested nd covered in mud, wearin’ some kind of tribal headdress. 

She knelt down beside Henry as she pulled out the jagged, wicked lookin' dagger, nd he began to fight even harder against his captors. The woman raised the dagger high above her head shoutin’ in some language I'd never heard before, nd then, she looked at me. Bright green eyes looked at me. Too bright. Too green, or not quite green. Pain started to rip through my head as we stared into each other's eyes, but then she turned away, nd plunged the dagger down into Henry's heart. He gasped loudly as the blade struck home, his body twitchin before fallin’ still.

The dwellers stood then, all turnin’ towards me. Green eyes, but not quite green. Slowly they stepped back into the shadows, disappearin’ from view, but I knew they were still there, watchin’ me as I carefully made my way to the muddy earth where Henry lay. I struggled up the muddy banks to Henry's body, catchin’ my breath nd lookin’ down at him. He was gone. His eyes wide in terror nd slack jawed. Lookin’ round me, the shadows of the swamp seemed to deepen. My head felt tight, like somethin’ was pushin’ it from either side. Images of my time in the desert flashed in my head, but they were different, monochrome in color. Grey sands, black rocks nd dark sky, but there was a light somewhere, a greenish light. 

I shook my head nd reached for my weapons. The shotgun was gone nd so was the .38, but my .44 was still strapped to my hip. I pulled it out breathin’ slow, tryin' to calm myself. I scanned the area, but the light of the day was fadin’ fast nd the dark shadows lengthenin’. I took inventory of my ammo, eighteen bullets includin’ what was already loaded. I reached to Henry's side nd grabbed his knife. Then I moved.

The sun began to dip lower as I walked through the stinkin’ mud. I estimated my direction, tryin’ to move south towards the coast. The swamp grew darker nd darker as I stumbled forward. My flashlight was in my pack, lost somewhere in the swamps murky water. So I kept goin’, stayin’ quiet nd watchin’ my surroundin’s. Now nd then I’d see some movement, but it'd be gone as soon as I turned to look. My head seemed pounded harder the further I went. Eventually the sun vanished, plungin’ me into darkness. Through the canopy above I could see some stars, but I couldn't figure em out. Twinklin’ mockeries of our own constellations, but different enough that I couldn't figure out my directions. So I kept on, hopin’ I was movin’ straight, but knowin’ I probably wasn't. 

“James..” A whisper came from my right. I turned, holdin’ my gun forward in front of me. I couldn't see anythin’ but the shadows. They seemed to blur in my vision nd I quickly rubbed my eyes to try nd clear em.

“Come James..” Another from behind me. I spun, wavin’ my revolver side to side, scannin’ the area in front of me. Again nothin’ but blurred, twistin’ shadows.

I started to run. I moved awkward nd slow, the mud suckin’ at my boots with each step. The whispers came again all round me.

“James.. Come James.. Chosen James..” The cacophony of whisperin’ voices. My head pounded. My disorientation buildin’ nd buildin’ till finally I collapsed into the slick mud. 

Then there was light. Green flames lightin' up on torches all round me, held aloft by mud covered, green-eyed dwellers. I sat up raisin’ my gun once again. 

“Stay back!” I screamed as I waved my gun between the dozen or so individuals surroundin’ me. Then I noticed it. As I moved my weapon in front of me, two more torches lit up revealin’ a stone table covered in mold nd a rust colored substance. Round it were corpses, corpses mummified in a wet, sticky way that only a swamp can produce. Two of em were kneelin’ before the stone table, nd held aloft in their hands was a large leather bound book.

The figures of the dwellers stood in place round me. I stood up, gun still raised nd lookin’ at each of em. Then I felt a pull. Somethin’ in my mind tellin’ me to look forward again. I turned back, my eyes fallin’ on the strange book held up in those skeletal hands. Strange words were etched into the leather. 

Liber Smaragdi Luminis Aeterni

A shadow behind the altar seemed to shimmer nd a figure came forward. The woman from before, her green eyes lockin’ on my own as she approached the table. She raised her hands high up into the air.

“Electus Regis Smaragdi Venit! Gaudeamus in eius lapsu ad insaniam!” She yelled over us, her voice manic nd eyes fevered as she looked round.

I looked closer at her mud covered face as she looked at me from behind the altar. A wide grin spread across her face. Then recognition hit me.

“Mary? Mary, your mother sent me! I'm here to help you get home!” I yelled at her. 

She kept starin’ at me. “Domum sum… in lumine ipsius” She whispered at me.

Suddenly pain ripped through my skull nd I dropped to my knees, my vision blurrin'. I looked up to see hollow sockets nd wide toothy grins meet my gaze. An emerald light began to emanate from their dark eyes as skeletal hands grabbed nd held me down. I struggled with all my might as all round me the flames grew brighter as mud covered figures burst into eldritch flame.

I heard Mary's voice rise up, “Recipe nos, Rex Nativus ex Vacuao!” Another bright green flame grew from the direction of the table. Suddenly two green lights filled my vision. My eyes burned nd my head throbbed nd then, everythin’ went dark.

I opened my eyes to that monochrome landscape. Grey sand nd black rock with a toilin’ black sky high above me, but as before there was a light. A light like liquid emerald floatin’ nd reflectin’ off the monochrome surfaces round me. I turned in its direction to see a tall black misshapen tower of inconceivable geometry. At its top was the source of the light. A figure was there, behind its head a halo of that alien light. My mouth gaped open as I dropped to my knees. It was so close, yet so far away, nd to my horror I wanted to be closer. 

Shadowy tendrils slowly slipped down from the roilin’ sky round the figure. It reached a long clawed hand towards me as if beckonin’ me to take it. I reached out to it, nd suddenly I was there, kneelin’ before the loomin’ figure now only a few feet away from me. It turned its faceless head towards me nd reached down. Its large hand pressin’ to my chest. Pain flared from its touch burnin’ me nd forcin’ out a scream I didn't even realize I could emit from my body.

Its voice ripped through my skull, tearin’ my mind apart with each word. “Awaken child and see truth around you.” 

Then darkness took me once again.

I awoke a week later in a hospital bed. Sittin’ in a chair near me was Elias’s bony form. Images of hollow eyes nd skeletal grins flashed through my mind nd I yelped closin’ my eyes nd pressin’ my palms into em.

“Jimmy.. Boy what happened to you out there?” Elias said quietly. I kept my eyes shut.

“Don’t let anyone in the swamp Elias… nobody can go in there!” I practically screamed at him. 

He stepped back warily. “Yeah, okay boy. I'll tell everyone to stay out. Jimmy.. What happened to Mary? To Henry?” He asked hesitantly.

I opened my eyes then nd looked at Elias with a manic expression. “They’re gone Elias! Gone! There's nothin’ left!” I shouted loudly. Elias ran to the door best he could, yellin’ for a doctor to come.

I spent about a month in that hospital. I've forgotten things. I know I have. Everythin’ here is what I can remember. At least I think it is. Honestly I don't know what is completely real about this story anymore. What I do know is that I see things slippin’ into the shadows from the corners of my eye. I know that I have a certain instinct about things now. I know that when I got home the large leather-bound book was sittin’ on my bed. I know the handprint-like scar on my chest shimmers green in a certain light. I know that when I look in the mirror.. I see emerald eyes starin’ back at me.

1nqza6o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nqza6o,"same pod, way less crema with new VertuoPlus Deluxe?","so my sister has a VertuoPlus (Breville) that I was using rather religiously for the past 6 months while I was living with her, I LOVE it especially because every single pod produces a very generous amount of crema, which I personally need in my coffees. Now that I have my own place, I wanted to invest in one as well, and found a bundle deal from Amazon on the VertuoPlus Deluxe (Delonghi) so I went ahead and bought it - I thought why not, the regular VertuoPlus and VertuoPlus Deluxe are the same machine functionally, just that the Deluxe has a larger tank and chrome bits… however after setting up and cleaning the machine etc, I find that the coffee brewed is super watery / burnt tasting and does not produce any crema… and I know it’s definitely a difference in machine not pod, because I’m using the exact same pod I always use, I’ve also tried it with the 3 different flavored pods I always use. Does anyone know if this is a fault with the machine - regular vs deluxe VertuoPlus , or the brand (Breville v.s. DeLonghi )? Is there any way around this ? My coffee tastes so bad and there’s no point in keeping it if I don’t like the coffee and I’m just wasting pods, so I’d rather just return it at this point. Also I don’t know if I’m overthinking , but when I unboxed it even though it was sealed properly with tape and saran wrap there was dust all over the machine … makes me wonder if it’s either a really old model or one that has been used and returned …any advice or experiences would be appreciated ty!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

A Girl Has Gone Missin' in the Swamp.,"People think they know strange. Hell, before all this, I thought I did too. You see a lot of shit in the military, even more as a private eye. You think you know people. Well, you don't, trust me. There's a whole layer of filth underneath what you think you know. I thought I'd seen strange. Thought I knew weird. Thought I couldn't be shaken. I was wrong. Findin’ the book changed everythin’ for me. You know that sayin’? If you look into the abyss, the abyss looks back? Well it's true. More true than anythin’. All it takes is a glimpse beneath the veil. I wish I had never taken that last job, but it's too late now. I'm gettin’ ahead of myself. Let me start from the beginnin’.

I work in an old port town in the southern USA. The kind of place with rottin’ docks and always smells like rottin’ fish. The kind of place full of superstitious old-timers nd over the top stories. You won't find us on many current maps. This town hasn't been relevant in a long time. I get most of my work from the nearby city. No, I won't tell you which one. Hell, I won't even tell you the name of this town. Last thing I need is more weirdos comin’ here to go missin’ in the nearby swamps. For the sake of reference though let's call the place Portsmouth, nd you can call me James or Jimmy, local PI. Portsmouth is a rottin’ shell of what it was when I was a kid. Used to be a pretty nice place with lots of work. After the fishin' dried up, nd old mine shut down, it kinda just got forgotten about. Who knew that the mine runoff would send the fish runnin’? Who knew the mine would fall short after a decade of steady output? Not my old man. Not any of the other old-timers either, but that's life I suppose. Now the swamplands creep in on one side of us nd the salt water breaks the other.

So it all started bout two weeks ago. I'd just come down from my upper floor apartment down to my office. I was expectin’ a quiet mornin’ but as I walked to my door to unlock it, I saw a letter layin’ in front of it. I picked it up nd looked at the return address. Ellen Peterson from the city close by. Peterson… I didn't recognize the name. Tearin’ the letter open I looked at the contents. A picture fell out of the folded letter as I opened it up. I picked it up nd saw a young dark haired girl, with bright innocent lookin’ blue eyes nd freckles. I went back to the letter.

Dear Mr. Smith,



I write to you out of desperation. My daughter Mary, who came to Portsmouth to visit her grandfather, has gone missing. I've talked to the sheriff, and all I get is “We are working on it.” It's been three days. I know the time window for her to be alive grows smaller and smaller by the hour. Please accept my case. I'll pay whatever you want. You can start by talking to my father, Elias Bell. Thank you in advance. If you need anything please call me at XXX-XXX-XXXX.



With all hope and sincerity, 

Ellen Peterson

Elias Bell… I knew the old man, nd I knew her too now. Ellen Bell ran off with some rich city boy after high school. I checked my watch. Pretty early. The old men would be at the local diner. I stuffed the letter nd photo in my pocket nd grabbed my coat. I stepped out into the cold, wet, fish smellin’ mornin’ air. Time to work.

I stepped into the diner nd shook off the mornin’ damp as I looked round. As usual the old-timers were all huddled up at the long table in the back. What wasn't usual was the hushed voices instead of the rowdy banter that usually accompanies em. A voice from the counter called out to me.

“Hey Jimmy, here for breakfast?” Said the plump woman behind the bar top.

I looked over nd gave her a small smile, “Not today Eileen. Workin. I'll take a coffee though.” She gave me a small nod nd waddled to the pot, fillin’ up a cup nd handin’ it to me. I took a sip nd headed over to the table. The hushed voices stopped as soon as I neared nd a gruff voice on the opposite side called out.

“Guess you're here to see me, eh boy?” Said a shriveled twig of a man in orange waders.

“Yea Elias, I’m here to see you. Ellen contacted me.” I said quietly lookin’ him in the eye. You had to be respectful with these old-timers. You didn't show respect nd pay your dues to the water nd they wouldn't give you the time of day.

Elias nodded slowly, “She said she would. That useless fuck sheriff hasn’t done a damn thing but sit on his fat ass in that comfy office. I don't know how a beached asshole like him got voted in in the first place.” Said Elias angrily, his fist slammin’ into the table as the other old men nodded at his words.

Sheriff Johnson was a fat old man who basically just filled his position in name only. Most the time if any real work needed to be done in this town it was me or Deputy Bellham doing it. The sheriff never set foot in a boat in his life, therefore he wasn't respected by a single person in this town. Though he might've earned some if he actually did his job. 

“Give me the details Elias. Tell me what happened to Mary.” I said, leanin’ on the end of the heavy wooden table.

Elias looked down into his coffee cup. The other old men just watchin’ him patiently as he seemed to gather his recollection. 

“She's been stayin’ with me bout three weeks. Honestly I was surprised she wanted to come out. Ain't nothin in this town for a girl her age. Maybe it's because I dote on her, or she just wanted to get away from her folks, I don't know."" 

He shook his head slowly for a moment before continuin', “Bout five days ago she said she made a friend. I asked her who, but she brushed me off. She was a good girl, so I didn't push the subject. Next day she went out again, came back nd there was a smell hangin’ on her. I knew it, we all do. That swamp smell. I asked her again, who was this friend? Again she tried to brush me off, but I pushed this time. Asked her if it was one of those swamp-dwellers. She hesitated nd that was confirmation enough for me. Maybe I got a bit stern with her. Told her she knows better. Shouldn't be hangin’ round those swamp folk.” 

He paused for a second nd a single tear rolled down his cragged cheek. “Guess she just wanted to placate me, cuz she said ok, nd she wouldn't see em again. I thought that was the end of it. Went out to sea the next mornin’. When I came back she was gone.” 

An old-timer next to him placed a weathered hand on his shoulder as Elias seemed to sink in on himself. I nodded slowly. Last thing I wanted to do was take a trip to the swamplands, but if that's where the trail led, then that's where I was goin’. 

“Alright Elias, I'll look into it, but you know, three days in the swamp.. You know what I'll probably find right?” I said grimly.

Elias looked me in the eye sternly. “You just bring her back boy. One way or the other nd you'll have our gratitude.” The old-timers all gruffed out their assents.

“Alright.” I said standin’ up, ""I'll contact you when I find somethin’.” With that I downed my coffee nd headed out, puttin’ my mug on the bar.

“Be careful out there Jimmy.” Said Eileen with a worried wrinkle in her brow.

I nodded to her as I walked past nd headed back out into the damp mornin’.

As I walked down the pothole covered road I thought about what to do next. I'd need to prepare. No way I was goin’ into the deep swamp unarmed nd I'd need a guide. There was only one person for that. I took a turn nd headed to the bar nearby. Probably the only place in this town open twenty-four seven.

I pushed open the heavy door nd was greeted by the smell of warm booze nd sawdust. Here nd there the local drunks snoozed or talked to themselves in their seats. The lumberjack of a bartender greeted me as I entered.

“Mornin' Jimmy, what can I get ya?” He said in his low cannon of a voice.

“Nothin’ today, Al. Workin'."" He nodded nd looked to the lean figure sittin’ at the bar. Henry looked like a cowboy tryin' to become an alligator. Wearin’ blue jeans with alligator boots, vest nd hat. He sat there sippin’ on his whiskey. He was a muscular, tanned man in a small lean kind of way. A large bowie knife was strapped to his hip like a promise.

I came over nd sat next to him. didn't say a word, didn't have to. In all likelihood he already knew why I was here. He side-eyed me for a moment nd downed the rest of his glass.

“When we leavin’ Jimmy?” He said in his smooth voice.

“Soon as you can get ready Henry.” I stared at him for a moment as he put his glass on the table nd pushed it away.

“Give me bout an hour nd I'll have the boat ready.” He stood up nd looked at me. “Dwellers been real strange lately, Jimmy. Strap heavy for this one. Not sure how they gunna’ react anymore.” I nodded thoughtfully as he stepped out.

Sighin', I got up off the stool nd headed out myself. I walked to my office stoppin’ momentarily to look out on the water. The dark blue water splashed against the decrepit docks. A few boats that have seen better days floated by the parts that were still usable. I remembered the days helpin’ my dad load the boat before goin’ out. Everythin’ seemed brighter back then. I wondered then if this town would survive my lifetime. I turned away nd stepped into my office.

I went through my apartment grabbin’ my gear. Camo boots, waders nd jacket. My .38 for the inside pocket. My .44 on the side of my hip. I debated on rifle or shotgun. In the end I went with the shotgun. I filled my pockets with ammo. When it came to the swamp nd the dwellers it was best to be prepared for anythin’. Was a time when the dwellers nd us got along alright. These days though they were almost completely isolated nd didn't appreciate visitors. If Henry said they were even stranger now.. Then I wasn't really sure what to expect anymore. I grabbed a backpack with some extra gear. Rope, tape, tarp, whatever might be useful if we got in trouble or had to bring back Mary in the worst case scenario. 

I stepped onto the docks, the weight of my gear remindin' me of my time in the army. Henry sat in his flat bottomed boat. Rifle slung over his shoulder nd pistol strapped to the hip where his knife wasn't. I tossed my bag in nd climbed inside. Henry lit a cigarette before startin’ up the motor. He took a drag nd started movin’ away from the dock. 

We headed up the coast. When we reached the channel that would lead us to the swamplands I looked up from inspectin’ my weapons.

“So how bad is it now, Henry?” I said watchin’ him expertly guide the boat.

Blowin’ out a puff of smoke, Henry looked back at me. “Pretty bad Jimmy. They're more paranoid than ever. More dangerous. Last month I came out to check my traps. Caught one comin’ up behind me, knife out. Fucker was covered in swamp mud, practically naked cept some cloth round his junk. Felt like I was seein’ tribesfolk in the Amazon or somethin’. Couldn’t understand a word the fuck said either before I made him silent.”

I looked at Henry for a long moment. There's an unspoken rule out here. What happens in the swamp stays in the swamp. It rarely happens but this town sometimes takes justice into its own hands. When they do.. They take it to the swamp. I decided I didn't wanna ask anymore questions nd went back to my inspections.

As we headed further inland the tree growth grew thicker, nd the canopy above blocked out the sun. Henry wove us between the trees nd kept us away from too shallow waters. We were movin’ slow. As I looked round I didn't really notice much of anythin’. Then I noticed that I really didn't notice anythin’. No movement. No birds makin’ noise overhead. No movement under the water's surface. Even the flies nd mosquitos were awol.

“Henry what the hell is goin’ on out here?” I asked in a whisper. I'm not sure why, but I had a feelin’ I needed to stay quiet. Had a feelin’ there were eyes on us. Henry just looked back at me. His expression was like stone as he turned back to guide us through. I readied my shotgun nd crouched into a stable position scannin' the area. I couldn't see anythin’, but I knew they were there. My instincts screamed danger as we moved ever deeper into the dark swamp.

Suddenly below us there was a boom. Before I could react the boat flipped up into the air, water splashin’ up round us before I was sinkin’ down in it. The filthy swamp swallowed me. Its foul taste fillin’ my mouth as I struggled to regain my senses. I flipped nd turned, losin’ all sense of direction. Blindly I swam where I thought the surface was, instead I met mud nd roots. Turnin’ I swam the opposite direction. I finally breached the surface inhalin’ the stale air, quickly lookin’ round for Henry. There was land nearby nd on the edge I saw him. Muddy hands dragged him from the water nd held him to the ground. I looked at the savage muddy faces. I couldn't believe these were the same dwellers. They had become absolutely feral, lookin’ like tribesfolk of some kind. As I looked, a figure stepped from the shadows, a woman bare chested nd covered in mud, wearin’ some kind of tribal headdress. 

She knelt down beside Henry as she pulled out the jagged, wicked lookin' dagger, nd he began to fight even harder against his captors. The woman raised the dagger high above her head shoutin’ in some language I'd never heard before, nd then, she looked at me. Bright green eyes looked at me. Too bright. Too green, or not quite green. Pain started to rip through my head as we stared into each other's eyes, but then she turned away, nd plunged the dagger down into Henry's heart. He gasped loudly as the blade struck home, his body twitchin before fallin’ still.

The dwellers stood then, all turnin’ towards me. Green eyes, but not quite green. Slowly they stepped back into the shadows, disappearin’ from view, but I knew they were still there, watchin’ me as I carefully made my way to the muddy earth where Henry lay. I struggled up the muddy banks to Henry's body, catchin’ my breath nd lookin’ down at him. He was gone. His eyes wide in terror nd slack jawed. Lookin’ round me, the shadows of the swamp seemed to deepen. My head felt tight, like somethin’ was pushin’ it from either side. Images of my time in the desert flashed in my head, but they were different, monochrome in color. Grey sands, black rocks nd dark sky, but there was a light somewhere, a greenish light. 

I shook my head nd reached for my weapons. The shotgun was gone nd so was the .38, but my .44 was still strapped to my hip. I pulled it out breathin’ slow, tryin' to calm myself. I scanned the area, but the light of the day was fadin’ fast nd the dark shadows lengthenin’. I took inventory of my ammo, eighteen bullets includin’ what was already loaded. I reached to Henry's side nd grabbed his knife. Then I moved.

The sun began to dip lower as I walked through the stinkin’ mud. I estimated my direction, tryin’ to move south towards the coast. The swamp grew darker nd darker as I stumbled forward. My flashlight was in my pack, lost somewhere in the swamps murky water. So I kept goin’, stayin’ quiet nd watchin’ my surroundin’s. Now nd then I’d see some movement, but it'd be gone as soon as I turned to look. My head seemed pounded harder the further I went. Eventually the sun vanished, plungin’ me into darkness. Through the canopy above I could see some stars, but I couldn't figure em out. Twinklin’ mockeries of our own constellations, but different enough that I couldn't figure out my directions. So I kept on, hopin’ I was movin’ straight, but knowin’ I probably wasn't. 

“James..” A whisper came from my right. I turned, holdin’ my gun forward in front of me. I couldn't see anythin’ but the shadows. They seemed to blur in my vision nd I quickly rubbed my eyes to try nd clear em.

“Come James..” Another from behind me. I spun, wavin’ my revolver side to side, scannin’ the area in front of me. Again nothin’ but blurred, twistin’ shadows.

I started to run. I moved awkward nd slow, the mud suckin’ at my boots with each step. The whispers came again all round me.

“James.. Come James.. Chosen James..” The cacophony of whisperin’ voices. My head pounded. My disorientation buildin’ nd buildin’ till finally I collapsed into the slick mud. 

Then there was light. Green flames lightin' up on torches all round me, held aloft by mud covered, green-eyed dwellers. I sat up raisin’ my gun once again. 

“Stay back!” I screamed as I waved my gun between the dozen or so individuals surroundin’ me. Then I noticed it. As I moved my weapon in front of me, two more torches lit up revealin’ a stone table covered in mold nd a rust colored substance. Round it were corpses, corpses mummified in a wet, sticky way that only a swamp can produce. Two of em were kneelin’ before the stone table, nd held aloft in their hands was a large leather bound book.

The figures of the dwellers stood in place round me. I stood up, gun still raised nd lookin’ at each of em. Then I felt a pull. Somethin’ in my mind tellin’ me to look forward again. I turned back, my eyes fallin’ on the strange book held up in those skeletal hands. Strange words were etched into the leather. 

Liber Smaragdi Luminis Aeterni

A shadow behind the altar seemed to shimmer nd a figure came forward. The woman from before, her green eyes lockin’ on my own as she approached the table. She raised her hands high up into the air.

“Electus Regis Smaragdi Venit! Gaudeamus in eius lapsu ad insaniam!” She yelled over us, her voice manic nd eyes fevered as she looked round.

I looked closer at her mud covered face as she looked at me from behind the altar. A wide grin spread across her face. Then recognition hit me.

“Mary? Mary, your mother sent me! I'm here to help you get home!” I yelled at her. 

She kept starin’ at me. “Domum sum… in lumine ipsius” She whispered at me.

Suddenly pain ripped through my skull nd I dropped to my knees, my vision blurrin'. I looked up to see hollow sockets nd wide toothy grins meet my gaze. An emerald light began to emanate from their dark eyes as skeletal hands grabbed nd held me down. I struggled with all my might as all round me the flames grew brighter as mud covered figures burst into eldritch flame.

I heard Mary's voice rise up, “Recipe nos, Rex Nativus ex Vacuao!” Another bright green flame grew from the direction of the table. Suddenly two green lights filled my vision. My eyes burned nd my head throbbed nd then, everythin’ went dark.

I opened my eyes to that monochrome landscape. Grey sand nd black rock with a toilin’ black sky high above me, but as before there was a light. A light like liquid emerald floatin’ nd reflectin’ off the monochrome surfaces round me. I turned in its direction to see a tall black misshapen tower of inconceivable geometry. At its top was the source of the light. A figure was there, behind its head a halo of that alien light. My mouth gaped open as I dropped to my knees. It was so close, yet so far away, nd to my horror I wanted to be closer. 

Shadowy tendrils slowly slipped down from the roilin’ sky round the figure. It reached a long clawed hand towards me as if beckonin’ me to take it. I reached out to it, nd suddenly I was there, kneelin’ before the loomin’ figure now only a few feet away from me. It turned its faceless head towards me nd reached down. Its large hand pressin’ to my chest. Pain flared from its touch burnin’ me nd forcin’ out a scream I didn't even realize I could emit from my body.

Its voice ripped through my skull, tearin’ my mind apart with each word. “Awaken child and see truth around you.” 

Then darkness took me once again.

I awoke a week later in a hospital bed. Sittin’ in a chair near me was Elias’s bony form. Images of hollow eyes nd skeletal grins flashed through my mind nd I yelped closin’ my eyes nd pressin’ my palms into em.

“Jimmy.. Boy what happened to you out there?” Elias said quietly. I kept my eyes shut.

“Don’t let anyone in the swamp Elias… nobody can go in there!” I practically screamed at him. 

He stepped back warily. “Yeah, okay boy. I'll tell everyone to stay out. Jimmy.. What happened to Mary? To Henry?” He asked hesitantly.

I opened my eyes then nd looked at Elias with a manic expression. “They’re gone Elias! Gone! There's nothin’ left!” I shouted loudly. Elias ran to the door best he could, yellin’ for a doctor to come.

I spent about a month in that hospital. I've forgotten things. I know I have. Everythin’ here is what I can remember. At least I think it is. Honestly I don't know what is completely real about this story anymore. What I do know is that I see things slippin’ into the shadows from the corners of my eye. I know that I have a certain instinct about things now. I know that when I got home the large leather-bound book was sittin’ on my bed. I know the handprint-like scar on my chest shimmers green in a certain light. I know that when I look in the mirror.. I see emerald eyes starin’ back at me.

Ciara

I looked around the men's boutique shop, my eyes scanning for the perfect gift for my husband; Ryan as it was our 1st anniversary.

Picking up the brown tie that caught my eye, a smile spread across my face. The shop attendant could see that I was pleased.

""I guess this is the one you are going with?"" she questioned; pleased on her part that she'd finally satisfied me.

""Yes, please""

""Then, let me wrap it up for you?""

I handed the tie over to her, ""Thank you""

Whilst the attendant wrapped my gift for Ryan, I couldn't help but remember how we'd first met. It was in a hospital; the same day I'd lost my parents in a car accident.

Ryan happened to have also been involved in a car accident. One thing led to another, I began curious to know the cause of his accidents I'd started working in his house as his caregiver before I knew what was happening next, I was signing a form for a contract marriage with him.

It seemed like a good idea because Ryan seemed like a good guy to me at that time and truthfully, I have never regretted being married to him.

Ryan treats me with respect, way more than I deserved even though our marriage was by name only so this tie I was getting him for our first anniversary didn't even come close for all he's done for me.

""Here you go"" The shop attendant said handing me a disposable bag.

Taking the bag from her hand; I say with a smile, ""Thank you""

As I leave the boutique, I send a quick text to Ryan; ""I'll be at the coffee shop shortly"" it read.

""Take your time"" came his reply but I was giddy as I couldn't contain my happiness.

Climbing into my car, I gently placed the disposable bag at the back of the car seat before taking off.

While humming to my favourite song over the radio, I wondered if today would be a good day to make my feelings known to Ryan.

""You can't be married for over a year without any feelings involved"" I muttered under my breath but was still highly conflicted, ""But what if my confession drives him away? That's the last thing I want to happen right now""

I shake my head, dissing the thought. ""Let's hold back for one more day. You are married to him, Ciara. You can always tell him about your feelings tomorrow""

As the coffee shop we were supposed to meet up in; CARLA'S M came to sight, I shook off the last surge of tension that coursed through my veins as I packed my car in the parking lot before lighting down with the disposable bag in my hands.

Pushing the front door of the coffee shop open, I walked in; my eyes searching frantically for Ryan when suddenly my gaze landed on him.

He was looking at his phone with a worried expression written all over his face. He was claded in a brown suit, his brown hair was neatly styled to the back.

I gawked so hard at this fantasy man in front of me and didn't snap out of it until my phone rang.

Ryan's eyes met mine and immediately, he rushed up to meet me, ""Why didn't you let me know you were here already? I was worried sick""

I smiled shyly, ""I'm sorry""

""Follow me"" Ryan led me to our table where he signaled for the waiter, ""We'll have it now""

""You already ordered?"" I asked Ryan when the waiter was gone.

""You like taking hot coffee after a long drive""

This. This little gestures of Ryan, him remembering what I liked and what I didn't like despite us being in a contract marriage, made me fall in love with him.

On his part it could just be that he was being 'kind' or being a 'nice' guy, maybe it was just me reading too much into his actions, I don't know.

But these feelings of mine, I was ready to keep to myself until Ryan was ready to take the next step with me.

""That's right, I got you something"" We say in unison as I couldn't help but blush at the fact that he remembered what today was.

""You go first"" I say shyly as Ryan brought out a brown envelope from within his bag and handed it over to me.

""What is this?"" I questioned nervously.

Ryan flashed me an encouraging smile, ""Don't be nervous. Go ahead and open it""

I took that as a sign; A good sign that whatever was inside this brown envelope was something I'd like.

It made me more certain about my feeling for Ryan. Today, I thought. I was going to tell him about my feelings for him today.

This envelope, this gift of his to me had only proven that Ryan felt the same way as me and that conclusion made my hands tremble as I opened the envelope.

My eyes met Ryan's once more as I saw a paper inside the brown envelope.

""Continue"" Ryan encouraged and I did. I brought out the paper that was buried inside the envelope and read it's content.

No sooner had I been able to digest the information from the piece of paper, did it fall from my hands.

My whole body began to quiver as I looked up at Ryan who wore a smug or was it? I couldn't tell as my vision was blurred with tears.

""What is the meaning of this?"" I questioned still in disbelief. Where had it all gone wrong? We were happy, he respected me and so did I…I even fell in love with him so how could he do this to me?!.

""It's exactly what it says in the paper, Ciara""

""And what is that?"" I stubbornly inquired. It was as if I didn't want to believe what the paper read until Ryan says it with his own mouth.

A part of me still wanted to fight for whatever we still have left; still wanted to protect our marriage.

But then he'd said it. Ryan had uttered those words I so desperately dreaded,""I want a divorce, Ciara""

Chapter 2: PLEASE, LET MY MAN GO Ciara The feeling is quite describable. It was as if one minute I was flying up in the sky and the next minute, I landed hard on the ground without knowing why. But if it was going to end this way, I needed to know why; I deserved that much courtesy. ""W-Why?"" I inquired with a shaky voice, bringing my hands to dab away at the tears that rolled down my cheeks; I wasn't going to let others watch me cry. Never. While I was on the verge of a mental breakdown, it iriked me that Ryan; my instigator seemed to be doing just fine. Ryan shrugged his shoulders, ""Do I need a reason to file for a divorce?"" I clenched my fist stop hard underneath the table; if not, I would have slapped him hard across the face. ""You need a reason if you want me to sign these papers"", I counterattacked. Not that I was going to sign it anyways. Ryan reclined his back against the chair as he heaved a heavy sigh, ""Let's see. Where do I start from? You are a bad cook, bad when it comes to our personal hygiene. I mean, last time I came home I saw my sock on the kitchen sink. Who does that?"" I tightened my fist, ""It was just that one time and I'd gone on a business trip. Couldn't you take care of that yourself?"" Ryan shook his head; disgusted, ""No. If I could do that myself, why would I have married you?"" I felt my heart fall to my stomach. This man didn't really understand the amount of hurt his words were causing me, ""Then why did you marry me? Did I beg you? No, you are the one who brought up the idea in the first place so why am I suddenly the bad person!?"" ""I don't know, you just are!"" Ryan counterattacked,""So back to my reasons…"" ""Enough. I've heard enough"" ""Wait, this is a really good one. Here it goes.."" Ryan paused,""The king reason for our divorce is most especially for this. You are terrible in bed"" His last words cut me deep like a knife. I let out an exasperated short laugh as I remembered those moments when Ryan would tell me he loves me or peck me softly on the cheeks. I should have known better than to let myself believe that he was actually in love with me. The corners of my lips lit up, ""Are you sure I'm the one who is terrible in bed? Last time we checked, you're the one who couldn't get IT up"" Ryan banged his fist on the table; angry, ""Hey!"" ""What?!"" I shouted, not caring if we were attracting the crowd, ""Are you the only one who gets to say harsh words? Can't I share my own thoughts?"" I wave the paper Infront of him,""I won't be signing these divorce papers"" I moved to stand up from my seat but Ryan held me back, ""Hey, are you really going to be this way? Why won't you sign the papers? Why?!"" Ryan let out an heavy sigh; he was clearly frustrated, ""Do you want to destroy my happiness?!"" Dear lord, this is way too much for me to handle, ""I'm destroying your happiness? ""Of course!"" ""Please can you two take this outside!?"" A customer yelled. ""Exactly!"" ""And you ma'am, just sign those papers. Must you be with someone like him?!"" ""You can do so much better in my opinion!"" I dabbed at my cheeks as I bowed down; apologizing to the customers, ""I sincerely apologize for ruining your day, everyone"" With that said, I bolted out of the coffee shop; hailing the first taxi that stopped Infront of me and heading straight home. What a way to remember our first anniversary! And to think I'd bought him a tie!?. Frustrated to the peek, I threw the disposable bag; which housed the tie out the taxi window as I silently sobbed till I got to my destination. When I'd gotten home, I'd payed the taxi driver whilst dragging my feet to the house front gate. Memories of when we'd first arrived here threatened to pass through my head; I couldn't help it either. I'd shared a whole lifetime of mine with this man. Everywhere I went, anything I bought were all bound to remind me of him. It was going to be hard for me to accept this fact that Ryan was repulsed by me all along but most especially, it was going to be hard for me to move on. ""There has to be something more to this"" I muttered under my breathe, ""Was he being threatened or to do this or…"" I shake my head; clearing the thought off as soon as possible. I couldn't believe that Ryan had hurt me this evening more times than I could count but yet, here I was; Still worried about him. ""Madam.."" A young lady called out to me, approaching me. She was dressed in a yellow long sleeve top and a red skirt just a little bit above her knees. There was a sling bag over her shoulders. She looked quite familiar…where had I seen her before?. ""Me?"" ""Yes, you. Who else would I be speaking to?"" She questioned in a harsh, strong tone; one I didn't like and didn't have the time to tolerate as my world was crashing beneath my feet this evening. I crossed my arms; ready for a fight, ""Who are you?"" The lady infront of me shoved her phone into my face; relieving pictures of her and my husband, sorry scratch that; Ryan being all lovey dovey together; Sharing kisses, feeding eachother, going to karaokes. I couldn't seem to understand what was going on this evening; I'd obviously taking more than I could chew so when does it end!? ""Who am I, you asked?"" The lady questioned, ""I'm Ryan's girlfriend. I came to you to ask you for just one favor"" She held my hands as if her life depended on it, ""Please, let my man go""

Chapter 3: SEE YOU IN COURT Ciara It felt as if I'd just be hit over by a brick; or was it something worse? I don't know. All I knew was that right now..right Infront of me was proof that my husband has been cheating on me all along. ""Aren't you going to say something? Cat's got your tongue?"" The lady, Anne Infront of me questioned furiously. It was such a shame that she thought I was the one who stole something from her and not the other way around. I scoffed absentmindedly muttering under my breath,""So Ryan even kept me a secret all the while from the women he played with?"" ""What did you say?"" Shaking my head; I voiced out aloud, ""I've heard you so for now, can you please go?"" I had a lot to deal with already and I'd clearly decided that I've had enough for one day so with that said, I'd turned away from her heading into the house but Anne had grabbed my wrist; holding me back, ""Hey, I'm not done yet!"" There and then, I lost my cool. All my pent up frustration and anger I'd bottled up all evening finally exploded. ""Please!"" I shouted breaking down into tears, ""Please, just go"" Shaking her wrist off me, I head into the house; slamming the door shut as I crumbled down to the ground, wailing in my own sorrow and misery. Why was this happening to me? Why?. Placing my hands over my mouth, I tried to stiffle my tears but the more I tried, the more my tears flowed. As I struggled to get back on my feet, I decides that I've had enough. Enough of Ryan, enough of this house, enough of everything. Making my way to what used to be our bedroom, I brought out my traveling box from ontop the wardrobe. Flinging the wardrobe wide open, I threw my clothes into the box in a frenzy with teary eyes. This. This was going to be the last time anyone hurt me this way again. I swear it. While packing up my belongings, I heard the main door open but didn't even bother to look in it's direction because was certain that it was no other than Ryan. ""Are you finally leaving?"" Ryan questioned with a mocking tone. Just when I decided to spare him a glance, I saw 'her' beside him. I scoffed. So he was going as far as bringing her into our house now?. Shaking my head, I diverted my gaze away from them; dragging my box closer to my drawer as I threw my jewelleries in. Ryan held my hand as if stopping me but his gesture only iriked me. ""Would you let go off me!"" ""I don't want to touch you either but where do you think you are taking those jewelleries to?. I was the one who bought them for you!"" I laughed. For the first time since the events of this disastrous evening played out, I had a good laugh. ""You bought it for me?"" I questioned, ""Don't be absurd. You didn't even buy me a single flower talkless of these jewelleries"" I free myself from his grasp as I continued with what I was doing. When I was all packed up, I angrily threw the divorce paper that had been in my hands all evening on the reading table and scribbled my signature across it. ""Aren't you being too absurd?"" Anne questioned with irritation all over her face. It took every bit of self control in my body for me not to hit her. She's the one who had ruined our one year of marriage, what seemed to be the perfect marriage I could ever imagine. What right did she have to be irritated?!. ""I mean.."" Anne dragged out regardless, ""You two weren't even in a real marriage"" I knew it. She knew Ryan was married. Afterall, why wouldn't she? She was the reason behind Ryan and I's contractual marriage. Whilst I'd worked as a caregiver for Ryan, his mother had forced him into getting married with Anne but he didn't want to and rather we'd gotten married. Now seeing Ryan with the girl he'd used me for did kind of sting. Anne scoffed, ""Don't tell me you actually fell in love with Ryan now, did you?"" I did and trust me, I regret every single moment of it, ""No, why would I? Ryan isn't actually someone who deserves love. Isn't that why you are with him?"" ""Hey!"" ""Listen to me good and listen well. Just because Ryan and I just got divorced because of you doesn't mean he actually loves you. He cheated on me despite being in a fake relationship as you've said so can you imagine what's going to happen to you?"" Ryan pushed me backwards,""Hey, if you are done packing your things then hurry up and leave. I won't tolerate you talking down at me in my own house"" ""In your own house?"" I inquired gazing around the house I'd built with my hard earned money and sweat,""The whole plot of land, the house, 1.3billion dollars, the cars…"" ""Hey, what are you saying?"" Ryan stuttered. ""What? Are you scared? Or is it now you remember that you didn't contribute a dime into our marriage? Don't worry, you won't be penniless. You and your girlfriend can feed and grow on your 'love' daily"" ""And to be honest, you are quite well off too. Your company is doing well for the now so, remember all I said before? That's just a tip of the iceberg on the divorce alimony"" I pressed his shoulder down as I whispered into his ears, ""So honey, make sure to come with a good lawyer and try to fight me for all the things you didn't work hard for. I'll be waiting"" I bowed at Anne, ""I wish you two a happy married life or whatever you want to do yourselves"" Turning back to face Ryan, I flashed him a sweet smile. A smile of victory because I was finally convinced that even if I was going down, I wasn't going down in shame. Slapping the divorce papers against his chest; I say through gritted teeths, ""See you in court"" Chapter 4: HER MILLION QUESTIONS! Ryan As I watched Ciara walk away from me; from our home, my blood began to boil. Turning to face Anne; I spat out, ""Why did you come here?"" Anne scoffed, ""Babe, you can't actually be angry with me right now, can you? She is the one who didn't know her place. I was setting things right!""

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1nqz62d,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nqz62d/motion_detected/,Motion Detected,"I'm staying at a motel tonight. I can't go home. I can't even think about going home.

Let me start from the beginning because I need to get this down while I can still remember it clearly. Before it gets worse.

Three weeks ago I bought a security camera. Basic motion detection, sends alerts to my phone. I live alone in this duplex I've been renting for two years. Quiet neighborhood, never had any problems, but my bike got stolen from the front porch last month so I figured why not.

Setup was easy. Pointed it at the living room, tested it a few times. Worked perfectly. My cat would set it off, I'd get the alert, delete the clip. Normal stuff.

Then last Monday I started getting alerts while I was at work. But when I'd check the video, nothing was there. Just my empty living room. I figured it was a software glitch—the motion detection was triggering randomly. Annoying but not exactly concerning.

Tuesday, same thing. Wednesday, more alerts. But Thursday the video files started corrupting. I'd get the alert, tap to view, and instead of video I'd get these glitched-out frames. Pixelated garbage that hurt to look at. The file would say five seconds but play nothing useful.

I called customer service Friday. They had me reset everything, reinstall the app, check my WiFi. Nothing fixed it. The guy said sometimes electromagnetic interference can cause issues. Old wiring, nearby electronics, stuff like that. Made sense enough.

Weekend was quiet. No alerts at all. I actually forgot about the whole thing.

Monday morning I woke up to thirty-seven alerts from overnight.

All corrupted video. All between 2 AM and 5 AM. But this time, some of the files had audio tracks attached. Most were just silence or static. But the file from 3:22 AM had something else.

Breathing. Slow, deep breathing. The kind you do when you're unconscious. And I recognized it immediately because I have mild sleep apnea. That little catch at the end of each exhale? That's mine.

But I was in my bedroom. Door closed. The camera is in the living room, twenty feet away through two doorways.

I played it maybe fifteen times, trying to convince myself I was wrong. That it was wind through a gap somewhere, or the heater cycling on. But no. That breathing pattern, that specific rhythm—I'd heard it on the sleep study recordings my doctor made me do last year. It was definitely me.

The thing is, motion-activated cameras only record when something moves. So for it to have captured audio of my breathing, something had to trigger it. Something had to be moving in my living room while I slept.

I checked every inch of the house that morning. Every closet, under the bed, behind doors. I even went outside and walked the perimeter, looking for any way someone could get in. Nothing. All the windows were locked from the inside. The back door was deadbolted. No signs of entry anywhere.

But the alerts kept coming. Every night, dozens of them. All corrupted video, but more audio files now. Always recordings of me sleeping. Sometimes just breathing, sometimes I was talking in my sleep. Fragments of conversations, words I couldn't quite make out.

The weird thing about the sleep-talking clips was that they sounded like responses. Like I was having a conversation with someone. But I live alone. I've never been a sleep-talker. And when I played them for my ex-girlfriend over the phone, she said she'd never heard me do that in the three years we dated.

Friday night I decided to stay awake and watch the live feed. See if I could catch whatever was triggering the motion detection. I made coffee, set up on the couch with my laptop, and kept the camera app open.

At 1:47 AM, I got an alert.

I was staring directly at the live feed when it happened. The living room was completely still. I was sitting right there—I could see myself in the corner of the frame. Nothing moved. But my phone buzzed with the motion alert anyway.

The recorded file was corrupted, as usual. But there was audio. Three seconds this time.

It was my voice, but not from that night. I recognized what I was saying because I'd said it earlier that day on a work call: ""Yeah, I can get that to you by Wednesday."" But in the audio clip, my voice sounded different. Flatter. Like someone doing an impression of me.

That's when I realized something I should have noticed earlier. In all these audio clips, I never sounded quite right. The breathing was mine, the voice was mine, but something was always slightly off. The timing, the inflection. Like listening to yourself on a recording, but worse.

Saturday I bought a second camera and hid it in my bedroom, pointed at my bed. If something was somehow getting audio of me sleeping, I wanted to see what was happening.

Sunday morning, I had forty-three alerts from the living room camera. All corrupted video, all with audio of me sleeping. But the bedroom camera? Nothing. It hadn't triggered once all night.

That doesn't make sense. If the living room camera was picking up audio of me sleeping, and I was sleeping in my bedroom, then the bedroom camera should have captured something too. The motion, the sound, whatever was causing it.

Unless the audio wasn't being recorded in real-time.

I started going through all the clips more carefully, trying to identify when each piece of audio had actually been recorded. The breathing from Monday night? I recognized it from the previous Thursday—I'd had a stuffy nose and was mouth-breathing. The sleep-talking from Wednesday? That was definitely from a conversation I'd had with my mother on Tuesday, but played back in fragments, out of order.

Someone was collecting recordings of my voice and breathing, then somehow attaching them to these corrupted video files. But that's impossible. The camera system is encrypted. You can't just edit the files. And besides, who would do that? And how would they even get recordings of me in the first place?

Monday night I tried something different. I slept on the couch, right in front of the camera. If something was triggering the motion detection, I'd be right there. I'd see it.

I set up my phone to record video of me sleeping, just to have a backup. Then I positioned myself directly in the camera's view and tried to sleep.

I woke up at 6 AM to find my phone dead. Completely drained battery, even though it had been at 80% when I went to sleep. The charger was unplugged from the wall.

And I had sixty-one alerts from the living room camera.

Every single video file was corrupted. But the audio... Christ, the audio was different this time.

It wasn't just recordings of me sleeping. There were conversations. Full conversations between me and someone else. I could hear both voices clearly. Mine, and another voice that sounded exactly like mine.

In one clip, I heard myself ask, ""How long have you been here?"" And the other voice—my voice—answered, ""Long enough to learn everything I need.""

In another: ""What do you want?"" ""I want what you have. Your life. It looks comfortable.""

The conversations went on for hours across all the clips. I was apparently having long, detailed discussions with someone while I slept. Someone who sounded exactly like me. We talked about my job, my daily routine, my passwords, my bank account details. I gave this person—myself?—a complete rundown of my entire life.

But I don't remember any of it. I've never had conversations like that, asleep or awake.

I called my doctor Monday afternoon. Made an emergency appointment. I was thinking maybe I was having some kind of psychological break. Dissociative episodes. Something medical that would explain all this.

But the doctor couldn't see me until Wednesday. And Tuesday night, everything changed.

I didn't get any alerts Tuesday night. None. The camera app showed no motion detected all night long. I actually slept well for the first time in over a week. When I woke up Wednesday morning, I thought maybe whatever had been happening was finally over.

Then I went to brush my teeth.

The bathroom mirror was fogged with condensation, which was weird because I hadn't showered. And someone had written something in the fog. One word, in my handwriting: ""Soon.""

But the really disturbing part was that the message was written from the inside of the mirror. Like someone standing behind the glass had written it backwards so I could read it correctly from my side.

I wiped it away and convinced myself I was seeing things. Stress hallucination. Lack of sleep. Something logical.

Then I checked my phone and found a text message I didn't remember sending. Sent to my own number at 4:33 AM. It said: ""Practice session went well tonight. You're a good teacher. See you soon.""

The message showed as coming from my number, but I didn't send it. I was asleep at 4:33 AM.

I called my phone company. They said the message definitely originated from my device. No one else could have sent it from my number. When I asked if there was any way someone could clone my phone, they said it was technically possible but extremely difficult and illegal and why was I asking?

I couldn't give them a good answer.

Wednesday night I didn't even try to sleep in the house. I packed a bag and drove to a motel on the other side of town. Left all my devices at home—phone, laptop, everything. If someone was somehow using my electronics to mess with me, removing myself from the equation seemed like the smart move.

I paid cash for the room, didn't give them my real name. No way for anyone to track me.

At 3 AM, I woke up to someone knocking on the motel room door.

Not pounding. Just gentle, polite knocking. The kind you'd do if you didn't want to disturb other guests.

I looked through the peephole and saw myself. Standing in the hallway at 3 AM, looking exactly like me but wearing clothes I didn't recognize. He waved when he saw me looking.

""I know you're awake,"" he said, and it was my voice. ""We need to talk.""

I didn't open the door. I sat on the bed and waited for him to leave. But he didn't leave. He kept talking.

""You've been very helpful,"" he said. ""All those recordings. Your voice patterns, your breathing rhythms, your sleep habits. I've been practicing. Learning to be you.""

I called the police. Whispered into the phone that someone was impersonating me, threatening me. They said they'd send a unit.

""The police won't help,"" the other me said from the hallway. ""I'll just tell them I'm you. Which one of us do you think they'll believe?""

When the cops arrived twenty minutes later, no one was in the hallway. They checked the security cameras and said no one had been there all night except me. Must have been a dream, they said. Stress-induced nightmare. Happens more than you'd think.

But when I looked at the peephole again after they left, there was a small piece of paper taped to the outside of the door. In my handwriting: ""The motel cameras are very easy to edit. I'm getting good at this.""

I'm writing this Thursday morning. I've been awake for thirty-six hours straight. I'm scared to sleep because I don't know what happens when I'm unconscious. And I'm scared to go home because I think someone—something—is living there now.

I just tried calling my house phone from a payphone. Someone answered on the second ring.

""Hello,"" the voice said. My voice.

""Who is this?"" I asked.

""This is you,"" he said. ""The question is, who are you?""

I hung up.

I need to go back to the house. I need to see what's happening. But I keep thinking about what he said Tuesday night: ""I want what you have. Your life. It looks comfortable.""

What if he's not just mimicking me? What if he's replacing me?

I'm going to drive by the house first, just to see. I'll update when I can.

---

I shouldn't have gone back.

The house looked normal from the outside. My car was in the driveway, which was impossible because I was driving it. I parked across the street and watched for maybe an hour. The lights were on. I could see someone moving around inside.

Someone who looked exactly like me.

He was wearing my clothes, walking with my posture, doing normal household things. Washing dishes, watching TV, feeding the cat. Like he lived there. Like it was his house.

Then he saw me watching from the car. He came to the front window and waved. Smiled my smile. And he mouthed something I could read clearly: ""Thank you.""

Then he closed the blinds.

I called the police again. Told them someone had broken into my house and was impersonating me. They said they'd check it out.

I watched from the car as two officers went to the front door. The other me answered immediately, invited them in. They talked for maybe ten minutes, all very friendly. When they came back out, one of the cops walked over to my car.

""Sir, you need to move along,"" he said. ""The homeowner says you've been harassing him. Says you've been calling and bothering him for days, claiming to be him.""

""I am him,"" I said. ""Check my ID.""

I showed him my driver's license. He looked at it, then back at me, then at the house.

""Sir, I just talked to you inside. You showed me the same ID. Now you need to leave before we have to arrest you for stalking.""

The other me was watching from the window again. He held up his driver's license and pressed it against the glass. Same name, same photo, same address. Identical to mine.

That was six hours ago. I'm at a 24-hour diner now, trying to figure out what to do next. I called my job to tell them I wouldn't be in tomorrow. They said I'd already called an hour earlier to say the same thing.

I tried calling my bank to check on my accounts. They said I'd already called today and withdrawn everything. Cleaned out my checking and savings. The person who called knew all my security questions, my mother's maiden name, everything.

My credit cards have been canceled. My utilities shut off. My lease was terminated this afternoon. All done by phone, by someone who sounded exactly like me and knew all my personal information.

He's erasing me. Systematically removing me from my own life.

But here's what really scares me. I just figured out where all those recordings came from. All that audio of me sleeping, breathing, talking. It wasn't from a security camera at all.

I've been saying things in my sleep for weeks. Having conversations with someone while unconscious. Teaching him how to be me. My voice patterns, my speech rhythms, my personal details, everything he needed to know.

And I remember now, sort of. Fragments of those conversations. Being asked questions while I slept and answering them automatically. Like hypnosis. He's been training me to train him.

The security camera was never about catching an intruder. It was about making me think there was an intruder so I wouldn't question why I was so tired all the time, why I felt like I wasn't sleeping well. He needed me unconscious but not suspicious.

I don't know how long he's been here. In the house, in my life, learning to replace me. Maybe weeks. Maybe months.

The waitress here keeps looking at me strangely. She just came over and asked if I was okay, said I looked like I hadn't slept in days. I caught my reflection in the window and she's right. I look terrible. Hollow. Like something's been drained out of me.

But that's not what's bothering her, I think. She keeps glancing at the TV behind the counter. The local news is on. And I can see myself on the screen.

It's a missing person report. My photo, my name, my description. The reporter is saying I disappeared three days ago under mysterious circumstances. My family is concerned. There's a reward for information.

The other me is on camera too, being interviewed. Crying. Begging for my safe return. He's talking about how worried he is about his twin brother—his identical twin brother who's been struggling with mental health issues.

I don't have a twin brother.

But apparently I do now. And he's the one people believe. He's the one with my house, my life, my identity.

The waitress is reaching for the phone. She recognizes me from the news report. She thinks I'm the missing person, and she's right. But she's going to call the police, and when they come, they'll take me to my ""brother.""

The brother who's been stealing my life piece by piece while I slept.

I'm leaving now. I don't know where I'll go. I can't use my cards, can't access my accounts, can't prove who I am. The person with all my identification and all my proof of identity is living in my house, and everyone believes he's the real me.

If you see this, if you read this, remember that I existed. Remember that I was real. Because I think very soon, I won't be anymore.

And if you live alone, if you have security cameras, if you start getting strange alerts...

Don't dismiss them as glitches. Don't assume you're safe just because you're alone.

Sometimes the person you need to be afraid of is yourself.

The other version. The one who's been watching you sleep and learning how to be you better than you are.",1,1758887189.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

Ciara 

I looked around the men's boutique shop, my eyes scanning for the perfect gift for my husband; Ryan as it was our 1st anniversary. 

Picking up the brown tie that caught my eye, a smile spread across my face. The shop attendant could see that I was pleased. 

""I guess this is the one you are going with?"" she questioned; pleased on her part that she'd finally satisfied me. 

""Yes, please""

""Then, let me wrap it up for you?""

I handed the tie over to her, ""Thank you""

Whilst the attendant wrapped my gift for Ryan, I couldn't help but remember how we'd first met. It was in a hospital; the same day I'd lost my parents in a car accident. 

Ryan happened to have also been involved in a car accident. One thing led to another, I began curious to know the cause of his accidents I'd started working in his house as his caregiver before I knew what was happening next, I was signing a form for a contract marriage with him. 

It seemed like a good idea because Ryan seemed like a good guy to me at that time and truthfully, I have never regretted being married to him. 

Ryan treats me with respect, way more than I deserved even though our marriage was by name only so this tie I was getting him for our first anniversary didn't even come close for all he's done for me. 

""Here you go"" The shop attendant said handing me a disposable bag. 

Taking the bag from her hand; I say with a smile, ""Thank you""

As I leave the boutique, I send a quick text to Ryan; ""I'll be at the coffee shop shortly"" it read.

""Take your time"" came his reply but I was giddy as I couldn't contain my happiness. 

Climbing into my car, I gently placed the disposable bag at the back of the car seat before taking off. 

While humming to my favourite song over the radio, I wondered if today would be a good day to make my feelings known to Ryan. 

""You can't be married for over a year without any feelings involved"" I muttered under my breath but was still highly conflicted, ""But what if my confession drives him away? That's the last thing I want to happen right now""

I shake my head, dissing the thought. ""Let's hold back for one more day. You are married to him, Ciara. You can always tell him about your feelings tomorrow""

As the coffee shop we were supposed to meet up in; CARLA'S M came to sight, I shook off the last surge of tension that coursed through my veins as I packed my car in the parking lot before lighting down with the disposable bag in my hands. 

Pushing the front door of the coffee shop open, I walked in; my eyes searching frantically for Ryan when suddenly my gaze landed on him. 

He was looking at his phone with a worried expression written all over his face. He was claded in a brown suit, his brown hair was neatly styled to the back. 

I gawked so hard at this fantasy man in front of me and didn't snap out of it until my phone rang. 

Ryan's eyes met mine and immediately, he rushed up to meet me, ""Why didn't you let me know you were here already? I was worried sick""

I smiled shyly, ""I'm sorry""

""Follow me"" Ryan led me to our table where he signaled for the waiter, ""We'll have it now""

""You already ordered?"" I asked Ryan when the waiter was gone. 

""You like taking hot coffee after a long drive""

This. This little gestures of Ryan, him remembering what I liked and what I didn't like despite us being in a contract marriage, made me fall in love with him. 

On his part it could just be that he was being 'kind' or being a 'nice' guy, maybe it was just me reading too much into his actions, I don't know. 

But these feelings of mine, I was ready to keep to myself until Ryan was ready to take the next step with me. 

""That's right, I got you something"" We say in unison as I couldn't help but blush at the fact that he remembered what today was.

""You go first"" I say shyly as Ryan brought out a brown envelope from within his bag and handed it over to me. 

""What is this?"" I questioned nervously. 

Ryan flashed me an encouraging smile, ""Don't be nervous. Go ahead and open it""

I took that as a sign; A good sign that whatever was inside this brown envelope was something I'd like. 

It made me more certain about my feeling for Ryan. Today, I thought. I was going to tell him about my feelings for him today. 

This envelope, this gift of his to me had only proven that Ryan felt the same way as me and that conclusion made my hands tremble as I opened the envelope. 

My eyes met Ryan's once more as I saw a paper inside the brown envelope. 

""Continue"" Ryan encouraged and I did. I brought out the paper that was buried inside the envelope and read it's content. 

No sooner had I been able to digest the information from the piece of paper, did it fall from my hands. 

My whole body began to quiver as I looked up at Ryan who wore a smug or was it? I couldn't tell as my vision was blurred with tears.

""What is the meaning of this?"" I questioned still in disbelief. Where had it all gone wrong? We were happy, he respected me and so did I…I even fell in love with him so how could he do this to me?!. 

""It's exactly what it says in the paper, Ciara""

""And what is that?"" I stubbornly inquired. It was as if I didn't want to believe what the paper read until Ryan says it with his own mouth. 

A part of me still wanted to fight for whatever we still have left; still wanted to protect our marriage. 

But then he'd said it. Ryan had uttered those words I so desperately dreaded,""I want a divorce, Ciara""

Chapter 2: PLEASE, LET MY MAN GO
Ciara
The feeling is quite describable. It was as if one minute I was flying up in the sky and the next minute, I landed hard on the ground without knowing why.
But if it was going to end this way, I needed to know why; I deserved that much courtesy.
""W-Why?"" I inquired with a shaky voice, bringing my hands to dab away at the tears that rolled down my cheeks; I wasn't going to let others watch me cry. Never.
While I was on the verge of a mental breakdown, it iriked me that Ryan; my instigator seemed to be doing just fine.
Ryan shrugged his shoulders, ""Do I need a reason to file for a divorce?""
I clenched my fist stop hard underneath the table; if not, I would have slapped him hard across the face.
""You need a reason if you want me to sign these papers"", I counterattacked. Not that I was going to sign it anyways.
Ryan reclined his back against the chair as he heaved a heavy sigh, ""Let's see. Where do I start from? You are a bad cook, bad when it comes to our personal hygiene. I mean, last time I came home I saw my sock on the kitchen sink. Who does that?""
I tightened my fist, ""It was just that one time and I'd gone on a business trip. Couldn't you take care of that yourself?""
Ryan shook his head; disgusted, ""No. If I could do that myself, why would I have married you?""
I felt my heart fall to my stomach. This man didn't really understand the amount of hurt his words were causing me, ""Then why did you marry me? Did I beg you? No, you are the one who brought up the idea in the first place so why am I suddenly the bad person!?""
""I don't know, you just are!"" Ryan counterattacked,""So back to my reasons…""
""Enough. I've heard enough""
""Wait, this is a really good one. Here it goes.."" Ryan paused,""The king reason for our divorce is most especially for this. You are terrible in bed""
His last words cut me deep like a knife. I let out an exasperated short laugh as I remembered those moments when Ryan would tell me he loves me or peck me softly on the cheeks.
I should have known better than to let myself believe that he was actually in love with me.
The corners of my lips lit up, ""Are you sure I'm the one who is terrible in bed? Last time we checked, you're the one who couldn't get IT up""
Ryan banged his fist on the table; angry, ""Hey!""
""What?!"" I shouted, not caring if we were attracting the crowd, ""Are you the only one who gets to say harsh words? Can't I share my own thoughts?""
I wave the paper Infront of him,""I won't be signing these divorce papers""
I moved to stand up from my seat but Ryan held me back, ""Hey, are you really going to be this way? Why won't you sign the papers? Why?!"" Ryan let out an heavy sigh; he was clearly frustrated, ""Do you want to destroy my happiness?!""
Dear lord, this is way too much for me to handle, ""I'm destroying your happiness?
""Of course!""
""Please can you two take this outside!?"" A customer yelled.
""Exactly!""
""And you ma'am, just sign those papers. Must you be with someone like him?!""
""You can do so much better in my opinion!""
I dabbed at my cheeks as I bowed down; apologizing to the customers, ""I sincerely apologize for ruining your day, everyone""
With that said, I bolted out of the coffee shop; hailing the first taxi that stopped Infront of me and heading straight home.
What a way to remember our first anniversary! And to think I'd bought him a tie!?. Frustrated to the peek, I threw the disposable bag; which housed the tie out the taxi window as I silently sobbed till I got to my destination.
When I'd gotten home, I'd payed the taxi driver whilst dragging my feet to the house front gate.
Memories of when we'd first arrived here threatened to pass through my head; I couldn't help it either.
I'd shared a whole lifetime of mine with this man. Everywhere I went, anything I bought were all bound to remind me of him.
It was going to be hard for me to accept this fact that Ryan was repulsed by me all along but most especially, it was going to be hard for me to move on.
""There has to be something more to this"" I muttered under my breathe, ""Was he being threatened or to do this or…""
I shake my head; clearing the thought off as soon as possible. I couldn't believe that Ryan had hurt me this evening more times than I could count but yet, here I was; Still worried about him.
""Madam.."" A young lady called out to me, approaching me. She was dressed in a yellow long sleeve top and a red skirt just a little bit above her knees.
There was a sling bag over her shoulders. She looked quite familiar…where had I seen her before?.
""Me?""
""Yes, you. Who else would I be speaking to?"" She questioned in a harsh, strong tone; one I didn't like and didn't have the time to tolerate as my world was crashing beneath my feet this evening.
I crossed my arms; ready for a fight, ""Who are you?""
The lady infront of me shoved her phone into my face; relieving pictures of her and my husband, sorry scratch that; Ryan being all lovey dovey together; Sharing kisses, feeding eachother, going to karaokes.
I couldn't seem to understand what was going on this evening; I'd obviously taking more than I could chew so when does it end!?
""Who am I, you asked?"" The lady questioned, ""I'm Ryan's girlfriend. I came to you to ask you for just one favor""
She held my hands as if her life depended on it, ""Please, let my man go""

Chapter 3: SEE YOU IN COURT
Ciara
It felt as if I'd just be hit over by a brick; or was it something worse? I don't know. All I knew was that right now..right Infront of me was proof that my husband has been cheating on me all along.
""Aren't you going to say something? Cat's got your tongue?"" The lady, Anne Infront of me questioned furiously.
It was such a shame that she thought I was the one who stole something from her and not the other way around.
I scoffed absentmindedly muttering under my breath,""So Ryan even kept me a secret all the while from the women he played with?""
""What did you say?""
Shaking my head; I voiced out aloud, ""I've heard you so for now, can you please go?""
I had a lot to deal with already and I'd clearly decided that I've had enough for one day so with that said, I'd turned away from her heading into the house but Anne had grabbed my wrist; holding me back, ""Hey, I'm not done yet!""
There and then, I lost my cool. All my pent up frustration and anger I'd bottled up all evening finally exploded.
""Please!"" I shouted breaking down into tears, ""Please, just go""
Shaking her wrist off me, I head into the house; slamming the door shut as I crumbled down to the ground, wailing in my own sorrow and misery.
Why was this happening to me? Why?. Placing my hands over my mouth, I tried to stiffle my tears but the more I tried, the more my tears flowed.
As I struggled to get back on my feet, I decides that I've had enough. Enough of Ryan, enough of this house, enough of everything.
Making my way to what used to be our bedroom, I brought out my traveling box from ontop the wardrobe.
Flinging the wardrobe wide open, I threw my clothes into the box in a frenzy with teary eyes.
This. This was going to be the last time anyone hurt me this way again. I swear it.
While packing up my belongings, I heard the main door open but didn't even bother to look in it's direction because was certain that it was no other than Ryan.
""Are you finally leaving?"" Ryan questioned with a mocking tone.
Just when I decided to spare him a glance, I saw 'her' beside him. I scoffed. So he was going as far as bringing her into our house now?.
Shaking my head, I diverted my gaze away from them; dragging my box closer to my drawer as I threw my jewelleries in.
Ryan held my hand as if stopping me but his gesture only iriked me.
""Would you let go off me!""
""I don't want to touch you either but where do you think you are taking those jewelleries to?. I was the one who bought them for you!""
I laughed. For the first time since the events of this disastrous evening played out, I had a good laugh.
""You bought it for me?"" I questioned, ""Don't be absurd. You didn't even buy me a single flower talkless of these jewelleries"" I free myself from his grasp as I continued with what I was doing.
When I was all packed up, I angrily threw the divorce paper that had been in my hands all evening on the reading table and scribbled my signature across it.
""Aren't you being too absurd?"" Anne questioned with irritation all over her face.
It took every bit of self control in my body for me not to hit her. She's the one who had ruined our one year of marriage, what seemed to be the perfect marriage I could ever imagine.
What right did she have to be irritated?!.
""I mean.."" Anne dragged out regardless, ""You two weren't even in a real marriage""
I knew it. She knew Ryan was married. Afterall, why wouldn't she? She was the reason behind Ryan and I's contractual marriage.
Whilst I'd worked as a caregiver for Ryan, his mother had forced him into getting married with Anne but he didn't want to and rather we'd gotten married.
Now seeing Ryan with the girl he'd used me for did kind of sting.
Anne scoffed, ""Don't tell me you actually fell in love with Ryan now, did you?""
I did and trust me, I regret every single moment of it, ""No, why would I? Ryan isn't actually someone who deserves love. Isn't that why you are with him?""
""Hey!""
""Listen to me good and listen well. Just because Ryan and I just got divorced because of you doesn't mean he actually loves you. He cheated on me despite being in a fake relationship as you've said so can you imagine what's going to happen to you?""
Ryan pushed me backwards,""Hey, if you are done packing your things then hurry up and leave. I won't tolerate you talking down at me in my own house""
""In your own house?"" I inquired gazing around the house I'd built with my hard earned money and sweat,""The whole plot of land, the house, 1.3billion dollars, the cars…""
""Hey, what are you saying?"" Ryan stuttered.
""What? Are you scared? Or is it now you remember that you didn't contribute a dime into our marriage? Don't worry, you won't be penniless. You and your girlfriend can feed and grow on your 'love' daily""
""And to be honest, you are quite well off too. Your company is doing well for the now so, remember all I said before? That's just a tip of the iceberg on the divorce alimony""
I pressed his shoulder down as I whispered into his ears, ""So honey, make sure to come with a good lawyer and try to fight me for all the things you didn't work hard for. I'll be waiting""
I bowed at Anne, ""I wish you two a happy married life or whatever you want to do yourselves""
Turning back to face Ryan, I flashed him a sweet smile. A smile of victory because I was finally convinced that even if I was going down, I wasn't going down in shame.
Slapping the divorce papers against his chest; I say through gritted teeths, ""See you in court""
Chapter 4: HER MILLION QUESTIONS!
Ryan
As I watched Ciara walk away from me; from our home, my blood began to boil.
Turning to face Anne; I spat out, ""Why did you come here?""
Anne scoffed, ""Babe, you can't actually be angry with me right now, can you? She is the one who didn't know her place. I was setting things right!""

I’ve been seriously considering starting a food-related business, but I’m stuck between two routes: going all-in with a small café or starting smaller with a cloud kitchen. Since this would be my first venture, I’d love some perspective from people who’ve done it or know the ins and outs of the industry here.

Options I’m weighing:

1. Open a small café in Maskan/Johar/PECHS/Bahadurabad – focusing on coffee, cookies, cakes, and a cozy vibe. This would eat up most of my savings but it’s something I’ve always wanted to try.

2. Open a small burger joint – mainly beef smash burgers and loaded fries. I feel like the demand is still there, but the competition is tough.

3. Start with a cloud kitchen (probably the more beginner-friendly option) – partner with Foodpanda/other apps for visibility and focus on specific products. Could either go the homemade desi cuisine route (biryani, karahi, pulao, BBQ) or keep it niche with pastas and maybe add lasagna later.

I have a budget of around 1M-1.5M PKR, no prior food business experience, and want to make the smartest move possible.

For anyone who’s been in this space:

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I have seen their posts multiple times na sa iba't-ibang job hiring for graphic designer and I am always wondering bakit naka anonymous ang post tapos paiba-iba pa sila design styles sa posting na way too different sa last ""hiring"" posts nila. So naging suspicious talaga ako so I tried applying, within minutes lang nagreply agad sila sending a google docs consisting of their ""Design Test"" (see the photos provided). Pagkakita ko pa lang nga nung first task duda na agad ako, lalo pa nung nagscroll na ko. Pinakamatindi pa yung requirement na isubmit in editable file at high quality pdf.

Because of that I decided to search if may nageexist ba talagang ganoong brand, lo and behold, meron nga and it looks like a startup coffee brand based on AU. Ang lala lang ng kung sino man ang graphic designer nila or if meron man. Imagine if people desperate enough to get a job actually undergo to their ""design test"" tapos nanakawin lang yung gawa nila. Grabe. OR baka naman may hired graphic designer sila kaso tamad at gusto libreng design project galing sa mga gusto magka trabaho. Nakaka diri and it's too much disrespect. To all Graphic Designers who are currently applying for a job online, wala pong ganitong mga pa design test or if meron man there will be no requirements for an editable files and high quality pdf file, yung iba nga they will encourage you pa to put watermark to all of your outputs.

You know how I used to always complain that my morning coffee tasted a bit like punishment? I thought I just had to accept that bitter, over-extracted taste as part of the deal. I even tried adding more sugar, but that just made it sweet and bitter, which wasn't the improvement I was hoping for.



My turning point was realizing the paper filter in my drip machine was actually part of the problem. It traps all the coffee's natural oils, which sounds good, but those oils are where a lot of the smooth, rich flavors live. Without them, you're mostly left with the harsher compounds. A friend finally introduced me to the French press, and it was a revelation.



The magic is in that metal mesh filter. It lets those delicious oils pass right through into your cup. The result is a coffee that feels fuller and smoother on your tongue, with a natural sweetness that really cuts the bitterness. The best part is the control; you decide how long it steeps, so if you want less bitterness, you just brew it for a shorter time. It’s incredibly simple.



Here's the fun part I learned: that layer of foam on top of a freshly pressed cup? That's called the crema, and it's made up of those very oils and tiny coffee particles. It acts like a little lid, trapping the aromas underneath. So when you lift the press and finally pour, you get this incredible wave of scent right before your first sip. It makes the whole process feel a bit like a tiny, daily ritual instead of just a caffeine grab. My mornings have genuinely gotten better since I made the switch.

I am a huge fan of ""Coffee Can Investing."" Just putting the money and forgetting about it. Obviously, before the buying, there's a long deliberation on the next 10 year future of the sector, of the company, PESTEL, etc. My analysis is more from business side than pure finance. 

But once the stock is picked, then I block all the noise. I maybe check on my investment maybe once a week or two, just to see what's up with each stock and if I've missed any major news that's making the sector/stock go up or down. That's all.

1nqyzjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nqyzjb/ro_a_cup_of_lingering_moments/,[RO] A Cup of Lingering Moments,"As I sit in the café, the air swells with the rich aroma of coffee beans, the steamy scent of freshly ground and brewed coffee. Millions of people inhale this fragrance every morning, yet most pay it no mind. Even the scent alone fills me with sensations—sweet, bitter, tender, and restless all at once.

I used to drink my coffee with just a splash of milk, but now I pour it generous and warm. Sometimes I add syrup or flavoring. I can never seem to get it just right—either it’s too sweet, or somehow still not enough. I have never been able to measure the good things properly. I long for perfection, for that elusive moment when my concoction feels truly complete. I can count on one hand the times my coffee has ever truly been perfect.

Here, the situation is different. I am not the one making it, and so I cannot ruin it. I won’t claim it’s better, but I settle for less and savor it all the same. I sip slowly, letting each mouthful linger, luxuriating in every instant. I do not understand those who knock back black coffee each morning, ignoring its pleasures. Yet, I suppose I understand—they drink not for joy but for habit, necessity. For me, a single cup can last hours, and if it finishes while I still long for more, I make another, which I may not finish until afternoon.

Part of this is because sweet coffee does not always sit well, while bitter I cannot drink at all. On these varnished wooden tables, no trace remains of how long someone has lingered—lost in conversation, thought, creation, or worry. A damp cloth erases it all, washing away every memory into the river of nothingness. There are no carvings here—people are civilized, they do not scratch a happy memory into wood.

Who knows what memory might return if someone sits here again, at this very table where they once etched names or dates? It would hurt, to see that a single wipe could erase nothing at all. Memories, like carvings, embed themselves into us with a permanence that defies simple erasure.

The chairs are not the most comfortable. One cannot sit for hours without consequence—legs go numb, the body begs to stand and walk, to coax circulation back. Sometimes, you do not notice the discomfort at all, if the circumstances are perfect. When you rise to leave, your legs tingle, your back aches slightly—but this is no pain. Merely a mild discomfort, and it brings a smile.

Some people come here every day, tolerating a numb body or weary soul. I wonder if that discomfort is still more bearable than the alternative: alone at home, sunk into a soft sofa, surrounded by anxieties, with dark, darting thoughts racing unchecked. I would rather sit with a sore bottom than wrestle with a mind in frenzy.

The lights cast a warm, yellow glow over the café, and the atmosphere feels like home. Here, it is soothing to pause, to think, because anything might jolt you from the spiraling thoughts you chase. Spoons clink against cups, glasses tap greetings, murmured sounds ripple from table to table—tones, timbre, fragments of words reach me. My mind cannot afford to dwell on its own thoughts; I must listen, track the origin, the journey of each sound.

Even outside these walls, the sounds pull me back. I must constantly hear something, anything, to keep from hearing the storm inside me. That storm is not merely noise—it is a tumult, a creaking, ancient train racing from my head to my heart, stuttering into pause only to pound again. The rhythm is uneven, loud, insistent, vibrating through my neck, my temples.

When something interrupts the noise, it travels toward my feet, and then, in a small pause, it swells again, thundering until it rests once more in my chest.

1nqyxwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/EssendonFC/comments/1nqyxwb/brick_by_brick/,Brick by brick,"I was born in 1993, just months after the Baby Bombers premiership. My dad, Essendon obsessed to his core, had seen the red and black win a flag and then, within eight weeks, held his first son in his arms. There’s a photo of me at two days old, wearing a tiny black-and-red beanie. You could say I never really had a choice in the matter.

As soon as I was old enough to understand the game, Dad signed me up as a member. We went to games religiously. His best mate, also an Essendon tragic, would come too, bringing his kids along. It became more than just football; it was family. That bond ran so deep that years later, his son stood beside me as best man at my wedding.

The seasons blurred together: 2008… 2009… 2010… 2011… Each year ended in disappointment, but Dad’s post-match mantra never changed. After the last siren of 2012, I remember standing with him on an overcrowded Frankston line train. Seventeen, frustrated, I asked, “Will we ever be good?” He just smiled, hugged me, and said, “There’s always next year.”

Around that time, I got a letter from the club: The Flight Plan. Essendon wanted to build the best training facility in the land and asked supporters to help fund it. I was ridiculously excited at the thought of having a literal brick with my name engraved, permanently set in Essendon history. I donated, even though I knew I’d rarely have reason to trek to Tullamarine.

When Jobe Watson won the 2012 Brownlow Medal, it was the proudest I’d ever been as a supporter. It felt right, the son of Tim Watson carrying the weight of the club on his shoulders and finally being rewarded.

And then came the supplements saga. Like so many Essendon fans, my world turned upside down. I don’t need to spell it out; we all know the damage. For my dad, it broke something permanent. In 2015 we let our memberships lapse, not out of anger but because the passion had drained away. Dad’s mate still tried to rally us for games, but even he couldn’t get his own kids back on board. His son and daughter, once little Bombers alongside us, now carry almost no red and black identity. And Jobe returning the Brownlow? That gutted me more than I can put into words.

The years rolled on: 2016… 2017… 2018… 2019… I drifted from football. I’d flick on the odd game and see a team of strangers in red and black. Players I didn’t know. Names I didn’t recognise. The club felt foreign.

Weirdly, it was the COVID lockdowns that pulled me back in. With the world at a standstill, professional sport became one of the few things to cling to. I learned the list again. I invested my time. I cared.

In 2022 I finally visited Tullamarine. I grabbed a coffee at the Jack Jones café, wandered through the museum, and read about the glory of 2000. That’s when I remembered my brick. Excited, I went to reception to ask where I could find it.

The reply? “Those bricks were taken down to make way for improvements. We know they’re important to members, but we don’t have a timeline for reinstating them.”

I chuckled, but it hit me. That little, insignificant brick has become the perfect metaphor for my journey as an Essendon supporter. The club will always have my brick. But they still haven’t decided whether it matters enough to put back into a wall - or leave it in a dark storeroom for the foreseeable future.

Now, I have a son of my own. There’s a photo of him, just days old, in an Essendon beanie - a mirror of my own baby picture. Neither of us are members right now, but I hold onto one hope: that one day, I’ll sit in the stands with him, like I did with Dad, and we’ll watch the Bombers in the first truly successful era this club has had in over 20 years.

Until then, I’ll sing the Essendon theme song to my son during play time. And maybe, just maybe, I’ll get to see my brick again.",26,1758886472.0,EssendonFC,2,0.93,False

**Parse the Odds**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard math. Beijing FC is the 7-time champion of the Chinese Super League, and the numbers back it up. Their implied probability of winning this match? A robust **68-70%**, based on decimal odds of 1.43-1.51. That’s like being 90% sure your microwave will heat your coffee—statistically sound, unless it’s a 20-year-old appliance with a death wish. Dalian Yingbo? They’re the underdog here, with implied odds of **15-18%** (decimal 5.2-6.0). To put that in perspective, it’s about as likely as me convincing my cat to wear a football jersey. The draw? A **20-22%** chance, which is roughly the probability I’ll remember to water my plants before I leave for the FA Cup final.

The spread tells a similar story: Beijing FC is favored by **1.25 goals**, with most bookmakers expecting them to win comfortably enough to not gift Dalian Yingbo a “moral victory” (i.e., a 1-0 loss that fans spin as “almost winning”). The total goals line sits at **3.0-3.5**, with “Under” priced slightly better. Given Beijing’s recent defensive struggles (see: Qinghai Kunlun’s late-corner “绝杀” that left defenders looking like they’d forgotten how to count to three), this might be a trap. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

**Digest the News**  
Now, the human drama. Beijing FC’s coach, Marcelo Setien, is currently the subject of a fan revolt dubbed the “倒塞派” (pro-ousting Setien faction). Three straight losses have fans howling for his head, but the club remains steadfast, clinging to the hope that he’ll magically rediscover his “tiki-taka in a Beijing bakery” strategy for the FA Cup final. Meanwhile, Dalian Yingbo’s squad has no such dra

Since this would be my first venture, I’d love some perspective from people who’ve done it or know the ins and outs of the industry here.

Options I’m weighing:

1. Open a small café in Maskan/Johar/PECHS/Bahadurabad – focusing on coffee, cookies, cakes, and a cozy vibe. This would eat up most of my savings but it’s something I’ve always wanted to try.

2. Open a small burger joint – mainly beef smash burgers and loaded fries. I feel like the demand is still there, but the competition is tough.

3. Start with a cloud kitchen (probably the more beginner-friendly option) – partner with Foodpanda/other apps for visibility and focus on specific products. Could either go the homemade desi cuisine route (biryani, karahi, pulao, BBQ) or keep it niche with pastas and maybe add lasagna later.

I have a budget of around 1M-1.5M PKR, no prior food business experience, and want to make the smartest move possible.

1nqyv1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1nqyv1i/tulip_mania/,Tulip Mania,"If you've never heard the story of Tulip Mania, you should. Not sure if we can post links anymore, but if you just search ""tulip mania"" you'll get the Wikipedia page for it. There's also references to it in movies like `Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps`.

It's a story of how bubbles happen. A bubble happened with the dotcom boom, crypto, NFTs, and now AI. History repeats over and over and over and over. Why is this important? It's important because people tend to follow people and have no other reason besides someone else doing something so therefore I they will too. And this leads to history repeating.

The story goes like this:

>*Back in the early 1600s, the Dutch Republic went through what’s often called the first recorded financial bubble — Tulip Mania. Tulips had just arrived in Europe and quickly became a luxury item, especially rare varieties with unique color patterns. They were exotic, fashionable, and a status symbol.*

>*At first, tulips were just expensive flowers. But soon, people started speculating on the bulbs themselves. Contracts to buy tulips at a future date began trading like commodities. By late 1636, prices for some bulbs had reached absurd levels — certain rare ones sold for more than ten times what a skilled worker earned in a year.*

>*Then, in February 1637, the whole thing collapsed. Buyers stopped showing up to auctions, confidence evaporated, and suddenly nobody was willing to pay the outrageous prices anymore. People who had agreed to buy bulbs at sky-high rates were left holding worthless contracts, and many simply refused to pay. Courts often sided with them, which meant the losses were largely absorbed by speculators rather than spreading through the broader economy.*

Tulip Mania was held up as a cautionary tale of irrational exuberance — the first “bubble” story.

So, how can we apply this to Forex? You may see some people preferring a certain pair in a bull market because others do. If you have a mathematically sound reason for doing so that's fine. But, if it's only because someone else is doing it and they make it seem like they're buying 20 lambos a day because of one pair, then remember the story about tulips.

History winks at us because human nature doesn't change. It's only the details that do. People make fortunes trading boring coffee. And if you prefer trading oranges that's cool too, but the most successful people master one or two markets without chasing the craze du jour. Chasing the latest craze while not mastering anything never tends to go well as there will always be a new one and it will distract you from mastering any single market.",1,1758886212.0,Forex,1,1.0,False

Stand out piece was the Discord convo - the topic was opened and addressed. Atrioc started to get hmmmm... a little bit more than 'calm' about it, perhaps a little frustrated at the framing of the current discourse; Newsom: ""Got it."" Done. Moved on. To me, it's worth recognising that a politician engaging in anything warmer than cool discourse around Discord in the current political climate would likely be ... detrimental...?   

The ""First game you were obsessed with...,"" tries to positions Big A somewhere near the start of his journey. Glizzard Wizzard largely stymies it with ""Last chopper out of Nam,"" economic opportunities, then, ""I wasted my college on League..."" Newsom refutes it, ""Didn't waste it, you got a career,"" and later, ""Working for a chip company, one of the greatest companies in the world,"" later progressing to ""Nah you're an entrepreneur, a small business person.""   Newsom, despite our self-effacing GH's best efforts, puts Brandon into a frame that the broader demographic, his audience, will respect. Necessary for the conversation to be worthwhile. Also, funny as fuck to watch our favourite baldie squirm under the discomfort of direct, insistent praise from one of his personal heroes. 

I could go on, but ... looks it's a fucking masterclass of conversational manoeuvring. Well worth watching from the perspective of what Newsom needs and gets from Coffee Cow, and how he conversationally pushes him there. That being said, I take my hat off to Atrioc for having his message, presenting the talking points he is passionate and cares about, and pushing them on a politician's platform.

Hi everyone,

I’m a 41-year-old male (South African Standard Time — aligns well with Africa, Europe, and the Middle East) looking for someone to check in with regularly about healthy, intentional use of stimulants (e.g. coffee, prescribed meds, etc.) and the habits that go along with it.

For me, the focus isn’t about quitting, but about:

* Staying organized with timing and dosage.
* Building routines around breaks, rest, and recovery.
* Avoiding overuse or “sliding” into bad patterns.
* Encouraging healthier habits (sleep, exercise, food) alongside it.

I imagine short daily or every-few-days check-ins (text, DM, or even quick voice notes if that works). Ideally this would be a two-way thing — we’d keep each other honest, share wins/struggles, and help each other stay balanced.

[**https://petewentzisacreep.neocities.org/**](https://petewentzisacreep.neocities.org/) )

It's pretty much objectively true that pete dated a teenage girl when he was 25 who started out as an FOB fan, and was extremely emotionally and physically abusive to her (he was literally arrested for committing domestic violence against her) and apparently ruined her life for 5 years, then years after they broke up published a book about how much he hates her and wants her to die, and made most of his money off of lyrics about the same thing. He also was involved with and directly funded extremist groups that advocated for banning abortion and attacking, SAing, or killing gay people and feminists when he was like 22, and he's still friends with those people today. Yet, nobody in the fandom cares at all and they get extremely offended if you bring it up, more so than any fandom I've been in. Worse, lots of people downplay what he did or try to make Jeanae seem like she was in the wrong, which is so obviously cruel and inexcusable I almost can't believe it.

Some common things I hear include:

**""They were mutually toxic, he was actually the victim!""** She was 16 when they met and he was 23, they dated until she was 19 and he was like 27. Already gives him all the power in that relationship. Also, I've seen no convincing evidence she ever ""abused"" him, meanwhile the things he admitted and even bragged about doing to her are actually horrifying. Just imagine what she must have felt like back then. She was just a mentally ill teenage girl who, unfortunately, stumbled into the path of an even more mentally ill man who wanted to take his anger at the world out on everyone else, and apparently she felt like she had to make him happy which was obviously fighting a losing battle. He would publish shit constantly about how he's obsessed with the idea of her dying, and in interviews he'd call her crazy or brag about how he hurts himself while arguing with her. On top of all that, fans hated her and would frequently post their fantasies of gruesomely murdering her online. It's no wonder she completely lost it and became a homeless drug addict (congratulations to her for fixing her life by the way.) The only reason someone would say she's somehow in the wrong is if they're unhealthily obsessed with Pete or just don't care about the safety of young girls.

**""It was so long ago, let it go. He's changed.""** There's several problems with this. Young fans who don't know about this still idolize him and think he's a great guy. He built his image off of being accepting, pro-gay, pro-woman and all that, while doing things that directly contradict it that he's faced no consequences for. There's no reason to believe he's had some great moral awakening, he probably just got used to his comfortable rich life and isn't an emotionally volatile young man anymore, which doesn't mean he regrets his actions or has fundamentally changed as a person. He's also never taken any accountability for it nor have any of his friends who let this happen, and again, he got famous and rich off the lyrics he wrote about her. To me that's important and worth talking about. ALSO, he is far from innocent nowadays. Again, he still associates with the founders of extremist hate groups, and published a book with them a few years ago. FOB toured with hayley williams' abusive groomer ex husband years after that information was known about him. And there's even more I could list. To me it's obvious he's a scumbag. I understand a lot of people are emotionally invested in him and don't want to believe it but that's exactly why this conversation needs to be had.

**""What's he supposed to do?""** Nothing. I don't expect anything from him because abusive celebrities never address their pasts. Literally all I want is for the fanbase to not act like you dumped hot coffee on them every time you bring this up because it's a completely reasonable thing to be upset about. People have been completely ""cancelled"" for much less, and Pete's one of the cases where it would be completely deserved. Obviously, I don't think people should stop liking FOB or even Pete but I think it's beneficial to allow conversations about this stuff even though it's tiring.

**""I don't care about this, I just like the music.""** Good for you, must be a peaceful life.

Anyway, that's all I had to say, please don't be too mean to me.",0,1758885679.0,FallOutBoy,19,0.48,False
1nqyp40,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nqyp40,The Tough Coffee Bean: The Pros & Cons of Pursuing Zain from TDR ☕,"[LONG POST AHEAD! AND SOME SPOILERS!]

TLDR: Zain's path requires dedication. Take it if you are really invested in the character (and I guess, in the sprite?) 

Who would've thought that in my constant deliberations about pursuing Jack or Adil, I ended up choosing the cunning Zain Al-Abbas for my Yasmin (I named her Phrolova) 🐍🌹

This completed book was read meticulously with two windows of Wiki playthroughs open: one for Zain's profile and the other for the general walkthrough to ensure his 100% ☕ Was it anxiety inducing? Yes. Was it worth it? ABSOLUTELY.

📍Let's start with the cons, because why not?

1) Zain doesn't like sharing, so you really need to friendzone EVERYONE. Ignore all exclusive outfits and pick the most neutral answers when two characters fight. Though I wanted to check other paths, especially Cindy's (since she also helps you build a theory) and Jack's (his face card kills me every time!), I needed to ignore all choices that will lead to relationship improvements. As a result, S2 will automatically begin with most of the LIs treating you like a friend. But even when they treat you as friends, you still can't buy them the best clothes (as a fashion connoisseur, this hurts me deeply 😭).

2) The romance only builds up during S2, and it is mostly a push and pull romance. The age gap, relationship with Yasmin's father, and Zain's perspective on starting a family really adds to their dynamic. Not to mention that Zain will mention traditional beliefs on women, particularly about modesty. In real life, I don't appreciate those words, but I guess I can let it slide this time LMAO.

3) This is more of a preference, but they have a lot of cute moments together (e.g. Yasmin daring Zain to jump to the pool, Zain gifting Yasmin a dress and helping her put it on) but these scenes don't have a CG. Even their wedding doesn't have a CG.

📍Now for pros, because I wouldn't read this story if it weren't for the pros!

1) Zuleika is supportive of this relationship! I believe this is the only relationship she is immediately supportive of when you confess your romantic relations with an LI. She's even thankful that Yasmin chose Zain to be her husband.

2) You'll see Yasmin's father, Kadir, being protective of her when Zain confesses his plans on marrying Yasmin. I genuinely thought that Kadir will be supportive of them, but no. Kadir really loves his daughter and he doesn't want to associate her with someone close to the Salehs. Kadir even threatens to kill Zain if he puts her in harm.

3) He marries you chapters before the finale, so you'll have some time being husband and wife. I like how Yasmin tells Zain that she is ready to face her problems even if the truth hurts her, and Zain assures her that he sees Yasmin as a courageous woman. I appreciate that scene because it shows how Zain views Yasmin as his equal. 

4) Zain's character is explained more in his path. Zain has a tragic past related to his father, which influenced his perspective on starting a family. If you marry Zain, he will introduce you to his mother, and she loves Yasmin! 

5) The spicy scenes... I mean... They will speak for themselves once you read them. The CGs are also well done! I just wished that we got a spicy scene for Yasmin's intimate dance (iykyk) 🐍

📍Some things to consider:

1) My path was Rebellion+Desert Rose. It made the most sense to me because Rebellion allows you to spar with Zain verbally, while Desert Rose will ensure that Yasmin will still be politically involved in Sefer with Zain in the finale.

2) I didn't pursue the rebel romantically in my playthrough. I didn't keep the flower he gave, so I missed one important detail in the story. Regardless, I still got a happy ending and saved everyone!

3) I ignored Jaffar and Saeed like the plague, missing out on their possible romantic interactions.

4) I didn't pursue Adil. The story didn't mention Adil getting tortured even if I didn't take his diamond scene. An Adil+Zain love triangle also exists, but I have no plans on doing that 😭

5) I got the Hidden Rebel path, and it pushes Zain to warn Adil not to involve Yasmin in their plans. Adil reminds him that Yasmin is capable of choosing her own path (Thanks, Adil!).

So that's it! I might have missed some details, but these are the ones that stuck to me the most. TDR was difficult to play since you really need to be careful with the choices, plus you need to remember all the details about the plot, but Zain was so worth it for me 😭☕ I chose screenshots of my fave interactions, and I hope that you play his route to understand their context better ✨

1nqynwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1nqynwe/flies_are_gross_and_driving_me_crazy/,Flies are gross and driving me crazy,"Hi everyone, I've been a barista in a cafe on-campus as a private university for over a year now. I've dealt with plenty of insane issues (like being underpaid on random months, dealing with everything myself, catering unexpectedly for 30+ people at the same time as ding front of house duties - all alone! - and a massive drama where the cleaner basically harassed me for months) but this one is the last straw for me.

The aforementioned cleaner died of a heart attack a few weeks ago (I know!) and the replacement cleaner ironically has poor hygiene practices. They're hired by the school, not the campus, which is partly why the former cleaner wasn't fired despite causing a ton of issues with me and others. The new cleaner has caused a major FLY infestation by leaving a huge pile of garbage bags from around the school overnight for a week on campus, instead of throwing them away in the designated garbage room as he was instructed to do at the end of each day.

So we came in to work, and - I kid you not - inside this building that has limited windows that open - the ceiling was BLACK with flies in the corridor where he left the garbage. Now of course tons of black gross fat flies at buzzing around the cafe where I work alone ALL DAY!

It is indescribably GROSS and humiliating to stand there trying to serve the students while four or five black flies are endlessly buzzing around the cashier area and landing on cups, milk jugs, sandwiches (all covered in a box), the coffee dispenser, the espresso machine and basically on EVERYTHING. My boss told me he'd spotted fly excrement on the cups and surfaces so everything is contaminated.

  
We've killed so many of them every day, which is also terribly gross to do in front of customers and around food. It literally makes me nauseous. After 10 minutes of blissful fly-free moments MORE come out of nowhere?! I even wondered if squishing them just makes them spring back like jelly and fly around again after we've thrown them in the bin. Honestly it's VILE.

I'm on my last straw here. I want to quit! Should I wait and see if the staff will do anything? I suggested fly paper and they shrugged. The staff couldn't care less. Or should I walk out this weekend and say screw it.",2,1758885555.0,barista,2,1.0,False

We are considering buying a property which we really like, but the only downside is the kitchen surface area is smaller than our current place. We need somewhere to put a microwave, Ninja 2 drawer airfryer, Sage coffee machine and kettle, and also prep space. Unfortunately nothing can go on the other side as that is the entrace to the utility room. We are open to changing the kitchen up a bit to make it work but that would reflect on the price we pay for the property. We would need somewhere to put the airfryer with nothing above for ventilation so I guess one of the cupboard above would have to go.

Would love your thoughts and ideas please!

1nqykx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1nqykx6/the_only_productivity_advice_you_need/,The only productivity advice you need.,"I recently read ""Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals"" by Oliver Burkeman. The average human life is about 4,000 weeks long. As the remaining weeks on our 4,000-week calendar pass by, there's pressure to make the most of them. Each of our remaining weeks are like glass jars passing on a conveyor. If we fill each jar as it passes by, we feel like we're justifying our existence, but if we let too many pass by unfilled, we feel we've wasted them. We don't want to see partially filled jars go by, so we take on more responsibility than we can handle, and we think of a thousand cool things we want to do before we die.

Imagine all the tasks you have to complete to uphold your responsibilities at work and at home are like tiny pebbles piled up in the corner of your mental factory. And your bucket list items are like big rocks piled up in another corner of your mental factory. As you fill your time jars with pebbles and rocks, you live with a constant anxiety that you won't have enough time to do everything you need to do or want to do. Oliver Burkeman calls this existential overwhelm. If you try to eliminate existential overwhelm with better time management systems and efficiency hacks, you'll run into the efficiency trap. This is because the faster you clear the deck of things you need to do, like emails, tasks, and things to clean and organize, the faster your deck is filled with new things to do. If efficiency is your goal, you'll never achieve peace of mind and you'll always feel like you're playing catch-up. The anxiety from existential overwhelm, the frustration generated by the efficiency trap, and the pressure to fill your remaining weeks with activity makes your limited time on this planet unnecessarily stressful.

However, there's a way to eliminate existential overwhelm, avoid the efficiency trap, and enjoy your remaining weeks while living a productive life.

Several years ago, Warren Buffett was boarding his personal plane when his pilot asked him for goal-setting advice. Buffett told his pilot to make a list of 25 life goals and arrange them from the most important to the least. After the pilot thoughtfully organized his goals, Buffett said, ""Now throw out goals 6 through 25 and never do them under any circumstance"". Life is too short to let the moderately appealing goals in slots 6 through 25 distract you from completing the life-changing goals in slots 1 through 5.

Our modern world provides us with an inexhaustible supply of things that seem worth doing, which leads to a bottomless bucket list. The irony is that the more we want to do, the less we accomplish, because the more activities we have to choose from, the more we overthink, perpetually plan, and live in a continuous state of existential overwhelm.

If you want to eliminate existential overwhelm, create and maintain an open and closed life list. Start by capturing everything you wish to do someday on the open list. This might be businesses you want to start, skills you want to learn, and countries you want to visit. Now, move three to five goals over to the closed list and don't look at the open list again until you complete or forever abandon one of the goals on your closed list. It's good to have at least three goals on your closed list because there will be times you must wait for a decision or event before proceeding on one or more of your goals.

Once you move three to five items from your open list to your closed list, fully accept that you may never complete the items on your open list. After emotionally accepting that fact, your only concern in life is getting the three to five items off your closed list before you die.

When you have an open and closed list system, it's like you're getting a truck to come and take away most of the big rocks in your mental factory, and being left with a few rocks you know you can manage. After chipping away at a remaining rock and putting the entirety of the rock in your time jars, you can then call the truck driver back and select a new rock, instead of just having a bunch of rocks hanging around pulling at your psyche. The added bonus of having an open and closed list is that you're less likely to procrastinate because you know the only way that you make room for new and exciting activities is to get an item off your closed list and create a vacancy for a new goal.

Once you've started eliminating existential overwhelm, it's time to avoid the efficiency trap. The more efficiently you answer email, the more email you receive. The more efficiently you conduct meetings, the more meetings you'll be asked to lead. And the more efficiently you clean dishes, the more often you'll be put on dish duty. So, be careful what you choose to be efficient at. The more efficient you are at something, the more of that something you tend to do.

As a highly driven individual, you may want to be great at everything you do, but being great at low-value activities usually means a good portion of your 4,000 weeks will feel meaningless. Rather than doing everything excellently, practice **s**trategic underachievement. Identify all the low-return activities you must do to uphold your responsibilities at home and at work. Then, look at each of those activities and ask yourself: ""What is the absolute bare minimum I can do so I can make time for what matters most?""

Can you clean your house once a week and stop cleaning when you feel it's 80% clean and still feel satisfied? Can you cut the lawn half as frequently and still feel like you're managing your yard? Can you take twice as long to respond to email without angering anyone? You'll probably find that doing just enough and being ""good enough"" at most tasks will allow you to stay on top of your responsibilities and create time for what matters most. Your time is limited, so reduce your standards for most activities, make some trade-offs, and embrace strategic underachievement in most areas so you can spend most of your time being excellent in a select few areas. John Acuff, author of ""Finish,"" says, ""When you decide in advance what things you're going to bomb, you remove the sting of shame.""

Now that we've dealt with existential overwhelm and have a way to avoid efficiency traps, it's time to enrich your remaining weeks. The busier you get trying to fill your remaining weeks with activity, the faster life will pass you by. But you can subjectively slow down time, eliminate busyness, and savor your remaining weeks by embracing your finiteness and conducting last-time reflections.

You and I don't know when our life is going to end, so it's best that we assume that every experience is happening for the last time. This might sound gloomy on the surface, but when you experience each activity as if it's the last time you're going to experience it, you stop rushing from activity to activity and slow down your experience. When you treat a kiss with your partner like it's the last kiss you'll have, or a cup of coffee you're enjoying is the last cup of coffee you'll ever have, or the song you're listening to is the last time you get to enjoy music, you'll get lost in the moment and have a richer experience, and stop worrying about the passage of time.

Many of us assume that because we've done something a thousand times, we will do it a thousand times more, so everything feels routine and we stop paying attention to what we're doing. But if you stop taking things for granted and start assuming that everything you're doing, you're doing for the last time, even the most mundane experiences can be filled with beauty and enjoyment.

In the end, most time management systems create existential overwhelm, efficiency traps, and a never-ending sense of busyness, which leads to unnecessary stress and erodes what time we have left on this planet. But we can live happy and productive lives by embracing our finiteness and working with an open and closed list, embracing strategic underachievement to make time for what matters, and practicing last-time reflections.",1,1758885278.0,productivity,1,1.0,False

my main questions would be how long should i keep the soft food diet going? i currently have some sort of gum bandage pressed onto the area, its like a pale pink colour, should i wait until that’s fully gone to start trying other foods again?


next question, what am i allowed to drink? it said no coffee or tea which i understand, but then it says to drink water. am i strictly meant to drink water until im healed or are there other drinks (ie vitamin or electrolyte drinks) i could have?


final question!! should i continue taking the prescribed pain medication even if i don’t feel any pain now? it says to take 500mg Tylenol every 4-6 hours, but i don’t feel any pain at all so i haven’t taken any since last night. i figured it should be okay but i just wanna double check.

But take a look at Starbucks ($SBUX). For years, Starbucks has been like a little mirror of the U.S. economy—more people working = more daily coffee buyers.

Except… Starbucks is sliding. That doesn’t really add up if everything is so strong, right? If we really have record-breaking employment, shouldn’t $SBUX be printing money off all those workers grabbing lattes before their shifts?

And it’s not just Starbucks. We’re seeing the same thing with a lot of companies that rely on “everyday luxuries”:
	•	McDonald’s ($MCD) has been warning that low-income customers are pulling back on visits.
	•	Dollar General ($DG) is under pressure because even its core shoppers are struggling.
	•	Nike ($NKE) sales have slowed, especially in North America, as people cut out non-essentials.
	•	Target ($TGT) has talked about consumers trading down and focusing only on basics.

What this really shows is that the jobs numbers don’t tell the whole story. People might technically have jobs, but they don’t have the disposable income. A $5 coffee, a pair of sneakers, or a fast-food meal has turned into a “luxury.”

So yeah, you can call the economy “healthy” all you want, but consumer spending habits—and these stocks—say otherwise. The disconnect is real.

Money talks: A lot of stores just aren’t pulling in enough to cover high rent, labor, and operating costs.

Changing habits: Customers are feeling inflation and cutting back on $6 coffees. Home-brewing setups and local cafés are eating into Starbucks’ dominance.

Strategy shift: CEO Brian Niccol says the company wants to get back to basics. That means fewer but better stores  over 1,000 are getting facelifts ( uplifts ) in the next year.

Reshuffling resources: Closing weaker locations frees up cash to invest in stronger ones.

But here’s the messy part

Workers are caught in the middle. Starbucks says baristas at closing stores can transfer, but critics argue many will end up jobless.

Unions are watching closely. Starbucks has been fighting unionization efforts, and some are accusing the company of using closures to target organized stores (something Starbucks denies).

Reputation risk: Starbucks built its brand on being everywhere. Cutting hundreds of stores risks making it less convenient which could push people to competitors.

Big picture

This isn’t just about coffee. It’s about how big chains handle inflation, high overhead, and changing consumer habits. Starbucks is betting that fewer stores + remodeled locations = higher profits. But with $1B in restructuring costs and rising competition, it’s a risky gamble.

If the turnaround works, Starbucks could reinvent itself. If not, your neighborhood green siren might not be around much longer.

**Sloppy Trader** \- desk buried under coffee mugs, random notes, maybe even yesterday’s lunch box. Trading is rapid, chaotic, high-volume scalps. Mess everywhere, but somehow, money gets made.  
  
**Neat Trader** \- minimalist desk, dual monitors lined up, notebook open with perfect handwriting. Trading is patient, disciplined, sniper-like entries. Rarely many trades, but the ones taken matter.  
  
**Freelance Trader** \- laptop, headphones, hotspot. Could be in a café, airport, or Airbnb. Trading style? Flexible, opportunistic, adapting to whatever the environment gives. Risk: internet outage mid-trade (we’ve all seen the panic).  
  
The funny thing? There’s no “right” environment. We’ve watched traders succeed (and fail) in every single one. So it makes us wonder - **is the setup shaping the trader, or is the trader shaping the setup?**

I keep my bananas in my middle area under the radio. I arrived to the pick up and a black man got in my car…I said hello how are you today and he slowly said..I’m good..I said great..I confirmed where he was going and he said yes…about 2 minutes later he said “what’s up with those bananas.” I responded saying yeah gotta get my potassium in for the day. It’s my normal morning diet…oatmeal and bananas. He said..”well I find it weird that you so happen to have those out picking up a black person.”

I decided to pull over to the nearest gas station and advised him the ride is over. I told him that I don’t tolerate that behavior. 

Of course he played victim and said I was racist and he’s going to report me..I said that’s fine I have a dash cam that recorded the whole interaction.

But then I made a cappuccino with it, and it was a completely different story. With milk, it actually worked really well. Smooth, slightly sweet, almost like the coffee was made to be a supporting act instead of the main show.

The weird part is when I use the coffee machine or the air fryer, which are on the same breaker, it stops. It’s been very humid here in MA the past couple of days and our windows are open because electricity costs are overwhelming. Could humidity alone be enough to set these things off?

Little by little, the light returned to Daisy’s vision. She stood up in a delirious state, her vision still blurry, holding her throbbing head. But the smell of lush grass awakened her fully. As her sight stopped being blurry, she witnessed the homely Kansas prairie. However, to her shock, Mary appeared before her, looking stern.

""M-ma?""

“That’s me.”

Daisy scanned the prairie from left to right. “Are Belle and Aisha here, too?”

""You've got yourself in quite the mess, my wayward daughter. You've made promises to me, your sisters, and many others. And now you're on the verge of breaking them all.""

""I—""

""What did your father teach you about this matter?""

""W-when you make a rule for yourself or god, you follow it.” Daisy cried. “But I'm trying my hardest, ma, honest.""

Tears ran down Mary's face as she went to hug Daisy. ""I beg you to try harder. Please, get up and return to us, Daisy.""

“I—“

*“Please,”* Mary shouted.

“I will.”

Quickly, Daisy reciprocated, hugging her mother with all her strength. But the smell of ash soon filled the air, replacing the grass. She looked around the prairie and saw a great inferno wash across the landscape. The flames hurriedly grew bigger and bigger, consuming the Earth, like a pack of ravenous wolves. Until they pounced on her and Mary, devouring them in the blaze.

\*\*\*

Daisy awakened to the harsh reality. The young woman woke to find the chamber of darkhold, crumbling in fiery carnage as flames danced around the room. And amongst the ruin, she lay trapped under a massive piece of rubble.

""It was a dream.” Daisy panted. “But this is a nightmare.""

Daisy lifted the rubble, but as she tried to walk to the generator, a sharp pain in her side stopped her. And her eyes widened, face pale white as she saw the cause. A metal shard pierced her side, pinning her to the rubble.*""No.""* Her mind raced faster and faster, blurring her thoughts. However, all became clear as Morana appeared standing before her, smiling.

""Darling, I found the corpse.” Morana looked closer, realizing Daisy was still breathing with a groan. “Scratch that. She's still alive.""

Daisy saw her shield behind Morana and went to summon it. But as it started to move, Cymbeline stomped it, pinning it to the floor.

""Trying that same failed trick again, Damara? You're even more pathetic than that pile of ash, general,"" Cymbeline snickered.

As she heard Cymbeline, Morana began giggling. However, she quickly stopped, seeing Daisy's injury.

""By the emperor, you've been impaled. One wrong move could kill you.""

Swiftly growing a sinister grin, Morana punched Daisy in the stomach. Daisy coughed up blood from the attack, and Morana laughed at the top of her lungs from her suffering. But as she prepared for the killing blow, she stopped.

""Cymbeline my love, forgive me. You're the commander of this mission, so you should have the kill.""

""Please be my guest.""

""You do know how to treat a girl, Cymbeline."" Morana tittered

Morana made an ice knife, staring at Daisy with a grin beaming with malefic glee.

""There are so many ways to kill you I can hardly choose. But, I think I'll carve out your heart and hang your corpse in my mansion. So you may serve as a warning to others.""

Morana swiftly plunged the knife toward Daisy's heart. However, as the edge raced to its target, Daisy caught her hand. Morana tried to force it down, but no matter how much strength she poured into the attack, Daisy wouldn't move. And worse, Daisy crushed her hand, making her scream. Cymbeline readied to take action as he saw them. But before he could, the shield caught ablaze and flew towards Daisy.

*""It burned me?""* Cymbeline shouted.

The weapon flew back into Daisy's hand, splitting into the twin shields. And as she pulled herself off the metal shard, a terrible truth for the Nemesis became apparent. Even bloodied, bruised, and with a hole in her side, Daisy still possessed the strength to fight.

*""She's alone, injured, and outgunned. So why does she not yield?""* Morana thought.

Hastily, Daisy smacked Morana with her flaming shield, sending her flying across the room. Cymbeline, snarling like a wild beast, incarnated his intense flames around his body. And he charged at Daisy with his weapons.*""You die now.”* Meeting Daisy with fiery bloodlust. Her shields blocked his blades as they aimed for her vital spots. He slashed his weapons so fast it appeared like Daisy was guarding against forty opponents, pushing her back, he grew swifter still. However, one strike soon broke through her defenses and neared the kill.

*""Don't give up. Don't give up. Don't give up,""* Daisy said resolutely.

Cymbeline's blade closed on Daisy's windpipe. Still, as the tip neared her flesh, aid came. Carter, badly burned but alive, arrived with one-quarter of his upper body and half of his face covered in horrific second-degree burns. Pushing away the reaping hook with his sword, leaving Daisy with a tiny scratch.

*""Carter,""* Daisy shouted joyfully.

*""You live?""* Cymbeline snarled.

""You're damn right, I do.""

""But how? I set you ablaze, falling miles in the air.""

""You're right, and I thought I was a goner, too. But good thing the horse caught me in time.""

""What?"" Cymbeline asked.

Cymbeline heard Flaremane above his head, neighing. He followed the sound to see the stallion through a hole in the ceiling. And, fuming, he tossed a large piece of rubble at him. However, Flaremane flew away, evading his wrath.

""Now come on. There's no need to act like a child just because we’ll win,"" Carter said jokingly.

*""Don't make me laugh,""* Cymbeline screamed.

Cymbeline sent another fire tornado at the couple. But this time, Carter stood ready to meet the attack. He swiftly sent a flurry of energy slashes from his sword. They met the tornado in a massive explosion, butchering it. And as it subsided, he dashed towards Cymbeline at blistering speed. Cymbeline unleashed a salvo of fireballs at Carter. Still, he dodged the barrage to meet his adversary, their blades collided with a vengeance as Carter thrust them across the room.

They furiously swung their blades against each other. Together, the two screamed louder and louder, signaling their increasing effort. Devoted to the other's destruction, they matched blows with relentless drive. Their slashes grew swifter and swifter with each attempt to slay the opponent, becoming a blur in the vast glimmer of their blades, circling one another in a dance of death.

Morana regained her senses to see Carter and Cymbeline. ""I'm ending this."" Quickly, Morana prepared her death beam. But Daisy jumped to her, ramming her into the far wall. And as she aimed to shoot Daisy, Daisy hit her with a headbutt, knocking her unconscious.

Swiftly, the duel between the men neared its end. With one final slash, focusing the heat of his flames through his blade, Cymbeline cut Carter's sword in two. As he took a second to laugh, Carter retaliated with a punch to his face, tackling him into a wall. However, Cymbeline blasted him away and prepared for the kill as Carter lay helpless. Still, as he was about to fire, Daisy jumped between them, tossing Morana at Cymbeline. 

*""Enough,""* Daisy said.

Cymbeline launched a titanic fireball at the couple. But as it approached them, Daisy stood fearless. With her shield, she deflected the blast toward the generator, hitting it.

*""No,""* Cymbeline shouted.

""Yes,"" Daisy said.

The generator exploded. Daisy and Cymbeline rushed to protect their lovers from the blaze. And the chamber was swiftly consumed in the colossal inferno. As it subsided, Daisy dropped her giant shield to the floor and she hit it face-first with her body going limp. Absorbing the concussive blast of the explosion depleted her strength. However, as she heard pained groans from close by, she turned her head to look. Carter crawled to her aid, using all his remaining energy, dragging his body across the floor with his last good arm. 

Daisy smiled at her beloved. ""One down. Now to Clive's.""

Carter forced a smile. ""And let's hope this time we get a challenge.""

Despite the pain in her chest, Carter's words made Daisy laugh, but she quickly stopped.

""Seriously, do you have enough fight left for this?""

""I guess we'll find out.""

Flaremane flew to them, inviting the couple to come on his back. And helping each other up, they happily accepted. As they left, a pillar of fire rose from a pile of rubble. It revealed Cymbeline with Morana unconscious in his arms. But seeing his beloved hurt and his fortress crumbling around him, he hurried to one final recourse against the enemy.

\*\*\*

The staff rushed to move the patients to safety at the infirmary in the United Planets base. But amongst the chaos, little by little, Lucas's eyes started to open. And as he regained consciousness, still only half awake, his thoughts poured out.

""Sarah?"" Lucas asked in a whisper.

\*\*\*

Meanwhile, at the fortress, Daisy and Carter flew through the air. They saw the buildings where the other generators were held were in flaming ruins.

""Do you think Hydromos did this?"" Carter asked.

Unanticipatedly, Daisy's communicator rang, and she answered it.

*""Damara, General Carter, what is your status?""* Favian asked over the communicator.

""Oh, good, General Favian. We were wondering if you handled Clive's generator?""

""No, me and Ros handled it. And I guess Yara helped a little too.""

Carter hastily took the communicator from Daisy. *""Clive, brother, I thought you were dead.""*

""I'm not going anywhere, Carter.""

Carter released a deluge of happy tears, hearing his friend. But he swiftly stopped, red-faced, seeing Daisy smiling at him. However, Daisy pulled him close, kissing him with passion.

""We win,"" Daisy said.

On the other side of the fortress, Cymbeline neared his recourse. He staggered to a balcony, fighting to stay conscious. Still, as he started to go under, he clung to the waking world, calling upon his hatred, and reached his destination, the targeting system he used to shoot Lucas out of the sky. Cymbeline typed on a holographic control panel and again summoned it. And using the darkest of powers, Cymbeline committed one final act of revenge. From his hands, a fireball of approximately five thousand meters in diameter of black flames came forth, endowed with all his hate, and with the system, he sent it hurtling to its victims.

\*\*\*

The fireball left the fortress in a sonic boom, getting Daisy and the others’ terrified attention.

""What in god's name is that?"" Daisy asked.

""It must be Cymbeline. The skinny freak's not going down without a fight,"" Carter said.

""But what can he possibly hope to hit out here, a swamp?""

""If the fortress has enough emergency power, he must have used the short-range targeting system.” Favian ran to Daisy and Carter. “There should be at least one settlement in its range.""

Hearing Favian, Daisy's face became pale white. Swiftly, Daisy readied to take action, but as she looked at Carter, she stopped, teary-eyed. ""Carter, I'm sorry.""

""I understand,"" Carter said, forcing a small smile.

Quickly, Carter dismounted from Flaremane. With a wave goodbye, Daisy valiantly flew off to quell the coming disaster. Daisy flew from the fortress in a red streak across the sky, creating a sonic boom. Faster and faster, she rode on Flaremane to catch the fireball trailing behind it. But as it closed on its target, with a tug of Flaremane's reins, Daisy outran it, intercepting its path.

""I won't let you hurt these people.""

As Daisy guarded against the fireball, the heat was unlike any she had endured. Endowed with Cymbeline's hellish hate, it attacked her flesh, reaching the wound on her side. But even with the intense pain, she forced the fireball upward away from the settlement. However, as it got further up in the sky, the black flames wrapped around Daisy and Flaremane. They quickly dragged the two into the heart of the fireball. And as the fire consumed them, it detonated in an explosion of brilliant light with a small fraction of the sun’s diameter, clearing the sky of clouds for miles.

\*\*\*

The sun rose on the first day of March. The David family waited outside Joseph's stable eagerly for Daisy’s return. But as the minutes mounted, so did their worry. Especially Belle, as her bloodshot eyes saw no sign of Daisy in the sky.

""She's dead,"" Belle said.

""Chief, don't talk like that,"" Aisha snapped.

""Like what, the truth? The monsters ruined our lives again.""

""Belle, stop it. God returned her to us once he'll do it again,"" Mary said.

Despite Mary's words, Belle's frustration hit its zenith, and she began to leave. However, Aisha stopped her, directing her gaze to something in the sky. Obscured by the sun's light, it soon became visible. As if escaping from the belly of the sun, Daisy flew down to meet her family with a smile.

""Sorry for being a little late, guys.""

Teary-eyed, the family dashed toward Daisy as she dismounted. They hugged each other with an unyielding grip, falling to their knees. As Mary kissed Daisy's forehead repeatedly, their relief overflowed as Belle and Aisha bawled their eyes out. A family reunited in peace after the trials of war.",2,1758884225.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Daisy ran over to the crowds, bewildered at what could have started the fighting. Favian soon summoned a giant water wall to separate the warring factions. But their separation only intensified the verbal attacks against one another. However, as they got louder and louder, the veins on Favian’s forehead bulged, ready to burst. *""Enough.""*Favian's demand echoed through the air, swiftly silencing the crowds.

""Your actions today have disrespected me, this army, and all the planets you swore to protect.""

A female Huǒ soldier quickly walked to Favian. ""General, of course, we respect you.”

“Then stop.”

“It’s not that simple.”

“Why not?”

“Sir, we’ve followed your orders faithfully through so many battles. But this time it’s too much. We can't fight beside the defectors. Our current mess is the latest in a long line. We can’t forgive the Nemesis.""

A male Nemesis walked to Favian and the woman. ""They fed us lies our whole lives. How much longer do we have to repent? Or maybe there was some truth to what the emperor said.""

With the Nemesis man’s words, he reignited the conflict. The berating had resumed louder and more furiously than ever. It was as if a great fire of malice swept across everyone, incinerating reason and leaving blind hatred. But it stopped as one deafening clap traveled through the base. As both sides searched for the source, terror ran through their ranks as they saw it. Damara, as the veins bulged in her forehead.

""We face a threat mighty enough to wipe us off the galaxy, and we still bicker. I told scared children our brave men and women would protect them, and now I can hardly look them in the eye.” Daisy zoomed over to Favian, scanning the crowds. “We're here because of the dream that all intelligent beings deserve to live free and happy lives. If you can't believe this dream, please leave. But for those that do, are you with me?""

Swiftly, a deathly silence washed over the base. The two sides stood in shock, seeing the fury of the gentle hero. The Nemesis man soon gave a nod to his counterpart, the Huǒ woman. As she reciprocated, their civil war was over. Daisy knew it as their malice disappeared, surveying their faces from left to right, seeing their attention pointed toward her.

""Thank you. Now, let's get to work and save Planet Aqua.""

\*\*\*

In the war room, the personnel gathered around Eugene. He worked expeditiously on his computer, decoding Anastasia’s data. The unease in the air was palpable as he inched closer to its secrets. But finally, he finished as a sea of flashing numbers appeared before them on holophone panels in midair. As he completed his task, Eugene's eyes widened, seeing the critical truth.

""Oh my god.""

*""Doc Parker, what does that mean?""* Carter asked.

""The fortress does have a weakness, General Carter.""

Hastily, Eugene pressed a button on his computer, drawing everyone's attention to the middle of the room. He summoned a holographic model of darkhold. But Carter's eyes were immediately drawn to three pulsing red dots scattered across the image.

""What are those three spots?""

""They're the secret, General Carter. You see, a darkhold fortress is self-sustaining. But it can't do that without astronomical power. Those three spots are the primary generators for the doomsday device. So if you destroy them, you cripple it.""

“But how are we supposed to get to them?”

“There’s one more thing.”

Swiftly, again, Eugene pressed a button on his computer. It made the model start shooting lasers, and slowly, Carter realized invaluable information.

""It’s an attack pattern. Like Lucas said.""

""Exactly. Its weapons have near-infinite permutations, but there's a bias toward defending those three spots, leaving areas open for attack.”

Carter squinted his eyes, looking at the model. ""But it's so narrow. Our movements will need to be flawless to have a chance.""

""Makes you wonder how that Fortis guy pulled it off,"" Yara said.

*""He pulled it off because he's the best,""* Sarah shouted.

“Everybody shut it.” Carter snapped. “Here's the plan. We'll break into three teams. There's no way we can get past the batteries with a fleet. So we’ll make do with a small and more precise attack.”

“And while General Carter and I lead the assault, the rest of you evacuate. If we can't save the planet, we can save as many civilians as possible,” Favian said.

*“Sir, yes, sir,”* The personnel shouted in unison.

\*\*\*

Later, the United Planets personnel were ready for their final desperate action. In the center of the base, two ships stood prepared to carry them to the great battle. But as Daisy ran over to join her comrades, her shield glowed. The light grew brighter and brighter until it blinded Daisy. However, as it dimmed, Daisy watched in disbelief as her weapon transformed into two smaller shields around her arms.

“What happened to my shield?”

“I did,” Divinus said, echoing in Daisy’s mind.

“Divinus? Why did you do this?”

“I have been watching you closely, Damara. You have upheld your end of our agreement. So, for the coming battle, I deemed it necessary for you to have a special gift, more of my power.”

Hearing the divinus, Daisy checked the quality of her new weapons. And she marveled at the ease of moving the shields. Now, she could defend from two directions far better than before.

“Thank you. These things will make defense way easier.”

“And one more thing.”

The shields caught fire into an intense blaze. But as Daisy almost jumped out of her skin, she quickly realized the flames weren’t hurting her.

“A new power to add to your arsenal. Against those ruled by malice and evil, these flames of purity are a devastating weapon, but for others, they are a means of protection.”

“Thank you.”

“Use these gifts wisely,” Divinus said in a dying whisper.

Swiftly, Daisy focused on her new powers. With a deep breath and all her concentration, she deactivated them. The flames extinguished, and her standard shield returned to her hands. And with a resolute look at her comrades, she quickly ran over. As she joined the others, Daisy giggled at an adorable sight. Carter and Clive were hugging. However, they broke away as they saw her. The two stayed far away from one another with bright red faces.

“Damara, do you have to laugh?” Carter asked.

“I'm sorry if I was being rude. But I just found your hug cute.”

“And use words like cute.” Clive pointed at Damara. “You know you’re just like a friend of mine, Daisy. She always says girly garbage like that.”

“Well, that's something,” Daisy said, playfully rolling her eyes.

“It sure is because—” Clive spotted Ros walking into his ship and smiled. ” I'd better get ready for the mission. See you after we win, Carter.”

“Right back at you, my friend.”

Clive dashed at top speed into the ship after Ros. Close by, Yara prepared to join the rest of her comrades inside. But as she tried to enter, Favian stopped her, looking her in the eye.

”Yara, before you go, I wanted to make something clear. Over these years, you've been an invaluable soldier and friend.” Favian took a deep breath. “But desperate times call for desperate measures.""

""I understand, General Favian. And it's an honor to risk my life for the cause.""

""And one more thing. Please play nice with General Carter's friend.""

""For you, sir, I'll do my best.""

Yara gave Favian a salute, and he reciprocated. And as she finished, she hurried into the ship with the others. However, as she left, Favian saw Carter about to depart with Daisy, and he ran over to them.

""General Carter, wait.""

Daisy and Carter stopped as they heard Favian. But Carter looked at him, releasing a deep sigh.

""I realize since we've met, we've had our differences. But because of Dr. Parker, we made it this far.” Favian extended his arm to Carter for a handshake. “Your judgment was sound, among other decisions you made. So you deserve respect.""

As Carter saw him, disbelief swept his face. Still, it soon gave way to a small smile as he accepted the handshake. 

”Same to you, hydromos. And good luck.”

\*\*\*

Daisy and Carter led their forces as they flew through the air. Carter gazed at Daisy with a confident smile. However, as the general spotted darkhold on the horizon, he looked at her again, his smile fading into a frown.

”I hope I can keep my promise to your mom.”

“Carter, don't talk like that. Stay focused, and I know we can make it through.”

“I think a kiss would do me more good than words.”

“We're right in the open.”

“We're far enough away from everyone else.”

Carter went in for the kiss. Daisy tried to resist, but she relented as he pulled her in. The two’s lips got closer and closer, but as they were about to meet, Flaremane shook madly, breaking it up. Carter almost fell, but he spotted Flaremane's smug grin as he regained his balance.

*”The horse did that on purpose.”* Carter shouted.

""Flaremane, I realize you and Carter have your differences. But we must be united to prevail.” Daisy rested her face against Flaremane's. “So, can you put aside your grievances for me, especially since I love you both?""

Flaremane shook his head in agreement after a few seconds. And as Daisy saw him, she kissed his head. Conversely, Carter was prepared to berate Flaremane. However, the ringing of his communicator stopped him. And reluctantly, he answered.

""What's the matter now?""

*""We saw the steed acting erratically. Is there something wrong?""* Favian asked over the communicator.

""Don't worry. Damara needed to teach it some manners.""

Suddenly, Carter heard an alarm over the communicator. Quickly, he recognized the sound, and his heart skipped a beat, realizing a terrible truth.

""The fortress is reaching full power again. And we're not close enough to dodge.""

Swiftly, the United Planets tripled their speed. The team cut through the air, but the fortress was faster. Like before, darkhold emitted dazzling purple light that bathed the battlefield for miles. And its guns launched a titanic salvo in the blink of an eye. However, as before, Daisy protected her comrades with her giant shield. They hurried into the narrow path as she deflected the plasma bolts. Daisy soon followed as the attack continued, surrounding them with certain death.

With their steely determination, the United Planets made it through the plasma bolts. But as they separated to attack their targets, Morana stepped out on a balcony and saw the assault. And as Clive's ship flew by, she shot it with her icy death beam.

*""Die, vermin,""* Morana shouted.

The ship crashed into the fortress as it made contact. Carter and Daisy’s faces became pale white as they saw their comrades go down in a fiery crash.

*""Clive,""* Carter screamed.",1,1758884094.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

It Turned Into a Feedback Engine (QR Code Generator Test),"We have a small specialty cafe with a regular customer base. Still, we couldn't understand why certain blends received so many repeat purchases, while others received none.

We decided to test feedback. We generated a QR code and placed it directly on the cup. We wrote at the top:

*Rate our coffee and get a discount on the next one*

The QR led to a short mobile form with 2 questions and a field for email. We used the QR code generator **Viralqr**:

1. You can create a dynamic QR code and change the form without reissuing cups
2. There is standard analytics (time of day, device type, city of scanning)
3. A very simple QR code maker. We adjusted the style to match our brand.

Results in 3 weeks:

* 258 scans (from \~1400 glasses)
* 191 feedback (74% completion rate)
* 97 email subscribers
* 41 coupons used (via Shopify)

Now we understand which changes had an effect, and even pumped up the email database as a bonus.

We want to create a similar QR code on the coffee filter bags that we sell in the market. But what is the best way to track scans from different points of sale (Whole Foods vs local)? Has anyone tried passing a ref through parameters in the URL?

We’ve been great friends since before we got together, and we communicate well. We’ve gotten through some difficult times together, and we’re a pretty good team. I love that about us.

We don’t always see eye to eye, but we’ve always made an effort to find a solution that everyone can get behind. Two years ago, we decided to go to university, and we’re both doing a bachelor’s and master’s. Since we made the move, sexual intimacy has steadily decreased.

We both have jobs, do well in school, and work out a lot, but we’ve been diligent in creating time for each other. We cook together, grab coffee, have friends over, go to concerts, and are overall pretty active. I totally get that after a long day, it’s difficult to get in the mood, and I don’t like being pushy.

I usually try to initiate in a way where I ask if there’s mutual interest, tell her I’ve been thinking about her in that way during the day, or just simply let her know I’m horny. For the past half to three-quarters of a year, we’ve had sex on average once a month, and it’s gotten quite monotonous.

We used to be much more frequent (1-4 times a week), more adventurous, and sometimes very kinky. I’m starting to feel this kind of heartbreaking rejection, and it’s affecting my self-esteem. The thought of initiating gives me anxiety, and I don’t know how to begin this conversation. I miss feeling wanted in an intimate way.
What do you think I should do in this situation?

tl;dr 

I’m a 26-year-old man in a six-year relationship with a 25-year-old woman, and I am struggling with decreased sexual intimacy. Despite maintaining a strong friendship and active lifestyle, our sex life has dwindled to once a month, causing me to feel rejected and anxious about initiating intimacy.",7,1758883955.0,relationships,3,0.89,False

Hi all,

On day 2 of launch, I hit **$1,697!! 🎉** …which sounds impressive at first.  
But the truth is, this has been **10 years in the making**… 😅

When you break it down, that’s an average of **$0.47 a day** — basically a sip of coffee.

Half of those years were spent sketching, researching, and filing patents, and the rest I lived as the “shutter guy” at my wife’s shop.

What I built is called **ShafCode** — a hand-drawn 2D code.  
It looks simple on the surface, but I believe it can be surprisingly fun and useful in everyday life.

Not many people know about it yet, but finally sharing something I’ve carried around for so long already feels meaningful.  
(My wife still wants to see more *results* than *meaning*, though 😅).

We work in the same field but not together, so colleagues but not outright co-workers, I only randomly see her every once in awhile. Might be a few times in a month, might be months till I see her. Anyhow, there are a few interactions with her that standout to me and I'm just trying to get an idea if they signal she's into me.

One time as everyone was leaving the room, she hung back for a second by the door as I was packing up and walked beside me as I was also leaving. Out of nowhere, we weren't in a conversation or anything just walking and not talking, she says to me how tired she is and thinks that she needs a coffee. Unfortunately I was busy, looking back I should have absolutely blown off my plans.

Another day, we were leaving but were chatting this time around, lots of smiles and eye contact. I decide to throw out that I was finished for the day at that point. She was smiling and making eye contact with me but when I asked her what about her, her face dropped, without breaking eye contact or a beat she told me what her very specific plans were. We parted ways right after that and she gave me a very noticeable finger wiggle wave while a big smile on her face.

Other than that just small things I noticed like her inconveniencing herself to sit next to me. Unprompted, as in we were not talking, playful comments from her. Or her having eyes locked on me with a smile if we spotted each other walking down the hall and continuing to do so as we closed the gap until we'd past and she'd say hi.

I know the answer to this is to just ask her out, and I've resolved I will next time I can actually chat with her. I don't really want to message her since I don't know if the number I have from her is her work or personal number. Though, when I do message her about something work related she will respond in minutes and offer to go out of her way to help.",1,1758883499.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I met a girl on Hinge, and since we spoke the same language, we connected quickly. Within an hour of matching, we exchanged socials and planned a date for the next day. I went straight from work, couldn’t find flowers (it was a Monday), so I made a small bouquet from daisies in a park, tied with a leaf, it was cute.

On the first date, we had food, coffee, dessert, smoked together, and I dropped her home. She asked if I was okay meeting her friends, and I was, so she introduced me to them at her flat. We smoked, chatted, and it went well.

On the second date, we watched a movie she got the tickets, had street food, and again I dropped her home. That night I had a late meeting (different time zone). She let me use her room, and later she and her friend joined me there. After finishing, I left.

The next morning she said she wanted to talk. In the evening, she told me she’s not ready for commitment but wants to keep it simple and see how it goes. I agreed.

But because of my past relationship, I was puzzled. I didn’t want to repeat the same mistake, so I asked her directly, if she wasn’t interested, she could tell me, but for things to move forward, there had to be a spark. She replied that we weren’t on the same phase and should stop. Still, she said I was the nicest guy she’d met and that she felt comfortable with me. I pushed again, saying I’d give it a try, but she said it wasn’t a good idea, then ghosted me.

The reason I asked her that was because of my college relationship. I was with a girl for 3 years, but we never defined it. We were very close (I’d even sing to her, though I’m a terrible singer). When I moved to another city, distance brought us closer, 4-hour video calls, missing each other badly. At the peak, I confessed I loved her she hung up on me. She ghosted me for 2 days, then called back, apologized, and confessed too.

But here’s the catch: I'm an asshole, I knew it wouldn’t work. She’s a one-man woman, and we’re from different religions. Knowing my family, I knew it wouldn’t be possible. So why confess? Because I believe if you don’t have the courage to say it, you don’t have the right to love.

She took it very seriously, saying her father never say no to her wishes and that she’d never find anyone else because she’d compare them to me. I hadn’t realized she felt that deeply. I explained I couldn’t commit. She ghosted again for a week, then apologized for pressuring me. We stayed good for 6 more months. Later, I even changed my work location to her city, IDK why. We met occasionally.

Then I found the new girl on Hinge. I told my college girl about it every time she diverted the topic. The next time I mentioned it, she broke down and asked me for three things, never reach out again, delete all our pictures, and never come near her if we crossed paths in public.

In short: I meet a girl on hinge, we both were comfortable with each other, we got close. She mentioned she’s not ready for any commitment, but wants to keep it simple. Because of my past, I asked her if she felt a “spark”, which made her fall back and ghosted me.

My past: 3 years collage relation never named it, we grew close even we know it couldn’t work because of family, religion. Yet I confessed my love She took it seriously, wanted a future with me I couldn’t give a commitment. Yet we were still in touch talk regularly. But when I mentioned about the girl from hinge. She stated to ghost me.

After meeting the girl on hinge, I deleted my account too, cause I was happy with her, but it’s didn’t go well, and I lost interest in using hinge now.

She was sitting in the canteen with her friends when I walked in.  
It was one of those usual chaotic mornings—crowded tables, the smell of samosas in the air, and someone already fighting the counter staff for extra chutney.

I grabbed a coffee and scanned the room for an empty seat—  
and then I saw Rayena.  
She saw me, too.

She stood up, left her group, and started walking toward me.  
DHUK-DHUK. DHUK-DHUK.  
My heart was pounding louder with every step she took.

I had nothing smart to say. Not even a casual ""Hi.""

She stopped in front of me, calm as always—  
but her eyes were narrowed, just slightly.  
She looked… a little angry.

""Where were you the past week?"" she asked.

I don’t understand how the same question could feel so easy for her to ask—and so difficult to answer.

Her voice held no drama. Just quiet curiosity.  
But the way she looked straight into my eyes… I felt like I owed her an answer.

""I went home,"" I said, trying to sound casual. ""Hadn't been there in months. Just… felt a little homesick.""

She didn’t reply right away. Just nodded. Then, without a word, pulled out the chair across from me and sat down.

Okay. Now I was dead.

Then—she smiled.  
A subtle, real smile.

""You didn't even text.""

""I… didn’t want to disturb you during exams,"" I stammered.

She tilted her head, watching me like I was some strange puzzle.  
""You wouldn't have disturbed me. Leave it — you were at home anyway.""

""Can I now?"" I blurted, without thinking.

She looked at me, confused but smiling.  
""Can you what now?""

""Call you?""

She blinked once. ""Reyansh… I’m literally sitting in front of you. Why would you call me now?""

Yeah, I didn’t think that through.

And then I went into the classic loop of mental self-destruction:  
Was I being boring? Should I crack a joke? Ask something deep? Say “I missed you”?

Nope. My brain froze.

So, instead, I just looked at her.  
Not in a creepy way—just long enough to find the courage to say something… anything…

That’s when she laughed.  
A soft, warm laugh. Natural, not forced.

""I was kidding,"" she said, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear.

""You can call me anytime, Reyansh. You don’t need permission.""

And just like that, the noise of the canteen faded.  
It was just me, her, and the sound of my heart sprinting.

Pandey’s samosa thudded loudly onto my table, followed by a tiny bowl of chutney.  
Of course, it was Pandey.

He plopped down like we were both invisible.  
""Bhai, ye log din bhar canteen mein rehte hain. Padhte kab hain ye?"" he said, stuffing his face.

I threw him multiple stares, subtle hints, raised eyebrows. Nothing worked. He just kept munching.

Rayena tried to hold the conversation for another minute or two. She smiled politely, said something about meeting her group, and then left.

And just like that, the moment was over.

I sat there, staring at Pandey and thinking—  
Just ten minutes, Pandey. You couldn’t spare ten minutes?

But then again… she did say I could call her now.  
Should I call her now?  
But she just left.  
Won’t that make me look desperate?  
God, no. I can’t be that guy.

Thus began the internal overthinking spiral.

Meanwhile, Pandey wiped his fingers on a tissue and stood up.  
""Chal, ek sutta ho jaaye?""

Was Pandey gay? Or… secretly interested in Rayena?  
Yeah, that question popped into my overthinking brain too.

I left that unsolved and instead asked Piyush and Rajveer later,  
""Bhai, should I call her tonight and talk… or play it cool for a few more days?""

Of course, she’d dropped hints. But I wasn’t sure if she really liked me.

That night, I learned one thing: Never unload your relationship doubts on friends.  
To them, it’s not emotional support—it’s an opportunity for free alcohol.

Maddy, I really miss you, bro.  
Times like these, your chaotic rants were exactly what I needed.

But Rajveer said something that stuck:  
""Do it before you get friend-zoned. Just tell her you like her.""

Maddy was still as inconsistent as ever.  
And Pandey? Still as irritating as ever.

Yeah, I had a lot to overthink—Rayena, Pandey, life, whatever.

I kept replaying the scene in my head, wondering if I should call her or text her, but today I had to keep everything aside because life doesn’t care about love-life cliffhangers—it has its own plot twists.

Because today wasn’t about emotions.

Today was about reality.

Today was the day every student fears.

It was Results Day.

Rayena got her 8-pointer. Maddy somehow passed all subjects.

And then there was us—Vikram, Dhruv, and Joshi—three backs each.

I was mocking them till I saw my result—four backs.

That one-night miracle? Not so real.

Before calling my father in the evening, I braced for what I expected: anger, disappointment, maybe silence.

But instead, he laughed.

""Yeh bhi journey ka part hai, beta,"" he said calmly.

And just like that, I sank into self-pity. Deep down, I knew—I had to deliver this time.

He didn’t scold me, which somehow made it worse.

I told myself,  
""Bas. Enough is enough. Time to fix everything.""

From now on, I’d study regularly, stay away from bad habits, quit smoking and alcohol too—yes! I will!

I mean, alcohol’s bad for the liver, wallet, everything.

No more! From tomorrow, I’m done.

Which obviously meant… today was the last day before quitting.

So I called Rajveer.

Twenty minutes later, we were standing at the bar wondering who actually wants to quit after one peg.

* **Founder with two phones:** “Tools don’t matter. **Ops** matters. Warm infra, clean pre-landers, rotate creatives, don’t be lazy.”
* **Media buyer in a hoodie:** “Short sprints? Sure. Long-term scale? Bring replacements and Tylenol.”
* **Compliance girl with iced coffee:** “Most ‘it works’ stories are selection bias. You didn’t hear from the five that got flattened.”
* **TikTok kid:** “Pass-through was 99%… for a week. Week two? The bot said ‘lol no.’”
* **Search bro, deadpan:** “Google’s like a bouncer now. Face ID, name on the list, shoes must slap.”
* **Native ads guy:** “Still the best playground if you know how to sandbox your patterns.”
* **Ops lead, whispering:** “Infra > software. WARM DOMAINS. UNIQUE SETUPS. ZERO SLOP.”
* **Account renter:** “Agency accounts help—until your funnel reeks. Clean angles still win.”
* **FP&A person:** “Operational tax is real. If profit dies after replacements and churn, it didn’t ‘work.’”

1. Still viable for bursts only

1nqxxae,https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1nqxxae/authenticity_is_the_biggest_lie_in_content/,"""Authenticity"" is the biggest lie in content creation. The most successful creators are professional liars.","so i’ve been thinking a lot about this whole “authenticity” thing everyone preaches on instagram. every growth coach, every thread, every reel is like “just be authentic, people love realness.” but honestly… authenticity feels like the biggest lie in content creation.

the creators who blow up aren’t just being “real.” they’re curating, scripting, editing, staging their life 24/7. the smiling coffee shot took 30 tries. the “casual” fit check was planned for a week. even the “i just woke up and filmed this” reels have perfect lighting and a hook in the first 2 seconds.

the truth is the most successful creators are professional liars. not in a bad way, but in the sense that they’ve mastered the art of storytelling. they know how to make their lives look interesting, how to dramatize normal stuff, how to make you feel like you’re seeing “behind the scenes” when really you’re just seeing another layer of the performance.

and the wild part? audiences want that. we say we want authenticity but we’re bored by actual real life. no one’s engaging with a 100% raw video of someone eating cereal in a messy kitchen. we want the polished version that *feels* real but still entertains us.

idk, it just makes me wonder… if “authenticity” is the advice, is it actually hurting small creators? cuz you try to just “be yourself” but meanwhile the people winning are treating their content like a movie production.

what do you guys think? is instagram even built for authenticity anymore or is the game really about faking it well enough that ppl believe you’re authentic?",4,1758883031.0,Instagram,2,1.0,False

Be it random meetings I didn’t need to be in last-minute tasks from my manager, agreeing to partying and drinking when i didn’t want to but saying yes so that don’t get mad at me, even running around grabbing coffee for the team. 

Last Friday, I finally hit my limit. Sitting at my desk at 7pm my inbox is still blowing up and here i am staring at my screen thinking how the hell did I let this happen again?

Then it clicked. Every time I said yes without thinking, I was basically giving away my time to everyone else’s priorities. I started tiny: said no to a 30-minute sync that could’ve been an email, passed on reviewing a doc that really wasn’t my responsibility, even skipped a quick brainstorm because I had real work to get done. At first it kinda felt awkward like I was being rude or lazy. But holy shit the difference was immediate. By friday evening, I’d actually finished my work without staying late for the fifth day in a row.

here’s the thing: we all assume productivity is about grinding harder putting in more hours. But honestly? It’s way more about protecting your time, spotting the stuff that doesn’t actually matter and saying no without feeling guilty. Once you do, suddenly everything else becomes way easier.

Who else has felt this? Saying no sucks at first, but once you start, it’s like someone lifted a weight off your brain.

1nqxsgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Emmaolivy/comments/1nqxsgt/ecofriendly_packaging_usd_driving_sustainability/,Eco-Friendly Packaging USD: Driving Sustainability and Cost Efficiency in Global Trade,"In recent years, the demand for eco-friendly packaging has surged as consumers, businesses, and governments recognize the urgent need to reduce environmental impact. Packaging has long been a critical part of global commerce, but its reliance on plastics and non-biodegradable materials has raised concerns about sustainability. Enter **eco-friendly packaging**, an innovation that prioritizes recyclable, biodegradable, and compostable materials without sacrificing durability or product appeal. For companies trading internationally, measuring the cost of eco-friendly packaging in USD has become essential, offering a global benchmark that simplifies comparisons, procurement, and budgeting. This pricing clarity helps businesses make smarter choices while aligning with environmental and economic goals.

One of the most compelling advantages of eco-friendly packaging is its **positive impact on consumer perception and brand loyalty**. Shoppers today are far more environmentally conscious, often preferring to purchase from brands that adopt sustainable practices. Businesses using recyclable pouches, compostable films, or biodegradable cartons can highlight their commitment to reducing waste, thereby strengthening their brand identity. When priced in USD, eco-friendly packaging allows businesses—particularly exporters—to present their sustainability initiatives in a way that resonates with international customers. For instance, a company that invests in eco-friendly coffee bags can promote not only the quality of its product but also its contribution to environmental stewardship. Over time, this consumer trust translates into stronger loyalty, repeat purchases, and long-term profitability. **For more:** [**Eco Friendly Packaging**](https://mtpak.com/mtpak-ecofriendly-packaging)

https://preview.redd.it/rbjkwn5vkhrf1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9ca48b798a15c9ae2ee67d4d4445d93192881ca

Another key factor driving the adoption of eco-friendly packaging is its **cost-effectiveness when analyzed through USD pricing benchmarks**. While sustainable materials may initially seem more expensive compared to traditional plastics, long-term savings often offset these costs. Lightweight designs reduce shipping expenses, recyclable materials minimize disposal costs, and compliance with environmental regulations avoids costly fines or penalties. Moreover, as demand for eco-friendly packaging grows, economies of scale are reducing per-unit prices. By tracking costs in USD, businesses can clearly assess whether sustainable packaging is feasible for their specific needs. For example, international suppliers often quote prices in USD, making it easier for global buyers to compare eco-friendly options against conventional alternatives.

Eco-friendly packaging also contributes to **regulatory compliance and supply chain resilience**. Many countries are introducing strict laws that restrict single-use plastics and encourage the use of recyclable or compostable packaging. Businesses that fail to adapt risk disruptions, fines, or reputational damage. By investing in eco-friendly solutions, companies not only meet compliance requirements but also future-proof their operations. The USD pricing model simplifies cross-border procurement by standardizing costs, allowing multinational businesses to integrate sustainable packaging into their global supply chains more seamlessly. Whether for food, cosmetics, or e-commerce products, adopting eco-friendly packaging helps businesses operate responsibly while maintaining consistency across markets.

Looking to the future, the global market for **eco-friendly packaging priced in USD** is poised for rapid expansion. Innovations in material science, such as plant-based polymers, mushroom packaging, and water-soluble films, are making sustainable options more accessible and affordable. At the same time, digital printing and smart packaging technologies are giving businesses new ways to enhance branding while maintaining eco-friendly principles. By evaluating packaging costs in USD, companies can accurately plan budgets, negotiate with suppliers, and scale operations across borders. As sustainability becomes a defining factor in global trade, eco-friendly packaging not only reduces environmental impact but also enhances brand value, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency. For businesses and consumers alike, eco-friendly packaging in USD represents more than just a cost—it is an investment in a sustainable future.",1,1758882555.0,u_Emmaolivy,0,1.0,False
1nqxse1,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1nqxse1/is_there_a_meaning_to_this_or_am_i_just_crazy/,Is there a meaning to this or am I just crazy?,"I’m not super spiritual. I don’t consider myself a spiritual person, but my mom definitely is and so I’m pretty open to it and I’m around it a lot. My aunty (her sister) went on a spiritual awakening journey about 4-5 years ago and she saw some spiritual person who told her that this man that was involved in her life (in the past) was definitely her twin flame; they had just separated/went their own ways and I believe they aren’t in contact with each other anymore. Then she and my mom educated me on what twin flames were, and it made sense to me that she and the guy were twin flames. 

Anyways, from that conversation I realized that this guy in my life at the time was my twin flame. We instantly connected as soon as we met. It was like he was literally me but in a different body. We just understood each other really well and all the feelings and attraction were mutual. It was insane instant attraction like I’d never felt before. 
We then had a period of not talking, but eventually we came back together about 9 months later. The second time we were even closer, we spent a lot of time together etc. The first time we were together it was with romantic intentions, but the second time around we started talking and hanging out again with the intention of nothing more than friends. But of course as time went on we started doing things that ‘just friends’ wouldn’t do, but we were never in a committed relationship. 

This was the first relationship I had ever had with a guy where I overstepped that boundary. Usually I have a firm boundary that doing anything past what ‘just friends’ would do, we need to be in a committed relationship first. For some reason I didn’t feel the need to have that boundary with him, and I also didn’t feel the need to be in a committed relationship with him (very rare for me). 
Anyways, the hanging out and talking went on for about 10 months total until I moved away. The week or two leading up to me leaving he started being avoidant. And then we just stopped talking. Nothing ended on bad terms necessarily, it just ended. 4-5 months later and we are both in our own committed relationships and not connected on any social media. 2 years later, I notice that he and his girlfriend split. And it was out of the blue that I had realized this. The girlfriend had public socials that I really only looked at maybe twice before that moment. But one day I just felt this weird gut feeling and I looked, and they’d broken up. I found out that they had broken up about a week before (from outside sources lol). 

I’m still in my relationship. I love my boyfriend, I really do. I want to marry him and when I envision my future, he’s in it. But lately I just can’t stop thinking about my twin flame. (And I would never leave my boyfriend for him, if that even matters).
It started about a month ago randomly. One day, I just felt his presence(?) in my chest. Like it just felt like I was feeling his soul very strongly. And since then I can’t get him out of my head. It’s driving me crazy. I’m starting to feel obsessed with him again almost. Like I need to know what he’s been up to/how he’s doing, etc. and he’s appeared in my dreams a handful of times now and I’ll wake up with a weird sense of comfort. I’d honestly love to see him again and just catch up over coffee or lunch or something, but I won’t ever reach out to him because it’s just wrong.

With the rising popularity of [**home decor modern contemporary**](https://yourwarehouze.com/), many homeowners are embracing a design philosophy that balances minimalism with luxury, creating spaces that feel both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

https://preview.redd.it/2cuhd8buhhrf1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=645eb9a6ec3202ee039841dcbe25da00c31e6264

Contemporary design is all about clean lines, neutral tones, open spaces, and elegant accents. But what makes it truly appealing is its ability to evolve. Unlike other interior design styles that stay rigid, modern contemporary decor adapts to trends, technology, and lifestyle needs, making it one of the most versatile options for today’s homeowners.

At YourWarehouze, the goal is to bring this versatility into your living spaces with carefully curated products that blend beauty, quality, and function. Whether you’re planning to redesign your entire home or just upgrade a single room, diving into this style can transform the way you live and feel in your space.

# Understanding Home Decor Modern Contemporary

To truly appreciate modern contemporary decor, it’s essential to understand its principles. Unlike traditional styles that often rely on heavy textures and ornate details, this design thrives on simplicity. Think open layouts, uncluttered surfaces, and natural light flooding the interiors.

**Here are a few defining features:**

* **Neutral Color Palette:** Shades of white, beige, gray, and muted tones dominate the base, creating a calm backdrop.
* **Statement Pieces:** Instead of overcrowding, each room highlights one or two bold elements, like a striking sofa or a large piece of art.
* **Blending Materials**: Metals, glass, stone, and wood often come together for a chic yet warm atmosphere.
* **Focus on Functionality:** Every piece of furniture and decor has a purpose, maintaining the balance of form and function.

This adaptability ensures that modern contemporary design doesn’t feel sterile—it’s personal, flexible, and stylish.

# The Role of Furniture in Modern Contemporary Spaces

Furniture is the foundation of this design approach. Instead of bulky, overly ornate pieces, modern contemporary favors sleek silhouettes with ergonomic comfort. The focus is on blending beauty with practicality.

For example, a sectional sofa with clean edges can anchor a living room while doubling as a cozy spot for family gatherings. Dining tables in polished wood or glass can act as both statement pieces and practical surfaces. Accent chairs, coffee tables, and modular storage units also play a key role in maintaining balance while elevating aesthetics.

This is where exploring a [**home style furniture store**](https://yourwarehouze.com/furniture/) becomes crucial. It allows homeowners to discover curated collections that align with modern needs while keeping the overall theme cohesive. The right store doesn’t just provide furniture—it offers a design experience that transforms your home into a reflection of your personality.

# Lighting as the Soul of Modern Contemporary Design

One cannot talk about home decor without emphasizing the importance of lighting. In modern contemporary interiors, lighting does more than illuminate—it defines mood, enhances ambiance, and highlights architectural details.

From recessed ceiling lights that offer subtle brightness to dramatic floor lamps that add character, every fixture plays a role in shaping the atmosphere. Natural light is maximized through large windows and open spaces, while artificial lighting complements it with warmth and focus.

Among the most sought-after trends today is the inclusion of [**crystal chandelier luxury**](https://yourwarehouze.com/a-glimpse-into-the-world-of-high-quality-crystal-chandeliers/) in contemporary settings. While chandeliers have long been associated with traditional grandeur, the modern reinterpretation blends sleek designs with sparkling crystal elements, making them the centerpiece of living or dining areas. The result is a timeless mix of modern minimalism and opulent elegance.

# Why Choose Home Decor Modern Contemporary?

The beauty of this style lies in its flexibility and universal appeal. Here are some reasons why it’s worth embracing:

**1. Timeless Aesthetic:** Its simplicity ensures it never feels outdated.

**2. Personalization:** The neutral backdrop allows you to add colors, textures, or statement pieces as trends evolve.

**3. Comfort Meets Functionality:** Designs prioritize livability, ensuring every space feels inviting.

**4. Investment in Quality:** Rather than cluttering with multiple pieces, focus remains on high-quality, impactful items.

With these benefits, modern contemporary decor is perfect for both compact urban apartments and spacious homes.

# Bringing the Style to Life with YourWarehouze

At YourWarehouze, the philosophy of home decor modern contemporary is at the heart of every product offering. From stylish sofas and versatile sofa beds to luxurious lighting fixtures, the brand curates items that transform spaces into works of art.

Imagine a living room anchored by a cloud-like couch, complemented by a geometric coffee table, and crowned with a sparkling chandelier. Or a bedroom with a sleek reclinable bed, minimalist nightstands, and subtle wall art—all tied together with warm lighting. This is the vision that YourWarehouze brings to life.

What sets the brand apart is its focus on quality and design synergy. Every product is not just furniture—it’s a part of a larger narrative that defines your lifestyle.

# Tips for Designing with Modern Contemporary Elements

If you’re inspired to incorporate this design style into your home, here are some practical tips:

* **Declutter First:** Start with a clean slate by removing unnecessary items.
* **Choose a Neutral Base:** Build your decor around whites, grays, and soft hues.
* **Invest in Statement Pieces:** One bold sofa, chandelier, or artwork can anchor the room.
* **Mix Textures:** Pair sleek glass with warm wood or matte metals for visual balance.
* **Layer Lighting:** Use a combination of ceiling, wall, and floor lighting to create depth.
* **Add Personal Touches:** Use curated decor items like vases, cushions, or rugs to express individuality.

# Final Thoughts

Embracing home decor modern contemporary is about more than just aesthetics—it’s about building a space that mirrors your lifestyle while maintaining elegance and comfort. With carefully chosen furniture, impactful lighting, and a thoughtful approach to design, you can transform your home into a true sanctuary.
