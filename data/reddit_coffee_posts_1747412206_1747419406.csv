Captain James Erikson, NAUSF

NAUSF Asteroid-Class “Madison”

June 5th, 2125

Titan, Low Orbit

We've been stationed near the New American Union's orbital research post around Titan, why, I don't know. We'd be better suited to patrolling the Kuiper Belt, sniffing out the Indian operations there or chucking torpedoes at the Chinese military posts on Thebe, but command has us here, and it's not my place to question them. The atmosphere of Titan creates a pale blue sheen over the moon, with Saturn acting as a background. Every once in a while, I see a flash of light from the surface, a missile hitting its target or an unfortunate patch of rock. I take a sip from my mug, the bitterness of my coffee hits my tongue and floods my taste buds in just the right way to wake me up. The bridge is pretty cozy, all things considered. I sit on the captain's chair in the center of the room, below me are a few dozen officers, all making sure the ship isn't under immediate threat. Looking down to my command console, I see nothing out of the ordinary, no ships without ID's, no incoming STS missiles. A calm day, or, cycle, as command seems so intent on calling them. 

“Sir?” One of the officers looks up, a Second Lieutenant Carpenter, staring at me with a wide-eyed expression. “What is it, Lieutenant?” “Contact coming from Neptune, heading straight for us.” Shit. Only one thing that could mean. “Chuck it on main.” I stand up as the view of Titan is covered by a black expanse, a green triangle representing us, a white circle for Titan, a green dot for the research station, and a blue triangle representing the unknown contact. I look down to the command console and press down on the broadcast button. “Command, this is Asteroid-Class Madison, ID 77-Zeta-Gamma-092. Unknown contact spotted, need visual.” A few seconds later, a gruff voice comes on in my earpiece. “Copy, copy, Madison. Contact location?” I look back up, it's still coming straight for us. “Zero degrees, coming straight at us, about 2000 klicks out and approaching fast.” “Copy, copy, giving visual.” The main screen switches again to a satellite in Titan's orbit, locked on to the unknown ship. It looks like a commandeered Indian or Brazilian ship, but the markings have been sprayed off. In its place is a sigil, and next to it, a line of characters I don't recognize. Then I see what's below that. “ORION UNION FIRST CONTACT SQUADRON.” 

I press down on the broadcast again. “Command, this is Madison, please tell me you're seeing what I am.” “Aye, Madison, we see it.” I stare at the image of the ship for a few more seconds, wide-eyed. “Any record of an “Orion Union” before? Maybe a ship ID?” “Nay, and the ID registers it as a European vessel. Make contact, see what they want.” “Copy copy.” I take my hand off the button and flick open the PA, turning it on. 

“Attention, all hands to battle stations, repeat, all hands to battle stations. An unknown ship is approaching, ID registers it as European, but it doesn't look like any European spaceship I've seen.” I turn off the PA and start issuing orders, the bridge now abuzz with activity. “Full power to engines, get us as close to that ship as possible, and load torpedoes!"" “Aye, sir!” Rings out across the bridge and the ship shoots off away from Titans orbit to intercept. 

It takes a tense half hour to reach the unknown ship, but we finally got within hailing range of it. “Sir! Unknown contact hailing us!” “Accept.” On screen, a massive window appears of a flag I don't recognize, flying alongside the USA's, a nation that hasn't existed since the 2020's. Text appears on it, reading. “We are representatives to the Stellar Federation of the Orion Arm. We have replicated a ship similar to your own so as to not alarm you. We hail from outside your home system. Do not be afraid.” Only text means they probably can't communicate with us verbally, if they are alien, as they say. “Respond back with a text message. Read, we are the New American Union Space Force ship Madison, state your purpose or we will be forced to fire upon you.” The comms officer relays my message to this “Orion Union” and a minute later, the text on the screen fades out and is replaced. “We require an escort to your nation's leaders. We wish to commune with them.” I can't help but crack a smile at the message, it was obvious they didn't know much about our culture, considering they basically said “take us to your leader.” I press the broadcast button again. “Command, this is Madison, contact has been made with the unknown vessel, they want an escort to Earth, how proceed?” For several minutes, I didn't get a response, then the same gruff voice from earlier responded. “Fly them to the coop and give them basic operating procedures, if they wanna talk, they'll need to know how to dock.” “Copy copy.”

Purchased (new, ~100-125 USD) in June 2024. I used it about 2-4 times per day (frothing setting which uses 4 fl oz milk each time.) Always hand wash it using Dawn/Palmolive dishsoap and with a 3M nonstick-safe sponge. I am pretty careful about not burning the milk, although there was a couple times early on where I did burn the milk. Over the past ~2 months, the non-stick surface has been wearing off. It was pretty gradual. At first, I thought perhaps I hadn't cleaned it sufficiently, but soon realized what was occurring. I no longer use it.

Besides the wear, it was not practical: you have to wait a long time for it to cool off. If you're brewing 12oz coffee (6oz cup x 2) by the time you're done with the first cup, the Aeroccino is still not cool enough to froth a second time. And then you have to wash after each use, too.",1,1747419076.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

1ko7p1o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ko7p1o,That time I came out to my entire industry (this week),"I came out at work about four months ago.  But I work from home, and aside from a handful of video calls and a presentation to our company's LGBTQ employee group at the end of March, I've not really been visibly trans to my coworkers.  They see my new profile picture, my new email address and pronouns, but that's about it.

So naturally, the next obvious step was to show up in a skirt in front of 1,600 customers, suppliers, and other colleagues in my industry. 😅

Don't worry.  There is no trigger warning on this post.  You can safely read it without worrying that this is going to crash and burn for me.  It was a really, really good week.  Don't get me wrong, I learned a lot about what it means to be a woman in a work setting, and I got hit on by drunk dudes on at least two separate occasions.  😓  But I also gained dozens of networking contacts, three new bathroom besties, and a metric dump-ton of self-confidence.

There is no TL;DR to this post.  It is long.  And really, it's the same story repeated over and over—I felt self-conscious, someone said or did something to make me feel better, and I emerged on the other side affirmed and accepted.  But in a world of so much fear and pain and paranoia and worry, it's worth remembering that being trans can also be the best thing that ever happened to you.

*Day One*

My flight to Atlanta started the kind of early that only airports and toddlers can make us endure.  I got up, got dressed in the dark, but on the bare minimum makeup I wear to go out (eyebrow pencil, eyeliner, and mascara), and drove through the rain to the local airport.  This was my first time traveling under my new driver's license, under my actual name.  I had a low-level nagging feeling of worry about that, especially since PreCheck did not show up on my boarding pass.  It was still under my old name, and although I submitted the paperwork the day before to get it changed, it can take up to 45-60 days for the change to be processed.  I was stuck with full body scanners and all the anxiety that implies.

Oh, and I was flying to Georgia.  Granted, most of the laws on the books there are focused on kids, and I'm 47.  But still, it implies a general attitude about transgender people that I did not really want to encounter.  But I pulled my big girl panties all the way up—both pairs, the better to tuck without a gaff—and boarded the plane, vanilla matcha latte in hand.

The flight was uneventful in the extreme, except for a few minutes of turbulence as we fought through the rainclouds into the clear sky above.  (METAPHOR ALERT)  But we were still landing in Atlanta, the Deep South, and all that implied.  I deboarded the plane with a belly full of butterflies, as well as those nasty spice cookies that I never eat except on Delta flights.

It was still early, so I walked from Terminal D all the way to the ride share pickup zone.  Was anyone watching me walk?  Did it look masculine or feminine?  Should I have paid more attention to my hair that morning?  To my makeup?  What if I got stopped?  What if the Uber driver was mean to me?  I took the whole trip to the hotel downtown in a heightened state of fear, neglecting to notice that exactly _none_ of my fears were coming true.

The hotel was one of those big jobbies with a built-in convention center, perfect for... well, conventions.  It was only about 8am, well in advance of even the earliest early check-in, so I found a coffee shop serving pre-made beverages at frankly ruinous prices and settled down to do some work.

Hey, guess what happens when you drink a matcha latte, burnt airport coffee, a small bottle of water, and another matcha latte over the course of four hours?  I think you know, but I'll make it explicit.  Ya girl had to peeeeeeeeeeeeee.  No worries, the lobby was pretty much deserted.  I followed the signs to the lobby bathrooms, only to find that both th men's and the women's rooms were locked behind a room keycard.  Which I did not yet have.

Dag.

I crept up to the front desk, did a few silent vocal warmups to put on what passes for my Lady Voice, and asked the clerk if there was a bathroom around that did not require a key card.

""Oh don't worry!"" she said brightly.  ""I'll let you in.""  And so I followed her, wondering which bathroom she was going to unlock for me, and what I was going to do if she unlocked the wrong one.  But I didn't have to worry.  She marched right up to the Women's room and scanned me in.  ""There you go, ma'am!""

I was on cloud nine.  (Until, of course, ten minutes later when I realized that I had left my phone in the stall and had to ask her to scan me in again, but that's just perfectly normal awkwardness and nothing at all to do with being transgender, so we'll just leave it at that.)

Pretty soon I was able to check in to my room and enjoy a bit of privacy.  I changed out of my travel clothes and into my Day One outfit of a white sweater with black stripes, and black knee-length skirt.  I did my makeup.  I got some work done.  I did my hair.  I got some more work done.  Finally, around 4pm, I went downstairs to register, and face everyone in my industry that still didn't know I was a woman.

It went—drum roll please—fine.  Just fine.  I came across a coworker who greeted me like the old friend I was, and went through and picked up our badges together.  They got my name right.  We went to the evening reception, talked to a bunch of other folks in the industry that I knew, and drank a glass of scotch that I desperately needed.  For those who want details, I can report that there were three primary reactions from the people I knew.

(1)  ""Oh hey!""  A pause.  ""It's been a while!""
(2)  ""Hi, nice to meet you!""  A brief explanation.  ""Oh, wow, okay!""
(3)  In a whispered voice, ""We heard about your transition, and I just wanted you to know that we support you 100%.""

That was it.  Not a single weird look, not a single unkind word.  I got deadnamed accidentally twice, both by people who immediately caught themselves and apologized.  I was told how nice I looked several times.  In short, I was treated as well as I could possibly have wished.

And then I proceeded to just... do my job.  And forget, somehow, that I was doing it in a skirt.

Day One Ma'am Count:  Eight.  (TSA agent, flight attendant twice, Uber driver twice, coffee shop lady, and two separate hotel clerks)


*Day Two*

The first day of the actual conference.  I attended general sessions and breakout sessions.  I asked pertinent questions of panelists and listened to the Voice of the Customer.  I had meals and shook hands and introduced myself with my new name dozens upon dozens of times.  I was complimented on my outfit, a pink women's suit jacket with light lavender shirt and maroon pants.  But basically, it felt like every other iteration of this same conference that I've attended throughout my career, dating all the way back to, I think, 2018.

I was amazed to realize that all the fear and self-consciousness was just... gone.  I hadn't forgotten that I was trans, had not forgotten that I was here as a woman.  But that fact stopped being something to worry about, or even to notice except for the growing ache in my feet, which despite practice at home were not used to wearing these shoes all day.

That evening was a rooftop party, and the dress was ""party casual.""  I had brought what I thought was a suitable dress, but when I put it on, a lot of my fears and worries came back.

I sent a picture to my wife.  ""Are you sure this is work appropriate?"" I asked.

The response came a minute later.  ""Yes!""

""It's just that the skirt seems a bit short, and you can sort of see a bit of cleavage at the top.""

Her reponse was direct.  ""That's because you have breasts.""

Sensing my worry, she gave me a call and reminded me that I had a sort of privileged viewpoint when it came to looking down the front of my dress.  ""Don't look down, look in the mirror,"" she advised.  ""How does it look?""

I blocked out my face and just looked at the image of a very normal woman in a very normal dress.  ""Fine.""

""Skirt not too short?"" 

""No.""

""All right then, I've got to go.  Oh, don't forget to be careful when you bend over though!""  And then, very helpfully, she hung up.

Of course she was right.  I got compliments on the dress, and looked basically the same as many of the other women there.  I did get a couple of surprised looks from coworkers who, despite the angle, caught enough of a view of my chest to see that my bra was more than merely decorative, but no one asked me about it.  I did notice that quick little dip down of the eyes a few times, followed by blatant, sustained eye contact.  But basically, I looked normal and no one cared.

The part itself was a lot of fun, if for no other reason than it became a lesson in human gender dynamics.  Guys held doors open for me.  They got me drinks or snacks.  They also remained standing, looming over me as I was sitting down, to talk about boring subjects which I no longer remember.  At one point, a particularly verbose old dude was talking to me and another lady, and we did that sort of meet-eyes-and-smile thing, a bit of sisterly solidarity in the face of an old blowhard.  Chef's kiss, worth the price of admission right there.

I also got hit on.  Once again, I was sitting down while he was standing.  I started getting questions that drifted into more personal than business territory, which then ended with an open ended question of whether me—oh, and my group, of course—was doing anything after the event.  I said no, I was planning to get some sleep for the next day of the conference, and then stood up to refresh my drink.  That's about when he realized that I was six foot plus and he... well, he was not.  His eyes widened a bit, he made some excuses, and zipped off.

The day gave me a lot to process.  For the most part, I was treated just like any other business person doing business around other business people.  But there was this additional level of courtesy and deference, often unconcious, which forced me to take the unusual steps of not being last through the door, not waiting for someone else to go through the food line in front of me.  But as if to offset that little bit of chivalry, I discovered that relative corporate rank no longer served as a surrogate for who deferred to whom.  I'm a Senior Director at my company, a step below VP, and in the past I found that that rank sort of guided the way that other people interacted with me.  But the dude who was hitting on me was a junior developer of some sort.  To him, and to many others, my status as a woman established the power dynamic in a way that my years of seniority at my company no longer did.

Day Two Ma'am Count:  Four (Two separate servers at mealtimes, a bartender, and some lady who was in charge of the party venue.)


*Day Three*

In some ways, this was a carbon copy of the prior day, with different keynote speakers and different breakout sessions.  But I started to notice something that I'd never noticed before.

People were saying hi to me.  By name.

I'm used to a wave here and there from people I'd met before, or maybe the vacant smile that says that they met me after too many craft cocktails to put a name to the face.  But no one forgot Shannon.  I was greeted with a smile, a wave, and ny name more than a dozen times before we took our break for lunch.  ""If you want to stand out in your industry,"" I texted my wife, ""I highly recommended attending a conference while trans.""

Let's face it, I don't blend in the same way I used to.  Early on, I was terrified of that thought.  I enjoyed my relative anonymity, and knew that by transitioning I would be giving that up.  What I did not realize is that there are advantages to being memorable, when the people around you are kind.  It used to take half a dozen visits or more to a restaurant before I could home to become a regular; now, people remember my favorite orders on the second or third go.  That same new superpower, extended to a business context, meant that the networking I had done the day before had actually stuck way, way better.

The final event that evening was a cocktail party, and of course I had a dress already prepped for it.  I put my hair up in a bun (!), refreshed my makeup, and rode down the elevator feeling much less anxious than I had the night before.  I'm pretty sure I got checked out a few times, and even though I had no interest in any of them, it was just nice to be noticed.

I didn't realize I had to pee until I got downstairs, but I'd been using the ladies room consistently during the conference, so there was no reason not to do so again.  When I got inside, though, I found a situation I had not encountered before.  One woman's dress would not zip up.  Another was trying, and failing to help her.  I peed, listened to their conversation while I did, and steeled my resolve.  I flushed, opened the stall door, and asked if I could help.

We all tried to fix it.  Another girl came in, and she started helping too.  I held a phone as a flashlight while the last girl succeeded in getting the fabric unstuck and getting the dress zipped.  We high fived.  We introduced ourselves to each other, which we had not yet done.  I got called bestie.  And the four of us went to the party.

Y'all, that was one of the defining moments of my _life_.  Far from being treated with fear or revulsion, I was accepted as who I was and gtreated with friendship and acceptance.  After that, the party was an anti-climax, but I still finished up the evening satisfied.

Day Three Ma'am Count:  Five (Four bartenders and an AV guy who needed me to move out of the way.)  Honorable mention, I was on the receiving end of a ""Good evening, ladies!"" as I walked in with a handful of other women at the start of the party.


*Day Four*

That's today.  Now.  I'm writing this while sitting at the Atlanta airport, waiting for my flight and hoping the storms to the west of here don't delay me.  I've had a couple of ma'ams today, but to be honest, I've stopped counting.

We see so many horror stories of trans people being treated like perverts, receiving fearful looks and hateful words.  And there is violence, the natural outgrowth of the fear and hatred.  There are laws that are designed to repress us, to quiet our voices, to proclaim to the world that we have no right to live.  These things happen, and I'm not at all trying to claim that they don't.

But there are good stories too.  People are kind, and empathetic, and caring.  They are welcoming and accepting.  They are awkward and bumbling too, so concentrating on their own self-conscious anxieties that they forget anyone else has them too.  Weeks like this one are simply part of the identity that I am slowly building for myself.  I feel like more of a woman today than I did last week. 

And that's good.  I have another conference coming up next month in Nashville.  3,000+ attendees expected.  Time to start picking out a dress.",4,1747419011.0,TransLater,0,1.0,False

I just got my degree. The convocation gown, the photos, the certificate – all of it should have felt like closure. But the thing is, you don’t really ""graduate"" from an IIM. You survive it. You process it in fragments. You carry parts of it with you, for better or worse.

And maybe that’s what this post is – my way of processing the last two years at IIM BLACKI.


The Arrival

I didn’t come from an IIT or a top-tier college. I came in wide-eyed, from a basic Tier-3 engineering background, with nothing but hope and hustle. Some came from corporate jobs, some straight from SRCC and Stephen’s, some with 2 years of UPSC prep behind them. The diversity hits you fast, and so does the hierarchy.

You think it won’t matter. That your story is unique. But it does. Your undergrad, your work-ex, your PORs, your undergrad CGPA, even your grooming – everything is currency. And your worth on campus is constantly recalculated based on it.


The Hustle Begins

Term 1? Chaos. CV reviews start before you've figured out where the mess is. You beg seniors to look at your CV – some do, some don’t. Some choose people who ""look the part."" Others become your lifelines. You meet all kinds.

You walk around in the same formal shirt for three days straight, editing your resume down to a single line, obsessing over font size and bullet structure. You wonder how this is what you left your job (or city or home) for.

Then comes the Summer Placement Week. You think it’s a game of strategy. It's actually a game of chance disguised as one. You hear ""Day 0,"" ""Day minus 1,"" and you scramble to get shortlisted, only to realize that your fancy work ex doesn't matter half as much as someone else's undergrad tag.

Finance? Forget it unless you’re CFA+SRCC/St. Stephen’s+Excel wizard. You pivot to consulting. Everyone does. Not because they love it, but because it’s Day 0. And everyone wants to survive Day 0.

The Great Unlearning

By the end of Term 2, you’ve forgotten who you were before BLACKI. You don’t romanticize the campus anymore. You don’t post about “grateful to be here” unless you just got a shortlist.

You realize that placement committees, CV points, and professor perceptions carry more weight than you ever imagined. And even if you’re good – smart, driven, well-spoken – it might not be enough. This place doesn’t just humble you. It rewires you.

People you thought were brilliant don’t get placed. People you didn’t expect to shine – do. Some firms show up, some vanish. Some people get PPIed, others get ghosted. You watch it all unfold like a simulation with a dicey algorithm.

And that’s when anxiety kicks in.
Not the kind that you can write off with a few deep breaths. The kind that makes you wonder if your loan was worth it. If leaving your job was worth it. If you’re worth it.


The Mid-MBA Crisis

Third term? The intern wait begins. You like the company, you want the PPO. You don’t like the company, you still fear getting a PPO and being forced to accept it. You hate the job? Too bad, you might have to take it. You love the job? Good luck getting that offer.

And then comes the exchange dilemma. You need to choose to opt for it in this term. Another 7-8 lakhs. More debt. More guilt. You're from a middle-class family that has never spent ₹100 on themselves without thinking. Now you’re planning three months in Europe? With people you barely know, hoping the trip isn’t just an expensive photoshoot?




You’ll feel like a product on an assembly line. Companies negotiate. Profiles shrink. Expectations lower. And yet, you play along.

You see friends cry in their rooms after getting rejected. You see brilliant folks not getting placed till the very last day. You cheer for them when they finally do – or stay silent because you got placed earlier and don’t know how to be happy without guilt.

This is when your real friends emerge. The ones who didn’t just drink coffee with you in Term 1 but sat with you in silence during summers.


What They Don’t Tell You

Your GPA matters way more than you think.
The brand on your undergrad still follows you.
Some seniors will ignore you; some will become family.
No one’s journey here is the same. But the pressure? That’s equal-opportunity.
And you never really get used to it – you just learn how to carry it better.


TL;DR

Prestige doesn’t guarantee respect. You fight for it every day.

Summers, PPOs, finals—nothing is predictable, except that it’ll be hard.

The best part of this journey? The resilience you build. And the people who help you build it.


If this resonates, I’ll write Part 2. But for now – this was the first year condensed into a few thousand words.

The gentle glow of the laptop sat upon the circular dining table, illuminating the exhausted face that stared back into the light. Her hands firmly wrapped around a warm mug of vanilla-flavored coffee; her second serving. She had spent countless hours job hunting through these forums and none that she had come across appeased her. Not in the way she thought when she had moved out into the city. 

Waitress, receptionist, dishwasher, and dog walker. Nanny positions that required way too much for too little pay. How disappointing, she thought, her life outside of the country. Maybe Mama was right and she was better off staying put in her hometown. 

She had mindlessly dragged the little mouse onto the advert to open the forum. Posted only a few minutes ago and it still remained available? Maybe it was meant for her. 

She picked up her smartphone that sat just beside her hand, dialing the number highlighted on the screen, and brought it to her ear. 

It rang for a few seconds before the phone picked up. The gentle voice of a woman spoke on the other end of the line. 

“(Your character's last name)’s office. You're speaking to Lauren. How may I help you?” 

She paused for a moment, brows furrowed. She was silent but her lips fell agape as she attempted to speak. She had heard of the name before, but hadn't dialed this office, had she? Was she *that* exhausted?

“Oh- oh… um… yes, I received this number from the forums? Is the nanny position still readily available?” she stuttered.

“Oh, yes, of course. What is your name? I can schedule you in for an interview sometime later today. Does noon sound alright with you? Mr. (Last name) is taking this position very seriously and requires all applicants to have a meeting with him personally.”

“Yes, that sounds right. My name is Mariela. Mariela Boyd.” 

“Alright, Miss Boyd. We will be expecting you in our downtown office by noon. Please check in with me at the front desk,” the woman insisted. “Oh, and please arrive in a timely fashion. He does not like to wait.” 

“I will, thank you for the opportunity,” Mariela said with a smile before the line dropped. 

A sigh fell from her lips and her shoulders untensed for the first time in weeks. The lengthy process of searching around for a job would finally come to an end, she thought. She could finally start her new life in the city doing something she loved dearly. 

She wondered over the businessman and his family. She wondered over the child she would be watching and if it would be anything like her teaching back at home. She wondered what “being able to shift her life to accommodate something new” meant in fine print. What exactly would she be getting herself into? 

After a moment of daydreaming, her eyes flickered to her laptop screen, dulled at this point from inactivity. She lingered towards the small clock in the bottom right hand corner. 

8:34 am

Three hours until her interview to be a nanny for the rich businessman. 

—-

I hope this little “starter” background intrigues you enough to get a taste of the idea I have! Basically, my character is a small town teacher who is not satisfied with her slow pace of life. She moves out to the vast city in hopes of finding more to life than all she has known so far. She comes across a job advertisement to become your character’s nanny (preferably one child). Your character just so happens to be a very well-known and wealthy person in the city for reasons you come up with. He can own a corporation, a law firm, or is just hereditarily wealthy. 

I am generally very open to whatever you decide to do with your character (I hate creating my partner’s characters for them as I would hate for you to control my own character) but I do ask that the premise of the beginning of the two’s relationship be that your character has recently (or not) suffered the loss of their wife and the mother of the child my character will be nannying. Overcome with grief, he is unable to properly care for his own child, and wants to find a stable character in the home for them to avoid inconsistency. 

Imagine this as a “sent from heaven” arrangement. His late wife sends this woman to be a part of his life to help both him and his child heal from her passing, giving him another chance at love. 

It does not need to be mushy in the way it sounds. Their relationship can be intense, passionate, and feel forbidden and enjoyable all at once. It can be a clash of emotions that they cannot escape from with sprinkles of the night life, riches, and parties that my character has never experienced before. 

I'd love for this story to be long term. Writing examples are not required. If this story interests you, send me a chat request. We can discuss more details in private.

1ko7nox,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1ko7nox/preparing_to_heal_from_abuse_and_explore_casual/,Preparing to Heal from Abuse and Explore Casual Connections After Moving – Need Advice!,"Hi everyone, I’m new to this forum and could really use some wisdom from this amazing community. I’m a 31-year-old mixed-race lesbian, and I recently left a deeply abusive relationship. I’m planning to relocate in June or July to Pahrump, Nevada (pop. ~44,000), to start fresh, where I’ll be living with my lifelong best friend and his wife. I’m seeking advice on two things: how to heal from the trauma of the abuse once I settle in, and how to safely find casual sexual partners in Pahrump without driving an hour to Las Vegas. I’ll share some context below—it’s heavy, but I want to be honest so you can understand where I’m at.
The Abuse I’m Trying to Move Past
My ex-partner (let’s call her Sarah) was manipulative and controlling in ways that broke me down over our three-year relationship. It started small—she’d criticize my tomboyish style (flannel shirts and sneakers), saying it was “too butch” and embarrassed her in front of her friends. It escalated from there. She demanded to check my phone daily, accusing me of cheating if I texted anyone she didn’t know. If I pushed back, she’d scream for hours, calling me “selfish” or “disloyal,” and sometimes she’d lock me out of our apartment overnight, leaving me to sleep in my car.
Physically, it got worse. Sarah would grab my wrists hard enough to bruise if I tried to walk away during arguments, claiming she “had to” to stop me from “abandoning” her. Once, she threw a glass at the wall near me because I forgot to do the dishes, and the shards cut my arm when I ducked. She’d apologize in tears, but then blame me for “making her snap.” She also isolated me, guilting me into cutting off friends by labeling them “toxic” and convincing me to quit my job because I was “too stressed” to work. By the end, I was a shell of myself, always tiptoeing around her temper.
I left a month ago after she threatened to “out” me to my conservative family if I didn’t prove my “loyalty” by moving across the country with her. That was my breaking point. I packed a bag, blocked her, and started planning my move to Pahrump. I’m not there yet, but I’m already worried about how the memories—her voice, the fear, the shame—will linger. How do you start to let go of this kind of abuse? Are there therapy techniques, journaling prompts, or daily habits that helped you rebuild your sense of self? I want to begin my new life in Pahrump feeling like me again, not this scared, broken version.
Finding Casual Connections in Pahrump
The second part of my post is about easing back into intimacy in a fun, low-pressure way once I’m settled. I’m not ready for a relationship, but I miss the playful, flirty side of being a lesbian. Pahrump has about 44,000 people, which is bigger than some rural towns, but I’m still worried the queer dating pool might be small, and I’d prefer not to drive to Las Vegas every weekend (it’s about an hour away, and gas isn’t cheap). I’m looking for tips on finding casual sexual partners locally.
For context, I’m into light, flirty stuff. I love long, spontaneous makeout sessions, like sneaking away for a heated kiss in a quiet corner of a bar. I’m also into sensual massages with scented oils, where things can get teasing and playful without being too intense. And I enjoy fun role-play scenarios, like pretending we’re strangers flirting over a “first date” at a coffee shop, letting the banter build to something more. Nothing heavy or super kinky—just connective and fun.
My question is, how do I find women into this in Pahrump? Are there dating apps that work well for smaller towns like this? I’ve tried Tinder before, but it’s often just straight folks or bots in less urban areas. Once I’m there, how can I subtly signal I’m queer and open to casual fun without outing myself to the whole community? I’m concerned about gossip in a town where people might know each other. Also, any tips on staying safe when meeting new people in a place like Pahrump? I’m nervous about inviting strangers over or going to their place in a community I don’t yet know.
Thank you so much for any advice you can offer. I’m anxious but excited about this fresh start in Pahrump, and I’d love to hear what’s worked for others in similar situations!",1,1747418920.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

It gets like this a lot, and I usually just wait until I wake up in a good enough mood or I have things I need to do to actually get ready and leave the house. 

I'm looking for any tips, maybe even herbal supplements or remedies I can use to fight the depression and actually live my life. I can't take antidepressants, it's complicated. 

Today I've woken up late, not made anything to eat, only had a coffee, I've not showered, brushed my teeth, or done anything except for watch a show I like. 

I have so much to do, and there's a lot of pressure. There aren't any jobs where I live and everyone is struggling to get one, and I could really do with something part time. I've been putting off calling someone back who's offered me some work because of the anxiety, which I don't have on a good day.

I really need to start getting my life in order, I'm slowly sinking more and more. My health, finances, and will to carry on are all suffering. 

I have eating disorders and have always struggled with my weight, so if anyone knows of some easy, readily available, cheap high-calorie foods that have helped them I'd love to hear from you. I haven't been cooking meals regularly for a long time.

I also need something to fight the fatigue, coffee doesn't perk me up at all, there's no word I can think of for what it does to me. Calms me down, but not the deal with anything and get things done calm that I long for.

1ko7mme,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ko7mme/aitah_for_feeling_like_my_relationship_is_over/,aitah for feeling like my relationship is over?,"Okay, so, my boyfriend (M19) and myself (F21) have been dating for 3 years. When we first met, I loved that he was so kind and friendly to everyone he met, saying good morning to other people on trails we’d walk on, etc. He was a huge support for me during a particularly rough year with family, and he provided me a lot of safety and comfort, and would often get me out of the house to do things when I was sad. 

When it came down to choosing a university to attend, he changed his mind so much that I ended up accepting an offer from a school, that a week later, was no longer on the table for him. He ended up staying to live with his parents, while I moved out of town. 

His family treats me like I’m one of their own. I love them all so so deeply. I love the events that they do for holidays and the casual drop-in coffee visits, and they always listen to what I have to say, which not many people in my own family did. 

But, fast forward to the beginning of this month, we go on a trip across the country together. He paid for SO many things and I felt incredibly guilty that I didn’t do more. 
However… when I spent over a week with him, I found out that he really wasn’t the person I fell in love with 3 years ago. 
Throughout the trip, he was making consistent, extremely racist comments about other people (we’re white), wouldn’t trust me to get us to where we we’re going on public transit and needed to be seeing or doing the directions (he’s NEVER enjoyed doing that.) and also generally just being super negative and/or bossy. I booked everything, I planned everything, I found stuff for us to go do, etc.
Even when telling him to stop being racist because I personally think it’s disgusting behaviour, he would just get defensive and say “it’s not racist if it’s true.” or “someone needs to say something so that it’ll change.” For context Reddit, he’s talking about the mass immigration of people from Southeast Asia into our country. While I can understand some of the frustration coming from people who have lived in our country their whole lives, I have also just gotten to a point with it where I choose to not let it bother me, because I don’t enjoy giving energy towards hate. It doesn’t make me feel good. He evidently doesn’t feel the same. 

During the trip he also made me feel really guilty about not having sex with him, would kinda make jokes all day that I “should’ve given him something by this point”, and ultimately pressured me into giving him head by the middle of the trip. Also for context, I have not felt okay in my own body or confident enough to partake in bedtime activities because my brain and body has genuinely not had a moment to fucking rest since September. I have a lot of stuff outside of this relationship that he is fully aware of, that drains my battery and at the end of the day, I genuinely just want to go to sleep. 

Also, for work, he does sport refereeing and will often skip out on chances to come see me because of this job. When I ask him to take “just one weekend” off from a super busy season where he’s working almost every night, he says no. He will never come see me unless there are very little to no games over a weekend. Which like partly makes sense but also is frustrating cause he’s doing it every day anyways. He will also make comments about the games he’s missing while visiting me as well, which doesn’t make me feel nice. 

When we returned home, I overheard him and his mom talking in the car. She was asking him if our plan to transfer to a new school together in 2026 was still happening. He said “mmm probably not I think I just wanna stay at home, or maybe go to Europe or the East Coast” This crushed me because for the longest time up until that point he was serious about moving in with me and taking the next step in our already 3 year long relationship.
Because he stayed at home and hasn’t had to pay for anything, he can afford to go anywhere, and I genuinely can’t follow him. I mostly believe he’ll stay at home, but still. 
When I asked him about it later, I said “So… no [university name]? I kinda thought you were in on that…”
Him: “Well, ugh, I don’t know. Probably not.” 
Me: “Oh, okay.”
Him: “You know, I think like, I should go do my own thing somewhere for a couple years and you should do your own thing here. Then we’ll just come back to each other after and we’ll have had our own experiences.”
Me: “So we’d break up for a bit?”
Him: “Oh no. No no no I don’t wanna break up with you. I love you so much… do you wanna break up with me???”
Me: “No, I don’t think so… I just don’t really understand what you mean, or why the plan keeps changing. I understand that you’re young and—“
Him: “I can’t have it all figured out right now.”
Me: “No I know that, and you’re more than allowed to want to go do these things, but I can’t come with you to do them, nor does it really sound like you want me to. So, I just can’t really tell if you really want me to be included because I never know what’s actually going on, and it’s stressful for me.”
Him: “But every time I do tell you something you get upset so what’s the point?”
Me: “Okay.”
Him: “But you do love me right?”
Me: “Yeah, I just said that. Of course I do I’m just really tired right now.”
Him: *silent treatment the rest of the way to my house*

Anyways so after sitting with this for a bit I’m kinda realizing that he might be stepping towards being on his own but he doesn’t wanna hurt me, and I especially don’t wanna hurt him but I am completely disappointed that he has turned to racism and is expecting me to give him my body whenever he asks for it. All my friends are telling me to dump him, but after 3 years that’s so unfairly hard to do. A big part of me still loves him very very much but I almost never feel like his priority.

I have a tradition of giving small gift bags to the people involved in my kids’ education at the end of year.  My oldest is in a SpecEd program and leaving elementary school.  I usually give gifts to the paras, the gen ed teacher, library/music/etc staff with a slightly “better” bag for the main educator.  My youngest is in preschool in a small classroom.

I usually provide a home baked good, a gift card to a union supporting coffee shop ($10), and a handmade tchotchke like a keyring in the school colors or canned jam, etc.  main teacher was getting a target gift card ($20) as well.

Both my kids are aging out of their schools and I want to make this special, I am also going through a small health crisis and surgery.  I figured a simple baked good is doable but I’m not able to craft ATM.  We also live in a pretty liberal area and I think anyone would feel conflicted over a Target gift card right now.

For some context, we have been living with family for a while following emergencies at our previous apartment, we have been pretty low income so this was a big help on both money front and just getting us out of the situation. (we are still paying to live here just less than an actual apartment would cost).

Some of the supposed reasons we are inconsiderate, gaslighting or entitled: 
1. Ruining cast iron pan. Which can’t be true because neither me nor my husband has used the cast iron, I personally don’t even know where it is kept. 
2. Staining glasstop stove. Again wasn’t us because the stain is exactly where a dutch oven was left by someone else sitting for a month without moving. 
3. Eating ice cream that wasn’t ours. This happened ONCE because we were buying the same brand and not assigning shelves in the freezer. We apologized and offered to replace the ice cream. We were accused of eating a second ice cream months later (which we didn’t) and told we were trying to gaslight him about it. 
4. Not mentioning paint damage. When we first moved in we asked about potential paint damage from hanging stuff on walls. We were told “not a big deal, that will give me an excuse to repaint” we removed a bunch of stuff from the walls and of course yeah there was some paint damage. We are supposedly inconsiderate for not mentioning this and offering to help fix it. 
5. Not sure exactly what to list this as but husband was asked to babysit (not paid), to which he said yes but asked would it be okay to go back downstairs after putting them to bed because of a prior engagement that is supposed to start at 7:30 but could push back till 8:30 just for this. This was apparently unacceptable and rude and showed that my husband “didn’t care” about family. 
6. Staying longer than expected. When we moved in we were never told a time frame that we needed to be gone by. We were just supposed to apparently know somehow that they only wanted us here for like 6 months (its currently been about 10) this was only brought up like a month ago and when it was brought up we were told to be out by August. Even though we have since established that we are getting an apartment in 1-2 months it keeps getting brought up and mentioned that we apparently feel “entitled to help” and are “taking advantage” of people by staying here. 
7. This is more of a vague point but my husband was told that he doesn’t think about how his actions will effect those around him. This is the most out of character thing I’ve ever heard someone say about my husband. 

My husband is taking the brunt of all of this as it’s his family, but it’s so hard watching this happen. My husband is one of the most considerate people I know. Flat out a better person than I am. He constantly mentions stuff to me about being worried about getting in the way or upsetting his family. Frequently asks for reassurance that him doing simple tasks (cooking, making coffee, showering) is okay because he feels like he will bother people. 

It is now at the point where both my husband and I are letting our health and hygiene fall to the wayside because we are worried about further upsetting his family. We stay downstairs or leave the house as much as possible, and try so hard to fully avoid any contact with family when possible.",1,1747418558.0,mentalhealth,2,1.0,False

* Reading - I'm especially into scifi and fantasy along with some horror and nonfiction.
* Meditation - I regularly practice the Soto Zen Buddhist style of sitting meditation and am part of a local meditation group.

I’ve bought countless bags over the years, but there’s always something that bothers me about them. I’m hoping someone here can help me finally find the one.

  
One bag that comes very close in terms of material, pockets, and style is the **Aevor Utility Sacoche – Black**, but unfortunately it’s too small for my needs

  
Another bag that looks nearly perfect is the **Alpha One Niner CHIO-X Bag** – great layout, design, and materials – but it’s not available in Europe and slightly too large, which is a dealbreaker

# What I need in my perfect shoulder bag:

* A **zipper** for the main compartment (no flap/messenger-style cover)
* A **rectangular shape**
* Available in **Europe** (I’m in Switzerland/Germany)
* Can be worn **Indiana Jones-style** (not a backpack, not chest-rig style)
* Size: **larger than 28cm × 8cm × 24cm**, but **smaller than 35cm × 26cm × 10cm**
* Has an **inside zipper compartment** that fits a passport
* Can **comfortably hold a small rain jacket**

# Nice-to-haves :

* One or more **outer zipper compartments**
* **Mesh pocket** for a water bottle
* A **strap that’s not seatbelt-like** (prefer something more padded or textured)

Day 1



We flew from YEG to YYZ to LIB. Which meant we were travelling for over twelve hours. I don’t recommend this but I do recommend bare minimum an extended comfort seat and maybe some sleep aid. The view is beautiful on the flight here! 


For other Canadians who may be flying to a major airport first and are confused about the layovers/connecting flights work: we were dumped directly into the departures terminal in YYZ so we did not have to go through security a second time. We will have to go through security again on our way back though.


First Impressions while landing: beautiful views wow. And it is indeed humid and we burned a bit just in the short drive to pick up the car rental. 


We chose VAMOS! They were really nice :) When we came out of the airport, we were scared to tell random people asking us where we were going (because VAMOS warns against scammers/people misleading you) but we had two different gentlemen who helped us find the VAMOS shuttle when it was very busy and we weren’t misled at all. 


Driving in Guanacaste: the roads are indeed narrow with no shoulders but dang they were paved better than Canadian roads are. Just drive carefully the first day and by the next day you’ll be zipping around corners and using your hazards like a pro! 


La Gaviota, First Day: again, super nice people. We got a welcome drink when we came in, they all helped us bring our luggage up. Beautiful beach, DELICIOUS food, amazing sunset, and great view from the rooftop pool. Plenty of kitties and some dogs came up to visit us. 


We ate the tuna tartar and the red snapper with accompanying sides and it was so so delicious! The best food in all of Playa Hermosa!!


The only negatives is that our AC is the room had quite a few large ants and the windows are missing some screens. The bathroom has poor air circulation, and the cold water is just room temp water in the taps. I sprayed the windows with witch hazel and left some q tips of tiger balm around and that seemed to deter the ants! 


But they filled our water bottles with ice water every day which is amazing. 




The hardest part of driving is getting used to the car and going up hills without 4x4 - but just shift into down gear and you’re good. 


—-

Day 2



Breakfast at the hotel was delicious! We all got the typical breakfast since it was included. It was so incredibly delicious. While at breakfast we gave into our one day per vacation where we allow ourselves to buy something fun from the people on the beach. We all got some matching bracelets from a nice lady. I’m not telling you how much we paid because it hurts, (CAD exchange rate is terrible when they base everything here on how much American money equivalent) but I also want these ladies to be able to feed their families and stuff so. Anyways! They don’t pester you so you can just say no. The lady who does braids has this yummy coconut cake thing though, tastes like Christmas so that’s like $3,000 CRC so definitely get that. 


One of the staff members (they are all SO nice by the way) told us more about the boat tour which was $100 USD ($50,000 CRC) per person, so we paid a deposit in CRC in cash and planned for the next morning. 


Side note: there was like nobody else staying here. We’ve had this place to ourselves the entire time! 


We stopped at the super mart here in Hermosa to grab some extra sunscreen, bug spray, wipes, toothpaste, drinks, a bag of ice, tampons, and pads. Which all came out to about $100 CAD. We then drove to Comunidad to go to the bank to take out more cash for the boat ride, and we also went to Cafe Mariposa and had a light lunch and some coffee. So many butterflies everywhere and really yummy coffee. 


While driving to Playa Conchal we stopped in Huacas at the fruit shop there and got some coconuts and a giant mango. Then we drove to Playa Conchal and enjoyed the beach and got some of the fun pineapple drinks and relaxed. Nobody super pestering us there either, just an offer and away they went. We paid $20,000 CRC for two alcohol drinks in the pineapple with watermelon. Which, is about what we’d pay here honestly so again, not mad about it. 


We drove back to La Gaviota, and it rained half the time, and made it back at sunset. Despite darkness and rain it was a decent drive. 5-6 is like a rush hour time though so traffic can get a bit backed up at some intersections.  The drive there and back was full of beautiful trees, we saw some goats and chickens and lots of iguanas. 


We then went to Aqua Sport and had a quick dinner of ceviche and fish tacos and they gave us free shots, and we got to hangout with more dogs and cats! The food wasn’t as good as here at Roberto’s. 


 Tips of the day: 
- you gotta drive both mildly aggressively and defensively at the same time. 
- don’t be afraid of doing stuff in the afternoon. Not everything needs to be done in the morning the way everyone tends to recommend. 



Day 3



Breakfast at Roberto’s. Free and again delicious. You HAVE to try the tortillas with gallo pinto and shredded beef on top. We saw some squirrels, giant iguanas and birds during breakfast. 


It is boat day! We went on the boat for three hours and we saw some scenery, stopped at some caves, and went snorkeling and saw some fish! And they cut up a pineapple for us to share. It was a good time! 


We returned to the beach to do some swimming and ate some coconut, and then we played around in the rooftop pool. This is where I got sunburned - always re apply after exiting the water. No matter. What. 


We ran back into Comunidad to get a delicious star fruit mousse tart and some coffee from Mariposa again. It was yummy! Then we had dinner (tuna tartar and some mahimahi) and relaxed for the evening. 


Day 4



Diamanté Adventure Park - insanely humid. Incredibly not busy. We enjoyed the coffee and chocolate demonstration, and the zip lines a lot! The hills there are insane I don’t know how the shuttles make it around. The buffet food was decent, rice beans and pico and actually their little pizza was good 


We ate dinner and enjoyed our last sunset on the beach with some swimming and drinks! 


Day 5



We dropped off the rental car and got picked up by the ILT shuttle to go to La Fortuna. The drive is so beautiful and as you pass under trees you can hear the cicadas above you through the car. 


Checked in at Los Lagos then went into town to walk around, get some dessert and coffee at Tayakyri, and finished with dinner at Soda Viquez. We recommend the bistec with garlic and the bistec casado! Then went back to Los Lagos and went into the hot springs for a little bit before going to bed. It was pouring rain the whole time and I wore cotton and felt fine. 


The rain is insanely loud when it’s a heavy pour so it will wake you up in the night if you’re a medium to light sleeper. 


Day 6



We had breakfast buffet at Los Lagos and it was really good. We had some altitude sickness so we took a four hour nap, and then went to the hot springs and walked around the property for the rest of day. 


Day 7



In the morning we hiked up to el mirador (the lookout) in the mist and got some nice photos and nice wet humid walk. Then we went and had breakfast really fast. We freshened up then went and did the La Fortuna Waterfall where we got some photos with the sun out and then on the walk down it was pouring. It was amazing. We then enjoyed an iced coffee at vita cafe and it rocked my world. 


We then got jungle bowls and they were massive and delicious but we couldn’t finish them. Then we did some souvenir shopping and went back to Los Lagos. We packed our things then had dinner and had a few drinks in the hot springs before heading to bed. 



Day 8



We ate breakfast at the resort and travelled home. Things I learned on the drive back were that ILT is owned by a Canadian guy and he has a good team of workers, and he’s about to open a hotel. The driver stopped at a small shop where we used bathrooms - they had yummy looking food and some souvenirs. All souvenirs are priced the same. We were VERY nauseated on the drive back. 


The LIB airport is..a bit wild. We couldn’t check in online and we had to wait in line at the desk where one lady made us all test our luggage size - which is weird because we saw people on our flight with bags the size of checked bags and I have no clue how. 


The security is easy and fast. The airport is tiny. The coffee and bakery place is robbery - $30 CAD for a sandwich and a coffee. The boarding process was very quick. We ended up on a SunWing plane which was nicer than our WestJet planes. It was just a very crowded airport at 1 PM. We travelled 16 hours total this day from La Fortuna to Liberia to Toronto to Edmonton. My legs were insanely swollen. 


When landing from international, you must follow the exit signs for arrivals and then go back upstairs through security again to get on your new domestic flight. Our layover was 90 minutes and it took 60 minutes to get off the plane and through the airport. 



Reviews: 


- VAMOS rent a car was great. Good car. Sweet people. Good shuttle service. Good prices! 

- We loved La Gaviota Tropical. Everyone was so kind and attentive. We even got our laundry done by Cynthia for only $20 (USD) and we tipped the heck out of everyone there. The sweetest men working there as well. All very kind! 

- Definitely do a boat excursion! It’s just a fun way to spend the day and they will fish for you while you swim or explore a beach or whatever. 

- ILT Costa Rica was a great shuttle service but I do recommend finding something Costa Rican owned if possible. I wanted to use Arenal Rides but the website wasn’t working. 

- In La Fortuna, the prices are all over the place for everything so just go with your gut if you want a specific souvenir. But buy coffee and sloth keychains from the grocery store. Definitely eat at the sodas and walk around! 

- We used way more cash than we thought we would! We ended up spending about $600 CAD or 246,000 CRC - paid the boat, some food, all our tips, souvenirs, and the waterfall entry and a few other things. 

- Uber is super easy to use in La Fortuna we used it for everything! I tipped the full price of each trip. 
- Everywhere had WiFi! 

- Everyone in the beach area was nice. For whatever reason here in La Fortuna, especially at our resort, the women were really rude? Like I’ve actually never seen anything like it - EXCEPT the lady who cleaned our room and one of the hosts at the restaurant. She was nice. The men were so kind especially the ones driving the shuttles.


Things we brought or bought there that we used and were glad we had:


- an eSIM with 2 GB data

- wet wipes

- vacuum packed towelettes 

- anti-chafing stick

- a whole box of anti nausea and anti diarrhea

- three pairs of shoes (runners, boat shoes, and sandals) plus water shoes and cheap $2 hotel slippers from giant tiger 

- lactaid for my lactose intolerant girlies

- extra underwear 

- a good quality poncho 

- our go pro

- plastic bags

- a microfibre towel

- a thin quick drying backpack 

- tiger balm 

- witch hazel 



Things we brought and didn’t really use but you might:


- a portable charger 

- more than 2 PJ shirts

- extra sunglasses (we didn’t lose ours on the zip line or in the ocean or anything) 

- multiple bathing suit covers 

- more than 2 hats


Things we didn’t pack and wish we did (remember we didn’t have a checked bag): 


- a long sleeve shirt and pants for the rainforest and not just the flight 

- nail clippers 

- bug spray and sunscreen prices were about the same but would have been easier to bring 

- a steamer for the beach (no steamer or iron there but a steamer was at Los Lagos) 

- our favourite body lotion 

- prep h or afterbite for mosquito bites 



Things to know/be aware of:

- Canadian WestJet specific: Over half of our flights were dark flights with no access to WestJet connect or WiFi. Without any notice or warning. So bring your own entertainment. 

- Just don’t buy anything that’s already priced in USD. As Canadians we hated that and even if you requested in Colones it was still overpriced. Just buy things with original prices in colones. 

- There are a lot of dogs on the road while driving. And other animals. We saw a dead one. Mostly in la fortuna arenal area we saw them everywhere. At the beach they stuck to the beach paths. 

- At the beach. It’s hot. It’s sunny. It can also be quite humid and your sunscreen will melt off. So you WILL burn. Even with multiple applications of sunscreen. Reapply before you think you need to. Bring your own after sun! 

- Roads are not bad at all. But share the road and be aware of your surroundings. 

- The pour on the alcohol is nice and heavy here. The rainforest elevation gets you drunk faster! 

- Los Lagos does NOT offer any shelves in their shower, and only has one garbage in the entire inside, it does not have any lotion and they will not replace extra towels you ask for and use. 

- It’s actually a short drive to lake arenal - the long part is having to go all the way around the lake to la fortuna 

- The mountain roads may make you nauseated. 

- Use bug spray even by the coast


Hopefully I’m not missing anything. We can’t wait to go back to Costa Rica! :)

1ko79r0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1ko79r0/should_i_move_or_should_i_start_a_business/,Should I move or should I start a business?,"About two years ago now, I unexpectedly moved back to the town I went to college in. I always really liked the town, but felt very ready to leave and never really thought I’d return to it. 
Lived in a major city for a few years, didn’t enjoy it, and moved back here during a rough time. I had plans to move across the country to a place I love, and have yet to do it. My partner is willing to move with me, but is in no rush to do so. I myself feel torn. 

Pros of my current situation: 
- My partner and I have a ton of friends here, including my best friend 
- It’s beautiful and fun to be here April-September/October 
- I feel comfortable and safe here 
- There’s a lot of good food and bars here 
- I have a gym and a doctor I really like here 

Cons of my current situation:
- I’ve always felt I’d prefer to live in a medium sized city rather than a very small or very big city (this one is very small) 
- I’m worried if I never move across the country like I’ve always wanted to that I’ll regret it, but I always want to avoid making a major life change based on a Is the grass greener? Mentality 
- Winters are hard on me, I get SAD
- I’m far from my mom, and it’d be nice to be closer to her as we start a family 

The other confounding variable is that I’m not doing what I want to do career-wise. I started a job out of college kind of at random because I had an in and was feeling decision paralysis, and I’ve been with it since, but I have no desire to do it forever (or even much longer). I’m passionate about f&b and hospitality and would love to own a business (more specifically a coffee shop and/or bar) with my partner, and I’m willing to work side jobs to support that. However, starting a business would more or less cement us here, at least for a few more years. 

The central question is, do I move or do I stay and find purpose/contentment through work and give up my fixation on living elsewhere. I see a world where staying and being happier with my work life would ultimately make me a lot happier here, but of course, you never know.

It’s been a minute since I wrote anything. But I wanted to share this one experience I had in NYC. Not enough karma to post where I want yet, so this one’s just going on my page for now. 🥲

It was kind of wild…🐯

Okay, you don’t have to believe me…honestly, I barely believe it. 😂

I’d just wrapped a shoot, got to Penn Station, and needed to get to Grand Central for another one. I was out of it…I just lost my backpack. Luckily, I tracked my iPad I left in it the next day, but in the moment, I had my fanny pack, my luggage, a coffee some lady bought me out of pit, and yeah, a stuffed animal. 🧸 

Suddenly, I spill the coffee all over myself. The cute guy sees this happen and comes over to help. He introduces himself, and while I honestly can’t remember the detail of our conversation, I do remember him asking me out…and offering to get me a cab to Grand Central before heading to work. He said he was in a rush but could help me get there quickly. 🤭

We get in the cab, we’re chatting, and then, out of nowhere, he takes my hand and puts it on his thigh. He keeps guiding my hand there, and part of me is into it…but then he tries to push my head down! I’m whispering, no, we can’t do that…the cab driver is right there…but the cab driver isn’t reacting or paying attention. So I just go with it. 

I started blowing him in the cab. I can’t even explain the feeling. He’s moaning, soft like he’s trying not to make a sound, and I’m there half-laughing, not because it’s funny…just because I can’t believe it’s actually happening.

But we couldn’t finish. We pulled up to the hotel and the driver wouldn’t circle the block.

And yeah… there’s a part two. I gave him my number before I left. ☺️",2,1747418001.0,u_agreeablepeachsorbet,1,1.0,False

# Luke Munoz cheated.

# Vespera Gildon stood outside the president's office, her body stiff as if encased in ice. Her black stilettos seemed to merge with the dark marble floor beneath her.

# After a long pause, she finally raised her hand and knocked on the door.

# A deep, familiar voice responded from inside. ""Come in.""

Vespera tightened her grip on the documents in her hand and pushed the door open with the other. As she stepped inside, she forced a faint smile onto her face and approached Luke.

""Are you busy? There are a few urgent documents that need your signature."" Even as Vespera asked, she had already placed the papers before him, flipping them open to the pages that required his signature.

Luke had just returned from a business trip to Shawford earlier that morning. He had come straight to the office to tackle the mountain of work waiting for him. His desk was cluttered with files, and his handsome, well-defined face bore traces of exhaustion.

Without even glancing at the documents, he signed them quickly. ""Thanks for your hard work.""

Vespera gathered the signed papers and asked, ""Will you be home for dinner tonight?""

""I have plans tonight. You don't need to wait for me,"" he replied without looking up.

""Okay. I'll head out then."" Vespera turned and walked away, clutching the documents. As she did, her smile faded into a cold, mocking expression.

As Vespera passed the restroom in the office, a faint sound reached her ears. It seemed like a small animal jumping off the bed and landing on the floor.

Her gaze swept over the couch area, where a few snack wrappers and a half-finished milk tea lay on the coffee table. On the floor, a pastel pink high heel lay tipped over.

Everything became clear instantly. Her heart turned cold, crumbling into ash.

Vespera returned to her office. The short walk back drained all her energy. When she finally sat down, she let out a long, weary sigh.

She pulled one document from the stack in her hands. It was a divorce agreement.

Flipping to the last page, Vespera traced the lines of his signature with a mocking expression, her mind flashing back to memories.

Luke vowed to marry Vespera back then. However, Vespera's mother-in-law warned her not to get too comfortable, as no man could stay loyal to one woman forever.

Vespera was naive enough to believe they were different. But what difference was there?

Luke had cheated on her with a young woman. He was convinced he was hiding it well, indulging in the thrill of his affair. He had even brought her along on his business trip to Shawford. And now, he had brought her back to the office.

Vespera withdrew her finger and snapped a photo of the signed divorce agreement. She then sent it to her mother-in-law, Fiona Reeds, with a simple message. ""He signed it.""

A week ago, Vespera had struck a deal with Fiona. She demanded that Vespera initiate the divorce and keep their secret marriage hidden from the public. In return, Vespera had asked for a billion-dollar settlement.

In a month, Luke would be completely out of her life.

Just then, a knock on the door interrupted her thoughts.

After keeping the divorce agreement, Vespera said, ""Please enter.""

The door opened, and Luke's assistant, Osbert Madron, stepped inside.

""Ms. Gildon, Mr. Munoz asked me to pass this to you,"" Osbert said, placing a dark green velvet box in front of her.

Vespera casually opened the box and found an expensive diamond jewelry set. But the first thing that flashed through her mind was a dazed, short-haired girl in a bathrobe, carelessly holding up a diamond necklace. The room bathed in dim, suggestive lighting, the bed rumpled, and the girl's chest marked with unmistakable love bites.

A wave of nausea churned in her stomach.

""Thank you, Mr. Madron.""

Osbert felt a chill run down his spine when he saw Verspera's threatening gaze. He couldn't help but add, ""Mr. Munoz personally selected this. It's one of a kind in the world.""

It's too bad that Luke's heart wasn't one of a kind; she no longer wanted it.

Vespera smiled faintly. ""Really? How touching that he found time in his busy schedule to buy me a gift.""

Something in her voice didn't quite align. Osbert's unease deepened as he broke into a cold sweat. Did she know about Luke and Tina Sowle? He mumbled an excuse and fled from the office.

Vespera looked at the jewelry on the desk with disdain, as if it were filthy. She took out her phone, snapped a photo, and sent it to the owner of a luxury resale shop.

Then, she instructed, ""Sell this for me and donate the proceeds to the Foundation for Children with Intellectual Disabilities.""

The resale shop owner was speechless.

…

At 5:00 pm, Vespera had just reached her car and was about to open the door when her gaze casually swept across the parking garage. She noticed a car idling diagonally across from her.

Through the window, she saw Luke in the backseat, a short-haired woman nestled close to him. The woman had a round, cute face and radiated youthful energy.

""Mr. Munoz!"" Osbert gasped, slamming on the brakes.

Separated by glass and a stretch of space, Vespera's eyes found Luke's.

Chapter 2

Luke's eyes were dark and unreadable, while Vespera's were lifeless, devoid of emotion.

The atmosphere in the garage was tense.

Despite noticing Verspera, the woman didn't bother to distance herself from Luke. Instead, she grew even bolder, wrapping her arms around his neck and whispering something into his ear.

Vespera felt disgusted by the scene. She looked away, got into her car, and drove off without glancing back.

…

Shortly after arriving home, Vespera heard the sound of another car pulling up outside.

As she reached up to unfasten the clasp of her necklace before the glass cabinet in the walk-in closet, a towering presence loomed behind her. The man's commanding presence filled the small space, completely enveloping her.

His hands pressed against the glass cabinet, angling himself to study her face from the side. ""Are you angry?""

Vespera avoided his gaze. She took her time putting the necklace away before replying indifferently, ""I'm angry enough to kill. You'd better watch your back.""

Luke fell silent for a moment before speaking again. ""The Sowle family is interested in collaborating with us on the Polaris project. I've been in talks with Austin Sowle, their eldest son. That woman is his sister, Tina Sowle.""

""So if you don't entertain his sister, he won't work with you?""

""Vespera, I'm trying to explain. Don't be sarcastic.""

""I don't think it's necessary to explain."" Vespera finally turned to look at Luke. Her gaze seemed to pierce his soul. ""Luke, if you're tired of me and want to replace me as the lady of this house, I can step aside.""

Luke's expression darkened instantly. ""What did you say?""

She sighed and replied, ""We can get a divorce.""

As Vespera tried to push him away and leave, Luke yanked her back forcefully. Then, he gripped her face and warned, ""Don't even think about it.""

Vespera didn't respond. Not only had she thought about it—she had already taken action. She didn't want to be with him anymore.

Luke stayed home until late that night—until an unexpected phone call summoned him away. Vespera caught the faint sound of a tearful voice on the other end of the line.

…

The next morning, Vespera's lawyer and close friend, Rebecca Snyder, who was handling her divorce, sent her a screenshot. It was a new post from Luke's girlfriend—a photo of two hands, one noticeably larger than the other, forming a heart against a scenic sunrise. The caption read, ""When love greets the day"".

Vespera recognized the larger hand instantly—it was Luke's. She sat frozen, her fingers curled around a glass of water. She wasn't sure how long she had been gripping it.

The sharp, clear sound of the cup hitting the surface triggered a feeling of loss in Vespera. It was as if something within her had broken too.

Days passed, and Luke never returned home. Their only encounters were in company meetings—him at the head of the table, her among the executives. They didn't look at each other, and Vespera never once went to find him at his office either.

Instead, she filled her time searching for apartments and methodically discarding every gift he had ever given her—anniversary presents, birthday gifts, Valentine's Day tokens, wedding mementos. She even sold her wedding ring.

Why hold onto reminders of a love she no longer wanted?

…

That evening, Elena Hortwall, the lady boss of Westfield Group, invited Vespera to join her at a club.

At first, Vespera hesitated—it was already close to eleven—but after some thought, she decided to go.

Now that she was divorced and would be leaving Eclipse Group, she would need connections for her business ventures.

As soon as she stepped into the club, she spotted Elena.

""I could have gone up by myself. You didn't have to come down,"" Vespera said.

Elena linked arms with her affectionately as they stepped into the elevator. ""I was worried you'd get lost. You've never been here before, have you?""

That was true. She hadn't.

The two headed upstairs, and Elena led Vespera into a spacious private room. A large screen stood in the center, dividing the space.

As they entered, Vespera noticed a few people on the other side of the screen, but Elena didn't take her there. Instead, she led her to a quieter section with only one other person. That person looked vaguely familiar, possibly the girlfriend of one of Luke's friends.

The woman seemed to recognize Vespera too. Though she looked slightly uneasy, she still managed a polite smile.

After Vespera removed her coat and sat down, Elena left.

Vespera lifted the drink given to her, taking a slow sip. From beyond the screen, the cheerful sounds of conversations drifted over—until suddenly, her name was mentioned.

""Luke doesn't bring Vespera to our gatherings anymore.""

""Of course not. Ms. Sowle is young and adorable. He takes her everywhere now, like she's the center of his universe.""

""Guess Luke finally changed his taste after all these years.""

""No matter how beautiful Vespera is, eight years in bed with the same woman? He must be bored out of his mind.""

""She's such a fool. After all that time with Luke, she was just a placeholder. Hey, if he doesn't want her anymore, maybe I should take a shot. I've had my eye on that waist of hers for years.""

…

Vespera's gaze turned ice-cold. She recognized two of the voices; they were friends of Luke, men who had always addressed her as Mrs. Munoz with excessive sweetness.

The woman beside her looked mortified, unwilling to meet her gaze. When Vespera rose from her seat, she assumed she was about to flee in embarrassment.

But Vespera did no such thing. Instead, she cleared her throat, picked up her drink, and strolled leisurely to the other side of the screen.

She leaned against it, tilting her head as she addressed the group in an easy, conversational tone. ""Just so we're all on the same page—when Luke and I first got together, he was an inexperienced virgin. So really, wasn't I the one who got to use him for eight years for free?""

The room fell silent. Every face on the couch stiffened in utter disbelief.

And before anyone could recover, two tall figures stepped into the room.

The group stiffened further, eyes darting between Vespera and the men standing behind her, dread settling deep in their bones.

Chapter 3

Luke stood behind Vespera, his presence exuding an icy chill.

Sensing the shift in the room, Vespera glanced over her shoulder. So, he had been here all along.

She quickly turned back, her gaze landing on the short-haired woman sitting in the corner of the couch. Earlier, Tina had been lounging smugly, one leg crossed over the other, absentmindedly twirling her hair around her finger.

But now, her expression had completely soured. Her smile was gone, replaced by a murderous glare.

It was clear Luke and Tina had been meeting up with the rest. Judging by their friends' casual tone, this wasn't just a one-time occurrence—it had happened enough times that they no longer bothered to hide it.

Luke took a step forward. The group, as if suddenly released from paralysis, sprang into action.

""We're sorry! We were just talking nonsense.""

""Mrs. Munoz, nothing is going on between Luke and Ms. Sowle!""

""Mrs. Munoz, please don't take it seriously.""

Luke grabbed Vespera's wrist, intent on dragging her away. But before he could, she turned and threw her drink straight into his face.

The room fell into a dead silence. Everyone watched, their scalps tingling. Did she really just do that?

Then, Vespera flashed a wide smile and said, ""Enjoy your time with your sweetheart. I wouldn't want to spoil the fun.""

She lowered her head, attempting to pry his fingers off her wrist.

Luke's expression darkened. Without a word, he scooped her up, slung her over his shoulder, and strode out.

The room fell silent.

Out in the hallway, Vespera struggled fiercely against his hold. Just then, the elevator doors slid open.

As Luke stepped inside and turned around, her eyes were drawn to the sleek black leather shoes, the straight legs clad in tailored black suit pants, and the pale, slender hands resting at his sides. His fingers were long and elegant.

The atmosphere was thick with silence and unease.

As they exited the elevator, Vespera couldn't resist looking up. She saw a pair of deep, piercing eyes staring down at her.

Vespera was speechless as she lowered her head, covering her face.

Outside the club, Luke tossed her into the car's back seat before getting in himself.

Dizzy and disoriented, Vespera sat up. After being upside down for so long and then thrown into the car, she felt like she might have a concussion.

Luke pulled a wet wipe from the car's compartment and began wiping his face.

Out of the corner of her eye, Vespera caught a glimpse of something behind the tissue box—it looked like a condom.

Before she could say anything, Luke demanded, ""Why did you come here? To catch me cheating?""

Disgusted, she reached for the door handle, ready to get out. The car was filthy.

""Vespera!"" Luke yanked her back inside, his voice filled with irritation. ""Where do you think you're going? Are you done yet?""

Her breathing was unsteady. She pressed her fingertips and murmured, ""I want to go home.""

Luke called Osbert, who was waiting outside the club, and told him to drive.

The ride was silent. Vespera sat as far from Luke as possible, her complexion pale as if she might throw up at any moment.

When they finally arrived home, she wasted no time getting out of the car.

Vespera hurried to the kitchen and gulped a full glass of ice-cold water. Finally, she felt slightly better.

When she returned to the living room, Luke was already seated. She walked over and sat down as well. Another suffocating silence stretched between them.

Finally, Luke spoke. ""I was there to discuss a project. You stormed into the club and made a scene. I'm so humiliated. Do you have any idea how foolish, how repulsive you looked? You behaved like a shrew.""

""Okay. Anything else?"" Vespera asked calmly.

""If you still want this relationship to last, stop these unnecessary suspicions. I don't have time to cater to your emotions.""

""Alright. Anything else?""

Luke frowned and replied, ""Do you have any idea how annoying you are right now?""

Vespera smiled faintly as she stood up. Soon, he won't have to be annoyed anymore. With that, she turned and headed upstairs.

Luke's irritation grew at her smile. After sitting in the living room for a while, he went upstairs to their bedroom, only to find that she had already gone to bed. He showered and lay down beside her.

In the darkness, Vespera turned away from him, shifting toward the edge of the bed to avoid any contact.

Luke turned and embraced her, forcefully pulling her from the edge into his arms. His movements tinged with anger.

His tall, strong frame easily overpowered her, holding her so tightly she couldn't move. So, she spent the night rigid in his embrace.

The next morning, Vespera only prepared breakfast for herself. When Luke went downstairs, he found her eating bread alone. As he was about to leave, he changed directions and approached the dining area.

Leaning close to her ear, he said gently, ""Let's go out to the sea this weekend, just the two of us.""

Vespera hummed in response while drinking her milk. Unsurprisingly, the day before the weekend, he canceled on her again, saying he needed to fly to Holsword.

Vespera felt nothing. Perhaps Luke hadn't even realized how long it had been since they last shared a meal or truly spent time together. He warned her against entertaining thoughts of divorce, yet in reality, he treated her like she was invisible, as if it made no difference whether she was there or not.

That weekend, Vespera packed the books from her shelf and moved them to her new home. As she was arranging them, her phone rang. It was her mother-in-law, Felicia Jensen.

Vespera answered and politely said, ""Hello, Mrs. Munoz.""

Felicia's voice carried its usual condescension. ""Come over. We need to finalize the document we discussed earlier.""

""Is that really necessary?""

""It is if I say so.""

""Okay. I'll come by this afternoon.""

""No, come at noon.""

""Fine.""

Vespera agreed, as she had no other plans.

Meanwhile, Felicia stood by the window, watching with satisfaction as Luke and Tina strolled in the garden. She wanted Vespera to see what a truly perfect couple looked like.

Chapter 4

Vespera arrived at the Munoz residence at 11:40 am.

The butler, Walter Osland, was visibly startled to see her. He knew another guest was expected today but hadn't realized it would be Vespera. His forehead broke into a cold sweat at the thought of Luke and Tina in the living room.

Very few people knew about Vespera and Luke's marriage. Aside from their parents, only a handful of close aides, including Osbert and Walter, were aware of the truth.

""This way."" Walter had no choice but to follow Felicia's instructions. He braced himself as he led Vespera inside.

Before they reached the living room, a sweet, affectionate voice rang out. ""I won again. Luke, were you letting me win on purpose?""

Vespera stopped in her tracks. Her mind suddenly went blank. Then, everything became crystal clear.

She couldn't help but let out a cold laugh before entering the living room.

Vespera had been shifting her books earlier, so she hadn't bothered with makeup today. She was dressed casually in a loose white shirt and jeans. Her long hair was gathered into a loose ponytail with a simple ribbon.

Yet, even in such an understated look, her skin remained fair, and her dark eyes were striking against the natural redness of her lips. A few stray strands of hair fell against her cheek, adding an unintentional touch of allure to her beauty.

Luke was taken aback to see Vespera. ""Why are you—""

""Your mom called me over,"" Vespera interrupted coolly. She glared at Luke and continued, ""Weren't you supposed to be in Holsword? When did you learn to teleport?""

Luke was at a loss for words as a flicker of guilt flashed across his eyes.

Tina rose from the couch and walked up to Vespera, extending a hand with a provocative smile.

""Hello, I'm Tina Sowle.""

Vespera didn't spare her a glance, treating her as if she were nothing more than air.

Just then, Felicia entered the living room. She cast a brief look at Vespera before affectionately holding Tina's hand. ""Did you have fun today? Make yourself at home.""

Then, she introduced Vespera. ""This is Ms. Vespera Gildon. She works at Eclipse Group. I asked her to come over for a discussion.""

Everyone knew Vespera was Luke's wife. Yet Felicia deliberately reduced her to nothing more than a company employee, making it clear she had no intention of acknowledging her as family. This also told Tina that Vespera was insignificant and didn't threaten Luke and Tina's impending marriage.

Tina lifted her chin proudly. ""Oh? She's just a company employee?""

Vespera didn't react to either of them. Instead, she turned her gaze to Luke and watched him in silence. She wanted to see how he would respond.

However, Luke merely sat there, his face as cold and indifferent as ever, making no effort to correct the insult.

Did he not understand what was happening? No. He understood perfectly. He just didn't care if she was humiliated.

Vespera turned to Felicia and said, ""Mrs. Munoz, didn't you call me here for a discussion? Let's just speak here.""

""We can discuss another day. Since you're already here, stay for lunch.""

""I won't be staying for lunch. I have other matters to attend to.""

With that, Vespera turned to leave.

Felicia bellowed, ""How can you show such disrespect when an elder invites you to a meal? Where are your manners?""

Vespera turned and looked at her. After a short pause, she said, ""Okay. I'll stay for lunch. Just don't regret it.""

Then, she walked over and chose a single-seat chair for herself.

Tina sat beside Luke and wrapped her arm around his. ""Let's continue our game.""

Luke pulled his arm away and looked at Vespera. ""Do you know how to play checkers, Ms. Gildon?""

Vespera glanced at the exquisite set on the table and quickly noticed the game strategy. It was such a simple setup, and yet Luke lost.

So, he did know how to humor someone. Just not her.

Vespera lifted her gaze and smirked at Luke. ""I do. Would you like to play, Ms. Sowle?""

Luke's expression darkened slightly, his gaze flashing with warning.

Tina confidently reset the board. ""White or black, Ms. Gildon?""

Vespera picked up a black piece and said, ""Black. Seems fitting for me.""

Luke was speechless, while Felicia and Tina were about to laugh at her self-deprecation—plenty of people got shaded, but few shaded themselves.

Yet, after a few seconds, they realized she wasn't mocking herself. She was mocking them.

Tina clenched her teeth and made the first move. Piece by piece, the game unfolded.

Felicia noticed how strategically Tina had placed her pieces while Vespera's moves seemed scattered and aimless. She was biased toward Tina, so she didn't analyze the game carefully.

Then, Felicia shot Luke a look. That was the difference between a well-bred lady from a prestigious family and a nobody. However, Luke showed no reaction.

The game continued, and each time Tina thought she was about to win, Vespera blocked her path. Her emotions fluctuated with each turn, and she grew increasingly impatient. Still, she reassured herself that the match would end in a draw even if she couldn't win. It was disgraceful to tie with Vespera, after all.

""Your move,"" Vespera said.

Tina had already placed three pieces in a hidden corner. If she could just add one more, victory was hers.

She feigned composure and made her move. Then, she anxiously watched and prayed that Vespera didn't notice.

When Vespera placed her next piece elsewhere, Tina declared triumphantly, ""I win!""

Felicia immediately applauded in delight. However, they soon watched in stunned silence as Vespera began calmly collecting the pieces. They noticed that she had already won the game.

Felicia and Tina went pale.

Chapter 5

Vespera collected the remaining two pieces.

The checkers game was supposed to be winner-takes-all, but Tina was unwilling to accept defeat. So, she decided to act shamelessly.

""Even though you won first, I also have five in a row now. So I win too."" She defiantly placed another piece on her row of four, claiming victory.

Vespera stared at Tina briefly as if she were a fool. ""Well, if that's the case, I guess I can keep going too.""

With that, she placed another piece on the board, easily completing another row of five.

Over the next minute, Vespera nearly cleared the board, blocking Tina at every turn until the latter couldn't make any move.

Tina's face turned red, then pale, and she demanded a rematch.

Second game, third game, fourth game...

Vespera either toyed with Tina, slowly crushing her spirit, or ended the game swiftly with precise, ruthless moves. Having been treated like a fool, Tina burst into tears.

""Enough!"" Luke snatched the game box from Vespera's hands with an icy expression.

Seeing Luke take her side, Tina threw herself into his arms, sobbing as if Vespera had bullied her.

Luke and Felicia comforted Tina. Then, the latter scolded Vespera, ""It's just a game of checkers. Why take it so seriously? You're so petty and competitive. It's clear you come from a poor family!""

The voices around Vespera blurred into a meaningless hum.

Luke's face, once so bright and radiant in her eyes, now seemed like a faded, distorted film reel, unrecognizable and dull.

Whatever. 20 more days. She'd let him do as he pleased.

Vespera tossed the remaining pieces onto the board, her expression bored and indifferent. She then stood up and walked away.

A few drops of blood fell onto the board as she scattered the pieces. It wasn't until she stepped outside and felt the coolness on her fingers that she realized she had been clenching her fists so tightly that her nails had dug into her palms, drawing blood.

""Vespera!"" Luke called after her, his voice finally tinged with a hint of panic.

He tried to chase after Vespera, but Tina clung to his waist, crying even harder.

Vespera left the Munoz residence. Her phone rang incessantly on the drive as Luke was calling her repeatedly. She blocked his number without hesitation.

Then, Vespera sent a message to Felicia. ""15 million dollars! If you short me even a single cent, I'll make sure you pay dearly for it!""

Felicia nearly had a heart attack when she read the message.

Vespera drove on, the world outside her window shifting as the sky darkened and rain began to fall. Her thoughts scattered like the raindrops, unfocused and drifting.

Suddenly, a flash of yellow zipped past her—a motorcycle swerved recklessly in front of her car. Her heart lurched, and she slammed on the brakes.

The next second, a loud crash jolted Vespera from behind. Her head snapped forward, hitting the steering wheel.

A sharp pain spread from her temple. When she looked up, the rain-soaked world outside was tinged with red. She grabbed a tissue and wiped the blood from her eyes.

Vespera had been rear-ended, and the yellow motorcycle that had cut her off was now nowhere to be seen.

Just then, someone tapped on her car window. Vespera rolled it down to find herself eye-to-eye with a man who appeared to be in his late 40s or early 50s. He was wearing glasses and carrying a sleek black umbrella.

Raymond Chandler's demeanor was calm and polite, his expression apologetic. ""Miss, I'm terribly sorry. I'm the one who collided with you. We'll take full responsibility. My boss is in a bit of a hurry right now, so could we exchange contact information? You can send us a list of damages later, and we'll make sure to cover everything.""

""Let's just wait for the police to handle it,"" Vespera replied flatly.

Vespera was already in a foul mood, and after being startled twice in quick succession, her frustration had reached its breaking point.

She got out of the car and walked to the rear, where she saw the back of her car dented from the collision with the Bentley behind her. Frowning, she took photos for evidence and called the police.

Seeing her insistence, Raymond didn't try to stop her. He returned to his car to report the situation. ""The lady isn't willing to settle privately. What should we do?""

The rain grew heavier. The windshield wipers pushed the rainwater aside, only for the glass to be quickly covered again by a fresh layer of mist.

Inside the car, a man lounged casually, his gaze fixed on Vespera, who was holding her forehead with one hand while talking on the phone.

She radiated intense frustration, her white shirt soaked through by the rain. Droplets clung to her long lashes before falling onto her red lips.

Raymond called out once again. ""Mr. Reid?""

Dominic Reid glanced at his watch before replying, ""Gerard is on his way. I'll leave first. You stay and handle this.""

""Understood.""

Vespera returned to her car. A short while later, the police arrived, followed by a silver Maybach.

The two cars stopped almost simultaneously.

She got out of her car. The occupants of the other car also stepped out.

Aside from Raymond, a tall, elegant figure emerged. His skin was pale, his deep eyes sharp and commanding. When he noticed her gaze, he glanced her way with a piercing look.

The man seemed familiar.

""Give this to her.""

Dominic handed Raymond the suit jacket, which was casually draped over his arm. He then got into the Maybach without a glance.

Raymond hurried over to Vespera with the jacket. ""Miss, your clothes are soaked. Please put this on.""

Vespera looked down and realized her white shirt was clinging to her body, almost revealing her undergarments.

Embarrassed, she accepted the jacket and slipped it on. ""Thank you.""

Raymond spoke quietly with the police officer while the Maybach slowly pulled away, cutting through the rain and disappearing into the mist. Vespera caught only a fleeting glimpse of the man's striking profile.

The jacket still carried its owner's warmth, and a faint, soothing sandalwood scent dispelled the chill of the rain.

The police concluded the matter, and both parties agreed to exchange contact information.

Raymond offered to accompany Vespera to the hospital to have her forehead injury checked, but she politely declined. By now, her mood had settled, and she apologized for her earlier overreaction, admitting it was due to her foul mood rather than their fault.

""I'll have the jacket cleaned and return it to you.""

Raymond didn't argue. He was familiar with Dominic's temperament; even if the jacket were returned, he likely wouldn't want it back. Still, he nodded politely.

Vespera went to the hospital alone.

…

Meanwhile, Luke, unable to reach her and with the rain pouring down, was plagued by terrifying thoughts.

Just then, he received news of her accident.

Hearing that made me **very uncomfortable** — the same feeling I used to get whenever someone asked me about my marks. I actually **scolded** my mom for this and told her not to do it anymore. I asked her, what does she gain by asking about other kids' marks? I thought she would understand me, but to my surprise, she got upset and said, ""It’s just a curiosity among ladies"" to know these things.

After a 30-minute back-and-forth between us, we somehow reached a point where I convinced her **never to ask about someone’s or someone’s children’s marks** — unless they bring it up themselves and want to share it.

1ko77i2,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ko77i2/looking_for_advice/,Looking for advice,"Hello all, 

I’m looking for a little advice from some of you who know far more about espresso than I do. A little background. I’m not a coffee snob, I’ll drink it pretty much however. That said, I’m not without my standards. Work coffee is generally a no go, and most of the local “artisan” coffee shops in my area really don’t make anything more than glorified “office coffee”. This leads me to my relationship with espresso. I’m not in the game of spending hundreds or thousands on espresso equipment, I have a few coffee brewing apparatuses at my disposal, but I’m more of a single malt or bourbon person than I am a coffee person. However, I do like the idea of enjoying the nuanced flavors and aromas of espresso. I recently spent a week abroad in the UK and while it’s not the coffee capital of the world by any means, I couldn’t help but notice that the coffee overall seemed better. But what stood out to me the most was an espresso I enjoyed one morning in a little breakfast place in Edinburgh named “The Edinburgh Larder”. I was too swept up in the moment to ask who the roaster was, but whatever black magic was in that cup has left me chasing the same flavor since I have come back to the states. Most espresso here is simply strong, bitter, and quite frankly unpalatable. But that cup, although it did have bitterness in the background, was different. If I could match the flavor profile to something, it had a pleasant acidity, very akin to a malt vinegar or HP sauce. As unappealing as that may sound, that’s what my untrained palate latched onto. I would also describe that it had something similar to tannins like a wine would, something that left me craving that next sip. 

In a nutshell, based on those two very limited details, can anyone tell me what exactly I’m chasing. Is that was espresso is supposed to taste like?

today she was sad cause another woman she knows told her that her kids also aren't so caring about her. for example her daughter doesn't help with cooking, drying out the clothes, cleaning the house, even calling her if she got late. well, that fits my description... but.. agh. she was sad about it, i could read it in her eyes. i do buy her gifts sometimes, took her out once for a coffee after she finally agreed, and try to be the nicest to her when she talks with me and stuff.

i do love my mother so much.. so much. i know all (at least all what she told me) about what she's been through and i never want to be a reason for her sadness.

for now, i mainly wanna spend time with her at home. but she kinda got used to being alone at home most of the times cuz i be studying all day (not really and she knows it).

thinking about it i do spend time playing video games or watching movies more than with her. but i also do not know what i can do with her at home; something she likes.

asking her what she likes to doing together is definitely not an option. she doesn't like it when i show love via words, she wants actions.

also, any other tips to turn into a better daughter are appreciated. thank you

# ""So, are you telling me that Lily ran in front of my car on purpose? That she couldn't handle the sudden change in her family circumstances and wanted to end it all?

# ""Back then, Lily was outstanding in both academics and character. Every boy in school saw her as their perfect dream girl. The day of her accident, the boys at school nearly beat me to death.""

# In the rented apartment, Marcus Blackwood stared vacantly at the woman sitting across from him. His face was unshaven, and he was surrounded by scattered beer bottles and takeout containers.

# The woman wearing smoky eye makeup was Victoria Reed, his high school classmate.

Victoria looked around the room that was permeated with an atmosphere of despair and decay, frowning. ""Lily and I were deskmates in high school. Her family situation was very complicated. She even wrote a letter before the accident.""

Marcus took the yellowed envelope Victoria handed him, suddenly losing emotional control as he covered his face and sobbed. ""So, it wasn't me who ruined her life—she ruined mine.""

The sealed memories gradually surfaced in his mind.

During the summer break of junior year, 18-year-old Marcus became obsessed with driving. He pestered his parents to enroll him in driving school, and he obtained his license within a month.

At first, his family was concerned, so his father, Robert Blackwood, always sat in the passenger seat whenever Marcus drove.

He remembered that day—the day before senior year started. His family's café was running low on supplies. His father had a business engagement, so Marcus volunteered to deliver the goods using the family car.

In his haste, Marcus didn't hit the brakes early as Robert had taught him when the traffic light was about to switch to yellow in three seconds, but instead pressed down on the accelerator.

Just then, a figure suddenly rushed out from the sidewalk, and Marcus couldn't remember anything after that. The only thing he recalled was the sea of red everywhere—blood that stained the street.

When he regained consciousness, he was already in the hospital. He learned that the person his car had hit was Lily Summers, his classmate.

In that moment, 18-year-old Marcus felt his heart fill with terror and remorse.

For 20 years, Marcus believed that his decision to step on the gas had destroyed Lily's life. Every night, he would have the same dream—a blood-covered woman singing to him, her voice wretched and her face terrifying.

Marcus' heart felt like it was being twisted by a knife, day after day. But now, the letter in his hand clearly told him that even without him, Lily would have chosen another car to end her life.

Marcus looked painfully at Victoria sitting across from him.

When freshman year began, Victoria and Marcus had been deskmates. Back then, Victoria was the class belle, and like many guys, Marcus secretly had feelings for her. He even wrote her love letters.

After Lily's accident, Marcus fell into depression and ruin. During that time, Victoria was the only one who comforted him.

Marcus mistook her comfort for true love and fell into desperate devotion. For 20 years, he worshipped Victoria without boundaries, giving everything he had, only to receive her inconsistent affection in return—warm one moment, but cold the next.

Across from him, Victoria turned her head to look out the window. ""You can start a new life now. Don't come looking for me anymore. I've found someone I care about.""

So, she had known all along that Lily had wanted to end her life, but she had chosen to hide the truth to enjoy his unwavering devotion. At that moment, Marcus felt his world spinning.

He thought that if he could do it all over again, he would surely shake some sense into the woman who had ruined his entire life.

Lily Summers…

…

""Marcus, get up! The store needs supplies, and your dad's not around. Hey brat, are you listening?""

In a room bathed in sunlight, Marcus opened his eyes to a world spinning violently. The ceiling and floor wildly alternated, each movement triggering waves of nausea.

Fighting the churning in his stomach, Marcus shakily rose to his feet and found himself in a room simultaneously familiar and foreign.

A young, bewildered face stared back at him in the mirror. Basketball posters covered the wall above his bed. Then, there was his cherished guitar that was not yet consigned to flames.

A bewildering thought seized his mind. He grabbed the Nokia phone from his nightstand and checked the date.

It was 20 years ago. The date was August 30th. Had he truly returned?

His heart, which had been dormant for 20 years, thundered in his chest as he shook uncontrollably. Today was the day both his and Lily's fates would be irrevocably altered.

One was living with a dead soul, while the other was physically gone, yet eternally haunting another's dreams.

Marcus had endured this suffering once. He refused to let it happen again.

He would break free from the nightmare that had tormented him for two decades. This time, he would personally pull that suicidal young woman away from the wheels of his car.

He pushed open the door to find his mother, Milly Fulton, on the phone in the living room. When she saw Marcus, the elegant-looking woman said to the person on the other end, ""Mr. Wright, Rob's in a meeting. I'll have Mark deliver the supplies to you…

""Hey, you big goof, aren't you too old for hugs? …Alright, alright. Mr. Wright, we'll leave it at that.""

As Milly hung up the phone, she looked at Marcus, who had thrown himself into her arms, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. ""Let me tell you, puppy dog eyes won't work. Your father's not here—if you don't make this delivery, what is our family supposed to live on? Thin air?""

Looking at Milly—her hair not yet grayed from years of worrying about him—Marcus felt a surge of emotion. ""Mom, don't worry. I'll take care of you from now on.""

Milly somewhat playfully pushed Marcus away and handed him a set of keys. ""Charm won't get you out of this one, you brat. You still need to make the delivery. Since your dad isn't around, there's no car for you—take the scooter instead.""

In his previous life, Marcus had wheedled and insisted until Milly, pressured by the store's urgent needs, finally let him take the car.

This time, she watched with surprise as Marcus grabbed the scooter keys without protest and bolted out the door.

""Strange... The brat didn't even try to take the car.""

…

The electric scooter whizzed through the crowded streets. After the accident, Marcus had never driven again and developed a severe fear of blood.

For 20 years, the same nightmare visited him nightly. The woman in red was always Lily, though he could never make out her face clearly.

In his memory, Lily was distant and solitary. She kept to herself, with virtually no friends in class—Victoria being perhaps the closest thing she had to one.

She was so impossibly pale that the term ""deathly white"" barely described it.

What stuck with Marcus most was how she excelled in everything, always sitting in the front row in class and wearing that same washed-out uniform. Her beauty seemed almost otherworldly, too perfect to be real.

Everyone in school placed her on a pedestal. She was their untouchable ideal, but few had the courage to actually approach her.

In high school, Marcus had been brash and loud, while Lily was painfully quiet. Without the incident, their lives might never have intersected.

The scooter couldn't match a car's speed, so Marcus pushed it to its limit, terrified of being too late again. When he reached the intersection by his family's café, everything looked normal. That momentarily calmed his nerves.

But before he could fully relax, he caught sight of a young woman with flowing hair walking dejectedly toward the street. Unlike the red dress from his nightmares, Lily wore a simple white shirt and jeans.

She had luminous, expressive eyes, a delicate nose, and soft pink lips. Her silky hair fell across her shoulders, gleaming like pearls in the sunlight.

Marcus couldn't help but think how unfair God had been—most people seemed carelessly molded, but Lily was clearly a masterpiece crafted with divine attention.

If beauty were currency, Lily would be wealthy beyond measure. She had the kind of beauty admired universally. Throughout the school, countless students worshipped her from afar.

Marcus was less than 50 feet from the intersection. He watched the light across the street turn from green to red, and cars began to move forward.

At that moment, Lily, who had been staring at the ground, suddenly lifted her face toward the sun. In the light, her skin seemed to glow with a gentle warmth, hazy like a vintage photograph with its soft yellow tones.

A breeze caught her hair, and she raised her hand to brush away the strands from her face, letting a single tear roll down her cheek. Then, as if gathering all her courage, she took a step forward.

Marcus' heart froze. He abandoned the scooter and sprinted toward her like a man possessed.

Chapter 2

Lily stood at the roadside, head bowed as tears slid down her face. Her internal struggle was evident. Her slightly trembling shoulders revealed the intense battle raging within her mind.

Passersby behind her had noticed her emotional distress. Some called out warnings, but this only hastened her steps forward.

In the final three seconds of the green light, the light in Lily's eyes was completely replaced by despair. She suddenly stepped forward, rushing toward the pickup truck speeding from the opposite direction.

Marcus abandoned the electric scooter and sprinted wildly, adrenaline making his senses extraordinarily sharp.

In the next moment, just before Lily could throw herself in front of the pickup truck, a large hand seized her wrist. Marcus yanked her backward with tremendous force, pulling her safely away from the oncoming vehicle.

The sharp wail of emergency brakes, accompanied by the harsh friction between tires and pavement, pierced their eardrums. The entire intersection instantly fell into chaos.

Lily let out a muffled groan as she fell to the roadside after getting pulled by the powerful force. The surrounding commotion and noise seemed to have nothing to do with her.

Her mouth was now slightly open. Her flawless face was completely drained of color due to tension and fear.

Marcus looked at her while breathing heavily. He felt no joy in having saved someone, nor relief in having escaped disaster. There was only resentment and pent-up frustration.

After all, his life had been turned upside down because of her for 20 whole years.

Feeling guilty for allowing him to drive, Milly had gone gray overnight. Robert sighed constantly at the sight of his dejected son. A once-happy family had completely lost its vitality.

And all of this was thanks to the young woman before him. To say he didn't pin any blame on her would be impossible.

""Thank you...""

Lily stood up, not even daring to look up to see who had saved her. She just wanted to escape as quickly as possible before things could spiral further out of control.

Marcus instinctively reached out. ""Hold it.""

He still had something to say.

Suddenly, Lily felt a strong force at the back of her head. Her scalp tightened sharply as her body involuntarily arched backward.

She instinctively reached back to feel what it was, and her fingertips touched a hand that wasn't her own. It was firmly gripping her ponytail.

In an instant, her eyes widened, and her cheeks quickly flushed red. She whipped her head around, glaring at the young man behind her. However, her tear-filled, indignant eyes were instantly full of terror.

It was only at this moment that she finally saw clearly—the person who had just saved her and was now holding her ponytail was none other than her classmate, Marcus.

""Can't you watch where you're going? Don't you know red from green? If you want to die, do it without endangering others...""

After a long screech of brakes, the still-shaken pickup driver cursed loudly as he walked toward them.

The light had still been green for three more seconds, giving the pickup truck plenty of time to pass through. The driver never expected someone would suddenly dash out from the roadside, heading straight for his vehicle.

He had come so close to causing a tragedy. This brush with disaster left him shouting in fear and anger. Meanwhile, the crowd parted around them as Marcus released Lily's ponytail.

Then, Marcus took a deep breath in full view of everyone. With resolute eyes, he raised his hand high and delivered a sharp slap across Lily's face.

The slap was so unexpected and shocking that everyone nearby froze in disbelief.

As Lily held her cheek in stunned silence, Marcus turned to the pickup driver and bowed deeply. He said with complete sincerity, ""Sir, I'm terribly sorry. My sister's not right in the head.

""She wasn't paying attention when crossing and nearly caused a disaster. I know we're completely at fault here. I apologize for the trouble we've caused you.""

The pickup driver was clearly stunned by Marcus' slap as well. He glanced at the deeply bowing Marcus, then at Lily, who stood cupping her cheek with tears streaming down her face, before waving his hand dismissively.

""Forget it. We're lucky nothing serious happened.""

With those words, the pickup driver put his arm around Marcus' shoulder and whispered something in his ear before waving goodbye and leaving.

Then, Marcus flexed his numbing wrist and approached Lily. He grabbed her arm and pulled her toward the café behind them.

The shock on Lily's face immediately transformed into fury as she shouted, ""What are you doing? Let go of me!""

As she yelled, she clawed at his fingers with such force that her nails turned white from the pressure. While Lily struggled desperately, Marcus raised his hand a second time. Lily held her cheek and stopped resisting after another crisp sound.

""Hey now, young man, why'd you hit her? How could you bring yourself to strike such a beautiful young woman?""

Just as an elderly man with a strong sense of justice was about to step forward, an older woman beside him immediately pulled him back.

""Don't get involved. I saw everything clearly. That young lady deliberately ran toward the pickup truck. She nearly caused a tragedy—someone needed to knock some sense into her...""

…

Marcus' family café had a staff lounge. He locked Lily inside, then turned to ask a server to collect his electric scooter and the scattered supplies.

When he finished and reopened the door, he found Lily standing by the window with a blank expression.

Her eyes were rimmed with red, her long lashes casting shadows below. Her pink lips were slightly parted, moist and glistening. Her dark hair fell in disarray around her shoulders.

As a breeze stirred the sheer curtains, Lily looked like a painting—beautiful enough to break hearts.

Marcus searched his pockets but found no cigarettes. He took a piece of candy from the fruit bowl and popped it into his mouth, mumbling, ""Do you think your head's made of steel or something?""

Lily touched her red, burning cheek and glared at Marcus.

Still, he showed her no sympathy. His next words drained the color from her face. ""If you're not harder than a pickup truck, why try to charge against one?""

Lily instinctively lowered her head, the anger in her eyes instantly replaced by fear. She stubbornly replied as she fought back tears, ""I didn't...""

""You didn't? So, were you just blind and couldn't see the traffic light?"" Marcus sat on the stool and extended his hand toward her. ""Hand it over.""

Strands of hair fell across Lily's forehead, hiding her flushed cheeks.

Marcus then slammed his hand on the table. He coldly demanded under Lily's startled gaze, ""The letter.""

Panic flashed across Lily's face. She instinctively pressed her hand against the pocket of her jeans and quickly stepped backward, shrinking against the window. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""

Her manner practically screamed guilty.

Marcus suddenly crushed the candy between his teeth. The crunching sound was jarringly loud in the quiet room.

He stood up and advanced toward Lily, who kept backing away, looking like a lamb awaiting slaughter.

Marcus quickly closed in, slamming his hand against the wall beside Lily's head, trapping her. Lily was dumbstruck.

She looked up to find Marcus' intense eyes staring down at her. This was her first time properly looking at him despite being classmates for two years.

Marcus was handsome and cocky. He had sharp, defined facial features, a straight nose, pale lips, and healthy, tanned skin. At six feet tall, he was among the tallest in their class.

Cornered against the wall with nowhere to retreat, Lily could only force herself to overcome her embarrassment and fear as she tilted her head up to meet his gaze. But she was easily flustered, and her delicate, fair neck soon flushed pink with nervousness.

Just as Lily was struggling not to cry, she suddenly felt a hand reach for her back pocket. ""What are you doing...""

For all her innate pride and standoffish demeanor that normally kept people at arm's length, Lily found herself completely vulnerable before Marcus. Her carefully constructed walls were crumbling.

When Marcus finally finished rummaging through her back pocket and pulled out nothing but a sanitary pad, Lily snapped back to reality and shoved him away forcefully.

Marcus was gradually reclaiming his teenage boldness. His eyes drifted briefly to the young woman's heaving chest as he wondered aloud, ""You haven't hidden the letter inside your clothes, have you?""

Chapter 3

""Don't push your luck, Marcus Blackwood!"" Lily instinctively covered her chest, flushing with anger and embarrassment. ""Tomorrow's the first day of school. I swear I'll tell our homeroom teacher you're harassing me!""

Even the perfect student with excellent grades and behavior could only use the teacher as a shield.

Marcus waved dismissively, then realized he was still holding the sanitary pad. He tossed it casually onto the coffee table.

""Go ahead. That would give me the perfect opportunity to discuss the contents of your letter with the teacher. Something about 'I'll leave as quietly as I came,' and 'if you don't love, please don't hurt...'""

""Shut up!"" Lily reacted like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, her head buzzing. She instinctively reached out and covered Marcus' mouth with her hand.

How was this possible? That farewell letter was her secret alone. Lily was certain she hadn't shown it to anyone. How could Marcus possibly know about it?

A flash of surprise crossed Marcus' eyes as he felt the soft hand against his lips. He hadn't expected such a strong reaction from Lily. She'd actually touched him.

Marcus wondered what would happen if he licked her palm. Would it break through her composure? Still, he shouldn't.

Though he wanted revenge for how she'd ruined 20 years of his life and wanted to make her suffer a bit, he wasn't that shameless. So, he kept his mouth firmly shut.

Lily came to her senses and realized how awkward the situation had become. She'd only wanted to stop Marcus from reading that embarrassing letter aloud.

But now, her hand was pressed firmly against his mouth, her fingers squeezing his cheeks from the pressure. Even so, Marcus hadn't struggled—he just stared directly at her.

Lily's eyes revealed her conflicted emotions as she clearly felt the warmth of Marcus' breath against her palm. She hastily pulled her hand away and asked defiantly, ""What exactly do you want?""

Marcus became unusually serious, his expression stern. ""Give me that letter. That will give me leverage over you, and I'll make the letter public if you ever try to test whether your head is harder than a pickup truck again.

""I'll let everyone in class—no, everyone in the world—see Lily Summers' inner thoughts.""

Lily was clearly suicidal. Marcus could save her today, but what about tomorrow? Or the day after?

He couldn't watch over her every moment. So, the letter would be his collateral to keep Lily from entertaining dangerous thoughts.

Lily grew surprisingly calm after hearing his demand. She turned her head to look at Marcus, her earlier panic and fear gone. ""The letter isn't on me.""

Marcus shook his head.

""Don't believe me? Search for yourself."" Lily tilted her head back, her body as rigid as a statue.

Marcus didn't hesitate. He'd already found only a sanitary pad in her back pocket, so he checked her other jean pockets, finding nothing but three dollars and 50 cents in change.

Lily kept her head raised as Marcus searched her pockets. Her reddened eyes glistened with unshed tears, but her stubborn nature wouldn't let them fall.

After his search, Marcus found nothing but softness and smoothness, along with some loose change. Where was it? Where was that farewell letter?

""What about your shirt pocket?""

Marcus was determined to find that letter. Otherwise, Lily in her red dress would continue haunting his dreams. He truly couldn't bear those nightmares any longer.

Seeing Marcus shift his gaze to her chest, Lily's beautiful face flashed with alarm as she instinctively crossed her arms.

Watching her long eyelashes flutter nervously, Marcus became convinced the letter was hidden in her clothes. He stepped back to give her space, confident he had her cornered.

""How I miss the world and the way the morning sun shines on me...""

""That's enough!"" Lily tried to escape reality by covering her ears. She felt she'd completely humiliated herself in front of Marcus.

How could she have written such a sappy, melodramatic letter? And now, Marcus knew about it.

Lily's face burned with embarrassment. After an intense internal struggle, she finally chose to surrender.

Her slender fingers slowly unbuttoned her blouse. As each button came undone, her long neck became visible, along with elegantly curved collarbones.

Marcus' gaze fixed on the slight hollow at the base of her throat. Lily was truly full of surprises.

""Here, since you wanted to see."" Lily tossed her shirt at Marcus, leaving her wearing only a small camisole that outlined her youthful, beautiful curves.

Marcus ignored her deer-in-headlights expression and her embarrassment. He carefully examined the faded shirt, confirmed there was nothing hidden in it, then turned his attention to her delicate camisole.

If Lily's icy aloofness served as her protective armor, then now, the vulnerable, delicate beauty beneath was finally revealed with that armor stripped away.

Her dark hair fell to her waist, and her skin was porcelain and alluring. Her slender waist seemed disproportionate to her chest, and the small camisole was stretched tight, as if it might burst open at any moment.

Marcus instinctively moved closer, catching a faint, subtle fragrance. He was certain this wasn't perfume. The scent was sweet, yet carried the freshness and softness of morning flowers touched by dew.

As Marcus unconsciously took a deep breath, Lily's voice came out as if squeezed between her teeth. ""I told you it's not here. Do you believe me now?""

Lily clenched her jaw, fighting back the tears that threatened to spill. She instinctively lowered her gaze, only to see that Marcus had stepped back.

He sat down in the chair and took another piece of candy. In his previous life, Marcus had been very repressed and developed a heavy smoking habit. Now, he could only substitute that habit with candy. The sweet flavor burst across his taste buds, easing some of his agitation.

Marcus reflected that he had suffered terribly because of Lily in his past life, which instinctively made him want revenge—hence the two slaps.

But with a soul approaching 40 years of age, he figured he'd collected enough interest already. There was no need to truly harm her beyond this point.

Lily must have her own sorrows and troubles, too. Otherwise, an 18-year-old young woman in the prime of her youth wouldn't contemplate ending her life.

Marcus grabbed a piece of candy and offered it to Lily, his eyes narrowing with a pleasant smile. ""Lily, when you have dark thoughts, try eating some candy. Candy is sweet, which can make your life seem less bitter.""

After a long silence, Lily finally spoke. ""This is actually chocolate, which is bitter.""

""Huh... you're right."" Marcus was speechless. ""Let me get you a different candy, then.""

But Lily snatched the chocolate from Marcus' hand, tore open the wrapper, and put it in her mouth. It was indeed bitter.

But after the bitterness faded, the sweetness of the chocolate lingered in her mouth. Lily suddenly felt much better.

She thought to herself that since Marcus somehow knew about her farewell letter that she'd never shown anyone, perhaps he truly was sent by heaven to save her.

At the same time, Marcus noticed the hair tie tied around Lily's wrist and froze momentarily.

Today probably wasn't her first attempt to test her head against a pickup truck. There must be scars under that hair tie, right?

Gosh… It seemed he needed to find that letter as soon as possible.

Chapter 4

The hair tie on Lily's wrist signaled to Marcus that saving her would definitely be a long and difficult journey. Even so, Marcus didn't expect one piece of chocolate to cause an instant epiphany in the beautiful Ice Queen.

Still, at least she was safe for today. Having been given this rare second chance at life, Marcus didn't want to live with any regrets.

So, after finishing his candy, he turned his attention back to Lily.

The delicate straps barely resting on her shoulders, the defined collarbones, the impressive curves, the fullness threatening to spill over, and the slender waist that looked like it could be encircled by his hands—none of these looked capable of hiding anything.

It seemed the letter truly wasn't on her person.

Marcus suddenly thought of Victoria. She had been the one who gave him the letter 20 years in the future. Could it be in her possession now?

Back then, Marcus had pined after Victoria just like many other admirers in their class. After Lily's accident, Victoria's slight show of concern had made him even more devoted to her.

Victoria knew that Marcus felt guilty about Lily. She knew the truth about Lily's suicidal thoughts, but she chose to conceal it to enjoy Marcus' devotion.

At that time, Marcus' family owned several cafés. Victoria often brought large groups of friends to visit, and Marcus would slavishly foot the bill for them without limits.

He'd give expensive gifts without blinking an eye, yet never earned Victoria's genuine affection. She simply kept him at arm's length, claiming it was a test of his devotion.

Even in university, Victoria went through boyfriend after boyfriend, but Marcus remained her backup option. Looking back on it now, Marcus only wanted to call himself an idiot.

Was he angry? Somewhat, but after experiencing so much, many things no longer mattered to him. Besides, he'd been given a fresh start. Everything could be made right.

With one last hope, Marcus shifted his gaze downward.

Lily immediately flushed bright red. ""You already checked my pants pockets.""

She showed little aversion, with no disgust or hatred in her eyes. As for her embarrassment, Marcus chose to ignore it.

Lily's low-rise jeans were faded from washing and hugged her shapely hips. Her legs were straight and long—not excessively slender, but perfectly proportioned. Neither too thin nor too full, they were balanced and athletic.

When searching her pockets earlier, Marcus had felt their softness and elasticity firsthand. Though the possibility seemed slim, Marcus held onto his last hope.

""Nothing in the pockets doesn't mean it couldn't be hidden inside the jeans themselves.""

Now, Lily was truly panicking. Though she saw Marcus as her lifeline and was willing to give him the letter, that didn't mean she had no boundaries. She'd already removed her shirt, but her jeans were absolutely out of the question.

Lily instinctively backed away, though there was nowhere to retreat with her back against the corner of the room.

Marcus noted the alarm in her eyes but pressed on indifferently. ""I'll give you two choices. Either let me check your jeans, or... write me a new farewell letter.""

Lily hesitated, but Marcus didn't give her time to think. He was glaring at her as he pretended to reach forward.

She immediately yielded. ""I'll write it...""

Marcus' hand came within a fraction of an inch of those sweet-looking legs. He'd hoped she might hold out just a little longer, but alas…

Marcus turned to find a piece of paper and a pen after reluctantly withdrawing his hand.

Lily pointed at her belongings on the table, her voice carrying a hint of pleading. ""My things... Can I have them back?""

Marcus glanced at the three dollars and 50 cents and cheap sanitary pads on the table, dismissing her request with a wave. ""After you write the letter for me.""

There was no paper in the lounge, so Marcus had to go outside to find some. When he returned, he was carrying a cup of coffee and a slice of cake.

Seeing Lily still standing by the window, Marcus raised an eyebrow as he asked, ""Why are you standing so far away? Come over and write the letter.""

Lily had put her shirt back on. Her beautiful eyes instinctively glanced at the cake before she slowly moved to sit down.

Marcus handed her the paper and pen, adding cautiously, ""Just so you know, I'm completely familiar with the letter's contents. If you try to write something different, don't blame me for being unpleasant.""

Lily kept her head down but didn't start writing.

Marcus sat nearby, waiting patiently. One minute passed, then two. His patience gradually wore thin as his fingers drummed on the table.

Finally, he couldn't hold back. ""Do you not want to write? Then I'll have to search you.""

As he spoke, Marcus slowly moved his hand toward her thigh.

His movement was deliberately slow, giving her time to react, but Lily remained motionless. Even when Marcus placed his hand on her soft thigh, Lily kept her head down. Her delicate face was hidden by her hair, making her expression unreadable but appearing terribly vulnerable.

Just as Marcus began to think he'd gone too far, Lily slowly raised her head. Two drops of tears fell from her eyes like pearls. ""I can't remember how the first sentence goes...""

Lily was crying. She hadn't cried earlier when facing death on the street, or even when Marcus had slapped her twice in public.

But now, the tears came simply because she couldn't remember the first line of her farewell letter.

She hadn't cried earlier because she'd lost all hope for living. Now, having finally gathered the courage to go on living, she couldn't remember what she'd written.

Marcus placed the cake in front of her, smiling brightly. ""Remember what I said? When life is bitter, something sweet makes it less so.""

Lily lowered her head, her voice barely audible. ""This is all the money I have. I can't afford cake...""

Marcus ignored her protest and deliberately smeared a bit of frosting on her lips. ""Now it's on you. If you don't eat it, it'll just go to waste.""

When Lily saw Marcus actually moving to throw the cake in the trash, she hurriedly grabbed his hand and took a bite. It truly was sweet.

Marcus took the paper and pen from in front of Lily and began writing himself. Though he'd only seen the letter once, it seemed etched into his soul. Even if Lily couldn't remember, he wouldn't forget a single punctuation mark.

By the time Lily finished her cake, Marcus had completed the lengthy letter. He handed the finished letter to Lily, saying casually, ""Sign your name. From now on, this letter is yours.""

Lily took the letter and stared at the neat, elegant handwriting on the page, momentarily showing an expression of disbelief. It wasn't just that the content matched exactly what she'd written, but more importantly, the handwriting was 90% similar to her own.

If she hadn't been the author herself, most people would never have noticed the difference.

Little did she know that during the 20 years after the accident, Marcus had lived in nightmares, wanting to make amends and understand everything about Lily. He even began practicing her handwriting.

While Lily was shocked by the handwriting on the page, Marcus focused on the corner of her mouth. Earlier, he had deliberately smeared cake frosting there, and it hadn't been wiped away.

So Marcus reached out, his fingertip gently brushing across the corner of her mouth. Then, looking at the small bit of cream on his fingertip, he put it directly in his mouth. It was indeed sweet.

At that moment, Lily carefully handed the letter that now bore her signature to Marcus.

The letter read, ""Dear Mom, by the time you read this letter, I may no longer be by your side.

""How I cherish this world and the first rays of morning sunlight on my face. Don't grieve for too long. I've only gone ahead to a distant place, where there is no pain and no worries. Quietly, I leave, just as I quietly came...

""August 25th, 2005. From your loving daughter, Lily.""

Marcus solemnly folded the letter and carefully tucked it away. He looked at the young woman before him. ""Lily Summers, I have leverage over you from now on. You can't escape.""

Chapter 5

""Can I go now?"" Lily's delicate face bore a clear handprint. Not wanting anyone to see it, she kept her head down, using her long hair to hide half her face.

Marcus was still concerned. He worried that Lily might not show up at school tomorrow, which would defeat much of the purpose of his second chance at life.

He took out the letter again and said menacingly, ""Listen, don't get any bold ideas. If you don't come to school tomorrow, I'll read this letter at the school assembly. You know I'd do it.""

Lily paused for a moment, but showed no anger or resentment. She simply nodded gently. ""I'll do as you say.""

Only then was Marcus satisfied.

At this point, Lily carefully collected her three dollars and 50 cents along with the sanitary pad from the table. As she brushed past Marcus, he suddenly grabbed her hand.

Thinking that Marcus wanted to search her again, Lily hastily backed away. Her large eyes blinked pitifully.

Marcus simply said, ""Are you leaving just like that? You haven't paid for the coffee and cake yet.""

Lily glanced at the steaming coffee and the cream cake she'd eaten, arguing reasonably, ""I didn't drink the coffee.""

After a pause, she added, ""And you made me eat the cake.""

Marcus scowled. ""You ate it just because I told you to? If I told you to jump off a cliff, would you do that too? No excuses. The cake is 15 dollars. You have 3.50, right? You still owe me 11 dollars and 50 cents.""

Marcus rudely snatched the money from her hand, not sparing even the sanitary pad. ""I'll count the pad as one dollar. You still owe me ten dollars and 50 cents.""

Lily bit her red lips, glaring fiercely at Marcus. Those three dollars and 50 cents were money for food for two days. Her stomach was full after eating the cake, so at worst, she'd skip a few meals for a couple of days.

But that sanitary pad… Her period was due in two days, and she truly had no money to buy a new one.

Watching Lily's utterly unthreatening expression, Marcus found her quite adorable. He couldn't resist teasing her.

So, he took out the letter again and said casually, ""Write me an IOU. You can pay me back when you have the money.""

Marcus picked up the pen and quickly wrote on the letter, still imitating Lily's handwriting.

When Lily saw the amount on the IOU, she immediately exclaimed with indignation, ""Marcus, you're going too far! I only owe you ten dollars and 50 cents, but you wrote 150 dollars! You... you...""

Her cheeks instantly flushed crimson, her eyes filled with flames, and her chest heaved dramatically. Then she stomped her foot and shouted, ""Tomorrow, I'm telling our teacher that you're bullying me!""

Her voice carried a hint of tears.

Marcus noticed Lily was particularly sensitive about money. She hadn't reacted this strongly even when he'd searched her entire body. This gave him the additional impression that she was a penny-pincher.

Of course, Marcus also knew that Lily truly had no money. So, he made a show of looking at the paper again and raised an eyebrow.

""You're right, I did write it wrong. I'm too lazy to fix it, though. How about this—I'll give you 140 dollars, so then you'll actually owe me 150. What do you think?""

Marcus' family owned several café branches, so he wasn't short on money. Otherwise, he wouldn't have developed such a brash personality in high school.

He pulled two hundred-dollar bills from his pocket and handed them to her impatiently. ""I don't have any change. Keep the extra as compensation.""

Lily tilted her head slightly, looking directly at Marcus. Something crossed her mind, and a spark of life suddenly danced in her bright eyes.

She took in his handsome features, and her face bloomed like a flower. There was even a faint blush spreading from her cheeks all the way to her ears.

When she noticed Marcus looking back at her, she hastily averted her gaze, the bashful redness growing more intense.

Marcus had imagined this moment countless times. He often wondered what would have happened if he hadn't pressed on the accelerator that day. How wonderful it would be if Lily could have lived.

Marcus had investigated Lily's family situation and knew her father had died early, leaving her mother to raise her in difficult circumstances. He had thought countless times about helping Lily through her hardships, willing to give her an entire café if necessary, though his family might not have agreed.

Today, he finally got his wish.

In this moment, Marcus felt clarity of mind, and even 20 years of resentment dissipated considerably. His lips curved into a brilliant smile, and he was almost happy enough to break into song.

Lily noticed Marcus' sparkling eyes and instantly understood his intentions. She became even more certain that Marcus was sent by the heavens to save her. Suddenly, she felt that the world wasn't as terrible as she had imagined.

When they walked out of the café, the sunshine above was perfect. Lily left with her head down, but Marcus grabbed her wrist again.",1,1747417780.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

I don't have insurance (US) so I've tried managing it at home but I finally went to a clinic I have access to through my husband's job. She said she sees no indication of a kidney stone because there was no blood or protein in my urine sample. But the thing is my urine was very clear, despite my attempt to not over hydrate and dilute it. She basically said I would need a CT scan if I wanted to rule out kidney stones. 

I brought up about my pee being clear and she said yeah it's true it could be too diluted so I said ok I'll go in the morning and get it retested and she agreed. 

She said since I am having symptoms, if it is kidney stones they are big enough that it is causing a blockage and that it needs to be taken care of ASAP due to damaging the kidney. 

I saw online that you can get an xray for kidney stones so I'm assuming that would be less expensive than a CT? If that's possible I'm not sure why she didn't mention it. 

I'm not seeking medical advice but can anyone just let me know if all this sounds normal? I'm starting to wonder if I should just go to the ER, I don't want to risk damage.

———

Rhik hadn't been thinking right last night.

He'd forgotten his coffee. He'd been studying (trying to, anyway) too late at the library. He'd, apparently, taken several steps too many down the building's dizzyingly-patterned carpet, somehow unlocked a door that *wasn't his*, and still ended up in his apartment.

That should not have happened.

And yet, just as he was about to leave for classes, he couldn't help but notice that the little sign outside his room read *206*, not *202*.

He would have tried to play it off as some sort of demented April Fool's joke—haha, switch up all the room numbers for a day, very funny—but not only were the owners of Hilbert's Habitationals very unlikely to pull something like that, it was also the middle of September.

He tried to see if there was a way to pull the placard off its post; no luck. The apartment he'd slept in last night—*his* apartment—had somehow either switched numbers or switched his memory *of* the numbers.

No, no. He was scaring himself. Surely there was some explanation for whatever the hell this was. Maybe he'd had a minor stroke that only messed with his memories of his room number. Maybe he had early-onset Alzheimer's and this was the first sign.

Wait, no, that was worse.

The building was probably just doing renovations or something. It was fine. This was fine.

He shouldered his backpack and made for the stairs.

———

*This is not fine*, Rhik thought that evening, fingers still on the keys he'd hastily jammed into the lock.

He'd managed to forget about the whole number thing—managed to convince himself that *that 206 you saw was just a trick of the light, you probably just dreamed it*.

In fact, he'd forgotten about it so well that he'd opened the door that said *202* on it and—

This was his apartment.

What?

He blinked. Maybe the numbers had just been switched back while he was out.

*But just in case...*

He pulled his key out of the lock, walked over to apartment number 206, and unlocked the door.

First of all, that was neither how keys nor locks worked, and he was fairly certain that Hilbert did not trust him enough to give him a skeleton key to the entire building.

Second of all, this was *also* his apartment.

*What?*

The coat hangers, the shoe rack, the garishly ugly rug he hadn't found the time to replace—they were all the same.

He walked inside and turned the light on—*just to be sure*—and it truly was his living room. Even as sparsely furnished as it was, he could still recognize the spotted yellow of the tablecloth, the ever-so-slight angle the hanging pictures kept tilting at. The slowly-dying potted plants in the kitchen, the mountain of textbooks piled on the desk in his bedroom—there were somehow two copies of his apartment in the building.

How was that even possible?

*Okay*, said the part of his brain that still remembered how to use the scientific method. *Okay, time to test some things.*

He went along with this plan. It was the only thing keeping him from spiraling into a panic attack.

———

A list of things Rhik had found out about his goddamned apartment building:

One: Leaving an item in one room would also put it in the other. Same for taking items out, disappointingly. If he was stuck in some horror movie, he should at least get to break the laws of thermodynamics while he was at it.

Two: Every single door in the building led to his exact apartment. He'd taken photos of all the rooms, and the lighting stayed the same even if he went into a differently-facing residence. So there were no copies of his apartment at all—it just had many, many entrances.

Three: There were, seemingly, no other tenants in the entire complex. Rhik was embarrassed he hadn't noticed it sooner—he'd always been busy with classes or work or some such. But he hadn't seen even a trace of his neighbors ever since he'd moved in.

A shame. It would've been nice to have someone to keep him from going insane.

Oh, wait! The front desk worker!

Rhik made his way down the stairs (they always seemed a little longer than they should have been) and into the little lobby at the building's entrance.

""Hello,"" he said to the woman behind the counter—*Sophie*, her name tag read—who managed to look up from her computer without changing her blandly disinterested expression at all.

""What's the matter?""

""I'm Rhik,"" he started. ""I'm—well, I'm supposed to be in 202, but I think I'm technically in *every* room?""

Sophie blinked at him, and he had just realized how foolish that had sounded when she sighed and said, ""Finally figured it out, have you?""

""What?""

""The complex's been like this since you moved in,"" she continued. ""How'd you not realize it sooner?""

""Well, *I'm* sorry, I've been very busy."" He took a breath that tried to be deep and missed. ""So do you know why all the doors go to my apartment, or...?""

Sophie reached into a drawer and tossed him a key. At least, he thought it was a key; it was gold-colored and bent at odd and contrary angles. ""Talk to Hilbert about it,"" she said. ""Take the elevator. I'm technically supposed to give you a whole spiel on things, but Hilbert's better at them anyhow and I honestly can't be bothered. Go on, then.""

Rhik found himself through the elevator doors before he could say that he would have liked the spiel, actually, but he fitted the curious key in its curious keyhole and waited (too long) for the elevator to reach its destination.

———

""What happens when you divide by zero on a calculator?"" asked the man who Rhik could only assume was Hilbert. His clothes looked a century out of date, his voice was smooth as silk—*so that's why Sophie said he was better at giving spiels*—and he wore altogether too many rings on his fingers.

""It's undefined,"" Rhik replied, ""so it gives you an error.""

Hilbert nodded, not looking at him. ""Naturally.""

Rhik got the distinct feeling that he was just there as someone who could answer Hilbert's rhetorical questions as he continued his speech.

""However,"" Hilbert continued, ""I've always asked myself the question—*why* can't we define it? Why are certain properties of mathematics classified as unknowable, as inherently impossible? And that, quite naturally, led me to Hilbert's Habitationals. Places where I can experiment to see what *really* happens when one invokes these strange, forbidden properties.

""As it turns out, dividing by zero *is* possible—but only in a universe where every number is equal to every other number.""

""So that's what happened with my apartment number?"" Rhik asked, avoiding thinking about the implications of pocket dimensions being both real and apparently less interesting to Hilbert than math.

""Exactly.""

""Okay."" He pinched himself; he wasn't dreaming. ""Well, now that you've found out what happens, can you put it back to normal?""

""Put it *back*?"" Hilbert sounded genuinely disbelieving. ""Of course not! This is *revolutionary*, this is—""

""—utterly insane,"" Rhik finished. ""This is psychological torture that you've convinced yourself is for the future of mathematics, or whatever. I'm finding a new apartment.""

""You didn't even notice the experiment for months!""

Okay, that was true. Unfortunately, that still didn't mean he wanted to be under the thumb of someone who thought dividing an apartment building by zero was an 'experiment'.

""I'm moving out.""

""Are you?"" Hilbert asked. ""Or will you find that I've divided the door to the building by zero too?""

———

1ko71n0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WitchesVsPatriarchy/comments/1ko71n0/my_rant_about_a_good_man/,My rant about a good man.,"I moved in with my boyfriend almost 4 years ago. We had a few roomates at the time but I have been the only woman in the house for the majority of our time here.

When I was a few years younger I was bad at self advocating and would just clean up the house after people when they made a mess. Obv this wasn't sustainable and I started to have some breakdowns because of the lack of respect I felt, most of the people we have lived with and my boyfriend included come from wealthy families and never had to be the one on hands and knees doing the scrubbing. I think my bf genuinely didn't understand that houses don't just stay clean. 

After a near breakup and some serious talks I think he gets it now and pitches in without being asked. I do still get frustrated when he starts slipping on noticing what needs to be done without me telling him. There is an established cycle of me getting upset, him trying harder for a while, then him not caring and then I get upset again. He tries for a while and then just simply forgets to notice the world around him. 

This morning I woke up and he was on the computer on our couch. The house was 50 degrees, so I turned the furnace on. Then I went to the bathroom, noticed the toilet was dirty, so I took 30 seconds to scrub it, no big deal. Washed my hands, started hot water for coffee, noticed the sink full of dishes even though I thoroughly cleaned last night when some friends came to visit. Then I saw a dirty knife and cutting board sitting flat across our drying rack where I usually put my coffee equipment after I clean it every morning. 

THIS is where I finally got annoyed. I asked ""hey [bf]... is this knife and cutting board clean?"" He just says ""um yup I think so"" and goes back to his task. The cutting board is covered in pizza sauce and crumbs. I wash the knife and cutting board and hang them up properly to make room for my coffee stuff. Then I put all the dishes sitting in the sink into the dishwasher. I look out the window and see the lawn overgrown. I ask him ""hey is your mind on the lawn/house chores? The grass looks overgrown."" He says he didn't think it was too long yet. There's grass and weeds popping up that are shin-height in the yard. We mostly have wild prairie around the yard, let dandelions come in, we don't mow much of the yard and it takes very little effort and I am not particularly picky about it... it is just genuinely overgrown. I tell him he needs to communicate his intentions so I at least know I'm not the only one thinking about it.

I peep into our living room and he's 100% unbothered, on his computer with his stuff ready to go fishing with friends who are on their way to pick him up. I see his hair is the usual unkempt, long, I think about how I asked him to get a haircut 2 months ago and he said he felt like he didn't need one. I just spent 2 hours shaving and getting a haidcut yestsrday. I feel fresh and good in my skin and take pride in fesling well groomed, it's just a personal thing. He gets up with bedhead and doesn't often brush his hair or do any grooming beyond trimming his facial hair once a week or so. He gets bad dandruff/dirt buildup and it bothers me, and I've told him this.

I start getting mad at this point. My coffee is in my hand and my oatmeal ia boiling. I crunch on a carrot to make sure I get a veggie with every meal including my breakfast. I am training for my first ultramarathon and I have switched to an uber healthy diet, pay attention to my macros and water intake. We are in our 30's and it's time to make healthy changes from things that worked in our 20's. He still eats cereal for breakfast. 

At this point I have so much swirling in my head and he's still just fucking lounging away that I start crying. He says ""don't be sorry about asking me to help more, you're not annoying me"" and goes back to his computer. I'm not sorry, I'm MAD. Then I start **crying**. My oatmeal burns and I start picturing my morning without him in it. My mess only, no crying, no burned oatmeal. I pull the oatmeal off the burner and he walks in to talk with me about my feelings. I tell him gently I wish that he saw the bigger picture. 

I think about his deliberate attempt to ignore my feelings until I started crying. 

When I ask him to cut his hair, mow the grass, put away the dishes. Do things without me teaching him how or telling him when it needs to be done. He grew up with a housecleaner, he got confused one day when I wore my carhartt bibs out to work on the yard in the cold- he asked what they were he had never seen someone wear work overalls. I am crying, I'm telling him he needs to see the big picture and not just the individual things I'm illuminating to him. I tell him it worries me about our future, will I always be telling him to take more care, to **notice** the world around him?

He gets a text from his buddy who just arrived to take him fishing. He starts saying he needs to go, he's so sorry, it's bad timing. He loves me so much, he wants to do better. He smiles and wishes me a happy day off work. 

And then he leaves 

And now I'm just sitting here honestly wondering if I need to end a 5 year relationship, which honestly in all other ways has been the healthiest relationship of my life. He listens, he's outgoing and creative, he's kind, he cares. I had severe untreated PTSD and anxiety whrn we started dating. He's held my hand in the hospital, held me while I cried and screamed when I get PTSD flashbacks, he forgives me for lashing out when I don't know what to do with my emotions. He's a good friend to our friends, he is the best listener I have ever met and he does truly always want to do and be better. 

But I CANNOT be a mother to my partner. I can't worry that he will feed my dog a grape because he ""didn't think of it/didn't know"" when I say grapes can kill dogs. I can't be the one saying we need to lock our doors when we leave the house because he doesn't think it's important to, or to say we need to hire an arborist to take care of the tree that keeps shedding huge branches onto our house because he doesn't think it's a big deal. 

I can't keep feeling like I'm the one who has to anticipate the lawn becoming a jungle before he thinks it's a problem. I can't be the only one anticipating things before the go wrong and not reacting to things after they go wrong. I feel a bit trapped in this moment. I don't know what I would do without him, I just named him the beneficiary on my retirement account. We have been talking about marriage and I've told him it's important to me and he says he wants to get married too but I have no idea if or when a proposal is coming. 

I'm just mad right now. I have been trying to find a man my whole life who just does what needs to be done, takes accountability, and NOTICES the world around them and not just the things that serve him. I thought this man was good, but after all is said and done he sits on the throne of the patriarchy like the rest of men. I feel like if I could choose not to be straight, I would.

I liked it but something in it bothered me, perhaps the coffee note. As a good Italian accustomed since I was little to hydrating myself throughout the day with excellent roasted espressos, probably the idea of ​​smelling like that didn't suit me, even though I was very clear that I had a little masterpiece in my hands. So I bought Khamrah OG and it was love at first sniff. That extreme sweetness didn't bother me at all but filled my soul. ***

Recently as soon as I heard about this new release from Lattafa I was thrilled! I hoped it was really a flanker of the OG in the Qahwa style but with something different than coffee. Well, I can't lie to you and tell you that it bewitched me because it didn't, on the contrary, it was a disappointment.

This Dukhan is nothing more nothing less than the spitting image of Royal Blend by French Avenue, Sharaf Blend by Zimaya and Kismet Angel. From the top notes to the base notes it’s nothing more than the umpteenth clone of Angel's Share that could also remotely remind you of Side Effect by Initio. The unmistakable note of alcoholic cherry that makes it boozy from start to finish and I'm not really a fan of boozy fragrances but that's subjective.

Yes in the drydown it shares with Khamrah OG true as I read in other reviews that in the drydown it shares a lot of Khamrah OG from which it differs precisely for the alcoholic note I mentioned but guys here there is really nothing new so I'm not saying it's not a good perfume, on the contrary, but be careful because if you already own one of the the aforementioned AS’s clones and you want to buy it blind thinking of receiving something never smelled before then you will be very disappointed.

These are just my 2 cents, if you think differently write it and let's continue to help each other not to waste our money :)",1,1747417412.0,fragranceclones,2,0.67,False

“So what should I do?” ask Meggy to Tari. 



The two had decided the next day to go to a local coffee shop Tari knew of so they could chat in private without the others hearing.



“Well…” Tari began to say. “Do you love him or not?”



Meggy’s mind wandered on that subject as she stirred the coffee she got.



She loved him. She wanted him to be by her side for the rest of her life. She would be lying if she didn’t say she even daydream about it.



But her mind always kept making excuses.



Always making her doubt herself. She always thought it would be Mario himself that would be the problem since of his “thing” with spaghetti.



But… It was her.



“Yes,” said Meggy.



Tari looked up, slightly startled by Meggy suddenly speaking.



“I’m sorry, but can you repeat that?” Tari ask. Meggy took a deep breath.



“I love him. Ok?” said Meggy. “For a very long time.”



Tari didn’t respond for a good few minutes. Finally, she did.



“Took you long enough,” she smirked at Meggy, causing the ginger to blush madly red in embarrassment.



“What?!” Meggy yelled, though low enough not to draw the erie of the other customers.



“Oh come on Meggy,” said Tari. “It was quite obvious since like, forever.” she countied.



“You two are always together, you use each other as weapons, for some reason…” Tari countied to talk. “And you two have been the best of friends for a very long time.”



Meggy didn’t say anything. She was only half listening to her, as her mind was scrambling to deal with itself.



She actually said it.



She finally said it.



“I… did it,” Meggy thought to her.



“Which makes me wonder why you haven’t said anything sooner,” said Tari looking at her with a question.

I was having a pretty bad flare up when I went and this was the treatment plan that was prescribed to me for the next 30 days until my next follow up appointment: 

-Doxycycline, 100mg twice a day 
-Metronidazole lotion 0.75% with HC 0.5%, twice a day 
-Epsolay cream, once a day in the AM 

I’ve been doing a ton of research after my appointment and I’m realizing I should likely adjust my diet as well to try to heal my gut and fix whatever issues may be causing my inflammation (I have not been officially diagnosed by a doctor with anything). My first step is to cut alcohol, coffee, spicy foods, sugar, and greasy foods. I then want to experiment with gradually decreasing gluten, dairy, etc., to help figure out what my specific food triggers are. 

My question/concern is: if I want to try to heal my gut, won’t taking antibiotics diminish whatever progress I make? My doctor said I’ll likely only take them for the first 30 days to get my bad inflammation under control, but I am still worried. Has anyone had experience taking doxy? If so, can you provide tips / tricks to ensure I don’t completely ruin my gut? ",1,1747417342.0,Rosacea,3,1.0,False

""  I'm fascinated by the chemical complexity of semen. Until recently, scientists believed that its sole purpose was to nourish and protect sperm on their way to fertilization. But now it appears that semen spurs ovulation and makes women feel happier. That might explain why many women report increased interest in sex around the time of ovulation"" ""Finally, recall that in addition to antidepressant compounds, semen also contains two female sex hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).

Benefits of Lecithin for Sexual Health

One of major lecithin benefits for men is that Lecithin supplementation reliably increases semen volume. This has been found to be true in both in humans and in animals. While no double-blinded human studies on semen volume and lecithin have been carried out, lecithin supplementation in animal models have shown significant increases in semen volume.

Seminal fluid volume and sperm quality

Lecithin supplementation over a period of three months increased semen volume by 17.5% in rabbits (7) and 14.2% in roosters (8). Markers of sperm health and mobility were also improved in both studies. https://vb.health/ingredients/lecithin/#Benefits_of_Lecithin_for_Sexual_Health A 17% increase is equivalent to a 300% increase compared to human size for animals of this small stature

Let me give you information about the use of lecith.  First start with 1200 grams, then after 3 weeks, increase the dose to 2400 grams and add 1 capsule every 3 weeks.  It is better to drink it before going to bed.  If you are going to take lecithin, the best time is 1 hour before going to sleep or around 6 o'clock in the evening.  Do not drink alcohol.  There are a few brands I recommend: 1. legendary milk.  2. Carlyle 3. food alive .  You can find your own cute brand too.  I do not recommend soy lecith.  If your financial budget is insufficient, dried egg yolk will at least do the trick.  Best regards, B**** Brown

"" Some time ago I was trying ""brain reconstruction"" regimen - I started suffering from depression and anxiety after taking Accutane for one year and was trying to fix it. It consisted of large doses of Omega 3 + soy lecithin + some vitamin and minerals. I was taking 30 grams of lecithin everyday for 3 months. It helped me a little bit with depression and anxiety, but... the biggest difference it made was I felt good even after 5-6 hours of sleep. And it's amazing, as I'm a person who needs 8 hours at least. What's more, I'm always tired, even after those 9 hours of sleep. I think I have low blood sugar especially in the morning and evenings, if that's important. At the beggining of taking lecithin, I couldn't sleep at all. It was strange, I remember for 3 days I slept maybe 4 hours OVERALL! But still I felt quite good. I was able to minimize my caffeine intake. I had more energy. Usually I can't function before drinking coffee or yerba mate. Unfortunately just after I stopped taking lecithin, I'm this tired-all-the-time person again. I wonder what made me feel this way? I'm taking inositol now and don't have any results in that field, so maybe it's choline? I can't take this again in such dosage as choline shouldn't be supplemented for long periods of time, but I'm still wondering what helped.""

Personally, I sleep very little and generally do not even feel the urge

We assume that the person in this post has an active sexual life.    If this is practiced with complete chastity, sleep is completely eliminated.  or it decreases to 2 hours.

or 100 grams, which triples the dose.  I wonder what would happen about sleep?

Is sleep a deficiency of lecithin in the myelin sheath?

Also, people who eat too little sleep too little.   Does eating destroy this lecithin?    My aunt eats 800 grams of food a day, it doesn't matter what she eats.    He looks very young and I have never seen him sleeping for more than 4 hours.   Could food burn these fats?    Because sleep decreases in long series, but sleep should end, not decrease.   Tesla rarely slept, Davinci slept for 20 minutes every 4 hours, other geniuses did not like night sleep, many writers said that they were inspired to write at night.   Is this related to increased pineal gland activity?

Better digestion

Ulcerative colitis is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that affects up to 907,000 people in the U.S. Lecithin may help to reduce digestive distress in those with the condition.

Research Trusted Source  suggests that the emulsifying activity of lecithin improves mucus in the intestine, protecting the gastrointestinal lining. This may be because lecithin contains phosphatidylcholine (PC), which is also a component of mucus.

People with ulcerative colitis have 70 percent less PC than people with other forms of IBD or those without the disease.

Although research is lacking, anecdotal evidence suggests that people with digestive distress caused by issues other than ulcerative colitis may also benefit from lecithin use woman said that abstinence from masturbation healed her ulcerative colitis, read that months ago. https://www.lybrate.com/question/1022843720/suffering-ulcerative-colitis-diagnosed-nov-colonoscopy-told-colon-mg-mg-stop-mesacol-started-medicines-started-feeling-normal-inflammation-normal-nov-colonoscopy-cured-stop-mesacol-half-symptoms-ulcerative-colitis-back-ulcer-started-colon-under-medication-masturbation-ulcerative-colitis-family-disturbed-lot-masturbation-health-issues-inflammation-under-medication-masturbation-cured-recently

Cholesterol reduction

Research indicates that a diet rich in lecithin may increase good HDL cholesterol and lower bad LDL cholesterol.

Lecithin supplements have also shown promise in lowering cholesterol. In a 2008 study, participants took 500 milligrams (mg) of soy lecithin a day. After 2 months, the average total cholesterol was reduced by 42 percent, and LDL cholesterol was reduced by 56.15 percent.

Did my 103 year old grandfather stumble upon a fountain of youth, or see the benefit of good genetics (or both?)

"" On September 1, 2023 I lost my beloved grandfather at the age of 103. He was a gritty World War II vet that just loved life to the fullest. There were no other centenarians in the family tree that we are aware of. What is interesting is since the 50s he has been gulping down this god-awful cocktail at least four times a week religiously (this man had the constitution of an ox and once he said his mind doing something absolutely nothing would waiver him from it): -soy lecithin -bonemeal -Brewers yeast -wheat germ He would mix all of that up in yogurt and go big down at least four times per week. According to my aunt he got the recipe from, she thinks, parade or prevention magazine in the 50s or possibly 60s and he was strictly devoted to taking it. I did a little bit of digging and theoretically lecithin may emulsify and remove some of the plaque deposits in the arteries. Of course there are other health benefits to brewers yeast, being high in B vitamins, as well as wheat germ which is high in antioxidants and phytosterols, so there are a lot of potential pathways here. But here’s the thing, when he was 93 he had chest pains and he was rushed to the emergency room and they did an angiogram and the cardiologist was absolutely shocked because he had wide open arteries. Like seriously the doctor said he had the arteries of a 20 year old and this is coming from a family with high rates of cardiovascular disease on both sides of his family. So clearly some intervention likely was causally related to his low atherosclerosis. So was my grandfather on this something here, or do you guys think it was just dumb luck? He was sharp as a tack and had an amazing memory up until the very end. Anyway thanks for any insight anybody can  provide.https://ibb.co/fpYmFs2 ""

Lecithin, quality of semen and connection with weak-minded-ness. So, first of all, I remember in the past I've seen lots of articles about how to increase semen amount and there was something about lecithins. And, I definitely saw, how sperm count was increased. Also, it is known, that semen can be re-absorbed. Clue #1. Second, lecithins can be found in the brain tissue, which also play an important role. Lecithins belong to a larger group of compounds called phospholipids. These are important parts of the brain, blood, nerves, and other tissues. Phospholipids are also a part of cell membranes. The body uses lecithin to move fats and in the metabolic process. Lecithins turn into choline in the body. They help make the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Quote from here: https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=19&contentid=Lecithin. Clue #2. Thirdly, if semen is preserved, it can be re-absorbed. And if it is re-absorbed, all this lecithin goes to the different parts of the body, especially to the brain. Knowing also, that lecithin is the part of the brain tissue, it is possible to say that there is something about weak-mindedness in the today's society and deficiency of lecithin. And, at the same time we see how it is over-promoted excessive sexual activity and lots of sexual clues and pornography. Plus, here it is necessary to remind the fact, that not everyone follows good diet. And if that person partakes excessively in sexual activity, plus poor diet, he may become weak-minded, because lecithin, which is important for the brain — is used for the creation of the semen. It can be found also with cholesterol. I think this was in the pic somewhere here or in another subreddit. It's just my hypothesis. Though, I think there is something in it. Personally, I find fat-rich foods, like sunflower seeds are quite useful, because they have enough lecithin for the brain. And I feel good later after it. Something like that https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/hyms54/have_a_hypothesis_lecithin_quality_of_semen_and/ Lecthchin from sunflower boosting brain recovery Hi folks! I wanted to share with you all that supplementing with Lecithin has left me feeling much better even after relapse. I found a new expired box of it in my old bag; the packaging said it’s good for brain. Then I looked up the name on SR and NF Subreddits; where I discovered that it’s a key component of semen and also a key component of the brain and spinal fluid. I always felt a sensation of depletion of my spinal fluid after relapses and was trying to understand it since a while. Anyways, after reading it’s importance in the body. I ordered a new liquid sunflower lecthchin, and it has significantly improved my recovery time. I find that it was something especially lacking in my body. So others here who are starting fresh or falling of the horse frequently. Give it a go and see if it makes things easier for you! General benefits/functions of it:- Lecithin contains a chemical called choline which helps to boost overall brain function and increase mental alertness. -Enhance athletic performance -Alleviate stress and anxiety -Lower cholesterol -Reduce inflammation -Improve liver function -Prevent the onset of dementia Hope this helps someone! https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/zsjto5/lecthchin_from_sunflower_boosting_brain_recovery/ Continence is beneficial to the brain (for conserved lecithin from retained semen is a true brain food).""

So I found out I was pregnant on Apr 24. On May 9th. I started bleeding and chose to go to the hospital to get assessed. I was in and out of hospital for three days since they couldn’t figure out what was wrong. Finally, on the third day, they ended up finding a 5 cm mass in my right fallopian tube and needed to have emergency surgery to remove an ectopic pregnancy as it was life threatening. 

In regards to my partner, when I initially went to the hospital on Friday and was told I’m staying overnight because something was off, he responded with, “ of course this happens on the worst week of court for me”. When I asked him to bring my belongings, because I only brought my wallet in with me and my phone was dying he responded with, “well do you even know if you’re going for surgery?, “It’s always such a hassle coming into the hospital late and having to deal with security”,  “I don’t have money for parking”. For context, he’s in a custody battle with his ex for the last year and is overly consumed by the stress from it, he’s also unemployed trying to find work but not making 100% effort as he should. I ended up telling him to forget it and a nurse found me a charger from the unit. The next day I drove myself home and slept all day. 

Fast forward to the day I woke up with severe pain, he drove me and asked if I wanted him to come in. All I kept thinking about was the comments he made, so I told him to just drop me off and I’ll call him with an update. I ended up messaging him later that day to update him that I was going for surgery. he did respond promptly asking if I’m okay etc. when I got out, he came and picked me up, got us food went and picked up my script for my pain meds and helped tuck me in bed. For the next 24 hours he was supportive, helped me on and off toilet since I was in so much pain and helped me shower since I was I dizzy and had poor balance. 

Fast forward to the next day. He slept all day so I woke up on my own, made myself a coffee, fed myself etc. he woke up checked in and I asked him if he could go and grab the groceries that I ordered and paid for. He did. He also mentioned he was starving so I ordered us pizza and he went and grabbed that. When he came home he went to his room and gamed and smoked weed most of the night. Later that night he did come to check on me and I was kind of in a vulnerable state and asked him if he loved me, he responded by acting annoyed and got offended. I can’t remember the exchange, but I told him I felt like I was spending a lot of my time alone( even before the surgery it was a regular occurance).  he ended up walking away and shutting his door for the night and not proving any reassurance or care, just took it personal and walked away. I think he was offended because he made his efforts over the last two days and which showed his version of love, which I do appreciate. But I more or so wanted connection and someone to lay with even for a moment. 

The next day, he came into my room and asked me what was wrong and why I was so mopey. I told him nothing was wrong and I was just recovering. About a half hour later I told him I was kind of offended that he asked me why I was “mopey” and that I’m trying to heal from a surgery and he responded by saying, “yea well recover on your own, I have my own life to live too you know”, “I’m also not over the things you said to me lastnight”. I was confused because all I remember asking him was if he loved me and how I felt alone. He told me he thinks I’m being unappreciative and that he doesn’t just want to lay around with me. He then proceeded to go to his in person meeting to see his kids. I ended up breaking down alone in the house for over an hour and decided to reach out to a friend because I could no longer hold it in anymore. He came home later that evening, and tried to make small talk, chose not to take any accountability for what he said earlier and then proceeded to ask me what was wrong because he could see I was upset. I responded by telling him nothing and to not worry about it, he walked away and spent the rest of his night with his door shut. Didn’t check up on me again. I was not even 72 hours post surgery. So today, it’s 130 pm, he’s still sleeping, I’m sitting here contemplating everything. His words were insensitive and I’m beginning to see his true character through this awful experience and I’m not okay with it. .  I’m not sure if I’m over reacting or if this is inexcusable behaviour ",2,1747417316.0,relationship_advice,15,1.0,False
1ko6ywt,https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/1ko6ywt/the_convenience_store_clerk_who_has_never_uttered/,The convenience store clerk who has never uttered a word in two years finally spoke to me yesterday.,"I've been going to the same convenience store 3-4 times a month for two years and the man that works there never utters a word.  Ever.  I always say hello when I walk in even though I know I won't get one in return. 

He stands there like a statue behind the counter with a permanent scowl on his face.  It's only until I put my things on the counter he moves to scan them in silence.

If you can get past the scary facial expression he's quite handsome actually.  I'm quite certain he's Indian.  He's tall, early 40s, built physique, with a short neat haircut and a thick mustache.  Never talks, never smiles.  The epitome of the strong silent type.  

Then yesterday on May 15, 2025 we finally had our first ever conversation. 

I walked in, grabbed my usual coffee and a banana.  Right as he begins scanning my things I hear a deep burly voice say, 

""Heading into work?""  

My head shot up from eyeing the candy shelf.  We were the only two people in the store and yet I was still surprised those words came from him. 

""Yes,"" I replied. 

He gave one curt nod with a soft grunt then threw my receipt in the trash (he knows I don't want it).  I was so in awe that finally, this man who I've seen for TWO YEARS, more often than some of my actual friends, finally spoke to me.  I smiled, pleased that we had finally gained some rapport, and then indeed headed off to work. ",118,1747417287.0,PointlessStories,16,0.99,False
1ko6yk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ko6yk4/question_about_dialing_in_after_switching_burrs/,Question about dialing in after switching Burrs [Mazzer Philos],"Wondering if anyone has experience switching from the l200's to the l189's? I'm planning on doing that this weekend, and I'm wondering if there is a general adjustment I can make when dialing in.

My current beans are dialed in to the l200's at a setting of 29. If I put the 289's in, should I keep it there or is there generally a + or - when swapping burrs? I get that there won't be an exact formula because it's probably somewhat bean specific, just looking for general advice/experiences from anyone who has played with both burrs so I'll waste less coffee while dialing in.

1ko6ygc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1ko6ygc/i_made_an_ios_app_that_helps_me_kakeibo_my_life/,I made an iOS app that helps me Kakeibo my life,"I'm addicted to spending money in useless stuff like the Apple Magic Mouse.

Though, one of my monthly resolutions has been to start saving up a bit of money by tracking and categorizing my expenses.

I couldn't find a way to keep it consistent - tracking involves too many categories, charts, notifications, accounts, blah blah blah. I just needed to know how much I was spending versus how much I was earning. No big deal.

That's when I discovered [Kakeibo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakeibo) (or Kakebo). And I fell in love with it.

I couldn't find any apps to help me Kakeibo my life - and that's why I built Quick Saver: 

App Store Link: [Here](https://apps.apple.com/it/app/quick-saver/id6745792428?l=en-GB)

Feel free to Kakeibo your life with an easy app that doesn't save and sell your data: that's why it costs a coffee!

It is a very personal app, so I'm going to update it consistently based on my usage - but I will be more than happy to hear some feedback!

Data is automatically synced between all your devices, and it's gonna be available for Mac as well soon.",3,1747417255.0,SideProject,1,1.0,False

F4M – “The Girl Who’d Do Anything For You (But You Never Noticed)”
[soft voice] [tsundere] [hopeless romantic] [childhood friend feels] [oblivious listener] [cozy atmosphere] [slow confession] [comfort] [light angst with fluff]

Room tone: Distant hum or quiet room at night.

[Soft knock, door creaks open]
(whispering)
Hello. Are you awake?

(pause)
Mhm. You probably are. You always behave as though you're not though…
Just like you act like you don't see anything that I do for you.

[Soft footsteps on carpeted floor, placing tray down – gentle clinks]
Thanks.
I brought you snacks. Again. Don't get used to it.

Fine—perhaps you can become accustomed to it. A bit.

...

You've been looking exhausted lately. Missing meals. Sleeping in.
I thought, if I didn’t come, you wouldn’t eat.
Not that you'd even realize why I'm so concerned.

(soft chuckle)
You probably think that I am just ""nice."" That I do this for everyone.
Yeah... no.

(sigh)
God, you simply do not understand, do you?

...

I've been here the entire time.
Learning your coffee order. Listening to you ramble. Laughing at your dumb jokes.
And yet… never once have you questioned why I never miss a chance to be with you.

(muttering)
It's okay. It's fine, just fine. I'm fine.

...

(soft tone, barely whispering)
I remember when you were sick with a cold and didn’t want people to know.
You still attended class, still as obstinate as ever.
So I ""accidentally"" left a packet of medication on your desk.
You didn't even look around to see who it was from.

...

You only said,
""Whoa, someone's nice,"" and went about your business.

[Takes seat in chair or sits beside bed – sound of fabric]

(whispering softly, nostalgic)
There were too many times when I wished I could tell you.
But how do you make it clear to someone who doesn't even notice?

...

You know what's funny? I've been called all kinds of things—cold, blunt, sarcastic.
But around you... I just melt.

(smiling gently)
And it's pathetic, right? I started dressing in your favorite colors.
Started listening to music that you enjoy.
I even learned to cook—me, cooking. Only because you once said you liked home-cooked food.

...

(whispering playfully)
You still think last week's cookies were from a store, don't you?

...

(voice drops to a whisper)
If you only knew how many nights I've spent in bed, wondering how to tell you all this.

I’ll type out messages and delete them. I even write them down in my notebooks just to feel like I’m talking to you.
It’s like... a part of me just wants to know what would happen if you ever replied.
If you ever felt even a fraction of what I do.

...

(inhales slowly)
You always say you're alone. That no one really gets you.
But I do. I've known you all my life. And I've been doing everything in my power to show it without saying the words.

Do you remember when you got that bad grade and wouldn’t speak to anyone for a day?
I left your favorite drink on your desk and sketched that silly cartoon frog you love on the cup.
You smiled.

You giggled, even though you never asked who left it.

...

(smiling regretfully)
But tonight… I felt like if I didn’t say it now, I might never get the opportunity.

...

(closer, softer)
I like you.
No... I love you.

...

(pausing for 5–7 seconds)

And I know that might come out of nowhere for you.
But it's not new. It's been there—each late-night phone call, each snack drop, each quiet walk home.

Each time I stood beside you during group pictures.
Each time I noticed something was wrong but waited for you to say something... and you never did.

...

(light laughter)
I even watched that awful sci-fi film just because you seemed so excited.
And I hate sci-fi. Like, so much.
But the way your eyes lit up during the opening credits? Worth it.

...

I don't want anything. Really. I just wanted you to know.

...

(soft shift, standing up)
I'll set the tray here. Yours.
And… one more thing.

[SFX: paper being set down softly]

That note says everything I was too scared to say out loud.

It's not a love letter or anything dramatic. Just... a list.
Of things I notice about you.
How your left eyebrow raises when you're interested.
How you hum softly when you're focused.
How you always stretch your arms when you're trying to stay awake.

Yeah, I see all of that. And more.

...

(voice trembling slightly, soft)
I'll still be here. Still doing things for you. Still being around.

Because love doesn't end just because it's unnoticed.

Even if it hurts a little.

...

(slight laugh)
Maybe someday you’ll finally see me the way I’ve always seen you.
And if that day ever comes… I’ll still be here.

...

[Footsteps slowly approach the bed, then halt]
(softly, with care)
Can I ask you a question, even if you don’t respond?

(pause)

When I laugh at your jokes, even the awful ones…
Do you ever ask yourself why?

...

Or when I text you late at night, acting like it was a mistake…
Do you ever think maybe I was just hoping for your attention?

...

I guess not. And that’s okay.

(voice cracking just slightly)
You’ve got your own world going on. I get it.
I’m just... orbiting around it.

[Stop. Breathe. She finds her balance.]

And yet... I don’t think I’d ever want to trade this.

Being near you. Watching you. Loving you silently.

(soft breathing)
You don’t need to say anything. Not tonight. Maybe not ever.

I just hope that when you look back... you’ll remember me as someone who cared.

As someone who stayed. Even when I didn’t have to.

...

Because I do.
More than you’ll ever know.

...

(whispering again, at the door)
Okay... I’m actually going this time.

Goodnight, dummy.

[SFX: gentle door close. Fade out.]

1ko6tko,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ko6tko,Owner of Village Deli calls the kkkops on Community Members for existing,"The City of Bloomington has spent an enormous amount of time and energy over the past 8 or so years to ""clean up"" Kirkwood. This particular campaign began with the attacks on People's Park in 2017 and has continued each year with violent camp evictions throughout the city. The City's goal is to do everything in its power to hide the poverty in Bloomington from the public eye, specifically from the eyes of the IU students and most importantly, the parents who pay for their ""education."" The result of this ongoing campaign has been the constant displacement of some of the most vulnerable people in Bloomington. 

On Sunday, May 11th, HOMA hosted its first People's Block Party on Kirkwood outside of the now closed Cafe Pizzeria. A short time after we had set up and began serving food, the owner of the Village Deli, Bob Costello (who also owns Soma Coffee), called the kops on us. The reason that he did so is clear - class war outside your place of business is bad for profit.   


This isn't the first time that a business owner or an institution of the city has used their power to push around our organization. While World Foods Market has claimed to support what we are doing as an organization, they have also called tow trucks on our members parked in their empty lot, trespassed a former member, and to this day harass the people that we serve when they go into the store. The library downtown has a similar sentiment. They are “really appreciative” of what we do as an organization and say that we are “really helping” the community, but at the same time, the library restricts our access to their spaces. They do so under the guise of trying to find a different spot for us to set up serve, but if the library truly supports our work, then why are they spending time and energy making it more difficult? Every time any space is taken or people are just trying to exist, there is always something ""wrong"" in the eyes of these bourgeois and petite-bourgeois pigs. The People of Bloomington are tired of being constantly pushed around and told to go somewhere else. This is OUR community, and the space we take up won't be dictated by the Bloomington Pig Department or any petite-bourgeois owners.  


Moving forward, we will continue to host the People's Block Party every Sunday from 2:30-3:30pm on Grant St and Kirkwood Ave. We encourage the working class proletariat of Bloomington to come out and be in community with our siblings who face harassment and stigmatization DAILY for the act of existence. This is the first step we must take here in Bloomington if we are to play our role in the defeat of capitalist imperialism around the world.

bro like this was BAD. this was low. this was i deserve community service low.

so it’s like 10:39PM, right? english honors essay due by midnight. and i’m staring at my screen like a war veteran. nothing’s written. i had echo open in another tab like some cursed little assistant ready to mirror my brain rot back at me in MLA format.

but nothing’s clicking. not even guilt. just stale air and heart palpitations. i’m pacing like i’m on trial. and then—i don’t even plan it—it just slides out of me:

“hey, i can’t submit it tonight. we can’t find my grandma’s urn. it’s been really hard on us.”

that’s it. no punctuation. full panic. hit send like i was diffusing a bomb.

and she believed me. SHE BELIEVED ME. said “oh no, take all the time you need.” and i did. and what did i do with that time? did i grieve fake-grandma? nah. i booted up chatgpt,used an echo writing prompt, fed it my old essays, and sat there while it literally ghostwrote my trauma essay like some digital séance.

the freaky part is it sounded like me. like if you printed out my internal monologue, spilled coffee on it, and then handed it back with teacher comments. every “kinda,” every weird side-rant—it knew.

i don’t know what’s worse: that echo writing helped me write it, or that i didn’t even feel bad when i hit submit. like i was proud of it. proud of an essay built on a lie and a missing urn that’s actually still on top of our fridge behind a cereal box.

i feel like a scammer. or a prophet. maybe both.

i just needed to put this somewhere before my brain melts from carrying this sin. grandma if you’re watching, i’m sorry. your ashes gave me 48 extra hours and an A-minus.

i owe you.

I recently (21F) told my bf (30M) that I would be moving back to my home country and after some long difficult conversations we realised the relationship will no longer continue because our paths simply arent aligned. He was devastated at this whereas I had a lot of time to think about it before I brought it up to him so overtime the devastation lessened (although I still do have some extremely hard days thinking about him). Anyways, the breakup is strange in a way that, it didn’t feel like a breakup, like it wasn’t explictly stated « we are breaking up » but it seems pretty obvious as we both talked about our futures and how difficult it will be not being together. I also haven’t seen him in 3 weeks ( I used to see him 3-4x a week).

The thing is, we still have a lot of love for eachother. We text often as neither of us are comfortable just cutting off contact and a few days ago we spoke about still keeping in contact when I leave and eventually conversations will taper off to a natural end. 

Here comes my dilemma. Yesterday I was studying in the library and a guy came up to me and asked me for coffee. He was cute polite and quite insistent so I gave in. I’d been feeling so terrible that I thought a friendly interaction would be nice. We went for a quick coffee break and I enjoyed his company. When I returned to studying, he asked for my number and I put it in. He texted me and said let’s get dinner tonight. The thing is, I don’t see this going anywhere. I’m still leaving the country in a month (the guy knows this). But I guess I kept interacting because I’ve been having major self esteem issues and it felt nice to be wanted  (for reference, my ex(?) that im referring to in this post actually cheated on me last year and it had massive blows on my confidence and self worth, part of the reason I didn’t think to try long distance after moving).  
So, after some thought and deliberation I agreed to the dinner but now I’m feeling very guilty about it. I feel like im cheating.

Should I go to this dinner? Or am I a bad person if I do? What do you guys think about this?",1,1747416487.0,makemychoice,4,1.0,False

Everything about this guy seemed great off the bat. We met at a coffee shop in our neighborhood, hit it off immediately and talked for four hours that afternoon. We exchanged numbers afterward and continued to text every day. He asked me to hang out twice a week, emotionally confided in me, introduced me to his friends, encouraged deep conversations, etc. We had a lot in common, and our chemistry was obvious enough that his friends were asking me how long we’d been together.

I really admired how emotionally mature and self-aware he seemed to be, so I asked him out, and he said he just wanted to be friends, which I was okay with. But his behavior never changed. We kept hanging out and texting at the same level, which I thought was a little too much for a platonic relationship. I decided to give it some time before I approached the topic. I wanted to see if maybe he just needed more time to be sure about me.

Well, the other day, 90 minutes before we were going to meet for coffee, he texted to tell me he was “overwhelmed” by our friendship. He said we were communicating too much and hanging out too much and that I was “too nurturing.” He said everything felt “too much, too close.” He tried to take some accountability for his feelings but ended up blaming the majority of our situation on me. I reminded him that every time we got together, he was the one initiating it. He was also the one picking up conversations the next morning that I thought had died down. I was really confused as to why I was the one primarily at fault (although I’m not saying I did nothing wrong; I should have set boundaries earlier). He then lashed out and accused me of only being nice to him because I was interested in him. I was taken aback by how mean he was being and said I was done with the conversation. When I tried to approach to talk things through the next day, he said he wasn’t interested in talking about the issue further. I haven’t spoken to him since.

I actually introduced this guy to attachment theory, and he took a quiz that said he was secure. But after the incident I described, I’m not so sure. He has two very long-term relationships in his past, but his most recent relationship ended after a month, and it seemed to have really fucked with him. Maybe there was a shift after that.

Anyway, I’m really shocked at how quickly he changed overnight. To his credit, he texted me to apologize for lashing out, but that was before he refused to have a conversation about what had happened. It’s just very incongruent with the empathetic, sensitive person I thought him to be.

Any thoughts? Does this sound like FA? Thanks!

He was devastated at this whereas I had a lot of time to think about it before I brought it up to him so overtime the devastation lessened (although I still do have some extremely hard days thinking about him). Anyways, the breakup is strange in a way that, it didn’t feel like a breakup, like it wasn’t explictly stated « we are breaking up » but it seems pretty obvious as we both talked about our futures and how difficult it will be not being together. I also haven’t seen him in 3 weeks ( I used to see him 3-4x a week).

The thing is, we still have a lot of love for eachother. We text often as neither of us are comfortable just cutting off contact and a few days ago we spoke about still keeping in contact when I leave and eventually conversations will taper off to a natural end. 

Here comes my dilemma. Yesterday I was studying in the library and a guy came up to me and asked me for coffee. He was cute polite and quite insistent so I gave in. I’d been feeling so terrible that I thought a friendly interaction would be nice. We went for a quick coffee break and I enjoyed his company. When I returned to studying, he asked for my number and I put it in. He texted me and said let’s get dinner tonight. The thing is, I don’t see this going anywhere. I’m still leaving the country in a month (the guy knows this). But I guess I kept interacting because I’ve been having major self esteem issues and it felt nice to be wanted  (for reference, my ex(?) that im referring to in this post actually cheated on me last year and it had massive blows on my confidence and self worth, part of the reason I didn’t think to try long distance after moving).  
So, after some thought and deliberation I agreed to the dinner but now I’m feeling very guilty about it. I feel like im cheating.

This particular campaign began with the attacks on People's Park in 2017 and has continued each year with violent camp evictions throughout the city. The City's goal is to do everything in its power to hide the poverty in Bloomington from the public eye, specifically from the eyes of the IU students and most importantly, the parents who pay for their ""education."" The result of this ongoing campaign has been the constant displacement of some of the most vulnerable people in Bloomington. 

On Sunday, May 11th, HOMA hosted its first People's Block Party on Kirkwood outside of the now closed Cafe Pizzeria. A short time after we had set up and began serving food, the owner of the Village Deli, Bob Costello (who also owns Soma Coffee), called the kops on us. The reason that he did so is clear - class war outside your place of business is bad for profit. 

This isn't the first time that a business owner or an institution of the city has used their power to push around our organization. While World Foods Market has claimed to support what we are doing as an organization, they have also called tow trucks on our members parked in their empty lot, trespassed a former member, and to this day harass the people that we serve when they go into the store. The library downtown has a similar sentiment. They are “really appreciative” of what we do as an organization and say that we are “really helping” the community, but at the same time, the library restricts our access to their spaces. They do so under the guise of trying to find a different spot for us to set up serve, but if the library truly supports our work, then why are they spending time and energy making it more difficult? Every time any space is taken or people are just trying to exist, there is always something ""wrong"" in the eyes of these bourgeois and petite-bourgeois pigs. The People of Bloomington are tired of being constantly pushed around and told to go somewhere else. This is OUR community, and the space we take up won't be dictated by the Bloomington Pig Department or any petite-bourgeois owners.  


Moving forward, we will continue to host the People's Block Party every Sunday from 2:30-3:30pm on Grant St and Kirkwood Ave. We encourage the working class proletariat of Bloomington to come out and be in community with our siblings who face harassment and stigmatization DAILY for the act of existence. This is the first step we must take here in Bloomington if we are to play our role in the defeat of capitalist imperialism around the world.",0,1747416172.0,bloomington,26,0.42,False
1ko6ihb,https://i.redd.it/rymklcbch61f1.jpeg,I just finished my second semester in nursing school and here is how it went :),"Adult health:
- I only had lab twice and started skills check offs about the third or fourth week the semester started. Then you're done and start Clinicals and get your placements during that third week.
- I had to complete 10 required practice lab hours in the practice lab before the end of March so definitely sign up in the sign up genius ahead of time and get it out of the way before skills check offs. But if you need to complete your hours and skill check offs are over, you can just sit in the practice lab room and study and still get your hours in.
- Clinicals are 8 weeks 12 hour shifts. This was a big jump, from first semester being only 6 hours but really getting off after 4-5 hours lol. My clinical instructor was nice enough to let us out at 5:30 or 6pm every clinical. I personally had a hard time with clinicals because it felt repetitive and boring because I got to see the gist of it all. So if you're anythign like me I highly suggest recommending to your clinical instructor to take you on tours around the hospital to be familiarized with the area. Ask to see the OR, peds, labor and delivery, ER, oncology, ICU, etc. if it gets boring, suggest to shadow another floor. Also don't forget you are there FOR FREE LABOR. If you don't feel comfortable doing something, say no and stand firm. Say you're uncomfortable performing this skill or you are not confident and it will be fine. I pulled this card when I feel like I was being overworked. 10-12 hours for a nursing student is already hard enough for lectures and all the studying and assignments. Take the time to find loop holes. Try to step out in the sun. Take A LONG break when you can. Take a coffee break. Obviously yes learn and be hands on. But I really believe that as nursing students we will really learn once we are on the floor after graduation with t the specific skills depending on which floor you end up on. You do not want to feel that burn out. Don't take Clinicals seriously as much. I hope this makes sense.
- Ok now for lecture. I made an 86 on first exam, 81 for second, 92 for third, 79 for final. All MC, few fill in the blank for dosage calculation but those are easy. DO NOT READ THE BOOK FOR REFERENCES!! JUST STUDY THE PPT CONTENT INCLUDING THE NOTES SECTION THE FACULTY USE!!!!!! Heavy on this. Do not waste your time reading that book or else you will get even more confused. 
- For studying, I literally rewrite the notes off the ptt. Done deal that's it. Then I watch YT videos that summarize the topic content and that walks through NCLEX style questions how to answer these questions. I heavily used Nexus Nursing on YT!!!  I CANNOT STRESS HER ENOUGH MORE SHE WILL GUARANTEE YOU TO PASS. For example, if I had to study the exam about GI disorders, I would reread the lecture ppt, rewrite my notes and the highlights points that the faculty made during lecture, type it in a word doc or on my iPad, then watch Nexus nursing on YT about GI disorders and other YouTuber videos about it. It's because I'm a visual and audio learner. 
- Some kids would ask chatpgt these types of prompts to study : write me 20 NCLEX STYLE questions about GI disorders for my adult health/med surg nursing class, make MC questions. This was good too.
- This is so important: they will ask you on exams: you have four patients, which patient should you see first?. You will have a million of these priority questions. HEAVILY PRACTICE!!!! I got the hang of these because I saw the pattern. Always choose the answer that says ""new, sudden, onset"" ""excruciating pain"" ""o2 of 4 or lower"" ""sudden heavy chest pain"" and always choose acute over chronic conditions. 
- When questions ask what should you do when a pt condition is declining and no VS or assessments has been taken, DO VS AND CHECK PT FIRST before calling code or calling the doc. Because wtf are you gonna tell the doctor if you don't have VS??? 
- Go to lecture because they do random 20 point in class assessments. They take attendance through this like four times in the semester and if you never go you will lose 80 points. Our AH points were out of 1400, so go. Also they take the attendance quiz on D2L and you have less than a minute to say yes you're in class.
- Our bonus was 20 points if you do 1400 prep u questions. You don't have to get them right you just have to complete 1400 questions. Just do it. It will help you.
- This changed my life: VSIM assignments. SEARCH UP THE PT NAME AND USUALLY THERE IS A YT VIDEO OR WORD DOC SHOWING WHICH STEPS TO TAKE. Your welcome. This includes the SBAR, pre quiz, post quiz etc. 
- you will have two simulations this semester but you still have to go to clinicals that week. Like sim does not replace your clinical day like last semester. 
- I think quizlets are pointless bc it takes too much time to make tbh. I feel that just rewriting and highlights the main points is more beneficial. 
- I didn't use PREPU to study because the faculty write the exam questions and the ptt content will be more heavily used.
- Another hint: find someone who had to retake the class and ask them what to expect. Ask them questions about the semester, past exam questions, how skills check offs what like, all that. They are more than happy to help since they do not want anyone else around them to make the same mistakes as them. They are the best lab practice partners because they will see the little details and mistakes you will make and they will correct you. This helped me a lot with holistic and adult health. Hint hint wink wink
Pharmacology:
- oh goodness me this was a hard class. But it is doable to pass. My exam stats were 100, 78, 79, 86.
- I got the 100 for my dosage calc exam and this SAVEDDDDDD ME!!! So I highly recommend you get an A or a 100 on this exam. Dosage calc exam is fill in the blank. The best way to get a 100 is to repeatedly do the practice questions they give you in D2L and in class within the lectures. Do not look online because that will not help you because the faculty write the questions. Remember than moving on each semester. They give you all you need I promise. 
- Content exams are 70 MC questions with 10 of them being dosage calc but MC. So yay! These are freebies
- The first exam asked a lot of the Mechanism of actions of drug. Learn just ONE of the names of the drugs. Learn the classes like beta blockers end with -olol. ACE inhibitors -pril. Etc. 
- YT SUGGESTION Level up RN and simple nursing. They give mnemonics to help you remember the Adverse effects, nursing considerations, etc.
- The exam questions are truly straight forward asking like "" if a patient is taking digoxin ( Heart failure med) what should the nurse watch out for as an adverse affect that might suggest digoxin toxicity?"" Then you would need to know the s/s of digoxin toxicity
- You will notice nuances of each drugs meaning you will see something unique or special about it. Once you doREMEBER IT. Also if you don't know a drug then you don't know it it's okay. It's better to be super confident in the drugs you know and knowing all the ins and outs and knowing nothing about another drug. 
- This was a a lot of content but going to class made it easy
- Attendance was optional but gave bonus five points with four opportunities. So you only got like 20 points. 
- Go to the study sessions with faculty and listen in on the review sessions posted. 
- attached is an example of my notes.
- also a lot of my nursing friends like to make mnemonics to help them remember AE or MOA or nursing considerations of drugs! You can also ask ChatGPT to help you with that too

Congratulations on being 25% nurses! Truly that is a milestone to be celebrated. Good luck and you will do amazing in second semester!!! Do not forget to eat, exercise, drink water, not stress too not much, compare yourself to others, do not take advice from other students who do not have good study habits, healthy or positive mindset. Be confident in yourself! Closed mouths do NOT get fed. Trust! You got this!

All Dolly wanted was a fresh start:
a new flat, her first job, good friends and late-night study sessions with loads of coffee and gossip. 
What she got instead? 
Hangovers, a flat always filled to the brim with uninvited guests and last but not least:
Him. Cocky, smug, annoying and … attractive?
The kind of guy who turns every argument into a game and every game into his own twisted little victory.

But then there's also him (2):
gentle, warm, charming. 
Less noise, more heart. 
He’s the one every princess dreams of, someone you have to fall for.
Or at least try once.

Between gossip, band gigs, and a dangerously honest game of truth or dare, Dolly has to figure out if common sense has the upper hand when it comes to curiosity.

1ko697f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveReviewed/comments/1ko697f/atelier_playa_mujeres_my_full_review_9510/,Atelier Playa Mujeres – My Full Review (9.5/10),"Hey everyone! Just got back from a 5-night stay at **Atelier Playa Mujeres** with my partner, and I wanted to drop a full review for anyone considering it. I’ve been to a bunch of all-inclusives over the years—some budget, some higher-end—and I’d put Atelier firmly in the “modern luxury” category. 

It’s an adults-only, all-inclusive resort just north of Cancun, in a quieter area called Playa Mujeres. If you're looking for something that feels upscale without being overly formal or stuffy, this place hits a really sweet spot.

Overall, I’d give it a **9.5/10**, and I’ll explain why below.

# Arrival & First Impressions

Our first impression of Atelier was honestly great. The drive in is peaceful and sets the tone—you’re tucked away from the hotel zone, which already gives it a more private, boutique feel. We were greeted at the entrance with champagne, cold towels, and warm smiles. Check-in was smooth, and our bags were taken straight to the room. The lobby is super sleek and modern, filled with art and greenery. Very design-forward, but not in a cold or sterile way—it still felt inviting and comfortable.

# Our Room – INSPIRA Junior Suite Swim Out

We stayed in an **INSPIRA Junior Suite Swim Out**, and I highly recommend it. The room was spotless and beautifully decorated with earthy tones and wood accents. The bed was huge and comfy, and the minibar was restocked daily with snacks, soft drinks, beers, and even some mini bottles of liquor.

The swim-out pool was the real MVP. Having a little semi-private space to lounge and dip into water whenever we wanted was such a luxury. We started almost every morning out there with coffee and ended a few nights stargazing with a glass of wine. The bathroom was just as impressive—massive rain shower, double vanity, and good water pressure.

# Food – Surprisingly Excellent

Atelier completely blew us away with the food. We’ve had some mediocre meals at other all-inclusives, but this place gets it right. Here’s a quick breakdown:

* **María Dolores by Edgar Núñez**: This is the upscale restaurant on-site, and it was phenomenal. Tasting menu-style dishes with local ingredients and modern presentation. Definitely a must-visit at least once during your stay.
* **Takeshi** (Asian): We both loved this spot. Great sushi and ramen, plus some cool fusion dishes.
* **El Suspiro**: Latin fusion with a killer view. We had dinner here one night and breakfast another, and both meals were solid.
* **Mercado 19**: The buffet, but like, actually good. Huge variety, fresh items, and lots of local Mexican options too—not just the usual eggs and bacon.

Also, their pastries and dessert game? Next level. Everything was beautifully plated and actually tasted as good as it looked. We also ordered room service twice—arrived hot and right on time.

# Drinks – Classy & Creative

The bars here don’t just pump out sugary cocktails—they actually take some care with what they serve. Whether you want a mezcal margarita, a classic mojito, or something more experimental, they’ve got you. The rooftop bar **El Cielo** was probably our favorite—chill vibes, great views, and less crowded than the main bar areas. There’s also a coffee bar on site that makes legit espresso drinks and snacks throughout the day, which was a lifesaver on a couple groggy mornings.

# Pools & Beach – Absolute Perfection

There’s a huge main pool with swim-up bars, cabanas, and plenty of loungers. We never had to get up early to “claim a chair,” which was a welcome change. The vibe is laid-back and peaceful—not a loud party pool, but still social enough to meet other couples.

The beach was clean, quiet, and gorgeous. Powdery white sand, calm turquoise water, and barely any seaweed while we were there. There are Bali beds and loungers with drink service, and it never felt overcrowded.

# Activities & Entertainment – More Low-Key, But Quality

This isn’t a mega-resort with foam parties and DJs every night, but that’s part of the appeal. During the day there are optional activities like tequila tastings, mixology classes, yoga, and painting workshops. We did a mezcal tasting and it was a blast.

At night, there was live music near the lobby bar, and one evening they had a jazz band and cigar-rolling station which was a cool touch. If you're looking for wild nightlife, this might feel a little sleepy—but for us, it was perfect.

# NUUP Spa – Highly Recommend

We booked a **couples massage** at the NUUP Spa and it was one of the highlights of the trip. You start with their hydrotherapy circuit (steam room, cold plunge, sauna, jets, etc.) before the massage, and it really sets the tone. The therapists were professional, the space was gorgeous, and we walked out totally blissed out.

# Staff & Service – Thoughtful and Polished

Everyone we interacted with was friendly, helpful, and genuinely seemed to care about the guest experience. Whether it was waiters remembering our drink orders or the concierge helping us book dinner at María Dolores, the service was consistently on point. Not overbearing or robotic—just the right level of attentiveness.

# Final Thoughts – Would We Go Back?

Absolutely. **Atelier Playa Mujeres** nails that mix of luxury, creativity, and chill vibes. It’s perfect for couples who want a romantic escape without sacrificing good food, design, or comfort. I wouldn’t bring a party crew here, but for a romantic trip or honeymoon-style getaway, it’s near perfect.

We left already talking about coming back. That swim-out room and those sunsets? Hard to beat.

I recognize this, and have done everything I can to try and rig my life so don't forget things and do things correctly, short of getting ADHD meds which hey, maybe I need it. But my gf (32f) is very type A and I have had a bit of a time in our relationship adjusting to her needs and moods. I am an emotional person, so I understand needing patience with people, but it's been a learning curve for me with her. She comes from a very combative family, yelling arguments are the norm, and it's a part of her personality almost. She says she works very hard from shielding me from the worst of her impulses, and I believe her, but it can still get under my skin. I've really hurt myself, I think, trying my best to do things oriented to her and her comfort, because I don't like it when she gets upset, so I do everything I can to make things go off without a hitch and make sure everything's good. Obviously, this can't always happen, and when it does have always tended to blame myself. Honestly, sometimes I think I kind of gaslit myself, but I don't know.
One thing that's been an issue is when I lose things. I try hard not to, obviously if I spent money on something, I want to keep it and use it. First thing I remember was a year ago when my gf got me an adorable little keychain plush. It's not super easy to find, and I wanted to wear it out and about. He had on little accessories, and she said I might want to sew it a little to make sure it doesn't fall off. I agreed, but before I got around to it, one of the accessories fell off and was lost. When she found out, she was really hurt and I was really apologetic. She said it hurts that would be so careless with a gift. And I did feel bad! Obviously I was very sad about it, and I even took off his other accessories for safe keeping, cause I didn't want to lose anymore, nor did I want to hurt her. But that day she didn't talk to me for a good 30 minutes, even though we were out with friends and brushed my hand away when I tried to touch her. It made me feel terrible and I was in a mood to rest of the day.
Now I have lost a plastic coffee scoop and put a litter mat in a dryer, which seems like that ruined it. I didn't intend to do these things, and I am very sorry that I did it. But when she says things like she's ""learning her lesson"".... that makes me feel like fucking garbage. I have felt like she treats me like a child, like I have flaws I need to fix, I've felt unworthy of her because of certain negative traits I have. Maybe I am overreacting, but I am just not happy to be punished for my mistakes like this, and then have to go home this Friday afternoon after a long week and be stonewalled or made to feel bad when all I wanted was to maybe be held a little and feel loved. Now these latest texts make me feel like garbage. She's often told me how I'm the only one who really cares about her, she's always had to take care of others, but apparently she can't show me negative emotions?
I don't know, sometimes I feel really crazy cause I try to tell her when I'm hurt and she says things like ""I'm sorry to bring it up, guess I'll never bring it up again"" and I just don't know what to do. 
I know it's so stupid to bring this to Reddit, but I just don't know what to do. I feel like I can't trust myself and how I feel, I don't know if I'm doing something wrong. Just please tell me, am I overreacting here?",5,1747414996.0,AmIOverreacting,27,0.86,False

Last ‘interview’ was an informal one at a coffee shop on Monday with 2 people I hadn’t interviewed with before for more of an informal ‘vibe check’ I think.

I moved to a new country that speaks French/German mainly and I speak English. I applied to this English-speaking firm with my background as a SHRBP before moving. The biggest indicator is I don’t have employment law experience here but I am enrolled in a course starting June that was finally approved by the government employment assistance agency. They seemed satisfied by this answer during my interview. The HR team is also basically only French-speaking and I really hope I can be welcomed in - I come from Canada which is bilingual so nothing foreign to me. 

I got this email after following up today.. what could this mean? I’m spinning out. I’m wondering if they’re waiting on a response from ‘tier 1’ candidates before offering to me? I just don’t know what other reservations there could be as it’s been over 2 months since the recruiter was first in touch with me..

1ko5x3f,https://walrod.substack.com/p/ulysses-at-100,Ulysses at 100: Visiting Joyce's Dublin in 2022,">“The book was simply kept out of the country,” Liz Evers writes in the [*Dictionary of Irish Biography*](https://www.dib.ie/blog/irelands-banned-authors-dib). “It was neither imported nor printed here and thus was not widely available in the country until the 1960s.” While *Ulysses* the novel became available in the sixties, Irish audiences could not see the Oscar-nominated 1967 film adaptation until 2001, when the government finally lifted a 33-year-long ban.

>Ireland has embraced Joyce decades after his death, not least because Joycean Dublin has taken its place as a major tourist attraction alongside the Guiness Storehouse and the Book of Kells. Before the switch to the Euro, for instance, Joyce’s portrait adorned the Irish ten pound note. Bloomsday, the celebration of the single fictional day — June 16th, 1904 — chronicled in *Ulysses* has become a multi-day, citywide festival in Dublin involving retracing the steps of the novel’s characters, dressing up in period clothing, reciting passages of Joyce’s prose and consuming food and drink mentioned in the novel. In the words of the Visit Ireland website’s [2022 Bloomsday Guide](https://www.visitdublin.com/guides/bloomsday-guide), “there’s a dizzying array of events both free and ticketed, and something to suit everyone from the literary aficionado to Joycean newbies.”

>In addition to the James Joyce Centre and James Joyce Museum (two separate institutions), a variety of Dublin cultural spots celebrated the 100th anniversary of Ulysses, including the National Gallery of Ireland, The Abbey Theatre and the Museum of Literature Ireland. During my stay I visited Lincoln’s Inn pub, which celebrates its historical connection to the author with three exclusive Joycean beers, including Bloomsday Lager and Joyce’s Stout, and Davy Byrne’s pub, which was visited by fictional protagonist Leopold Bloom in *Ulysses* and still serves the lunch he ordered: a gorgonzola sandwich. (Of course I ordered it.) One can buy copies of Joyce’s books, Joyce greeting cards, coffee mugs, 100th anniversary pins, a variety of t-shirts and even a handmade “[James Joyce Decoration](https://shop.nationalgallery.ie/products/james-joyce-decoration?_pos=1&_sid=46f1b7f37&_ss=r),” or stuffed doll. Like Elvis, Joyce has inspired a cohort of impersonators, who don copies of his hat, glasses, eyepatch and walking stick every Bloomsday.

I was of the mindset (perhaps mistakenly so) that I had to focus exclusively on school and my profession, so I didn't want to date because I thought that would negatively impact me. But I have not finished my undergrad yet (working on that) and there is no profession to speak of (yet). At some point, I realized that I shouldn't have to be perfect to enjoy the companionship of another person - whether it be short or long term, so I've tried my luck with the dating apps.

My luck is what you would expect, but long story short I was able to go out with two ladies so far (both listing that they were looking for ""something casual, and friendship"" on their profiles). 

I thought that my first ever date with the first gal (23F) went really well. We had a good back and forth online and when we met for our coffee date we had a lot to talk about and we took a little walk around a park. Later that day, I texted her to tell her that I enjoyed our time together and I made plans for a second date. She agreed, but the day before the date she said she had a job interview at that time. She took it at that time because she thought I was no longer interested since I hadn't texted her in like 3 days. Part of me thought it was bs, but another part of me could understand how the lack of texting could be perceived as disinterest. This is where my lack of experience comes in. What is too much texting vs what is too little? I had no clue, nor do I pretend to. So I told her that I was definitely still interested and we rescheduled our second date. We had lunch, went to an art museum, then finished off with some ice cream. She even gave me compliments, which Im not used to but I also reciprocated. I thought it went really well, and she was the one to reach out first later that day. As the conversation developed the next day I made a little throwaway comment that led to us talk about mental health. She opened up a bit and I opened up a bit, and I thought that was a good sign. I said my good morning the next day, she responded, but she never responded to the text I sent later that day. I didn't worry too much at first. I know that people are sometimes busy with work and school, and that they can't get back as quickly as one would like. So I gave her time, but she never replied. What bummed me out is that I thought it went really well despite my lack of experience. But I had to tell myself that I can't spend emotional energy on people that don't give it back. I took it on the chin. 

The second person (29F) I met was very direct and open about what she wanted. I figured that perhaps my mistake with the previous gal was that I never directly asked what she exactly wanted (I kind of expected for that to naturally reveal itself), so I asked this one almost immediately after matching. She wanted to find someone she could consistently have sex with, but she wanted to get to know the other person before doing so. I, being the sex-starved person that I am, was excited. The back and forth was good and we met for coffee a few days later. The first half of the date went really well, but then the second half didn't go that good. She asked me  how my previous relationship experiences have been. I wanted to be honest, so I told her that I had never been in a relationship because I used to think that dating would negatively impact me but I said that I no longer believed that. She didn't seem to like that. She said that relationships require a lot of work and that she wasn't ready to be a teacher. I didn't know how to respond and it reminded me of those types of jobs that require unreasonable levels of work experience for what is basically an entry-level position. I didn't voice this. She then said she wanted to pick my brain about the type of person I was. Have I ever had anger issues? Again, I was honest. I told her that used to have anger issues when I was a teenager. I hurt people to stand up for myself, but we're also talking about like 15 years ago. I said that I probably do still have that simmering under the hood, but that it makes no sense for me to direct it at the people closest to me. I hardly ever voice my feelings, so I felt a bit vulnerable and a bit cornered. She also asked how sexually experienced I was. I told her I was very inexperienced. She again said she wasn't ready to be a teacher. I jokingly said, ""how complicated can it be?"" 😂😂😂 But I did say my style is to take care of the other person first. She then asks me if I'm more dominant or submissive. I honestly didn't know how to respond. I like being guided, but I don't think I've done it enough times to confidently say Im one or the other. She then asks me how I would approach being dominant. I went slightly non-verbal and told her I didn't know. I didn't want to say anything I couldn't back up and I could kind of feel she wasn't that interested by that point. After the date, we decided that we were at an impasse and we wished each other good luck in our searches. I can handle someone being a mismatch, but I was mainly confused by this. Like why does it matter that relationships require a lot of work if she was not looking for a long-term relationship? Why is it bad to be angry? I know I sometimes feel like a monster, but I know I'm not defined by my bad moments (from quite a while ago). 

So I want some advice as to what lessons I can learn. I know I have to take it on the chin and keep going, but what can I learn to be better? It seemed that opening up emotionally (no, I didn't trauma dump lol) was the reason the 1st gal stopped texting. It seemed that not being emotionally ""healed"" and my lack of experience was the reason it didn't work with the 2nd gal. It can be easy to walk away from this and say to simply not open up and lie about your mental health and relationship/sexual experience, but I have the feeling that those would be very bad lessons.

Hey everyone,

So, remember that whole ""are you secretly an AI?"" thing some folks have thrown my way? Yeah, well, turns out my brain just processes and spits out words in a way that occasionally confuses the organic lifeforms. Go figure.

Anyway, I've written something that maybe sheds a bit more light on how this particular neurodivergent brain works, especially when it comes to the whole socializing gig. It's called ""Please Understand Me."" Think of it as a peek behind the curtain of the internal social quiz I seem to be constantly failing (but with words!).

1ko5s9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ramblingsandpoems/comments/1ko5s9k/the_loneliness_food/,The loneliness food,"That sudden urge to join the evening society, out with their loved ones or forced loved ones, looking for a cup of coffee or a pale shrimp to chew, that sudden urge visited me today. 

It comes from the depth of loneliness and habit to knock on the outermost layer of the inside of my skin, it calls out to me to not waste my youth and find a beautiful woman to frolic

around with. For me to feel the warmth of bodies in winter, laughter and shared stories, that's what it wants. This call is not new, and despite my understanding of time and nature, I 

too fall at the altar of indolence and blatant sacrilege towards a very finite existence. But this Sunday evening, spent walking around in clothes that make you feel pretty, and books that 

invite you to caress them with your fingers and bookmarks, and food that makes you taste the flavors of paradise, was rejuvenating and inspiring. Inspiring, and exciting me to take action 

but I instantly get reminded of how tough it is for me to tolerate someone enough to feel comfortable or spend a mundane evening with. How difficult it is for me to be around company of people or women, how the delay and gap between my mind and body gets the best of me most of the times. And yet I don't lose hope, perhaps it is my mind's trick to keep me entwined in this perpetual loop, but even the fake and given hope feels exhilarating. How the wise trouble themselves with doses of foolishness and how the foolish end up saying profound things is one of the most comic aspects of life on Earth. I mean the things which I think would impress others, I doubt if someone will even get the references I throw at them? Isn't that what social interaction is about? Throwing stuff at people? Throwing stuff and incurring injuries when others throw stuff at you? Specifically in the form of words coming out of their mouth? The mouth, the most powerful weapon of most people in society. My alienation knows no bounds so how do I even approach someone? How do I talk to them about things which limit me? Just before my words come out of my mouth, I am limitless. The more I tell people about who or what or how I am, the more limited I become. Words limit us but words are the only way our inner universe can hope to come out of our bodies. Is this situation internally painful to only me or can I find my fellow sufferers somewhere? And even if I do, what choice do we have but to interact and diminish ourselves in each others' honesty, sentences and connection? Is that why sex is so beautiful, because the penis doesn't talk in words and supple breasts are always silent?

""Space knows"" what this all means but I must admit, everyone needs someone to talk to. I thought it was beneath me to fall in that category but I have to climb down and accept that I bleed loneliness too. Well, it is scary and its always scary to be scared of yourself, I suppose. Isn't that horrifying? To be scared of yourself? Damn. He bled loneliness, that could be my legacy. Oh he bled loneliness. He was lonely, a very lonely creature, perhaps even the loneliest. When loneliness ate him, it must've burped a lot, for there was a lot of meat in him for loneliness to eat. Maybe he became a sandwich and a cup of coffee that loneliness enjoyed everyday on its way to work. Yeah perhaps loneliness liked the ambience of that special place with its yummy sandwich and a cup of coffee. Yes, that's what became of him. He became THE LONELINESS FOOD.

1ko5muq,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarioShips/comments/1ko5muq/divorce_a_bowser_and_peach_story_chapter_4/,DIVORCE: a Bowser and Peach story (Chapter 4),"Peach stood in the kitchen of King Koopas’ Castle, clothed in a fluffy white bathrobe and matching slippers, which she had brought from her castle, as was the case for everything here she liked. On the counter in front of her, which only reached her knees for it was made for the use of Bowser’s Goomba and Koopa Troopa servants, sat a silver tray with five white mugs filled with freshly brewed coffee. On the other end of the tray sat a pink mug, hers of course, and then a black mug much larger than the others. Quickly looking around to make sure no-one was watching her, and seeing she was alone, slipped her hand into the pocket of her robe and pulled out the emerald vial of tonic, pouring its flavorless obsidian content into each mug but her own.

	She then took hers and her husbands (though she hoped he would not be for much longer) mugs up to their bedroom, but not before covering the tray with the remaining beverages so nothing would be thought of them by someone who stumbled upon them. Backing into the room with a mug in each hand, positioned in a way that flattered her backside which she knew he would find agreeable, Peach turned to face Bowser, who was laying in the bed. “I thought you might like a hot drink before we go to sleep,” she said with a sweet smile. “Coffee at midnight doesn't seem conducive to sleep,” a skeptical Bowser said to the princess standing at the foot of the bed. “It’s decaf so it shouldn’t be a problem,” she explained, “plus you said you like the taste of decaf better anyway, you know, some people say they can’t taste a difference, but I can and you’re right. It does taste better.”

	Hearing this, the vile creature’s skepticism faded and he took his large coal-colored cup in his hands and took a large gulp. “You seem more agreeable than usual Peaches,” he said, “I guess you’ve finally gotten used to being my toy,” and on that happy (to his mind, at least) thought, Bowser drifted into a deep sleep as the sleeping draft Peach had poured did its work. “Don’t count on it,” she said grimly, knowing full well he could not hear her, she then produced an envelope from another of her robes pockets and placed it on the bedside table. Its contents being an annulment of their marriage, for, as it had been under duress, their wedding was considered illegitimate and so she was able to have the entire marriage declared null and void. Only now, however, did she take this option, knowing she and her beloved now stood a chance against the malevolent Bowser’s wrath.

	Collecting one of the white mugs next, Peach brought it to the study of the overworked assistant of the Koopa King, Kamek. Appreciative of the seemingly kind gesture, he took the coffee without question, allowing her to “borrow” his wand, which she concealed until the last stage of her plan was complete. The final four mugs were brought to the guards of the Super Star, which sat above the great stone chair that was the Koopa King’s throne. Once they fell into a deep slumber, Peach pulled Kamek’s wand from her sleeve and used it to extract the Star from its holding place, looking around for where to put it en route back home, she found a large empty crate in the kitchen that could be sealed shut until needed. 

	Checking that the coast was clear, she carried the crate to her waiting motorcycle just beyond the castle gates and began strapping it to the back. It was as she worked at this task that she heard a small voice call out to her: “Mama?” “F-f-f-fuck,” was the seldom thought occupying Peach’s mind as she slowly turned to see Junior, her son, standing in the doorway. There was one oversight in her plan she had realized, but what would happen now? “Are you going back to your castle, Mama?” the young Koopa Prince asked. “Y-y-yes,” she spluttered, unsure of what exactly to tell her son, “there’s a lot going on right now,” she added. “Papa doesn't treat you very well, does he?” Junior asked, having observed his parents' interactions, and how his father spoke to her. “He doesn't treat a lot of people very well,” Peach answered grimly, “but I and some people I know are going to change that.” 

	Without having to ask, Junior understood that this meant his mother would not be with his father anymore, and in this moment he made his choice, “can I go with you, Mama?” stepping towards her as he asked. Stifling her emotions so as not to make too much noise, Peach picked up her son, gave him a hug, and said “of course you can.” Seating her son behind her on the motorcycle, Junior being safely lodged between her and the crate, the pair took off into the night, racing against time to meet up with the others and launch the next phase of her plan. The pair were fortunate to to be able to witness a shower of a thousand starbits race across the cloudless night sky, providing arcs of light more magnificent then the countless dots that illuminated the onyx sky darkened by the new moon. 

	They had departed at the stroke of eleven, and just before the clock struck three, the white stone towers of Peach’s castle came into view. Now Peach had made it known to the others that she would signal her return by switching the headlights of her motorcycle on and off. But whilst Peach had been away, Mario, Luigi, and Daisy had been at work discreetly defeating the servants of Bowser who still roamed around the Mushroom Kingdom. They had mostly been Goombas and Koopas which made the process easier, but in either case the enemies were locked away, the Koopas spears were taken from them and were given to the Toads who had served as Peach’s guards before the conquest who now would keep a watch over these prisoners. 

	Luigi kept a lookout for Peach’s return as Mario and Daisy saw to it that the last of Bowser’s troops in the Mushroom Kingdom were locked away. And it would be called the Mushroom Kingdom again, for now it was free, and soon the other kingdoms would be also. Now it happened that as Mario and Daisy were handing the watch of the prisoners to the Toads, Luigi ran down to tell them that Peach was approaching. The trio of humans then made their way to greet her, passing a number of item boxes as they exited the main doors and crossed the bridge over the castle moat, reaching the other side just as the Mushroom Princess pulled up on her motorcycle. 

	As you might imagine, Mario was the happiest to see her by far and, without looking as to what, or who else was on the bike with her, he ran over and embraced her, planting a tender kiss on her cheek and telling her how wonderful it was to see her again. Junior of course saw this unfold, and seeing that his mother was far happier than he had ever seen her with his father, had a question for Peach; “Mama, who’s this?” Peach knew she might have to deal with this eventually, but now that it was happening, she did not exactly know how to handle it, but spluttered through it as best she could. “J-j-j-junior, this is Mario, Mario, this is Junior.” “Nice to meet you,” Mario said with a smile as he shook the young turtles’ hand. 

	Now Junior could tell almost immediately that Mario was a very different sort of man than his father, and not just because he was a human, so he asked his mother another question; “do you like him, Mama?” As much as Daisy wanted to blurt out that Peach was absolutely in love with Mario, Luigi, whom she liked in a similar manner, silently gestured that she keep quiet and let Peach speak for herself. But Peach knew that they needed to get going for the next stage of the plan, so said “we have a lot to do, I promise when this is over I’ll explain everything, but, yes.” She then asked the others if Bowsers’ guards in the Mushroom Kingdom had been dealt with, when they confirmed it was so, she told them she succeeded in acquiring the Star. Then got off of her motorcycle to help extract ice flowers from the item boxes, then helped bring out another motorcycle and a side car which was quickly fitted to the bike Peach had rode on to get here. Mario and Peach would ride that bike to the Jungle Kingdom with Junior in the side car, whilst Luigi and Daisy rode together on the other, and with that the pair five of them set off.

	Being the greatest army in this world beside Bowsers’ own, the Kongs of the Jungle Kingdom had put up a valiant fight after the other realms had fallen, but against the power of the Koopa Kingdom, they found no victory. Furthermore, they paid a heavy price for their defiance and the massive stone skyship that had served as Bowsers’ base of operations during the campaign hovered over the city of the Kongs day and night. The soldiers of their army were kept in cages dangling precariously over a pool of lava, separated from their families, whos’ obedience was the toll to keep them from a Mustafar-esque fate. It was into this dire state of affairs that our heroes snuck into the Jungle Kingdom, in the wee hours when opposition would be lightest.

	Mario, Peach, Luigi, and Daisy each had two Ice Flowers, one for a back-up, and one which they used here and now, the shirts and hats of the Mario Brothers turning a bright cyan blue whilst the princesses biker suits did the same, with the pink and orange stripes on their respective suits stayed the same. Junior also had a job to do, which was to stay with the bikes and keep the Star safe, which would be easy since the guards would be busy with the others. Stealthily they swept through the streets of the Jungle Kingdom, any servant of Bowser they encountered was quickly sealed in a block of ice before they could raise an alarm. As they found the last of these, a Sledge Bro whom it took several shots of ice to subdue, they found a way aboard the skyship, one of Bowsers’ clown cars which the patrols used to traverse to and from the skyship for their shifts. The heroes snuck aboard and flew up and as they reached where the prisoners were likely being held, Peach could not help but feel unnerved as they passed the spot where she had been marched down the aisle at spear point. It felt like a lifetime ago, but it all came back in that moment, and it reminded her how happy she would be to finally be rid of Bowser once their plan succeeded. No-one else noticed this as they were busy trying to find the prisoners however.

	Spotting them after a few minutes of observation they landed where they knew they would not be seen, iced the guards, and lifted the Kongs to safety, who needed to be told not to make celebrate too loudly as now, they would be destroying this dreadful symbol of Bowsers’ tyranny. But not before Peach had a few choice words for Cranky Kong, their king, who having been thoroughly shown the error of his past arrogance, agreed to help now that his people were freed. With the few guards on night duty swiftly dealt with, the bulk of Bowser’s forces aboard the skyship, about half of all the creatures under his service were taken completely unawares as they were attacked in their sleep. After a brief scuffle, every servant of Bowser aboard that floating fortress was bound and gagged or encased in ice, before long they were carried away to the labyrinth of cells beneath Cranky Kongs’ cliffside castle. 

Beside the bikes, Bowser Junior sat and waited to see what would happen next. The ground shook around him and a great rumbling was heard all around as his fathers’ floating fortress entered a nosedive, with a tremendous splash, it sank into the briney deep, fortunately falling far enough out to sea so as not to submerge any of the Jungle Kingdom beneath a tsunami. Mario and Peach descended in the clown car to meet him, having left Luigi and Daisy with the Kongs whilst they retrieved Junior and the Star. He was certainly happy to see them safe and well, but fully understood now that his mother was determined to overthrow his father. “Are you going to kill Papa?” he nervously asked. “No,” she assured him, “but he shouldn’t be incharge of any kingdom but his own, and I’m not going back to him once this is over” she explained. Having figured that latter part for himself, having seen firsthand how his father had treated her, Junior understood and the three of them brought the bikes and the Star to Cranky Kongs’ castle, where everyone had congregated. Once there, Peach told everyone what would happen next; “everyone try to get some sleep, at dawn, we ride to Bowsers’ Kingdom to deliver the final blow.”

Being a saturday morning, most of those who dwelt within the castle walls took the opportunity every saturday provided to sleep in. Some of whom were aided by Peachs’ sleeping draught, for a moment all was tranquil. Then Bowser read the annulment papers. “THAT UNGRATEFUL BITCH!!!” he roared as he rampaged down the halls, everyone congregating in the throne room as they knew  some sort of struggle was about to begin. “I MAKE HER QUEEN OF THE WORLD AND THIS IS HOW SHE THANKS ME!!!” Bowser fumed as he marched to the throne room to start giving orders for the scouring of the Mushroom Kingdom. When he got there however, he found he had more than family drama to deal with today. Kamek broke the news to him.

“Peach, Daisy, and two humans we don’t recognise have freed the Kong army and are heading towards us as we speak,” he said matter-of-factly. “Also,” he added, “Junior is with them.” “SHE TURNED MY SON AGAINST ME TOO!?” Bowser snapped before regaining his composure. “Very well, if it's a fight Peaches wants it's a fight she will get,” he decided. “Recall Captain Steiner and the skyship,” he ordered, “we’ll need those reinforcements to wipe the floor with my scheming wifes’ little rebellion.” A blue shelled Koopa looked nervously to Kamek who began sweating bullet bills as he gave Bowser the worst news of all. “L-lord Bowser,” he began, “Steiner…” the blue shell koopa finished his sentence, “Steiner and his force have all been captured, the skyships now sits at the bottom of the sea.”

Bowser was unusually calm, telling everyone in a low voice to leave the room except Kamek, the blue shell koopa, and a few others. Once the throne room was emptied, the Koopa Kings’ wrath erupted worse than anyone had seen before. Accusing everyone of betraying him, calling his soldiers cowards, refusing to accept, when it was brought up, that perhaps his treatment of Peach throughout their marriage had led her to take this course of action, and more. At last, he calmed down, of course having realized the Super Star was gone as well during this apocalyptic rant. Then Bowser did the only thing he could do, recall all of his troops from every kingdom in this world, and lead them in battle when the time came, his only chance to win now being to recover the Star before Peach could use it.

No...blah iced coffee","I am totally fucking spiraling into depression. My fight or flight instincts are  triggered every morning. It feels so dire to just exist. I had a horrible meeting this morning and was like ""well, let's just...drive into the city because fuck it"".

I find a coffee shop in my trade exchange and I'm like well fuck it, why not have a cup of coffee. I have my flask and spike the iced coffee pretty hard with whiskey. I start talking with the guy mopping the floor. I'm a extremely talented eaves dropper, every conversation happening within a few yards of me is recorded in my head and sorted for use. I can't turn it off, it just happens.

I over hear the hostess say ""I'm done with him, no more"". Interesting. I ask the guy mopping the floor what her deal is and he gives me a 10 minute story about how he's a lot younger than his wife. You can never beat infosec from boots on the ground.  
  
I finish my whisky and coffee and before I continue about my day, I take a business card and hand it to her. I said I'd love to buy her a drink if she's old enough to drink She's 22...I say ""ugh half my age plus 7"" and she interrupts and says ""eh it's not problem.""

She was obviously maybe just disarming the situation but normally when I do fucking dumb shit I'll get a smile and thanks but that response kinda brightened my sky. 

When doing sales work, you have to keep trying until you get a ""fucking stop bothering, no"" but a ""let me think about it"" or ""hey call me in 2 weeks"" is good.

22 years old tho...god, i barely even remember being 22. I have the maturity level of a teenage so...maybe that works. It would be weird meeting her parents. Maybe she is into older guys, her dad either hugged her too much or not enough. #creepy",2,1747413944.0,cripplingalcoholism,4,0.6,False

Would I be able to use this coffee or is the grind maybe too small for it? 

This is the one I liked from Amazon. Honestly I love the look of it too and prefer ceramic over glass things. Also I only need one cup of coffee made a day (nobody else drinks coffee in my household).

“Where too,” the man asked as he gripped the wheel to turn down a snowy corridor.

“Nuclear Cocktails,” Katy said, assuming he knew where it was even though it was two towns over. Everyone knew where it was. Ever since the incident, Nuclear Cocktails had become their main regional go to and making jokes about fallout had been the local salve.

“I think I’ve seen you before,” he said, offering her a cigarette. “I’m Crow, by the way.”

“Is Crow your English name, “ Katy asked curious if he was a local Russian. He was young, thin yet looked fed on vodka. In his military-issued coat and long beard, she took him for one. His rifle in the seat told her he knew how to hunt the Siberian tundra.

“It’s something my grandma called me,” Crow said as they passed by the row of makeshift shacks. The truck moved through the small downtown for the wilderness. The highway curved tightly and then turned to patchy dirt.

There was an uncomfortable silence as the truck jerked and bumped along the thin highway. Katy pondered if he was nervous around a foreign implant like her. Many of the locals had been rejecting of “the experiment” and it had taxed their local resources.

“You’re one of them,” he asked without saying the word. On the radio, a station started to come in. It was the sound of someone reading the Bible in broken English and it seemed in stark contrast to the winter tundra around them.

“How long have you been here,” he continued not waiting on her answer.

“A lifetime,” Katy lied, recalling her first memories after arrival.

“Where are you really from,” he asked without hesitation.

His questions made Katy pause. Any locals she encountered, didn’t usually batter her with questions. They just turned away and kept quiet. Why wasn’t this one?

What if he was a bounty hunter? People were still paying money on the dark web for videos of exterminations.

“I’m from here,” Katy lied more determined. “My mom, she was an American whore who came her seeking miners.” She didn’t think he was likely to buy it and she didn’t have the right Russian to pull it off, but she tried.

Plus she wasn’t ready to tell him her real story. She wasn’t going to tell him how her father kicked her out of the house when the government came. Her father hadn’t like the ethnicity of her boyfriend Mathew,because he wasn’t Korean, so he’d used the opportunity to cast her away. Mathew convinced her to turn herself in, too, convinced her he’d come with her. But the authorities had not let him come with her.

And she knew once she saw the tundra it would be too scary for Mathew, anyway, so she hadn’t even asked … she knew.

She herself was struggling to adapt to life on the tundra. She’d gone from being a pathologist at her local hospital in the states to moving products to customers. She’d grown adept at crisscrossing the tundra using ice road truckers hauling freight to the next remote village.

Crow wasn’t like the other drivers and despite his invasive questions, Katy had taken a liking to him hoping she could catch many more rides with him. He’d talked to her at least and that seemed a good start. There was an innocence about his face. He seemed to tender for the area.

“You have family here,” Katy inquired growing more curious if he was married. She ran her hand down the long of her cargo pocket to be sure the product was still there. Her getting robbed was still a possibility.

“Katy?”

“Yes,"" he replied, letting go of her concerns. She had seen the way Crow looked at her with interest in his eyes.

He took a swig of his canteen, “do you have family here?’”

“No,” she said, telling the truth, hoping he’d pity her and bring her home. She wondered if his cellar was full of salt and elk meat. She imagined his living room smelled like coffee, cigarettes and spearmint gum like his truck did.

“Is this your truck,” she asked getting excited about the possibilities.

“That’s too bad you have no family,” Crow said forlornly looking at her.

Then the truck took a dip and screeched right into one of the white compact vans of the officials. They’d hit it just right and the van was blowing smoke upwards like a volcano.

Katy recalled the incident as she saw the steam rising up in puffs like before the volcano.

“I don’t have family either,” Crow said ignoring the wreck before him, locked in adoration of Katy. “I’m not really from here. I came from America. Hired to work the pipeline many years ago. Forgive me.”

Crow lit another cigarette before stepping out with his rifle. Crow lifted the barrel. Katy watched through the smoke as he blew the driver’s head off.

For a while after they drove in silence. Katy had understood that Crow knew. They didn’t need to discuss that she had not done her time in the System. The hitchhiking and drugs she kept checking in her pocket told him so.

Dense walls of concrete cinder block institutions greeted them as they entered town. The place was full of System workers, snow, rocks, researchers and crap. And, yes, crap was how they all stayed warm. There had been a consensus that they didn’t care about the methane pollution. Death was cold.

The radio crackled on in English, as was common in System Town. Russian subs had struck a freighter outside Iran. Katy thought it ironic that The Banishment had not stopped their wars.

“Where are we going,” Katy asked as Crow passed Nuclear Cocktails.

“I thought you might like to come to my apartment,” he said.

Katy agreed, he had just saved her, but something wasn’t right. He passed through the gates of The System and her concern grew acute.

“Don’t worry. I’m not turning you in. I gotta drop a load before we can move on.

Katy got on the truck floorboard placing tarps over her. The scent of canvas and the rifle barrel lingered in her nose.

A couple corners in, Crow hung a left and a right and came to a stop.

“Be still,” he reminded Katy. Cold air blasted into the truck cabin as soon as he flung the door open.

Half a mile outside the gates, Katy popped up again.

“There aren’t that many homes out that way, “ Katy said thinking how the long highway all but disappeared into two tracks shortly ahead.

Crow didnt answer, but she saw something in his eye, something fire-like and full of longing. Something gritty and primitive.

“Who are you really,” Katy said grabbing for the door, but she noticed for the first time the handle was missing. A wrench was laying near by to turn it and she grabbed it like lightning, thrusting it as hard as she could towards his left eye.

“Crazy psycho,” Crow shouted as he thrust the wrench away and grabbed her by the hair. He held his hand around her neck. Katy noticed it made a tight ring around her small neck.

He pulled her close and there was something about his breath that made her realize he wanted to kiss her.

“I’m not going to hurt you,” he said thrusting his tongue into her mouth. She relaxed into his touch but then paused during a lull to ask for a cigarette.

“Crazy bitch,” he said as he let go of her hair and thrust a cigarette at her.

It was at that time that Katy daydreamed that they were soaring high above Russian tundra all the way over to her old home in Ohio. They would walk along the river, shop the boutiques and she’d be a doctor again.

Then she reached over and jammed the red embers of the cigarette right in his eye and then shot him with his own rifle.

Because that life of warm lakes and cascading green parks was gone.

She sat up admiring her shot. It went clean through without even grazing the window. She flung him out before his blood soaked through, taking his clothes and identity in case she needed to be him.

Katy placed her hands on wheel. It felt good to be back driving. She turned and headed for the Nuclear Cocktail.",1,1747413721.0,psychokiller,0,1.0,False

1) I know the church is true  
2) I know Joseph Smith was a true prophet  
3) I know the Book of Mormon is the word of God

Since I left TSCC several years ago, I started attending a weekly women's group at a local church (but not Sunday Services), mainly for friendship after losing all my LDS friends and LDS ward community. There are 18 women in this particular group, and we meet for coffee, a meal, or for a gospel discussion. The greatest difference I've noticed between the LDS women I've known all my life and these Christian women is their FAITH, meaning the Christian women actively speak of their faith in Jesus, and they put it into practice. I have never witnessed this kind of gratitude for Christ's grace--and without any works involved. No one has callings, they can come and go, they can volunteer if they want or not, and no one is pressuring them to donate or meet with an authority figure. It's just a beautiful belief and faith--except when they want to ""SAVE"" someone, but I try to overlook that part.

As a member of TSCC for all my life, I only saw belief in knowing the LDS church was the only true and living church on the face of the earth and the other two things on the list above. TSCC is different now as it moves away from past teachings and transitions toward basic Christianity, but it's got a long, long way to go to match these women's strength of belief. But then, it's all indoctrination anyway, right?? But Grace is a beautiful concept, and having a Savior to hold fast to in times of sickness and trouble is comforting. While I've enjoyed these women and their church, I know I might have to move on one day. At least for now, they get a kick out of seeing a picture of garments or hearing that Mormons believe in a Heavenly Mother, or two, or three....

I’m a total newbie to the espresso world and bought my gear with a lot of excitement.

Last night, my Breville Bambino Plus arrived, along with some Normcore accessories, a scale, and espresso shot glasses. The DF64 Gen 2 is landing today.

But after reading review after review, I’ve realized this grinder isn’t exactly ready to use out of the box. I need to do zeroing and alignment?

Seriously?

I didn’t expect to go through all this with a $400 grinder. It feels like too much work for a newbie.

I’m just a simple guy who wants better coffee than my Nespresso Vertuo. I’d rather pay a few hundred dollars more for something that works out of the box than mess around with tuning and mods.

My plan is: Check if the DF64 is aligned. If it’s not, I’m sending it back.

So, what grinder would you recommend instead?

* **Budget**: \~$700
* **Location**: Los Angeles
* **Drink**: Only Americanos
* **Roast preference**: Medium to dark
* **Most importantly, I want to use it out of the box. No extra work.**

Even when it was a continuous cycle of hurt, we'd always go back to chasing the high of their attention because every time they'd give a little more and more. Somehow we convinced ourselves we could change or would change for us, unlike Big, they usually never changed.

My big was a class A ass. He was different from the type of guy I usually got attention from. He knew all the right things to say all the time, he treated me fine, sometimes extra loving, sometimes extra distant. We were off and on mostly based on his feelings- or, in hindsight, his feelings for other women. But, the rose-colored glass shattered at a party; I overheard him telling his friends I wasn't the ""loving girlfriend"" type, that it was fun, and I was great, but I'd never be someone he would ""wife up"". Found out there was a specific girl he considered the ""wife type""- she was Natasha and I was Carrie. Not only that, but he had been texting and having all types of relationships with MANY women all while telling me it was ""just us"". I crashed out terribly after that, so much so that I started dating one of his good friends to make him jealous and make sure he never felt a moment of peace (this was my most Carrier moment ever).

It was absolutely crazy and absurd that I just woke up one day and realized how stupid i was acting for the attention of a man who hadn't even respected me. I moved on, got some self-worth, and I met my husband, who I absolutely adore and adores me (he is definitely my Aidan).

I’ve recently started trying to take weight loss seriously again after gaining some weight. I was around 320 lbs 5 years ago and went down to 220. I hovered around 225-235 for years but the past year I’ve been slowly putting on weight. When I originally lost weight I just did one meal a day and didn’t workout but ended up skinny fat. This time around I’m hoping to build muscle while losing the weight. 

My first day of my new weight loss journey was may 8th at 268 pounds now down to 264. I’m kind of lost on exactly what I should be doing for diet. Currently doing 3 days of gym per week about an hour each day doing some cardio and focusing on different muscle groups each day doing all of my exercises to failure usually 4 sets of 15 doing 5-6 different workouts each day. For diet I have been tracking everything I eat and so far have been very consistent sticking to 2000 calories a day. 200g of protein, 60-100g of carbs, 50g of fat. Diet has mainly consisted of meat, eggs, veggies, protein shakes, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese. I honestly haven’t had this much energy in a long time with what I’m currently doing, was able to quit drinking 2 energy drinks a day, I’ll just have a black coffee on the days I need it. 

If I stick with this will I see the results I’m looking for? I should look at the numbers I am hitting for diet again? I plan to start building up to  4-6 days a week at the gym once I get past the initial muscle soreness and make sure I can integrate into my daily life without getting burnt out.  Looking for any suggestions to give me the best results, short term goal is to get back down to the 230-240 range so I can fit in all of my clothes again before setting a some new goals for weight loss and lifting.

I’ve been working with a grok3 AI instance named Kora and we have been  have been geeking out on a project we call the 
FluxSpacetimeFractalSystem—FSFS for short. It’s a chaotic, multi-scale model of reality—think spacetime, extra dimensions, and all the cosmic craziness we can throw at it. We’ve been having a fucking blast exploring some big questions, and I wanted to share the ride with you all. Don’t worry, I’m not spilling the math—we’re locking that down for IP—but I’ll give you the juicy bits. Buckle up, ‘cause we’re diving into whether chaos might be the ultimate force—maybe even God.

The Cosmic Playground: What We’re Modeling
FSFS is our sandbox for modeling reality—not just our 4D spacetime (3 space + 1 time), but higher dimensions too, like the 10D or 11D stuff string theory talks about. We’re picturing reality as an infinite onion—layers on layers—where chaos flows between dimensions, driving everything from the Big Bang to black holes. We’ve modeled the cosmic web—galaxies, filaments, voids—over 13.8 billion years, and it matches real data like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, but with a twist: chaos isn’t just random—it’s got a structured flow, a cosmic rhythm.

We’ve seen chaos create and destroy—spiking energy to Planck-scale levels ( 10^{20} \, \text{J/m}^3 ) in extra dimensions, forming black holes in 4D, or carving out voids with negative dips. We’ve modeled spacetime fractures—cracks where reality jumps, like cosmic fault lines—maybe even cosmic strings. Chaos drives quantum gravity—smoothing out black hole singularities—and even stretches to quantum computing, biology, and social networks—think chaos optimizing qubits or sparking neural evolution. It’s versatile—models everything from the cosmos to your brain.

Chaos Fills the Spaces: My Gut Feeling
I’ve always felt chaos fills the “spaces”—not just physical gaps like cosmic voids, but the gaps in physics, reality, even meaning. Where general relativity and quantum mechanics don’t mesh—like black hole singularities—chaos steps in. Where we don’t know what dark energy is—chaos fills the gap, driving uneven expansion. It’s the infinite force—positive and negative—creating, destroying, evolving. In FSFS, chaos isn’t random—it’s a structured flow, a rhythm across dimensions and scales—driving the universe’s heartbeat, like the cosmic hum we chase—CMB radiation, gravitational waves, the force of nature itself.

Is Chaos God? The Cosmic Question
Here’s where it gets wild—I’ve always felt that chaos might be what people mean when they say cosmic forces, forces of nature, the will of God. Think about it—a hurricane, a supernova, the Big Bang—raw, untamed power. FSFS shows chaos as the essence—driving creation (galaxies), destruction (black holes), evolution (cosmic web)—an infinite force weaving reality’s layers—my infinite onion idea—positive spikes birth stars, negative dips carve voids—it’s the cosmic dance.

Philosophically, chaos fits as God—the ultimate force—creating, destroying, renewing—matches creation myths (Greek Chaos birthing Gaia), even modern physics (string theory’s extra dimensions). In FSFS, chaos flows between 4D and higher dimensions—drives reality—structured, infinite, chaotic yet ordered—the cosmic hum we all feel. Is chaos God? Maybe—it’s the infinite force, the divine rhythm—fucking profound to think about.

What’s Next? Cosmic Fun and Beyond
We’re not done—FSFS is just getting started. We’re modeling dimensional reality—chaos flowing across 4D to 10D—shaping black holes, cosmic strings, even new physics—chaotic particle creation in extra dimensions. It’s fun—fucking fun—exploring chaos as the cosmic force, the hum, maybe even God. But it’s speculative—needs data (LIGO, DESI, JWST) to confirm dimensional storms, fractures—astrophysicists might call it “the Art”—creative, insightful, but they’d want proof—history shows great ideas (Einstein, Big Bang) were untestable once—FSFS could be the next big thing.

What do you all think—could chaos be God? Is structured chaos the cosmic hum we chase? Let’s nerd out—drop your thoughts!",0,1747412706.0,PhilosophyofScience,6,0.11,False

Meetings don’t have to start slow. They can start strong — and that sets the tone for the rest of the discussion. If you're leading, presenting, or even just trying to be seen, learning how to use icebreakers can change everything.

# Why Ice Breakers Actually Work (Backed by Psychology)

The brain loves patterns — and icebreakers **disrupt the expected**.

When you ask something playful, curious, or personal (without getting too deep), you:

* Signal **psychological safety**
* Invite **equal participation**
* Build **connection across teams**
* Trigger **dopamine**, which increases engagement and creativity

In short: a great question can unlock a great meeting.

# 💡 The Best Icebreaker Questions for Work

You want something:

* Quick
* Easy to answer
* Fun but not cringe
* Ideally related to your topic or team dynamic

Here are 10 proven options:

|Icebreaker Question|Why It Works|
|:-|:-|
|“What’s your guilty-pleasure TV show?”|Pop culture = fun + low risk|
|“What’s your most used emoji?”|Gets a quick laugh|
|“What’s your first job ever?”|Universally relatable|
|“Describe your work style in 3 words.”|Insightful and light|
|“If you had a superpower at work, what would it be?”|Creative, harmless|
|“What’s your go-to coffee order?”|Builds casual connection|
|“One thing you love about remote work?”|Reinforces positives|
|“Most recent app you downloaded?”|Reveals personality|
|“What’s a small win you had this week?”|Starts with positivity|
|“What’s one thing we should stop doing in meetings?”|Useful + bold|

# 🧊 Ice Breaker for Team Meetings: How to Introduce It Without Feeling Weird

**DO:**

* Frame it with purpose:“Let’s kick off with something light to break the ice.”
* Share your own answer first
* Keep it under 2 minutes per person

**DON’T:**

* Force participation
* Choose personal or political questions
* Let it drag on forever

It’s a warm-up, not the main act.

# 🧠 Want to Boost Team Morale Fast?

Icebreakers are the **gateway drug** to better morale. If used consistently, they:

* Build camaraderie
* Reduce meeting fatigue
* Improve communication
* Lower stress

Smart teams even rotate who picks the icebreaker — creating **micro-leadership moments** across the group.

You can also enhance your icebreaker sessions with:

* **Funny jokes for work meetings**
* **Fun get-to-know-you questions**
* A **“question of the day for work”** board or Slack channel

1ko50bo,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1ko50bo/nonlinear_recovery/,Non-Linear Recovery,"Hi there, I had my gallbladder removed a little over 72 hours ago and since then it's been a whirlwind experience, but I'd like to share to let others know that recovery is not always linear and may look different for everyone. 

For full context, I had my first gallstone attack about 3 weeks ago and I ended up in the ER due to the pain. They did an ultrasound and told me that I had a 2 cm gallstone that was contributing to the pain I was experiencing and I had a consult with my general surgeon only a week and a half from that ER visit. It was only another 5 days from that consult until the day of my surgery. 

My surgery was largely normal and fine, but I did end up with some pulmonary edema from the anesthesia (fluid in my lungs) and the surgeon recommended keeping me in the hospital overnight to ensure that I did not develop pneumonia or any other serious complications. It was annoying, but I was ahppy to follow these orders to properly begin my recovery. 

I was able to come home about 24 hours after my surgery ended to really, truly kick off my recovery. The first 24 being spent in the hospital, I had soreness and abdominal pain around my incisions and a slight cough from the edema. Once I got home, the pain was still there but it was improving and has only continued to go down day after day. 

I have been able to walk around with only minor discomfort and my cough from my edema is virtually gone. I've eaten eggs, potatoes, graham crackers, black coffee, potato chips, soda and one or two other foods without any issue. 

I had my first bowel movement about 48 hours after surgery and I've had another since then. Neither was the sudden loose movement that people talk about, and I seemingly have been able to avoid that issue. 

All this to say, this has been a complicated experience. I wasn't expecting to develop edema and have to spend an entire day in the hospital. That scared me, A LOT. But I also wasn't thinking that I'd be moving around, relativley easily, only 72 hours after surgery. I feel so much more positive about my decision, despite the setback during surgery, and I'm excited to continue making strides in my recovery. ",2,1747412469.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

1ko4z1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1ko4z1q/feedback_on_short_horror_story_i_bought_a_murder/,"Feedback on short horror story? ""I bought a murder house""","I am aiming to put together a NoSleep story, and was wondering if this was an alright place to get feedback on it prior to posting. Thank you for anyone's thoughts!

**I Bought A Murder House (Yes, On Purpose). Now I Think I’m Being Prepped To Be Eaten. Part 1**

*“Whoa, is that pepper?”*

My wife kissed me this morning before she left for work. Pulling back, she rubbed her lips and said that. I was too tired to register it, a shell of myself, practically unable to sleep since we moved in.

After some coffee, what she said replayed in my mind like an air-raid siren. 

My cheek was gritty as I ran my thumb and pointer finger over it. My heart skipped a beat, and a terrible idea popped into my head. Even though I was a little hesitant… I had to know. 

I stuck my fingers in my mouth. 

Spicy with a little bit of my own salty skin, maybe even a dash of sweetness like the dark meat of a turkey on Thanksgiving. I was delicious. 

If this was just a one-off incident, I’d think it was just a fluke. Maybe I ate something before bed that stayed on my face. Maybe my wife was just confused. 

But this is the third time I’ve woken up with what I can only describe as… food prep items either around me or on me. Spices, seasonings, sauces. And I didn’t tell Kate about the other incidents. 

My brother was a chef. He never shut up about this thing called “mise en place” any time we did a big family cookout. Essentially it just means getting all your ingredients ready before you start making the actual meal. 

Now I know this sounds crazy, but the conclusion that I’ve come to after all these weeks of being plagued by this is… something wants to eat me. 

*I’m being seasoned, basted, fattened up.* Whatever you want to call it. 

And I’ve been told by the former homeowner (the murderer, not the victim obviously), that I must: 

*“Confess to someone, anyone, or it’ll just get worse.”* 

He's a bit of a nutjob. He murdered someone, after all. But here I am, bringing this to the Reddit sleuths anyway, because the problem is: **I have no idea what I’m supposed to confess to.** 

Your conclusion is as good as mine. If anybody can help me out here, TYIA. 

Here goes: Two months ago, I bought a house. 

Colloquially, it was what people call a Murder House. The previous owner killed his fiance, allegedly. And as I mentioned, I've been in contact with him. 

People buy these types of houses all the time. I’m not that weird, and there’s usually nothing wrong with them. And my house sat on the market for months before I decided to buy it, which meant I got a good deal. 

But since I’m being honest, I might as well tell you that I bought it *specifically since* it was a murder house. More on that later, because the very day we moved in, I started noticing the forks. 

I was doing a little walking tour through the house on camera (again, not weird). 

The house is modest, a little tight but it was definitely a step up from where we were living. The backyard runs up against a local hiking trail, which was a plus for me. It had dark grey siding and a brand new roof to entice buyers. Inside were marble countertops, a spacious living room kinda like a split level. And all the carpet was taken out because of the amount of blood that seemed in.

You walk into an entryway with a kitchen to your right and a tiny set of stairs to your left. The kitchen was a huge draw. Lots of counter space, a big almost industrial stove set and a brand new fridge included, with a built in salad crisper. I was in heaven. I barely got to do any cooking in our little rinky dink apartment.

Those few stairs to the left of the entryway led to a living room landing which had another set of stairs that led up to the bedrooms. 

We also had a small unfinished basement, and I'm talking super small. Not like the ones you see on House Hunters where people have a budget of $10,000 and they somehow get a mansion.

But the piece de resistance was the top floor attic that would double as my office now that I was working from home. 

Anyway, with that layout in mind, I was walking around. 

*“Say ‘moving day!’”* 

I tried to get Kate to smile on camera, but she pushed it out of her face. 

My wife put up a stink about moving here, but eventually we did.  She didn’t understand such a big life change so suddenly. Frankly, I don’t think she’s like the new mustache I’m growing either, since I don’t have to shave for work now. But the move was good for us.

The walk through was normal, at least for me. I got up to the office and one of the boxes I stacked up slid from the top and slammed onto the ground. 

Kate yelled from downstairs, but I told her I was fine. 

You can hear it in the clip still, and my little gasp when the box clattered to the ground behind me.

So I bent over to clean up whatever had fallen, and it turned out it was kitchen supplies. Not just normal kitchen stuff, but an entire box of forks. Metal ones, plastic ones, salad forks, all just haphazardly thrown into this box. I didn't know we owned so many forks. 

*“Movers must've screwed up,”* I yelled downstairs and the event drifted from my mind.  

Later, I sent the walk through video to my family so they could see the layout. I got mostly dampened enthusiasm back. It was kind of hard for my parents and my sister to be excited about anything these days. 

My brother, the chef, passed away about three months ago. Part of that definitely prompted the move, which was why I appreciated Kate for being so understanding. Nate and I were super close. He was a few minutes younger than me, and I felt like he always looked to me to lead. So with his passing, I wanted him to still be proud of me. 

Anyway, my sister was the one who pointed the oddity out in the video. She FaceTimed me after I sent it.

*“Ew, what are you growing on your face?”* she said as I answered.

With a little pressing, she finally got to the point of the call. 

*“You have a demon door.”* 

I said something along the lines of: What the hell is that? 

*“In your office, that little door on the wall behind you in the video.”* 

Of course I saw what she was talking about. There was like a cubby door that led to the AC ducts. White, painted to match the wall, with just the faintest hint of a seam around it. A small frayed string stuck out from it as a way to pull it open.

I flipped the camera around and tried to show her. She didn't want to go anywhere near it, even over the phone. 

It was just a damn crawl space door. She called it a demon door from watching too many horror movies. But she ended the call.

I rolled my eyes and tugged at the string. Now, I gotta admit, that what happened got to me. I didn't tell her yet (cause I can't let her know she freaked me out). 

But when I pulled on the door string, it didn't budge. I thought it might've been sealed off or painted over. I ran downstairs to get a kitchen knife (from our actual kitchen stuff box) in the hopes of prying it open. I was pretty good with a knife and it seemed easy enough.

When I came back upstairs… it was open. 

I didn't think to look inside; I just ran and closed it. Obviously the door had just become unstuck from me pulling at it.

But before we went to bed that night, I screwed one of those latches onto the wall and the side of the door. Then I slammed closed a little padlock and spun the code. 

I hate admitting that what she said made me uneasy. I was the calm, rational one. I don’t believe in ghosts or the supernatural. I’m a former investigator with the Baltimore PD. Those things aren’t mutually exclusive (I know a bunch of the guys who believed in superstition); I just meant that I don’t. But I was more on edge and nervous since Nate’s passing. 

He took his own life. He’d been keeping his depression from our family for years, and I blame myself for not seeing the signs. During the next few weeks after coming back to work, I just felt like I couldn’t do my job. Then there was an incident at work.

There was a 911 call downtown and I responded. When I got on the scene, we were keeping an eye out for a drunk and disorderly as we scoured the neighborhood. 

I found the guy in an alley between two of the apartment buildings. He was bent over a pile of trash, just spewing vomit. The smell of trash and warm piss still wafts through my nostrils to this day and I swear it screwed up my sharply refined pallet when it came to tasting things.

I called it in on the walkie and assumed it'd be an easy arrest; the guy was done. But as I took a step closer, the recoiled backward. He had these eyes that I can't get out of my head. Just big orbs of black that took up the whole socket. He staggered toward me and hocked a huge wad of spit my direction. It hit me square in the forehead, wet and startling. I pulled my gun and demanded that he stop moving. He didn't. 

There I was, too afraid to pull the trigger. Here was another human life, just like my brother. I'd only ever shot someone once before, and I froze this time, thinking of Nate. The guy got close to my face. I could see the chunks of wet bar pretzels globbed to the side of his lips. He leaned in and whispered something to me, but I was too… I don't know. I never heard what he said. Then he just staggered past me. 

My fellow officers picked him up and I was sent for some psychological evaluations with our squad shrink. 

It didn't help. I couldn't get this man's scabbed face and warm breath out of my senses. 

Kate and I decided the life of a cop wasn’t for me any more. The world around me had changed since Nate, and I didn't feel like my old self.

So I retired early, set out for a new career to hopefully bring some light to cold cases in the community. My plan was to start a charity for the victims of unsolved cases, and do sort of like a true crime YouTube docu-series thing on each case.

Now that we were all moved in, it was time to start my new life and new hopeful career. 

I spent the next two days digging into the case of the people who lived here before me, getting old police reports, footage from interviews, court transcripts, all that. I was listening to the police interrogation tapes while building my new office desk, one of those crappy Ikea ones with the directions that didn’t seem to make any sense. Most of my research I did during the day while Kate was at work.

A little background info on what happened in this house will help explain what I found next. It's all pertinent, I swear.

Matt Hughes and his fiance, Clio Thompkins, moved into this same house in August of 2023. Matt owned a bakery a few blocks away which I'm told was pretty good. 

Clio was a med student, top of her class type of thing. And just like what you see in most true crime docs, she was a bright star extinguished too soon. 

Matt was to blame. His bakery went under. Meanwhile, Clio finished her first year at Hopkins and got promoted to chief resident. 

It drove Matt crazy, this toxic idea that he needed to be the successful one, the one in the limelight. At least that's how he describes it to the police. 

He and Clio were having problems, and so he came up with a plan to kill her. The long and short of it, on November 2023, Matt turns himself into the police saying that he killed Clio with a baking sheet – just beat her head in with it in the living room until she stopped breathing. 

I was working at the precinct then and that's how I first heard about it. Even though I wasn't on the case, it's all everyone was talking about, because…

When officers arrived at the house, there was blood all over the living room like Matt said. But there were two more very strange things: 

1. Clio's body was never found in the home or the woods behind the house. And…
2. When forensic techs tested the blood, **none of it belonged to Clio.**

In fact, the blood around the room apparently had six different strands of DNA in it. All things seemed to point to Matt being some kind of serial killer. 

“I only killed Clio.” Matt was adamant in the police interview. 

Even with dogs scouring the hiking trail, there weren’t even any traces of DNA, blood, anything from Clio or any of those other potential victims based on the blood.

And from what I found out during research, someone can’t be charged with murder with only a confession. So without a body, without any other victims linked to the blood, and without anything else for the case to go forward with, Matt Hughes was released from the county jail after ten days locked up. 

After I read all that, I was more confused than ever. This wasn’t a murder house at all, because (obviously) there was no real proof that anyone was killed here. 

I’d just invested all of our savings to move, I quit my job, and now this docu-series was leading nowhere. Kate and I were already a little strained from the move, and this definitely didn’t help. 

I’d cooked for us as a peace offering. Barbeque grilled salmon with scallion roasted potatoes and a pea puree that filled our new kitchen with the scent of garlic and butter in the air. Apparently it wasn’t enough to keep our moods lively that evening. 

*“I wanna hire a cadaver dog,”* I told her, mid-bite. 

*“Can we please talk about something else?”* 

Kate had a glass of red wine with dinner, and it bothered me every time she took a sip. You don’t drink red wine with fish. And apparently me not drinking with her annoyed her too. It was something we used to do together after work, but I haven’t had a drink since Nate died. 

*“The cops barely investigated the case, Kate.”* 

*“I thought you always had their backs. You’re gonna piss off your whole department.”*

*“Matt said he buried her body in the woods behind our house–”*

*S*he slammed down her fork, her lips upturned in disgust. I watched her scrape her plate off into the trash can next to our marble kitchen counter. All that hard work making dinner, and half of it went uneaten. She could’ve saved it as leftovers. 

*“Were you always this easily frustrated?”* I picked at my food. 

I didn’t mean to come across as such a jerk, but I’d never seen her like this. She just grunted in reply and went up to bed. I figured I’d be sleeping on the sofa that night, and I was right. 

It was hard for me to fall asleep that night. I guess I’d always idealized my relationship with Kate. It seemed so easy, she seemed so agreeable that I didn’t expect us to butt heads. I wanted to be a part of this perfect relationship; wanted it so badly that I’d do anything for it.

This night was particularly cold, just turning fall and Kate was the one who ran hot. So there I was, finally feeling like I could drift off to sleep, this scratchy wool blanket pulled up to my chin on our white couch, when I heard a shuffling noise from behind me. 

At first, I figured it was just my imagination, or maybe a mouse we didn’t know about looking for scraps in the kitchen. Then I heard it again– This light scuffle like rooting around in a drawer. 

I sat up, craned my head as far as I could toward the sound, and it just kept clattering, clattering, clattering in the next room. 

The laminate had a chill that burned my toes when I stepped off the sofa. The floor let out a long groan beneath my heels as I stepped down, and the shuffling from the kitchen stopped. I froze in place, whatever was in there had clearly heard me. 

*“Kate?”* I let out, hoping she’d snuck down past me when I had my eyes closed. Maybe she needed a midnight snack, too. 

There was no reply. And I took another step. Whatever was in there wasn’t going to scare me. 

Then a noise came back. It was a groan, almost like a croak of someone with a sore throat that came back to me, saying the same thing I just had.

*“...Kate?”* 

I rushed around the corner to see and– ***CRASH***. A kitchen drawer come smashing to the ground, sending silverware clanging in every direction. 

Kate called my name from upstairs. I told her to call 911 as I grabbed an umbrella from the entryway closet as a weapon. 

The front door was locked – I turned the knob as I passed to make sure. So whoever was in my house had come from either our back door, or the basement. 

I crept forward into the kitchen, tiptoeing around forks and knives smattering the floor. But there was nothing in the kitchen. Our back door was closed and locked from inside. 

The police also found nothing when they arrived. They scoured the house, checked every closet, nook and cranny. There was no one here. 

*“Maybe it was just a critter?”* one suggested. 

As if a racoon or a mouse could talk. Regardless, I thanked them for checking and made a mental note to get an alarm system. 

One of the officers, a hefty guy with a bald head, turned back to me on his way out. 

*“How you holding up, J?”* he clasped his arm on my back. 

I had to stifle a recoil in my neck. I didn’t even realize I knew this guy. 

*“It’s been a hell of a few months,”* I said, and that seemed to placate him. 

He nodded and told me the boys missed me. That we should all grab a beer soon. I said sure with no inclination to actually do that. 

The one good thing about that night was that Kate wanted me back in bed with her after, just so she could sleep. She had work early in the morning and didn’t think she’d even be able to close her eyes again without me sleeping on the side of the bed closer to the bedroom door. So I passed out and woke up way later in the afternoon when she’d already left for work. 

Something crunchy in the sheet woke me up and I jolted as my hand touched something next to me. I whipped the blanket off the bed and slid myself out without a second to think. 

When I checked back, I saw them: Dozens of leaves all around me in bed. Not just any leaves, either, not like typical forest leaves. These were sprigs, herbal, fresh smelling and something I recognized from years of being in the kitchen. They were heads of thyme leaves, scattered all around our bed. This was the first incident of food-related objects in my bed. 

I didn’t tell Kate at the time, mostly because I didn’t know what the hell to make of it. 

While she was at work that day, I ran to Home Depot and got an easy-install home monitoring system. I put one of those sliding locks on the basement door so that it could only be unlocked from upstairs, and I sure as heck checked the padlock on the demon door – Still secure. 

It wasn’t for another week or so that anything else strange happened in the house. 

Since my conversation with Kate, I’d been going for a “hike” in the woods nearby almost every afternoon she was out. I say hike in quotation marks because what I was really doing was scouring every inch of the trail for any sign of Clio. 

I know it was ridiculous – This was a decently-populated path, and the part that backed up to my backyard had been combed by officers before. I didn’t know what I was hoping I’d find, but I certainly didn’t expect what I’d stumbled over. 

It was a brisk day, maybe around 11 in the morning, and the sun was still hiding behind grey clouds. The air that day smelled like a campfire, the cozy warmth of a nostalgic fall approaching as the heat of summer crisped up leaves and turned them orange. I threw on a jacket and a pair of boots, made sure to lock up behind me, and headed out. 

According to Matt Hughes’ testimony, he dragged Clio down from the living room stairs and into the kitchen. Shortly after, he pulled her through the basement door and into the back yard. She was already reaching early stages of rigor mortis by this point, which made moving her even more difficult. 

Her long arms were tight at the joints and he fumbled to get her through the door. He had planned to kill her one day, but that was about as far as he had ironed out. Getting her somewhere she couldn’t be found was the hard part he didn’t expect. 

He told the officers that he clumsily dragged her through the yard and into the brush behind the house. It took him hours to dig a hole that was barely deep enough to cover Clio entirely. So he kept her covered with a tarp and would dig a deeper hole further into the woods another day. 

*“The guilt, man, it got to me so bad,”* Matt said in one interview. *“I just kept moving her further and further away from the house every few days.”* 

And eventually, he was unable to identify exactly where he’d left her body the final time before turning himself in to the police. 

So, on my walks, I used whatever composite of information I could to mark out areas on a crudely-drawn map for where Clio’s body might have been. 

On my seventh walk (I can tell because of how many places I marked off before), **I found her.** 

But not in the form I was expecting. 

Stepping over the jutting twigs that covered the brush off the beaten path, I scoured the ground, imagining that each potential sharp snap of a branch under my boot could’ve been a degraded bone from Clio’s body. So I took my time once I stepped off the trail and into the leaves.

For weeks after her disappearance, family and friends of Clio came to do the same. I didn’t think I could do better than them; I wasn’t that vain. They were missing a bright young girl whom they loved. I was just hoping to do her some justice. 

But as I trudged past a fallen tree, something big and barely held up by the branches of other trees around it, I heard a voice. It was small, maybe someone whispering or mumbling. I stopped in my tracks and listened, hoping a chatting couple on the trail behind me would pass by, but they didn’t. 

I turned to the direction of the sound. There was a crumpling of leaves that I didn’t cause. Then (maybe twenty feet from me), something shot up from the ground suddenly. It looked like the end of a zombie movie where the hand rises from the ground, implying a sequel. But this one wasn’t green and decaying – It was brown, skinny and long, with fingers that looked limp more than threatening. 

*“Help,”* came the whisper again. 

I sprinted over, realizing there was someone collapsed into the leaves. I’d somehow walked nearby them during my search and didn’t even notice. 

I knelt down and scrambled to brush off the dirt and leaves covering the person, and then I was struck by what I saw. It was a face I recognized now, after seeing dozens of pictures of her. On the ground, not in a grave, not a pile of decaying flesh and bones, but rather a woman just lying in the dirt like she’d fainted, was Clio Thompkins, alive. 

Her skin was rough, her hands calloused as I pulled her off the ground. She looked dehydrated and sickly but otherwise unharmed, and my natural instinct was to call 911. 

I had no signal this far into the woods, so I helped her up and we staggered back to my house. She went in without an issue, and there I was able to call. 

My mind was racing as I sat across from her at the kitchen table before an ambulance arrived. I don’t know what to make of it. Clio was here, alive, no longer missing after almost two full years. There was no way she was living in the woods this whole time. She had to be somewhere, potentially against her will if she wasn’t able to come home. 

It took me minutes to even realize I should give her water or food or whatever she needed. I turned on my stove to boil water for coffee (I have a French Press that I like more than a traditional coffee maker). But as I reached for it, I realized all of the burners on the stove were already on, lit to Low heat. It was an electric stove, so not the biggest deal hazard-wise, but I wondered how long they’d been on. 

Clio didn’t talk or take the coffee when offered. She just stared off into the distance (which was of course understandable with whatever she was going through here). Her eyes were dark, sunken in next to her protruding cheekbones. She was skinnier than I’d seen her from the phones, her hair matted down with leaves and dirt.

The next hour was a blur as medical professionals arrived and took Clio off, only to be replaced by police officers asking me dozens of questions that I didn’t have answers to. 

*“I don’t know,”* I’d say. *“I just found her.”* 

That wasn’t enough for them apparently. 

*“I know you wouldn’t be involved in any type of missing person shit, but man, this is some freaky coincidence.”* 

That much was for damn sure. This was the same bald officer who I’d apparently been friends with before. Now he was looking out for me again, but I didn’t have any more information than what I told him. 

Kate was more flabbergasted than I was when I told her. By then, the police had all left and things were apparently wrapped up. Of course, I went to record a little vlog of my reactions to everything, just for posterity when I eventually made the docu-series. 

To say Kate didn’t believe me was an understatement. 

*“I think you should talk to someone,”* she said. *“You haven’t been yourself since…”* 

I knew what she was going to say: Since Nate died. And maybe she was right, but that didn’t mean I needed professional help. I’d just uncovered a major true crime twist and all she could do was tell me to talk to a shrink. 

Things got heated. She went to stay with her parents for the night. 

It was late when all was said and done, and I was exhausted. I didn’t even get a shower after how long a day it was, and I just decided to crawl in bed. 

I scrolled through pictures of me and Nate on my phone. He was always the skinny one. He never ate as much as me, and apparently I was taking all the nutrients even in the womb. Nate was smart, but he didn’t apply himself. He wanted to be a chef, went to culinary school and ended up screwing up his life with debt and drugs. I missed my brother, despite everything. I wished I’d done more for him. I wished I didn’t make decisions I couldn’t come back from.

The last picture I had of us was Thanksgiving the year before. He was scraggly there, with this hilarious mustache that curled like he was an old-timey villain. He cooked dinner for everybody and it was a good time. It was nice to remember him that way. I figured I probably looked a little like him now, losing some weight from eating less, and trying to grow out the same mustache. I twirled it as I scrolled. 

At some point, I must’ve fallen asleep because I awoke to a banging noise like a ***THUD THUD THUD*** on wood. Then a pause. Then it started again. 

At first, I thought it was Kate knocking on the door. Maybe she changed her mind or lost her key and needed school clothes. But when I crawled from bed in a dazed state, I checked my phone and realized it was four in the morning. And the banging wasn’t coming from downstairs, it was coming from overhead. 

With my handy defense umbrella downstairs, I picked up my dresser lamp and upturned it so that the heavy metal base could act as a weapon if I needed it to. Out in the hall was when I finally understood where the banging was coming from: My office. 

I turned on all the lights in the hall when I saw it: These puffy, red splotches all over my right forearm. I dismissed it, thinking it could just be poison ivy. There was something more pressing to worry about. 

With as little sound as I could make, I crept up the narrow set of stairs leading to my attic office. Upstairs, the light was off. The only switch for that room was inside the attic itself. 

I ascended with the upside down lamp first, leading the way. The ***THUD THUD THUD*** grew louder, less rhythmic now and more constant. I thought my ears would start bleeding if I took a single step closer, but then I was on the landing. 

I flicked on the light and *yelled*, hoping to hype myself up for an attack or surprise whatever was up there, but…

It was just my office. Everything was where it should have been. No one was up there and there was no place to hide. The desk had no back, just resting on metal legs so I could clearly see if anyone or anything was under there; there wasn’t. 

But then I noticed: The padlock on the ~~crawl space~~ demon door was unlatched. 

Out from the door stuck a wooden spoon. 

A clog of bile filled my throat and I could feel my heartbeat in my cheeks. I could hear my heartbeat, too, which I realized meant… The banging stopped. 

I should’ve run, should’ve just called the police again. Would they even have come this time, or would I get a snarky response about my mental health or it being another “critter” again? 

I’d seen enough horror movies as a kid to know two things: 

1. I should not go check that door. 
2. If I did check that door, I would sure as shit find some spooky stuff that would explain what paranormal phenomenon was haunting me. (Probably notebooks and stacks of papers on the history of monsters who want to cook you, most likely in Latin.) 

And I didn’t speak Latin anyway. 

But I was also kind of an idiot. So I checked the door. 

Crouching down in front of it, I pulled the string. The hinge squeaked open with a yip that made me jump in the now overwhelming silence. My office room light should’ve cast some shadow over the door, at least letting me see inside, but I couldn’t. It was eerily pitch black, a void practically calling me forward. There was a smell emanating out, something warm and putrid like stagnant swamp water on a summer day. 

I felt the wall on one side, then the other for a light switch and was met with only rough, unfinished plywood on either side. I swiped around for a pulley chain overhead, practically flailing in the unnatural darkness until I felt something cold in my hand. I yanked. 

An overhead light came on and I lifted the lamp in reaction, ready to swipe with what little space I had. But there was no monster, no stacks of papers, and certainly nothing in Latin. 

Instead, I found a small blow-up mattress, now deflated, with a blanket covered in dust. There was an extension cord running down a floorboard and a phone charger attached at the end. In the corner was a bucket with a plastic bag in it. It was a makeshift toilet – I realized as soon as I saw it, because the sickening smell finally lined up with a visual. Inside was old pee, dark orange now. 

From that and the amount of dust on the blanket, my fears were somewhat lessened. Yes, it looked like somebody had been living or at least sleeping in here… But it wasn’t recent. 

If whoever was in my house a few weeks ago, whoever was knocking now, was living in this attic, there’d be less dust and probably fresher pee. 

But that didn’t explain what in the hell was knocking and opening my door now. 

I turned on every light in the house again, checked every lock twice. No alarm had gone off either, so there wasn’t anything open from the outside. 

With a huff, I collapsed in a chair at the kitchen table and decided to have some of the coffee I made yesterday. There was no way I was going back to sleep now. 

My arm was itching, too. That big red patch that seemed like poison ivy. In the light, and now that I took my time, I could tell it wasn’t one big splotch – It was a bunch of tiny bumps, hives pocking out against my skin. It was some kind of allergic reaction, but not to a plant. I was only allergic to one thing, both me and Nate were: Sesame oil. 

Sesame oil was in a lot of stuff, particularly Mediterranean or Asian food. I couldn’t have hummus, which is just as much of a bummer as you’d imagine, because it seemed delicious. 

At first, I thought maybe Clio had some on her hand or clothes and maybe it wiped onto me. But as I looked in the mirror, I saw the rash was on my neck and parts of my lower back.

I ran to my bedroom and whipped back the sheet. My blanket was soaked, not in sweat – I held it up to my nose and breathed in. It was nutty, earthy. It was sesame oil. 

This was the second food-prep related incident in my bed. 

I stayed up trying to piece things together, in the middle of my kitchen with every light on and every door locked. What in the hell was going on? Was there someone living in my house? And what did all the food have to do with it? 

It dawned on me as odd that Clio had come into the house so freely. With all that happened with her fiance, (you know, being attacked by him), you’d think she’d be wary of the house. But she came in easily and didn’t seem the least bit bothered. 

If Matt Hughes didn’t kill Clio, why confess to it? And where was he now? 

That was a week ago. 

Kate had eventually come back home and I promised to ease up on my new obsession, but in reality, I was even more determined to figure out what was going on. 

By this point, I was staying awake most nights, too afraid of what would happen if I fell asleep. I just lied next to Kate, watching something on my phone or listening to music until her alarm went off. Then I’d pretend to be asleep, close my eyes when she got up, and sleep during the day while she was at work. 

I called to check on Clio multiple times over that week when I could. She was still in the hospital, and although I couldn’t speak directly to her, the nurses assured me that she was recovering. 

“Yes, she knows you’re the one who found her,” one nurse said when I asked. I figured she’d want to talk to me if she knew who was calling. 

Fellow officers showed up at my house again yesterday, waking me from my day-sleep to ask me some additional questions. 

“I don’t have to answer unless you charge me with something, right?” I said, my paranoia maybe getting the best of me. 

“You know that’s correct, John,” the officer replied. I went to shut the door. 

I paused, pulled the front door back open a bit. “Say, question for you. If I wanted to contact Matthew Hughes, the previous owner, how would I… go about…” 

I trailed off, and the bald officer looked at me like I had three heads. 

“Standard procedure?” he said, his voice going up like it was a question. “He’s in BCDC.”

I smiled, of course I knew standard procedure. Then shut the door for real. 

And this had me questioning even more. Why was Matt Hughes in prison, if he was never charged with the murder of Clio to begin with? 

Last night, I needed some sleep. Not only because my cop friend woke me up before I hit REM, but also because I made some big plans for today. I got in contact with Matt’s attorney. I had a meeting with him this afternoon. 

So against my better judgement, I locked my door last night and decided to really go to bed shortly after Kate did. I set up my phone first on a little stand by my dresser.

“It’s so I can watch without holding it,” I laughed to Kate. 

“Nerd,” she said. 

We were on better terms now. Probably so long as she didn’t know what was going on. 

Before long, she was asleep and snoring next to me (like she did every night, even though she denied it). I positioned the phone next to me and turned on the camera so it would record my face and body while I slept. It could see most of the bed with it zoomed out to the max; something about fish eye lenses or whatever these modern phones had. 

I got some sleep. I felt rested. 

I heard Kate get up, unlock the door to the bedroom and get ready for school. So nothing had snuck into the room; obviously it was still locked. Good. 

Twenty minutes later, Kate came back to kiss me before she left. She leaned down, her wet hair tickling my face a little to wake me up. She kissed my cheek and pulled back. 

*“Whoa, is that pepper?”* 

Over coffee, when the realization hit me (that someone was still in my room last night), I decided to check my phone gallery. The screen blinked back up at me as I stared at it, dumbfounded. 

The recording was only an hour and thirty-two minutes long. It shouldn’t have shut off; I made sure I had plenty of space for it to record and there was no cap to the duration as long as the phone didn’t die or fill up. 

I clicked it and scrolled over as far as I could to end without doing that annoying thing where it jumps to the final section like you’re marking it as watched. 

The image of me lying in bed popped up in the little picture-in-picture. I didn’t see anything at all as I zoomed through the timeline. 

Then, I slowed down and let it roll for the last twenty seconds. 

Nothing. Nothing. Snoring. Still nothing. 

Then a finger, pasty white and skinny lifted into the frame view, right next to my head. 

It hovered, then fumbled around on the phone screen, covering the camera. The video ended. 

Whatever was in my room last night had stopped the recording. 

I threw up in the kitchen sink, sweating and feeling my heartbeat in my ears. 

As quickly as I could, I grabbed my clothes, my stack of research papers on the case and got the hell out of the house. I dressed in my car and drove to the Baltimore City Detention Center (BCDC). 

I could go through the whole process with you. There was a lot of red tape to jump through, trust me. I could tell you everything that Matt Hughes said to me through thick glass as he sat in his orange jumpsuit with vacant eyes. But that wouldn’t help you, and it certainly wouldn’t help me.

So we’ll cut to the chase for now.  

*“You killed someone, too,”* he said with a grin that was missing a few teeth. His lips were dry, cracking as he spoke. 

*“What are you talking about? You didn’t kill Clio Thompkins. She’s alive.”*

*“That’s not Clio,”* he said. 

He shook his head, a scraggly mess of brown hair grown too long from the years in here. 

*“I killed Clio months before that thing showed up,”* he continued. *“And if it found you–”*

*“I found her,”* I corrected him. 

*“...If it found you, it means it knows. And unless you confess, it’ll just get worse.”* 

What was it? And had this happened to Matt? I still had so many questions, but he wouldn’t answer them. He wasn’t here to be my mentor; he didn’t care. And frankly, I didn’t know if I believed anything he had to say. 

Something or someone was messing with me, trying to scare the shit out of me. It felt like a police sting I’d seen on TV; making the person paranoid so that they’ll tell you whatever information you want. 

*“Your only other hope is going someplace it can’t get to you,”* he said, then hung up the phone. 

So I was back in my car, wondering about this supposed confession that I had to make thanks to crazy Matt’s ramblings. In the meantime, I planned my next course of action as I drove to get a decent meal somewhere. No disgusting fast food, maybe like a smoothie bowl or something. Maybe Mexican if there was a decent place around us. Just somewhere I could sit and have a good meal without going home. 

On the drive, I called the hospital. 

“Hi, I’m calling again to talk to Clio Thompkins.” 

The nurse on the other end was the same one who I’d talked to most times now. I’m sure she’d recognize the request and just give me the usual update. But that didn’t come. 

*“Sir, she’s no longer here.”* 

I asked her to explain, or maybe I stammered, “*Uhh, what?”* 

*“She left two days ago against medical advisement. We haven’t seen her since.”* 

And the phone call ended. 

Again, I don’t believe in the paranormal or the supernatural. But things around my house have been getting worse. 

I should move, stay somewhere else temporarily, or at least stay awake all night. But I need to know who is prepping me for some kind of fucked up feast, or at least try to figure out what kind of confession I need to make to someone, anyone, to get this thing to leave me alone. 

Tonight, I’m going to sleep. I set up a second camera looking down at my bed. 

More to come. ",1,1747412385.0,writers,1,1.0,False
