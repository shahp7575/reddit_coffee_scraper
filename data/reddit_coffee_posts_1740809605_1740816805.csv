This is an annual event with thousands of people taking part. Obviously this involves some road closures and traffic control. Abusing the marshalls volunteering their time to help manage the race or the traffic officers closing the roads does not help anyone. 

Finally, I'd like to respond to some of the comments received. 

To the gym bro threateningly saying to the marshal ""You are not as strong as you think"" after finding out he had to wait for the road to gym to be opened:   I'm sorry you can't read or that your gym didn't inform you of this. But please learn some manners. 

To the tannie who wanted to be let through because ""my -insert relation here- runs nationals"": My dad's cousin's step-daughter's teacher is the great-uncle of the person who designed that road. So that means I out rank you. 

To the taxi driver shouting at participants to run because ""I'm wasting diesel here for you"": You know you can turn the engine off, right? 

To the other gym person: Although nicer than a threat, the marshalls cannot let you through in exchange for a coffee. ",5,1740816168.0,capetown,0,0.86,False
1j0uk1i,https://i.redd.it/k91hxia0c1me1.png,Thought I Didn't Like Lavazza Coffee Beans… But Now I'm Changing My Mind,"Link to my earlier post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/s/xERtKzghaV

So, I ordered some Lavazza coffee beans a little over a week ago, and after my first few cups, I was pretty disappointed. The flavor just didn’t hit right for me—felt a bit flat and not as rich as I expected. Initially, I gave them a 5/10 and was already thinking about switching back to my usual brand.

But I stuck with it, and after about five more days of brewing with different grind sizes and tweaking my ratios, I have to admit… it's growing on me. The flavors are opening up, and I’m starting to appreciate the smoothness and balance a lot more. It’s still not my all-time favorite, but I’d definitely bump my rating up to a 7/10 now.

Anyone else had a similar experience where a coffee they didn’t like at first ended up winning them over?

1j0ui6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j0ui6q/one_rule_dont_go_into_the_basement/,One Rule: Don’t Go Into the Basement.,"It was supposed to be the perfect weekend getaway. Five friends, a secluded cabin in the woods, and no cell service for miles. Just us, nature, and a cooler full of beer. We’d been planning this trip for months, ever since Jake found the listing online. “Black Hollow Cabin,” he’d said, grinning like a kid on Christmas. “Totally off the grid. No tourists, no noise, no nothing. Just us.”

The drive was long, the kind of long where the trees start to look like they’re closing in on you. The GPS had stopped working about an hour ago, and we were relying on Jake’s printed directions. The road narrowed, the pavement giving way to gravel, then dirt. The sun was setting by the time we pulled up to the cabin, its orange glow casting long shadows through the trees.

The cabin itself was... unsettling. It wasn’t the rustic, charming kind of cabin you see in movies. It was old, the wood warped and dark, like it had been soaked in something. The windows were small and clouded, and the front door hung slightly crooked on its hinges. There was a smell too, faint but persistent, like wet earth and something metallic.

“Charming,” Sarah said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. She was always the skeptic, the one who rolled her eyes at ghost stories and horror movies. But even she looked uneasy as we unloaded the car.

Inside, the cabin was dim and cold. The furniture was sparse—a sagging couch, a rickety table, and a few mismatched chairs. The fireplace was filled with ashes, and the air smelled like mildew. We found the bedrooms upstairs, two of them, each with a pair of creaky twin beds. Jake and I took one room, Sarah, Emily, and Mark took the other.

That first night, we tried to make the best of it. We lit a fire, cracked open some beers, and told stories. But there was something off, something none of us could quite put into words. The firelight flickered in a way that made the shadows dance too much, like they were alive. And the woods outside were too quiet, like they were holding their breath.

I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of scratching. It was faint, but persistent, like something was trying to get in. I lay there, my heart pounding, listening. The sound was coming from the window. I told myself it was just a tree branch, but when I looked, there was nothing there. Just the black void of the forest.

The next morning, we found the first note.

It was tucked under the coffee pot, written on a yellowed piece of paper in shaky handwriting. \*“Don’t go into the basement.”\*

We all laughed it off, of course. “Probably left by the last renters,” Mark said, crumpling the note and tossing it into the fire. But I noticed he didn’t suggest we check the basement.

The day passed uneventfully. We hiked, we drank, we played cards. But as the sun dipped below the trees, the mood shifted. The scratching came back, louder this time, and it wasn’t just at my window. It was everywhere—the walls, the floor, the ceiling. Like the cabin itself was alive.

Then Emily screamed.

We found her in the bathroom, staring at the mirror. Her reflection was wrong. It was her, but... not her. The eyes were too wide, the smile too sharp. And it was moving, just slightly out of sync with her. She slammed her hand against the glass, and the reflection did the same, but slower, like it was lagging.

We all saw it. None of us could explain it.

That night, we decided to leave. We packed up our stuff and headed for the car, but the keys were gone. All of them. Even the spare Jake kept in his backpack. And the car... the car wouldn’t start. The engine didn’t even turn over.

That’s when we heard the voice.

It came from the basement, faint but clear. A child’s voice, singing a nursery rhyme. \*“Ring around the rosie, pocket full of posies...”\*

We stood there, frozen, as the singing grew louder. And then the door to the basement creaked open on its own.

I don’t know who moved first, but we all ran. Out the door, into the woods, not caring about the dark or the cold or the branches clawing at our faces. We ran until we couldn’t run anymore, until we were lost and the cabin was nowhere in sight.

We found a road eventually, and a passing truck driver gave us a ride to the nearest town. The police went back to the cabin, but they didn’t find anything. No notes, no scratches, no singing. Just an empty, rotting cabin in the middle of the woods.

We never talked about what happened. Not really. But sometimes, late at night, I hear the scratching. And I know it’s not coming from outside. It’s coming from inside me.

And the worst part? I think it’s always been there.",1,1740815903.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1j0ue12,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1j0ue12/the_economic_blackout_on_228_is_absolutely_stupid/,The “Economic Blackout” on 2/28 is absolutely stupid.,"I saw several posts throughout the week about the economic blackout that happened on February 28th. A lot of the posts were saying how you should stock up before the day, so you have extra of things you need and that you should support small businesses if you do need to buy something that day of the blackout. And to buy things with cash. 

The logic of the boycott is absolutely stupid. And here’s why:

First, if you stock up before the day, you’re just giving those companies more money upfront to have items in stock that you would have bought on the day of the blackout. So you just negated the whole purpose of your supposed “activism”. 

Second, I’m all for supporting small businesses, I know several small business owners, but even small businesses buy things from the large companies. How many small businesses buy supplies from Amazon, drink Folgers, Starbucks (insert coffee brand) coffee, use garbage bags, buy reams of paper to print use a computer, etc. so even while you are buying things from small businesses you’re not really doing an economic blackout out because you are indirectly supporting bigger businesses through the needs of the small business owner. So that small business owner is still using your money to support the larger businesses. 

If you really want to have an “economic blackout” you’d be growing your own food from seeds you found/picked yourself from the wild; you’d be making your own clothes (from cotton you grew yourself), build your own house with trees you cut down with tools and materials you mined for and made yourself; you’d be sourcing your own water without the conveniences of modern plumbing, and everything else you’d have to do from things that you made yourself. You wouldn’t be able to relax and watch Netflix, so you might want to read a book then right, nope, you can’t do that either. That is the only way you would have a successful “economic blackout” and you posting about it on social media from your smartphone to “rally the troops” so to speak, so you can get the word out and make it as effective as possible? Forget about it!

One day of not buying anything isn’t going to do any damage whatsoever, and yes I know the posts were saying that they’ll “do it for longer if it doesn’t work” but again that’s not going to be effective either. People that participate will give in by the second day and go back to buying things and everything else that they were doing before the protest. 

So to those of you who participated in the economic blackout, congrats on accomplishing absolutely nothing!",2,1740815410.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,0,0.75,False

## SCENE 1 - WHITE HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

*CHEF VICTOR BAXTER is busy preparing an elaborate meal. He hums happily to himself as he works.*

**NEWSCASTER (V.O.)**  
And as President Trump begins his second term, changes are expected throughout the White House staff...

*VICTOR turns up the volume on a small TV in the corner of the kitchen.*

**VICTOR**  
(to himself)  
Six years in this kitchen, through two administrations... I'm practically part of the furniture now!

*The kitchen door swings open. CORY enters, texting on his phone.*

**CORY**  
Dad, did you hear? Meena said they're bringing in some tech billionaire as a special advisor for White House operations.

**VICTOR**  
(waving dismissively)  
Presidents come and go, but everybody's gotta eat! Nothing changes in my kitchen.

*A well-dressed MAN with distinctive features enters the kitchen, followed by two ASSISTANTS carrying tablets.*

**MAN**  
Actually, I believe significant change is precisely what this administration promised.

**VICTOR**  
(startled)  
Excuse me, sir, this is a restricted area—

**MAN**  
Elon Tusk, special advisor to the President on operational efficiency.

*CORY's eyes widen in recognition.*

**CORY**  
(whispering)  
Dad! That's the Doge guy!

**ELON**  
(scrolling through a tablet)  
I've been reviewing the White House expenditures. The catering budget is... excessive.

**VICTOR**  
Sir, I've been the head chef here for—

**ELON**  
Six years, four months, and twelve days. During which food costs have increased 42% while nutritional efficiency has decreased 17%.

**VICTOR**  
Nutritional efficiency? I'm cooking for the President of the United States!

**ELON**  
Who has requested a more streamlined operation.

*ELON hands VICTOR a folder.*

**ELON**  
We're outsourcing food services to TuskEats. Your position has been eliminated.

*VICTOR stares in shock at the termination papers.*

**CORY**  
You can't fire my dad! He's the best chef the White House has ever had!

**ELON**  
(checking his watch)  
The transition team will be here in twenty minutes. Please clear out your personal items.

*ELON exits, assistants in tow.*

**VICTOR**  
(stunned)  
Six years... just like that.

**CORY**  
(angry)  
This is crazy! The President can't let this happen!

**VICTOR**  
(sighing)  
New administration, new rules, son.

## SCENE 2 - BAXTER APARTMENT - EVENING

*VICTOR sits at the kitchen table, scrolling through job listings on his laptop. CORY enters, clearly agitated.*

**CORY**  
I can't believe this! We're part of White House history! Doesn't that count for anything?

**VICTOR**  
(resigned)  
The world's changing, Cory. Even the White House has to ""innovate"" now.

**CORY**  
(determined)  
Well, I'm not accepting this. I'm gonna talk to Meena. Her dad still has connections.

**VICTOR**  
Cory, don't get involved. I'll find another job.

**CORY**  
At another White House? Dad, this was your dream!

*CORY's phone buzzes. He checks it.*

**CORY**  
Great. Sophie says they've replaced the kitchen staff with robots. Actual robots!

**VICTOR**  
(chuckling sadly)  
Well, they better be waterproof. That kitchen floods every spring.

*CORY sits beside his father, putting a hand on his shoulder.*

**CORY**  
Remember when you told me the White House belongs to the people? That we were there to serve something bigger than ourselves?

**VICTOR**  
(nodding)  
I meant it.

**CORY**  
Then we fight this. Together.

## SCENE 3 - WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR - NEXT DAY

*CORY and MEENA huddle near a service entrance, whispering.*

**MEENA**  
The robots are a disaster! One of them caught fire trying to make toast.

**CORY**  
So they'll bring my dad back?

**MEENA**  
Not if Tusk has his way. But I heard the President complained about his breakfast this morning.

**CORY**  
(excitedly)  
That's our opening! We need to remind everyone what they're missing.

*SOPHIE rushes up to them.*

**SOPHIE**  
Guys! Emergency in the East Wing! The robot waiters spilled coffee all over the Japanese delegation!

**CORY**  
(grinning)  
Perfect timing.

## SCENE 4 - WHITE HOUSE KITCHEN - LATER

*The kitchen is in chaos. Smoke rises from a malfunctioning robot. ELON argues with TECHNICIANS.*

**ELON**  
It's a simple code error! Just reboot the system!

*CORY slips in through a side door, carrying a container. He quickly plates its contents onto official White House china.*

*The PRESIDENT enters, followed by AIDES.*

**PRESIDENT**  
What in tarnation is happening to my White House?

**ELON**  
Just minor technical issues, Mr. President. Innovation requires—

*CORY steps forward with the plate.*

**CORY**  
Mr. President? My dad thought you might be missing his famous chili.

*The PRESIDENT eyes the food, then takes a bite. His expression changes to delight.*

**PRESIDENT**  
Now that's what I'm talking about! Where's Chef Baxter?

**CORY**  
He was let go yesterday, sir. Operational efficiency.

*The PRESIDENT turns to ELON.*

**PRESIDENT**  
Efficiency? I've been served burnt eggs and robot coffee all day! Get Baxter back here immediately!

**ELON**  
But sir, the cost savings—

**PRESIDENT**  
Some things are worth paying for, Tusk. Food is one of them.

## SCENE 5 - BAXTER APARTMENT - EVENING

*VICTOR and CORY sit on the couch watching the news.*

**NEWSCASTER**  
In White House news, after a brief experiment with automated food services, President Trump has reinstated the traditional kitchen staff, citing ""the importance of the human touch in American institutions.""

*VICTOR's phone rings. He answers.*

**VICTOR**  
Yes, Mr. President... Thank you, sir... I'm honored to return... Yes, I'll bring that chili recipe.

*He hangs up, smiling at CORY.*

**VICTOR**  
Looks like we're going back.

**CORY**  
(grinning)  
See? Some things even a billionaire can't change.

**VICTOR**  
(thoughtfully)  
You know, son, every administration brings its challenges. But at the end of the day, people are still people. They need connection, tradition... good food.

**CORY**  
(nodding)  
And when someone tries to take that away...

**VICTOR & CORY**  
(together)  
You're in the house now!

*They laugh and high-five as we FADE OUT.*

1j0u5g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1j0u5g6/oversharing_and_lying/,Oversharing and lying,"I over share massively. I meet people for the first time and explain how neglectful my childhood was or talk about my past abusive relationships. I’ve done this my whole life and never realised how it’s likely a symptom of ADHD.  

I’ve only recently (last 6 months since leaving my abusive partner) realised that I do this and how wrong some others seem to find it. My closest friends are used to it I suppose because no one’s ever said “hey you over share” although people do say I talk too much and am too loud. 

The problem is, sometimes I lie as well. Like a few weeks ago I was off work with mental health problems and instead of telling my family I was going out in the morning and just sitting in a coffee shop all day. 

I always think of myself as an honest person (maybe too honest) and very trusting (maybe too trusting). I assume that people will keep private things private. But I don’t even follow that rule and don’t keep things private. I’m so confused by how I think. I’m so so inconsistent. 

This week I shared a personal problem at work about a friend with a colleague who I trusted. I did over share. I explained something private a friend had said to me. The colleague took my problem and twisted it and told everyone including my manager, and has made me out to be a bad friend and said I’m breaching confidentiality. 

I’ve now lied to try and fix it and said “that’s only partially true but I didn’t say …”. The problem is ever since I’ve told this lie I’ve felt sick with guilt and confusion and anxiety. But if I back track I will lose my friend as it does implicate them. My manager doesn’t care but I cannot trust my colleagues anymore and feel sick to my core that I’ve been betrayed. 

I’m now reflecting and realising I lie almost every day. Mostly to hide certain feelings or to save face or spare difficult conversations. I guess I’ve learnt to over the years because I’ve realised I can normally make others like me more by lying or improve a situation by lying. And there’s no consequence. I remember as a child practising a lie with family and being stunned that no one questioned it. I’ve always lied about the most mundane things. I also know I lie about who I’m seeing with family to avoid judgement. I’ve not got a supportive family.

However this time I don’t know if I’ve gone one step too far? I’ve hurt people at work. I’ve made a situation explode by saying I didn’t say half of what my colleague has said. I was mostly trying to protect my self and reputation as a good friend, but also protecting my friend as I didn’t want them in trouble. And now a second colleague has come forward to try and tarnish my name saying I said something else breaching confidentiality, and reiterated a separate conversation about my friend, so it does look suspicious. The problem is I do talk about my friend a lot because they’re the only friend I have at work. I didn’t mean any harm sharing something we’ve said together but it’s been taken really badly.

I’m standing by my lie but WTH is wrong with me?? How do I stop lying? Or is it ok to lie to serve me sometimes and to help others? I’m sick to my stomach about going back to work and dealing with this again for another week. 

I’ve decided I’m no longer communicating with any colleagues to protect myself. I will make it work I’m sure.

Spoiler alert, I loved almost all of them and there were no scrubbers. I feel they use very high quality materials. 

Sorce’s catalogue is, primarily, extremely pretty, fun, sweet and wearable. It very much does have a unifying undertone in most scents, generally cookie-like, but their florals also tend to have a sugared base scent too. 

I am not generally a huge florals fan but somehow they make even the whoppers like jasmine work for me- it’s a BIG surprise how many of their florals work for me. 

Relevant info: I do love gourmand adjacents (but rarely *purely* gourmands), and adore citrus. Meh on fruits. I do like some darker/odder stuff as well, a la BPAL Snake Oil or Olympic Orchid’s Night Flyer. Generally dislike large white florals, masc aquatics, heavy leather. 

**Villanelle’s Happy Ending**- the pink pepper comes through loud and clear! Ditto with the cashmeran, sandalwood and cedar. The strawberry milk, not so noticeable for me. Overall effect is peppery up top, with cool and silky wood underneath. It’s quite nice but not my favorite by Sorce. *Korean strawberry milk, pink pepper, vanilla, cherry blossom, cyanide, cashmeran, creamy dreamy sandalwood, cedar* 3.5/5

**What Big Eyes You Have**- light and fluff! Very candy lemon, sweet and sparkly. Unfortunately it’s very faint and vanishes quickly on me, lemon first. It does have the underpinnings of the Sorce Smell, which amps a bit as it dries, but it too is light. I like it but it isn’t a stand out, and it is honestly SO light and short lived. *Immortelle absolute, lemon meringue pie, pearlescent vanilla musk* 3/5, entirely because longevity

**Something Wicked** - This one is probably the most straightforward one I’ve smelled by this house. The whiskey and patchouli are not the dark or gritty variety. It is pretty much evenly divided amongst the notes, none is more prominent than the others. I would like to try it in alcohol. (No “Sorce base” smell, it has no gourmand aspect.) *vanilla, patchouli, sandalwood, and whiskey* 5/5

**Ancient Waters of Venus**- This one reminds me a ton of Dolce & Gabbana’s Devotion; same radiant, uplifting feel to the top notes. It’s entirely happy and feminine. It’s the fragrance equivalent of an adorable pink floaty sun dress. I love the D&G scent and I love this one. It gets a little more tart as it dries down. I’m not really identifying any exact notes, even knowing it’s lychee; it’s just radiant floral-candy sweetness, and I’m here for it.  *An opening of bright, sugared lychee with a hint of almond softens to a delicate blend of pink lotus absolute, peony, siam wood, cool water and rising mist.* 5/5

**Aliens Go Ice Skating**- Oooh, this is the frozen wintry gem I’ve been looking for! It’s not at all remotely related to men’s cologne, either… not marine or aquatic. Sparkling, chilly, wearable. With a nice weird little dash of pepper on top! For about half of its wear time lol. Later on, it gets unfortunately a little band-aid-y, which I associate with a truckload of ambergris or oud, but don’t see those notes here.  Nevertheless, I like it and will wear; it’s this sort of scent that I fascinate on- the artistry of creating something that smells genuinely icy is impressive AF. *winter air, sparkling snow, iris, black pepper, Indian vetiver, peru balsam, cocoa butter, tonka bean butter, tonka bean absolute, cashmere scarves, and a strangely colored sky.* 4/5

**Good At Being Bad**- So very honey! It’s all honey and “Sorce base scent” and it’s a nice one. I don’t always do well with honey; it can kind of turn on me and get a bit revolting, especially if it’s the most prominent note. This one is right on the edge. (Reminds me of a Possets honey from decades back.) *Dark, salted vanilla, buttercream, a swirl of honey, and a whisper of jasmine* 4/5, just because I don’t love honey

**Cake For Breakfast**- Oh my yes that’s a whole lotta buttery cake! Maple frosting, coffee, also present. Somehow, it’s not cloying- or at least, just cloying enough. Not my mood very often, personally, but It does get a little hint of interesting dustiness in later dry down. *Birthday cake, ripe mango, pineapple, coffee, maple syrup, and a hint of cardamom* 3/5, too gourmand for me 

**Where the Wild Things Grow**- strawberry gummy bear! (The organic anemic looking brand from Costco, to be specific.) Faint and short lived.  Gets a hint of greenery later in the dry down. Not bad but I found it kind of boring. *Late spring strawberries still on the vine, vanilla cream soda, fresh green grass with morning dew, and ambrette seed* 3/5

**Fuckery**- Smokey cherry with cinnamon to start with. When it dries, it goes oddly… industrial? I keep thinking it smells lowkey like a Skechers shoe store, and I couldn’t say why… it’s such a strange association. The cherry and cinnamon are mostly gone and the ?shoe store? smell is all that is left. Not exactly bad, just weird. (I think it might be the cherry, amber and white musk smelling like an air freshener I smelled there.) *Caramelized sugar, Luxardo cherry, cinnamon, tobacco, smoke, vanilla, amber, white musk* 2.5/5

**Falling Stars, Sweet Cream**- On brand for how I like my coffee, apparently I also prefer my coffee perfume with cream too. The oud and palo santo in the Black get a bit dusty-weird on me (as is typical of those notes on my skin). The sweet cream smooths them out quite nicely; the coffee is still there… it’s EXTREMELY prominent in the OG, and this blend smooths it out nicely. It definitely has a salted cream smell. The dry down is lovely. *A super-cozy, rich and warm blend of black coffee, almond cream*, sandalwood, natural oud, palo santo oil, tonka bean absolute, and vanilla bean* 5/5

**Moon Magic**- I was quite curious what the non-cookie base would smell like! I think I prefer this one, just a bit. The lavender is more apparent, and the cardamom is really nice, with a soft slightly woody base (from the cashmeran and ambroxan I assume). The lavender is a quality one, no weird edge. I also love the cardamom note Sorce uses. *Lavender sugar, Tonka bean, chai spices, vanilla steamed milk, Cashmeran, Ambroxan, crystals charged by the moonlight.* 5/5

**Witch’s Valentine**- Sorce has a magic touch with flowers IMO. There’s something about the unabashedly *pretty* quality they bring out. This is a fantasy rose, sparkling with sugar candy and fun AF. No green stemmy notes, no almost-sour photorealism; an idealized sweet and fluffy pink rose. *Raspberry puree, Turkish, Moroccan, and Bulgarian rose absolutes, marshmallow, sugar, white chocolate, suede.* 5/5

**English Major**- Fuck yeah, orris! Love it in Guerlain’s Apres L’Ondee, love it in this blend.  It always smells slightly melancholy and grey-cast. This one is mostly bone dry orris and I love that; a hint of sandalwood is there too. Probably I can detect the leaves but they’re merging with the dryness of the iris root. It’s quite different than Sorce’s usual upbeat, sweet and user-friendly catalogue, and I hope they continue releasing more slightly darker work. *Library books, orris absolute, marshmallow, decalepis hamiltonii absolute*, carrot seed, sandalwood, fallen leaves* 5/5

**Serpentine**- Strong Sorce DNA base scent, with some of their awesome cardamom floating through it. Can’t really pick out the fig, it’s more just jammy dark fruit to my nose. Strong and long lasting. *Ripe figs, fig leaf, cardamom, caramelized honey, vanilla, Peru balsam, Cedar, Iso E Super* 5/5


**Sit For A Spell**- This was my least favorite of the bunch, I think it was the rosemary. That with the cantaloupe was a pass for me, especially with the honey. *Salted cantaloupe, a light drizzle of wild rosemary honey, fresh spring air, ambrette seed, and winding honeysuckle vines* 2/5, but if you like melons and rosemary, try it 

**Strings of Light**-  This one just smells like the “Sorce DNA” base with some beautiful amber… and that’s about all I can pick out. Super pretty, very golden feeling (as is apropos!) It isn’t one I’ll full size, most likely, simply because it is not different enough from, say, Snow Moon Magic to need both. *Vanilla milkshake, Haitian vetiver, lavender maillette, beeswax absolute, golden orbs of amber, Ambroxan* 4.5/5",5,1740813915.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

We worked in different departments but frequently passed each other and occasionally had our lunch break together and I would always start a conversation with her usually about how works going, what brought her to town, small stuff. Well she ended up quitting last week and I made a joke to our mutual friend about missing seeing her(bc she’s so pretty) and our friend called her and I guess they talked about me and she told me I should text her bc she was interested in talking to me!

That was about 3-4 days ago, we’ve been texting back and forth since then about random things (hobbies, job stuff , music taste) and I really like talking to her. She’s from Ukraine, super smart, knows 4 different languages fluently, and she’s funny.

So the other day, I suggested hanging out at a place we call broadway , it has tons of restaurants and attractions and a huge pond to walk around. I figured it’s a great place for a first date. And she was down to go with me.

But she texted me today, and one of the places she interviewed at hired her on the spot and she had to cancel because she’ll be starting training. I’ve really never done a real first date  so I was nervous but excited. Now I’m kind of worried that our work schedules could be conflicting and I might not be able to do that Broadway date until she figures out her schedule. Our conversations on text are still responsive but not as exciting as the first two days. I’m just anxious that things might dry up over the next week or two over text. And I really want set up the first date asap so she doesn’t loose interest. should I suggest a smaller meet up like a coffee date or something similar just to see her in person again sooner? the idea of a coffee date kinda gives me anxiety not having different conversation starters like all the attractions broadway would have. any suggestions? should I do something like a simple  quick coffee date just to see each other in person quicker, or hold off until I can do a more fun first date that would have more time constraints if our schedules are conflicting?

I just don’t want to do a boring first date that could end up being awkward just to see her sooner than later, but I’m scared if I wait too long to plan an exciting date she might loose interest ",1,1740813646.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

You know how we talk about masking and how it's exhausting? I never did. I was so bad at social interaction that it never worked out that I wasn't behaving ""right"". I was just super flat (except when I was having a meltdown of course) with everyone all the time. Wasn't until I read about masking at ~35yo that I stated doing it. 

But of course it didn't help. Now I'm just tired and lonely. 

I've tried social groups, I've been through uni, I've had different jobs, yet I don't have anyone in my life (apart from my husband, still don't know how I swung that) who I'm friends with.  I don't have people to go out for coffee with. I don't have gym buddies. I don't have friends from work. I mean there are people at work I'm friendly with, but it never translates to social interaction. I don't even connect with people online. Best (worst?) example of a failed friendship: I was an inpatient in a facility for trauma recovery. It was a long way from home, but one of my fellow inpatients lives literally 150m from me. I can see her house from mine. I tried to stay connected with her once we discharged but she always cancelled last minute until I just stopped trying. There is something about me that puts every single person I meet off. 

I'm so tired of it. And I've gotten to the point where seeing other people's friendship is unbearable. It's like everything in my life is constantly reminding me how isolated I am; people talking about the wedding they are going to on the weekend (I've never been invited to a wedding outside of family). Two people at work were talking about a woman who died, one said ""I didn't know her well, I mean we went to their NYE party but still"". I have never been invited to a NYE party. Memes stating ""when your friends..."" do whatever, it's always something that's never happened to me. We had a fucking wellness presentation at work. The woman said ""we all have that one friend who needs extra support"" I walked out. I don't have that friend who needs extra support. I AM that person, but I have no one to support me. I don't even feel connected to my family. We are civil, but it's like I'm missing the whole portion of my brain that relates to other people.

No. And yet… the question persists, as if the answer would ever change.

For context, we had a blended family of 5 kids, 3 his and 2 mine, and were together for 6 years and married for 2.

About a year or so ago, he wanted to make a movie because that’s his passion so it was not a problem when he chose to do it and I was happy to take care of the kids while he did.
His right hand man was a 28/29 year old woman who I had gone to school with and knew from school.
She was married with her own kids and seemed the type to be a woman’s woman.

My ex and I’s relationship wasn’t perfect and of course we had our problems but we started having significant issues during the last 6 months of our marriage.
Basically, when he started his movie.
I didn’t think much of it at the time but then I started having suspicions when he started pulling away and wanted to end things.
He would be out until the wee hours of the morning and came home often smelling very potently like someone’s perfume.
When I asked him, he admitted it was the girls perfume but said it was because he was in the car with her so much, that’s red flag #1.
She has two small boys who she drives to school every day and if they smelt THAT strongly of perfume, they would definitely have issues with getting made fun of and what not.
Not to mention that he smelt so potently that he even smelt like it when he took his clothes off.

I tried to let it go.

Moving forward he kept becoming more and more distant.
During this time, she was CONSTANTLY loving every single thing of his on his social media, except things involving me and my children.
He finally made the call to break up after us fighting constantly and things just clearly not working.

I have questioned him for months if he was interested in her or going to pursue a relationship with her and all of these things to which he always responded that he’s not interested in getting into another relationship so as not to complicate things with the kids more.

Fast forward to a few days ago and I find out they are in fact together(she left her husband in September, surprise!)and confronted them both with my suspicions that this has been a thing for quite some time.

He vehemently denies any cheating.

However, I cannot draw any other conclusions from the evidence given.
When I even think back to our wedding even, he had invited her to come when she was a mere barista at a local coffee shop and I didn’t think much of it then but was kind of like “why?” And he responded with just that she was nice and we both kind of knew her so why not.

He also has a history of this type of thing.
He has about 5 relationships that have started as “just talking” or “being friends” while he was in another relationship and then ended up with that person.
Also has a history of getting with the women he has in his movies, go figure.
When we got together, he had told me that his wife and him were about to get divorced and he was done in the relationship while he was talking to me.
He clearly had intention while talking and hanging out with me and while nothing ever crossed the line into actually cheating, I’m reevaluating and realizing that talking to and hanging out with intention is absolutely still cheating. 
I now look back on everything and realize that he has done this in all of his relationships and has now done this with me.

I’m so disgusted and angry at myself and him.
I should have seen this a mile away and now children had to be blended and separated.
He literally will not acknowledge the very blatant pattern that he has had and admit that he absolutely was talking and hanging out with her with intention to get with her eventually.
I’m also so grossed out because he’s 46 and she has only just turned 30. 
His oldest daughter is only 10 years older than her and his gf’s father isn’t even 10 years older than himself.
I have even started evaluating our own age gap and realize that it was probably bad too. We got together when I was 26 and he was 39.

Am I overreacting by thinking that there was definitely something going on before we officially ended things?

Finally! My brain stopped holding me hostage and allowed me to hunt around my fully engulfed coffee table...and as Im filling the trash bag Ive grabbed for the occasion, im bringing stuff up to my nose for a sniff....

Finally!  Opened bottle of chocolate Fairlife with about 2 inches of drink left.

Six months. That’s how long it had been since she walked out the door, her suitcase scraping against the floor like nails on a chalkboard. Six months of silence, of pretending I was fine, of scrolling through her Instagram at 3 a.m. like a creep.  

I’d tried everything to move on. Therapy. Yoga. A disastrous attempt at online dating that ended with me ghosting someone because they reminded me of her. But nothing worked. She was everywhere—in the songs we used to sing, in the coffee shop where we had our first date, in the way I still reached for my phone to text her when something funny happened.  

And then, one night, I did something stupid.  

I messaged her.  

Not a long, emotional essay. Not a desperate plea. Just three words: “I miss you.”

I stared at my phone for what felt like hours, waiting for the typing bubbles to appear. When they didn’t, I threw my phone across the room and buried my face in a pillow. *Idiot,* I thought. *You had one job: move on. 

But then, at 7 a.m., my phone buzzed.  

It was her.  

I miss you too,” she wrote. “But I’m scared.”

That message changed everything.  

We met for coffee a week later. She looked the same but different—softer, maybe, or maybe I was just seeing her through new eyes. We talked for hours. About the breakup. About the things we’d both done wrong. About the person I was becoming and the person she wanted to be.  

It wasn’t perfect. It wasn’t a fairy tale. But it was real.  

Today, we’re not back together. Not yet. But we’re talking. We’re healing. And for the first time in months, I feel hopeful.

Moral of the Story:

Sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is reach out. But the real magic happens when you’re willing to grow, to listen, and to let go of the past.

Honestly, I’m glad I’m writing everything down because this really does feel like a love story, and I’m living it. The thing is, most love stories have their share of sadness before reaching a happy ending, and I feel like we’re heading toward that sad turn.

Everything between him and I has been amazing. The morning after I met him to exchange the keys, he went over to my dad’s super early and changed out the vanity. I arrived later that morning and brought him a coffee from McDonald’s as a thoughtful gesture. When I got there we had to run down to the hardware store for plumbing supplies and when we got out of my car he helped me carry the baby while I held my other daughter’s hand.  He’s so warm and welcoming with my children, which is a huge plus.

After finishing the vanity, he asked if I needed help with anything else. I didn’t want him to think I was just using him for favors, so I had him help me with just one AC unit, and that was it. Once everything was done, he didn’t want to leave so we snuck away to my childhood bedroom, and just kissed. Honestly, he’s a wayyyy better kisser now than the first time. 

When he left, I walked him to his car, and he surprised me with a huge jar of maple syrup that he harvests himself. Later that evening he called me and left a voicemail about him being out of service and how busy of a day he had. 

Fast forward to tonight and I’m just so sad… he’s going back downstate which isn’t too far but I’m going back to Florida and it’s the first time ever that I’ve not wanted to. My soul says to stay here, not just for him but to be closer to my family (it’s just me in Florida) and my life long friends. The schools are better here and there is nothing like growing up in the country. I’ll give you guys an update of what happened tonight shortly. For now I’m off to bed since it’s quite late here.

These are my thoughts and interpretations of her answers from our conversation)*

# My Reaction to Meeting Her

I finally met her in person. We sat in a coffee shop for just over an hour, and I asked her everything I could think of. She was nice, remorseful, and emotional, and while I’ll never know how much of it was genuine, she answered every question I had.

It felt surreal seeing her in person—both familiar and entirely foreign. I had spent 25 years imagining this moment, and yet, when it happened, it felt... so small. It wasn’t a tearful embrace (although I did give her a hug) or dramatic confrontation, just a conversation with someone who wasn’t who I thought she was, but also somehow still was.

I fought back tears multiple times. I had to pause, breathe, and collect myself, but she never rushed me. She cried throughout the conversation. I cried, too. I wanted to remain stoic, but I couldn’t… it was all slightly awkward for a fucking Starbucks.

She confirmed most of what I already knew, but some of the biggest questions still unresolved for me was how much of what she told me were lies… at this point I only knew a few key things for sure.  Turns out they were not rare.  They were constant, ranging from huge lies that defined our relationship, to elaborate stories of events that never happened with people that never existed, to little lies that didn’t really affect anything that she told for no discernible reason with nothing to gain.  

I also had thought that maybe she had started off with more lies in the beginning but had become more honest about things as time went on, and recent events may have been mostly true… but everything was filled with lies from the very beginning to the very end. 

She had no grand plan or storyline schemed up. She didn’t think about the long-term consequences. She just did whatever she thought she had to do to keep me in her life.

# What She Admitted to

* Right off the bat she lied about her age - she is two years younger than she told me - so I was 15 and she was just 13… crazy to think this started with just kids talking.
* She acknowledged that I was a safe space for her, but she kept lying because she didn’t know how to stop.
* When I asked if she ever cared about me, she said yes, she did.  It wasn't malicious or sadistic, she did not take pleasure in my pain.
* She said she wanted to meet me, even tried a few times, but always lost the nerve.
* She admitted that she considered making things real but never followed through.
* She said she justified it by compartmentalizing—she knew it was wrong but pushed it out of her mind.
* She admitted she never planned for how this would end. She didn’t have an “end game,” just kept lying as long as she could.
* She admitted she often lied for no reason, even when she had nothing to gain.
* She said the lies were constant from start to finish—there was never a time when she was truly honest with me.
* She didn’t plan out the lies, just made them up as she went along based on what she thought would keep me in her life.
* She didn’t just lie to protect herself—she lied to keep me in her life, no matter what.
* The lies weren’t calculated in advance—she just made things up as she went.
* She never planned to meet me, but she also never planned not to.
* She compartmentalized everything to avoid guilt.
* She admitted that, looking back, she regrets it and wishes she had done things differently.
* She claimed coming clean was spontaneous, but hearing me mention people from her real life made something change. The idea of this spilling over into their lives made her realize she had to stop.

# The Specific Lies She Confirmed

* Her family stories were a mix of truth and fiction—for example, she had a cousin she was close to, but she told me he was her twin brother.  She has a younger sister, but made up a story that she was adopted.  She had an older sister but pretended she did no exist (There might have actually been a reason for this - more on that later)
* Her dad never died in a car crash in 2007—she had an uncle who died in an accident around that time. Her dad is still alive (This stung because my dad passed in 2013, and I had confided in her about my grief, thinking she had been through the same.)
* Her ""abusive ex"" story was mostly true but embellished.
* She grew up in the city she told me, but not in the really rich neighborhood she had described—just a regular middle-class area.
* She never had cancer, kidney failure, or open-heart surgery—all completely fabricated.
* She claimed that she actually does have aphantasia.

# My Immediate Thoughts After Our Meeting

These were my thoughts that I wrote down immediately after she left:

*That was weird... but good. Harder to get through w/o tears than I expected. Didn't manage to remain as stoic as I would have liked.... Good to hear her voice and look her in the eye though.* 

*...Struck by how NOT unattractive she was....I oddly see a world where we got together early before the lies took such a deep hold and we worked out together,* 

*She lied about a LOT though - most hurtful was about the medical issues (heart surgery, kidney failure) - especially the cancer - that was so pivotal to me.... all a lie. She lied about big and small things, w/o reason sometimes.* 

*She did say that the depression, suicidal thoughts, etc. were real, especially early on, and I was a refuge for her and helped her get through it.... That feels good.... something good came out of it....* 

*She said she was able to just ""compartmentalize"" things and not let it weigh down the rest of her life.* 

*She talked about it starting not serious (no consideration of actually meeting) then once she got to know me that changed but felt it was too late to change course... she reasoned to herself that it wasn't hurting me so much... I became a friendship she didn't want to lose*

# Observations/feelings during the conversation

* **Biggest gut punch:** hearing that she faked cancer back in 2006.  I was 19 at the time and she said she had cervical cancer - and even said there was a low chance of survival - thinking that she was going through that, wanting to support her, and believing that I was going to lose her is a huge part of why I chose to ignore my qualms and double down to try and be with her - even if it might take longer than I wanted... that was tough to hear.
* **Biggest insult:** was that she faked a story about needing/having open heart surgery within the last 6 months.  I told her I no longer believed her but as a “last ditch effort”, she said she wanted me to be there when she woke up from surgery, so we had a whole plan that I would come to the hospital - only to claim an excuse for why it needed to be rescheduled or canceled… Goddamn that is crazy.
* I brought notes and she made a joke about how it was very on brand of me and we laughed about it, but **it hurt knowing that she knew me so well**…

# Final Thoughts

There were no grand revelations. 

No satisfying explanations.

No logical reason why this happened.

Just constant deception, fueled by selfishness and fear.

She didn’t plan for how it would end.

She didn’t think about the long-term consequences.

She just kept lying, hoping she’d never have to face reality.

# To Anyone Who Has or is Being Catfished: A Warning

Every situation is different, even if the broad outline is the same. If you have been catfished, **do not feel you need to meet them in person, or that it would go well**. It felt right for me, and I think it was helpful for my closure. But many times, meeting the person would only lead to more pain and, in some cases, could be dangerous.  I’m sharing this because I hope it gives some insight into what and how these people think. But **please, do not assume this is typical.**

# Excerpts from Her Final Email

I do not want to share all of the email she sent me… some of it will forever be only for me, but here are some excerpts:

*""When we first started talking, I was a very insecure girl. I was pretending to be someone better than I was—prettier, wealthier, happier, funnier. Unfortunately, I didn’t grow out of that insecurity… I struggle immensely with being vulnerable with people. My relationship with you allowed me to feel vulnerable and gain the acceptance I craved even with sharing some of my real worst thoughts and actions. It was all wrapped in lies, though. It wasn’t true vulnerability on my part, and it wasn’t true acceptance on your part because you didn’t know the real me… None of this makes my behavior acceptable. I manipulated you. Like you said, I used the best pieces of you against yourself to keep you in my life.""*

*""I think I’m most sorry that my actions have made you question yourself and how wonderful you are. Or that I robbed you of so much happiness. Or maybe that I’ve made you not believe how capable you are. You’re the most capable man I know.""*

*""I still have a lot to learn about why I’ve done this... Even to myself, any reason I come up with feels so lacking. But I do know that I never want to cause someone the pain I’ve caused you. I will do everything I can moving forward to be a better person. I do feel like somewhere in me is good. I’m sorry you knew my cruelty.""*

*""I’m so sorry I did this to you. I hope you find a way to move forward and become yourself again. I hope you find joy and happiness. I hope you find someone that loves you the way that you deserve to be loved.""*

# The Strange, Unbelievable Coincidences That are Actually True

As if all of this wasn’t already surreal enough, I later realized just how close I had been to the truth all along.

* I actually met her older sister in high school—without knowing who she was.
   * This led me to be inside her house once, completely unaware.
* She attended the same university at the same time as me for two years. I was a junior when she was a freshman.
* She now works as a speech pathologist in a nearby school district. (My sister is a teacher, so there is a chance their paths have crossed).

For 25 years, I thought she was just out of reach, only to find out she had been right there, just outside my reality, the entire time.

I don’t know if I’ll ever fully understand why this happened, and I don’t think she truly does either. There are things I’ll always wonder about, but I also know that I don’t need every answer to move on. This entire experience shaped so much of my life, but it won’t define my future. For the first time in a long time, I’m no longer waiting for anything from her. No more questions, no more hoping, no more being stuck in limbo. I finally have the truth—or at least enough of it—and that’s all I needed to walk away.",1,1740811571.0,catfish,0,1.0,False

I’m so mad that even at 26, with my SISTER I still get social anxiety attacks. We generally go out every night for like a coffee and most nights I’m looking forward to it, but this week I keep making excuses bc I’m scared of the awkward silence, bc I don’t feel social these days. I’m in an awkward funk where every sentence I’m phrasing is coming out strange and weird toned and I feel like everyone can read my mind that I suddenly feel awkward bc I start getting strange and goofy in my tone, and people react like “ahaha….yeaaaah…”

So we were driving to the coffee place and for like 15 minutes we were talking, and it wasn’t awkward at all. Suddenly, I became hyper aware that I was doing very well conversationally, and then immediately felt extremely awkward and suddenly every single word coming out of my mouth was so forced. I hate it when I stop freestyling and all of a sudden notice I feel awkward, I literally don’t know how to recover. I try to disregard the thought and get back to the passion of how I was talking, but I can’t disregard it.

I guess it wasn’t too bad and I technically kept conversation going okay, she made us drive past our house bc she wanted to keep hanging out, but I felt so awkward after that. We’re probably going to run errands tomorrow and I’m scared of being in the car with her for like 4-5 hours doing things. What’s wrong with me LMAO, why can’t I even relax around my sister? I’ve processed this so so much in therapy and I can’t win. When does social anxiety end. How do you disregard when you start noticing that you feel awkward? I literally can’t and from that point on I start stumbling and stuttering on my words. I hate this.",4,1740811508.0,socialskills,3,1.0,False

TLDR: Just read it, or get your innie to do it for you



This show never fails to hide as much detail as they can in EVERY SINGLE SCENE. I happened to pause at just the right time during this sub second clip at 17:04. This may be a tiny stretch of a theory, I just did some research and found some really interesting parallels between the history of this poster and the happenings in the show. 

FIRST OFF, the white cursive script above Mark's left shoulder **""aidez-moi!"" Translates from french to ""Help ME!""....** that alone deserves its own post but I'm about to go MUCH deeper. 

The poster in its entirety reads ""les souscritions a l'emprunt national sont recues a la banque nationale de credit"" translated in French to ""subscriptions to the national loan are received by the national credit bank"". 

OK great, what does that mean and what does it have to do with the show; but first its important to understand the history behind this shady french bank. Founded in 1913, banque nationale de credit, or (BNC), devoured roughly 40 smaller banks while simultaneously sprouting hundreds of branches across France. (the subscriptions to other banks were received by this bank) By 1922, it commanded 442 agencies nationwide. The bank's aggressive hunters systematically stalked new customers, luring them from competitors with better terms. Behind a façade of normal banking operations, Vincent installed a shadow team of financiers whose sole purpose was channeling depositors' money to his companies. BNC's voracious appetite proved its undoing. The bank that wouldn't stop growing finally collapsed in the 1932 financial crisis as a victim of its own insatiable hunger for expansion.

(side note) I don't know what the connection is yet but Mark being a WWI historian and this being a WWI era crisis have to have some connection 

The main point I want to hit home is the similarities between the BNC's efforts to hide their true motives behind the vail of normality, and Lumons focus on separating the nightmares in the basement and what is to everyone else, just a mega corporation that has grown to encompass their lives. Beyond the shady practices preformed by both Lumon and the BNC, they share a common motif in corporate greed and expansion. Its shown that Lumon has created not one but hundreds of company towns around the world, producing everything from coffee makers to medical equipment, with the constant drive to keep developing  their technology and force it into the hands of their consumers. its not crazy to say this could be the future of the severance program.

This aggressive expansion is what lead to the inevitable collapse of the BNC, if Lumon takes this same path with severance it could be what causes it's collapse...  There is some other small parallels but this was my most founded understanding, if you find anything else please let me know.

I know its a small detail from a tiny clip in the show, but as you all know EVERYTHING in this was intentional and they may be showing us the story line in plain sight. 

I've found some other tiny details like this and will post them soon, in the meantime id love any feedback, comments, or further research into this idea!",6,1740810336.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,6,0.88,False
1j0t5so,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingIvyLeague/comments/1j0t5so/chances_of_being_accepted_by_yale/,Chances of being accepted by Yale?,"I'm an 18F, applying to Yale for the 2025 year. A little bit of backstory, I had to defer a year from going to the current planned college, UTK, because I had been diagnosed with cancer and a brain tumor. Been doing chemotherapy for a couple months.  


Anyway, my grades are pretty good. Unweighted, it's a 3.9. I've taken all the APs my public school made available as well (4), all passed with 3s (:/). My SAT and ACT score... I decided to go blind. I'm not sure if that'll bite me in the butt, but showing off a 25 ACT isn't the best idea. 

I participated in select softball for my Freshman and Sophomore year, placing first in two tournaments and second in one. I played Tennis in Senior year, before the tumor in my head exploded (yikes). I had also participated in student council and the Lions club, which held volunteer events, where I was the treasurer for two years.

The volunteering also led me to create and fund my own local arts club in our small town for fall and winter, gaining grants from arts build and using the lions club house as the location. I had helped realize and work in an in-school coffee shop/convenience store/merch store. Learned how to make coffee, keep budget of our items, and screen print shirts (which I made a couple designs for).

That leads me to a couple more things outside of school, my art and small business. I have an art portfolio of 20 pieces, all varying from traditional painting to electronic. I've gone to events and sold said art, participated in the county fair and placed first and second both years I submitted, and had my art placed in the hunter museum. I have never had an art teacher.

I've been helping a family friend co-run an earring business by drafting designs, budgeting, and marketing. This business, since my help, has done better in sales.

As for diversity, I'm very white. I'm a cisgendered woman and bisexual from Tennessee. My family is low income and most of our budget has been going into chemo treatment. I would also be a first generation. I was diagnosed with cancer the last quarter of high school, but I managed to keep my grades up, started working on the small business, and continued volunteering.

I've been talking to this guy for almost a year now and we finally met. For me it was a good first meeting as I am someone who is incredibly shy and it does take me a while to get comfortable. 

We met at a mall, he did some shopping for himself, we had a nice cup of coffee, we chatted and then we went our separate ways. Even though he has seen me prior on video calls and pictures but I was still nervous about him not liking how I looked.

Anyway, he was nothing but sweet to me, he ordered for me and paid, he made sure I was comfortable even though I was a nervous wreck. I was really shy and I feel like it showed. 

I also did one stupid thing but I realised it when I got back home. We were just sitting and comparing our phones so he cutely took his phone case off and put it on mine and gave my phone back to me. He was smiling and asked how it look. I SAID IT LOOKS NICE BUT IT'S TOO LEMONY..LEMONY?! then I proceeded to give his case back to him 😅 he was looking directly at me, I got nervous and I fumbled. He's probably thinking I hated the case or the gesture. Which I didn't but I realised that his phone case was expensive and it wouldn't have been okay to just take it 😭

  
We left on a good note and 15 minutes after we left he texted me 'Thank you for today.' I obviously was elated. I thanked him for the coffee and told him I had a wonderful time. He said that he did too. Then I made a funny comment like 'Really? I didn't scare you?' then he told me that I couldn't scare anyone because I was nice and sweet.

We had a bit of small talk after that and we haven't talked since. It's been 2 days now.

Well, **welcome to Bali**—the kind of place that makes your travel bucket list look like a warm-up.

[How To plan a perfect 7-day Bali tour itinerary?](https://preview.redd.it/3yhko68es0me1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8f45d0c35a3ee2122e8db458f4081d3bc505f2b)

Planning a trip to Bali can feel overwhelming—there’s just **so much to do**! One moment, you’re picturing yourself in an infinity pool in Ubud, the next, you’re wondering if you should spend more time in Uluwatu or Nusa Penida. No worries, I got you! **This 7-day itinerary** is designed to give you a mix of Bali’s best: **beaches, temples, waterfalls, cultural gems, and pure adventure—without burning you out.** And if you want a stress-free experience, booking [private tours in Bali](https://forevervacation.com/tours-in-bali) can be a total game-changer! You'll get a local guide, a comfy ride, and zero hassle—so you can just focus on soaking up paradise.

# Best Time to Visit Bali

Alright, let’s talk timing—because **when** you visit Bali can totally shape your experience. You don’t want to plan your dream getaway only to get stuck in non-stop rain or massive crowds, right? So, let’s break it down.

**Dry Season vs. Wet Season: What’s the Best Time?**

Bali has two main seasons:

* **Dry Season (April – October):** This is hands down the **best time to visit**! Expect sunny days, clear skies, and perfect beach weather. It’s also the best time for outdoor adventures like snorkeling, hiking, and exploring waterfalls. But heads up—it’s also **peak tourist season**, so popular spots like Ubud and Seminyak can get pretty packed.
* **Wet Season (November – March):** Bali is still beautiful, but expect **heavy rain showers**, especially in December and January. If you’re looking for fewer crowds and cheaper prices, this could be a good option—just pack a rain jacket and prepare for occasional downpours.

**When Should You Go? My Honest Take**

* **Best overall months:** May, June, and September – perfect balance of great weather and fewer crowds.
* **Want to avoid peak season madness?** Skip July and August—they’re the busiest months.
* **On a budget?** Go in February or March. You’ll get great deals on hotels and private tours in Bali!

# Bali Travel Essentials: What You Need to Know Before You Go

Alright, before you get lost in daydreams of Bali’s beaches and rice terraces, let’s cover the **must-know basics**. Trust me, knowing these things ahead of time will save you a ton of headaches once you land.

# 1. Visa Requirements & Travel Documents

* Most travelers can get a Visa on Arrival (VoA) for around IDR 500,000 (\~$35 USD) at the airport.
* If you're staying under 30 days, you’re good with just the VoA. Want to stay longer? You’ll need to extend it or get a 60-day visa in advance.
* Your passport should have at least 6 months of validity—they will turn you away if it doesn’t!

# 2. Currency & Money Matters

* Bali uses the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR). The exchange rate fluctuates, but 1 USD = \~15,000 IDR (so yeah, you’ll feel like a millionaire).
* Cash is king! While big restaurants and hotels accept credit cards, small shops, markets, and local warungs (restaurants) prefer cash.
* Avoid sketchy exchange booths—stick to official money changers like Central Kuta Money Exchange or withdraw cash from ATMs inside banks.

# 3. SIM Cards & Internet

* Don’t rely on WiFi—it can be slow. Get a local SIM card at the airport or stores like **Telkomsel or XL** for fast, cheap data.
* Or, if you want hassle-free internet from the moment you land, grab an eSIM before your trip!

# 4. Getting Around Bali

* [**Private Bali Tours**](https://forevervacation.com/tours-in-bali)**:** If you want a hassle-free way to explore Bali, **private tours** are the best option. These tours include a personal driver who takes you to Bali’s top attractions on a customized itinerary.
* **Scooter rentals:** Cheap and fun, but only rent if you’re comfortable riding! Traffic is wild, and accidents happen. Always wear a helmet!
* **Private drivers in Bali:** The best way to explore stress-free, especially for long day trips. Expect to pay around IDR 600,000 – 900,000 (\~$40-$60 USD) per day for a car + driver.
* **Ride-sharing apps:** Grab & Gojek are lifesavers for short rides, but some areas (like Ubud) limit their use.

# 5. Packing Tips: What to Bring & What to Skip

* Light, breathable clothes—it’s hot and humid!
* A sarong (or buy one there) for temples.
* Sunscreen (reef-safe, please!)—it’s crazy expensive in Bali.
* Mosquito repellent (trust me, you’ll need it).
* A reusable water bottle—Bali’s tap water isn’t safe to drink.
* Skip bringing **heels, bulky luggage, or too many fancy outfits**—you’ll be living in swimsuits, sandals, and comfy clothes 90% of the time.

# The Perfect 7-Day Bali Itinerary: A Day-by-Day Guide

Now for the fun part—planning your Bali adventure. This **7-day itinerary** is designed to give you the perfect mix of relaxation, adventure, culture, and scenic beauty. Along the way, I'll include **insider tips** to help you avoid tourist traps and make the most of your trip.

# Day 1: Arrival in Bali & Exploring Seminyak

Your Bali adventure begins as you land at Ngurah Rai International Airport (DPS). The first day is all about easing into the island's rhythm, shaking off the jet lag, and getting a feel for the local vibe.

[Seminyak Bali](https://preview.redd.it/1mdc3p4os0me1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06b5290a6563b7b6569f5fb248635d5062d22d79)

# What to Do on Day 1:

* **Relax on Seminyak Beach** – Grab a drink and enjoy the sunset.
* **Explore Eat Street** – Popular spots include Nalu Bowls for smoothie bowls and Sea Circus for tacos and cocktails.
* **Beach club experience** – Try Potato Head Beach Club or Ku De Ta for drinks, music, and ocean views.

**Pro Tip:** If you want to start your trip stress-free, book a [private airport transfer](https://forevervacation.com/bali-private-airport-pick-up-service) in advance instead of haggling with taxi drivers.

# Day 2: Ubud – Bali’s Cultural and Spiritual Hub

On day two, head to **Ubud**, the heart of Bali’s culture, lush landscapes, and jungle vibes. This town is known for its rice terraces, traditional markets, and serene temples.

[Ubud, Bali](https://preview.redd.it/thsnysovs0me1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a18e60a231cc0222e30e9c7be4f07cfa439d3f9)

# What to Do in Ubud:

* **Visit the Sacred Monkey Forest** – A nature reserve with ancient temples and free-roaming monkeys.
* **Explore Ubud Art Market** – Great for handcrafted souvenirs, woven bags, and local artwork.

* **Bali Swing** – If you want the famous jungle swing photo, this is the place.
* **Sunset at Campuhan Ridge Walk** – A peaceful trail with scenic views.

**My Recommendation:** A [**private Ubud tour**](https://forevervacation.com/tours-in-ubud) is the easiest way to explore multiple spots in one day without worrying about transport.

# Day 3: Waterfalls & Temples Road Trip

Today is about discovering Bali’s breathtaking waterfalls and ancient temples.

https://preview.redd.it/db9jf1o2w0me1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02053ffff2091ab35050dd36fef32e0c71a06a0a

# Top Picks for Day 3:

* **Tegenungan Waterfall** – A scenic waterfall near Ubud, perfect for a refreshing swim.
* **Tukad Cepung Waterfall** – A unique waterfall hidden inside a cave.
* **Tirta Empul Water Temple** – A sacred temple where visitors can take part in a traditional water purification ritual.
* **Goa Gajah (Elephant Cave)** – An ancient temple with intricate carvings and a peaceful setting.

**Pro Tip:** The waterfalls can get crowded in the afternoon, so visit them early. I am sure, booking [**Bali's Breathtaking Waterfall Tour**](https://forevervacation.com/bali-breathtaking-waterfall-tour) makes this day much easier since the locations are spread out.

# Day 4: Nusa Penida Island Snorkelling Adventure

Nusa Penida, an island off the coast of Bali, is known for its dramatic cliffs, hidden beaches, crystal-clear water, and most beautiful snorkelling points. It’s a must-visit if you’re looking for adventure and jaw-dropping views.

[Nusa Penida Snorkelling Bali](https://preview.redd.it/pxp2fia3t0me1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd7844b05892c0f8fbaedd8323569d38971a3876)

# What to Do on Nusa Penida:

* **Kelingking Beach (""T-Rex Cliff"")** – One of the most famous viewpoints in Bali.
* **Broken Beach & Angel’s Billabong** – Stunning natural rock formations and a natural infinity pool.
* **Crystal Bay** – A great spot for snorkeling and relaxing.

**A Tip For You:** For an unforgettable experience, consider a [Nusa Penida snorkeling tour](https://forevervacation.com/bali-nusa-penida-snorkeling-adventure) to explore vibrant coral reefs and swim with majestic manta rays at Manta Bay, Gamat Bay, and Crystal Bay.

# Day 5: Uluwatu & Southern Bali – Clifftop Views and Beach Hopping

Southern Bali is famous for stunning cliffs, white-sand beaches, and legendary sunsets.

[Uluwatu](https://preview.redd.it/4pu2zgg9t0me1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e322cb1269f5fc96be22bd66f9b913605b9ec095)

# Best Things to Do in Uluwatu:

* **Melasti Beach & Padang Padang Beach** – Two of Bali’s most beautiful beaches.
* **Uluwatu Temple** – A sacred temple perched on a dramatic clifftop.
* **Kecak Fire Dance** – A cultural dance performance at Uluwatu Temple during sunset.
