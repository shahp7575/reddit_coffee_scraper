1hwd4vb,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1hwd4vb/we_only_agreed_for_a_coffee_meetup_to_feel/,We only agreed for a coffee meet-up to feel comfortable but then I sucked him an hour later,"He reached out to me on X (formerly Twitter), and although his proposition was nice and straightforward, I remained wary since his account seemed like it might belong to a bot. However, once we moved to Telegram and exchanged phone numbers, my doubts began to fade. Him driving an hour from his place to mine, and then me climbing into his G-Wagon, confirmed he wasn't just any regular guy.

He's from S.A., and I'd never met anyone from there before, so this was a first for me. We talked as we cruised around the neighborhood near the beach, looking for something to drink. We shared a passionate kiss in a parking lot. What was initially planned as a brief meet-up to get comfortable with each other soon turned into my agreeing to go to his house. Despite his young age, he spoke with substance; he's into real estate. We picked up some smoothies and headed to his place.

He shared that he had his first sexual experience with another guy a few months back, but that guy had returned home, leaving him eager for companionship. He complimented my X posts, explaining that was why he wanted to meet me. He admitted to being relatively new to this, seeking intimacy and companionship, which I was happy to share, especially after what had happened to me the previous night.

We shared another hot, passionate kiss, hugged, and I played with his nipples, which he enjoyed. I then gave him oral pleasure, and we cuddled again, feeling inseparable for the next half hour. After spending 2.5 hours together, it was time to part ways, especially since his brother was in the next room.

He drove me back, holding my hand while an Arabic song played at full volume, with the Burj Khalifa skyline in view. I felt like I was in a dream, on cloud nine. It was crazy. He was also thoughtful enough to offer advice on my job search, considering my current situation. He's truly something special.

How often would you turn a coffee meet-up to a sexual interaction?

Would you hook up with a curious straight guy years younger than you?",1,1736316502.0,askgaybros,1,1.0,False

So, I wouldn't say that I'm a first time cat owner, had a gentle boy for 10 years. After he passed, a few months later my dad brought me a kitten he found on the side of the road. He was around 4 weeks old. I took him in and he's an inside cat ever since. Yesterday he was scheduled for neutering, and in the morning (around 6am) I was getting ready for work. I donned my usual gear, a leather jacket, jeans and a black shoe with white stripes. This is when it began. He switched to an aggressive stance, howling aggressively, hissing, and trying to attack my leg, and not letting me out(I was afraid he would go outside). I somehow could get out, and immediately texted my gf to be careful when she came home(she had no problem whe she left). When I got home in the evening he was still drowsy from the meds but otherwise calm. This morning I got up, gave him food, and had some coffee. I'm a smoker so I went outside to have a smoke with my coffee. I wore my jacket with a pair of slippers(very fashionable) and he had no problem with it whatsoever. He was friendly and gentle up until the point where my gf and I were ready to leave. We had our jackets and shoes on and again like he didn't recognise us, and again acting aggressively, even scratched my hand quite badly (he usually scratches me when we play but not this hard). When my gf got home, he was gentle again even laid in my gf's lap, and been his regular self ever since. Everyone else had a problem like this before? What can I do?

Anyways, I'm going to talk about what we SKKs eat at Griffin:

Unlike dolls who get to enjoy food from Springfield's cafe free of charge, SKKs have meals served at the pantry and cooked by machines. They are so bland it made WA2000's cooking taste like gourmet food..   
  
Breakfast consists of a simple sandwich with peanut butter jelly, a slice of banana and coffee. We have to eat while at work starting at 9am and we only have 15 minutes to finish them. This is the only ""good food"" we have compared to lunch and dinner.

Lunch consists of mashed potatoes (with no gravy), broccoli, spinach (yucks!), rice and occasionally chicken meat or steamed fish. On a good day we will have pasta that is hard and tomato sauce. Fruits can be an apple or a slice of watermelon. For drinks we will have flavored water. 

Dinner, we have something better: Fried chicken, beef or battered fish, coleslaw, a slice of bland fruit cake, buttered rice and gravy. Sometimes we will have fries and onion rings. You may think it tastes good but trust me, its not. Its served undercooked and nasty to eat. Drinks, we will have fruit juice or carbonated drinks. It made me appreciate plain water even more.

I remember my first lunch, I went to the SKK washroom and vomited everything. I couldn't stomach the crap food and I almost had a stomachache from eating it. I'd rather eat MREs than this shit

Anyways, I have gotten used to the food. At least I won't be hungry and I should be grateful for that.

Just wanna ask around in case got staff or ex staff here knows the coffee brand, since i got moka pot laying around never use before might want to try make own coffee.

1hwcvhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hwcvhh/transitional_period_advice_needed/,Transitional Period- Advice Needed,"Hi everyone. I recently graduated college last month and I've been on the job search grind since around September. I'm looking to relocate out of state, and as such, I have been applying for jobs primarily in those locations. I'm facing a bit of a dilemma about what to do before I can secure a job out of state. I'm currently living with my parents, but our deal is that I have until February to get employed. I've been struggling pretty hard with getting any interviews (job market sucks, oversaturated industry, the usual). I've sent nearly 200 apps and got a total of 1 interview out of it. I'm still waiting to hear back from many, but I find it unlikely that I'll get anything by February with the way it has been going. Now, I do imagine it would be easier to get a job here in my home state, as there's less competition (nobody wants to live here lmao). However, I am absolutely desperate to get out of here, and my worst fear is starting a job here and then feeling trapped and like I can't leave.

So, I'm wondering if it would be a better idea to just get a temporary job working somewhere like a coffee shop or something so I can focus on my job search and save up some money without committing to a company that's expecting me to stay. I'm really worried about being offered a job here and accepting it, and then getting an offer from somewhere out of state. I just don't want to waste an employer's time with onboarding and training me, just to leave them after a month or two. Also, I don't want to look like a job hopper and burn professional bridges. All this to say, I just think it makes more sense for me to obtain some sort of temp employment that has nothing to do with my degree, than to risk getting trapped in a place I hate or upset a team that took the time to hire me. My parents think it's no biggie, but they grew up in an entirely different job market where things like not staying at a job long maybe didn't matter. These days, though...getting a job is already impossible without making yourself look bad on paper.

I said nothing about it but I decided that I wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúcoming home‚Äù from college. 

9 years ago I moved to where I am now, being careful to accept no help of any sort from you. You kept in contact and stayed mostly cordial so I let you stay in my life.

8 years ago we were speaking but I was growing to realize more and more what kind of personality you have and wasn‚Äôt sure staying cordial was worth it. Not sure what to do yet, I let you stay in my life.

7 years ago I lost any realistic hope for us to have a relationship. You had started with the insults, the name-calling, and the belittling. I cut you out for the first time since I left college, but not for long.

6 years ago, I was struggling to figure out why I couldn‚Äôt seem to keep you out of my life. You would say something horrible, I would cut you out, then feel guilty for cutting you out, so I‚Äôd let you back in‚Ä¶ over and over. I cut you out again, this time for a whole year.

5 years ago you texted me something ‚Äúprofound‚Äù on New Year‚Äôs Eve. My reply was to you was that you couldn‚Äôt just wiggle back into my life and pretend that nothing was wrong anymore. Your response was to explode on me, disown me, and write me an entire story about how a random man whose name I had never heard before was actually my father, how he shot himself to get my mom to have pity sex with him, and that I was never yours. I blocked you, this time for only 8 months.

4 years ago I was keeping you out better, but kept finding myself in cycles of guilt where I‚Äôd get to a certain point of time after yet another one of your episodes and let you back in before I felt that keep you out was wrong somehow. I was getting ready to start grad school and sent you a coffee mug from their gift shop as a little life update to say ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm doing a thing.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt expecting you to contact me after this. I let you back in and immediately shut you out again because you went straight to the name calling, insults, and dehumanizing. I changed my entire name ‚Äî first, middle, and last ‚Äî legally, not just because I felt it suited me better, but also as a tangible way to put distance between us.

3 years ago we (fortunately) were not speaking. I was doing a much better job of keeping you out. Until one day when l contacted you while drunk.

2 years ago it felt like we were attempting to build a relationship. You had started being kind to me so I was letting you back in. I was hopeful, but not optimistic. I then found out that you were now treating my brother poorly who you had used to treat like your golden child. As it turned out, because I was more successful than him, you now saw me as the golden child and him as the screwup. You weren‚Äôt actually getting better - you just swapped our places in your mind. I coldly and sternly told you to leave him alone, that I was used your abuse and manipulation and he wasn‚Äôt and thus he didn‚Äôt know how to handle it and navigate these situations with you. Realizing you could no longer just buddy up to one of your kids to feel like a good parent, you flipped on both of us. I shut you out.


1 year ago we were not speaking again. This time was almost a whole calendar year. 

8 days ago you texted me from your wife‚Äôs phone to say she saw I had unfriended her on social media. You said you found out where I was going to be a certain day and were going to come and see me. I politely told you I would be unavailable. You didn‚Äôt know I had unfriended her because I knew you were using her profile to keep tabs on my life via social media. You also didn‚Äôt know I left her number unblocked only so that she could notify me if you ever die. Accepting what it means, I then blocked her number.

7 days ago you contacted me via other means to wish me a happy new year. I blocked that as well.

The past week I have been struggling with the same things I always have after contact with you ‚Äî panic attacks, mood swings, feelings of dissociation, trouble sleeping, trouble focusing, trouble with appetite regulation, and trouble engaging with my friends.

Please. Please. I am begging you. Please don‚Äôt try to contact me again. I can‚Äôt keep doing this. I‚Äôve worked so hard to love myself enough to function socially and professionally. It takes so much elapsed time between our contacts for me to feel okay again. Please stop trying to come back in. It‚Äôs not fair that I should have to block all means for you to find me.

I need to get out of here. I‚Äôve grown up my whole life being criticized. As the eldest daughter, I have had to lead an example to my youngest brother (18M). However, my entire life, I have always been picked on for being too fat or too skinny, too lazy, too rude, too sensitive, too needy. I have never been good enough. My body image issues especially come from my mother. 

Due to the insecurities I have depsite being obedient and quiet, I get really sensitive to food topics. I was in the kitchen making coffee and complained that my knee hurts and my mother immediately ‚Äúasks‚Äù me if I have been eating too much gluten. To a regular person, this seems like a fair question. However, my mother has always used these situations where I am in pain to blame it on the food I am eating, eventually shaming me. I was immediately annoyed and replied ‚Äúno‚Äù with an annoyed tone. She starts getting defensive and I just say ‚Äúok‚Äù and move on, to avoid more conflict. I was not in the mood for another lecture. She then gets up and walks towards me saying ‚ÄúI need to say something or I am going to explode‚Äù and starts ranting about how she has always been nice to me and I shouldn‚Äôt get so defensive over a ‚Äúsimple question.‚Äù She then starts crying and says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been a bad mom,‚Äù etc. I just honestly couldn‚Äôt feel bad anymore. 

This was the same guilt trip measures she has been using ever since I started setting boundaries. I haven‚Äôt even yelled at her.

However, if I get upset, I get called sensitive. I am tired. I have done everything she has told me to do. I have kept my mouth shut for years. 

The one thing keeping me from moving out is she needs help paying the house, and I feel bad to leave her without my financial help. I don‚Äôt know if I should endure it until my brother moves out or if I should just leave as soon as I can.",2,1736315408.0,whatdoIdo,4,0.75,False

How do I get the mold fixed without risking eviction ,"I also have posted this to r/legaladvice in the hopes of getting more answers! 

Black mold left untreated for 7 months bathroom but I have more pets than my rental lease allows. What do I do so I don‚Äôt get evicted or sick from the mold?

Hi Reddit, 

I have been renting a historic apartment in Baltimore city for the past 3 years. Given that the apartment is an old townhouse (probably from the late 1800s) that was converted into apartments it is both gorgeous and has its fair share of ~old house~ problems. This was expected. 

In May of ‚Äò24 i reported to my landlord via the tenant portal that there was a leak in the crevice of the ceiling in my bathroom. They sent a repairman who opened up the ceiling and even got permission to turn on water from apartments in the floor above mine, but were unable to locate any leak. He said his best guess was that someone overflowed their bathtub or sink and hoped it wouldn‚Äôt happen again but couldn‚Äôt really promise anything. He patched the ceiling back up and I thought it was all good.

About a month later in June ‚Äò24, I noticed that the ceiling was wet in the same place and reported it again via the tenant portal. I didn‚Äôt hear anything back so I made a third post to the tenant portal in July ‚Äò24. At this point, black mold had started to grow between the ceiling and the wall. I didn‚Äôt hear back. I went to update that same post only to find that my posts from June and July had been closed because they were ‚Äúduplicates‚Äù of the one I originally made in May. 

Between July and now (January‚Äô25) the mold has continued to grow and I even found water stains that had dripped all the way down the wall, onto the shower, and into the bathtub where it left yellow marks. Last Friday ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù came through to do an inspection of the apartments. The property manager (who is NOT the owner) told me privately that the managers doing the inspection were actually the sole owner of my building but that he likes to keep that quiet for some reason. She also told me that the reason she hadn‚Äôt replied to my maintenance requests (which she clearly had read based on our conversation) was because the building‚Äôs maintenance guy had quit back in June ‚Äò24‚Ä¶.she told me to ask the owner when I could expect to see the mold resolved. When I did, he brushed me off and didn‚Äôt give me a date or even time span. 

He and his assistant entered my apartment, asked about any issues, took pictures of the mold, peeling paint on the ceiling in my bedroom, cracked window pane, the serial numbers of the appliances etc etc. 

I know I can call the city‚Äôs non emergency line and report the issue, but hadn‚Äôt (until today) because I have quite a few small reptiles and invertebrates as well as a cat and bird that I‚Äôm definitely not meant to have and are not in my lease (I do pay pet rent, but the lease caps the number of animals at 2). I worried that if I took action and reported the issue to the city that the owner would retaliate by evicting me for violating my lease by keeping additional pets. When the owner inspected he did ask about the many terrariums and enclosures I have throughout my apartment. I answered that they were ‚Äúmostly empty‚Äù and that I build terrariums and keep tropic plants as a hobby (both true, I have loads of half finished terrariums and enclosures scattered throughout the enclosures and terrariums that actually do have animals in them). I didn't provide additional details. 

After talking it over with my partner (who lives separately) and returning from a trip over the holidays I went to bed in my apartment like usual. The bathroom with the mold is the only one in my apartment unit and is located in my bedroom. i habitually keep the door open so my cats can use the litterbox I keep in there.

Recently, he‚Äôs gotten a promotion and a bonus and has wanted to celebrate his wins. I am totally game for celebratory drinks, but oftentimes, it goes beyond celebratory to the point where I have to take care of him. 

He drinks regularly throughout the week and has started drinking whiskey in his morning coffees. There isn‚Äôt a day that he doesn‚Äôt have a drink and I can‚Äôt even recall a day when he had just one of anything. 

We‚Äôve been to two weddings in the past year and he blacked out at both of them. He‚Äôs never violent, but can be nonsensically belligerent, so I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs easier to just go along with what he says and feign a good mood or risk sending him down a path that makes it difficult for me to manage him. 

I‚Äôve talked to him about his drinking, but he always brushes it off or makes excuses. I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to approach the subject without him getting frustrated with me or telling me it‚Äôs not a big deal. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs normal to start your day with a shot of whiskey and then end it with 3 glasses of whiskey and some beers. I know that sometimes he also has a craft beer at lunch.

He can be gregarious and funny, so people often find him fun to be around when he‚Äôs had a few drinks in him, but I just want to be able to talk to my husband, not this other version of himself.

A LIVE Coffee Morning Review","So I had to wonder if I had the right video. It's Groundhog Day or something....?
Anyway G starts by saying her live isn't starting until now at 1130 because funpeas ""had a very long lie-in"". Tbh he still looked tired. (What time is bedtime? Yikes.)
Anyway funpeas is perhaps truant from nursery today as G is not quite certain if it's supposed to be a day off for him or not. Oh well, multitasking it is then.
Then we go 10 minutes at least with showing Tim's Christmas gift of a new automatic coffee machine, complete with many boxes of drink pods, one of which is ....chocolate milk? G asks for a group vote on which pod to brew whilst lamenting that she is not sponsored by either Starbucks or Nescaf√© 
G doesn't wish to do a vlog on her Christmas gifts because Holly did one (huh? Ok.) She thinks the coffee maker may be an indication that Tim ""ran out of ideas"".
There's a few super chats for a birthday gift for funpeas. Then there's people suggesting they'll come to the big birthday party for funpeas when they have one next year. This year will be low key.

Next topic is the ""skank"" who paid to infiltrate the New Year's gig chat with apparently gross comments directed towards the baby.
G wonders aloud ""should I even have funpeas on camera if there is the likes of that out there?""
(The answer is NO, actually you shouldn't--for that reason and a myriad of others)
She then answered her own question by saying 
""But at the same time the decent quality people that are on my channel have watched funpeas grow and feel like they're part of his life too so it would be a shame to take that away.""
(Yeah that's actually another reason why he shouldn't be on camera, you don't actually know these people and it's just WEIRD to develop a parasocial relationship with a child who is a stranger to you.)

G says it never occurred to her that moderators would be necessary in a paid livestream.......? 
We then launch into ""the problem with freedom of speech"" and how it means that people are allowed to become a bully, which isn't ok.
Personal attacks are noted to a problematic part of freedom of speech.
Then G gives some odd examples of what she means about free speech by going on about McDonald's, blonde hair, and Tyson Fury. (Who the hell is Tyson Fury? Am I supposed to know this person?)

She notes that she has ""taken advice"" regarding any future inappropriate comments directed about the baby.

She also says she would never deliberately go on the attack towards someone. Which is certainly interesting to hear after witnessing her takedown of that girl in the airport regarding the outfit she was wearing. Nor is that the only example so.....yeah.

Then some exhaustive gobbledygook and conjecture about the person who made the comments and what their life entails and G advises they should perhaps ""take up Pilates"" or ""go to Pontins"" (What?!?!?) She offers her condolences to the person.

Her next vlog will be posted tomorrow regarding their trip to a London hotel for Tim's channel. G admits that this trip was the usual ""last minute dot com"" in regard to planning and preparation (are we even surprised at this point? We know that Tim flies by the seat of his zipper jeans for anything content-related).
""As always time is a massive problem in life isn't it?"" (Sigh).

She closes out by showing photos on her laptop, complete with glaring ring light reflection (üò°üò°üò°) of a channel member who recently took a trip to Lapland and sent photos to G. Then while discussing dog sleds in Lapland she drops this bomb:
""Tim's there at the moment-- well actually he's flying back -but he's just been there experiencing it all""

(What on earth? Why??? He just went there with G and funpeas, plus he's been there alone at least 2? 3? other times?)

Lastly someone commented about funpeas' hair routine and G replies that it always looks like ""the Jackson five"" whenever she combs out his curls first thing in the morning (I can't even....)

I have been renting a historic apartment in Baltimore city for the past 3 years. Given that the apartment is an old townhouse (probably from the late 1800s) that was converted into apartments it is both gorgeous and has its fair share of ~old house~ problems. This was expected. 

In May of ‚Äò24 i reported to my landlord via the tenant portal that there was a leak in the crevice of the ceiling in my bathroom. They sent a repairman who opened up the ceiling and even got permission to turn on water from apartments in the floor above mine, but were unable to locate any leak. He said his best guess was that someone overflowed their bathtub or sink and hoped it wouldn‚Äôt happen again but couldn‚Äôt really promise anything. He patched the ceiling back up and I thought it was all good.

About a month later in June ‚Äò24, I noticed that the ceiling was wet in the same place and reported it again via the tenant portal. I didn‚Äôt hear anything back so I made a third post to the tenant portal in July ‚Äò24. At this point, black mold had started to grow between the ceiling and the wall. I didn‚Äôt hear back. I went to update that same post only to find that my posts from June and July had been closed because they were ‚Äúduplicates‚Äù of the one I originally made in May. 

Between July and now (January‚Äô25) the mold has continued to grow and I even found water stains that had dripped all the way down the wall, onto the shower, and into the bathtub where it left yellow marks. Last Friday ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù came through to do an inspection of the apartments. The property manager (who is NOT the owner) told me privately that the managers doing the inspection were actually the sole owner of my building but that he likes to keep that quiet for some reason. She also told me that the reason she hadn‚Äôt replied to my maintenance requests (which she clearly had read based on our conversation) was because the building‚Äôs maintenance guy had quit back in June ‚Äò24‚Ä¶.she told me to ask the owner when I could expect to see the mold resolved. When I did, he brushed me off and didn‚Äôt give me a date or even time span. 

He and his assistant entered my apartment, asked about any issues, took pictures of the mold, peeling paint on the ceiling in my bedroom, cracked window pane, the serial numbers of the appliances etc etc. 

I know I can call the city‚Äôs non emergency line and report the issue, but hadn‚Äôt (until today) because I have quite a few small reptiles and invertebrates as well as a cat and bird that I‚Äôm definitely not meant to have and are not in my lease (I do pay pet rent, but the lease caps the number of animals at 2). I worried that if I took action and reported the issue to the city that the owner would retaliate by evicting me for violating my lease by keeping additional pets. When the owner inspected he did ask about the many terrariums and enclosures I have throughout my apartment. I answered that they were ‚Äúmostly empty‚Äù and that I build terrariums and keep tropic plants as a hobby (both true, I have loads of half finished terrariums and enclosures scattered throughout the enclosures and terrariums that actually do have animals in them). I didn't provide additional details. 

After talking it over with my partner (who lives separately) and returning from a trip over the holidays I went to bed in my apartment like usual. The bathroom with the mold is the only one in my apartment unit and is located in my bedroom. i habitually keep the door open so my cats can use the litterbox I keep in there.  This morning i woke up congested, exhausted, and short of breath. I also had a crazy amount of brainfog that I couldn‚Äôt shake despite lots of coffee and following my normal routine. I had no symptoms the previous day which I had spent snowed in at my partner‚Äôs residence. Admittedly, those symptoms are non specific, but I did some research and discovered all of them are linked to mold exposure. The kicker is that when I went onto the portal to review my lease/ check for the follow up email the owner‚Äôs assistant promised to send, I discovered that all three of my work orders regarding the mold were marked as ‚Äúclosed‚Äù despite the fact that the issue hasn‚Äôt been resolved.

I ordered a mold test kit online as well as a fungicide spray, called the city who will be sending an inspector in the next 15 days, and made a doctors appointment. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do next. I really can‚Äôt afford to move and I like my apartment and my neighbors!

It's our third voyage and I was so looking forward to our two weeks of R&R, including lovely food.  We are both fully aware that you make your own holiday on board.  Our last voyage was in March 2024.

What we didn't expect was how, even in the few short months since we last sailed, how much the food service in particular has deteriorated.  This was quite openly discussed among many passengers, including friends of ours who are Diamond level, and another who is not only a travel agent, but a former long-term Cunard staff member who sailed on QE2 for a very long time.  The on board food and beverage manager didn't seem to care  what was going on, and comments about the lack of snacks in bars (eg, there are no longer any potato chips anywhere) got a ""get over it"" response from him.

It's the little things.  Bamboo specialty dining was lovely in March.  We booked again, and were quite dismayed to see that they had removed proper chopsticks, and instead presented us with cheap bamboo disposable ones (FAIL) in paper wrappers that were too short.  Verahdah restaurant has removed the high end Laguille steak knives, and the available ones are in very poor (as in nearly blunt) condition.  We actually had to ask for them to be stropped before they would cut.

There were no coffee cups or water glasses on the tables in Lido for breakfast, as there have been in the past.  There are no spoons in the cutlery wrap in Lido. 

There's a monotonous sameness to the food in the main dining room.  Admittedly my husband is a chef and has incredibly high food standards, but there's no excuse for menus that continually use the same ingredients (eg there were mushrooms on nearly EVERY menu.)

I know this is a first world issue and I am thankful we are able to afford to cruise.  There were staff members on board, some of whom we remembered from previous  voyages, who went over and above to make our voyage comfortable.  However, some people that served us looked like they had never worked in the service industry before.  We don't expect people who are learning on the job with no instructions to be thrown into a situation that they don't know how to function in, such as a frantically busy dining room on Christmas Day.

It's toxic. I won't forgive and I can not forget. So I came here to exist in a circle jerk of similar pain. 

Ya'll, I made the mistake of reading a happy marriage post in here, and now I feel like I'm drowning. 

This.. this was my best friend?

 Folks in the shit marriages... do you ever look at your spouse and realize this stranger you're fighting, this person you've grown to hate.. that's the person you dated, fell in love with, built a life with? 

That man that I hate - he was my best friend, and that sucks. 

Dead bedroom, porn addiction, mutual abuse - all that shit. 

We would be playing minecraft in matching pajamas a few years ago. 

He called me whore and poured my coffee out. 

He cried at the end of Harry Potter. 

I haven't kissed him in a year. 

We made blown glass pumpkins together. 

I couldn't tell you where my wedding ring is. 

He held me when I cried with joy about getting into college. 

He has stayed fully silent in marriage counseling, when asked what he was willing to do to fix this. Cricket 

We did drunk ghost tours in NOL together. 

Now my bedroom is functionally dead. 

He scared the shit out of me in a confederate cemetery in Savanah while I was shitfaced. They laughed because my 5'5 self chose fight not flight. 

We haven't hugged in months. 

We listened to RHCP in Downtown LA in a rented caddy, then puked after trying sea urchin, then spent 45 minutes in line for animal style fries.

I've eaten dinner alone 2/3 of this year. 

I watched him graduate high school.  

I stopped telling him bye when he leaves for work. Hell, sometimes I don't even notice anymore. 

First kiss, first sex, all of it. 

I have called him horrendous shit to his face. 

I'm not willing to break. And neither is he. 

My marriage is failing. I'm losing my best friend. It hurts. 

And that's like crazy to me tonight. I never framed it that way. 

Neglect, executive function failure, laziness, and porn usage cost me my best friend. 

Black and white thinking, resentment, and burnout cost him his. I've resented him for years.

I stopped saying I love you too. He only said it out of reflex. Now it's just never said unless someone slips when ending a phone call. 

And like that's it. Those two people in love are just.. poof. 

Marriage counseling can't fix it. All he does is remain silent, and I cry. 

So I stopped crying, shut him out, and now... it's just gone, and that sucks. 

I'm left wondering when was the moment that got to the point of no return. 

How do you go from dancing barefoot in Chicago (middle of the street early spring fuckign cold) just to mock the notebook; to hate fucking tri-monthly and fighting Every. Bloody. Day. 

So I would come here, read, and be angry instead of hurting. And it worked. 

Then I see an actually happy marriage and I'm hurting again.

 I'm not going to get the 25 years in. A loving attentive husband. Date nights and romance. 

I'm going to be fucking single - I've never been single - that blows. 

This. Is. Bullshit.

This is a 1-2 spray max type of fragrance. It‚Äôs awesome with my skin chemistry. Lmk if you have tried it and what you think!! üñ§",7,1736314090.0,FemFragLab,1,0.89,False

What if the world was a simple place and time? Without complexity, how to make it be authentic and human and lived-in?

An example I can nominate would be The Borrowers by Mary Norton. I'm feeling nostalgic for the modest rusticity of my childhood's favourite speculative fiction.

Have any of you created such a piece of cake that would pair well with evening tea or morning coffee?

I'm yearning to create one of my own, even though my maximalist worlds-within-worlds is very much themed around idyllic quaintness, it also comes with the solemnity of a greatness beyond comprehension.

1hwce10,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1hwce10/preinfusion_bloom_in_mokapot/,Pre-infusion /bloom in mokapot,"So, someone in reddit posted about using their mokapot funnel for pour over brew.
I mean they just put coffee grounds in the funnel, poured hot water with the collection chamber and made coffee, 

While I'm not really enthusiastic about that... 
It got me thinking.. 

Mokapot is also percolation brewer. 
We have Bloom in pour over and we have pre-infusion in espresso. But mokapot does not have pre-infusion / Blooming phase. 

I don't know much about coffee, but someone who knows their coffee essentially explained me science of Blooming and pre-infusion. 

So essentially it's to saturate the coffee grounds with water evenly, and for degassing.

I just wondered, 
If one wets the coffee grounds in the funnel with room temperature water before brewing with it. 
May be certain things can happen. 

We are saturating the coffee grounds and degassing it.
But we may also be able to get rid of super fines which makes the coffee bitter.

While in espresso the pressure is quite a lot, the temperature of water is essentially around 95 degrees Celsius, right? 

But in mokapot, even with 2 bars of pressure, the water can get quite hot, as the pressure increases, the boiling point of water also increases, 
And at 2 bar of pressure the boiling point can be around 120 degrees Celsius.

Granted our liquid water might be below 120 but it can still be around 110 degrees Celsius when it touches the coffee grounds. 

I feel like that's too much of a temperature for coffee which is grounded finer than pour over.
And mostly we also use medium roasted and dark roast coffees in mokapot, as generally mokapots are not the best brewers for light roasted coffees.

So, what if the coffee grounds are saturated with room temperature water? Then at the time of the contact with hot water, the brewing temperature can get lower and might help in over extraction.

I think the ratio will be quite skewed and I don't know how to deal with that as coffee will absorb the water. And I will also loose some good solubles during the Blooming phase and that seems wasteful.

But I want to know someone's thoughts about this who knows more about coffee and science than me. 

Is this worth even trying? Or I'm just doing mental gymnastics for nothing.",1,1736313911.0,JamesHoffmann,0,0.67,False
1hwcdjp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hwcdjp,Cool Starbucks Locations Around the World ,"Hey everyone! 

As someone who‚Äôs trying spent 4.5 years and became a store manager at Starbucks, here are some cool locations I have been to and share coffee with friends and family. 


I‚Äôve seen a lot of news about Starbucks recently in the past 5 years or so, Partners and barista unionizing, quitting and leaving the company. Starbucks has raised pay to $25.50-$29 an hour in California for shift supervisors and I know many partners have mixed feelings about the company and the direction of the company. I never had a bad experience as a store manager or as a barista from my upper management, especially the district manager or regional director. 

As someone who loves the brand. Can supervisors (or Baristas) or store manager can share their experiences about the company now in the last few years? 

How‚Äôs the district manager treating the store  manager in your district?  How‚Äôs the staffing at your store? 

How‚Äôs the workload and expectations as a store manager? 

Do you think you‚Äôre compensated well for your role, as a barista or a manager? 

Have you debated about leaving?

1hwccwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPA/comments/1hwccwh/cpa_fan_story_chatgtp/,CPA Fan Story (ChatGTP),"Title: RedStapler4‚Äôs Journey to CPA and Beyond

The soft glow of the bedside lamp flickered on as RedStapler4 climbed out of bed, the house still wrapped in quiet. SexyMan was already up, sipping coffee in the living room, but RedStapler4 had one thing on her mind‚Äîstudying.

She slipped into her comfiest pair of jeans, the ones worn just right, and pulled on her oversized green sweatshirt. It wasn‚Äôt fancy, but it was warm and familiar. Somehow, wearing it made the long hours feel less daunting.

By the time she made her way to the kitchen table, the sun was barely peeking through the curtains. SexyMan wandered in, his hair delightfully messy and his grin as charming as always.

‚ÄúBack at it already?‚Äù he teased, leaning against the counter.

RedStapler4 smirked as she opened her laptop and study guide. ‚ÄúIf I stop now, I might forget everything I crammed in last night.‚Äù

SexyMan chuckled and walked over, pressing a kiss to the top of her head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think forgetting is in your DNA.‚Äù

The Daily Grind

Days blurred into a steady rhythm‚Äî40 hours of work, evenings spent buried in her laptop and study guide, and weekends dedicated to practice exams. The green sweatshirt became her uniform, worn so often that SexyMan started calling it her ‚ÄúCPA armor.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre basically a superhero,‚Äù he joked one evening as she sat cross-legged on the floor, swiping through digital flashcards. ‚ÄúBut even superheroes need to rest.‚Äù

RedStapler4 leaned back against the couch, tossing a pillow at him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll rest when I pass FAR.‚Äù

SexyMan caught the pillow with ease and grinned. ‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù

The Exam Days

On the morning of her first exam, RedStapler4 woke up early, slipping into the same jeans and green sweatshirt she had studied in for months. It felt like luck‚Äîlike she was carrying all those hours of hard work with her.

SexyMan made her coffee and walked her to the door. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got this,‚Äù he said, giving her hand a reassuring squeeze.

Each exam day played out the same. Same jeans. Same sweatshirt. Same quiet confidence that grew stronger with every test.

She tackled FAR first, the beast of them all. Then came REG, where she practically dreamed of tax codes. TCP challenged her in ways she didn‚Äôt expect, but she powered through. Finally, AUD‚Äîthe last hurdle‚Äîstood no chance against her determination.

Victory After Victory

When the first score release came, RedStapler4 hovered over her laptop, too nervous to check.

SexyMan sat down beside her, resting his chin on her shoulder. ‚ÄúReady?‚Äù

She exhaled and tapped the screen. Congratulations, you passed FAR.

She blinked in disbelief. ‚ÄúI did it‚Ä¶‚Äù

SexyMan pulled her into a tight hug. ‚ÄúI knew it.‚Äù

One by one, the exams fell into place. Each passing score felt like another brick in the foundation she was building‚Äîstrong, steady, unshakable.

The day she passed the final exam, SexyMan greeted her at the door with takeout and a bottle of champagne.

‚ÄúTo the woman who doesn‚Äôt know the meaning of giving up,‚Äù he said, raising his glass.

The Reward

Soon after, RedStapler4‚Äôs boss called her into the office, offering her a raise that bumped her salary to six figures. But even with the promotion, she couldn‚Äôt shake the desire to build something of her own.

She launched a small consulting business on the side, turning her home office into a place where ideas thrived. SexyMan helped set up the desk, hanging shelves and organizing files.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to need a vacation after this,‚Äù SexyMan said, admiring the space.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right,‚Äù RedStapler4 replied, leaning against him. ‚ÄúHow about Europe?‚Äù

The Celebration

Paris, Rome, and Santorini filled their days with laughter and adventure. In the evenings, they watched sunsets and toasted to the journey that had led them there.

One night, on a rooftop in Santorini, RedStapler4 snuggled into SexyMan‚Äôs side, feeling the breeze and the warmth of his arm around her.

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt have done any of this without you,‚Äù she whispered.

SexyMan kissed her forehead, smiling softly. ‚ÄúYou could have. But I‚Äôm glad I got to be part of it.‚Äù

She smiled, eyes drifting toward the horizon. The green sweatshirt was packed in her suitcase back at the hotel‚Äîjust in case she ever needed it again.

I know it's making my anxiety, mood, irritability and sleep 100% worse but I cannot stop.  It's my only comfort or thing I look forward to for some odd reason.  It makes me feel worse but it somehow masks my depression which is also very bad.

**Finances**

Financially I would say 2024 was neutral. Total corpus grew by about 8%. It is still above the EOY 2024 target.

I would mention few highlights on the financial/RE Planning front:

1. The portfolio is now in auto-pilot mode as per my bucket strategy. I can choose to leave it as it is and look once every 6 months. In fact, last week I looked at it after 3 months for my end of year review. However, as I noted last year, it is equity heavy. There are days when I lean towards moving some amount to debt. Then on other days, I want to leave it as it is. As of now, the cash and debt buckets are adequately funded as per plan ([https://www.reddit.com/r/FIREIndia/comments/p87g0b/bucket\_strategy\_advice/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIREIndia/comments/p87g0b/bucket_strategy_advice/))
2. My elder kid went off to medical college and to hostel. So those expenses are no longer counted in my RE budget. I had set aside a separate corpus for my kids' education. All elder kid's expenses are coming from that budget. Day to day expenses like electricity, food etc are also nudging down as there is one less member at home. 
3. Travel expenses went down significantly. There was no international travel and only one family trip. Rest of my trips were solo.  Overall travel actually went up, including a three and a half week long bike trip. 
4. We made a conscious choice to reduce wasteful expenses, healthier lifestyle¬†and reduce eating out. This has a direct effect on the annual expenses.¬†
5. We gave more to charitable causes. Something I feel good about.¬†

Owning to above factors, expenses reduced by 1/3rd i.e. we spent on 2/3rd of the amount we spent last year.¬†

Here‚Äôs major categories where we spent as a percent of total expense. Everything else individually was less than 5% of total. I have purposefully not mentioned the exact amount as everyone has a different lifestyle and need to spend accordingly. 

* Travel -¬†5%¬†
* Education - 12%¬†
* Food & Household Consumables - 18%¬†
* House Maintenance & Capital Expenditure - 12%¬†
* Maid/Cook/Other Helpers - 10%¬†
* Charity - 12%¬†
* Everything else: 21% 

**How I spend my day**

My daily routine hasn‚Äôt changed much from last year.

Our dog left for happy hunting grounds. She was good company for 11+yrs. The morning walks are later and longer now.¬†

I am no longer teaching math at the nearby school (more down below).  So, I am spending a little more time reading and sleeping. 

* Wake up around 5:30am. Go for a walk from 6 to 7.¬†
* Morning coffee along with seeing my kid off on the school bus.¬†
* Breakfast at 8am while my wife has tea.
* 9am till lunch reading, web surfing and other small activities.¬†
* Lunch by 1pm, Then catch a nap or just relax.¬†
* 3pm - chores, walk nearby to shop etc.
* 4-5pm - hang around with my kid.
* 5:30pm - Walk around the complex. Talk to people and yoga thrice a week.
* After 7:30pm - A mix time for hobbies (woodworking these days) or teaching my kid if needed.¬†
* 9pm dinner with family followed by online or reading.
* 10:30 - Sleep.



**Teaching**

I was taking extra math classes for free in a nearby school in exchange for providing free education to two students. One of my students topped the school math score in CBSE 2024. An extremely proud moment for me.¬†

Unfortunately, the math teachers at the school felt threatened and got jealous. I could see there was significant friction in the faculty because of my presence.¬†

I also felt guilty when I went on my extended travels missing the classes.¬†

As a result, I have stopped teaching at the school. I still support a couple of the students when they need help before the exams.¬†

**Travel**

Another great year for travel. Three long motorbike rides - one to Goa, one to Kaas plateau and a mega ride from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, weeklong solo backpacking trips to Gujarat and Himachal and a family road trip to Southern Karnataka coastline.¬†

One of the big benefits of not working is I can take off anytime without worrying about work commitments. For planning a trip with family, I just have to consider school vacations.¬†

On two of the trips, I did some volunteer teaching to school kids in remote places. A very fulfilling time spent in those villages.¬†

**Health**

There was a renewed focus on health this year. I am walking longer in the mornings, went on several small hikes around the city and am watching what I eat. I am also sleeping longer. 

I lost 5Kg and my systolic BP is consistently 10 points lower than before when I was working. Hoping to lose another 5 Km this year.¬†

**Other Thoughts**  
I read quite a lot more this year and reduced the time I spend on the computer/phone. It has a very positive effect on my mind. 

After a few years of settling down, I have put all systems of day-to-day life on auto pilot. So, most days are spent on enjoying the extra time I have. The only break is when I travel, which is quite often.¬†

As they say, boring is good.

Like many people in this sub, I fell in love with specialty coffee almost 10 years ago and have dedicated much of my time to not only improving how I brew coffee, but also learning about producers, roasters, and the entire value chain. I had the opportunity to travel to Japan and visited several specialty coffee shops in various cities where I got to speak to world class baristas who have participated in competitions and dedicated their time to refining their craft. Throughout my trip, I learned a lot and thought it would be helpful to share some of that with you all, including specific recipes, grind sizes, and recommendations directly from the baristas I spoke with!

As with anything related to coffee, there is no one size fits all solution to get you that perfect cup, and the things I share here may not work for you! In fact, I have my own personal qualms with some of the things they shared, but I‚Äôll hold my opinions from this post and include them in the comments. My intention is not to give you a silver bullet solution, but rather to facilitate the open source of information that I received from experts. Enjoy!

While there were many places I visited, there were four locations where I spent the most time speaking to baristas and asking for recommendations:

**AITA for declining to celebrate Christmas with my boyfriend‚Äôs family and not inviting him to my family‚Äôs celebration?**

**Trigger Warnings:** >!manipulation, racism, controlling behavior, misogyny!<

-------------------

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/ARtLgrjvpU): **December 24, 2024**

For context, I (19F) am from the United States and currently a second-year university student in the UK. My boyfriend (23M) is British, recently finished his master‚Äôs, and is now working. We‚Äôve been dating for 10 months, and he‚Äôs my first boyfriend. He‚Äôs been nothing but understanding, kind, and supportive throughout our relationship. I‚Äôve met his parents and siblings twice, and both times were wonderful. His mom even told him she thinks I‚Äôm ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù

In late November, he asked if I‚Äôd like to spend Christmas with his family. He said everyone would love to have me there, and I thought it was sweet, but I declined. I‚Äôve been feeling homesick and wanted to spend Christmas, a holiday that means a lot to me, with my family in South Dakota. When I told him, he seemed aloof for a few days. I went to his flat later to reassure him that I‚Äôd love to visit his family another time, but for me, Christmas is a family holiday. I now realize how that could‚Äôve sounded dismissive. He looked hurt and asked, ‚ÄúDo you still love me?‚Äù and ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt I your family?‚Äù I reassured him that I do love him, and things seemed fine after that.

About a week later, he surprised me by showing me a flight he‚Äôd booked to South Dakota for Christmas. Flights to South Dakota are expensive, especially internationally, and while the gesture was touching, I thought it was impulsive and unwise. I told him it wasn‚Äôt a good idea. For the first time, he got really upset, accusing me of not caring about him, not being serious about us, and thinking only of myself‚Äîall of which are untrue. I love him and value our relationship deeply. Knowing he was speaking out of hurt, I asked him to take a walk to cool off.

When he returned, I explained that he means everything to me, but I wasn‚Äôt ready for him to meet my family. To be honest, I‚Äôm nervous about how my family would react. I‚Äôm white, he‚Äôs Arab, and my family in rural South Dakota is not exposed to diversity. They‚Äôve made ignorant, racist comments in the past. While they‚Äôd likely be polite to his face, I fear they might say something offensive or ‚Äújokingly‚Äù inappropriate. They also assume Arab = Muslim, even though he‚Äôs Christian. This ignorance embarrasses me, and I don‚Äôt want to put him in a situation where he might be hurt.

I didn‚Äôt tell him any of this, though. Instead, I said I felt it was too soon to ‚Äúbring someone home,‚Äù as in my family, that‚Äôs often a precursor to engagement (which is true). He asked if he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúgood enough,‚Äù and I reassured him that he‚Äôs perfect.

He then mentioned that the tickets were non-refundable. I started crying, apologizing for wasting his money and saying how much I wanted him there, just not right now. He asked me to leave and said he needed space. I flew back home nearly a week ago, and since then, we‚Äôve only had brief phone conversations. He still texts me ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and ‚ÄúGood night,‚Äù but he‚Äôs clearly distant and hurt. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs anything I can do to fix this or reassure him.

So, AITA?

**Verdict: Asshole**

**Editor‚Äôs Note: OOP received mixed reactions of YTAs and NTAs. YTA was based on the details where OOP was not clearing up regarding racism issues from her family and their background. NTA was for what OOP did as her relationship isn‚Äôt even a year yet**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** YTA. Your family is pretty racist and you might as well tell him that now. There reaction is going to be the same if you brought him there now or 5 years from now. Your intent is selfish in nature. You‚Äôre not protecting him. You‚Äôre protecting yourself from the criticism you‚Äôre going to get. He‚Äôs hurt now, wait till he meets your parents and realized you kept such a massive thing a secret.

> **OOP:** My immediate family (mom, dad, and sister) are very open and totally fine with me dating him. It‚Äôs my extended family - grandma, aunts, uncles, and cousins I am extremely worried about.

**Commenter 2:** No one is an asshole imo but you‚Äôve both made big errors. Buying a nonrefundable international flight without telling you is very unwise, like you said. But you‚Äôre not being a good partner by hiding the truth about your family from him. You‚Äôre 19 so I‚Äôm not gonna say YTA but this is an asshole move. He deserves to know your true motivations, I‚Äôm sure he would understand if you just explained it kindly- nearly everyone has experiences with ignorant family. Did you even tell your family about where he‚Äôs from though?

> **OOP:** My entire family knows his race. My immediate family (parents and sister) are in full support and it doesn‚Äôt bother them at all. My extended family (grandma, aunts, uncles and cousins) have already made racist remarks about him, most of them they tried to pass off as ‚Äújokes‚Äù

**Commenter 3:** Do you push back against that?

Have you made it clear to them that this is SERIOUS, and they need to cut it out?

Unless you're planning to go low contact with your family and live in the UK full time, this isn't going to end well... trying to just push the meeting off into the future...

> **OOP:** My bf and I want to live together in the UK once I graduate. My family doesn‚Äôt know this yet, and I think this would be another reason to get mad at him (they were already livid about me going to another country for uni).
> 
> As for their racism, I have told them I didn‚Äôt appreciate it, but most of the comments I have heard through my sister after they happened.

**Commenter 4:** Bold of him to book non-refundable plane tickets without talking to you. Pretty huge red flag, tbh.

You've been together 10 months, he needs to chill the fuck out. This seems controlling and clingy.

When you get back you need to be honest with him that you weren't sure your family would behave, and ALSO that you felt him buying tickets was presumptive and moving too fast. You're 19. You don't need to rush things and he needs to respect your boundaries.

> **OOP:** Thank you so much! This was really helpful üôè

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/vyVs56O5gf): **December 26, 2024 (two days later)** 

My boyfriend (23M) and I (19F) have been dating for 10 months now. He‚Äôs from the UK where I study at university, and I am currently back in the USA for winter break. I made a horrible mistake about how I handled his invitation to Christmas and refusing to let him come to mine (in another reddit post of mine).

Yesterday, I decided to call him and try to fix things, since what I did was so wrong. I explained my family‚Äôs issues with racism (he‚Äôs Jordanian and I‚Äôm white), and how I was wanting to protect him and trying to handle my family‚Äôs problems before he gets introduced. I acknowledged that I should‚Äôve told him, and handed it poorly, but would be honest with him from now on. I also told him that I had a conversation with my family about my relationship, and told them any racist behavior from their end would be completely unacceptable.

Initially, he was understanding of my situation. He said my family didn‚Äôt change the way he felt or viewed me, he was glad I was honest, and he apologized for his reactions earlier.

After a while, he said that after what happened, we should lay some ground rules for each person in our relationship. I thought it was going to be things like honesty, trust, consideration etc. Instead he literally gave me things I must do in order for this relationship to be ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù.

Firstly, he told me I couldn‚Äôt make decisions about things without him first. He basically said that relationships require sacrifice and compromise, and with big things such as Christmas, vacations, etc. I would need him to be ok with me doing these things. He said it was childish of me to be in the habit of ‚Äúdoing whatever I want.‚Äù Secondly, he told me I should distance myself from my family. I actually understand his reasoning here, considering how some of them are racist and not great people. I told him it was complicated, because I still loved them despite this (which might make me just as bad?? not sure). I can still see where he was coming from, so I told him that if they ever made a racist comment about anyone in front of me, I would try to educate and if that didn‚Äôt work, I would distance myself. He then said I was playing middleman, and that was unfair to him. He said in a few years when we get married, I would have to make the choice. He finally told me he wants my location on at all times, and wants me to go low contact with my male friends, most of which are gay anyways.

I told him lot of these rules seemed over the top, and in the most patronizing tone, he said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never been in a relationship before and I‚Äôm older than you, so you should listen.‚Äù The moment he said that I thought it didn‚Äôt sound like him at all. Most of the time he is the most easy-going and relaxed person, so I couldn‚Äôt believe it.

I told him I didn‚Äôt appreciate being talked to like a child, and if he wanted to be someone‚Äôs father, then he should look for another person. He said that while he still forgave me for what I did earlier, my behavior was a testament to how immature I am. He then said we would continue this conversation another time and hung up, before we could even say goodbye.

I feel like I partially caused this shift in his behavior by inadvertently making him insecure because of my refusal to let him come. Before this, he was honestly the last person I would ever consider getting insecure. He is very good-looking, has a good career, and has always been confident so I would never think he would act this way. It breaks my heart to know that I caused his actions, and want to know how I can convince him to let go of the rules so things can go back to the way they were? Or AITA for declining to follow the rules and should I just follow them?

Edit: I‚Äôve been in this relationship for 10 months and really do love him. I told my friends the things he said and they‚Äôve reiterated the points made here, but I guess it‚Äôs hard for me to wrap my head around how he could go from such a good guy to this. I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm going to do yet, but please be mindful that it‚Äôs a lot more difficult for me to look at this objectively.

Second edit: I appreciate everyone‚Äôs comments and support. I have read every single comment and have thought about my relationship all afternoon. I cried when I realized I must end things. I will be calling/texting him tomorrow morning and breaking up.

**Relevant Comments**

**What is OOP‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs religion and his family‚Äôs background in UK**

> **OOP:** He‚Äôs not Muslim, but Christian, and his family has lived in the UK for 3 generations.

**Commenter 1:** OP, I'm gonna be brutally honest here, even if I get down-voted to hell. Keep in mind I've read your first post:

1- he comes from a misogynistic culture, even if he's not Muslim. And it's showing. Why?

a- he got angry cause you chose your birth family for Christmas, even though you guys haven't been together not even for 1 year.

b- he inserted himself in your holidays with those tickets he bought. That was controlling and intrusive, NOT caring.

c- now, just because you didn't really told him why you didn't want him there (to not hurt him) he's taking that as a green flag to call you ""immature"" and assume an even MORE controlling stance.

d- he's already used manipulation: ""Don't you love me?"".

2- There's plenty of suffering in your future if you remain with this guy. This has only just begun.

Leave him and spare yourself, or regret it later. The choice is yours.

> **OOP:** Thank you. I have really absorbed everything you said (and what others have said) and am going to break things off. I am not sure if I should until I am back so it‚Äôs in person or if I should just do it over the phone. It feels mean to just break up over the phone, and since our relationship is long term, shouldn‚Äôt I just do it when I get back?

**Does OOP live with her BF? And what do her friends think of the relationship altogether?**

> **OOP:** We don‚Äôt live with each other, sometimes I stay over at his flat but I live in my uni accom.
> 
> My friends (in the UK) really like him. We‚Äôve been to the pub together as a huge group and it‚Äôs always been a lot of fun. He‚Äôs very kind and funny, so they‚Äôve never had issues with him. My friends in the US didn‚Äôt mind him until this entire thing happened. Since they never met him in person I would send photos of us and ss‚Äôs of our texts and they all would say how in love we looked.
> 
> Before this, he was legitimately perfect. I met him in my university‚Äôs cafe where he bought me coffee and chatted me up. He was so charismatic and made me feel so special, always remembering little details and giving me random surprise gifts. He seriously has never been this uptight before. The only thing he did was express concern over a few of my male friends, but I assured him they were gay/or they didn‚Äôt have feelings for me and he let it go.

**Commenter 2:** OP this is classic controlling behavior - he is trying to isolate you from your family (I haven't read your other post yet, but it looks like they are inadvertently giving him the right tools to do so), from your friends and basically everything that would provide you a place of refuge and shelter if you ever have to leave him.

This whole ""I am older, so you must listen"" would not fly even if he was ten years older, but he is fucking 23... that is four years older than you, he still is a fucking immature child (maybe not legally, but certainly from the way he acts).

What are the rules for him? What are the sacrifices he makes? Right now all I can see is him trying to basically make all decisions for you and make him totally dependent on you, while he gives up nothing.

NTA - and when you go back to the UK politely tell him to fuck the hell off.

**Commenter 3:** Op, you didn't cause him to be like this. It was already there and he latched onto the first mistake you made to show his true colors.

He's using your guilt to manipulate you and control you and make it your fault.

This was always what was going to happen. Nothing you did or didn't do was going to prevent it.

You're 19, you just got done being a child who had to listen to their parents. This is the time for you to make your own decisions, be independent and ya.. do what you want (within reason obvs). Don't stay in this relationship. Its not going to end well for you if he's already this controlling after 10 months.

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hnjwbo/update_aita_for_refusing_to_follow_the_rules_my/): **December 27, 2024** 

Hey everyone, I wanted to update on my previous two posts. I received great advice from a lot of people and it immensely helped me trying it evaluate our relationship. I texted my friends about the situation, and they also agreed he sounded overbearing. About an hour ago, I ended things for good.

I texted him yesterday afternoon that I thought we should have a serious discussion about our relationship. He said we should wait until we have both cooled off from our conversations earlier, so I suggested tomorrow. He sent me his usual good night and I love you texts, which kinda broke me. His horrible behavior didn‚Äôt erase 10 months of love that I feel for him, and it almost felt like betraying him saying the same things back when I knew what I was going to do in the morning.

Here‚Äôs kinda a summarized version of the call (It was over an hour so I condensed it as much as I could and I tried to write it as quickly as the call ended so I wouldn‚Äôt forget)

Anyways, when I called him, he seemed very normal and calm. We talked for 10 minutes just about how things were going and stuff. Then I basically told him that I didn‚Äôt want to do this, but I thought it would be best if we broke up. I said that we probably expected different things from our partners, and I couldn‚Äôt do what he wanted from me.

After I said that, he sat in silence for like a minute. I thought the call had dropped, but then he said he was processing what I said. He asked me if this was revenge for what he said two days ago, and I said no, just a realization of incompatibility. He then said he wasn‚Äôt going to change his mind on his boundaries, and me giving him an ultimatum was manipulative. I told him that this wasn‚Äôt an ultimatum, it was going to happen.

He then kept repeating ‚ÄúWhat the fuck [my name]?‚Äù and then told me I didn‚Äôt mean it. He asked me if I loved him still, and I said yes, and then he said he knows I‚Äôll come back. I said this was it. He said something about how we need each other and went on a rant, but I don‚Äôt remember that much of it because I was crying at that point.

I cut him off at the end, and just said goodbye. He said he would never forgive me and I would never see him again since ‚Äúhe was that awful‚Äù and then hung up. I immediately blocked his number, whatsapp, snopchat and insta. I do not think he will have another way of contacting me.

I do not think he will seek me out or anything, so im not too worried about that. My university accommodation also has front desk security and you can‚Äôt get in without a keycard. Thanks again everyone.

Edit: His mom just texted me saying she was sad things ended the way they did, but she wishes me all the best.

Minor update: One of his friends tried adding me on snapchat for some reason. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs him using his friend‚Äôs account, his friend wants to know what happened, or a coincidence he added me right when this unfolded.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA - you did the right thing

When you get back make sure to inform campus accommodations that this person is not allowed to contact you or visit you or anything. He also might try to see you in the buildings where you have your lectures (if those are accessible) or places where you shop or like to eat.

For the next few weeks see if you can mostly socialize in groups and with friends, avoid being alone.

> **OOP:** Thank you. Most of the buildings require an ID to get into!

**Commenter 2:** NTA

please please please be careful when you return to the UK.  Get help to watch your back!!!!

He is NOT done and he does NOT accept this is over.  He sees you as the dumb immature inexperienced girl he can mold and control the way he wants.  No way will he give this up easily without fighting.

> **OOP:** Thanks for your advice. I have talked to a lot of my friends in the UK and I am going to stay close them for awhile when I get back.

**Commenter 3:** NTA. Setting boundaries and then actually enforcing them is an important life skill.

I had a dream that I was standing on the other side of my coffee table looking at my sleeping self on the couch where I was actually sleeping. 

Then a ton of little red and black long legged spiders started crawling all over my sleeping self and then in the next instant I was back as myself ""waking up"" to these spiders crawling all over me. 

There were so many I could hear their little footsteps on my blanket.

[Original Post - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/j2v4dw/my_21f_boyfriend_22m_gets_so_jealous_over_his/)  **Sept 30, 2020**

My boyfriend (Jake) and I are high school sweethearts and share an apartment with his brother, Finn.

Finn has been seeing a woman named Bonnie for the past three months. They met over Tinder and with certain restrictions lifting, wer'e finally getting to spend time with her IRL. She's a really great person and she and Finn are stupidly into each other. Like, accidentally finishing each other's sentences in love, staring at each other with big gooey eyes in love. Its kinda gross but kinda sweet.

A couple of days ago I noticed that Jake's been acting weird. He's been a lot quieter and a bit colder to me, going to bed early, getting up late. I tried to kiss him and he turned away. Yesterday when Finn was out, I asked what was up with him. He started off kinda hostile but when I said that I was really feeling hurt, he blew up.

Summarized, he told me that he was rethinking our entire relationship after listening to his brother talk about Bonnie. He said that Bonnie asked for Finn's preference when she cut her hair and didn't get bangs when he said he thought they looked stupid when I got a pixie without asking Jake what he'd think first. He said that Bonnie gave Finn a blow job every night before bed and one every morning when he woke up, when I don't really like oral (giving or receiving). He said I never offer to give him massages or pack his lunch.

For clarification, I do things for him all the time, but we've NEVER been lovey dovey: we don't even celebrate valentines day (his suggestion) We both always agreed it was stupid and unrealistic. In fact, we always used to make fun of people for being sappy and definitely gave Finn hell for a bit over being so gooey.

He was crying by the end of it, saying that he felt sick over missing out on someone who would love him that much. I said I loved him, but he didn't wanna hear it. He started gagging and threw up a little bit because he was crying so hard. I didn't know what else to do so I got him some water and went to bed.

I went to work early and I've been hanging out at a coffee shop but I have to go home soon. I have no idea where to go from here or what to say to him. I don't even know if were still together. Help? Just. With all of this shit.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/tAAdaRyOAs)  **Oct 3, 2020 (3 days later)**

Sorry I didn't respond to anyone's comments I went home after posting and by the time I logged back on to reddit the post had been locked. A few of you asked for the update so here it is. 

I'm single.

I came home and Jake was gone. Finn was there and asked if I could sit down for a bit. He wouldn't give me the exactly details but said that he and Jake had 'talked' while I was out. He also showed me a few text messages to prove it. 

Apparently, Finn had never shared any details with his brother, but Jake had been able to hear them moan through the walls when Bonnie stayed over. 

It wasn't a bro talk or anything after all. Just the man I thought was gonna marry listening to his brother have sex through the walls. Neat. 

When Finn got home from work, Jake tried joking about it and made comments about Bonnie's race. Finn kicked him out and now Jake is gonna be staying with their parents so I have to pay his share of the rent too because Finn refuses to let him in and Jake refuses to come back. Double neat. 

A few people had questions so here we go:

Did Jake ever mention wanting romantic gestures? No. We actually got together because we were the only goths in school. We bonded over being against lovey dovey stuff like that. We grew out of the edgy phase but yeah. He always was firm he hated valentines day and women who needed roses or gifts to feel loved. 

Has he ever done anything like this before? Now that I think about it, yeah. He's thrown tantrums before but never like this. Things like carry out orders forgetting his side dishes or stores running out of his favorite items always made him really emotional. 

Why don't you like oral: bad incident involving Jake's braces left me with some scarring down there. He liked deepthroating. 0/10

I feel sorry for Bonnie: I don't want to know any more details about their relationship but they seem happy. They work at the same high intensity job (think physical trainers or OT) so she packs meal prepped bento boxes for him and herself. Finn buys her flowers, fixes her car, goes over when spiders get into her apartment. Like I said, they're cute. 

This is fake: listen man thats your right to believe it. Even i think its fake and im the one that has to figure out how to ship 200 funko pops to my ex. 

So there you go.

>Nope, his brother can figure that shit out. That dude is no longer your responsibility. 

>You also don't have to pay double rent. Jake can pay rent for a place he doesn't live in. 

>You need to find a new place to live. So you don't have to be surrounded by a reminder of your past relationship.

1hwby1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReddXReads/comments/1hwby1a/tales_of_community_college_the_one_who_has_it_bad/,Tales of Community College: The One Who has it Bad (part 9) ,"Hello once again Reddx and readers, I'm back with another tale and tell you all that we're almost half way to the end. where we left off is Bestbro wanting to meet up and wanting to talk about Artlad. This tale however is also where I talk to Sourface and keep in mind, I haven't seen nor talked to him since he saw me with his brother Goodfella. I know this saga is a slow burn but remember, this all happened within a month. The community college I went to have their semesters only four months long so I ""spent a quarter"" of that in stupid drama. Not only that, I was starting to rethink my friendship with Artlad and wanted to spend more time with Goodfella (I have tales about this guy but not important to this saga). Again sorry about my writing, being bilingual is hard.

**CHOOSE YOUR CHARACTER!**

**Dizzy:** The 19 year old who's plotting to mess with both Queenie's and Sourface's......uhh love life I guess. Also falling into a hole that could cause the biggest fall out I've ever had.

**Goodfella:** The 18 year old brother of an cousin lovin' dude who basically I've never seen him smile genuinely. He's more of a ""friend"" then Artlad and was always there if I needed him.

**Sourface:** A mean girl who's cursed to be trapped in a 21 year old fat man's body who never smiles. Also took the sweet home Alabama stereotype and went ""huh, that's not a bad idea. I could give Queenie a pity fuck because I'm an nice alpha"". He really hates and I do mean REALLY hates Goodfella for some reason.

**Bestbro:** The 19 year old best friend of Artlad. He's also a good friend of mine and will hold anyone accountable of their wrong doing. Right now however he need a pal to vent.

**Bestgal:** The 19 year old girlfriend of Bestbro. Her appearance is brief since she's very busy with her own school work. She came along cuz  I need a neutral party. 

**Cherry:** The 22 year old plus sized pin-up chick who's basically running the actual club and done with Queenie's crap. She's in the story briefly.

**Artlad:** 19 years old and the one who put me into this mess in first place. Will this tale be the one to break of this friendship? Who knows?

**LETS GET READY FOR THIS TALE!**

So the last time, Bestbro was asking me if I wanted meet up with him so he tell me everything about Artlad's home life. I did want Bestbro telling since it's Artlad's story to tell. However, Bestbro got into argument with him and seem to want to hurt him in the same way Artlad hurt me. I was staring at my phone and Bestbro was waiting for my answer t the other end of the line. I didn't want to be at Artlad's level by doing that but Bestbro was waiting so with a deep breath and said:

**Me: Ok Bestbro, I'll meet up with you.**

**Bestbro: Good.**

**Me: But not without your girlfriend. I need a neural party there.**

**Bestbro: Ok sure, I'm free later this week after classes are over. What time is best for you?**

And with that we set up a time. I feel gross remembering this and typing it cuz I did stoop down to Artlad's level all because I wanted to know thinking that I ""needed to know"". In my journal, I wrote ""If it wasn't for Artlad's drama, I won't feel the need to hurt him or at less wanting to make him feel so sorry. It feels like Artlad doesn't want me or Bestbro be friends anymore. Yet wants us to fix he's drama with Queenie."" after that phone call, I felt numb. I was so numb that I started to rethink what's the point to help Goodfella, what's the point to ""fix"" my friendship with Artlad, what's the point to do any of this. Yet I continued. I continued because I think a part of me just wanted to hurt Artlad or Queenie or Sourface because I was hurt. Hurt people hurt other people you know. Before I could rethink thoroughly, I got a text from Goodfella saying what are we going to do with Sourface. That got me out of the haze. However, I wasn't in the mood to talk so I told him we could talk tomorrow. Remembering all of this really made feel dumb cuz this is really immature. As I lay there, staring at the ceiling, I realize I needed to set-up an appointment with my doctor cuz I wasn't doing well (more on that later).

I fell asleep and woke up to a text from Bestgal. I felt I barely slept a wink but after checking that is already morning I felt like that day was not going to be easy. Again this was years ago so this conversion isn't 100% word for word but it kinds went like:

**Bestgal: Hey Dizzy, Bestbro told me you wanted a neural party in this meet up?**

**Me: Hey Bestgal, yes I wanted someone ease the tension of this drama. You're the only one I could think of. I'm not being to pushy am I?**

**Bestgal: No! Not at all, Bestbro isn't really giving me the full story since he's busy dealing with Artlad. But I wanted to ask you something.**

**Me: Go ahead.**

**Bestgal: You really don't know much about his home life? like we been friends since freshmen year of high school and it wasn't brought up?**

**Me: I mean I did told my story but he didn't say much but he did slip some here and there.**

**Bestgal: Huh? weird. I'll talk more when we meet up. See you soon.**

**Me: 'Kay**

I also kinda remembered not wanted to go to class that day and my body felt that heaviness where you're just done with everything. But I still got dressed and headed out and put on a ""mask"" so people wouldn't think anything was up. Like always I meet up with Goodfella.

**Goodfella: Woah, you look like shit. What gives.**

**Me: I look like shit because I'm in drama that a ""good friend"" put me into. You know the reason I played along to your plans.**

**Goodfella: Well shit dude, how's us fucking with my cousin and brother leaving you drained?**

**Me: Man, I don't know dude, all I know is I want get this over with so I don't have think about ever again. So what the hell is the next step.**

**Goodfella: I'm glad you ask. Did you get my text last night?**

**Me: about you asking what we doing about Sourface? Yeah, why?**

**Goodfella: I got an idea. The thing is, it's was pretty obvious that you and I are talking to each so he cornered me about it.**

**Me: And? Why does he care? I'm not even his type. Plus I cried pretty hard the day where he followed me to every class.**

he took a deep breath look at me with ""I know you're going to hate me but,"" kind of look.

**Goodfella: Remember we talked about using your ""girl hormones"".**

**Me: Yeah but what hav...**(thought about it for a monment) **WAIT WHAT ALREADY? DUDE I'M NOT READY TO FACE HIM!**

**Goodfella: Don't yell! Look I know this is bullshit but we need to do this.**

**Me: Look Dude, I'm starting to think this getting kinda stupid. Can't we just stop at giving Queenie that stupid list of ""traits"" and just wait for Sourface and Queenie to do their thing.**

**Goodfella: Do you really think that's going work?**

**Me: Come on dude be real here. This isn't even a big campus so of course someone that one of us knows will catch on and not only that, how far are we realistically are we going to push Queenie and Sourface into whatever you wanted to do.**

**Goodfella: Don't you want them to leave this campus? Don't you want them to leave you alone? The only reason we're doing this is because your shitty-ass friend of yours's was too much of a pussy to break off a ""friendship"" that he only meet few months ago.**

**Me: YOU wanted them to leave this campus. I don't understand why is it so hard for you to be like, ""hey bro, I'm actually friends with Artlad too and I know we aren't close so let help you with this"" like as if it wasn't an open-secret.**

**Goodfella: Like I've told you, he will not believe me. We need to do it this why or we can't expose them.**

**Me: Well then I'm doing it my way. I'm not risking to be alone with that fucking creep!**

**Goodfella: You don't have to. Look, I have new info that we can use!**

Again with that ""Oh look! I have new info"" line as if we are detectives trying to solve a crime. But I humor him by asking:

**Me: Ok and?**

**Goodfella: Just listen. You know that barcade that's down the street from this campus?**

**Me: I mean kinda, why?**

**Goodfella: I found out after every meeting in the H.A.E.S club, he meets up with his gaming pals in that area.**

**Me: And?**

**Goodfella: And you play video games too right?**

**Me: Are...are going to say that I pretend to not know about video games to woo him or to beat his at a arcade game? Have you seen those type of dudes?**

I don't remember the rest but it was pretty much me going ""no no no, fuck no. I didn't think this through. This is too much"" and him going ""please just do it, I'll make up to it"" or something like that. I asked him if he really think this through and to my shocked, he DIDN'T!

The rest of the conversion was like:

**Me: Are kidding me right now?**

**Goodfella: Look, I don't have time to plan. It's hard to plan when you're on the time limit here.**

**Me: You know what, I'm not going with your plan instead I'm going with my own way of doing it.**

**Goodfella: How?**

**Me: Improv duh.**

**Goodfella: Really?**

**Me: Hey if I'm the one going to the lion's den, might as well take charge for once. Trust me, I know what I'm doing. I'll just talk to him at the meeting plus I have to go there anyway.**

we talked a little more but we agreed to let me do my thing, plus I didn't want to tell him that I was meeting up with a friend after the club. The rest of was me thinking how I'm going to talk to sourface about this without Artlad and Queenie knowing. Then I thought, Fuck it, I'll find him if he's on campus if he's here. But I was risking me being in the same situation as last time. However, I didn't care. The rest of the week wasn't much so I'm going to fast forward to the day to the club, still haven't spoken to Artlad at all and wasn't really ready to talk to him at the club but I plan to ignore him anyway if he lied about quitting and not tell him that I was planning to meet up with Bestbro. As I was waiting for the club to start however, Artlad did not come by at all. Good, I thought since it'll make it easier for me to toy with Sourface. (again if he did lie) It's fuzzy on some details but I think I remember looking up some alpha bro BS to get an idea on Sourface's thought process since Goodfella did say he thought of himself as an ""alpha male"". Side note, aren't alpha male wolves just taking care of their pups? Or am I remembering that wrong? Anyway, what I do kinda remember is playing on my DS when *HE* comes up to me.

**Sourface: Well well I haven't seen you in a while. Is Artlad giving you trouble?**

I quickly looked up from my game and he was flashing me with his creepy gummy smile. I look back down to my game trying not to freak out.

**Me: No Sourface. He's not. Also why do you care?**

**Sourface: I just wanted my fellow club member to be ok since you know he kinda put you in his drama. Aren't you still mad at Artlad?**

**Me: Look Sourface, I don't wanna put you into shit that's not ready a big deal. Plus I've heard you and Queenie are cousins so-**

**Sourface: What? You think I'm giving Artlad a hard time because I'm looking out for her? Nah fuck that. She's a bitch!**

At this point I'm baiting him to confess he and Queenie are seeing each other in a romantic sense. But I'm also trying to see how I'm going to do this fast and easy and without him acting creepy or thinking I fine of him being around me. So I played dumb.

**Me: I don't get it.**

**Sourface: You get how she's a bitch?**

**Me: I meant how if you don't like Queenie then why are you acting like this? It's seems everytime you two are around one of other there's this.....I don't know... tension.**

**Sourface: What do you mean?**

**Me: Look Sourface, there's I need to know. Do you hate Artlad?**

**Sourface: Pffft women, of course you won't understand how alphas show their true selves. Competition is in nature duh, it's normal two single men fight their position as the best of the best.**

**Me: Dude, answer my fucking question.**

**Sourface: Pfft typical lesbian, yes and no.**

**Me: Yes and no?! Also I'm not a lesbian! Plus you're on thin ice!**

**Sourface: HOW THE FUCK I'M ON THIN ICE!?**

**Me: You followed me to every class room and acted really gross to me. If it wasn't for Cherry being there, I could have been a lot worst then crying.**

**Sourface: Of course bitches like you don't like it when nice guys are nice. Fine, if you're so butt-hurt about it, I'm sorry ok. I'm saying sorry like a true gentleman.**

Oh be still my beating heart, who won't love a man who's this nice./s

I took a deep breath and compose myself before thinking ""maybe I should play into this like I did to Queenie"" and that's when I struck gold and said,

**Me: You know I've been thinking of something. Thinking and wondering so to speak.**

**Sourface: HA! Like what?**

**Me: If you're a nice guy right? Then why aren't you rolling in bitches of at less not single.**

**Sourface: Oh! I see where this is going.\~ You want me\~**

**Me: NO! \*clearing my throat\*** (don't want to ruin this right?) **But I know why. And my theory is the reason you hate Artlad is because HE'S the bigger alpha.**

**Sourface: BULL! I'M THE ALPHA HERE!**

**Me: Calm down Sourface. What if I could help you BE the bigger alpha. I mean, who knows more about girls then an actual girl hmmm?**

**Sourface: That's like asking a cow how to cook a steak.**

**Me: Dude come on, I know Artlad like the back of my hand and I'll make you a deal.**

**Sourface:** \*he smirks, probably thinking he's out smarting me\* **OK, let's make a deal. It's not like women are good of making deals so what is it.**

**Me: I'll write a list of traits that Artlad has and how to act like him. But!**

**Sourface: But?**

**Me: You need to make sure to out match Artlad in his own game. Think about it, girls are always giving googly eyes to Artlad. Remember, men don't chase women, so are you in? Trust me, this an open secret anyway.**

I can see he's thinking about it, I didn't confirm if he was ""chasing"" Queenie but it was obvious he when I told him that I could ""make him"" into Artlad, he's creepy grin faded into a look of ""maybe"" but he hit with:

**Sourface: If I do this, all women who's likes Artlad would fall for me?**

**Me: Not only would they fall for you, they'll feel like idiots for not falling a nice guy like you.**

**Sourface: Fine, but if this doesn't work.** ***You'll have to repay me!***

The way he said that almost triggered another episode like last time but I held firm and told me I'll write down all of it. That's when I see Ms. Mal-doll, Bonbon and Cherry coming but not Queenie. I asked them about it and both Ms. Mal-doll and Bonbon said she was busy. You can easily guess she was stalking ""her man"" but I'm not sure if her friends knew what she was up to. This was years ago but I remember Sourface's mood jumping from ""HA! Some leader she is, she couldn't handle it"" before switching to ""That bitch needs to be here so I could give her a piece of my mind."" It weird to see it unfold since well you know, they're kissing cousins. Entering the club was given the ""lessons"" that I missed last time, something about making my space fat-friendly and about micro-nutrients are just as good as getting your macros, I didn't playing attention, I was too busy writing the list for Sourface and giving to him but that's when saw Cherry looking really tired. After that whole ""lesson"", I went up to her and asking.

**Me: Hey, Cherry. Is everything okay?**

**Cherry: No, but can we talk alone, like outside.** \*she lends in to whisper\* **I don't Queenie's friends to hear me.**

With a nod we head outside the classroom and she let's out a big sigh. She really needs to vent from the sound of it.

**Me: First, I wanted to say thank you for calming me down that day with Sourface, but I can see you're stressed. I can lend an ear if you want.**

**Cherry: Dizzy, I want to quit this club, I'm the treasure here! I not supposed to do what the President's and Vice-President's jobs. Yet I'm doing all three! Ms. Mal-doll isn't any of help cuz she's dealing with Queenie! I don't know what to do**

She sounds like she's ready to cry. I go over her to hug her and tell I'm sorry you're stressed.

**Me: Cherry, I'm sorry that you're basically running this club. Maybe you should be the leader.**

**Cherry: I don't want this club. I wanted to run a different club but the campus only allows a number of clubs and Queenie took the last spot.**

**Me: Cherry, if you don't mine me asking. Why are letting a friend treat you like this?**

**Cherry:** \*wiping some tears and smiling\* **Oh Dizzy, We're not friends at all. I know is common to have friends help you when starting a club but we were never friends. We have the same classes together and she kinda asked me to help her out and thinking this could be fun.**

**Me: Look Cherry I only came back to this club for a second chance but I think nobody in the club is having fun. From what I hear, Queenie and Sourface aren't making it easy.**

**Cherry:** \*tearing up\* **You're right, a lot of people came up to me saying they want to quit but I keep telling them not my job to that and to talk to Queenie to only for them to get yelled at and me getting more work.**

In that moment, I knew this club is fucking doomed. I haven't talk about the club all this time because we actually didn't do anything! What IS there to talk about, I've spoken to some of the members there and they all join because they wanted to either learn how love their bodies, not feeling that they're ugly just because they are fat and/or they're just lonely. Instead, Queenie have this stupid rule of at less eating one snack and some other BS. No one knows what the club is about, there's too many rules and we haven't even had our first event while other clubs are planning their second or third event. Sorry for the rant, it's just a poorly ran club. After talking to Cherry, we both when back inside and I decided to leave. With Ms. Mal-doll and Bonbon fighting for me to stay, I just left and started to heading to the coffee place and with for Bestbro and Bestgal. I ordered my coffee and sit in a booth and just sit there, tired and wondering ""this plan of helping Goodfella kinda blows"" but once I couldn't think thoroughly because they're here.

**Bestbro: Hi Dizzy, I know this isn't best time.**

**Bestgal: Yeah, I thought Artlad told you already.**

**Me: It's fine, just have a sit. I'll be okay.**

Bestbro eases himself and tells me Artlad's past. This part I'll be telling you because one: FUCK ARTLAD and two, I was mostly Bestbro talking and the back and forth isn't much to note. From what Bestbro said, the reason Artlad has a hard time being alone is because Around the time both he and Artlad where in the second grade, both Artlad's parents worked and he was always alone on the weekends, since he never learned to be alone things gotten worst. Since Artlad's family and Bestbro's family are close, it wasn't a brainer to have Bestbro's family look after Artlad. So in a way, Artlad really is Bestbro's brother but his fear of being lonely grew in each passing year so he started to hang out with more and more people. Basically, Artlad was jumping from friend group to friend group. He also did a lot of crap and put a of crap on to his folks. You know your standard teenager getting to trouble cuz mommy and daddy wasn't home often. I don't want to go into too much detail because it kinda personal and even though Artlad didn't give the same respect it still has some personal details about Bestbro too. And I don't have permission from him. But what I CAN say is when both of them started highschool, Artlad meet me when I was sitting alone during lunch playing my Gameboy. Like a true extrovert, he ""adopted"" me and introduce me to Bestbro, who later meet Bestgal and where friends until senior year. Bestbro told me since meeting me and Bestgal, he seemed to calmed down and was shocked to hear that I didn't mind being alone. I kinda knew Artlad was kind of, I don't want to say jealous but more like wandering why I okay with it. I guess I grew up in a culture where they teach you ""if you fall, just get up and clean off the dirt. It's not a big deal cuz there's always next time"" and add the fact I prefer to sit my room and read or play video games, so yeah, I don't really do well with crowds. Sorry for another wall of text, I'm just adding context. After Bestbro told me this story, it made me more tired and little bit more angry cuz NONE of that makes him telling my own traumatizing past to a creep any better. I remember taking a big sip of my coffee and saying:

**Me: Bestbro, this only make me more disappointed on what Artlad fucking did.**

**Bestbro: I know, saying out loud only reminds me every time he left be alone to hang out with his new ""friends"" to not only crawl back to me and act like nothing happened.**

**Bestgal: It seems Artlad really only cares about himself at this point. Are you guys thinking of......you know...... ending the friendship?**

**Bestbro: After so many years, it feels like I'm estranging my own brother.**

**Me: Bestbro, Artlad needs to learn the hard way.** \*looking at my coffee, finally realizing what my family have been telling me\* **Sometimes, Homies tell homies to cut their shit and mean it.**

**Bestbro:** \*giving a lit chuckle\* **Homies huh? I guess you're right. Bestgal, how should I tell him though?**

**Bestgal: I can help but I want to know something from Dizzy.**

**Me: Like?**

**Bestgal: Who's the guy you've been hangout lately? Artlad have said you've been ignoring him yet see you hanging this other guy?**

**Bestbro: Yeah is there something you're not telling?**

HUH? Artlad have seen me with Goodfella? I haven't seen him anywhere at all since I can't unsee what he did. But he somewhat knows Goodfella right? Or did Goodfella said something to Artlad since they do hang out from time to time. But I was calm and said:

**Me: you mean Goodfella? He's just a guy that I'm doing a project with.**

**Bestbro: Ah! So I guess he's just sad you're hangout with someone else. Like always.**

**Me: Plus I haven't seen him at all and yet he's around the campus and doesn't come up to me to at less say hi?**

**Bestgal: That IS a bit weird.**

**Bestbro: Maybe it's that girl from that fatty club. I don't even want to know what her deal is.**

I wish I didn't know too, BOY do I wish.

**Me: I'm not going back to that shitty club anyway. I'm. So. Done.**

**Bestgal: Do either of you know what kind of blackmail she might have on him?**

**Bestbro: Blackmail?**

**Me: He did say both Queenie and Sourface are willing to blackmail him. Mostly Sourface however. Do you know Sourface and Queenie by chance anyway?**

**Bestgal: I don't. Sorry.**

**Bestbro: I've meet Sourface a handful of times. That motherfucker always bitches and moans about girls not like him cuz he's fat and ""nice"". I hate that guy, always bringing the mood down.**

**Me: You mean ""cousin-fucker"" right. Sourface seems to really hate Artlad too.**

Bestbro and Bestgal smirk at my remark, they 100% know what's going since Artlad doesn't hide anything from Bestbro. 

**Bestbro: Wow how two-face, I'm not shocked really. Before this drama, Artlad would brag about meeting all these chicks and say ""dude, college girls are on a whole other level man. And the parties are crazy too"" as if he's not wasting his money not doing school work.**

**Me: And worst part, it seems he doesn't realized Sourface into that whole alpha-male BS.**

**Bestgal: Really? Alpha-male? Does he own a blanket with a wolf or something?**

**Me: First of all, we Mexicans owned those blankets first and second, even if he did that doesn't change the fact he's banging his cousin.**

**Bestbro: Look Dizzy, I want you to keep an eye out on this Goodfella. He might be helping you and treating you better then Artlad right now but he IS the younger brother of Sourface. I have a bad feeling about this guy.**

**Me: What do you mean?**

**Bestbro: Sometimes you tell a lot about them based on their family. They may not like each other but they were raised together. Old habits die hard one might say.**

At this point, I was thinking how Goodfella acted around me and that one time Sourface bothered us. I give the name ""Goodfella"" because he seemed too laxed when it came to having his uncle cutting their college money even though he won't get more from it. Also the fact he kinda acted and sounds like the main character of ""Goodfellas"" but a younger and gay version of him. With that said,  all three of us said our goodbyes and I headed home. As I was walking, I really took a hard look at myself. I didn't tell Bestbro and Bestgal the plan that I had with Goodfella. Maybe because they'll look at me funny or think I was fucking with them or maybe, just maybe, they'll tell me what I'm doing is the most stupidest thing ever. Honestly, they would be right, making a plan where I give a girl a list of traits in hopes of her making an ass of herself and making the guy jealous and that same guy, I helped making him more like his ""rival"" in order to push the fall out faster? Yeah, it IS stupid. ""Why should I care? Why is Goodfella willing to help and why I'm the only to help"", these questions I keep asking myself. As I make it home I go to my room and really think about on what to next. I thought to myself, ""maybe it's time to break the silence with Artlad"" because if I'm going to be part of this, then I needed to know this ""blackmail"" was even a real think or another of his lies. I actually go to my computer and log in to a group chat where the friend group always use.

So I send him a message asking if I can chat with him in private and wait for his response but it doesn't take long for him to message back.

**Artlad: Oh hey Dizzy, long time no speak right?**

**Me: I'll make this quick Artlad, do you remember what you said to me when we meet at the park?**

**Artlad: About Queenie wanting to mess with my relationships?**

**Me: No about Sourface and Queenie wanting to blackmail you? Where you being truthful?**

**Artlad: Of course I was! You think I'm lying? It's only Sourface tho.**

**Me: You have been spoon feeding me info that's incomplete. What kind of blackmail does he even have? Aren't you two friends?**

**Artlad: I thought he was my friend, but I guess not. He tends to shit talk me behind my back to his gaming buddies yet asks me and Bestbro about girls and crap.** 

**Me: Answer the question dude.** 

**Artlad: He did told Queenie what kind blackmail he has on me but,**

**Me: But?**

**Artlad: He's willing to give my address to Queenie as well as my place of work and where my family lives. He said if I stop hanging out with Queenie he promise he won't leak it.**

**Me: That doesn't add up at all. Why is he asking you that?**

**Artlad: He said if I don't, he and his buddies are going to gang up on me and beat the shit out of me after he leaks it so that Queenie learns her place. His words not mine.** 

**Me: Do you really think Sourface can kick your ass? Or is this another lie?**

**Artlad: NO I DON'T! It's the leaking part I'm worried about. Plus, it's him and four of his gaming buddies and if they're anything like Sourface, they have size on their side.** 

**Me: Can you just I don't know, report them? This has to break some kind of rule.** 

**Artlad: I did but it was thrown out because I didn't have evidence of Queenie's stalking and about Sourface's threat. Sourface was smart enough to say it face to face and send it though text.** 

**Me: Have you seen Queenie anywhere?**

**Artlad: Nope. Nowhere, I like to keep it that way.** 

**Me: What about Sourface? Are you sure he has your locations?**

**Artlad: I haven't seen him at all, plus when I tried to call out his bluff he wrote it down as if he memorized them. He wasn't bluffing.** 

I really wanted to feel bad for him, I really do but I was numb to everything. If Sourface could figure out where Artlad was staying then that means Queenie did too. But I was will to throw my ""friend"" to the lions just because I was upset. I told Artlad that I'll talk to him more once I'm ready and did I only wanted to talk to him just to make sure and he was fine with that. After shutting the chat, I took another hard into this mess I was in. For some reason, Something in the back of my head was telling me ""this is going to end now or later"" and as well as ""you need to put a stop to this stupid drama or you WILL be drained"". I took a deep breath and told myself that the waiting game may have started but you need to get out of it NOW. Not because it's hurting people but the plan is really ridiculous. I also thought maybe Artlad is messing with me. BUT I a text from an unknown number. I was about to delete the text when another one coming causing me to panic. It was from Sourface. 

**Sourface: HI! It's Sourface, I got your number from Goodfella. Hehe Pretty cool right, now I can ask all the questions I want without having to wait for the next club meeting. I ordered Goodfella to give it to me since you two share the same class.** 

Pretty sure he just bitch and moan while Goodfella was going ""no we're not pals and GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOME!"" as Sourface wanted to ""show off"" his alpha-ness. But I really hate myself for going with Goodfella's plan because now Sourface has my number. I knew right then and there Goodfella did it for me to toy with him. I was starting to panic because Sourface might do something worst then what he did in part 4. I took a couple of deep breaths and try not to rock the boat so I texted

**Me: Dude, I'm kinda busy at the moment. Just ask your questions and I'll get back to you when I can.** 

**Sourface: Actually, I was hoping you can meet me face to face. My time valuable you see, and I was hoping for you to make time to meet up.** 

NOPE NOPE NOPE, NAH UH! Not going to happen, I do not want to go near him. However, I didn't know what to say because again I, stupidly, wanted to continue with the plan. So, of course, I texted Goodfella on what to do. To my surprise, he said he'll handle it and just tell him that I was really busy but be ""nice"" about it. 

**Me: Sorry Sourface, I don't know when I'll have free time to meet up. Rain check on that?**

**Sourface: Whatever, I'm with my buddies anyway. I'll text when I feel like it.** 

I pray for him to never text me back but it was in vain. I didn't text back cuz he creeps me the fuck out. To this day he doesn't like me at all and I would tell you guys why but I'll be spoiling future tales about Goodfella and oh boy, Sourface in those tales was way worst. I want to finish my school work when I got a text from Bestgal. 

**Bestgal: Hey Dizzy, do you have time to text? I want to talk to you, girl to girl.**

**Me: Hey, yeah I have time. What is it?**

**Bestgal: I wanted to know if you're fine. Back in the coffee place, you look so tired.** 

**Me: I'm fine Bestgal, it's just all those sleepless nights trying to finish what's due, you know.**

**Bestgal: College stress doesn't make you lose weight Dizzy. In fact there's a reason why people say they gain the ""freshmen fifteen"". I know you long enough to know that something is up.** 

Am I really losing weight? In the moment I didn't think so but looking back at some old photos of mine, I really did lose some weight, actually I've lost about 20 pounds in that month, like I said last time I didn't mean to I just wasn't taking care of myself. I guess it gotten to the point where people are starting notice, even with my puffy sweaters. But I texted:

**Me: Nah, there's no way I've lost weight. I'm not doing anything for that.** 

**Bestgal: Are you saying that because of that club?** 

**Me: Nope. I don't pay attention half the time in that club, also I skipped more then one meeting anyway. Still my point stands.**

**Bestgal: Dizzy, you look like you've been working overtime. Do you have a job as well then?**

**Me: Kinda, My cousin that I'm staying with pays me to watch her kids when she and husband want a night out. It's not hard.** 

**Bestgal: Then quit your bullshit and tell me was going on? I know you're hang out with that guy.**

I mean I did say It was a small campus, I knew at some point someone was going to say something or ask what we've been up to. I did think it was a big deal as long as no one could figure out the plan. I texted Bestgal:

**Me: The reason I'm ""hanging out"" with him is cuz we have an art project to do together.** 

**Bestgal: I don't know why but Artlad says he has a really bad vibe about that dude.** 

**Me: I don't care what Artlad says and it's not a big deal. We're literally just working at the library.**

**Bestgal: I guess if you say you're fine then you're fine. I'm only texting you because Artlad told me so.** 

**Me: Dude, I just messaged him a little while ago, over a private chat. Why was he so worried?**

**Bestgal: Did you really?** 

I then send her a picture of the chat so she doesn't think I'm lying. but she said left me confused and a little bit mad. 

**Bestgal: Huh, He told me you haven't spoken to him for some time now. And he send me a text just now to check for him since you weren't answering his text.** 

**Me: I don't know when he send that text but I did talked to him. Seems scared about his ""new pals"".** 

**Bestgal: That's why I wanted to text you. I was also wandering if Goodfella is acting like spy for that Queenie and/or Sourface. He IS their family after all.** 

**Me: I don't think so. If he was, wouldn't he try to follow me everywhere including trying to hang out every chance he got?** (I was trying to throw a curve ball)

**Bestgal: I guess that's true. Plus Artlad did say he only sees you library with him. Since he said He's going back monday and only goes to campus to get some things, he'll want to meet up.** 

**Me: I'm not really ready to face just yet. How do I know if he's not hanging around that creep in the first place.** 

**Bestgal: Hard to say. Just remember what Bestbro said. Keep an eye out for Goodfella, I think Bestbro has meet him before.** 

**Me: Huh? Weird, text you soon? I have to finish.** 

**Bestgal: Yeah, text ya later.** 

I was just staring at my phone in a daze. What ringing in my mind was Bestgal saying ""I think Bestbro has meet Goodfella before"", I know Artlad lets Sourface hang with him from time to time and I know that some of those time are with Bestbro as well. I never heard or been told that Goodfella was good friends with Artlad and the time I've talked to Goodfella about how does he know Artlad and not ONCE did Goodfella say that he hang out with any of them. I know for a fact Goodfella will NOT hang out with his bro, like at all. Every time I tell him to maybe have a brother to brother talk he'll give this calm but obvious angered look and tell me ""not everybody has good family they've born into like you,"" so I dropped it. Maybe I was overthinking it and thought maybe Artlad meet him one time because of his bro and/or overheard the bullshit that Artlad pulled? I don't know. At this point it doesn't matter how and what mattered is just finishing with the plan and just forget about this mess and continue with my schooling.  

I got up from my sit and headed out from my room and headed towards the kitchen to refill my cup with coffee when I got another text but this time it was from Goodfella. With a sip of the good ol' bean juice I read the text. 

**Goodfella: Good news! I handled Sourface without him wandering what was up. You don't have to respond to this but I also played to his ""alpha male"" BS. However, you're going to hate me for this but I've told him and you can only hang out with him IF you show off his ""gaming skills"" in front of his friends.** 

I almost spat out coffee and having to excuse myself from the kitchen since Chik√≠ and her family were right there. I was pissed so I texted

**Me: WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU! I've told you that I'm not going to be alone with that creep!**

**Goodfella: Easy easy now, I wasn't planning on that to happen. No I've made it clear the ""you"" wanted him and his friends to show off his skills. Plus I added that him showing that he can make friends outside of the club makes him look really alpha. I pointed out that's why Artlad gets laid. And he took the bait.** 

**Me: I'm not wasting my weekend on that creep!**

**Goodfella: And you're not. It's on Monday after you're done with your classes.** 

**Me: HUH?! You already set it up? How and where?**

**Goodfella: You don't need to know how just the ""where"". Remember that barcade I was talking about? That's where you'll meet him. Don't worry, I'll be watching you in the shadows, just far enough that no one will notice.** 

**Me: If I see it's only him, Imma run for the hills or kick your ass.** 

**Goodfella: I won't blame you, like I said, I'll make sure his friends are there too.** 

**Me: Is it too late for me to come out and start transitioning yet?**

**Goodfella: So he doesn't flirt with you?**

**Me: DUH! Why else? I don't wanna be a girl anymore!** 

**Goodfella: I say start by finding an outfit that screams ""NOT STRAIGHT"" and ""SOON TO BE BOY""** 

**Me: I always look like I just rolled out of bed. How I'm going to do that?**

**Goodfella: Sunday is my day off, wanna meet up for shopping? I can even help you pay for it? Think of it as a gift for putting up with mine and my family's bullcrap.** 

I was texting this as I came back to the kitchen less angry and help out with dinner. In my journal I've wrote ""I can't believe my prima didn't ask questions about what was that about but I figured she knows I'm still dealing with BS. I however tried my best to not show the plan and I was talking to the brother of a creep, but she did get upset with me texting during dinner. To quote she said *""Prima! If you don't stop texting at the dinner table, Imma smack that phone off your fingers and make you clean the toilet with your toothbrush!""* and I couldn't help but laugh. But the last text Goodfella have send to me was ""I'm waiting if you're in or out with both the meet up on Monday and the Sunday shopping day. Yes or no?""

And of course I've said yes. Not because I'm getting free clothes, is because I have no clue on what to do or what even IS a barcade? I'm not joking, I've never heard that at all and I was wondering if I could even enter it if it had the word ""bar"" in it. So I texted back and told him to text me when he's ready to go shopping. The rest of that night was quite and I did some of my school work but I was in a daze. I know I've said it was just Goodfella and I acting like mean girls but I guess I was having a hard time doing that because I've never hurt someone like that. 

And with that I'll end it here. The end is near and the next post is where I go shopping and meet up with Sourface. I still can't I did this to myself but what I can promise you is that the downfall is not what you're expecting.

He did a 12 hour stream, because he was jealous of Austin (yes, he actually said this). I used to LOVE watching him and all the fun shenanigans. But, the mods have started being really rude to the chat and often blow things out of proportion. It's like they thrive off of being in control and creating drama. Also, because James misses 75%of the comments, he never really knows what is happening. They just have free reign. Even they say terrible things in the chat about James not reading the chat or answering their messages. But, the chat can't say anything and must remain positive.ü•¥
Today was really rough during his IRL. The mods and chat kept telling him to remember his jacket, take his painting, get coffee, lock the door, remember your keys. Just short of asking him if he needed to go potty! The second anyone says something like ""He is fine, he has this"" or "" he will figure it out, he is fine"" the whole chat will jump on you and take the comments out of context. It is like a group of cackling hens who have to have control over everything he does and says. James is losing so much support and viewers because of the mods and their incessant need to control him, the chat, and what we are allowed to say. A couple of weeks ago while live with Sadie, the whole chat went crazy because James was going to put honey on his face and say something like ""I love the taste of your honey"" and all hell broke loose. The chat started to say it was disrespectful to Liz and they forbid him from doing the punish. They even went to Sadie's chat to tell her how disrespectful it would be for him to do it. The next day, the whole series was canceled with Sadie. If he can't break loose from the handcuffs that the mods and the mom's in the chat have on him, he will soon become just a small streamer with a room full of mommies telling him when to eat and drink, what to wear and where to go. 

James, if you read this, please take the time to really hear us when we say that your mods, and many in the chat, make it miserable to be there to enjoy your LIVES. You are barely holding 300 people now and with the potential for Tiktok leaving, you won't have people following you elsewhere if that is how your streaming career continues.

1hwbubm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1hwbubm/the_boy_next_door/,THE BOY NEXT DOOR,"Serin couldn‚Äôt stand the boy named Marshad who lived next door. If there had been a way to measure the extent of her annoyance, it would have easily surpassed the size of the Atlantic Ocean. And the reason for this frustration was simple‚ÄîMarshad completely ignored her. It wasn‚Äôt just any ordinary dismissal; it was on an extreme level, as if he thought he was the most knowledgeable person in the world. 



For example, just a few days ago, on the day Mr. returned from Canada with his degree, things took another turn.



After taking a shower, Serin was washing her hair on the small rooftop attached to her room when she saw a young man getting out of a Persian black car. From her vantage point above, it was hard to make out his face. The sunlight, reflecting off a mirror in the corner of the rooftop, fell directly into her eyes. However, when she saw the car parked in front of Marisha Aunty‚Äôs house, she quickly realized that the young man was Marisha Aunty‚Äôs son, who had just returned from England. Serin tried to get a better look at him through the gap between her fingers, but in that very moment, she removed her sunglasses to see him more clearly and was caught by his eyes.



Through the small gap in her fingers, she saw his light yellowish eyes. At that exact moment, her heart skipped a beat for reasons she couldn't understand. She quickly regained composure, flashing him a sweet smile and waving her hand. She always tried to introduce herself to new people, but this time, the handsome young man in the navy blue shirt did not respond at all. He merely looked at her with an indifferent expression, then walked into the house. Serin‚Äôs ego was bruised. How dare he ignore her like that? She swore to herself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make him pay for this.‚Äù



Days passed, and one time when Rodshi went to Marisha Aunty‚Äôs house with kebabs, the woman began chatting about various things. However, Serin paid little attention to her. The moment Mrs. Marisha left to make coffee, Serin quickly stood up, eager to finally meet this young man. 



When she reached the second floor, she saw him standing by the window at the end of the hallway, engrossed in a book. He wore glasses, and his silky hair fell over his forehead. A cup of coffee sat beside him, sending steam into the air. Serin approached him, extending her hand with a warm greeting. 



""Hi. I‚Äôm Rodshi. Nice to meet you,"" she said with a smile.



But the young man didn‚Äôt reciprocate. He didn‚Äôt shake her hand, nor did he say a word. He just stared at her, unwavering. Not once did he blink. Serin tried to decipher the expression in his eyes but failed. His eyes were empty‚Äîemotionless, calm like the water of a lake, and deep like the ocean. She stood there for a moment, lost in the intensity of his gaze, but eventually, he turned away without a word and walked off, completely ignoring her. 



And so, Serin‚Äôs frustration with him began to grow. She tried repeatedly to talk to him, but he always remained indifferent. And as always, we tend to chase those who ignore us. The same happened with Serin. Despite his repeated rejections, she kept trying to speak with him. Over time, she learned his name‚ÄîMarshad. His name, like his appearance, was admirable, but his behavior was downright contemptible. She finally decided, ""This is the last time I will try. If he doesn‚Äôt speak to me after this, I‚Äôll never talk to him again. Not a word. Even if he dies wanting to speak to me, I won‚Äôt say a single thing to him."" 



\---



It was the end of December, and the falling leaves revealed the harsh solitude of winter. On a foggy morning, Serin made up her mind to confront Marshad. She wrapped a thick shawl around her neck, pulled her hair into a messy bun, and wore a simple bunny T-shirt. She carefully opened the door to the rooftop next to her room. Luckily, Serin‚Äôs rooftop and Marshad‚Äôs rooftop were attached, so with one jump, she could be on his side. Today, she felt fate might be kinder.



As she jumped over, she saw him‚ÄîMarshad‚Äîstanding on the railing. He wore a loose, off-white half-sleeve tunic and light blue pants, his dry hair blowing in the wind. Serin couldn‚Äôt help but want to fix his hair. She stood on the railing beside him, trying to catch his attention, but he remained still‚Äîunwavering like a mountain.



""Do you dislike me?"" she asked.



Marshad remained silent.



""If you dislike me, just say so. I won‚Äôt bother you again. But what does this treatment mean?"" she pressed, trying to understand him.



Still, he didn‚Äôt move. He didn‚Äôt even spare her a glance. Instead, he ignored her completely and turned toward his room. Serin, the only daughter of her parents, had been pampered and loved her whole life. This was the first time she had felt so rejected. Her frustration reached a boiling point, and in a fit of rage, she blocked his path.



Through gritted teeth, she said, ""I will never forget this humiliation, Marshad. I will remember this for the rest of my life. I don‚Äôt know why God gave a person like you the ability to speak.""



Tears welled up in her eyes as she turned and ran back to her room. She didn‚Äôt look back, not once. If only she had looked back, she might have seen the pain in his eyes‚Äîthe helplessness of someone unable to speak. It was the end of so many years of one-sided love.

Should i let it go? I am worried he loved her more and would never tell me. Was it a sign I saw her ? I feel he was very loving and calm with her and sometimes he isn‚Äôt that way with me. I asked him to stop drinking for 1 month with me and he said no. But come to find out he stopped drinking for  a month with her? 
Also- he wrote a post on here a month before we met. He said he loved her and felt worthless when she ended it and should he let her go. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have read it. But I did. She wasn‚Äôt right for him he knows that (age gap, different religions , values , hobbies etc) but does that matter? I know a lot of people romanticize someone who rejected them. 
He says he wants to marry me but still feel like she was the one who got away and he will never tell me the truth. Any advice on what to do?

1hwbhwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1hwbhwj/i_need_yalls_input_here/,I need yalls input here.,"Okay so here goes..Im 29 and moved back home with my mom after 12 years in another state  partially because my lease was up and I  didn't want to stay where I was and partially because I wanted to work on repairing our relationship. Bad idea.



 She is very loving and has for the most part been an incredible mother. There was childhood abuse but I feel in my heart I've forgiven her. I want so badly to have her approval and for her to like me (I know she loves me but have never felt liked by her) she is very OCD and likes everything a certain way.



 I always fall short or do things ""wrong"" by her standards. For example i can never clean good enough, I put groceries away incorrectly, ect. And then theres the element of her incessant complaining..she has a specific chair she likes to sit on at church (the congregation is over a thousand people) and if someone sits in ""her chair"" she will totally freak out about it, being in the car with her is so stressful because she drives like a bat outta hell and complains about everybody elses driving, going shoping with her is even more stressful because she complains about almost every person in the store and seems bothered that she isnt the only person there. She has zero consideration for anybody else's time or space. Everything HAS TO happen on her time line no exceptions. 


 I love to paint my nails and asked her several times if i can paint her toes and she denied me everytime. I tried planning several outtings together but because the car ride there was so stressful and upon arriving she complained the whole time, it wasnt fun but rather bothersome and frustrating. 

I want so badly to have a relationship with my mom where we can go shopping and do girl stuff go out for coffee and just enjoy eachother but its so hard when she is complaining and always dissatisfied either with me or with what's going on. I am always feeling like my presence is bothersome to her because I don't fit into her box of what is acceptable or share her distaste for the general public (I love being around people and mingleing) i tend to just go with the flow. Tensions had been kinda high but we were getting by. 



Well the other day I was texting a friend and he asked if I was going to church I responded by saying ""no my mom's cunty-ness is too much today""...well when she got back from church I was in the bathroom doing my hair, she needed to use the toilet so I stepped out and left my phone in there..she went thru my phone and she seen the message and freaked out. 


She screamed at me and told me to leave, i remained calm, she grew angrier and got in my face and hit me scratched my face and neck (these scratches will leave permanent scaring) I hit her back and broke/tore up things of hers and things of mine she's given me.

 she then called the police. The police came and waited till i got all my stuff loaded. I haven't been back here in over a decade and have no other family or friends in the area. The police felt sorry for me and got me a hotel voucher for that night.I live in Colorado and it has been below freezing and snowing for the last few days.


 I am staying at a woman's shelter in downtown Denver. I am so hurt and have so many emotions around what happened. She blocked me on everything. I wanted this relationship to heal. I understand it was wrong to call her a C*%t to my friend but that was a private conversation and she helped herself into my phone. her hitting me in the face and throwing me out on the streets in the middle of winter seems extreme. 


Since being home I haven't talked disrespectfully or argued directly with her. I was really putting forth an effort to practice love and tolerance. However I know that I am not innocent in the situation and am open to feedback. So im asking for perspective and advice on how to move forward. What's the next right thing? How do I accept her decision? 


I am so disappointed in my self for hitting her back and destroying the things I did. I was so angry and so hurt when she told me she didn't want me in her home and didnt care what happened to me on the streets. I have been out of work since moving here. I was supposed to start work yesterday but because of everything that happened I couldn't show up to that job and have my place at this shelter because of the shelter cerfew. Just so much.

I‚Äôm pretty certain I‚Äôm going to trade in my 2020 4Runner for a 2025 Subaru Outback. I made a [longer post](https://www.reddit.com/r/4Runner/comments/1htv4q9/considering_trading_2020_4runner_for_subaru/) over on the 4Runner subreddit about it, but in a nutshell:

* Moved from AZ to Seattle this year and most of my driving is city/urban + adjusting the consistently wet weather
* I can get $36-42k for the 4Runner, which would let me get an Outback for around what I have left on the 4Runner + should qualify for the 2.9% deal going on
* Will do some hiking/camping/exploring in WA/OR but nothing where I‚Äôd be using the 4Runner‚Äôs 4WD or that an Outback couldn‚Äôt handle
* More pragmatic/practical car with AWD and comfort / features than my 2020 4Runner

  
I've read a bunch of posts / reviews / blogs about the outback and will be going to test drive them as well as rent one for 2-3 days to feel confident in the choice. I love my 4Runner, so want to make sure it's the right move.

I'm trying to decide between the Wilderness and Touring XT, so would appreciate some feedback from the community here + would take any advice if other people have done the same 4Runner to Outback or vice versa.

Context on what I'm thinking through for the decision:

* \~95% of the time I'd be city/urban driving and 5% of the time I'd be going camping/hiking with my partner + our two larger dogs (\~65-70 pounds). For camping/hiking, I'm not going romping in the mountains but rather tent camping that's not that far away from where you usually park. No amateur filming of Man vs Wild for me.
   * We do plan to pick-up winter sports, but I have to learn to drive in snow + would get tire socks/chains as I saw some require you to carry them. Don't worry, I've watched numerous YT videos on how to put them on lol.
* 1-2x/year (maybe just once, long drive...) driving back to Arizona, with the dogs/partner, for an extended stay to see family
* My 4Runner is sturdy, dependable and will likely go on to survive for another 20 years. I'd like a dependable vehicle, which I have minor concerns about the CVT/Gasket issues I've read about.
* The 4Runner lacks some of the modern amenities I admittedly envy in my partner's Volvo, such as: remote start, safety features (Subaru's eyesight equivalent, blind-spot, smart rear-view etc etc), heated seats / steering wheel and so on.

Some questions:

* Is the dual-function X-MODE necessary for getting up to the common ski areas around WA/Oregon or is that for people trying to go find Sasquatch?
* How big of an on-going issue is the CVT/Gasket issues I've read about?
* How much below MSRP is realistic in the PNW, especially Seattle since these seem as beloved as coffee?
* It seems there are bountiful quantities of the Wilderness trim in the general Seattle area and far fewer Touring XT models, is this normal or a by-product of the market I'm in?

Based on what I've read, and since I've barely used the 4Runner's 4WD capabilities in the 4 years I've owned it, it seems that the Touring XT is the better choice for what I'll be doing but if you've made it this far, I appreciate you and thanks for the help.

Is this worth it or not? ","As the title says, I‚Äôm f23, and my partner/boyfriend (m25) of 4 years has been lying to my face. On December 20/21st, last month, he was given a winter break almost with his work and had no work until today. He started back up again at his job. During the break, I had this weird feeling. Things are good, we have our moments but we‚Äôve sorted things out. He‚Äôs had issues with online lusting and wandering in the past, I‚Äôve caught him and called him out on it. He changed several habits in order to regain trust from me. This was 2/3 years ago. We had to call our hydro place because we moved recently and our bill was weird and showing us a bill for our old address, called the place. He didn‚Äôt want to talk so he gave me his phone, it was on hold for over 30 minutes. He was sitting right beside me pretty much, him on our couch and me at his desk which is right beside the couch‚Ä¶ and a creeping feeling was like do it. Just look. So I looked at his instagram and then for some reason I never felt the need to look at his photos before, just socials.. I looked at his photos and in his deleted/trash (he has a Samsung) there was a picture of him in our bathroom here our new place, he was holding his junk in his hand, it was hard‚Ä¶ The tap going in the course. I downloaded the photo back on to his phone to get more info, and when I clicked on the ‚ÄúI‚Äù it said the picture was from Reddit and taken at 6:10am.. on December 30th. 5 days after our 4th anniversary.. there was also another picture from November of him shirtless in a bathroom at his work‚Ä¶ also says Reddit. He was never big on grooming his down stairs but he did that before he took the dick pic, and when he told me he was shaving I did slightly question. Because the 4 years we‚Äôve been together he‚Äôs shaved maybe 2 or 3 times‚Ä¶ which I don‚Äôt mind, I love his hair and natural body and he knows this. When I confronted him about it last night, being as calm and collected as I could be. I‚Äôm not stupid. It‚Äôs from Reddit and I‚Äôve caught him messaging/secting people on Reddit in the past, 2/3 years ago like I said‚Ä¶ and it was in his deleted‚Ä¶ he just said he didn‚Äôt know he had any nudes son his phone and if so it would be from a long time ago. I said well no because the picture was in our bathroom here and it was taken in December. He told me he didn‚Äôt know. And then said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt post or delete every pic you take of yourself‚Äù like it meant something? Sure I don‚Äôt do that but it‚Äôs not the point. Also out of the 4 years we‚Äôve been together he has never ONCE sent me a nude. Even when he went away to work for nearly a month in the summer last year.. I‚Äôve sent him plenty and even have an instagram made just for him for my nude pics in case he gets bored. He‚Äôs asked me for nudes multiple times also. I didn‚Äôt out right be like hey you did this but I did say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre doing something behind my back, and I‚Äôd like it to stop. And if you care about our relationship and want it to continue then you will stop‚Äù he still says idk and shrugged it off. Then he went back to work today, and he‚Äôs been getting really close with a female coworker‚Ä¶ he is always scheduled to work with her, and being out with her on job sites (they‚Äôre construction workers) and he lied to me about her giving him rides for a while because he said he knew I‚Äôd react poorly. I didn‚Äôt care about the rides I cared about him lying to me. I‚Äôve told him this‚Ä¶ but he comes back from work today, with a look in his eyes like his face is lit up, joyous, and then when he goes to kiss me‚Ä¶ his mouth tasted like vag.. and it‚Äôs ironic because idek what vag tastes like but if it‚Äôs makes sense it tasted like that.. I joked a bit and said ‚Äúmaybe you should brush your teeth in the shower (he was going to shower, he does shortly after getting home from work) pee eww your breath kinda of smells like p*ssy‚Äù he responded  ‚Äúoh all I ate was the food you packed me for lunch, a coffee, and my vape maybe is why??‚Äù And then I didn‚Äôt respond so he started going off about how it was the pasta sauce from the food I packed him and how it was probably that. I then asked him again like an hour later and was looking into his eyes, he looked straight back into my eyes held contact but his eye and mouth twitched when he said ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt eat any p*ssy‚Äù I don‚Äôt really know what to do anymore. My ex use to come home with p*ssy breath too and it was because he was cheating on me.. and just with everything idk what the hell to think or do. How do I communicate to him, it‚Äôs not like we can‚Äôt talk or communicate with each other it‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt care. He‚Äôll tell me one thing and go to another‚Ä¶ and not to mention about what I said about him sending a dick pic in Dec 30th. The VERY NEXT DAY (this was before I knew too) he bought me hundred of dollars worth of computer stuff to help me finish building my computer‚Ä¶ and I politely told him ‚Äúno that‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm gonna wait and save up to get it myself! So you don‚Äôt have to spend that much money‚Äù he was soooo insistent and then when I found the couture and I realized the date I was like wait a sec. So now I feel like he does nice gestures , if not overly nice gestures when he feels guilty? and so if he feels so guilty and buys me a bunch of shit with out asking and won‚Äôt take my nice refusal, why the f*ck is he doing this to me? I‚Äôm so hurt and confused and I don‚Äôt know what to do next.

And i am plus size so I was in the past not so confident with my looks but I am slowly adapting to it and liking my body figure, he has also told me that he finds my body type attractive and he has also told me I look hot and all and in the meantime he has also asked to go for a cup of coffee but I was busy that day so I told him I couldn't. And as I have college and other stuff so I really couldn't focus on dating apps that often so I told him let's exchange socials but he told me he doesn't have any socials ( which is weird or a red flag idk) so I told him ok, then we exchanged our number but lately as I text him his replies has been late for like 6 to 7 hours which I didn't mind, but then now I have texted him something and he hasn't replied to me and it's been like 2 to 3 days so I thought he must have been busy with his work or maybe something happened to him , and then I saw on his dating profile this morning that he was active an hour ago. So what should I do now? Do I block him? Or confront him? Or wait for him to reply? ",1,1736310444.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False

[$900],"My wife and I currently have a Nespresso and I drink espressos and she will use it to make coffee. I want to get away from pods and could use some advice. We both love cortados and would like to start making milk drinks. We both drink 1-2 drinks a day.  

I am the engineer that likes to over engineer things and optimize. I might also like to make a few decaf espresso. My wife likes to keep thing simple. She doesn't mind doing things from scratch (excellent cook and baker) but she doesn't want to use a scale or stopwatch to make coffee in the morning.

Is the Breville Impress Express a good middle ground? The built in tamper seems unnecessary, but might keep things clean and easy which is a big plus for my wife. If I decide I want to optimize and play around I figure I can get a different grinder in the future and bypass the built in grinder and tamper. This could be useful for decaf as well.

One of the most frustrating things for me as I restart my weight loss journey after several years of chaos is that everything is so effing *sweets* based. Want a protein shake to help meet your protein requirements? Hope you like chocolate or vanilla or banana or strawberry or coffee. Want to increase your greens really fast with a green smoothie or juice? Better like bananas and apples, because you're not getting that extra cup of spinach from a Green Goddess smoothie without those! Or monk fruit or Stevia or sucralose to sweeten everything. 

I just wish there was like, a beef pho flavored protein shake or a mint chutney smoothie. I'm seriously considering just taking an immersion blender to my next bowl of pho and seeing what happens at this point. 

Does anyone know of more savory/salty forms of these food forms?",10,1736310205.0,loseit,18,0.67,False
1hwb8xl,https://www.reddit.com/r/babyloss/comments/1hwb8xl/stillbirth_twisted_umbilical_cord/,Stillbirth - twisted umbilical cord,"I recently experienced a stillbirth at 29 weeks (4 weeks postpartum now). My doctor said the cause was likely a **twisted umbilical cord near the baby‚Äôs belly button**, which reduced blood flow. They reassured me that I don‚Äôt need to wait before trying again and gave me the green light to try whenever I feel ready.

**Questions I have:**

1. **Why don‚Äôt I need to wait?** Most advice I‚Äôve seen recommends waiting between pregnancies to allow the body time to recover. Is this advice different for stillbirth at 7 months? Does it really take less of a toll on the body compared to full-term birth?
2. **What causes umbilical cord twisting?** My doctor didn‚Äôt give a clear explanation for why the cord twisted. One theory I read about online mentioned it could potentially be caused by pressure changes (not a lot of info available), and I can‚Äôt stop wondering‚Äî
   * Could a long flight (8‚Äì10 hours) I took just a few days before have caused this?
   * Are there other potential causes?
   * How can I monitor or prevent this from happening again in future pregnancies?
   * What is the risk of recurrence?

**Other factors worth mentioning:**

* I have **hypothyroidism**, which was managed throughout my pregnancy with monthly blood tests.
* Family history of **Hashimoto‚Äôs** (though I haven‚Äôt been officially diagnosed).
* My blood tests showed low protein S but a normal coagulation panel so the doctor was not worried that this was a contributing factor.

Other random thoughts:   
\- Is there a link with coffee consumption, stress, sleep deprivation, TDAP vaccination, etc? (So far what I've seen is not really....) If you have any studies available, that would be very helpful.

I‚Äôm just looking for some clarity, personal experiences, or even reassurance. Thank you so much in advance. üíõ",7,1736309970.0,babyloss,2,1.0,False
1hwb7v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1hwb7v0/coffee_help_wanted/,Coffee Help Wanted!,"Hello all,

Complete noob when it comes to everything coffee here. I was starting to do some research looking at YouTube videos, reading articles on google, looking up types of beans, etc. and started to quickly get overwhelmed. I was hoping that I could get some assistance from some coffee enthusiasts. I was hoping to start getting into making my own coffee at home and was looking for information/suggestions. I'm mainly interested in the CAFFEINE CONTENT, as I'm not huge on the special flavors each blend has (to me they all kind of taste the same -- sorry, don't mean to offend the coffee lovers i know there's a lot that goes into it all). I'm interested in high caffeine content normal coffee, **NOT** some stuff that I saw that had extra added caffeine to the beans with some reaching upwards of 600-1200mg of caffeine.

1.) I read that lighter roasts tend to have more caffeine than dark roasts as the heat gets rid of some of the caffeine in the dark roasts, however i saw a video by James Hoffmann on YouTube from \~2 years ago testing caffeine content of different brews (light, med, dark) and it was the complete opposite. Something roughly like 62mg/dl, 67.5mg/dl, and 72mg/dl respectively. -- Which has the most caffeine, Light/Med/Dark roast?

2.) I saw Robusta beans have more caffeine content than Arabica. If this is true should I look for a Robusta bean blend over Arabica? -- Which beans/blends of coffee are the best to buy in terms of Caffeine? (looking for probably 150-250mg+ per cup or 8-10 oz or whatever a normal size cup/mug of coffee is) **PLEASE RECOMMEND A COFFEE BRAND I CAN LOOK AT PURCHASING IF POSSIBLE.**

3.) Which type of machine should i buy to make the coffee? I'm looking to make normal cups of coffee at home, nothing fancy. I'm not interested in any frothing / milk addition, no espresso... just a normal cup of coffee to add my own creamer/sugar as needed. With that in mind, do I look for a machine is a ""pour over"" type or a ""drip"" type? (sorry... like i said, I'm new to this whole thing) -- What type of coffee maker should I look into purchasing?

4.) Is it best to grind your own beans, buy pre ground beans, or does it not matter. Are pre ground beans more expensive? If I'm going the route of grinding my own beans, which grinder is good to buy? -- Do I buy pre ground beans or whole beans? If whole, which grinder should I look into? Also, what is the best (cheapest) bang for your buck blend to buy with the highest caffeine content?

5.) Price. I'm not exactly rich so I can't spend $1,000+ dollars on a coffee maker, but I am also willing to spend the money to have a decent piece of equipment. I'd say I wouldn't want to spend more than $400-$500 at most on a machine/maker if possible.



Could anybody recommend: Type of affordable coffee maker, blend of coffee (best caffeine content, around 150mg per cup or more - affordable/cheap), bean grinder if needed. If somebody is able to help with some of these questions, and could give me some recommendations I would be extremely grateful. I look forward to learning/hearing what you all have to say. Thank you.

  
TLDR:  Which machine/brewer should I buy, what is the cheapest/affordable coffee with the a **HIGH** caffeine content (\~150-300mg caffeine per cup/serving), should I buy whole bean or pre blended if whole bean which bean grinder and blend should I buy?",0,1736309866.0,pourover,1,0.33,False
