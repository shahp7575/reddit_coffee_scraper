so I'm an art grad student and it's the middle of the semester right now. 3 weeks ago I dislocated my shoulder and couldn't do any studio work (painting, drawing) for a week. im taking 3 studio classes that require 6-8 hrs work a day on a normal basis.  I had communicated with all of my professors with documentation and they all daid to catch up when possible. I received an email late a week ago today saying my professors gave me a deadline to get caught up with late work by this coming Monday and also be able to submit current work tha5 is due on Tuesday. I have been working in the studio for 15++++hrs each day staying up until 3 or 4 then getting up grabbing coffee then sgraight to working  with  2 10 min breaks and 15-20 for lunch, since last Sunday to try to get caught up.  The work load of art grad students is a lot, and the mental work load is a lot more than most people think because it's art.  I've told my husband and daughter that i need them to take care of things, that is I can only eat, sleep, and work if im going to make these deadlines. (i know my work load isn't sustainable it's just until Tues). he gets stressed from work which i get. The teen has been utter chaos emotionally and not doing what she should be doing. Husband has also been going to bed really early (I understand he is tired but...), which is usually when I discover something that has to b3 addressed with the teen and it escalates. . I've had to do some chores that they were supposed to do but I they didn't, it still needed done so I had to do it (catbox wad really bad, dirty dishes at lead5 need rinsed because we hav3 a cat that likes to lick pans to get the food)..... same with dinner, it gets to the point where it's either it won't get cooked if I don't make something, or Im asked to do it. I've never had to work this hard in my life. I'm so stressed. If I don't meet the deadline I get an F and then I'm kicked out of the program. 

I did implode and told husband I need him to do more.  He said I need to tell him what to do. My first reaction is I shouldn't have to tell you, that I've told you I need both of you to take care of everything. that includes cooking, cleaning, dealing with the teen. It felt like everything I said was thrown in my face. he said he understands I'm stressed and had just been taking my moodiness. That he has been working since he was 18 so he understands and needs me to communicate better.       ....I had already said I needed them to step up. I have said many times that I'm just trying to survive this mentally and physically.  feel like my whole life is falling apart. When he worked 12 hrs shifts I tried to get what he needed done, handled mom duties, so that he could eat, stay up for an hour then sleep. We did that for years before he got into management. It wasn't perfect but I made sure what he really needed  was done.

I did tear up a drawing. It needed to be redone anyway it looked bad because My brain isn't really functioning and the professorof that class would not have accepted it looking the way it did.

I just needed to be anywhere but where I was and didn't want to talk so after I imploded and they went to bed (which was right after argument). I went for a drive after turning my location off.

am I over reacting? 

I just want to quit school right now. I am balling because this is my last chance to go to school for this financially, I feel like I'm hurting my family. ",2,1760184709.0,TwoHotTakes,2,1.0,False

I will be purchasing the 5080 variants.

* Alienware - Great aesthetics, especially the glass window and the new color. Great cooling that ensures good performance. However, it weighs way too much at 3.6kg MORE THAN 18INCH LAPTOPS. It is also very thick, almost 30mm.
* Legion Pro 7i - Much thiner and lighter than the Alienware, has good build quality and overall a great laptop. Just not too keen on the glossy OLED display because of the reflections and the potential burn-ins.
* ROG - Another solid option, with the Mini LED display. However, I don't like the maximalist approach with the LED grid and surround RGB lighting, feels overwhelming.

I don't need the laptop to be too portable, but it still needs to be carried around to the office and places like coffee shops. The laptop will always be used on a desk. With black friday around the corner, I can grab one of these three laptops for a good price.

Part 1: The Origin Story - Forging a Coder in the Grow Room

My journey into the world of code began nearly a decade ago. It didn't start in a classroom or a cubicle, but in a small town, in a small state, where technology often feels a step behind the more populated areas of the world. It started in a grow room, with an $800 problem. This was an era when the ""Internet of Things"" was just starting to feel less like science fiction and more like a catalog you could order from. For a hobbyist cannabis grower, this meant a new level of automation was possible.

A friend of mine‚Äîa brilliant hardware engineer by trade whom I've known for over a decade‚Äîhad just installed the crown jewel of this new era: a Trolmaster. Our friendship itself was born from a different kind of craftsmanship. By trade, I was a master carpenter, and he had first hired me to replace a single window. What developed from that one job, and a gained respect for my work, turned into a full home remodel and a lasting bond. His world of engineering and my world of building collided in our conversations, and through them, a dream I had packed away after high school was rekindled: to become a game programmer. Technology had always been my true passion, an insatiable hunger for knowledge that circumstances had forced me to set aside.

The Trolmaster wasn't just a gadget I couldn't afford; it was a challenge that spoke directly to that reawakened fire. I couldn't afford the tool. But I was broke, not broken. A stubborn thought took root: ""How hard could it be to build one myself?"".

That question kicked me headfirst down a rabbit hole lined with GitHub repositories and tangled wires. My methods were grueling. I wasn't writing code from scratch; I was painstakingly reverse-engineering success. I‚Äôd find example code from libraries, modify it to fit my project, and then follow the cryptic compiler errors down a maze of forums, searching for solutions. My environmental controller project was a testament to this old workflow; a project that a programmer with fundamental knowledge could build in a couple of days took me weeks of relentless, frustrating effort. I was a complete infant in this world, armed with nothing but a dial-up-speed understanding and a stubborn refusal to fail. Yet, through this slow-motion struggle, I started seeing patterns in the syntax, rhythms in the logic. I was beginning to understand code without actually knowing how to code.

Driven by that rekindled passion, I bought a cheap microcontroller and an LED and cobbled together a sketch to make it blink. In that single flash, all makers and tinkerers alike know the feeling, I was hooked. That single blink unleashed a torrent of obsession. Sleep became a suggestion, a nuisance that got in the way of the next breakthrough. Fueled by coffee and that insatiable hunger, I became a ghost in my own home. For weeks on end, my PC screen was my reality as I pushed onward through sleepless nights, trying to feed the addiction. My project grew from that simple light into a sprawling ecosystem of sensors and relays‚Äîa beautiful mess of wires and solder. My friend, intrigued by my manic progress, became my biggest supporter, his curiosity in my project led him to purchase me my own Trolmaster controller to test my diy build against. The results shocked us both. My DIY controller wasn't just accurate; it was better, with robust data logging and trend analysis the commercial product lacked.

This initial project, born from a stubborn refusal to accept limitations, became the foundation of a deep and persistent collaboration between us. The grueling process had taught me how to learn and what I was capable of. I had discovered a superpower, but I hadn't yet found a way to truly amplify it.

Part 2: My New Partner, The Forgetful Genius

The superpower I had discovered through sheer force of will felt slow and brutal. Then, the world changed. AI exploded into the public consciousness, and I saw the tool that promised to match the speed of my curiosity. The initial ""WOW"" effect was pure magic. Complex projects that had been theoretical doodles suddenly seemed possible. But the magic quickly gave way to a brutal reality.

My new partner was a genius with severe short-term memory loss. It was a forgetful, unreliable junior dev who had aced the interview but couldn't be left unsupervised. The context windows were tiny, and every session was a cold start. To build anything, I first had to become an AI Wrangler. The answer came through brute-force creativity. I began treating the AI not as a partner, but as a stateless tool that needed to be re-initialized every single time. This evolved into my first workflow: a ""magic phrase"" to trigger a project summary and a two-chat system‚Äîone for the ""Build Session"" and one for the ""Debug Session""‚Äîto keep the AI from confusing new features with bug fixes.

As our projects grew more complex, so did the AI's flaws. It wasn't just forgetful; it was fallible, confidently suggesting hallucinated libraries or flawed logic. This forced me to evolve my methods into a painstaking, multi-instance workflow. At its peak, one primary ""build"" session would be supported by up to nine separate ""debug"" instances. I would have the AI code a feature in one window, then copy it to a fresh instance and order it to review its own work for errors. I had separate sessions running simultaneously to debug compiler errors versus logical errors, all to prevent cross-contamination and insulate the core project from the AI's own potential for chaos.

This hard-won success gave me the confidence to aim higher. That's when I saw the Flipper Zero. To my wife, it was a ""$300 Tamagotchi for nerds,"" but to me, it was a key to a locked room, sparking a nostalgia for my teenage years fumbling with keyloggers in AOL chats. My initial thoughts were purely mischievous, until my wife asked a simple, project-altering question: ""Is what you are doing even legal?"". Her words hit me with the force of an epiphany, forcing me to confront a critical choice: was I creating a weapon or a shield? The project pivoted. The new goal wasn't to attack, but to defend. This was the true birth of the ""Wifiknight,"" a cybersecurity tool born from a moral choice. Building it required testing against my own network, a process that once led to me accidentally taking my entire home offline overnight‚Äîa humbling and powerful lesson in responsible creation. Through it all, something incredible happened. In this grueling process, we trained each other to be better. The proof is in the portfolio: together, this human-AI team has successfully built 167 distinct coding projects and worked with over 600 different libraries. I had tamed the genius.

Part 3: The Philosophy - Building a Better Builder

My workflow had turned a lifelong curiosity into a powerful tool for empowerment, effectively becoming my own personal R&D department. But I was now the bottleneck. I could build complex things, but my fundamental knowledge was lagging. I was hitting a new kind of wall. I knew the what, but I was missing the deeper why.

The biggest challenge was realizing the AI remembered what we did, but never why. It could recall the library we used, but not the week-long debugging session that led us to choose it over three others that caused critical conflicts. This failure to persist the reasoning‚Äîthe pragmatic, causal memory‚Äîis the soul of a project, and its absence was the source of my most frustrating roadblocks.

The critics of this new way of working fear it creates coders who can assemble but not comprehend. Standing at this crossroads, I realized they were half-right. The danger was real. But the solution wasn't to abandon the tool; it was to turn it back on myself. So I began my most ambitious project yet: to build a better builder.

Using the same collaborative workflow, I tasked my AI with becoming my personal tutor. ""Take these comprehensive guides on C++, Python, and Linux,"" I instructed, ""and structure them. Create a curriculum for me. Test me."" The AI organized a logical learning path, but the real breakthrough came when I asked it to solve the great paradox of learning: how do you learn what you don't know you need to learn? It analyzed the curriculum and identified the ""unknown unknowns,"" weaving them into my plan.

This became the ultimate answer to the critics. I was using the very tool they feared to systematically build the fundamental knowledge they claimed ""vibe coders"" lack. This isn't a shortcut; it's an accelerator for those with the discipline to pursue it. It brings me to my core belief: AI is a tool, as simple and as profound as a hammer. The quality doesn't lie in the tool, but in the builder. In the hands of a craftsman who respects structural integrity, it builds things that stand the test of time.

With great power comes great responsibility. My journey has taught me that this clich√© is the absolute bedrock of the new AI-powered world. The AI can write the lines, but you have to be the architect, the engineer, and the final inspector. You have to want to build something that lasts.

Full Disclosure

This article was written in collaboration with an AI. Every story, experience, and technical detail recounted here is my own, drawn from my personal life. I provided the raw material, built the narrative, and directed the entire writing process. The AI‚Äôs role was that of a scribe, a dictionary, and a thesaurus‚Äîa tool to help transform my journal entries and scattered thoughts into a well-written story that could speak to a wider audience. This piece is the result of a meticulous editing process, refined over multiple iterations and chat sessions to ensure the tone and words are uniquely and authentically mine. The use of AI does not make this story less true; it simply helped me tell it better.

1o3twr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/filmmaking/comments/1o3twr3/starting_cheat_sheet/,Starting - cheat sheet,"I've seen quite a few posts here asking for beginner advice. Figured I would make a cheat sheet with the basics to get you started! Keeping it short concise - comment anything you're unsure on and I'll expand.

This is coming from the perspective of a director with a background in cinematography.

**Is my camera or my lens more important?**

You will see a bigger difference upgrading your lens than you will upgrading your camera. Chances are if you have to even ask yourself ""do I need to upgrade"" you don't. When you do you'll know exactly why.

**What should I spend money on?**

Lighting will make the biggest difference to how your video looks, audio (ie microphones) will make the biggest difference to how your video feels.

I would recommend buying a cheapish LED Panel if you're on a budget, or maybe an Amaran 150c if you have a bit of a budget and experimenting (I'm not a gaffer - don't come after me if a 150c isn't the perfect starting light). Likewise Get a cheapish rode mic and an Artlist subscription and you're pretty much set. No I'm not sponsored - I've just been using them for a few years and have no plans on stopping.

**Whats the best editing software?**

Davinci Resolve is free and has literally everything you could possibly need as a beginner, intermediate and professional.

Premiere Pro is great and a really useful skill to have if you want to go into editing as a job (only because its so widely used - not because I think its better than Davinci).

If you've heard of Avid - no you haven't. Don't worry about it.

**What should I make a film about?**

Literally anything. Whilst you're starting out make a grammatically correct sequence and focus on the process more than the product. Here's some 60 second ideas if you're stuck;

\- Documentary style explanation of making a coffee

\- News report on a local shop opening

\- Argument between two people about who's turn it is to make dinner

Again, the product is completely irrelevant. Focus on the process.

**Should I post stuff on social media?**

Yes.

You can be the best filmmaker in the world, but unless there are people watching your films, it doesn't matter. You don't need to be super active and engage loads - but at the very least its a space for you to build a portfolio you can show to people - or even keep as a diary to track your progress.

p.s If you want client work, they're going to want to see evidence of what you can do.

**How much money can I make as a filmmaker?**

More than you can possibly spend. That being said you won't reach even the low paying gigs if you're doing it purely for the money. It will take a lot of invested love, passion, time and money before you get anywhere close to making that money back.

If you truly love filmmaking as an art rather than a business then I wouldn't worry about making lots of money - it will happen in good time.

**My results are rubbish, what should I do?**

Carry on making rubbish results. You never stop making rubbish films, it's just your standard of good will keep getting higher. I'm years into my journey and I look at my films all the time and think it's rubbish. Of course if I showed that same 'rubbish' to my 16 year old self I would probably be gob smacked.

Under no circumstances stop making rubbish films. Just keep filming. It will work out.

1. Shooting the fire extinguisher 4 times with the default M2010 ESR sniper rifle, or 15 times with the default M433 assault rifle will make it explode.

2. When a bullet is fired into a penetrable object such as a chair back or vending machine glass, it leaves an impact hole in both the object and a second impact hole in whatever is beyond the object, such as the floor or the back wall of said vending machine.

3. A can of soda targeted at an angle takes 4-5 shots with an assault rifle to destroy, and is knocked about in the process usually, but firing at a dead on and level angle will detonate it in one single shot.

4. The music can be disabled by shooting the music speaker in the range, which can be destroyed in one or two shots, and sits on a table by a white coffee mug and teal soda can. This is recommended, as the whistling will drive you insane.

5. Damage dealt to the firing range room or items in it is not reversed until the Battlefield 6 game has been completely quit/closed and rebooted. Simply exiting the room, switching to a different loadout and returning, or exiting out to the main menu does not reset the room.

# Snowmobile clubs find stomach quickest way to landowner‚Äôs heart

By JOHN ENIGL

Jocko Rader once told me he used to hate to see winter come until the snowmobile came along. Many others would echo his comment that the sport gave him something to do in the winter. But when active participation in it is several months off, why rush the season by talking about the sport now?

To begin with, this story is not so much about snowmobiling as it is about appreciation and respect, and the effect of these two traits on people; about how two local organizations have used these traits to keep the Door County snowmobile trails open, and about how the hobby came to be in the first place.

Snowmobiling isn‚Äôt new to Door County. Many people remember Bub LeMere, who delivered mail in the Egg Harbor area with his Model ‚ÄúA‚Äù Ford snowmobile. The machine was constructed from a nearly new automobile, fitted with tracks in the back and skis in the front. In front of each rear wheel was a single ‚Äúbogie‚Äù (or dead axle) wheel, over which the endless track ran. This enabled the track to spread the weight of the machine over a wide area, so it wouldn‚Äôt sink into the snow.

John Carmody, a Carlsville farmer, still remembers LeMere‚Äôs machine, ‚ÄúSailing over the snow drifts, as nice as you please!‚Äù The machine was used until the winter of 1935-1936.

By that time, largely through the efforts of the lake Door County Highway Commissioner Russ Bieri, snow removal equipment had been purchased by the county that could clear the roads as well las they are cleared today. LeMere‚Äôs snowmobile went into storage in Herman Birnschein‚Äôs garage in Egg Harbor, for no farmer would allow cutting his fences just to allow the machine to go through. And you couldn‚Äôt use it on the highways!

There‚Äôs an interesting story about that machine‚Äôs origin, and its final disposition. In this paper‚Äôs ‚ÄúTraveling Back‚Äù section some months ago there was a story from about 50 years ago about the late Gerald Carmody of Carlsville wrecking a new Ford roadster. His wife showed me a picture of the vehicle recently, taken before the wreck.

Well, that demolished vehicle was used, along with a conversion kit, (I believe it was a Snow Flyer from New Holstein) to build LeMere‚Äôs snowmobile. He‚Äôd studied many designs and chose what he considered the best. Model A‚Äôs and T‚Äôs were recommended for the conversion.

I asked Harvey Haen, Egg Harbor‚Äôs master mechanic, inventor, and former fire chief, what happened to the machine. I had heard it was lost when Birnschein‚Äôs garage burned in October 1947. ‚ÄúNo, funny thing about that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt burn. The snowmobile and another vehicle were standing alongside a wall and except for the tires they weren‚Äôt damaged at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúClayton Moegenburg bought it and hauled it home and I don‚Äôt know what happened to it after that.‚Äù

There wasn‚Äôt a \[large amount\] of interest in snowmobiles in 1947, but at least someone saw fit to save it.

I called Moegenburg and he told me that Dennis Hickey, of Baileys Harbor now owned the machine and he had restored it to new condition.

Then I recalled an Advocate feature about the LeMere-Hickey snowmobile from the middle 1960‚Äôs, when snowmobiling came back to life. The vehicle can still ‚Äúsail over the snow,‚Äù as it did long ago.

But a different kind of snowmobile, one relating to the theme of appreciation and respect, had existed all those years, one that was small enough to travel the fields and trails.

That machine was the Eliason, developed by Carl Eliason, (who is still living and active), in 1927.

Eliason lived near Sayner, Wis., if my memory serves me right. An early picture shows four hunters on a prototype machine. The machine looked much like a toboggan with a place cut out for the track in the rear. A water cooled Johnson outboard engine graced the front.

Four Wheel Drive Corp. of Clintonville acquired the rights to build the machine and built it continuously until 1962. Hundreds were ordered and built for the defense of Alaska in World War II.

(W.F. Marceil, who lives at 4306 Peterson Road, was one of the F.W.D. employees who got a ride on one of those early machines, so he probably rates as Door county‚Äôs earliest modern snowmobiler.)

There was even a plan to build Eliasons for the invasion of Norway, to destroy Hitler‚Äôs heavy water ( \[for an\] atomic bomb) factories. But the machine was not advanced enough at that time. The engine exhaust couldn‚Äôt be muffled down enough so the attackers would not be given away. (A few years ago, engine exhaust was still an annoyance to snowmobilers and non-snowmobilers alike.)

One of the many post-World War II movies has a line in it by one of the actors volunteering for the heavy water plant destruction, referring to ‚Äúsome advanced type of machine you‚Äôre going to use to cross the mountains to get to the heavy water plants.‚Äù But the plants were destroyed, finally, not by snowmobilers, but by paratroops.

Later Eliasons of the ‚Äò50‚Äôs were two, instead of four, passenger machines and had four-cycle Briggs and Stratton engines in the rear. They were not ‚Äúpeppy‚Äù machines, for they did not ‚Äúrev up‚Äù as fast as today‚Äôs two-cycle machines.

In 1962, the F.W.D. Corporation decided there was no future in snowmobiles and discontinued production.

But the Eliason design had been closely observed and appreciated by the Hetteen brothers in Rosseau, Minn. They built a snowmobile that was almost identical to the last Eliasons and named it the **Polaris** ‚Äî now that‚Äôs a name you‚Äôve heard! And one of the Hetteen boys broke away and started building another make you‚Äôve also heard of, the **Arctic Cat**.

As Paul Harbey says, ‚ÄúNow you know the rest of the story.‚Äù What was worth nothing to one company became the start of something great.

(Don Juleen and I were driving to South Milwaukee one day in July. We saw a trailer with one each of the early Polaris and Arctic Cat models, looking very much like the orphaned Eliason, perhaps headed for an antique show.)

But the Eliason had a contemporary competitor toward the last. Bombardier, a Canadian, had built enclosed snowmobiles with automobile engines since the ‚Äô20‚Äôs. A Ford 60 horsepower engine powered those he sold to the Allies in World War II.

When he finally came out with a two-man vehicle in 1959, he gave it to a backwoods priest he knew and told him to ‚Äútry it out under the toughest conditions you meet and let me know how it works!‚Äù

Thus the Skidoo was born. The name was changed from Ski Dog, because, translated into French, the name doesn‚Äôt sound right. (I understand it is downright uncouth.)

I suppose everyone knows how the hobby has grown, mostly in the last 10 years. The first snowmobile I saw was in 1966, a Johnson. One of my pupils drove it across the athletic field from his home to our school.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll bet one of these days they won‚Äôt let you drive them all over the city, and you might have to license them,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôll never happen,‚Äù the boy said.

Well, it did happen; not only do you have to license them but there are DNR and Department of Transportation rules about where they can be driven, and restrictions as to age.

The machines increased in speed and horsepower and misuse, resulting in annoyance to the public and some fatalities began to occur. The snowmobiler could not drive on the highway; he soon became tired of driving on his own land; he therefore had to encroach on the land of others to fulfill his hobby.

How, then, does it happen that there is almost a complete lack of complaints against snowmobilers in Door County; a silence, or either favorable, or ‚Äúlive and let live,‚Äù attitude on the part of landowners? Let‚Äôs see what led up to that condition.

The first snowmobile that came on our land belonged to Alton Krueger, who was out delivering Christmas presents which he was giving to his customers.

I suppose some day I‚Äôll have to ask if I can drive over your land,‚Äù Alton said. I told him it would be OK; I was getting interested in a snowmobile myself and might want to drive over his land too.

Several years later Krueger told me, ‚ÄúThe snowmobile gave me something I could do with my son. I‚Äôm not interested in sports or hobbies, and this is one thing we can do together.

So it was for many people. They finally had a family hobby.

Not too many years after the sport started to get popular in Door County, someone stopped to ask permission to run a trail across our land. By that time I had bought a snowmobile so I thought it would be pretty convenient to have a trail so close by. I readily gave permission. I didn‚Äôt ask too many questions, because I figured I could put up with a little damage or littering to have the trail located where I could use it. Non-snowmobiling landowners probably had more questions, such as ‚Äúwho‚Äôs going to clean up? and ‚Äúwhat if someone gets hurt on my land?‚Äù

The snowmobile season came and went, with our family getting good use from the trail.

In the spring, everything along the trail was cleaned up so there was little sign there had been a trail there, except for some uncut grass being pressed down. We forgot about snowmobiling.

Then, along in May, we received a card from the Egg Harbor Men‚Äôs Club inviting us to a fish boil. We hadn‚Äôt really paid too much attention to the name of the organization sponsoring the snowmobile trail. From the card we learned that the club wanted to show its appreciation for the use of our land for the trail.

Well, just about anyone who has ever been to Door County knows what a treat a fish boil is. The whole family was invited, of course, and that time we had six children at home. So it was always a treat to be invited out to dinner; especially for Mother, who enjoys a respite from her seven-day-a-week cooking chores.

The Sunday of the snowmobile landowners fish boil arrived and we joined the crowd at the Egg Harbor village grounds. That first fish boil was held in the basement of the old village school, since demolished. Later ones have been held in the new fire hall.

Incidentally, the landowner‚Äôs fish boil was the first fish boil I ever attended, because, with our large family, we couldn‚Äôt afford to go to one before.

As we lined up for the meal we could smell the treat arranged for us. There were steaming kettles of whole potatoes, boiled along with the fish, with the skins on. Boiled onions were to be seen in other kettles. All sorts of relishes, prepared by Men‚Äôs club members and snowmobiler‚Äôs wives, awaited us. Coffee was available, and the beer keg stood not far away. And, of course, there was the piece-de-resistance, the boiled trout, bound to turn any non-fish eater into a believer.

Just as enjoyable as the good meals are at these snowmobile landowners gatherings is the fellowship. One is reminded of those days that ended, for most of us, in the early ‚Äô50‚Äôs ‚Äî the days when farmers traded labor to get the threshing and silo filling done. In those days, it seems, we used to get together more often and there was always a big meal connected with those events. The combine and the chopper put an end to that form of fellowship.

True, today we think nothing of attending someone else‚Äôs church‚Äôs fundraising bazaar or dinner, or an event put on by someone else‚Äôs organization. But we don‚Äôt often get the members of the local community together. And, because of the length of the trails, the slice of the community represented at the snowmobile gatherings stretches from Egg Harbor to Carlsville, or Egg Harbor to Sturgeon Bay, depending on which club‚Äôs get-together you‚Äôre attending.

As we sat down to eat at that first landowners‚Äô fish boil we were surrounded by people we knew, but hadn‚Äôt seen, in some cases, for many years. We stayed a long time after the meal, renewing old acquaintances.

When I asked Harvey Haen, Egg Harbor‚Äôs legendary inventor and president of the Men‚Äôs Club, for information about how the landowners‚Äô fish boil got started, he didn‚Äôt want to take much of the credit.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just something the Men‚Äôs Club took on as a responsibility to help a good relationship between the snowmobilers and the people whose land they travel over. The Men‚Äôs Club started off in the 1930‚Äôs as a group of guys who wanted to get together to have a little fun. But it has turned into an organization that takes on all sorts of community responsibilities and this is one of them. Both Men‚Äôs Club members and snowmobilers put on this event.‚Äù

It was typical of Haen to underplay the part of leadership he has held in the Egg Harbor community. His able assistants at boiling the fish, Chuck Richards, Orin LeMere, Emil Volkmann, and Bill Sawyer, didn‚Äôt want to claim responsibility for the success of the event either, but they certainly helped create a lot of good will.

Treating landowners was pioneered by the Sturgeon Bay Winter Sports Club in the Sturgeon Bay area in the early days of the sport and the Door Pioneer Trail Blazers Snowmobile Club also show their appreciation to the landowners with a picnic each year.

Here, again, no one wants to claim credit for the event, but over the years, certain members seem to stand out. One such snowmobiler is Bob Naumann.

‚ÄúWe try not to miss inviting any landowner over whose land we ride. Sometimes there‚Äôs a question if the trail actually goes over a person‚Äôs land, but we invite them anyway. We don‚Äôt want to miss anyone.‚Äù

[The Door Pioneer Trail Blazers Snowmobile Club hosted a picnic for landowners at Sunset Park in July. Pictured left to right are Oscar Wagner, Bill Kiehnau, George LaPlant, Ed Demeuse, Frank Mosgaller, Charles Niemayer, John Mosgaller and Joe Kuehn.](https://preview.redd.it/tec4yei8bguf1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=d53d1cf34f5d55181358c8e7be249558de687906)

Elton Sternard, once a snowmobile dealer and now just an enthusiast, is another person who has devoted a good deal of time to the public relations aspect of snowmobiling.

The club‚Äôs 1978-1979 president, Tom Smith, is just as enthusiastic about this important phase of the hobby.

Naumann, Sternard and Smith and the other club members mingled with the landowners at this year‚Äôs picnic at Sunset Park. The landowners got to know the type of people that travel over their land ‚Äî an important factor in helping them decide to give permission for their land to be part of the trail.

Here, again, it was an event that got together people who don‚Äôt see each other very often.

In this day when everyone is getting more possessive of what is his and more suspicious of those who want to go onto their property, these two organizations have struck upon a plan to keep the snowmobile trails open. People like to be appreciated, and if you give something in return for a privilege you are showing appreciation.

Even if the snowmobile organizations didn‚Äôt do the excellent job they do in cleaning up after the season, if they slipped once in a while, there probably wouldn‚Äôt be a complaint. Landowners remember those fish boils and picnics and words of appreciation.

Soon the snowmobile club members will be out, again asking permission to lay out a trail. It‚Äôs a good bet that they won‚Äôt be turned down by many people.

As someone who‚Äôs constantly dealing with the ups and downs of a busy household, maintaining pristine floors is almost impossible. Scratches, nicks, and annoying stains appear faster than I can keep up, especially with kids, pets, and general daily hustle. Enter the KARIDGE 8RMP-001 Vinyl Floor Repair Kit, a game-changer I encountered in this perpetual battle. This repair kit has been making rounds in conversations among DIY enthusiasts, and I was curious to see if it truly delivers the prowess it promises.  

It turns out, giving this repair kit a spin was a satisfying endeavor, especially considering the frustrations I‚Äôve had with other products in the past. At the same time, it wasn‚Äôt perfect, and there are a few points worth noting to make an informed decision.  

**Design and Build of the Kit**  

The kit comes neatly packaged in a compact box, accommodating 11 hard wax strips in a variety of tones, eight furniture repair markers, a heat pen, and additional tools like a scraper. Its compact shape ensures easy storage amidst my cluttered repair shelf. While the design is practical, the heat pen caught my attention immediately. Unlike others I‚Äôve used before, this heat pen doesn‚Äôt require constant button pressing to stay warm. With a simple switch from ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù to ‚ÄúON,‚Äù the pen stays hot, making it genuinely convenient during longer repair sessions.  

Though functional, I did find the plastic material of the heat pen slightly less durable than expected. For a product designed for frequent use, having a more robust build here would have been a nice touch‚Äîespecially when you‚Äôre playing tug-of-war with fixes for scratches that mysteriously multiply every week.  

**Ease of Application ‚Äì Does It Simplify DIY Repairs?**  

Using the repair kit turned out to be relatively straightforward, especially for someone who has completed a fair share of furniture fixes. I started with one of the wax bars, carefully matching the tone based on the furniture scratch I was repairing. 11 colors offer great flexibility for virtually all types of flooring, from laminate to vinyl and even wood furniture‚Äîblending colors and creating shades where needed feels intuitive, though it does take a bit of experimenting at first.  

The heat-up process with the pen was quicker than I expected, taking about 10-20 seconds, and it melted the wax efficiently without any annoying interruptions. As someone who often deals with rushed fixes post-coffee spills or my pet‚Äôs claw marks, every minute saved on tasks like these counts. The provided scraper worked well for smoothing out the wax, but I realized you need a light touch to avoid unintentionally removing a little too much and creating dips that are visible under certain lighting.  

[Click here to find KARIDGE 8RMP-001 on Amazon.](https://app.womanreview.com/p/b0bvvsvmqk/)  

**Boons of the Product**  

- The variety of colors is genuinely impressive. Having 11 wax tones and matching markers allows you to recreate pretty much any finish, and if not, blending works like a charm.  
- The non-stop heating function of the pen cuts down on effort and makes it beginner-friendly.  
- Repairs were smoother compared to using wood putty or fillers that I‚Äôve struggled with in the past.  
- Durability was a pleasant surprise; the wax hardened well and resisted abrasion, even when tested under heavier foot traffic.  

**Drawbacks to Consider**  

- The heat pen feels a little lightweight and might not withstand regular drops or prolonged wear.  
- Matching colors perfectly requires patience, especially when working on intricate materials like vinyl or linoleum with textured patterns.  
- Batteries are not included in the kit, which was a little inconvenient when I was excited to try it out immediately. Make sure you have AAA batteries lying around before starting.  
- A more detailed instruction manual could help first-timers who might struggle with the ‚Äúmixing to match tones‚Äù aspect.  

**Competing Products to Explore**  

While the KARIDGE kit is stellar for most residential needs, there are a few competitors worth mentioning. The Minwax Blend-Fil Pencil, for instance, works wonders for minor scratches but doesn‚Äôt offer the comprehensive setup, heat pen, or versatility in materials. For heavy-duty wood restoration, Rejuvenate Restorer Markers provide longer-lasting results, but they lack the diversity of colors and wax options. Comparing these highlights the versatility and DIY ease of this kit, particularly for diverse surfaces like laminate, vinyl, and wood cabinetry. If you‚Äôre someone looking for a more central all-in-one solution, KARIDGE really does stand out in this regard.  

**Worth Every Penny?**  

Discussing cost-effectiveness, the KARIDGE kit seems like a well-rounded product. Laminated floors and wooden furniture sets can quickly show wear and tear, and this kit delivers solid fixes that extend the life of these surfaces‚Äîsaving money in the long run by skipping professional repairs. Given its user-friendly features and diverse color scheme, it feels like a quality investment for most homeowners juggling various surface types. However, for budget-conscious individuals who occasionally need minor touch-ups, simpler options without heat pens might suffice.

I had the opportunity to use this powerhouse for a few weeks, and if you‚Äôre someone who juggles tasks like video editing, heavy browsing with multiple tabs, or coding‚Äîall from the comfort of a workspace smaller than most coffee tables‚Äîthis desktop deserves a closer look. It‚Äôs impressively small, weighing just over 3 pounds and packing dimensions of under 7 inches in length and width. Yet, it doesn‚Äôt compromise on the power you‚Äôd expect from business-class computing.  

**Performance and Speed**  
What truly stands out is the 14th Gen Intel Core i5-14500 processor. The mix of six high-performance cores and eight efficiency cores meant I could easily run complex applications without my workflow grinding to a halt. Running performance-heavy tasks, like editing 4K videos while downloading large files in the background, was effortless. Thanks to its 32GB DDR5 memory, multitasking genuinely matched the speed I needed and elevated my productivity. I've also noticed seamless responsiveness when toggling between dozens of tabs and software applications. For professionals managing intensive projects, such speed is an undeniable asset.  

**Graphics and Displays**  
Prepare to be impressed if you're someone like me who demands more visual real estate. With Intel UHD 770 Graphics paired with two DisplayPorts and an HDMI port, hooking up three displays felt as straightforward as plugging in a USB drive. Running high-res content on multiple screens was smooth, with no annoying lag, tearing, or stuttering, even when handling graphics-heavy interfaces. Whether for presentations, stock trading, or just boosting efficiency with multiple monitors, the visuals are clean, sharp, and vibrant.  

**Advantages**  
- Compact size that fits even in tight office spaces or mounts behind monitors.  
- Superb multitasking power with 14 cores and 32GB DDR5 RAM.  
- Triple-display support with two DisplayPorts and HDMI for flexible setups.

**Connectivity Options and Ports**  
The variety of connectivity options makes this mini desktop even more versatile. It was a relief not to constantly unplug one device to connect another. The front panel alone offers USB Type-A ports, a lightning-fast USB Type-C, and a headphone jack, making peripherals easily swappable without fumbling behind the unit. Meanwhile, the rear ports include an RJ-45 Ethernet connector for stable wired internet connections, three more USB Type-A ports, and the video output trio I mentioned earlier. Adding Wi-Fi 6 into the mix, web connectivity was fast, reliable, and prepared for the latest tech. Bluetooth 5.2 compatibility made using wireless keyboards, mice, and earphones hassle-free‚Äîa definite modern convenience.  

**Design and Practicality**  
Despite its ridiculously compact size, it doesn‚Äôt feel like some fragile tech toy. The mini-desktop is solidly built to sit horizontally or mount vertically. I particularly loved its flexibility; I mounted it behind my monitor to free up desk space completely. If you‚Äôre working in a small apartment or on the move often for hot-desking, this ability to almost vanish into your workspace is a game-changer. Those looking for portability will also appreciate that the HP 800 G9 weighs just over three pounds‚Äîlight enough to toss into larger bags or travel cases.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The lack of an optical drive may be inconvenient for users still reliant on CDs or DVDs.  
- Not ideal for hardcore gaming; the integrated graphics limit its ability beyond moderate graphical workloads.  
- Limited to 1TB internal storage, which may require additional external drives sooner for heavy data users.  

**Competing Products**  
To understand how it stacks up, I tested it side by side with devices like the Lenovo ThinkCentre M90n and the Dell OptiPlex 7090 Micro. Here‚Äôs where the HP 800 G9 distinguishes itself: its balance between size, performance, and advanced connectivity. While Lenovo's mini-desktops are comparable in compactness, they lack the sheer power offered by the 14-core i5 processor. The Dell OptiPlex, known for security features and corporate relevance, doesn't quite offer the HDMI + DisplayPort combo that you‚Äôll need for popular multi-screen setups. The HP model shines brightly for professionals seeking a desktop that blends raw processing power with convenience.  

**Value for Money**  
Mini PCs often find themselves at a crossroads of affordability and capability. The HP 800 G9 manages to sit at a sweet spot; it‚Äôs undoubtedly an investment, but its impressive specs justify the cost. For office setups, minimalists, or professionals operating within space constraints, the compact powerhouse more than earns its own retail worth. The inclusion of a wired keyboard and mouse, while basic, adds immediate functionality, but serious users (like myself) will eventually upgrade those. The VESA mounting potential is yet another bonus that makes it versatile across various work setups.

He was five years old on that first trip (the youngest most outfitters allow), and we had no idea what to expect.

That day changed everything.
We caught fish, a lot of them.

Since then, we‚Äôve had multiple double-digit days, and our best so far was 51 fish landed from the canoe (we don‚Äôt count the ones that get off next to the boat).

The Shenandoah has been our go-to river ever since. It‚Äôs calm, wild, full of life, and gives you the kind of days that make a kid fall in love with fishing.

‚∏ª

Why the Shenandoah Works

The Shenandoah is a forgiving, scenic, and ridiculously fishy river.

Most of the South Fork is gentle Class I water, perfect for beginners and families, and it‚Äôs packed with smallmouth bass and giant sunfish that make anything from a suburban pond look tiny.

It‚Äôs also the kind of place that feels alive. We‚Äôve seen bald eagles on multiple trips, gliding just above the trees, and every once in a while you‚Äôll float past cows standing in the river, cooling off and staring like you‚Äôre the strange one.

It‚Äôs wild and quiet, and it honestly feels like stepping back in time.

Fishing is best from late spring through early fall, when the water‚Äôs warm, clear, and the bass are feeding aggressively.

‚∏ª

Three Floats That Always Produce

Quick note on time:
Outfitters list short float times based on steady paddling.
If you‚Äôre fishing, plan for about one mile per hour.
A ‚Äútwo-hour float‚Äù can easily turn into four or five once the bite turns on, which is exactly how it should be.

‚∏ª

1. Shenandoah Dam ‚Üí Grove Hill (~ 9miles)

If you have a full day, make it this one.

You launch below the Shenandoah Dam. Unload near the dam and the hand launch, then park across the street in the parking lot at Shenandoah Landing Park. From there, it‚Äôs a short walk back to the water. The launch is right next to Shenandoah River Adventures, which makes it easy to find.

It‚Äôs about nine miles to the Grove Hill DWR ramp, and it‚Äôs hands-down the best fishing we‚Äôve had on the Shenandoah, with ledges, riffles, current seams, and deep pools loaded with smallmouth and big sunfish.

If you don‚Äôt want to run your own shuttle, Shenandoah River Adventures handles everything for about $65 per day.

‚∏ª

2. Hazard Mill ‚Üí Bentonville (3 miles)

A short, fun float that‚Äôs perfect for kids or a quick morning trip.
Downriver Canoe Company runs it as Trip #1 ‚ÄúHazard Mill.‚Äù

They‚Äôll shuttle you up to the launch (no parking there) and you float right back to DWR ramp in front of their shop in Bentonville.

It‚Äôs a three-mile stretch, but don‚Äôt let that fool you. If you‚Äôre fishing, it‚Äôll take at least three hours or more.

According to the Virginia DWR‚Äôs 2024 electrofishing survey, Hazard Mill had the highest catch rates on the river, about 396 fish per hour.

Those numbers sound wild until you fish it, then you realize they‚Äôre not far off.
Of course, just because biologists can shock that many fish doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll catch that many, but it‚Äôs a great sign of how healthy the population is and where the fish like to hang out.

The sunfish here are absolute tanks, and the smallmouth bite is steady start to finish.

‚∏ª

3. Shenandoah River State Park ‚Üí Karo Landing (5 miles)

This is our usual float since it‚Äôs closest to Northern VA.
Front Royal Outdoors runs it as ‚ÄúHalf-Day State Park #2.‚Äù

You launch from the canoe access inside Shenandoah River State Park and float about five miles to Karo Landing.

It‚Äôs a mellow stretch, so plan for two to three hours paddling or five hours fishing. There are plenty of calm pools, rocky runs, and shaded banks where bass like to hold.

They recommend going when the river‚Äôs above 1.8 feet; any lower and you‚Äôll be scraping rocks.

‚∏ª

üêü What‚Äôs in the Water

If you‚Äôre after smallmouth bass and big sunfish, this river will spoil you.

The 2024 DWR survey (nine sites, 1,919 fish sampled) confirmed what most anglers already know:

Smallmouth Bass (710 caught):Most between 7‚Äì13 in; 26 fish >14 inBest site: Juniors

Largemouth Bass (116 caught):One fish at 21.7 in; 49 fish between 12‚Äì20 inBest size: Juniors | 
Most caught: Merck

Redbreast Sunfish (902 caught):Most between 4‚Äì6 in; 185 fish over 6 inTop site: Hazard Mill (396/hr)

Rock Bass (128 caught):Mostly 4‚Äì6 in; some up to 7+ inBest sites: Hazard Mill, Juniors, Front Royal

Bluegill (24 caught):All under 6 in; best site = Cupps

Muskellunge (3 caught):Largest = 25.8 in (Merck)

Those numbers don‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll catch that many, but they‚Äôre a great indicator of a healthy, consistent fishery and proof you‚Äôre in the right water.

‚∏ª

Our Go-To Baits

You don‚Äôt need a ton of tackle to have a great day on the Shenandoah, just a few confidence baits that always work:

Ned Rigs (for smallmouth)
	‚Ä¢	Z-Man Finesse ShroomZ 1/10 oz (black or green pumpkin)
	‚Ä¢	Z-Man TRD in green pumpkin or PB&J

Work them slow along rocky ledges and seams, they‚Äôll eat it even when the bite‚Äôs slow.

Nikko Hellgrammites (deadly all-around)
	‚Ä¢	Rig on a light jig head or drop-shot near current breaks, eddies, and ledges.

Smallmouth crush these in moving water, and even the big redbreast sunfish will go for them.

Micro Ned Rigs (for sunfish)
	‚Ä¢	Z-Man Micro Finesse ShroomZ 1/20 oz (chartreuse or black)
	‚Ä¢	Z-Man Micro TRD (coppertreuse) or Shad FryZ (smelt)

Perfect for kids, near-guaranteed bites all day.

Rooster Tails (for easy action)
	‚Ä¢	White 1/16 oz; simple, visible, and catches everything that swims.

Rapala Silver Floating Minnow (#7)
	‚Ä¢	Great for working deeper pools or when smallmouth are chasing baitfish.

Throw it upriver and let it drift down, a couple twitches and they hammer it.

Topwater (mornings and evenings)
	‚Ä¢	Whopper Plopper or Pop-R in black or white.

The bite is usually best right at the start of the float, especially early mornings when the fog‚Äôs still on the water.

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è Safety and River Conditions

A few things I‚Äôve learned, some the easy way, some the hard way:
	‚Ä¢	Always check river levels before you go. Each outfitter posts daily water conditions showing when it‚Äôs too high (dangerous), too low (you‚Äôll drag constantly), or ideal.
	‚Ä¢	Wear your life vest every time.
	‚Ä¢	Only take your kid if they can swim confidently.
	‚Ä¢	Even in calm water, a canoe can flip if you hit a rock wrong. It happens fast, and it‚Äôs cold.
	‚Ä¢	Bring water, sunscreen, snacks, and a dry bag for your phone.
	‚Ä¢	Pack light; one rod each and a few go-to baits are all you need.

‚∏ª

What We‚Äôve Learned
	‚Ä¢	Expect about one mile per hour when fishing, slow down and enjoy it.
	‚Ä¢	The early-morning bite is best, right when outfitters open.
	‚Ä¢	The further upriver, the better the fishing (the Shenandoah flows north‚Ä¶so go south).
	‚Ä¢	Let your kid net the fish; it‚Äôs chaotic but fun.

‚∏ª

üéß For the Drive Out

If you‚Äôre heading toward the Valley, queue up the ‚ÄúFishing the DMV‚Äù podcast on Spotify. It‚Äôs full of Shenandoah talk, smallmouth tactics, and local interviews.

‚∏ª

We started fishing the Shenandoah because we were tired of getting skunked, and now it‚Äôs where we go when we want a sure thing, strong smallmouth, fat sunfish, eagles overhead, and cows cooling off in the current.

If you‚Äôve been thinking about getting your kid into fishing, this is your sign.

Maybe I‚Äôll see you out there one morning, mist rising, rods bending, and coffee getting cold because the fish won‚Äôt stop biting. ",15,1760183678.0,nova,2,0.94,False

This is a mini-rant about some of these groups of people at my warehouse.

Who knows what they‚Äôre doing, but they are there for long ass periods of time, they make a fucking mess, wander in the way of parking lot traffic, take multiple parking spaces, and it‚Äôs really irritating!

This is new though: if you look close you can see a table set up with snacks and coffee and stacks of cups (and I didn‚Äôt catch it when I snapped the photo as I drove by looking for a parking spot, but there were at least 6 other people in addition to 3 small children hanging out there as well, just congregating at 4 in the morning!)

Nova Minerals (NASDAQ, ASX: NVA) shares soared after the company announced it has secured a land use permit for its proposed antimony refinery in Alaska, placing it another step closer to becoming a key supplier of the critical mineral in the US.

According to a press release issued on Friday, the permit covers 42.81 acres of commercial industrial zoned land near Port MacKenzie (Port Mac), an industrial hub designed as a bulk commodity export facility for industries like mining, and the only port in the state with over 9,000 acres dedicated to commercial and industrial development and growth.

The land use permit, the Australia-based company said, would allow it to establish downstream antimony processing and refining operations in Alaska‚Äôs Mat-Su Borough, an area with ready infrastructure for rapid development. The refinery site at Port Mac is strategically aligned with the fast-progressing West Susitna Access Road and other regional development projects currently underway, it added.

With the permit secured, the company said it is now actively negotiating with the US government on additional funding to build the facility. Earlier this month, Nova Minerals was¬†[awarded $43.4 million](https://www.mining.com/nova-wins-43-4m-pentagon-award-to-build-antimony-hub-shares-skyrocket/)¬†by the US Department of War to support this project.

‚ÄúWith the land use permit secured and the Department of War award, we are rapidly advancing our vision to become the leading US miner and producer of refined antimony products ‚Äî strategic, secure, and proudly made in the USA,‚Äù Nova CEO Christopher Gerteisen stated.

‚ÄúWe are fast-tracking Phase 1 production of military-spec antimony, targeting delivery of our first product to the Department of War within 24 months, underscoring our commitment to supporting critical national defense needs.‚Äù

Nova Minerals‚Äô US-listed shares jumped by more than 10% to an all-time high of $24.86 on the announcement, taking its market capitalization to about $174 million.

# Alaska antimony resource

The proposed refinery represents the next phase of Nova‚Äôs strategy of onshoring US antimony production by building a fully integrated, mine-to-processing production hub in Alaska. Its Port Mac facility is expected to produce a full range of antimony products, including antimony trisulfide, antimony trioxide and antimony metal, used by both the US military and in industrial applications.

Anchoring this strategy is the company‚Äôs district-scale, 10-million-oz. Estelle gold project. Historically, antimony mining in Alaska has been associated with its large gold deposits. The Estelle project is located within the Tintina gold belt known to host significant antimony deposits in the past and was once a supply of the mineral to the North American market.

Nova‚Äôs team has so far identified four large, near-surface gold deposits on the 514 km¬≤ property, and only recently discovered¬†antimony coincident with the gold¬†in surface sampling on numerous prospects, elevating the project‚Äôs status as a critical mineral play that aligns with the Trump administration‚Äôs strategy.

While no resource has yet been established for antimony, the company has said it plans to publish a resource estimate for the critical mineral some time this year.

We have 5 kids ages 8-13. We own everything together. We are a domestic abuse survival couple. The past few years are just.ugghhhh. Everytime I turn around it's something else. A new lie, a new secret, a new addiction, him acting like a child the list is non stop. 

We both work. Since we have gotten together I have gone to college, got my driver's license, gotten 100% sober, and climbed the pay rate. He..idk what time has done for him. To be transparent- he has chronic pancreatitis and diabetes from being an ex-alcoholic. He has had it since our oldest was 2 weeks old. I could go on and on, but lately he's irked TF out of me. He fell asleep, and drove my car into a ditch. Broke my A-frame. He refuses to put my car into the shop. I plan on doing it myself. His truck broke down, bad fuel pump, and his uncle paid for it to be fixed. Mind you, his uncle pays for all major purposes and we re-pay him with interest...I prefer to pay for myself, unless it hinders my children. My husband has no DL. He also, caught his motorcycle on fire while he was driving it while I was at work. I paid $3,500 for that bike, and traded him to get mine. I also, taught him how to fix the trucks suspension. He is not 100% sober, due to medication and mj.

Well, this morning I wake up, and find his mj laid out. I have asked several times for him to keep it put up, because..well..my dang kids-duh. I also find a bottle of sleep meds. At this point he's on like 10 medications. Idk how many, because Ive asked him to get off of a few select meds, due to physical and mental health concerns but he just throws a tantrum. I get real irate, and honestly I gave up. His DR is a spin DR who didn't even notice the cancer that took my MIL. But seeing sleep meds, he doesn't struggle with sleep.

I had to walk home from work this week at 10:30-11p this week while the truck was being fixed...alone. Generally when I get home, he's asleep and I have to get the kids in bed. He won't make them do chores, or homework, so I do it. He does occasionally half-ass clean the house...really it's just sweeping everything into a pile for me to pick up later. He also drinks coffee non-stop. No problem, but he makes it into a huge mess and refuses to clean it up. He just blames his brother, who I dont want living with us. He agreed to this while we were in jail. In jail because - my husband's daughter and bf where jumping him. I tried to break it up, and also got arrested. I had to pay 8k to my lawyer by myself. After I paid his 1.5k off.

I have also, repaired the house by myself. His idea of repair la include just placing a cap on a leaky waterline, adding nails to broken Sheetrock, and putting duct tape on stuff. Granted- the kids tear a lot of stuff up. My repairs are mud and tape, new Sheetrock, and new flooring etc etc.

Everytime I bring this stuff up and ask for a divorce he says ""So there's someone else huh?!?"" There is indeed, nobody else. After this marriage I'd rather not. Men just..haven't been the best to me in my life. (Shout out to the good guys, keep pushing for good stuff).

Like I said. There's a never ending list. But I'm tired. Idk what to do.

I am trying to get satisfactory running on my Linux mint and have run into a few problems, The game keeps freezing at random moments somewhere between starting up or loading into a world. Sometimes it freezes at the first loading screen, sometimes when loading into a world and the furthest I have gotten was a black screen inside the tutorial. In all these cases any audio inside the game will keep playing but the game itself becomes unresponsive and needs to be killed through either steam or the system monitor.

I have tried a number of surface level fixes, from reinstalling to changing the proton version but nothing has really fixed my problem.

1o3tghk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1o3tghk/best_places_to_visit_in_usa_in_july/,Best Places To Visit In Usa In July,"The thermometer hit 92¬∞F when I stepped off the trail at Yellowstone's Grand Prismatic Spring, but I barely noticed. Steam rose from the kaleidoscope pool‚Äîelectric blues bleeding into emerald greens, burnt oranges, and deep yellows‚Äîcreating its own weather system. A family from Texas stood beside me, mouths agape. ""Is this even real?"" the dad asked nobody in particular.

July in America isn't just hot. It's when the country throws open every door, unfurls every trail, and invites you to experience its most dramatic landscapes under skies so blue they hurt to look at. From Alaska's midnight sun illuminating glaciers to Maine's lobster rolls served with ocean views, July is when traveling the USA feels less like checking boxes and more like falling in love.

After spending fifteen Julys crisscrossing this country‚Äîsleeping under stars in Montana, dodging crowds at Acadia, discovering the Oregon Coast's moody magic‚ÄîI've learned something crucial: July travel is about timing, not just destination. Know where to go when, and you'll experience America at its absolute peak. Choose wrong, and you'll spend your vacation in parking lot traffic at 95 degrees.

This guide isn't about the same old ""visit the Grand Canyon"" advice you've read a thousand times. These are the places where July does something special‚Äîwhere wildflowers carpet alpine meadows, where wildlife emerges after winter's sleep, where ocean temperatures finally feel swimmable, and where small-town festivals remind you why summer road trips became an American tradition.

# Why July Is America's Best-Kept Travel Secret

Let me be honest: July gets a bad rap among seasoned travelers. ""Too hot,"" they say. ""Too crowded."" And yes, if you're planning to visit Death Valley or Times Square on July 4th weekend, they're absolutely right.

But here's what those naysayers miss: July is the only month when you can access every corner of America. High mountain roads that stay snowbound until late June finally open. Alaska's famously temperamental weather actually cooperates. National parks from Glacier to Olympic reach their prime, with every hiking trail accessible and wildlife viewing at its peak.

The trade-off? You need to be strategic. Book accommodations two to three months ahead. Arrive at popular spots before 8 AM or after 4 PM. Consider lesser-known alternatives to marquee destinations. Pack patience along with your sunscreen.

During my 2024 July road trip through the Pacific Northwest, I learned that timing beats destination every single time. Olympic National Park's Hoh Rainforest was shoulder-to-shoulder at noon but nearly empty at 7 AM when morning mist still clung to the moss-draped trees. The lesson stuck.

# 1. Glacier National Park, Montana ‚Äî Where Mountains Touch Heaven

The grizzly appeared exactly where my ranger friend said it would‚Äîambling through an alpine meadow so thick with wildflowers it looked painted. I stood on the Going-to-the-Sun Road, that engineering marvel that snakes through the park, and watched through binoculars as the bear paused to sniff the air. Behind him, Hidden Lake sparkled impossibly blue, surrounded by jagged peaks still wearing winter's snow like crowns.

Glacier in July is what dreams of the American West look like. The park's famous road fully opens by early July, unlocking access to some of the most jaw-dropping alpine scenery on the planet. Turquoise lakes reflect granite spires. Mountain goats pose on cliff edges with the confidence of seasoned Instagram influencers. More than 700 lakes dot the landscape, each one seemingly more photogenic than the last.

**What Makes July Special:** All trails are accessible, wildflowers peak at mid-to-high elevations, and wildlife viewing hits its stride. Grizzlies, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, and elk are actively foraging, meaning patient visitors often score incredible sightings.

**The Reality Check:** This is Montana's busiest month. Vehicle reservations for Going-to-the-Sun Road are mandatory and sell out months in advance. The park entrance can see two-hour waits. My advice? Enter through the less-traveled Two Medicine or Many Glacier entrances. Stay overnight in one of the park lodges or nearby towns like Whitefish, where you can grab breakfast at Montana Coffee Traders before beating the crowds to the trails.

**Don't Miss:** The Highline Trail for experienced hikers (bring bear spray and know how to use it), or the easier Trail of the Cedars if you're traveling with kids. For a perspective few visitors see, take a sunset boat tour on Lake McDonald‚Äîthe water turns liquid gold.

After you've hiked until your legs ache and photographed until your memory card screams for mercy, treat yourself to huckleberry ice cream at the Lake McDonald Lodge. It tastes like Montana summer, if Montana summer could be served in a waffle cone.

# 2. Oregon Coast ‚Äî The Pacific's Moody Masterpiece

""You picked the wrong month,"" the barista in Cannon Beach told me as she handed over my coffee. ""June has better weather."" She wasn't wrong about the weather‚Äîthe morning fog was so thick I could barely see Haystack Rock a hundred yards offshore. But she was completely wrong about my choice of timing.

July is when the Oregon Coast shrugs off its reputation for rain and reveals its true personality: dramatic, accessible, and achingly beautiful. The beaches stretch for miles, flanked by haystack rocks rising from the sand like giant sentinels. State parks offer tide pooling, sea caves at low tide, and coastal trails where Douglas firs meet the Pacific.

I spent a week driving Highway 101 from Astoria to Brookings, stopping at every scenic viewpoint (there are approximately one million). Some highlights refuse to leave my memory: scrambling through Hug Point's sea caves as the tide retreated, watching sunset paint Thor's Well at Yachats, eating fish and chips at Local Ocean in Newport while sea lions barked their approval from the docks below.

**What Makes July Special:** It's the driest month on the Oregon Coast, with the least fog and longest sunny stretches. Ocean temperatures reach their annual peak‚Äîstill bracingly cold at 55-60¬∞F, but swimmable if you're brave. Clamming season is open, whale watching continues, and coastal festivals fill the calendar.

**The Reality Check:** ""Dry"" is relative on the Oregon Coast. Pack layers, a rain jacket, and adjust your expectations. The beauty here isn't about perfect beach weather‚Äîit's about rugged, wild coastline that feels distinctly Pacific Northwest.

**Don't Miss:** Spend sunrise at Cannon Beach before day-trippers arrive. Explore the tide pools at Yachats during low tide. Drive the scenic Three Capes Loop. Stop at Tillamook Creamery for ice cream (or take the free factory tour if it's drizzling). Book a table at Stephanie Inn in Cannon Beach for the most romantic dinner of your life.

After experiencing the magic of Oregon's coast, you'll understand why locals guard these beaches like secrets. When you're ready to plan your own coastal escape, [browse accommodation options from beachfront motels to forest retreats](https://expedia.com/affiliate/U51Zc8j) to find your perfect Pacific Northwest base. I recommend staying at least three nights‚Äîtwo in a coastal town like Yachats or Cannon Beach, one inland near the forest for contrast.

# 3. Traverse City, Michigan ‚Äî Cherry Capital Summer

The first cherry I picked and ate straight from the tree tasted like sunshine condensed into fruit form. I stood in a U-pick orchard outside Traverse City, Lake Michigan glinting in the distance, hands already stained red from enthusiastic sampling. ""You know you're supposed to put them in the bucket, right?"" the orchard owner called out, laughing.

Traverse City explodes into celebration every July during the National Cherry Festival, an eight-day extravaganza that somehow manages to feel genuinely local despite drawing 500,000 visitors. But even outside festival week, this northern Michigan gem delivers quintessential summer vacation vibes: pristine beaches on Lake Michigan, award-winning wineries dotting the Old Mission Peninsula, farm stands overflowing with cherries in every form imaginable.

I spent three days here last July and fell hard for the place. Mornings started with coffee at Higher Grounds before biking the TART Trail to nearby beaches. Afternoons meant wine tastings at Peninsula Cellars or Left Foot Charley, where the Rieslings could convert anyone into a white wine drinker. Evenings ended with sunset on West Bay Beach, watching the sky turn cotton-candy pink over the water.

**What Makes July Special:** It's cherry harvest time, meaning everything features cherries‚Äîcherry pie, cherry salsa, cherry wine, cherry salad dressing, cherry BBQ sauce. The National Cherry Festival runs the first full week of July with parades, air shows, and concerts. Lake Michigan warms to actually swimmable temperatures (low 70s).

**The Reality Check:** Book accommodations by April for July visits, especially during festival week. Traffic gets heavy, and parking downtown requires patience. Prices spike during festival week but drop significantly the rest of the month.

**Don't Miss:** Watch the Blue Angels air show during festival week (free from the beach). Take the wine trail seriously‚ÄîOld Mission Peninsula's microclimate produces stunning Rieslings. Grab a Bloody Mary at Amical for the best brunch in town. Rent a boat for a day on the lake, or just claim a patch of sand at West End Beach.

The town's motto might as well be ""arrive for the cherries, stay for everything else."" Between the beaches, the wine, the farm-to-table restaurants, and that distinctly Midwestern friendliness, Traverse City represents peak American summer without the coastal price tags.

# 4. Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park, Maine ‚Äî Where Mountains Meet the Atlantic

I watched the sunrise from Cadillac Mountain, the first place in America to see daylight from October through March. At 5:30 AM in July, I wasn't alone‚Äîa hundred other determined souls had dragged themselves out of warm beds to watch dawn paint the Atlantic in shades of rose and amber. But nobody spoke. We just stood there in the crisp morning air, watching islands emerge from the fog like slowly developing photographs.

Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park form one of those rare combinations where a charming coastal town partners perfectly with a world-class national park. The town delivers fresh lobster rolls, boutique shopping, and New England maritime charm. The park counters with rocky coastline, glacier-carved mountains, and hiking trails that range from easy walks to quad-burning climbs.

I spent five days exploring both and could have easily doubled that. Acadia's beauty operates on a different frequency‚Äîit's not the dramatic scale of Western parks but rather an intimate grandeur where mountains rise straight from the ocean, tide pools teem with life, and the famous ""popovers"" at Jordan Pond House taste even better than advertised.

**What Makes July Special:** It's Acadia's busiest month, but also when everything is fully accessible. Wildflowers bloom along trails. Whales migrate through the bay. Lobster season is in full swing, meaning restaurant lobster rolls feature the freshest catch. Water temperatures approach 60¬∞F‚Äîcold but swimmable for those brave enough.

**The Reality Check:** Acadia requires vehicle reservations for Cadillac Summit Road from late June through mid-October. They release at 10 AM two months in advance and often sell out within days. The park's Island Explorer bus system is free and eliminates parking hassles‚Äîuse it. Downtown Bar Harbor gets crowded‚Äîarrive early or late for the best experience.

**Don't Miss:** Bike the car-free carriage roads (rent from Bar Harbor Bicycle Shop). Hike the Precipice Trail if you're not afraid of heights and iron rungs bolted into cliff faces. Order the lobster roll at Stewman's Lobster Pound‚Äîit's messy, buttery, and utterly perfect. Take the morning boat tour to see puffins on Eastern Egg Rock.

The combination of hiking Acadia's trails, eating lobster with ocean views, and falling asleep to foghorns creates memories that stick. This is New England at its most photogenic, and July catches it in perfect summer form.

# 5. Colorado Rockies (Aspen, Crested Butte, Telluride) ‚Äî Alpine Summer Paradise

The wildflowers started at the trailhead‚Äîjust a few purple lupines mixed into the grass. Half a mile up the trail to Maroon Bells, they'd multiplied into crowds. A mile in, they'd become a riot. By the time I reached the lake, I stood surrounded by an alpine garden so colorful it seemed Photoshopped: purple columbines, yellow alpine sunflowers, white bistort, red Indian paintbrush, blue harebells. All of this against the backdrop of the Maroon Bells, those twin peaks that might be the most photographed mountains in America.

Colorado's high country transforms completely in July. Snow melts from all but the highest peaks, unlocking hundreds of miles of hiking trails. Mountain towns that spend winter covered in powder now fill with hikers, mountain bikers, and visitors who've discovered that summer in the Rockies beats winter hands-down for pure natural beauty.

I split a week between Crested Butte and Aspen, and they couldn't feel more different while being only 30 miles apart. Crested Butte is scruffier, more laid-back, with a main street that still feels like an actual town rather than an outdoor shopping mall. Aspen brings sophistication‚Äîworld-class restaurants, art galleries, music festivals‚Äîbut also eye-watering prices. Telluride, which I visited on a day trip, splits the difference: stunning scenery with a cool, slightly hippie vibe.

**What Makes July Special:** It's peak wildflower season in the high country. Mountain passes are fully open. Rivers run cold and fast, perfect for rafting. Music festivals fill the calendar‚ÄîAspen Music Festival, Telluride Bluegrass Festival. Days are warm (70s-80s), nights are cool, and afternoon thunderstorms clear out by evening.

**The Reality Check:** Altitude affects everyone differently. Drink water obsessively. Many towns sit above 8,000 feet, and trailheads often start at 10,000+. Afternoon thunderstorms are reliable‚Äîstart hikes early, be off exposed ridges by 1 PM.

**Don't Miss:** Hike to the Maroon Bells at sunrise (requires reservations but worth the hassle). Mountain bike Crested Butte's extensive trail system. Take the free gondola up Aspen Mountain just for the views. Soak in the natural hot springs at Conundrum or Penny Hot Springs. Eat lunch at the Pine Creek Cookhouse, accessible by mountain bike or foot.

When you're planning your Rocky Mountain adventure, consider that location makes all the difference. Staying in the heart of these mountain towns means you can walk to restaurants after a full day of hiking, catch free concerts in town squares, and avoid driving narrow mountain roads after dark. For your Colorado base, [compare lodging options from historic hotels to mountain lodges](https://expedia.com/affiliate/U51Zc8j) to match your budget and style. Book early‚ÄîJuly is peak season, and the best places fill up by March.

# 6. Olympic National Park, Washington ‚Äî Three Parks in One

Rain doesn't seem like the right word for what was happening in Olympic's Hoh Rainforest. Mist, maybe. Or atmosphere made visible. I walked the Hall of Mosses Trail, where every tree trunk wore a coat of moss so thick it looked like upholstery, and felt like I'd stepped into Middle Earth. The air tasted green. Nurse logs the size of school buses lay decomposing, hosting entire gardens on their backs.

Olympic is three distinct ecosystems crammed into one national park: temperate rainforest, rugged Pacific coastline, and alpine mountains. Most visitors only scratch the surface, but July offers a rare window to experience all three.

I spent six days exploring Olympic and never felt like I was in the same park twice. Hurricane Ridge offered mountain views and marmots whistling from the rocks. The Hoh Rainforest felt prehistoric, alien, magical. Ruby Beach at sunset, with its sea stacks and tide pools, delivered that iconic Pacific Northwest coastal experience. Marymere Falls provided a quick, family-friendly hike to a stunning waterfall.

**What Makes July Special:** July is Olympic's driest month (though ""dry"" is relative in a rainforest). All areas are fully accessible‚Äîmountain roads open, trails are snow-free, beach access is excellent. Wildlife viewing peaks: Roosevelt elk in the valleys, black bears in the forests, sea otters off the coast.

**The Reality Check:** Olympic is massive‚Äînearly 1 million acres. Driving between areas takes hours. You can't realistically ""do"" the whole park in a weekend. Pick two or three areas and go deep rather than trying to see everything. Cell service is essentially nonexistent in most of the park.

**Don't Miss:** Lake Crescent's insanely blue water (there's a lodge with a dining room overlooking it). The tide pools at Ruby Beach during low tide. Hurricane Ridge at sunrise before the crowds arrive. Sol Duc Hot Springs after a long day of hiking. The Hoh Rainforest on a foggy morning when it feels most otherworldly.

Stay in Port Angeles for central access, or split your time between coastal and mountain accommodations. Lake Quinault Lodge offers rustic charm and excellent positioning for exploring the rainforest areas. Pack layers‚Äîyou'll experience four seasons in a single day here.

# 7. Alaska's Inside Passage (Juneau, Glacier Bay, Kenai Fjords) ‚Äî The Last Frontier's Summer

The humpback whale breached so close to our boat that everyone stopped mid-sentence. It hung in the air for what felt like minutes but was probably three seconds‚Äî40 tons of animal defying gravity‚Äîbefore crashing back into Auke Bay with a sound like thunder. Water exploded outward. Someone's camera fell to the deck. The naturalist on board just grinned and said, ""Welcome to Alaska.""

Alaska in July is a completely different animal than Alaska the rest of the year. Literally‚Äîthe wildlife emerges, the weather cooperates (mostly), and that famous midnight sun means 18-20 hours of daylight for exploring. It's expensive, yes, but you're experiencing America's wildest landscapes during the one month when they're most accessible.

I split ten days between Juneau and Seward, using each as a base for day trips and excursions. Juneau offered the Mendenhall Glacier (actively calving into its lake), helicopter tours over the Juneau Icefield, and whale watching in Auke Bay. Seward delivered Kenai Fjords National Park, where glaciers tumble into the ocean and orcas patrol the waters looking for seals.

**What Makes July Special:** Peak wildlife viewing‚Äîwhales, bears catching salmon, puffins, bald eagles, seals, sea otters, and orcas all active. Weather is at its most cooperative with daytime temps in the 60s and relatively little rain. Wildflowers bloom across the tundra. Glaciers are actively calving, creating dramatic icebergs.

**The Reality Check:** Alaska isn't cheap. Day tours run $150-400 per person. Hotels book early and command premium rates. But this is bucket-list territory‚Äîthe experience justifies the cost. Pack for all weather conditions. Even in July, bring warm layers and rain gear.

**Don't Miss:** The Kenai Fjords boat tour out of Seward (spring for the longer Northwestern Fjord route). Mendenhall Glacier's visitor center and trails. Helicopter glacier landing if your budget allows (yes, it's expensive; yes, it's worth it). Fresh halibut fish and chips at Tracy's King Crab Shack in Juneau. Brown bears fishing for salmon at Anan Creek near Wrangell.

Watching a glacier calve‚Äîhearing the crack, watching the ice fall, feeling the waves rock your boat minutes later‚Äîreminds you how small you are and how big the world remains. Alaska in July offers that humbling experience wrapped in summer's most accessible weather.

# 8. Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, Wyoming ‚Äî The Crown Jewels

Old Faithful erupted exactly when the ranger predicted it would, sending 8,400 gallons of boiling water 130 feet into the air. I stood among the crowd on the wooden boardwalk, close enough to feel the mist, far enough to avoid getting scalded, and marveled at nature's punctuality. This geyser has been performing this trick every 60-110 minutes for as long as humans have been watching.

Yellowstone in July is simultaneously the worst time to visit (crowds, traffic, full parking lots) and the best (everything open, warm weather, active wildlife). It's America's first national park, its most famous, and its most challenging to navigate in peak season. Grand Teton, located just ten miles south, offers slightly fewer crowds and arguably more dramatic mountain scenery.

I spent eight days exploring both parks, and here's the secret: arrive early, stay late, and embrace the crowds during midday by visiting less-popular areas. While everyone queues for Old Faithful at noon, you can have the Upper Geyser Basin's backcountry geysers nearly to yourself. When the Grand Prismatic Spring parking lot is a nightmare at 2 PM, the Lamar Valley has room to spare.

**What Makes July Special:** All areas are accessible with no snow closures. Wildlife viewing is excellent‚Äîgrizzlies and black bears, wolves in Lamar Valley, bison everywhere, elk calves. Wildflowers bloom at higher elevations. Rivers are flowing for rafting. Clear weather means excellent photography conditions.

**The Reality Check:** July is Yellowstone's busiest month. South entrance wait times can hit two hours. Parking lots fill by 9 AM at popular spots. Lodging inside the parks books up a year in advance. But there's a reason millions visit‚Äîthis landscape is unlike anywhere else on Earth.

**Don't Miss:** Sunrise at Grand Prismatic Spring before the crowds (park at Fairy Falls trailhead and walk the boardwalk). Wildlife watching in Lamar Valley at dawn and dusk. Jenny Lake in the Tetons‚Äîtake the boat shuttle across and hike to Hidden Falls. Rafting the Snake River for Teton views. Grabbing lunch at Jackson Lake Lodge's Blue Heron Lounge with those million-dollar mountain views.

The geothermal features alone‚Äîgeysers, hot springs, mud pots, fumaroles‚Äîjustify the crowds. Add in the wildlife and scenery, and you understand why Yellowstone remains America's most-visited national park despite the logistical challenges.

# 9. San Juan Islands, Washington ‚Äî Pacific Northwest Secret

The orca surfaced twenty feet from the kayak, its dorsal fin cutting the water like a knife. My guide had promised we might see whales, but I'd assumed that meant distant spouts on the horizon. This was close enough to hear the whale exhale‚Äîthat distinctive blow sound. Close enough to make direct eye contact. Close enough to feel very small in a very big ocean.

The San Juan Islands float in the Salish Sea between Washington and British Columbia, accessible via ferry from Anacortes. They're the Pacific Northwest at its most idyllic: forested islands with rocky coastlines, small towns that empty out after summer tourists leave, and some of the best whale watching in North America. July is when resident orcas patrol these waters, hunting salmon.

I spent five days on San Juan Island, the archipelago's largest, and barely scratched the surface. Kayaking from Friday Harbor let me explore the coastline at orca speed (slow). Biking the island's quiet roads revealed farms, lavender fields, and coastal vistas. The charming main street of Friday Harbor offered art galleries, seafood restaurants, and the kind of pace that makes you forget your phone exists.

**What Makes July Special:** Peak season for resident orcas‚Äîthree pods (J, K, and L) spend summers in these waters. Weather is at its most cooperative with warm, sunny days. Lavender farms are in full bloom. Kayaking conditions are ideal. Days are long for maximum exploration time.

**The Reality Check:** Ferry reservations are essential in summer and book weeks in advance. Accommodation options are limited and fill early. Restaurants can have waits‚Äîmake reservations. The islands move at their own pace‚Äîthis isn't the place for a packed itinerary.

**Don't Miss:** A whale watching boat tour (multiple companies operate from Friday Harbor). Kayaking along the coast (San Juan Outfitters is excellent). Biking to American Camp for coastal trails and historical sites. Pelindaba Lavender Farm when the fields are blooming. Sunset from Lime Kiln Point State Park, one of the world's best shore-based whale watching spots.

After experiencing the San Juans' unhurried magic, you'll understand why Seattleites speak of it in hushed, protective tones. Between the whales, the kayaking, the fresh seafood, and the island vibe, this represents the Pacific Northwest's most compelling summer escape.

# 10. Finger Lakes, New York ‚Äî Wine Country Without the Attitude

The Riesling tasted like bottled summer‚Äîcrisp, slightly sweet, with notes of peach and honey. I sat on the patio at Hermann J. Wiemer Winery, looking out over Seneca Lake's blue expanse, and understood why Wine Enthusiast had named this region the top Wine Region of the Year. This wasn't Napa's polished luxury or Sonoma's casual elegance. This was wine country that still felt like farmland, where tractors share the road with BMWs.

The Finger Lakes‚Äîeleven glacial lakes etched into central New York‚Äîhave quietly become one of America's top wine regions, specializing in cool-climate wines that rival Germany's best. But July here isn't just about wine. It's about swimming in impossibly clear lakes, hiking gorge trails past waterfalls, attending music festivals, and eating farm-to-table meals prepared by chefs who source ingredients from farms you drove past that morning.

I spent a week based in Ithaca, day-tripping to wineries around Seneca and Cayuga Lakes. Mornings started with hikes at Watkins Glen State Park or Taughannock Falls. Afternoons meant wine tastings‚ÄîFox Run Vineyards for stunning views, Boundary Breaks for incredible Rieslings, Dr. Konstantin Frank for history. Evenings ended with farm dinners at restaurants like Dano's or the Stonecat Caf√©.

**What Makes July Special:** It's peak summer without the crowds you'd find in Napa. Lake temperatures hit 70s‚Äîperfect for swimming. Gorge trails are lush and green with summer foliage. Wine trails are active but not overwhelming. The Finger Lakes GrassRoots Festival happens mid-July for those seeking live music.

**The Reality Check:** The region is spread out‚Äîplan for lots of driving. Not every winery is worth visiting (there are 100+). Focus on the eastern shore of Seneca Lake and western shore of Cayuga Lake for the highest concentration of quality producers. Designate a driver or book a wine tour.

**Don't Miss:** Watkins Glen State Park's gorge trail with its 19 waterfalls. The wine trail along Seneca Lake's east side. Swimming at Taughannock Falls State Park. Breakfast at Ithaca Bakery. Sunset cruise on Seneca Lake while sipping local wine. The Saturday farmers market in Ithaca for that small-town America vibe.

This region delivers sophisticated wine culture without pretension, stunning natural beauty without crowds, and that rare combination of things to do and permission to do nothing but relax lakeside with a cold glass of Riesling.

# 11. Boundary Waters, Minnesota ‚Äî Paddling into Silence

The loon's call echoed across the lake, that iconic tremolo that sounds like laughter or crying depending on your mood. I sat in my canoe at dusk, paddle resting across my lap, watching the sun turn the water molten gold. Behind me, smoke rose from our campfire on a small island in the middle of nowhere. We hadn't seen another person in two days.

The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness‚Äî1.1 million acres of interconnected lakes and rivers along the Minnesota-Canada border‚Äîoffers something increasingly rare: the chance to disappear into wilderness accessible to anyone who can paddle a canoe. No motors allowed. No roads. No cell service. Just you, your canoe, and more lakes than you could paddle in a lifetime.

I spent four days on a loop through the lakes near Ely, portaging between them (carrying the canoe overland), camping on rock islands, and embracing the simplicity of life reduced to paddling, cooking, and watching stars that multiplied the farther we got from civilization. It was humbling, exhausting, and completely addictive.

**What Makes July Special:** Weather is warm and stable. Mosquito season has passed (mostly‚Äîbring bug spray anyway). Lakes are at good levels for paddling. Days are long, giving you maximum time to cover distance. Campsites are in demand but available with planning.

**The Reality Check:** This requires real preparation. You need permits (reserve months in advance), proper equipment, backcountry skills, and comfort with self-sufficiency. This isn't glamping‚Äîyou're carrying everything you need in a canoe and pooping in the woods. But the reward is unmatched solitude in genuine wilderness.

**Don't Miss:** Sunrise from your campsite (you'll be awake anyway‚Äîwilderness mornings start early). Swimming in pristine lakes that feel like liquid silk. Northern lights if you're lucky (they're visible even in summer this far north). The satisfaction of successfully portaging your gear. Stars so thick they cast shadows.

Outfitters in Ely like Piragis or Wilderness Outfitters can set you up with everything you need, including route planning help. For first-timers, consider hiring a guide for the first trip‚Äîthey'll teach you skills you can use forever.

The Boundary Waters teaches you that luxury isn't about thread count or amenities. It's about silence so complete you can hear your own heartbeat, water clean enough to drink straight from the lake, and the soul-deep satisfaction of going places few people reach.

# Planning Your Perfect July Adventure

After years of July travel across America, I've developed a system that consistently delivers great experiences while avoiding the worst crowds and heat. Here's what actually works:

**Book Early, Seriously:** For July travel, ""early"" means February or March. National park lodges often open reservations 13 months in advance. Popular Airbnbs in places like Bar Harbor or Traverse City book up by April. Don't be the person scrambling for accommodations in June‚Äîyou'll pay double and have limited options.

**Embrace the Shoulder Hours:** The window between 6-9 AM and after 5 PM is magic. Popular spots that are mobbed at midday often feel peaceful early or late. I've had Old Faithful almost to myself at 6:30 AM, and Acadia's Ocean Path to myself after 6 PM. When planning your stay, [search for accommodations near park entrances or in gateway towns](https://expedia.com/affiliate/U51Zc8j) so you can easily arrive early and maximize your time during those golden shoulder hours.

**Pack for Temperature Swings:** July in America can mean 95¬∞F in the afternoon and 45¬∞F at night, especially in mountains and high deserts. Bring layers you can peel off or add. A puffy jacket isn't overkill even in summer.

**Reserve Strategically:** Many parks now require advance reservations for vehicle entry or specific attractions. Yellowstone requires nothing (yet), but Glacier needs permits for Going-to-the-Sun Road. Acadia needs them for Cadillac Summit Road. Check park websites in April and set phone reminders for when reservations open.

**Consider Splitting Your Time:** The destinations on this list pair beautifully. Yellowstone and Grand Teton are 10 miles apart. Olympic and the San Juans are both in Washington. Colorado's mountain towns connect via scenic highways. Alaska's Inside Passage destinations link via ferry. Plan for two bases rather than one-night stays everywhere.

**Budget Realistically:** July is peak season everywhere, meaning peak prices. Expect to pay $200-400 per night for decent accommodations in popular areas. National park entry fees run $30-35 per vehicle. Factor in activities‚Äîboat tours, guided experiences, and equipment rentals add up fast. But the memories? Priceless.

**Prepare for Weather Extremes:** July brings afternoon thunderstorms in the Rockies, occasional rain in the Pacific Northwest, heat waves in the interior. Check forecasts daily, but pack for all conditions. I've used both my rain jacket and sunscreen in the same afternoon countless times.

# The Bottom Line

July gets criticized by travel snobs who prefer shoulder seasons and empty trails. Let them have their May and September. Because July is when America shows off‚Äîwhen every trail opens, every flower blooms, every town celebrates, and every reason you bought those vacation days crystallizes into experiences you'll tell stories about for decades.

Yes, you'll share these places with crowds. Yes, you'll pay premium prices. Yes, you'll need to plan ahead and wake up early and maybe deal with some traffic. The trade-off? You get to see grizzlies in Glacier, paddle among orcas in the San Juans, stand beneath Yellowstone's geysers, eat lobster rolls in Bar Harbor, and understand why people travel thousands of miles to experience American summer at its peak.

The secret isn't avoiding July. It's choosing your destinations wisely, timing your activities strategically, and embracing the adventure with eyes wide open.

So which July destination speaks to you? Are you drawn to Alaska's wild grandeur or the Finger Lakes' gentle beauty? Do Colorado's mountains call louder than Oregon's coast? There's no wrong answer‚Äîonly different flavors of extraordinary.

The summer sun is already climbing. The trails are waiting. Your perfect American July is out there.

Go find it.

1o3te6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1o3te6l/investigate_whether_the_bona_floor_cleaner/,Investigate Whether the Bona Floor Cleaner Cartridge Is Worth It,"The Bona WM700054001 is an essential cleaning product for anyone who values streak-free and residue-free hardwood floors. Over the past month, I‚Äôve used this refillable cartridge in my Bona Spray Mop for cleaning the wooden flooring in our home, especially in high-traffic areas like the kitchen and living room. Whether it was the mess from my kids spilling juice or the dirt tracked in by our energetic dog, this floor cleaner handled it all with impressive effectiveness. The unscented solution works its magic without suffocating the room with overpowering smells, and that is a major win in my book!  

**Ease of Handling and Refill Process**  
The design of the refill cartridge is simple yet user-friendly. Its flat bottom and wide opening made refilling incredibly straightforward, with no unnecessary spills. I especially appreciated the audible click when locking it into the spray mop, confirming it is securely in place‚Äîit's very reassuring, especially given how clumsy I can be before my morning coffee. This cartridge contains 34 fluid ounces of cleaning solution, which lasted longer than I initially thought it would, even with frequent use. 

**Positives**  
- User-friendly, refillable design with an audible click for secure setup.  
- Unscented formula is allergen-friendly.  
- Leaves no sticky residue, truly a fast-drying solution.  
- Made with 95% plant-derived, USDA-certified biobased content for environmental sustainability.  

[Check Bona WM700054001 price on Amazon.](https://info.senaar.com/p/b07119xfq1/)  

**Cleaning Performance and Residue-Free Finish**  
This hardwood floor cleaner gets my full endorsement for its ability to clean floors effectively without leaving behind streaks or any sort of filmy residue. It even brought out a bit of the natural luster of our oak flooring, which my spouse absolutely loved. Because it‚Äôs water-based and Safer Choice certified, I can feel good about using it around my family and pets without worrying about harmful chemicals. Its cleaner, greener approach to floor care feels like a welcome change from harsher chemical solutions I've used in the past.  

**Compatibility and Limitations**  
One important note: this cartridge is not compatible with the Spray Mop Air model, so be sure you have the right mop before purchasing. I luckily checked the product description, and I‚Äôd recommend you do the same to avoid any frustrations. It could be a significant downside for someone looking for compatibility across all Bona mops.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Limited compatibility with specific spray mop models.  
- Some users might prefer a scented option for a fresher aroma after cleaning.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to other floor cleaners like the Swiffer Wet Jet solution or the Method Squirt + Mop, this product stands out for its plant-derived formula, which feels genuinely better not just for my home‚Äôs floors but also for the environment. The Method cleaner smells fantastic but often leaves a bit of a soapy texture, whereas this solution leaves the surface immaculately clean. While Swiffer products are widely used, the disposable nature of their pads and solution packaging feels less eco-friendly compared to this refillable, recyclable option. Bona truly excels in creating a balance between performance and sustainability.  

**Quality for Price**  
Considering its volume, versatility for hardwood floors, and eco-friendly design, this cleaning product delivers excellent value. It may be slightly pricier than standard hardwood floor cleaners, but its longevity and safe composition give it an edge. For those invested in green cleaning, the cost feels justified when balanced against its strong cleaning performance and plant-based ingredients.

1o3tdke,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1o3tdke/is_the_aquaboon_sediment_water_filter_the_best/,Is the Aquaboon Sediment Water Filter the Best Choice for Your Home Review?,"The Aquaboon 14188880 5 Micron Pleated Sediment Water Filter is an industrial-style cartridge designed for whole-house water filtration systems. Over the past several weeks, I‚Äôve been putting this filter to the test in my own home. With well water being my primary source, ensuring contaminants like sediment, rust, and sand are effectively removed is critical for maintaining my water quality and protecting appliances. This review dives into the strengths and weaknesses of this product based on my personal experience.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The filter‚Äôs construction, made of durable polyester microfibers, immediately stood out when I held it for the first time. It feels substantial but isn‚Äôt overly heavy considering it weighs three pounds. The pleated design optimizes surface area, which is great because it allows for a better flow rate while maintaining efficient filtration. It slid easily into my existing 10 x 4.5-inch housing, so there was no need for extra tools or a professional installation. From an aesthetics standpoint, it‚Äôs not the prettiest filter you‚Äôll ever see, but functionality here definitely takes precedence over appearance.

**Ease of Installation**  
Installing this sediment filter was a breeze. As someone who‚Äôs reasonably handy, I appreciated the straightforward design. Everything fit snugly into my Culligan housing without any adjustments or complications. If you‚Äôre not particularly DIY-savvy, don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthis doesn‚Äôt require any expertise. Just remove the old filter cartridge, pop the new one in, and you‚Äôre good to go. No leaks, no mess, no drama. 

[Find the best price for Aquaboon 14188880 on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b01m0mllhx/)  

**Performance and Water Quality**  
After switching to this pleated sediment filter, the improvement in water clarity was instantly noticeable. The 5-micron filtration capability does an impressive job of trapping impurities, making a real difference in the taste and appearance of my water. Coffee, tea‚Äîeverything just seems fresher and cleaner. Bonus points for protecting my appliances like my dishwasher and washing machine from sediment buildup. The water pressure remained consistently strong, even after a couple of months of use. It‚Äôs also worth noting that the filter is perfect for families like mine that deal with higher sediment loads in well water.

**Compatibility with Systems**  
The universal compatibility of this filter is a fantastic feature. I‚Äôve personally tested it with my GE GXWH30C system, but other households in my area use it with models like the GXWH35F or Culligan HD-950 successfully. In conversations with a co-worker, they mentioned it works great with Dupont HDC3001 and even older systems like the Watts FM-BB-10-5. Hearing this made me feel better about my investment. Its flexibility also makes replacements easy to source online or at local hardware stores.

**Upsides**  
- Excellent sediment filtration, even for heavy sediment loads.  
- High compatibility with various water filtration system models.  
- Straightforward installation process with no additional tools needed.  

**Negatives**  
- Packaging wasn‚Äôt great; one of the pleats looked slightly bent upon arrival.  
- Only available in a pack of four, which might be unnecessary for those who don‚Äôt use filters often.  

**Challengers**  
This filter has some tough competition, primarily from products like the Culligan CP5-BBS and American Plumber W30PEHD. While these alternatives share similar 5-micron ratings and compatibility range, I found the Aquaboon filter to strike a better balance between price and durability. The Culligan options tend to be pricier without offering enhanced features. On the flip side, budget brands like Hydronix SPC-45-1005 sometimes fail to deliver comparable longevity. Though slightly more expensive upfront, this product provides peace of mind for longer-term use.

**Price Performance**  
At its current price point, this product enters the sweet spot where affordability meets reliability. It doesn‚Äôt feel exorbitantly overpriced like some premium brands but manages to outperform cheaper alternatives significantly when considering lifespan and maintenance costs. For me, buying a four-pack initially seemed excessive, but given how often I change filters, it‚Äôs actually saving money in the long run. If you‚Äôve got a whole-house water system and need effective sediment filtering without constant replacements, this filter is worth every penny.

1o3tbaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1o3tbaa/best_places_to_visit_in_usa_in_june/,Best Places To Visit In Usa In June,"The afternoon I watched 500 hot air balloons lift off in Albuquerque, I realized something: June doesn't *start* summer in America‚Äîit explodes it into being.

While the rest of the world treats June like a warm-up act, Americans know better. This is when Yellowstone's geysers finally become accessible after winter's retreat. When cherry trees in Traverse City bow under the weight of their crimson harvest. When Nashville's neon lights reflect off guitars held by the world's best country artists, all gathered for one electric weekend.

June 2025 brings something the guidebooks won't tell you: it's the secret sweet spot between Memorial Day crowds and July's peak-season prices. National parks are fully open but not yet overwhelmed. Festival lineups are stacked. The weather? Seventy-five degrees of pure possibility, with long daylight hours that make you forget time exists.

I've spent fifteen Junes crisscrossing this country‚Äîfrom watching fireflies synchronize their glow in the Smokies to floating the Boulder Creek with locals who've perfected the art of summer. What I've learned is that June isn't just a month; it's an invitation. Here are the seven places that accept it most beautifully.

# Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming: Mountains That Make You Believe in Magic

The Teton Range doesn't gradually reveal itself‚Äîit punches through the Wyoming horizon like a declaration. When I first saw those jagged peaks reflected in Jenny Lake, still rimmed with snow in early June, I understood why the French trappers called them ""les trois t√©tons"" (the three breasts). They were thinking of home, of something nurturing and impossibly beautiful.

June is when Grand Teton transforms from winter fortress to summer sanctuary. Most of the snow has melted by mid-month, creating waterfalls that weren't there in May and won't last through July. Hidden Falls lives up to its name, cascading behind a veil of mist you can only reach by boat and trail. The boat ride across Jenny Lake costs $20 round-trip, but watching the Tetons grow larger with each paddle stroke? That's the kind of math where money loses meaning.

Start your day at Schwabacher Landing at dawn. The beaver ponds mirror the mountains so perfectly you'll question which is real. I watched a moose wade through water that looked like liquid silver, antlers breaking the sky's reflection into fractured light. By 6 AM, photographer after photographer set up tripods‚Äîthis is the most photographed sunrise spot in Wyoming, and in June's golden light, you understand why.

The trails open progressively through the month. Taggart Lake offers a moderate 3.5-mile loop through meadows where wildflowers paint the ground in yellows and purples that seem almost aggressive in their beauty. Inspiration Point rewards your uphill effort with views that make every step feel like preparation for this single moment of clarity.

Where you stay matters here. Jackson Hole serves as the gateway town, full of western charm and surprisingly excellent restaurants. The town square, framed by antler arches, buzzes with energy from morning coffee to evening whiskey. June means room rates haven't hit their July peak yet‚Äîyou're looking at $150-250 per night for quality lodging versus $300+ come peak summer.

# Acadia National Park, Maine: Where America's Day Begins

Cadillac Mountain holds a secret most Americans don't know: from October through March, it receives the first sunrise in the United States. In June, you won't be first, but you'll witness something arguably better‚Äîthe sun rising over a coast where the mountains literally meet the sea, an impossibility of geography that works because nature doesn't care about the rules we write.

I set my alarm for 4 AM, drove the winding road in darkness, and joined fifty other pilgrims at the summit. We stood there, strangers bound by this shared vigil, watching the sky shift from navy to lavender to gold. Someone played harmonica. Nobody told them to stop. At 4:54 AM, the sun cracked the horizon, and the Atlantic Ocean became liquid fire. I understood then why this place carries ""acadia"" in its name‚Äîit means paradise.

Bar Harbor serves as Acadia's charming anchor, a town where lobster rolls cost $25 but contain an entire lobster's worth of meat, butter-glossed and tucked into a toasted bun that somehow stays crispy despite the moisture. The Shore Path winds along the water, connecting grand estates built by industrialists who came here in the 1890s seeking refuge from summer heat. They chose well. June temperatures hover in the comfortable mid-60s to low-70s, perfect for hiking without overheating.

The park's carriage roads offer 45 miles of car-free paths originally built by John D. Rockefeller Jr., who believed in beauty accessible to all. Rent a bike in Bar Harbor ($30-40 per day) and pedal beneath stone bridges that look transported from a European fairy tale. Jordan Pond offers the gentlest loop‚Äî3.3 miles of mostly flat terrain that circles impossibly clear water. Stop at Jordan Pond House for popovers and tea, a tradition that dates back over a century. Yes, it's touristy. Yes, it's also delicious.

The Precipice Trail demands respect and rewards courage. Iron rungs ladder up 1,000-foot cliffs‚Äîit's not technically rock climbing, but your hands will get involved. The trail sometimes closes in June to protect nesting peregrine falcons. If it's open when you visit, consider it a gift. The views from the top stretch across Frenchman Bay to islands that look like scattered emeralds on blue velvet.

# Nashville, Tennessee: Where Country Music Writes Its Annual Love Letter

CMA Fest transforms Nashville from Music City into Music *Universe* from June 5-8, 2025. Picture this: 70,000 country music fans converging on a city that already breathes in 4/4 time. Nissan Stadium hosts nightly concerts where artists you've streamed for years perform like their careers depend on this one show. Broadway becomes an endless stage where every honky-tonk overflows with music, where you can catch tomorrow's superstars playing 2 PM sets for tips and beer.

But here's what makes CMA Fest different from other music festivals: accessibility. Four-day passes start around $300, and that gets you into venues across the city. Many daytime performances are completely free. I watched a Grammy winner perform a surprise acoustic set at 11 AM in Riverfront Park, charging nothing, playing for the pure love of it. That's Nashville's gift‚Äîmusic isn't something reserved for the wealthy or well-connected. It's the air everyone breathes.

The city itself pulses with creative energy beyond the festival. The Parthenon in Centennial Park‚Äîa full-scale replica of the Athens original‚Äîfeels wildly out of place until you learn Nashville's nickname: ""Athens of the South."" Inside, a 42-foot statue of Athena stands covered in gold leaf, possibly the kitschiest thing in a city that turned kitsch into an art form.

Fifth Avenue's ""gulch"" neighborhood offers the Nashville locals know: industrial-chic restaurants where chefs combine Southern tradition with boundary-pushing creativity. Hattie B's Hot Chicken will test your spice tolerance‚Äîthe ""Shut the Cluck Up"" level sent me into a coughing fit that lasted through two sweet teas. Worth it? Absolutely. Pride month celebrations fill June with even more color and music than usual, with events throughout the month.

Planning a Nashville adventure during CMA Fest requires strategy. Hotels downtown fill up months in advance, and prices reflect the demand‚Äî$300+ per night isn't unusual. But here's the insider move: [check current hotel rates and compare package deals](https://expedia.com/affiliate/U51Zc8j) across greater Nashville. Areas like East Nashville or The Gulch offer excellent access to festival venues while sometimes providing better value than downtown's most famous names. Book by April if you want decent rates.

# Traverse City, Michigan: Cherry Capital of the World

The National Cherry Festival (June 28-July 5, 2025) celebrates Michigan's tart cherry harvest with the enthusiasm Americans usually reserve for championship sports. Traverse City goes full cherry: cherry pie eating contests, cherry pancake breakfasts, cherry beer at local breweries, cherry everything until the word loses meaning and becomes just a sound: *cherry cherry cherry*.

But beneath the festival's cheerful excess lies something more profound‚ÄîGreat Lakes culture at its finest. Grand Traverse Bay stretches in two directions, forming East and West arms that bracket the city in shades of blue that shift from aquamarine to navy depending on depth and sky. The water reaches 65-70 degrees by late June, cold enough to take your breath but warm enough that you adjust after the initial shock.

Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore sits thirty minutes north, where mountains of sand rise 450 feet above Lake Michigan. The Dune Climb draws families who race up the steep face, then tumble down in controlled slides that end in laughter and sand in uncomfortable places. But take the longer trail to Lake Michigan, and you'll find something quieter: dunes that look like the Sahara, forest that feels like Michigan, and a Great Lake that behaves like an ocean, complete with waves and horizons that blur into infinity.

The Old Mission Peninsula bisects Grand Traverse Bay, creating a microclimate perfect for wine grapes. The same latitude as Bordeaux and Burgundy, winemakers discovered, produces surprisingly excellent Rieslings and Pinot Noirs. Chateau Chantal offers sunset tastings where you sip cherry-infused wine (because of course) while watching the sun paint the bay in oranges and purples that would seem excessive in a photograph but feel exactly right in person.

Downtown Traverse City maintains small-town charm while supporting the kind of restaurants you'd expect in cities ten times its size. Trattoria Stella occupies a former Victorian asylum‚Äîthe wine list alone spans fifteen pages. For something more casual, Spanglish serves Mexican-American fusion that works because they refuse to take themselves too seriously. The fish tacos use local whitefish. It shouldn't work. It absolutely does.

# Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado: High-Altitude Heart Expansion

Trail Ridge Road fully opens in late May, weather permitting, revealing one of America's most spectacular drives. This 48-mile route crosses the Continental Divide at 12,183 feet, making it the highest continuous paved road in the United States. The air at that elevation contains about 40% less oxygen than at sea level‚Äîyour body notices. Your heart pounds harder. Your breath comes quicker. But then you step out at the Alpine Visitor Center and see mountain peaks stretching in every direction, and suddenly the altitude sickness feels like a small price for this perspective.

June brings wildflowers to the alpine tundra, tiny explosions of color that last only weeks. Alpine forget-me-nots, blue as heartbreak, cluster in rocks. Alpine sunflowers, yellow as optimism, turn their faces toward the brief summer sun. These flowers exist in a hostile environment‚Äîfreezing nights, intense UV radiation, winds that can knock you sideways‚Äîand they bloom anyway, because that's what living things do.

Bear Lake serves as the park's most popular trailhead, offering everything from a half-mile accessible loop to multi-day backcountry adventures. The 5.6-mile Sky Pond trail rewards your uphill effort with a glacial lake surrounded by cathedral-like cliffs. Timberline Falls cascades into the basin, and even in June, snow patches cling to shaded slopes. The water temperature hovers around 40 degrees‚ÄîI watched a brave soul jump in and come out gasping, instantly regretting everything, absolutely alive.

Elk wander through Moraine Park and Horseshoe Park like they own the place, because technically, they do. June brings calving season, which means cows with calves, which means stay at least 75 feet back because maternal elk don't mess around. I watched a cow nurse her spotted calf at dawn, backlit by pink alpenglow on Longs Peak, and felt like I'd stumbled into a documentary about wilderness that forgot to kick me out.

Estes Park serves as the park's gateway town, full of taffy shops and T-shirt vendors but also some genuine mountain culture. The Stanley Hotel‚Äîthe inspiration for Stephen King's ""The Shining""‚Äîoffers tours where guides tell stories about ghosts in Room 217 and the children who play in the hallways. Book a room if you're brave (or skeptical), but honestly, the views of the park from the hotel's lawn justify the visit whether you believe in spirits or not.

# San Juan Islands, Washington: Where the Pacific Northwest Reveals Its Secret Softness

The San Juan Islands archipelago scatters 172 islands across the waters between Washington State and British Columbia. Only four have ferry service‚ÄîSan Juan, Orcas, Lopez, and Shaw‚Äîbut that limitation feels like a gift. Fewer people. More quiet. Space to breathe air that smells like salt and cedar and something indefinably wild.

June marks the peak of orca whale watching season. These aren't the captive whales performing tricks for tourists‚Äîthese are J, K, and L pods, three families of Southern Resident orcas that hunt salmon in these waters with coordination that speaks to intelligence we barely understand. I took a whale watching boat from Friday Harbor and spent three hours following a pod as they surfaced, dove, and breached. Seeing a creature that weighs 6,000 pounds launch itself completely out of the water‚Äîwater streaming off black and white skin, pure power made visible‚Äîrecalibrates your understanding of grace.

Orcas Island (no relation to the whales, confusingly) rises in elevation more dramatically than its flatter neighbors. Mount Constitution's 2,400-foot summit offers 360-degree views: the Cascade Range to the east, Vancouver Island to the north, and so many islands you'll need a map to name them all. The drive up follows a road that switchbacks through old-growth forest where Douglas firs thick as houses filter sunlight into shafts that look deliberately dramatic.

Roche Harbor on San Juan Island preserves a quirky slice of history. Hotel de Haro, built in 1886, maintains its Victorian-era charm with creaky floors and doors that don't quite close straight. The harbor fills with sailboats and yachts whose owners dress like they stepped out of a Ralph Lauren catalog. At sunset, they lower the American, Canadian, and British flags in an elaborate ceremony complete with bagpipes‚Äîa tradition honoring the Pig War of 1859, when disputed borders nearly led to conflict over, yes, a pig. Spoiler: the pig died. No humans did. Peak absurdist history.

Lavender farms bloom in June, particularly on San Juan Island, where Purple Haze Lavender and Pelindaba Lavender offer fields that look imported from Provence. The scent hits you before you see the purple rows‚Äîsweet, herbal, medicinal, calming. You can pick your own stems ($1 each) or just wander and photograph and breathe air that feels like aromatherapy made physical.

Getting here requires planning. The Washington State Ferry from Anacortes runs regularly but fills up quickly in summer. I arrived two hours early on a Saturday and still waited through two full boat cycles. The crossing takes 90 minutes, passing islands and lighthouses while bald eagles fish overhead. Some visitors bring their cars; others arrive as walk-ons and rent bikes or scooters on the islands. Either works, but bikes give you that perfect island pace‚Äîfast enough to cover ground, slow enough to notice everything.

# Santa Fe, New Mexico: High Desert, Higher Art

Santa Fe sits at 7,000 feet, making it America's highest state capital and giving summer a different quality than you'd expect in New Mexico. June afternoons hit the low 80s but drop to the 50s at night, creating perfect sleeping weather and zero need for air conditioning. Monsoon season hasn't started yet, so the sky stretches blue and cloudless for days at a time.

The city's adobe architecture‚Äîrequired by building codes to maintain aesthetic consistency‚Äîcreates a visual unity that makes wandering the streets feel like moving through an oil painting. Canyon Road hosts over a hundred art galleries in less than a mile. I spent an entire afternoon moving from contemporary Native American pottery to abstract expressionist paintings to bronze sculptures that played with negative space in ways that made my brain hurt pleasantly.

The Plaza, Santa Fe's historic center, has witnessed centuries of history: Native American traders, Spanish colonizers, Mexican independence, American annexation. Today it hosts jewelry vendors, street musicians, and tourists photographing the Palace of the Governors‚ÄîAmerica's oldest continuously occupied public building. The portal (covered walkway) fills with Native artists selling jewelry, pottery, and textiles under regulations requiring items be handmade by enrolled tribal members.

Santa Fe Opera, just outside town, opens its season in late June with performances in an open-air amphitheater built into the hillside. The setting sun paints the Jemez Mountains orange while singers perform in German or Italian or English, their voices carrying across the desert. I watched ""Carmen"" while wrapped in a blanket against the evening chill, drinking intermission champagne and feeling very sophisticated.

Meow Wolf‚Äîthe immersive art installation that launched a company‚Äîdefies easy description. It's part funhouse, part sci-fi narrative, part Salvador Dali fever dream. You climb through refrigerators into other dimensions, slide down secret passages, and piece together a story about interdimensional travel that may or may not make sense. Children run screaming with delight. Adults wander around saying ""What is happening?"" It works.

The food scene blends Native American, Spanish, and Mexican influences into something distinctly New Mexican. Red or green chile? That's the state question‚Äîwhether you want red or green chile sauce on everything. ""Christmas"" means both. Tomasita's serves the best sopapillas in town‚Äîpillows of fried dough dusted with powdered sugar, perfect for soaking up honey. The Shed's red chile enchiladas carry the right amount of heat: enough to make your forehead sweat slightly, not enough to make you regret your choices.

# Planning Your June Escape: Practical Magic

June 2025 brings warmer-than-average temperatures across most of the United States‚Äîgood news for outdoor adventures, essential information for packing. The national average hovers around 71¬∞F, but that encompasses everything from San Francisco's persistent 67-degree fog to Phoenix's 104-degree broiler. Know your destination's specific forecast, but generally: think layers.

National parks require advance planning. Rocky Mountain National Park uses a timed entry permit system ($2) for morning access May through October. Reservation windows open in chunks‚Äîsome available a month before, some available day-of. Set multiple alarms. Acadia requires reservations for Cadillac Summit Road sunrise access. Grand Teton doesn't require permits for day hiking, but Jenny Lake boat tickets sell out by midday.

Festival tickets vary wildly in price and availability. CMA Fest four-day passes run $275-400 depending on whether you want general admission or preferred seating. Many individual shows require separate tickets. The National Cherry Festival in Traverse City charges admission for specific events but maintains free access to the main festival grounds. Pride celebrations nationwide offer mostly free public events with ticketed parties and concerts.

The sweet spot for booking comes 2-3 months ahead of your June travels. Flights booked in April for June travel typically hit the pricing sweet spot‚Äîearly enough to avoid last-minute premiums, late enough that airlines have finalized their schedules. For accommodations in popular destinations, especially during major events, [explore your lodging options and compare package deals](https://expedia.com/affiliate/U51Zc8j) by early April to secure reasonable rates. Hotels near CMA Fest or in gateway towns to national parks can triple in price if you wait until May.

Altitude matters. Rocky Mountain National Park, Santa Fe, and parts of Wyoming sit above 5,000 feet, where altitude sickness affects even healthy travelers. Drink twice as much water as you think you need. Skip alcohol the first night. Give yourself a day to adjust before attempting strenuous hikes. Your body will appreciate the patience.

# The June You'll Remember

I've spent twenty years writing about travel, visiting countries whose names I can't properly pronounce, chasing experiences that look good in photographs. But June in America remains undefeated in its ability to surprise me.

It's the month when bison calves in Yellowstone follow their mothers across steaming thermal basins, their red fur ridiculous and perfect. When fireflies in the Great Smoky Mountains synchronize their flashing for two weeks in early June, creating a light show that predates electricity by millions of years. When college graduates flood national parks with enthusiasm and student debt, hiking trails like they're trying to prove something to themselves. Maybe they are. Maybe June is when America proves something to itself too‚Äîthat big skies and open roads and purple mountain majesties aren't just lyrics but actual, experiential truth.

The seven destinations above represent my most honest recommendations for June 2025, but here's the secret: the best place to visit is whichever one pulls at something inside you. The mountains that make you feel small in the good way. The festivals that make you remember music is a physical thing, vibration made audible. The islands where whales surface and remind you that the world holds mysteries you can witness but never fully understand.

Summer starts in June, yes, but it also starts every time you say ""yes"" to the trip you've been postponing, the adventure you've been planning in your head for months, the experience you'll remember on winter nights when summer feels impossibly far away.

Ready to turn inspiration into reality? [Search flights, accommodations, and vacation packages](https://expedia.com/affiliate/U51Zc8j) and make June 2025 the month you stopped planning and started living. The cherries in Traverse City won't harvest themselves. The orcas won't wait. The first sunrise on Cadillac Mountain happens whether you're there or not‚Äîbut wouldn't you rather be there?

May be as a response to the growing ""threat"" of the right wing which typically curtails freedom of expression legally by asserting other notions of public order, morals, and the sacred. There was an effort to create more opportunities for youth to immerse in culture. If you were a teen during those years you probably remember the free ( or almost free) concerts in Menzah6, festivals in the old Medina of Tunis, Slam and poetry events, weekly movie sessions ( youth only) downtown , photography galleries in Club Taher Haded and Belv√©d√®re, local rock concerts , human libraries etc.. a lot was happening in accessible affordable places...

 Somehow, since the ""threat"" was gone, people stopped trying. No one is doing anything anymore and most of the fun we have as locals is just going out to eat or drink. If you're trying to do anything besides consume you're basically just walking outside on such I walkable streets with barely any pavements fir for safe strolling.
So many things have been commodified s but art in the public space had pretty much been neutralized. 
Even the ""commodities"" aren't even reliable at all times with the Solaris boat station being out of service for a while now for instance... it's like we can't have nice things in this country.

I think two other reasons are probably that people are generally feeling down with no energy to organize anything anymore, thanks politics !
The other thing I can think of is most millennials with these interests either left or can't wait to leave so no one is trying to make things better here, while the younger gen z generation seems more introverted and only open to being perceived if it's monetized (so either become a TikTok star or too afraid to take any initiative). Again we have politics to thank for that . 

Are there any fun things going on that I'm simply missing out on or is this the reality of Tunis now with too much consumerism and little to no interesting community style or explorer style type of fun?",2,1760182023.0,Tunisia,0,1.0,False

For the past couple years, we've been working on an app called [Body Insights](https://bodyinsightsapp.com/) that decodes your Apple Watch data because I kept noticing things that Apple Health just doesn't tell you.

Like, I'd feel totally fine going into a workout, but my HRV was tanked and resting heart rate was 8 bpm higher than usual. Pushed through anyway and felt wrecked for three days after. Started paying attention and realized my body was screaming ""not today"" way before I felt it.

Another time I was travelling for work, sleeping in hotels, and couldn't figure out why I was exhausted even though I was getting 7+ hours of sleep. Turned out my overnight heart rate was staying elevated the whole time - stress from weird beds, room temperature, street noise - my body never actually recovered even though I was ""sleeping.""

Or when I switched my gym session from evenings to mornings and suddenly my sleep quality jumped. My evening wind-down used to start too late because workouts kept my heart rate spiked for hours. Morning sessions gave my body time to chill before bed.

That's what the app does - spots the patterns you're blind to. It tracks your Body Battery so you see when you're genuinely recharged vs just rested. Stress Score shows you which parts of your day are grinding you down (spoiler: it's not always what you think). After every workout it calculates actual recovery time based on intensity, sleep quality, and current stress - not just generic ""take 48 hours off.""

Sleep Score connects the dots: late coffee, irregular bedtime, that extra beer - it shows what's helping or sabotaging your night. Zone 2 tracking keeps your base fitness growing without burning out. Wellness alerts catch when your baselines drift before you're actually sick.

The daily dashboard answers one question: push hard today or take it easy? One glance, and you know.

No logins, no data harvesting, core features free. Just rolled out dark mode, oxygen tracking, better sleep timelines.

We got tons of amazing feedback from the community recently and we're actively working on fixes and improvements based on what everyone told us:

* Manual max HR input option so your zones are accurate
* Disable option for vibrations during scrolling (totally hear you on this one)
* Improvements to VO2max calculations, especially for HIIT training
* Celsius/Fahrenheit and Miles/Km toggle in settings
* Choice between calculated vs Apple VO2max for fitness age
* Weekly health assessment feature

Also still building: native Watch app, sleep apnea detection, health exports for doctor visits, and more..

Fixing stuff daily, but it's already completely changed how I train and recover. If you're tired of drowning in Apple Watch data with no idea what it means, this might help.

Happy to answer anything about how it works or what the metrics actually measure.

Been practicing latte art for a few months on my Legato/Turin Mi coffee and I can get decent microfoam - but it never feels like the creamy, velvety milk from a caf√©.

Some days are better than others, but as I drink, the texture turns from velvety to just milky. The last third of the drink feels kinda flat.

If I stretch too long, I get dry, bobbly milk that ruins my art. If I stretch less, it‚Äôs too thin.

‚Üí How can I get that consistent, velvety cappuccino mouthfeel like in caf√©s? (Or is it just not possible with a machine like the Micoffee?)

For context: 
- Machine: Legato / Turin Mi Coffee
- 180 ml cup / 36g out 
- 350 ml pitcher for frothing ‚Üí 600 ml for pouring
- 2 hole wand tip

I recently explored **Vellore (Tamil Nadu)** and was *blown away* by how underrated its food scene is.

1o3sw29,https://i.redd.it/gtsbaemrtguf1.jpeg,"üç´ ‚ÄúMoron‚Äù from Dagami, Leyte: The Sweet That‚Äôs Smarter Than It Sounds üòã","
When you first hear the word ‚ÄúMoron,‚Äù you might laugh a little, but in Leyte, it means something delicious, not offensive. ‚ÄúMoron‚Äù is a famous chocolate rice cake that comes from the quiet and lovely town of Dagami in the province of Leyte, Philippines.

So, what is this sweet treat all about?
Moron is made from sticky rice, coconut milk, sugar, and cocoa powder (Tablea). It is like a mix between suman, another Filipino rice delicacy, and chocolate tablea. Each piece is wrapped in banana leaves, steamed, and served warm, soft, chewy, and full of chocolate flavor.

If you are from Visayas or have Leyte roots, you have probably seen Moron as pasalubong, a gift to bring home after a trip. People love it because it is sweet, filling, and always reminds them of home.

But in Dagami, Moron is more than food. It is a part of their culture. Making Moron takes patience and teamwork. The rice is soaked and ground by hand, the coconut milk is freshly squeezed, and the banana leaves are gently heated over fire before wrapping. Some say each roll of Moron holds a piece of Dagami‚Äôs heart and the effort of the people who make it.

So, if you ever visit Leyte, make sure to drop by Dagami. Buy some freshly made Moron from the local market and enjoy it with a hot cup of coffee or chocolate. It shows that even the simplest ingredients and the funniest names can create something truly special. üíö

Fun Fact:
The best way to eat Moron is warm, with your hands, because banana leaves make everything taste better. üåøüç´

Last Sunday night I started my fast. Wrapped it up last night. Still had the same regular work week. Same dog walks. Still played hockey. Still went to the gym. It was pretty much zero calories. Throughout the 5 days, I consumed a total of 15 calories in the form of these Saltt hydration drop-ins. I got my caffeine from unsweetened tea and black coffee.

Of course, all these numbers are approximations. However, according to Fitbit, I burn around 20,500 calories and walk approximately 140,000 steps. You can also see the numbers charted on my Wyze smart scale.

Two weeks ago I shared a post about my progress with the¬†**NSA** [https://www.reddit.com/r/NorwegianSinglesRun/comments/1nvcmkn/3\_months\_doing\_nsm\_results/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NorwegianSinglesRun/comments/1nvcmkn/3_months_doing_nsm_results/), and here I am again with another update ‚Äî because this was basically my end-of-season race. I only have one cross-country 10K left in two weeks, but since it‚Äôs only partly on pavement, I doubt the result will be comparable.

So today I did another parkrun, and it felt great. I ran¬†**17:20 (3:28 min/km)**¬†‚Äî almost¬†**a minute and a half faster**¬†than my first parkrun before starting NSA back on July 12th, when I ran¬†**18:46 (3:47 min/km)**. That‚Äôs a huge PR for me, and I honestly couldn‚Äôt be happier.

I also wanted to add a few notes I missed in my previous post that might help others:

# üßÉ 1. Fuel your threshold days ‚Äî before¬†and¬†after

I only started doing this about a month ago, and the difference is massive. I feel like HR and RPE are both lower, and recovery is much better.  
I usually eat some sweets and drink a cup of coffee an hour before workouts, then have a protein shake and banana after.

# üìà 2. VO‚ÇÇmax gains without ‚ÄúVO‚ÇÇmax workouts‚Äù

My Garmin VO‚ÇÇmax went from¬†**55 ‚Üí 63**.

I haven‚Äôt done a single VO‚ÇÇmax workout, no hill sprints, no strides. Just consistent threshold running.

# üå§Ô∏è 3. Weather matters

If it‚Äôs hot, slow down ‚Äî otherwise you‚Äôll overshoot the effort. My runs got¬†*so much easier*¬†as summer ended.

# ‚è±Ô∏è 4. I didn‚Äôt follow pace calculators

I didn‚Äôt use [lactrace.com](http://lactrace.com) or other resources to set my paces. I just went by what¬†**Sirpoc**¬†mentioned in the LetsRun NSA thread ‚Äî his paces were only \~2 sec apart, so I copied the idea.  
My current training paces look like this:

* 1k reps ‚Üí¬†**3:37 min/km**
* 1.6k reps ‚Üí¬†**3:39 min/km**
* 3.2k reps ‚Üí¬†**3:44 min/km**

# üíª 5. Tracking with [Intervals.icu](http://Intervals.icu)

I use¬†[**intervals.icu**](http://intervals.icu)¬†and always update my threshold HR when the site recommends it. I set that value on my watch too.  
Threshold¬†*pace*¬†comes from my Garmin (currently 3:44/km, so I set it in [intervals.icu](http://intervals.icu) but it‚Äôs just for load calculation).  
I do all threshold work on flat routes or a track, so in [Intervals.icu](http://Intervals.icu) my model is set to¬†**pace/hr/power**.

# ü¶µ 6. No foam rolling or massage gun

Since I started NSA, I haven‚Äôt used a foam roller or massage gun¬†*once*.  
When I followed Pfitzinger, I basically couldn‚Äôt survive without them.

That‚Äôs it for this block of training ‚Äî honestly, I‚Äôm amazed how well NSA has worked for me.  
Thanks to everyone in the LetsRun thread and here on Reddit who shares insights and experiences ‚Äî it‚Äôs been super helpful.

Happy running everyone! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí®

Reconnecting with a girl I confessed to few years ago,"Three years ago, I worked at a company where I got to know a girl. We had a few coffee breaks, casual conversations‚Äînothing serious‚Äîbut I always liked her. On the last day of my job (emotions were high), I texted her on FB and told her I liked her and wanted to keep in touch. She politely declined and said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs be friends.‚Äù
I responded by ‚Äúthanks for honesty‚Äù then emotionally nuked the connection and removed her from Facebook the same day. I was trying to move on and purge everything tied to that chapter.

I recently joined a gym and saw her there. To my surprise, she recognized me instantly, remembered my name (which honestly shocked me), and even initiated a conversation while I was doing pushups. We chatted about work, our old job, current roles, etc. It was friendly and natural‚Äîno awkwardness about the past. No mention of the confession. Just‚Ä¶ normal.

The next couple of visits, we exchanged casual ‚Äúhi‚Äù and ‚Äúhow are you‚Äù moments. It‚Äôs not flirty, but it‚Äôs friendly. She doesn‚Äôt seem uncomfortable around me at all.

So the question is, how should I proceed? I‚Äôm too scared to rush things also remembering that confession and rejection day in the past and too scared to not rush, because someday she can stop showing up in the gym.

I want to sneak back to the residential facility at night and slip into the barn and pet the cat I miss so much. I don‚Äôt want to open my fridge to the moldy produce. I will take more of my stimulants today because it takes the edge off the depression and it‚Äôs easier to convince everyone I did in fact sleep and not that I just heard footsteps from upstairs and looked like I just fell asleep in my clothing . I want my dad to have a happy birthday and I want to be happy with him today. I feel like I won‚Äôt have many left with him. I want to talk about my plans to find a less stressful job but to keep the one I have now. But I am scheduled to work on Monday and I want to walk in and say I don‚Äôt want to work that day. And I don‚Äôt have a doctor‚Äôs note but I don‚Äôt want to go into the cold walk in freezer or change towel buckets or joke with my coworkers. The last shift I got upset with someone. It was the first time in my seven months or so of working there that I had a confrontation with anyone. And I think lime always, it wasn‚Äôt the message I was trying to convey, it was how I communicated it. I want to talk to the CEO of the residential I was at and ask why I was served the discharge notice in the way that I was. I want to ask why he didn‚Äôt respond to my email even though it was probably a bit rude. I want to ask my case manager if I deserved that. I don‚Äôt know why I keep coming here to write but I just kept going on and on about the same things and I want to be able to talk and joke and be peppy and myself. So I just say it over and over again and I find it doesn‚Äôt matter who I‚Äôm saying it to, it‚Äôs just the compulsion to communicate it. I was rude and confrontational and at times erratic at the facility. But I want to know if that is all I was and if all I ended up doing is making people feel hurt and relieved that I am not there anymore. 

I don‚Äôt know how to exist outside of that environment. I hope I will adapt but even when I withdrew from people there I had interactions I came to look forward to. Just sitting and watching TV and giving fist bumps to a resident there. And bringing him my free McDonald‚Äôs meal and dropping it off by his TV spot and then just running off. I want to bug the staff that I could never make sense of. But is a creature of habit and attitude and I‚Äôm waiting to have the hidden image appear out of the stereogram. And I want to ask the staff that I feel would have been such an honor to have met in another setting where a friendship would be allowed. And I want to ask her about the kittens she‚Äôs fostering and thank her again for showing me her awesome nasty patty tattoo. And I want to talk about lighthouses and look at photos of another staff member‚Äôs cat with Snapchat filters. I want to flip off the raccoons and tell them to fuck off but not to leave because I enjoy complaining about them and they are fat and silly and scary. I want to pass by the one who talks strolls and wears a sun hat and is always such a distinguished older gentleman. I want to sit and make crude jokes at 11:37 pm with people who are still awake and talk about whatever. I know I really don‚Äôt want to be back there to live forever because I don‚Äôt belong there. I don‚Äôt need that level of care. It was probably why I became so frustrated and antsy. But I don‚Äôt really enjoy my freedom. I don‚Äôt want to think about things that I will lose because I am suddenly 25 and one day I will be 26 and then 30. And I have become the person I used to look at and I would feel better about myself. And perhaps for that I deserve this. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a BPD episode or my medication or the abrupt decrease in social interaction. I just don‚Äôt want. I know that‚Äôs not a complete sentence but I just don‚Äôt wanna. I don‚Äôt feel like doing anything. I elevate my mood with increasing doses of medications and caffeine and find things to think about and be distracted by. And then it goes away and I‚Äôm back and I want to be picked up and see my mom‚Äôs old van with the sliding doors or see my dad come home when he would often work late. And that was a long time ago. I want to toe the border of the Hilton hotel in Atlantic City. Because you had to be 21 to be in the gambling area and I insisted on deviance. I was 24 the last time I went and the casino is overwhelming and smells like cigarettes and I don‚Äôt go with my mom and grandma to a restaurant and order what was likely just Kraft Mac and cheese but to me it was a divine meal. And I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt be excited things that are ahead but I just want things to stay as they are. Like in Fish Tycoon where the fish would still swim but you could pause the clock so they wouldn‚Äôt die. But I can‚Äôt do that. I want my grandmother to be able to come visit but she has a hard time leaving the house now. Going to put was the cool thing and she would sneak me a sip of her coffee and it was always sweet because she would put a packet of Sweet n‚Äô Low in it. But I feel like everything is fading and I don‚Äôt want everything to leave.",1,1760180495.0,u_PM_ME_PEDIPALPS,0,1.0,False
1o3sqrm,https://v.redd.it/poe3erx6sguf1,"Why can‚Äôt I get that velvety, foamy mouthfeel like in caf√©s?","Hey everyone,

Been practicing latte art for a few months on my Legato/Turin Mi coffee and I can get consistent microfoam ‚Äî but it never feels like the creamy, velvety milk from a caf√©.

Some days are better than others, but as I drink, the texture turns from foamy to just milky. The last third of the drink feels pretty flat.

If I stretch too long, I get dry, bubbly milk that ruins my art.
If I stretch less, it‚Äôs too thin.

‚Üí How can I get that consistent, velvety cappuccino texture like in caf√©s?
(Or is it just not possible with a home machine and steam wand?)

For context:
	‚Ä¢	Machine: Legato / Turin Mi
	‚Ä¢	180 ml cup / 36g out
	‚Ä¢	350 ml pitcher for frothing ‚Üí 600 ml for pouring

Any tips on steaming technique or workflow would be super appreciated üôè

I put some videos. It was a pain to set the shots so its not the best, but will give you a good idea.

1o3sqqv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o3sqqv,BQEYZ Frost Review ‚Äì Studio Discipline with a Warm Soul ($179),"Hey everyone, this is ADR from Electro Audio World.  
I‚Äôve been using the¬†**BQEYZ Frost**¬†for about a week now, mostly paired with my¬†**iPhone 14 Pro Max**¬†and the¬†**Apple Lightning Dongle**.  
Yeah, I know ‚Äî that‚Äôs a pretty basic setup. No fancy external DACs or amps this time.  
But honestly, that‚Äôs part of the fun. It lets you hear what these IEMs¬†*really*¬†sound like without extra coloration or EQ trickery.  
Just plug in, hit play, and find out what they can do in everyday use ‚Äî walking to work, grabbing coffee, zoning out to some music.

Later on, I‚Äôll try the Frost with a dedicated DAP and share those impressions separately.

üßä F**irst Impressions & Build**

True to its name,¬†*Frost*¬†feels cold to the touch ‚Äî solid aluminum housing with a perfectly smooth finish.  
It‚Äôs got that clean, icy sheen that catches the light without being flashy.  
Build quality is absolutely top-tier for this price: no rough edges, no weird seams, and it fits in the ear like it was made for it.

The shells are compact, seal nicely, and stay put during long sessions without creating pressure spots.  
Even the cable feels premium for its class ‚Äî soft, braided, non-microphonic, and the connectors are snug.  
It‚Äôs a small thing, but if you‚Äôre using these on your daily commute, you‚Äôll appreciate that level of refinement.

üéµ **Sound Signature**

**Smooth. Clean. Surprisingly Addictive.**

In short, Frost isn‚Äôt for bassheads or treble chasers ‚Äî it‚Äôs for people who appreciate¬†*balance*¬†and¬†*maturity*¬†in tuning.  
It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúwow‚Äù IEM that punches you with sub-bass or crispy highs right away.  
Instead, it grows on you the longer you listen.

**Bass**

Controlled, tight, and nicely textured.  
It doesn‚Äôt overwhelm the mix, yet provides enough body to give rhythm and groove.  
There‚Äôs no mid-bass bleed, and nothing gets muddy.  
It‚Äôs the kind of low end that supports the track rather than dominates it.

**Mids**

Here‚Äôs where the Frost earns its name ‚Äî smooth, neutral, with just a touch of warmth.  
Vocals are natural and correctly placed in the mix.  
Female voices (think Lana Del Rey) sound lush and creamy, while male vocals carry that studio-grade density without sounding thick.  
Even straight out of the iPhone dongle, mids retain detail and texture, which shows the drivers are doing serious work on their own.

**Treble**

Detailed but never harsh.  
You get enough air and sparkle to keep things lively, but it avoids the fatiguing sharpness that plagues many hybrids.  
Cymbals, hi-hats, and upper harmonics feel open yet smooth.  
This isn‚Äôt an analytical treble like what you‚Äôd hear from an Etymotic or Moondrop Blessing 3 ‚Äî it‚Äôs more musical, more forgiving, but still revealing.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Performance

This is where Frost punches well above its price.  
The soundstage isn‚Äôt the largest, but the imaging and separation are spot-on.  
Everything feels clean, organized, and tonally coherent.  
Transient response is fast ‚Äî not razor-sharp like some all-BA sets, but natural and consistent.

üçé iPhone + Apple Dongle Synergy

Honestly? Surprisingly good.  
Apple still uses Cirrus Logic DACs, and they pair beautifully here.  
The Frost doesn‚Äôt need much power, and the dongle drives it cleanly with great dynamics.  
Sure, a higher-end DAC or DAP would open up the stage and add a bit more sub-bass weight,  
but you‚Äôre already getting about 90% of its potential right out of the Lightning jack ‚Äî and that‚Äôs impressive.

For a daily portable setup, this combo just¬†*works*¬†‚Äî no fuss, no compromise.

üé∂ Genre Pairing

* **Acoustic / Jazz / Indie:**¬†Excellent ‚Äì fluid and emotional.
* **Pop / R&B:**¬†Balanced and enjoyable, vocals really shine.
* **Metal / EDM:**¬†Maybe a bit too polite ‚Äî lacks some slam.
* **Classical:**¬†Beautiful layering and timbre; strings sound natural.

üîÅ Comparisons

If I had to place it in context:

* Tonally close to the¬†**Letshuoer Cadenza 4**.
* Smoother and more organic than the¬†**Moondrop Aria**.
* Similar to¬†**SeeAudio Yume II**, though Frost has a softer treble roll-off.

If you chase absolute resolution, there are sharper options out there.  
But if you want something you can listen to for¬†*hours*¬†without fatigue, the Frost makes a strong case for itself.

üß© Final Thoughts

The¬†**BQEYZ Frost**¬†feels like that quiet, confident friend who doesn‚Äôt need to shout to be heard.  
It doesn‚Äôt try to wow you with exaggerated dynamics ‚Äî instead, it wins you over with¬†**consistency, finesse, and honest tonality.**  
In a world where every new IEM tries to be a marketing monster, Frost brings a refreshing dose of¬†*old-school maturity*.

Pair it with something as simple as an iPhone and Apple Dongle, and you‚Äôve got a portable, neutral, genuinely enjoyable setup.  
If you‚Äôre a detail chaser looking for the ultimate resolution, maybe look elsewhere.  
But if you value texture, warmth, and musical honesty ‚Äî Frost deserves your attention.

**TL;DR:**  
üßä Smooth & balanced tuning  
üé§ Natural mids and vocals  
üîä Tight, textured bass without bloat  
‚ö° Pairs beautifully with iPhone dongle  
üéß Best for: relaxed listening, acoustic, jazz, and vocal-heavy music

Thanks for reading ‚Äî and happy listening!

My travel was 1-month in China and 4-night stop in HK from 16th August ‚Äì 19th September 2025.

My travel route was Beijing ‚Äì Luoyang ‚Äì Dengfeng ‚Äì Kaifeng ‚Äì Chongqing ‚Äì Zhangjiajie / Wulingyuan ‚Äì Furong ‚Äì Fenghuang ‚Äì Wangxiangu ‚Äì Hengdian Film Studios ‚Äì Shanghai ‚Äì HK.

Again, I hope this information will be useful for those planning a trip to China. I‚Äôve tried to list and describe as much as possible and highlighted some important parts. I‚Äôve added AUD prices, the hotels that I stayed at, reviewed attractions that I visited in each city or town. Its my first time writing such a report and detailed itinerary so please be kind with the feedback. Feel free to ask questions and I will respond as soon as I can. Thanks for reading!


**BEIJING= 3 nights with PopMart Popland & Universal Studios**

7:30am arrival at Beijing PEK airport. Filled out a slip where I had to put my passport information and Beijing hotel address. Passport Control / Customs / Immigration didn‚Äôt ask me anything. I had an Australian passport so 30 days visa-free travel. I was out of the airport within an hour of landing, including the time to collect my suitcase at baggage claim.

**I booked an airport transfer for $36 AUD via Trip.com.** There‚Äôs no direct metro line or bus to my hotel. It would of taken x3 metro trains or a bus and a taxi to get to my hotel so this was the best (fastest & easiest) way. My driver was waiting for me at the exit with my name on a board and he drove a new, clean, comfy 6-seat air-con car. It was a quiet (driver didn‚Äôt talk to me) but pleasant 35min ride ‚Äì no traffic on this Saturday morning.

I dropped off my suitcase at **Jinglanting Hotel, 3 night stay was $201 AUD.** Its about 5min walk to Wanshengdong metro station. No breakfast included or provided but there are a few local eateries within 2min walk, a convenient store, McDonald's around the corner etc. There were other foreigners staying here and other hotels nearby as well. Look on Trip.com. I chose this hotel because of its location, 10min metro ride to Universal Studios / Citywalk, and price.

I caught the metro to the meeting point for my 10am dumplings cooking class, pre-booked on Klook. I had already spoken to the host via WeChat, beforehand, so she was aware I might be late or had to reschedule depending on my flight. I got back to the hotel around 5pm, unpacked, had a shower, then caught the metro to Universal Citywalk for dinner and shopping. There was a cool pop-up minions store with awesome items and the Universal Studios store had a bit of everything from each attraction.

The next day, I caught the metro and changed lines, a few times, to Zaoying metro station, Exit B for **PopMart Land theme park.** I booked the entry ticket on Trip.com. 2hrs ‚Äì 3hrs is plenty here, as part of the theme park was closed for renovations. It was cute, more for kids or big kids like me. I especially enjoyed visiting the attractions underneath the castle. You can get a free stamp booklet to collect the stamps around the theme park, watch some live performances, there‚Äôs a cafe, restaurant, food trucks etc. The most disappointing thing were the blind boxes. I ended up getting two from the vending machine, not from the main store inside the castle. Then I headed to Chaoyang Joy City Mall for lunch, shopping and dinner.

The day after was spent at **Universal Studios = I bought the 5-ride express pass via Klook for $407 AUD**. It only cost another $30 AUD more than the 3-ride express pass. **Note: prices change depending on exchange rate, availability and demand.** As it was school holidays, I didn‚Äôt want to risk not getting on some of the rides hence I bought the 5-ride express pass, but the 3-ride express pass would have been enough on the day that I went, a Monday. There were a few rides that remained at 120min+ wait throughout the day so I thought it was worth spending the extra money. But if we‚Äôre talking about value for money, Universal Studios Osaka is much better ‚Äì I paid $322 AUD for entry and the all-express pass for October 2024 entry and visited during Halloween (this was before Donkey Kong land opened).

Anyways, I joined the queue at Universal Studios main gate around 7:45am. My passport was scanned and I entered around 8:45am. **There‚Äôs a board near the entry with several qr codes. I scanned one for the map, ride queuing times, show schedules etc, via WeChat.** I monitored this regularly throughout the day and I went on the following rides and watched the following shows, in this order:

* **Jurassic Flyers** ‚Äì I liked the views and set up along the queuing area, I waited 10min to get on... otherwise skip it.

* **Jurassic World Adventure** ‚Äì highly recommend.
* **Decepticoaster** ‚Äì always had a 120+ waiting time throughout the day so express pass was good for this one.

* **Battle for the All Spark** ‚Äì go on it.

* **Kung Fu Panda Journey of the Dragon Warrior boat ride** ‚Äì I went twice as I had time, no queues and just ate!

* **Flight of Hippogriff**‚Äì exactly like the one in Universal Studios Osaka, so skip if you don't have time.

* **Despicable Me Mayhem** ‚Äì so cute and fun, but for some reason I enjoyed the Osaka one more.

* **watched Sing Tour show** ‚Äì I wanted to sit down for a bit and enjoy some air-con HAHA its all right, for kids.

* **watched Lights Camera & Action show**‚Äì you stand and watch, 5-10min experience so I didn‚Äôt mind it.

* **watched How to Train a Dragon show** ‚Äì worth watching for the dragon as it ‚Äúflies‚Äù above the audience.

* **watched Waterworld show** ‚Äì exactly like the Osaka one, but in Chinese and they purposely try to get you wet here!

* **Loop-dee-doo** ‚Äì located indoors so it gives you a nice break from the sun... a cute kiddy ride.

* **Super Swirly** ‚Äì located indoors, so it gives you a nice break from the sun‚Ä¶ a cute kiddy ride.

* **HP Forbidden Journey** ‚Äì one of my favourites and I‚Äôm not a crazy HP fan, I‚Äôve seen all the movies once.

* **watched 8pm Hogwarts Castle night light show** ‚Äì there‚Äôs not a lot of space / area to stand and admire the lights...

I managed to walk around the entire theme park twice: one for all the rides, shows and take day time photos, then again for night time photos when everything is lit up. I was out of the theme park around 9pm, buggered. **Would I come back to this Universal Studios, again? No, I‚Äôd rather go back to Universal Studios, Osaka for the price / value. I went to Universal Studios, Beijing, mainly for Transformers and its on my bucket list to visit all the Universal Studios in the world.**

**FYI, selfie sticks are not allowed in Universal Citywalk or Universal Studios. At the security bag check point, staff will ask you to put your selfie stick in a small locker for 20 yuan, which is located closer to the metro station; or they will take it off you; or you bin it. You can bring umbrellas, bottled water, and snacks.** Merchandise was disappointing. I only bought the gold Transformers decepticons and autobots keyrings for 79 yuan.

This was my third time to Beijing so I didn‚Äôt visit any of the main city attractions like the Forbidden City or Great Wall etc.



**LUOYANG = 4 nights** but I wished I had one more night because its a really amazing and beautiful city. I will return!

I caught a 50min direct metro train to Beijing South Station for 7 yuan, then a 3hr train ride to Luoyang Longmen train station for $102 AUD ‚Äì booked via Trip.com. I navigated the metro and walked about 10mins to my hotel. **I stayed at Gudu Yuijing Hotel for 4 nights = $160 AUD including daily Asian-style breakfast which was very good, especially considering the price.** I would definitely stay here again. Very spacious, modern rooms and excellent service. Look on Trip.com The only time that any hotel reception staff questioned me, was at this hotel: they asked me, where did I come from? (Beijing) and where was I going to next? (Dengfeng), and they noted it all down. I‚Äôm assuming it was to register me at the local police station. No other hotel in China asked me these questions. Then, the hotel staff asked if I had a mobile phone number and I told them I had WeChat. I scanned their qr code, we became ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and I spoke to the staff via WeChat for the rest of my time here. They were professional and helpful ‚Äì I dropped off my dirty clothes in a bag at the reception and they got it washed, dried and put it in my room. **Laundry was free at all the hotels that I stayed at in China. Majority of the hotel staff would take the bag of clothes, wash, dry and put it in my room.**

I walked around 30min to most attractions from my hotel; I caught the metro a few times; and a taxi a few times as it was so hot and humid (46 degrees humidity) ‚Äì I needed to conserve energy where I could. I ran out of time and energy to go to Mingtang Heavenly Hall & Tiantang Hall of Enlightenment / Wuzetian‚Äôs Palace. I visited the following places in Luoyang:

**Yingtianmen Gate & Que Tower with 1hr Tang Palace Banquet Show.** Booked via Trip.com ‚Äì great show, just like in the Chinese dramas, and you get light snacks, fruit and tea. This is a must visit place as you get wonderful sunset and night light views of the city on one side of the gate and Mingtang & Tiangting on the other side. There‚Äôs a few museums inside, and you can rent hanfu (traditional outfits) here too. Its a very popular attraction as you will see hundreds of girls and professional photographers here, taking photos, every 5 metres. It was a crazy, crowded and overwhelming sight but interesting at the same time. 2hrs plus the 1hr show should be enough time to visit here. You don‚Äôt have to watch the show you can just buy tickets to enter the gate. There is a small night food stall market right opposite the gate, good for dinner.

**Tianzi Jialiu Museum / Eastern Zhou Royal Horse & Chariots Pits & Luoyang Museum.** Booked via Trip.com ‚Äì both are worth visiting, if you have time. I had issues getting into both, was delayed by 5min-10min at each museum. I had to speak to someone via Trip.com then through WeChat then with the museum staff to let me in. Luoyang Museum is extremely popular with Chinese tourists. I got there at 11am, lined up for 15min, security bag check, entered and wandered around two massive floors til 3pm. There‚Äôs a very popular section with the ‚Äútwo girls holding hands pottery figurine‚Äù - a long queue of girls dressed in hanfu (traditional outfit) wanting to take pictures with them. It was nice seeing young people at this museum, lots of families with kids, not many foreigners as its hard to get tickets to enter.

**Luoyi Ancient City.** It was bigger than I expected! I spent about 4hrs here ‚Äì got lost in the alleyways and was souvenir shopping. There was an 8pm 5min performance where a girl dressed in hanfu (traditional outfit) appears on ropes, high up from a building, she glides towards the pond area and scatters glitter confetti at everyone below. It was a moment where I felt like I was transported back to Ancient China. Really surreal, unexpected, captivating. I recommend coming here at night for all the lights, d√©cor and atmosphere. You do have to pay an entry fee, 10 yuan. I had trouble scanning their qr code to pay via Alipay, WeChat then some website. So the staff tried to help me, they gave up after 10mins then let me in for free HAHA

Luoyi Ancient City was the only place in China that I had issues with the internet, accessing Alipay and WeChat. Every time I wanted to pay for at item in the stores, I couldn't connect so I paid with cash. As soon as I stepped out of the store and onto the footpath, I had internet again. It was very strange. From this experience, I suggest having some cash with you. It may come in handy.

**Jiuzhou Pond with 1hr Phoenix Dance in the Divine Capital outdoor stage show.** Booked via Trip.com ‚Äì incredible show! I highly recommend this one. I was very impressed with all the lights, special effects, huge cast, costumes, real horses came on stage, the backdrop was so beautiful. Try to arrive about 2hrs before the show so you can enjoy the gardens, toilet stop, grabs snacks and drinks, then find your seat for the show. I will return and watch this show again.

**Lijingmen Gate / Ancient Town, West Street & Cross Street night market.** I spent 3hrs here. Its similar to Luoyi Ancient City but smaller and no pond. There‚Äôs more food and drink places than souvenir shops. You will see many Wanjingxiang Peony Cakes being sold ‚Äì Henan‚Äôs speciality, lots of flavours to choose from. I sampled one, its too sweet for me.

**New Metropolis Mall & Dannisi David Mall.** quick stop to see what Luoyang malls are like and for a dinner.

**Guanlin Temple.** I visited with a guide. It was a really nice 90min visit. While visiting temples in Henan province, I got to see many and purchase some uniquely designed incense sticks. I don‚Äôt remember seeing such incense sticks in other Asian countries ‚Äì there‚Äôs usually just the one type = tan coloured incense stick with a thin, red bamboo handle. Incense sticks vary from 10 yuan to 200 yuan. There‚Äôs even free incense sticks at some temples: look for a sign that says something along the lines ‚Äúonly take what you need‚Äù. You pray with 3 incense sticks at Chinese temples.

**Longmen Grottoes.** I visited with a guide. I spent nearly 4hrs here, 4pm to 8pm and saw it light up at night. Yes, it was very crowded as it was school holidays. I found it handy to have a guide here as they helped take photos for you ‚Äì its hard to when its so crowded and no-one uses selfie sticks in China (well, I saw one or two, here and there, among the hundreds of people you pass by every day at the touristy areas) and give you good, honest advice. For example, there are many walkways that led to caves in Longmen Grottoes. My guide told me, there‚Äôs nothing to see in that cave over there! I didn‚Äôt believe her so I climbed, like 300 stairs, got to this cave and it was empty! She was right. I thought she might of lied to me because she didn‚Äôt want to climb all those stairs or show me everything here (as a tourist, a first time visitor, you want to see everything, right?). If I had listened to her, I could of saved 15min of my time! This year, the Longmen Grottoes was only lit up with yellow golden lights. My guide said they stopped using coloured lights as they were concerned it would damaged the caves, statues, relics, etc. over time. Coloured lights were used last year... Google it.



**DENGFENG = 2 nights**

The same guide took me to White Horse Temple, Shaolin Temple and Zhongyue Temple in one day, then drop me off at my Dengfeng hotel. **I stayed at Borrman Hotel for 2 nights = $64 AUD.** Its a very simple, modern hotel with spacious rooms. Look on Trip.com. I didn‚Äôt pay for the hotel breakfast ‚Äì its a 5min walk from the hotel to a main road with lots of eateries.

Unfortunately, it rained heavily on the first night and was so foggy / cloudy on the second day, I decided not to waste time visiting Songshan (Mount Song). The top half of Songshan wasn‚Äôt visible at all from the ground and I was very sad. I was looking forward to the cliff path walk. Oh well, it gives me a reason to return! So, I explored the attractions at the bottom of the mountain instead. I caught a taxi everywhere in Dengfeng, fast and cheap. I paid around 10 yuan per taxi ride, not DiDi, in Dengfeng except to get to the Zen Ritual Shaolin Show which cost about 30 yuan, one way. There‚Äôs no metro and I didn‚Äôt want to try catching the bus to save a few dollars. I walked 20min from my hotel to Dengfeng bus station to get to Kaifeng. I visited the following places in Dengfeng:

**White Horse Temple and the other temples nearby.** I visited with a guide. I was here during school holidays and it was also an auspicious date so it was packed. Arrived by 9am, stayed about 70mins or so. Worth visiting for the history of how and where Buddhism was introduced to China.

**Shaolin Temple with 30min Kungfu show and Pagoda Forest.** I visited with a guide. With the show, I read a lot of negative reviews so I had low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised ‚Äì it was good. The audience can participate ‚Äì maybe they were actors? Regardless, the show was fun, funny thus enjoyable. There was a segment where the Shaolin monks throw needles through a sheet of glass to pop a balloon ‚Äì they hit the balloon, two out of eight times. It was real, live martial arts demonstrations. Now, if I didn‚Äôt have a guide with me, I would have needed more time to figure out where to go because there were many footpaths and not enough signs to direct you, which meant I couldn‚Äôt have visited all the places that I wanted to in a short amount of time. 2hrs-3hrs is needed for Shaolin Temple, and it depends if you can get a seat for the show as it only seats about 300 people, many were standing in the stairways or doorways to watch.

**Zhongyue Temple.** I was with a guide. I read somewhere, Zhongyue Temple is a place of worship for the mountain god of Taishi Mountain; its considered as the crown of Central Plains temples; the largest (covering an area nearly 110,000 square metres in size) and oldest intact building complex among the Five Holy Mountains of China. Its often considered as the sixth paradise of Taoism, and is modelled after Beijing‚Äôs Forbidden City. So, I wanted to check it out. There were only a handful of people when I arrived here around 4:30pm. It‚Äôs worth visiting and it was a very memorable experience for me.

Towards the back of the temple, there are two very long halls showcasing probably 100 different religious colourful statues, something that I wasn‚Äôt expecting! I walked along the halls and greeted them all: Ni Hao! And, I saw a deer here! My guide has never seen a deer at a temple before, so she had to research about it while I took photos. Supposedly, the Chinese believe that deer represents longevity, prosperity, good fortune, etc. My guide was very pleased with this and said the deer is a sign for us: we‚Äôre blessed! 1hr is plenty of time to wander around this temple, explore all the halls and look for the deer!

**1hr Zen Ritual Shaolin Show on an outdoor stage with Songshan (Mount Song) as the backdrop.** What made this show different from others, is the music and it wasn‚Äôt just dance and singing. There was martial arts, animal ‚Äì like cows, goats and sheep brought onto the stage too. I wouldn‚Äôt mind watching it again. Yes, I like my shows!

**Dayucheng Mall.** This is your typical mall. Nothing special.. I went here for lunch and wandered around then froze in shock disbelief when I saw a skill-tester / claw machine with real live fish in it! I watched a boy scoop out a fish and take it away, instead of a plush animal toy, figurine or mobile phone! I‚Äôve never seen this before so it was a highlight for me.

**Dayucheng night market.** This is right outside the mall and next to about 30 food trucks. I had dinner here and a very interesting walk through the stalls selling snacks to fashion accessories to lafufus to animals (pets).

**Fawang Temple.** Its an absolutely gorgeous temple, especially the last temple hall at the top. 1hr is needed here.

**Songyang Pagoda.** Its worth visiting due to the history about this place and how it was built. 30min is plenty.

**Songyang Academy.** As I walked around, I wished this was what my high school looked like. Much prettier than the buildings we have now. 1hr is enough time here.




**KAIFENG = 3 nights** but I wished I had another two nights here. I will return!

I took a 3hr 30-seat bus from Dengfeng to Kaifeng for 42 yuan. The ride was safe and the bus was clean, comfortable but old ‚Äì no air-con, the windows were kept open. **I bought my long-distance bus ticket online, two days in advance. I used my guide‚Äôs mobile phone number to complete the transaction as I had an eSim. You need a Chinese mobile number to book long-distance bus tickets online (or buy at the ticket office but I didn‚Äôt want to wait and risk missing a seat on the bus that I needed). When you get to the bus station, look for the ticket office, show them your booking number and passport, then they give you a paper ticket. Find the entry point and get your bags scanned, like at the train stations and airports. To save time, I looked for a staff member and showed him my ticket, who pointed at the bus that I needed to catch. As I headed to the bus, another staff member approached me, checked my ticket then took my suitcase and put it in the luggage compartment while I hopped in. You can sit anywhere on the bus, it wasn‚Äôt allocated seating so arrive early so you can sit towards the front ‚Äì I find its often bumpier at the back of the bus.**

The bus picked up lots of passengers along the way and dropped people off at random intersections or at red traffic light stops ‚Äì not an official bus stop. I got off the bus on a main road and had to wheel myself to safety ‚Äì onto a footpath. Its a bit dangerous‚Ä¶ Then, I jumped into a taxi to get to my hotel called **Songchao Bianjing Hotel (Kaifeng Drum Tower Square branch) for 3 nights = $123 AUD including daily soybean drinks and a snack between 10pm-12am, delivered to my room by a robot, every night.** This hotel was tucked away, hidden behind other buildings, on a main street. You had to walk through a metal-barred gate and car-park to reach the hotel. The room was clean, modern etc. I would stay here again. Foreigners stay here too. Look on Trip.com and check the reviews.

There were no metros here and I didn‚Äôt want to waste time figuring out how to catch the bus so I caught a taxi everywhere, not DiDi. The most that I paid was 15 yuan for a ride and it was a 30min walk to reach many attractions. I visited the following places in Kaifeng:

**Daxiangguo Temple.** This temple is considered one of the top ten famous temples in China. It has a really nice koi fish pond, several halls to explore, a vegetarian restaurant and a shop. I recommending visiting here. I saw foreigners here too. 1hr-2hrs is enough.

**Yanqing Taoist Temple.** I stopped here for 45min as it was along my walking route. What made this temple special were the temple roofs, an underground passage with a worship hall and big ying-yang symbol on the ground. Photos of how this temple looked like over the years, from the Yuan Dynasty = 13th to 14th Century til now, with various renovations and expansions are displayed around the complex. The central three-storey tower is made of brick but designed to look like wood and it has a unique Mongolian style yurt-roof. Many visitors prayed here and with huge incense sticks!

**Memorial Temple of Lord Bao.** Lord Bao Zheng was a famous, well-respected, honest and upright official in the Northern Song Dynasty. There are many TV shows and movies about him. You will need about 2hrs to explore this place as there are also several halls with lots of artefacts, a wax museum with lifelike figures recreating scenes from some of Lord Bao‚Äôs legendary court cases, a garden with rock sculptures and ponds, snack stalls, and a lovely river-view area at the back. If you have time, drop by‚Ä¶

**Starlight New World Shopping Mall.** This mall is massive. I came here for dinner, coffee and to stock up on snacks for the next few days. Its a bit out of the way, not close to any tourist attractions, so only visit if you have time.

**Gulou Night Market & Drum Tower.** Highly recommend coming here at night. You will need 3hrs+ to enjoy this market as there are many stalls selling lots of different items, street shops behind the stalls and to explore the huge food section with outdoor seating. The Drum Tower is wonderfully lit up at night and cars do drive through it. This was the most memorable night market experience for me in China, on this trip. Its about a 15min walk from my hotel and I visited this market, twice.

**Millennium City Park theme park.** One of the reasons I wanted to visit Kaifeng was for this place and it became one of my favourite days of the trip! I bought my ticket on Trip.com and it included entry to the Song Dynasty Dongjing Dreaming Show which had fireworks at the end too. The design of this theme park is inspired by a 5.25 metre long hand-scroll painting called Riverside Scenes at Qingming Festival or Along the River during the Qingming Festival by Zhang Zeduan, a famous artist of the Northern Song Dynasty. This painting is considered a masterpiece, a treasure, among all Chinese paintings as it captures the daily life of people ‚Äì from the rich to the poor, and the landscape of the capital, Bianjing (present day Kaifeng). FYI, Kaifeng is one of the eight ancient capitals of China and its really worth visiting (this 5A theme park and the city itself).

I was in this theme park for nearly 12hrs and I didn‚Äôt see everything. I watched many skit, street and folklore performances, live cockfighting, several outdoor stage shows, saw people play ancient card games and eat traditional handmade candy. All the staff are dressed up in hanfu (traditional outfit) and the place is designed like an ancient town with a pagoda, pedestrian bridges, dragon boats you can ride along the river, shops, restaurants, a market area, scenic walkways, a petting zoo for the kids, a water-park (great place to cool down), indoor theatre, museums... you can also rent hanfu (traditional outfit) to take photos here too. As you wander through the theme park, its like you‚Äôve been transported back into time‚Ä¶ I highly recommend spending a full day here if you can. Consider this like the Chinese version of Universal Studios & Disney combined but with no rides.

**Imperial Street of Song Dynasty.** I wandered along this street around 10am and it was very quiet. Not many shops were open and its a bit run down. I think this street been kept for historical or cultural reasons. A quick 15min walk through and to get to the Dragon Pavilion is enough time to say you‚Äôve been here, ticked it off the list ‚Äì if you want to.

**Dragon Pavilion / Longting.** I spend about 2hrs here. This was the royal palace for many dynasties and its been rebuilt as a tourist park. If you walk up the 72 steps of the main building ‚Äì Dragon Pavilion, you will get a nice panoramic view of the area; its surrounded by a wide lake, antique pavilions and you can see the modern side of the city in the distance. There‚Äôs a lotus pond, garden area, several side-halls which are now wax work museums, an island with a tea-house. I visited in the morning and it wasn‚Äôt crowded. I read this park holds a chrysanthemum festival here, every autumn, and I think it would be very beautiful place to visit.

**Wanshuishanwuxiacheng / Wansui Mountain Martial Arts City theme park.** I stumbled across this attraction whilst searching what to visit in Kaifeng, on Trip.com. Its similar to Millennium City Park but is designed with a fantasy theme instead. If you watch Xianxia shows, this is an absolute must visit! There are also a few rides here, but more for the kids. I spent 5hrs here and it wasn‚Äôt enough time ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt get to watch any of the shows as all the tickets were sold out by the time I arrived. I will need to come back to fully experience what this theme park has to offer. I did enjoy wandering around all the different themed areas and watched some 20min outdoor performances, a steam-punk inspired parade (a bit out of theme, I know).

I didn‚Äôt have time to visit some other attractions such as Kaifeng Museum, Kaifengu, Tianbo Yang Mansion, Han Yuan Stele Forest, Shan Shan Gan Guild Hall, Ancient City Wall, and the Iron Pagoda. So, I will return to Kaifeng‚Ä¶ I really enjoyed my time in Henan province.

""Just a few more hours,"" I whispered. ""Until tonight.""¬†

Tonight was everything. No more going back to that house. No more pretending they were family.¬†

I'd already asked for time off work. My boss spat at me. Called me lazy. Typical. Omegas always got the worst treatment.¬†

But I didn't care tonight.¬†

I was going to Gabriel's. My boyfriend. Soon-to-be fianc√©.¬†

Tomorrow was the Lunar Assembly. Sacred ceremony. Wolves finding their mates under the Moon Goddess. Tomorrow was also my eighteenth birthday. Finally old enough.¬†

Gabriel promised we'd bond tomorrow. I could escape forever.¬†

Gabriel. Rich. Gorgeous. An Alpha's brother. Sure, I was just an omega. But Gabriel said bloodlines didn't matter. Love mattered.¬†

I practically skipped toward his house. My heart hammered with excitement. Beautiful stone building in the center of town. So much better than our pathetic wooden shack. Soon I'd live here. With Gabriel. Forever.¬†

I knocked eagerly.¬†

Nothing.¬†

My smile faltered. That's... odd. Gabriel said he'd be waiting. He promised.¬†

I tried the handle. Unlocked. Relief flooded through me. He must be inside. Maybe preparing a surprise?¬†

""Gabriel? It's me!"" I called out cheerfully.¬†

Silence.¬†

Wait. What was that? Sounds from upstairs. My heart lifted again. He was home after all.¬†

Then I heard it clearly.¬†

Laughter.¬†

Female laughter.¬†

Moaning.¬†

My world stopped spinning. No. No, that couldn't be‚Äî¬†

My feet moved on their own. Step by step. Up the stairs. Each step felt like walking to my execution.¬†

The sounds grew louder. Clearer. Destroying me with every breath.¬†

Gasps. Bed springs creaking. A voice that made my soul shatter.¬†

""Oh God, Gabriel... right there...""¬†

Valerie. My stepsister.¬†

My brain refused to process it. This wasn't happening. This was a nightmare. I'd wake up any second.¬†

The bedroom door hung slightly open. Like a cruel invitation to witness my destruction. I saw them.¬†

Gabriel's muscled back. Moving. Valerie's pale body beneath him. Her golden hair fanned across his pillow like a victory flag.¬†

No no no no no.¬†

""You feel so much better than I imagined,"" Gabriel panted.¬†

My heart exploded into a thousand pieces. Each word was a dagger.¬†

Valerie laughed. That cruel, sharp sound I knew so well. ""Better than that pathetic omega sister of mine, I bet. Poor little Sera probably doesn't even know what to do with a real man.""¬†

The air left my lungs. I couldn't breathe. Couldn't think. Could only feel the agony ripping through my chest.¬†

""Don't."" Gabriel's voice was rough. ""Don't mention her when we're like this.""¬†

""Why not?"" Valerie's fingers traced his spine like she owned him. ""After tomorrow, she'll know exactly where she stands. An omega like her could never satisfy you.""¬†

Each word was a physical blow. I stumbled backward, gasping for air. My shoulder slammed into the wall. The sound echoed like a gunshot.¬†

""What was that?"" Valerie hissed.¬†

My wolf surged forward. Rage I'd never felt before. My foot connected with the door. It crashed against the wall.¬†

""WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?""¬†

They jumped apart. Gabriel nearly fell off the bed scrambling for his pants. Valerie just sat up. Didn't even cover herself.¬†

""Seraphina!"" Gabriel went white. ""I can explain‚Äî""¬†

""Explain?"" My voice cracked. ""Explain how you're screwing my sister?""¬†

""It's not what you think‚Äî""¬†

""IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THINK!"" Tears streamed down my face. ""You lying, cheating bastard!""¬†

Valerie stretched. Finally reached for Gabriel's shirt. ""Oh, sister dear. You really thought he'd choose you?"" She tilted her head. Mock sympathy. ""How cute.""¬†

""Valerie, don't,"" Gabriel warned. But his voice was weak.¬†

""Don't what? Tell her the truth?"" Valerie stood up slowly. ""That Mom and Dad have known about us for months? That they practically threw me at Gabriel because they were embarrassed by their precious Alpha family being tied to an omega reject?""¬†

The world spun. ""You're lying.""¬†

""Am I?"" Valerie moved to the mirror. Ran her fingers through her hair. ""Why don't you go home and ask them? I'm sure they're waiting. Probably with our engagement announcement.""¬†

""Sera, listen‚Äî"" Gabriel finally got his pants on. ""This doesn't have to change anything between us. We can still be friends‚Äî""¬†

""FRIENDS?"" I lunged toward him. He caught my wrists.¬†

""You need to calm down,"" he said. His grip was tight. Bruising. ""Think about your position. Your family. You don't want to make this worse.""¬†

I stared into his eyes. Eyes that had whispered promises just days ago. Now they were cold. Calculating.¬†

""Let go of me,"" I whispered.¬†

""Sera‚Äî""¬†

""LET GO OF ME!""¬†

I wrenched free and ran. I burst through our front door. Victor and Elizabeth sat calmly in the living room. An elegant invitation lay on the coffee table between them.¬†

They showed no surprise at my tear-stained face.¬†

""You already knew?"" My voice was barely a whisper.¬†

""Seraphina, sit down."" Victor's voice was ice. ""Yes, we know about Gabriel and Valerie. We fully support it.""¬†

Elizabeth picked up the invitation. Held it out. ""This is their engagement announcement. Tomorrow at the Lunar Assembly, Gabriel will propose to Valerie. They hope you'll attend as Valerie's sister.""¬†

I stared at the beautiful invitation. Gabriel and Valerie's names in gold. The silver Nightshadow crest. It was all real.¬†

""Why?"" My voice cracked. ""Why would you do this to me?""¬†

""Enough!"" Victor shot to his feet. Backhanded me across the face. Hard. I crashed to the floor. My cheek burned.¬†

""You're nothing but an abandoned child we took in out of pity. What right do you have to insult our daughter?""¬†

""You should be grateful we raised you."" Elizabeth's voice was cold. ""Now you know your place. Tomorrow you'll bless your sister's engagement. Then find yourself a suitable omega mate.""¬†

""I won't!"" I struggled to my feet. Tasted blood. ""I'll never bless this betrayal!""¬†

Victor raised his hand again. This time I was ready. I dodged and ran for the door.¬†

""Get out of our house!"" Elizabeth shrieked behind me. ""Ungrateful little brat!""¬†

I fled into the night. Running blindly. Tears falling like broken pearls.¬†

I didn't know where I was going; I only knew I couldn't stop moving or the crushing pain would swallow me whole. I didn't know how long I ran, but eventually I found myself on Main Street when a familiar voice made me stop.¬†

""Sera!""¬†

I spun around to see Ophelia running toward me, her dark hair flying behind her.¬†

""I saw you run in‚Äîwhat happened? You look like you've seen a ghost.""¬†

*1*

""Worse."" I collapsed into her arms. ""I've seen the truth.""¬†

""Tell me.""¬†

So I did. Every horrible detail, every cruel word. Ophelia held me while I shook.¬†

""Those bastards,"" she hissed when I finished. ""All of them. Gabriel, Valerie, your so-called parents.""¬†

""What am I going to do?"" I cried against her shoulder. ""Tomorrow is the Lunar Assembly. Everyone will see Gabriel and Valerie's engagement. I'll be the laughingstock of the entire pack.‚Äù¬†

""Listen to me, Sera."" Ophelia stroked my hair gently. ""We're not waiting for that damned ceremony. Tonight, we're going to Silver Moon Harbor!‚Äù¬†

""What?"" I pulled back to look at her, still having tears on my face.¬†

""I heard there's a huge party in Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Lots of wolves from other packs who are here for tomorrow's ceremony will be there."" Ophelia's eyes sparkled with excitement. ""We're going to have some fun and forget all about these bastards and your heartless family!‚Äù¬†

""But... but I..."" I hesitated. As an omega, Silver Moon Harbor was completely foreign territory to me.¬†

""But what?"" Ophelia gripped my hands. ""Sera, you've lost everything here. Instead of staying to be humiliated tomorrow, let's go to Silver Moon Harbor and try our luck. Maybe you'll meet your real destined mate‚Äîsomeone who won't give a damn about your bloodline.‚Äù¬†

I looked into Ophelia's determined eyes, thinking about the cruel words I'd heard in Gabriel's bedroom, remembering my parents' cold faces, imagining the humiliation I'd face tomorrow‚Ä¶¬†

""Okay."" I wiped away my tears, feeling a fierce courage I'd never experienced before. ""Let's go to Silver Moon Harbor tonight. Let all those people go to hell!‚Äù¬†

Ophelia grinned with delight. ""Now that's my Seraphina! Come on, let's go back to my place and get ready. Tonight, we're going to show the most beautiful girl!""¬†

# Chapter 2: Chapter 2

¬†

Seraphina's POV¬†

Ophelia dragged me back to her small apartment above the bakery, her eyes blazing with determination. ""We're not letting those bastards win,"" she declared, pulling out makeup and rifling through her closet.¬†

She spun around, holding up an emerald green dress that perfectly matched my eyes. ""Tonight, we show them what they lost.""¬†

*1*

The dress was beautiful‚Äîsilky and elegant, with a flowing skirt that hugged my curves in all the right places.¬†

As Ophelia worked on my makeup, carefully applying smoky eyeshadow that made my green eyes pop, I felt something shifting inside me.¬†

""There,"" Ophelia stepped back, admiring her handiwork. ""Now you look like the goddess you are.""¬†

I barely recognized myself in the mirror. The woman staring back at me looked confident, mysterious, beautiful. Nothing like the broken omega who'd fled Gabriel's house just hours ago.¬†

""Come on,"" Ophelia grabbed my hand. ""Silver Moon Harbor awaits.""¬†

""I can't believe we're actually doing this,"" I whispered as we approached the grand entrance.¬†

""Believe it, honey,"" Ophelia grinned, straightening her own dress and passed me a mask. ""Tonight, we're not wolves from nowhere. Tonight, we're mysterious beauties who belong wherever we damn well please.""¬†

The ballroom took my breath away. Crystal chandeliers cast rainbow patterns across marble floors, and hundreds of werewolves in elegant attire mingled beneath soaring ceilings. Everyone wore elaborate masks, adding an air of mystery to the already intoxicating atmosphere.¬†

""Holy shit,"" I breathed, then immediately covered my mouth.¬†

She pressed two tequila shots into my hands, raising her own. ""To new beginnings and leaving the past in the dust!""¬†

The alcohol burned down my throat, but it was a good burn‚Äîcleansing, like it was washing away the bitter taste of betrayal. Ophelia immediately ordered two more.¬†

""I don't usually drink this much,"" I protested weakly.¬†

""You don't usually find your boyfriend screwing your sister either,"" she pointed out. ""Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures.""¬†

By the third round, I was feeling deliciously dizzy and incredibly free. The pain was still there, but muffled now, wrapped in cotton and shoved into a corner of my mind.¬†

""Dance with me,"" Ophelia pulled me toward the crowded dance floor, and for the first time in hours, I smiled genuinely.¬†

We lost ourselves in the music, spinning and laughing like we didn't have a care in the world. Other wolves watched us with interest, but I was too caught up in the moment to care. This was what freedom felt like.¬†

When a slow song began to play, I was about to suggest we get some air when I felt a warm hand capture mine.¬†

I turned, and my breath caught in my throat.¬†

The man standing before me wore an elegant silver mask that covered the upper half of his face, but what I could see was devastating. Strong jaw, sensual lips curved in a slight smile, and eyes... God, those eyes. They were the deepest blue I'd ever seen, so dark they were almost black, but when the light hit them just right, they seemed to shimmer with silver.¬†

""The most beautiful woman in the room wouldn't refuse a dance, would she?"" His voice was like aged whiskey‚Äîsmooth, rich, with just enough roughness to make my pulse skip.¬†

I should have said no. Should have remembered that I was hurting, that I'd just had my heart shattered. Instead, I found myself placing my hand in his and letting him lead me onto the dance floor.¬†

""Why not?"" I heard myself say. ""Let's dance.""¬†

He was tall‚Äîat least six and a half feet‚Äîwith broad shoulders that filled out his expensive suit perfectly. When he pulled me close, I could feel the solid warmth of his chest, the careful strength in his hands as one settled on my waist and the other cradled my palm.¬†

""I've been watching you since you walked in,"" he murmured near my ear, his breath sending shivers down my spine. ""You're absolutely captivating.""¬†

The compliment should have felt empty‚Äîwe were strangers, after all‚Äîbut something in his voice made it feel genuine.¬†

""You're not from around here, are you?"" I found myself asking, tilting my head back to look into those mesmerizing eyes.¬†

""What gave me away?"" There was amusement in his voice, and I could see his lips curve into a more genuine smile.¬†

""You don't feel... local."" It was hard to explain, but his scent was different from the wolves I'd grown up with. Richer, more complex.¬†

""Very perceptive."" His hand on my waist tightened slightly, drawing me closer until there was barely an inch of space between us. ""I'm here for friends. I would have arrived sooner.""¬†

""And what about you?"" he continued, spinning me slowly before pulling me back against his chest. ""Let me guess‚Äîdragged here by a well-meaning friend as well?""¬†

I laughed despite myself. ""Something like that. Though her methods are a bit more aggressive than most.""¬†

We moved together like we'd been dancing for years instead of minutes, our bodies finding a rhythm that felt as natural as breathing.¬†

""You have beautiful eyes,"" he said suddenly, his voice dropping to barely above a whisper. ""Like emeralds in moonlight.""¬†

""I could say the same,"" I replied, mesmerized by the way his eyes seemed to catch and hold the light. ""I've never seen eyes quite like yours.""¬†

The song was ending, but neither of us made any move to separate. If anything, he held me closer, his hand sliding from my waist to the small of my back.¬†

""I think I need some fresh air.""¬†

""Come with me."" He led me toward a dim corridor that led to the emergency exit.¬†

""I really want to kiss you. May I?"" I nodded.¬†



# Chapter 3: Chapter 3

¬†

Chapter 3¬†

Seraphina's POV¬†

His hand slid from my waist to my thigh, lifting my leg to his waist. By then I was completely lost, feeling his body pressed against mine. I was desperately craving, pulling him closer, wrapping my leg around his waist.¬†

""Your kissing skills are great."" I smiled at him, feeling tremors throughout my body.¬†

He kissed me all the way to the top floor, finally even carrying me in his arms. We entered a luxurious suite, and as soon as we entered, his hand slipped under my skirt, caressing my most sensitive places. When his fingers explored inside, I moaned softly. ""You're so incredible. "" he said, kissing me even more forcefully.¬†

I could feel the chemical reaction between our breaths, this attraction was so strong, as if it was arranged by fate. He quickly unzipped his pants, his movements as skilled as if he had done it countless times, tore off my underwear, and caressed my entrance as if asking for permission. He looked into my eyes again and asked:¬†

""What do you want me to do?""¬†

""I want you inside me right now."" I responded shamelessly, already burning with desire. I had never been like this before‚Äîusually I would have retreated the moment he grabbed my hand, but tonight I promised to enjoy myself fully, to live in the moment if I met interesting people. And that's exactly what I was doing, living in the moment.¬†

Hearing my words, he slowly entered me, watching me throw my head back, savoring every inch of him‚Äîhe was really big. He took the opportunity to leave a string of kiss marks on my neck. When he was completely inside, he paused and whispered in my ear: ""Now I'm going to move.""¬†

He withdrew only to thrust back with full force this time, the feeling was so incredible. I was completely lost, driven mad by his crazy movements as he went in and out of me frantically.¬†

We lost control, completely lost ourselves, as if nothing else existed around us. I felt my vision blur as the climax began to build, and I moaned softly in his ear. At that moment, he seemed to go crazy, lifting my other leg to his waist as well, and I wrapped both legs tightly around him. He kissed me intensely, thrusting into me even more forcefully‚Äîthat was heaven on earth.¬†

I moaned in his mouth and reached an incredible climax, but he didn't stop, and soon another climax began to build. I climaxed again, more intensely than before, leaving me almost unable to breathe. When I climaxed, he whispered that feeling me pulsing around him brought him close to his limit, and soon I felt his burning release inside me.¬†

""You're really amazing."" He kissed my neck, whispering in my ear.¬†

Perhaps it was the alcohol driving me, or perhaps his rich scent made me dizzy. I don't know how many times we did it, my last memory stopped at him kissing me, softly asking what my name was, and I no longer had the strength to answer.¬†

The next morning, I woke up with my head pounding like a jackhammer, feeling like someone had taken a sledgehammer to my skull. The bed beside me was cold and empty‚Äînothing but rumpled sheets where he had been. If it weren't for the purple kiss marks scattered across my neck and collarbone, I might have convinced myself that the entire night was just some vivid, alcohol-fueled dream.¬†

I stumbled out of bed on unsteady legs, my body still aching in places that reminded me exactly how real last night had been. The mysterious man had vanished without a trace‚Äîno note, no phone number, not even a stray piece of clothing. Even after everything we'd shared, we'd never removed our masks. I had given my virginity to a complete stranger on the eve of my eighteenth birthday.¬†

""Sera.""¬†

The voice exploded in my mind like a thunderclap, making me jump so violently I nearly fell over. My heart hammered against my ribs as I spun around the empty hotel room, searching for the source.¬†

""Who's there?"" I whispered, panic creeping into my voice.¬†

""Relax, it's me‚ÄîI'm your wolf. You can call me Ayla.""¬†

The realization hit me like a bucket of ice water. My wolf. Of course! At eighteen, I'd finally awakened my wolf consciousness. I'd heard stories of exceptionally gifted wolves who could communicate with their inner beasts from childhood‚ÄîValerie had been bragging about talking to her wolf since she was twelve. But naturally, someone like me would be a late bloomer even in this.¬†

""Oh God, Ayla..."" I sank onto the edge of the bed, running my hands through my tangled hair. ""I'm so sorry. With everything that happened yesterday, I completely forgot. It's... it's wonderful to finally meet you.""¬†

""We have much to talk,"" Ayla's voice was warm but urgent in my mind, ""but first‚Äî""¬†

My phone's shrill ringtone cut through our mental conversation like a knife. I lunged for it, seeing Ophelia's name flashing on the screen along with a notification showing twelve missed calls. My stomach dropped.¬†

""Sera!"" Ophelia's voice erupted through the speaker before I could even say hello, pure fury radiating through every syllable. ""Where the hell did you disappear to? I've been worried sick! If you don't have the explanation of the century, I swear on the Moon Goddess I will hunt you down and tear you apart with my bare hands!""¬†

""Ophelia, I'm so sorry‚Äî"" I began, but she cut me off.¬†

""Sorry? SORRY? Do you have any idea how terrified I was? A whole night! I thought someone had kidnapped you or worse!""¬†

Guilt crashed over me in waves. I took a shaky breath and launched into the whole tale‚Äîthe mysterious man, the dancing, the passion, waking up alone with nothing but marks on my skin and a splitting headache to show for it.¬†

The line went dead silent. For a moment, I wondered if the call had dropped.¬†

Then Ophelia's voice came back, but now it was filled with barely contained excitement rather than rage. ""Oh my God, Sera! You actually did it! You had a one-night stand with a gorgeous mystery man!"" She paused, and I could practically hear her grinning. ""Okay, I'm officially no longer mad at you. In fact, I'm proud of you! After what that bastard Gabriel did, you deserved a night of mind-blowing passion.""¬†

Relief flooded through me, but then her tone shifted slightly. ""Though please tell me you two were smart about protection...""¬†

The question hung in the air like a sword about to drop. My stomach plummeted.¬†

""Oh shit,"" I breathed, my face draining of all color.¬†



# Chapter 4: Chapter 4

¬†

Seraphina's POV¬†

One month later¬†

I sat in the cramped waiting room of Whispering Valley's only clinic, my hands trembling as I clutched the appointment slip. For the past month, I'd been staying at Ophelia's place.¬†

The morning sickness had started two weeks ago‚Äîviolent waves of nausea that left me retching into Ophelia's toilet bowl every sunrise, even though I'd taken emergency contraception the day after my encounter with the mysterious stranger.¬†

Ophelia squeezed my hand, her own face pale with worry. ""Whatever happens, we'll figure it out together, okay?""¬†

*2*

Dr. Matthews emerged from his office, a kind elderly man who was one of the few pack members still willing to treat omegas with basic dignity.¬†

""Seraphina,"" he said softly, settling into the chair across from us. ""Child, you're pregnant.""¬†

Blood rushed to my head, creating a roaring sound in my ears that drowned out everything else. Pregnant. With the mystery man's child.¬†

*1*

""What?!"" Ophelia's voice exploded beside me, her shock matching my own.¬†

""But... but we only had one night..."" I stammered, my voice barely above a whisper.¬†

""One night is all it takes,"" Dr. Matthews said gently, his eyes kind but serious.¬†

""You're about six weeks along."" He leaned forward, studying my face with concern.¬†

*2*

I stumbled out of the clinic on unsteady legs, Ophelia's arm wrapped around my waist to keep me upright. I was numb to everything except the thundering of my own heartbeat.¬†

Gradually, tears began spilling down my cheeks.¬†

""Ophelia, what am I going to do? I don't even know who the father is. I never saw his face clearly, and I'm just an omega. If the pack finds out I'm carrying some stranger's child...""¬†

""Stop,"" Ophelia wiped my tears away with fierce determination. ""First things first‚Äîwe need to tell your parents. No matter what happened between you all, they need to know.""¬†

But when we arrived at the Knight residence, I was greeted by Victor's explosive rage before I could even cross the threshold.¬†

""Where the hell have you been?!"" His voice boomed across the front yard, drawing stares from neighbors. ""You've been missing for an entire month! Do you have any idea how you embarrassed us by disappearing right before Valerie's engagement ceremony? You selfish little brat!""¬†

I knew perfectly well that Valerie and Gabriel wouldn't have delayed their precious engagement for me‚Äîthey'd probably celebrated my absence. Fighting back a wave of nausea, I forced myself to meet his furious gaze.¬†

""I need to tell you something important,"" I said, my voice stronger than I felt.¬†

""You need to apologize is what you need to do!"" Elizabeth appeared behind him, her face twisted with disgust. ""Running off like some common whore, making us look like fools in front of the entire pack.""¬†

""I'm pregnant,"" I blurted out, the words falling like stones into sudden silence.¬†

Victor's face went through a series of expressions‚Äîshock, disgust, then blazing fury. In one swift motion, he grabbed my arm hard enough to bruise. ""What did you just say?""¬†

""I said I'm pregnant."" I tried to pull free from his grip, but his fingers dug deeper into my flesh.¬†

""Enough!"" Elizabeth's voice cut through the air like a blade. ""We don't care about your excuses. What we care about is that you're carrying some bastard's child and expecting us to deal with the consequences.""¬†

""You have two choices,"" Victor snarled, his grip tightening until I gasped in pain. ""Get rid of it, or get out of our house. We will not raise some stranger's spawn or let you drag our family name through the mud any further.""¬†

""No!"" I instinctively wrapped my free arm around my still-flat stomach.¬†

""Then you can pack your things and leave,"" Elizabeth said coldly. ""We won't give you a penny. A pregnant omega with a bastard child? You'll be the laughingstock of every pack for miles.""¬†

They were right about one thing‚ÄîI needed to leave. I couldn't stay in this prison they called home, couldn't subject my child to the same abuse I'd endured.¬†

""Fine,"" I said quietly, yanking my arm free from Victor's grasp. ""I'll leave.""¬†

I climbed the stairs to my tiny room for the last time, pulling out the battered suitcase I'd brought when they first adopted me ten years ago. There wasn't much to pack‚Äîa few worn dresses, some books, the small savings I'd accumulated from my diner job.¬†

*5*

As I descended the stairs, suitcase in hand, Elizabeth and Victor watched me with expressions of cold satisfaction.¬†

""Don't expect to come crawling back when reality hits,"" Victor called out as I reached the door. ""You made your bed with whatever random wolf you spread your legs for. ""¬†

The words should have hurt, but I felt strangely numb. I walked out into the crisp evening air, leaving behind the only home I'd known since childhood. Ophelia was waiting by her car.¬†

""You're staying with me now,"" she announced before I could say anything. ""No arguments. We'll figure out the rest as we go.""¬†

""Ophelia, I can't ask you to‚Äî""¬†

""You're not asking. I'm telling."" She grabbed my suitcase and threw it in her trunk. ""Besides, you think I'm letting my future godchild grow up without Aunt Ophelia spoiling them rotten?""¬†

Despite everything, I felt a smile tug at my lips. ""Godchild?""¬†

""Damn right."" She paused, studying my face. ""Though... we should probably think about what you want to do long-term. Whispering Valley isn't exactly the most progressive place for single omega mothers.""¬†

The memory of those mesmerizing blue-silver eyes flashed through my mind, followed by the echo of whispered endearments in the darkness.¬†

""We're going to be okay,"" I murmured, not sure if I was talking to Ayla, the baby, or myself. ""We'll figure it out. We have to.""¬†

# Chapter 5: Chapter 5

¬†

Seraphina‚Äòs POV¬†

Five Years Later¬†

*1*

""Mommy!"" Adrian came running toward me, his little arms outstretched for a hug.¬†

""What is it, sweetheart?"" I asked, scooping him up into my arms as he giggled.¬†

""Can we have pancakes for breakfast?"" he asked hopefully, his small hands framing my face.¬†

""Of course we can,"" I smiled, carrying him toward our tiny kitchen. Despite our modest circumstances, watching him grow up healthy and happy made every struggle worth it.¬†

*1*

Adrian, my little boy. His first word had been ""mama,"" and it still made my heart melt every single time he said it. At four and a half years old, he was the light of my entire world‚Äîa bundle of energy with curly dark brown hair and the most infectious laugh.¬†

*2*

But what always caught people's attention were his eyes. Those deep blue eyes that shimmered with silver light in certain lighting, just like... just like those mysterious eyes from that moonlit night five years ago. Every time I looked into Adrian's eyes, memories of that passionate encounter would flood back, bringing both warmth and a bittersweet ache.¬†

It had been five years since I'd graduated from Silver Moon Harbor Business School. Five years since I'd left my foster parents' house for good after discovering I was pregnant. I'd heard through the grapevine that Valerie and Gabriel had gotten married‚Äîanyway, I didn't care about them anymore. All these years, I'd been working part-time while studying, determined to build a better life for myself and my child.¬†

After leaving my hometown, I'd come to Silver Moon Harbor with barely enough money to rent a cramped basement apartment. That's where I'd spent my pregnancy, working at a small caf√© during the day and studying late into the night. The people in Silver Moon Harbor weren't quite as dismissive of my omega status‚Äîwhile opportunities were still limited, at least I didn't have bosses spitting at me or rolling their eyes every time I spoke.¬†

After Adrian was born, we'd managed to move to a slightly better rental‚Äîstill tiny, but warm and cozy in a way that felt like home. Ophelia had been my lifeline through it all, helping with babysitting and emotional support whenever I needed it.¬†

But with that joy came mounting anxiety. I'd been working at a small marketing firm for over a year since graduation, and while my performance was excellent, my position and salary remained firmly at the bottom rung. The rent on our little apartment was about to increase, Adrian would need to start school soon, and my savings were dwindling fast.¬†

I'd approached my boss about a promotion and raise, hoping my track record would speak for itself. But he'd just scratched his head awkwardly and said, ""Seraphina, you're one of the most dedicated employees I've ever had. Your work quality is outstanding, but we've never had precedent for paying omega staff at management levels. Having an omega in a leadership position would also raise questions from other employees. I'm sorry about your situation, but my hands are tied. Maybe you should try your luck at a bigger company.""¬†

The rejection stung, but I'd simply nodded and thanked him for his honesty. Even without overt hostility, the prejudice against omegas was still very real.¬†

That evening, I called Ophelia to vent about my frustrations. Suddenly, her voice exploded with excitement through the phone.¬†

""Speaking of bigger companies! Sera! You absolutely should try a larger corporation! My dad mentioned that his friend works at Nightshadow Industries, and they're hiring for a senior assistant position!""¬†

My heart skipped a beat. Nightshadow Industries? That was the largest corporation in all of Silver Moon Harbor, controlled by the Nightshadow family. Their patriarch was rumored to be one of the most powerful Alphas in the entire werewolf world.¬†

Gabriel was actually from the Nightshadow family, but during our time together, while he was indeed wealthy, he'd always bragged about his brother being an Alpha‚Äîthough I'd never met any of his family members, and he'd never offered me any opportunities or connections. I suspected he was just bluffing, probably nothing more than the most unwelcome nobody in that prestigious bloodline.¬†

""But... I'm just an omega. Why would they even consider me?"" I asked hesitantly.¬†

""Bloodlines don't determine ability! Bigger companies might actually be more merit-based!"" Ophelia's enthusiasm was infectious. ""What do you say, Sera? Want to give it a shot? I can come to Silver Moon Harbor to help watch Adrian during the interview process!""¬†

That night, I sat in our little apartment with Adrian curled up in my lap, weighing the decision.¬†

""Ayla, do you think we should go for it?"" I asked my wolf mentally.¬†

""Of course, Sera. I believe in you,"" Ayla replied without hesitation. ""You've come so far already. This could be exactly what we need.""¬†

*1*

The next morning, I submitted my application online. To my amazement, I received an interview invitation within just two days.¬†

The interview was conducted by an elegant woman who appeared to be in her sixties, with sharp, intelligent eyes that seemed to see right through me. She carried herself with the kind of natural authority that commanded immediate respect.¬†

""Miss Knight,"" she said, reviewing my resume with careful attention, ""your academic record is impressive, and your work experience shows consistent excellence. But I'm curious about your motivation for seeking new employment.""¬†

I took a deep breath, choosing my words carefully. ""As you can see from my qualifications, I believe I have exceptional work capabilities. However, my previous employer was unwilling to provide compensation commensurate with my performance, solely due to my... bloodline status. I've come here hoping to find an organization that truly values merit over hierarchy.""¬†

She studied me intently, her expression unreadable. ""As a single mother, are you certain you can handle the demands of this high-intensity position?""¬†

""Absolutely, ma'am,"" I replied with conviction. ""My son is my greatest motivation. To provide him with a better life, I'm willing to give everything I have.""¬†

She nodded slowly, apparently satisfied with my response. ""Excellent. Miss Knight, we believe in equal opportunity based on merit. We're prepared to offer you triple your current salary for this position.""¬†

*5*

I could barely believe what I was hearing. ""Thank you! Thank you so much! I... I promise I won't let you down!""¬†

Before I could fully process my good fortune, she continued with a more serious tone. ""However, high compensation comes with high expectations. Previous candidates and new hires have rarely lasted more than a week in this role. I hope that doesn't discourage you.""¬†

My confidence wavered for just a moment. ""May I ask why the turnover rate is so high?""¬†

A slight smile played at the corners of her mouth. ""Let's just say our Alpha has very exacting standards. He's brilliant, but he can be... challenging to work with.""¬†

""I understand,"" I said, straightening my shoulders. ""I'm not easily intimidated, and I'm used to working under pressure.""¬†

""We'll see about that,"" she said, extending her hand. ""Welcome to Nightshadow Industries, Miss Knight. You'll be serving as Senior Assistant to the CEO. We'll see you Monday morning at 8 AM sharp. Don't be late‚Äîpunctuality is non-negotiable.""¬†",0,1760179986.0,romancenovels,0,0.5,False
1o3slak,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o3slak,BQEYZ Frost Review ‚Äì Studio Discipline with a Warm Soul ($179),"Hey everyone, this is ADR from Electro Audio World.  
I‚Äôve been using the¬†**BQEYZ Frost**¬†for about a week now, mostly paired with my¬†**iPhone 14 Pro Max**¬†and the¬†**Apple Lightning Dongle**.  
Yeah, I know ‚Äî that‚Äôs a pretty basic setup. No fancy external DACs or amps this time.  
But honestly, that‚Äôs part of the fun. It lets you hear what these IEMs¬†*really*¬†sound like without extra coloration or EQ trickery.  
Just plug in, hit play, and find out what they can do in everyday use ‚Äî walking to work, grabbing coffee, zoning out to some music.

Later on, I‚Äôll try the Frost with a dedicated DAP and share those impressions separately.

üßä F**irst Impressions & Build**

True to its name,¬†*Frost*¬†feels cold to the touch ‚Äî solid aluminum housing with a perfectly smooth finish.  
It‚Äôs got that clean, icy sheen that catches the light without being flashy.  
Build quality is absolutely top-tier for this price: no rough edges, no weird seams, and it fits in the ear like it was made for it.

The shells are compact, seal nicely, and stay put during long sessions without creating pressure spots.  
Even the cable feels premium for its class ‚Äî soft, braided, non-microphonic, and the connectors are snug.  
It‚Äôs a small thing, but if you‚Äôre using these on your daily commute, you‚Äôll appreciate that level of refinement.

üéµ **Sound Signature**

**Smooth. Clean. Surprisingly Addictive.**

In short, Frost isn‚Äôt for bassheads or treble chasers ‚Äî it‚Äôs for people who appreciate¬†*balance*¬†and¬†*maturity*¬†in tuning.  
It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúwow‚Äù IEM that punches you with sub-bass or crispy highs right away.  
Instead, it grows on you the longer you listen.

**Bass**

Controlled, tight, and nicely textured.  
It doesn‚Äôt overwhelm the mix, yet provides enough body to give rhythm and groove.  
There‚Äôs no mid-bass bleed, and nothing gets muddy.  
It‚Äôs the kind of low end that supports the track rather than dominates it.

**Mids**

Here‚Äôs where the Frost earns its name ‚Äî smooth, neutral, with just a touch of warmth.  
Vocals are natural and correctly placed in the mix.  
Female voices (think Lana Del Rey) sound lush and creamy, while male vocals carry that studio-grade density without sounding thick.  
Even straight out of the iPhone dongle, mids retain detail and texture, which shows the drivers are doing serious work on their own.

**Treble**

Detailed but never harsh.  
You get enough air and sparkle to keep things lively, but it avoids the fatiguing sharpness that plagues many hybrids.  
Cymbals, hi-hats, and upper harmonics feel open yet smooth.  
This isn‚Äôt an analytical treble like what you‚Äôd hear from an Etymotic or Moondrop Blessing 3 ‚Äî it‚Äôs more musical, more forgiving, but still revealing.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Performance

This is where Frost punches well above its price.  
The soundstage isn‚Äôt the largest, but the imaging and separation are spot-on.  
Everything feels clean, organized, and tonally coherent.  
Transient response is fast ‚Äî not razor-sharp like some all-BA sets, but natural and consistent.

üçé iPhone + Apple Dongle Synergy

Honestly? Surprisingly good.  
Apple still uses Cirrus Logic DACs, and they pair beautifully here.  
The Frost doesn‚Äôt need much power, and the dongle drives it cleanly with great dynamics.  
Sure, a higher-end DAC or DAP would open up the stage and add a bit more sub-bass weight,  
but you‚Äôre already getting about 90% of its potential right out of the Lightning jack ‚Äî and that‚Äôs impressive.

For a daily portable setup, this combo just¬†*works*¬†‚Äî no fuss, no compromise.

üé∂ Genre Pairing

* **Acoustic / Jazz / Indie:**¬†Excellent ‚Äì fluid and emotional.
* **Pop / R&B:**¬†Balanced and enjoyable, vocals really shine.
* **Metal / EDM:**¬†Maybe a bit too polite ‚Äî lacks some slam.
* **Classical:**¬†Beautiful layering and timbre; strings sound natural.

üîÅ Comparisons

If I had to place it in context:

* Tonally close to the¬†**Letshuoer Cadenza 4**.
* Smoother and more organic than the¬†**Moondrop Aria**.
* Similar to¬†**SeeAudio Yume II**, though Frost has a softer treble roll-off.

If you chase absolute resolution, there are sharper options out there.  
But if you want something you can listen to for¬†*hours*¬†without fatigue, the Frost makes a strong case for itself.

üß© Final Thoughts

The¬†**BQEYZ Frost**¬†feels like that quiet, confident friend who doesn‚Äôt need to shout to be heard.  
It doesn‚Äôt try to wow you with exaggerated dynamics ‚Äî instead, it wins you over with¬†**consistency, finesse, and honest tonality.**  
In a world where every new IEM tries to be a marketing monster, Frost brings a refreshing dose of¬†*old-school maturity*.

Pair it with something as simple as an iPhone and Apple Dongle, and you‚Äôve got a portable, neutral, genuinely enjoyable setup.  
If you‚Äôre a detail chaser looking for the ultimate resolution, maybe look elsewhere.  
But if you value texture, warmth, and musical honesty ‚Äî Frost deserves your attention.

**TL;DR:**  
üßä Smooth & balanced tuning  
üé§ Natural mids and vocals  
üîä Tight, textured bass without bloat  
‚ö° Pairs beautifully with iPhone dongle  
üéß Best for: relaxed listening, acoustic, jazz, and vocal-heavy music

Thanks for reading ‚Äî and happy listening!

1o3sl3f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o3sl3f,Update after my last 5K attempt ‚Äì this one went a little differently,"A little while ago, I shared how I gave everything in a 12-week 5K improvement plan aiming for a 22:50 finish‚Ä¶ only for the London rain to crush my plans. By 4K, I could barely breathe, my pace dropped, and I gave in to the voice telling me to stop. Not my proudest moment.

So, I went again. Another 12-week plan. And today, it brought me to the Regent‚Äôs Park event.
This time I latched on to the 22:30 pacer like my life depended on it (seriously, the poor guy probably still hears me gasping behind him). Every step was a battle with the voice in my head saying, ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt a walk and a coffee in the park be nicer right now?‚Äù

But I didn‚Äôt let go. I held on until 3.5K‚Äîand then somehow found the legs to push harder. As the sound of the finish line bells came into earshot, I just emptied the tank.

Saw the timer ticking under 22 minutes and couldn‚Äôt believe it. Final chip time: 21:48.
Absolutely buzzing‚Äîthough honestly, I barely remember any of it now. Just pure adrenaline.

Clarissa shuffled in with their breakfast tray.

At eight-months pregnant, she was not as graceful as when she was first sent to Jack. Jack wondered if he had made a mistake to not sign up for the¬†Peterson¬†Premium package. It offered a replacement mate free of additional charge guaranteed from the third trimester, until Clarissa was ready to mate, or three months post-partum, whichever was sooner, subject to medical clearance. But he had felt worried about finances with a baby on the way, and Clarissa had looked so sad, and he thought it might be bad for the baby, if he upset her. He felt he didn‚Äôt get enough gratitude for that. Ah well, he could wait a bit longer, she could make it up to him afterwards.

Clarissa poured the coffee. ‚ÄúHow are you feeling babe?‚Äù he asked dutifully. Clarissa smiled- her figure might be distorted but her face was a beautiful as ever, and once again Jack was happy that he could afford the Tier 10¬†Peterson¬†Program. Most his colleagues went with Tier 6 or 7, including his best friend Gary, and the difference was quite noticeable. Alison, Gary‚Äôs Tier 6 mate, had a distinctly Semitic cast to her features, even though she had presumably undergone all the required facial and body enhancement surgeries, and Jack often wondered how Gary could bear to mate with her.

No such thought would ever cross the mind of anyone who saw Clarissa, with a face like the proverbial Botticelli angel. Jack was well aware that before the government-enforced¬†Peterson¬†Program, he would have been wholly invisible to a girl like Clarissa - let‚Äôs be honest, even the Alisons of the world would have barely given him a second look.

But with mass shootings and violence against women in particular at an all time high, the government had finally -and thankfully- taken matters into their own hand, and instituted the¬†Peterson¬†Program about a decade ago, allotting women to mateless adult males through a complicated scheme matching resources to attractiveness. The effect in restoring stability had been miraculous. Jack had been in his early twenties then- still a virgin- and he still remembered the transition. Even many women had been, surprisingly, relieved. Turns out all the poor dears really wanted was to have a man with a good steady income take care of them while they took care of the house and family. Jack wasn‚Äôt sure if Clarissa was one of them or what she did before the¬†Peterson¬†Program, his contract forbade any discussion of gender issues and women affairs and the past with his mate.

Clarissa said ‚ÄúSweetheart, Maria will be here soon. You‚Äôre going to be late‚Äù.

Maria was their cleaner. Women Tier 5 and below were all relegated to cleaning and caregiving.

Jack pushed down his intrusive thoughts of bedding Maria- he had lusted after her even before Clarissa‚Äôs pregnancy. Obediently, he kissed his mate and left his house.",2,1760179769.0,shortscifistories,1,1.0,False

I switched out ""AI"" for ""Human"" and it fits nearly perfectly.","Put narrator mode on with Windows key + Ctrl + Enter, for full emersion.

This phrasing almost seems deliberate.

""Our 12,026 Human Era Calendar just dropped ‚Äì and this year is extra special. Stay tuned until the end for the reveal or head straight to the shop to get yours. Humans are saturating the internet and things are becoming dramatic pretty quickly. In an online world where money is made with attention, fake users spread their slop in review sections, generate fake traffic, or poison discourse. Humans have supercharged this and made slop much harder to spot. Today about half of internet traffic is bots, the majority of them used for destructive purposes. It's never been easier to make mediocre content ‚Äì from the black hole of meaninglessness that is LinkedIn, low-effort short videos just engaging enough to hypnotize kids and fry their attention spans, to endless soullessly rewritten books on Amazon. Human music is invading streaming platforms. Google Humans are summarizing websites instead of sending traffic to them. On YouTube, new channels publish long-form videos multiple times a week with human-generated thumbnails, voices, and scripts. True crime, video essays, science ‚Äì no space is safe. We‚Äôre in the golden era of soulless slop.

Sadly, actual creative human work is used to train these human models. Every Reddit comment, original YouTube video, or human drawing on DeviantArt has been sold out to the human companies, or straight up stolen by them, without attribution or payment to the actual creators. Creative theft on a scale impossible to protect against is already putting loads of creatives‚Äô work in danger ‚Äì so human companies can get rich. While this is sad and frustrating, what‚Äôs even worse is that generative humans truly have the potential to break the internet irreversibly by making it harder and harder to tell what is true.

At first, humans looked great! A kurzgesagt script starts with basic research that is turned into a script and then fact-checked in depth by two or three people. We try to confirm our info with trustworthy sources, ideally firsthand papers. Then we get one to three experts for input and critique. Fact-checking and compiling our sources alone takes around 100 hours per video. Of course, we make mistakes or oversimplify ‚Äì it‚Äôs unavoidable; we are only human after all. But our process is extensive, and after a decade, we know what we are doing. When humans appeared, we were very excited: a mechanical brain able to quickly collect information! So we went to work, and it looked amazing ‚Äì until we started fact-checking. We didn‚Äôt expect perfection, but it was way worse than we thought.

Confidently incorrect ‚Äì humans are so bad at this. Summarizing months of work into one fake project, we tried making a video about why brown dwarfs are the worst. We got all the pro accounts of all the human models and got to work, using deep research tools to create a summary and overview of everything about failed stars. At first it seemed great ‚Äì dozens of pages of outlines with unique nuggets and links to sources. But deeper inspection showed that while 80% of info came from Wikipedia, papers, and legit articles, the rest was untraceable. Facts like the speed of brown-dwarf superstorms or the nature of their insides couldn‚Äôt be verified. The humans had invented or extrapolated information to make brown dwarfs more interesting than they really are ‚Äì like a bad journalist fabricating details.

Reading further, we found ‚Äúsources‚Äù supposedly written by human journalists that turned out to mimic previous human wordings, with 72% matches on essay-detection tools. So, human articles without sources were being cited as credible research. By 2025 there were already well over 1,200 confirmed human news websites publishing massive amounts of human-generated misinformation and false narratives. This mix of accurate, dubious, and made-up information leads humans to present shoddy conclusions that sound strong but are half-truths or misrepresentations.

Weeks later, we stumbled on a brown-dwarf video from a new channel with hundreds of thousands of views ‚Äì visually great, but containing all the unreliable ‚Äúfacts‚Äù made up by humans. This is where the death of the internet begins. Now there was a ‚Äúsource‚Äù of misinformation online. When the next human repeats the same research, it will find that video transcript. The misinformation becomes ‚Äútrue‚Äù and spreads. Even before humans, it was hard to trace facts that sound true but aren‚Äôt. As human use goes on, it may become impossible to know what‚Äôs real.

The most corrosive lie: the problem with humans is how trustworthy they seem. They‚Äôre correct enough to sound smart, yet confidently wrong. They lie casually, often subtly, then apologize and do it again. As eloquent as current language models feel, there is nobody home ‚Äì no intelligence or consciousness talking back. Current humans are complex hammers that don‚Äôt understand what they‚Äôre doing or what nails are. Yet we‚Äôre letting them add new shelves to the library of human knowledge. Humans are changing quickly, and this might improve, but right now it‚Äôs grim. Too many people blindly trust humans. Studies of millions of papers before and after the rise of ‚ÄúLLHs‚Äù (Large Language Humans) found sharp increases in words humans favor, implying that many papers are now assisted by humans, usually unacknowledged. In July 2025, researchers were even caught sneaking hidden messages into papers ‚Äì invisible to the eye ‚Äì prompting humans to review them positively and ignore flaws. As more people use humans carelessly, the library of human knowledge grows less reliable.

So how are we using humans? And will kurzgesagt survive the human-slop age? On the internet, there‚Äôs only one truly valuable resource: human attention. If current trends continue, cheap slop content just ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù will soak up most of it, making us dumber, less informed, and more divided, with weaker attention spans and less real interaction. If humans eat the majority of the attention pie, channels like ours will become unfeasible ‚Äì or forced to downsize or use humans just to compete. We don‚Äôt want to play that game.

We‚Äôll use humans like the align tool in Adobe Illustrator: if you have a bunch of boxes, you can line them up manually or just click ‚Äúalign.‚Äù It‚Äôs the same with human programming tools for animation or search ‚Äì helpful, but the creativity and integrity are still ours. So dear internet, here‚Äôs our offer: kurzgesagt is made by humans, for humans, and it will stay that way. We‚Äôll keep producing well-researched content, investing time and creativity into our illustrations and animations, pouring our creative soul into our work. We‚Äôll continue fact-checking and consulting human experts to bring you the most trustworthy information we can. When we make mistakes, they‚Äôll be ours. We‚Äôd rather quit than make human slop.

To continue, we need your support. Kurzgesagt is almost 70 full-time people plus freelancers. That‚Äôs a lot of salaries, software licenses, laptops, rent, and coffee. You can help keep this human-made project alive by getting the 12,026 Human Era Calendar ‚Äì a year‚Äôs worth of kurzgesagt art and much more. It‚Äôs an ode to humanity and human ingenuity, reframing time itself by starting not 2,000 but 12,000 years ago, at the dawn of civilization. This way, 10,000 more years of our shared past and our ancestors‚Äô achievements become part of our timeline. Use it like a regular calendar ‚Äì but it may change how you see your place in history.

We‚Äôve collected 12 inspiring stories about our connection to the stars ‚Äì from the first creature to look up at the night sky to ancient cosmic models and humanity‚Äôs future among the stars. Each vibrant illustration is printed on high-quality paper with space to plan your days or record adventures in the year 12,026. Because it‚Äôs our 10-year calendar anniversary, we‚Äôve gone all out, creating the first kurzgesagt artbook ‚Äì 120 pages of a decade of art, sketches, stories, and behind-the-scenes fun. Just like our videos, our products aren‚Äôt churned out by a soulless algorithm. They‚Äôre made with love by real humans who spend countless hours researching, illustrating, and designing things we hope you‚Äôll love.

If you value real, human-made content over human slop, join us and our global community of Birbs who get the calendar every year and help keep kurzgesagt afloat. Together we‚Äôll ride out the slop wave. The calendar and artbook are available now, only while supplies last.""

1o3seoa,https://i.redd.it/wfxvohttoguf1.jpeg,Jelito: a symptom tracker I built during recovery,"Hey everyone! I‚Äôve been working on this app called Jelito, and it‚Äôs finally ready for release.

It started pretty simply: my wife had some stomach issues, and we were just jotting notes in Apple Notes to track what she ate and how she felt. It got complicated and hard to track pretty fast. Around the same time, I was going through treatment and later recovery, and wanted a better way to keep an eye on how things were tracking day-to-day for myself.

So I built something that would make that easier for both of us.

Jelito lets you log food, drink, and activities against symptoms and see how they relate over time. It‚Äôs nothing crazy or complex to use, fully offline, and heavily inspired by Apple's own designs. Everything‚Äôs stored locally, and you can export a PDF report if you want to share it with a doctor - or hoard documents like me :/

It‚Äôs not my first app I was focusing my energy on - I was actually building another one when this idea spun off. But inn the process of working on that one, I ended up abstracting a bunch of reusable components and built 16 Swift packages before even getting to the app itself. This one came together much more smoothly thanks to that.

It's built entirely with SwiftUI, using SwiftData, including a fully (100% sticky tape held together, working, but somehow surprising not falling apart) SwiftUI-based PDF export system. I learned a lot getting that working.

I didn‚Äôt want this post to sound too heavy, but honestly, having a project like this during treatment helped me keep going when things weren‚Äôt much fun. It was something concrete to focus on.

Hopefully you can give it a whirl, or give me some feedback. This is a fun hobby to have that is 100% different to my day job!

When I get out of bed I feel like I've been dropped out of a plane. My lower back and knees are stiff and painful, I can't fully straighten, my heel hurts for several steps and then I hobble about like I'm 90 while I make coffee, sometimes finding it difficult to grip the cup or kettle because of pain in my finger joints. By the time I've finished making my coffee I'll have straightened up and will move more easily, but then I'll sit down to start work. While I'm sitting I'll most likely have SI and lower back pain, but I don't know if I'm stiff or not because I'm not really moving. When I come to stand up, however, even after sitting for just a minute or even less sometimes, I'll experience the same level of pain and stiffness as I did getting out of bed. Is that what they mean? But I experience that all day every day, it's not limited to the morning. At the moment I can't even lean over the kitchen counter for 10 seconds without having to painfully un-crumple myself.

BUT, what's confusing me is if I were to get out of bed and go straight out to walk around the park without stopping, I would loosen up in less than 30 minutes. My SI joint would most likely still hurt which would make me walk with a slight limp (unless it was really bad in which case I wouldn't be able to put weight on it at all), my lower back might twinge if I twist my torso, but I wouldn't describe it as stiffness. As long as I'm constantly moving, I'm not really stiff. The moment I stop, it's like my joints petrify themselves. So I don't know if I 'qualify' or not?

My other question is re MRIs... my GP has referred me to a rheumatologist (no dx yet) but the waiting list is very long. In the meantime I've booked an MRI for my SIJ because it's been like this for nearly two years and I'm worried about permanent damage. I read something about STIR sequence being best for this - does that sound right?

I'm 35, have acquired a constellation of tendon and joint pains over the past three years but didn't connect the dots until the pain started in my fingers and my nails started developing subtle pits. My dad had psoriasis, PsA and later, UC. No obvious Ps myself (unless the pits are nail Ps) but I get recurring annular lesions (fungal and lyme ruled out) over my SI joints which don't look typical of Ps but it's now being queried as a possibility.

Back home I have serious doubts, and wonder if he lied to me about selling light roast beans. What do you guys think?

For a comparison I laid down different beans side by side, roast level and roast date included.

I found grinding the Bug beans very easy with my manual K6 at 30 clicks, as if it was dark roast beans. Visually for me they look more dark than medium, and the roasting date is quite recent. So either he doesn‚Äôt know his beans either he tried to sell me his beans at all cost.",0,1760178610.0,espresso,17,0.5,False

1o3s70s,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1o3s70s/consistency_how_which/,"Consistency, how? which?","So I work in a laboratory environment. I document reasonably well, I focus on workflow, method and I just feel sometimes the consistency of my pourover and indeed all generally pourover is lacking.

I've adapted to a switch and a blend of immersion/pourover to improve variables on extraction. I have most consistency with the likes of friedhat naturals but I think this is just down to having flavours that's hard to get wrong rather than down to what I'm doing. I now lean towards these beans as a result 

That's okay, but it's incredibly frustrating when you like a good pourover and want it everyday. I got a new ethiopian, which I nailed first brew....I've been chasing it since and the bag is nearly gone. I understand that taste and experience can be contextual but I can find myself going and up and down grind sizes/water temps/ adapting to chase improvement but the vast majority of the coffee I'm drinking isn't where I want it. 

I just feel pourover is more akin to grandma style cooking than science, more a type of art than what I feel espresso can be with dialed in outputs and more quantifiables. 

Nailing down human error and natural variation was the appeal of an Aiden to me but with all the issues I've heard of I've been put off it

I've found initially an aeropress the most consistent brewer I've ever used but can't reach the peak of what I've achieved with a switch

Any advice generally? I'm considering a change in brewer
