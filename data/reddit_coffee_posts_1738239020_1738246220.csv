The problem is my health has taken a bit of a dip since then and I really don’t have the energy nor the pain levels to be able to stand around cooking and prepping each day, so I’ve found myself eating the same easy prep/grab and go stuff each day. I’m full enough and not at all bored of what I’m eating but I’m worried that it’s not right or I’m missing vital stuff. For example, this week it’s been:

45g ranola - 198cal  
10g honey - 32cal  
coffee - 85cal

frube yogurt - 33cal  
cheese - 61cal  
chocolate - 101cal  

Dinner:  
quiche - 255cal (other times it’s chicken, or boiled egg)  
dip - 121cal
salad - admittedly I don’t weigh this each time - i tend to just eyeball it, but on average it’s around 90 cal between cucumber, lettuce, celery, tomato and carrot

Snack:  
Usually fruit, a belvita bar or mini pastry thing - 161 - 188cal depending on what I grab

I also drink a minimum of 2L water a day and take a multivitamin too.

### Devotional: Grace-Filled Minds – Nurturing Mental Health Through Faith and Community

**Scripture Focus:**  
“Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind…” — Romans 12:2 (ESV)

- - - - - -

**Reflection:**

In a world that often feels chaotic and overwhelming, the need for mental health and emotional well-being has come to the forefront of our conversations. As believers, we are called to care for not just our spirits, but also our minds and bodies. The beauty of our faith is that it offers us profound resources through which we can nurture our mental health, primarily through God’s grace and the support of our community.

**Grace as a Foundation:**

Grace is not merely an abstract concept; it is God’s unmerited favor extended towards us, regardless of our circumstances. In moments of doubt, depression, or anxiety, we can find solace in the assurance that we are loved and accepted just as we are. This grace allows us to come before God with our vulnerabilities, empowering us to process our emotions without judgment.

When we embrace God’s grace, we cultivate a mental space that allows healing. As we let go of guilt or shame about our mental struggles, we create room for grace to ignite transformation. Remember, mental health is not a sign of weak faith; rather, it is a human experience that God sees and cares about deeply.

**Community Support:**

In addition to individual faith practices, our mental health flourishes within the community of believers. The church—an embodiment of the body of Christ—is where we find support, understanding, and fellowship. Connecting with others who share our faith nurtures our minds and hearts.

As stated in Hebrews 10:24-25, “And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another…” Our communities remind us that we are not alone in our struggles. They offer prayers, encouragement, and sometimes the simple act of listening, helping us feel valued and understood.

**Action Steps:**

1. **Embrace Prayer and Scripture:** Dedicate time each day to pray and meditate on passages that speak to your mental well-being. Consider starting with Psalm 34:18, which reassures us that the Lord is close to the brokenhearted.
2. **Form Connections:** Reach out to a trusted friend or member of your church community. Schedule a coffee date, join a small group, or participate in community events. Sharing your journey opens the door to healing and encourages others to do the same.
3. **Practice Self-Care:** Recognize that care for your mind, body, and spirit is a form of worship. Engage in practices that promote health, whether that’s exercise, journaling, or seeking professional help.
4. **Serve Others:** Sometimes, the act of serving can heal our hearts. Volunteer within your community, offering support to others in need. Acts of kindness often generate a sense of purpose that can rejuvenate our spirits.

**Prayer:**

Heavenly Father, thank You for Your grace that frees us from our burdens and gives us courage during our times of struggle. Help us to embrace our mental health journey as one that is woven with faith and supported by loving community. Guide us as we lift each other up and reflect Your love in our interactions. May we be open vessels of grace, allowing Your light to shine through us even in our trials. In Jesus’ name, we pray. Amen.

- - - - - -

**Conclusion:**

As we journey through life, let us remain committed to nurturing our minds with the grace and support offered through our faith and community. Share your struggles, celebrate your victories, and remember that you are a vital part of the body of Christ, cherished and valuable. Embrace each day with hope and grace-filled purpose, trusting that God is nurturing your mind alongside your spirit.

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1idnlne,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1idnlne/navigating_partnerships_in_business/,Navigating Partnerships in Business,"Navigating the wild world of business partnerships can sometimes feel like trying to herd cats—chaotic, unpredictable, and you’re bound to get scratched along the way. Before diving headfirst into the pool of entrepreneurship with someone else, here are some keys to unlocking that proverbial treasure chest of success while keeping the drama at bay.

**1. Shared Vision and Values:** Simply put, make sure you’re on the same page (or at least in the same book). Otherwise, one partner might be writing a romance while the other is crafting a horror story. Have open discussions about your goals, values, and what success looks like for both of you. If one of you seeks world domination while the other just wants a comfy office and a decent work-life balance, consider that a red flag.

**2. Clear Roles and Responsibilities:** Define who does what. It’s like assigning seats for a long road trip—everyone needs to know who’s in charge of the snacks and who controls the playlist. When roles are clearly laid out from the start, it minimizes overlapping responsibilities and the chance that someone could end up feeling like they’re pulling all the weight. Spoiler alert: Resentment is a trust killer.

**3. Communication is Key:** Establish a norm for how you’ll communicate. Regular check-ins, whether they’re in the form of coffee chats or weekly meetings, can help keep the lines of communication open. And let’s be real—no one wants to be blindsided by surprises. Checking in on progress and sharing feedback not only addresses potential issues early but also keeps the partnership strong, kind of like a well-oiled machine.

**4. Set Expectations—And Write Them Down!** Treat this like setting up a constitution for your partnership. What do you expect from each other in terms of performance, work ethic, and effort? Put these agreements in writing; this gives you a roadmap to refer back to, especially during those inevitable bumps in the road. And trust me, the road can get bumpy.

**5. Embrace Conflict, Don’t Avoid It:** Spoiler alert: conflicts will happen, and that’s okay. Approach conflicts with the mindset of a puzzle enthusiast—let’s figure this out together! Acknowledge that disagreements can lead to growth and creative problem-solving. Just remember to keep the tone civil and focus on the issue, not personal jabs. Nobody wants a business partnership that feels like a reality TV showdown.

**6. Have a Conflict Resolution Plan:** Just in case things get a bit heated (after all, sometimes you need a cool-down after those friendly disagreements), establish how you’ll handle conflicts when they arise. This could involve seeking outside counsel, mediation, or simply agreeing to take a step back when tempers flare. Think of it as your “emergency break glass” plan.

**7. Celebrate Wins Together:** Finally, don’t forget to pop the champagne (or your beverage of choice) when you hit those milestones. Celebrate your achievements, big or small; it reinforces the partnership and reminds both of you why you teamed up in the first place. Nothing builds a sense of community quite like acknowledging shared victories.

Businesses thrive on strong relationships just like communities do, and at the heart of it all is trust, open communication, and a sprinkle of humor to keep things light. So gear up for an adventure together, knowing that as long as you're both in it for the right reasons, you can tackle just about anything that comes your way.",1,1738245673.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

1idniua,https://i.redd.it/g9ygdjq605ge1.jpeg,Homework with NO help!,"Backstory:

My now 16-year-old son has been mostly homeschooled since second grade, except for a little bit of seventh and ninth (but that didn’t work out so well). This year, he chose to try regular school again for tenth grade.

The first semester was a nightmare, leading to major aggression like I’d never seen before. It resulted in a week-long stay at a facility (his first time away from me 🥺), multiple nightly hospital visits by police car, medication changes, and more. I know it sounds like I should’ve pulled him back out but he wanted to push through.

This meant adjusting to multiple classes (some honors, which tend to expect more!), different teacher personalities (one of whom is not great and shouldn't even be a teacher 😡), and navigating a lot of new people around him—some of whom were bullies. We cracked down on that immediately, though one kid took some time... but mama handled it. 🤪

On top of all that, he faced a total schedule change, loads of classwork and homework, and, of course, a sad amount of masking. I had to fight pretty hard with his 504 team to make sure he got the accommodations he needed—not just for ADHD, but for Autism as well. This was especially important in English and his Peer Connections class, where he struggled with assignments that required writing about personal feelings or hypothetical situations—usually situations most of us rarely even experience ourselves.

Now for the whole reason of the post! 

Peer Connections assignments are usually time-consuming Google Slides projects about internal emotions or “about me” topics. These often triggered major meltdowns because they felt overwhelming, like they would take forever, or simply because he didn’t connect with the subject matter. Sometimes, I could help by getting him to find pictures while I guided him through the topics and put everything together.

But last night…magic happened.

He sat at his desk, got out his computer, and said, “OK, I’ve got this. I just need a cup of coffee.” (He just turned 16 and now feels manly drinking coffee. Lol.) So, I made him some, and he went to work!

The assignment was about healthy vs. unhealthy relationships—but he added his own twist: ""Healthy vs. Unhealthy Relationships for Drones."" Lol. It was inspired by the Murder Drones series, but hey, whatever works!

With his headphones on, he repeated everything he was doing out loud—probably at least three times—and sounded so mad at it but he did it! He even Googled how to do things he didn’t know, like changing the font, adding background colors, and inserting borders—all without asking me for help or doing it for him. I just sat nearby and listened:

""FONT! FONT! FONT!... ADD BORDER! ADD BORDER! ADD BORDER! OMG, ALIGN ALIGN ALIIIIIGN....THERE.""

He did the whole thing on his own! He got a little OCD about making the borders perfect, but hey, nothing wrong with that.

When he printed it out and saw his work, his face lit up! I asked him how he felt about what he had accomplished, and he said, “REALLY GOOD!” I told him it looked fantastic and that he should be proud of himself, and he said, “Yeah!”

So, that’s my proud mama moment. Sorry it was a bit long, but this is the only place I can really share where other parents get it!

I even emailed his teacher to let her know he did it completely alone, with no help! She’s a fantastic teacher, and I know she’ll be so proud of him.

I attached the image. I'm hoping that's allowed. He used Murder Drones images for his slides in case people don't know what it is and it looks scary. 🤣

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Georgia has become a popular spot for digital nomads looking for a blend of culture, natural beauty, and modern conveniences. With its rich history and welcoming communities, you can find the perfect environment to focus and create. One key factor influencing this trend is the availability of coworking spaces that cater to the needs of remote workers.

When considering a location to settle in for your remote work journey, Wi-Fi reliability is a must. Fortunately, Georgia's coworking spaces are equipped with fast and consistent internet, allowing you to stay connected no matter where you are. This guide will introduce you to some of the best coworking spaces in Georgia, highlighting their features that make them ideal for digital nomads.

Here are some popular coworking spaces in the state:

- **Impact Hub Tbilisi**
Located in the heart of Tbilisi, this coworking space fosters collaboration among entrepreneurs, freelancers, and innovators. With high-speed Wi-Fi and cozy workstations, you can set your creativity free. Regular events and workshops further enhance your networking opportunities.

- **Settings Tbilisi**
Offering an inspiring atmosphere and plenty of natural light, Settings Tbilisi provides comfortable desks and meeting rooms. It also boasts reliable Wi-Fi, making it a favorite among those who prioritize productivity. The community feel encourages connections, perfect for digital nomads.

Choosing the right coworking space involves considering factors beyond just the amenities. Make sure to think about the community, events, and vibe. Here’s a quick list of factors to consider:

​ -Plan Your Visit to Georgia Here--&gt;https://travels-101.com/explore-everything-georgia-has-to-offer  
- **Location:** Choose a space that's conveniently located near accommodations, restaurants, and transportation.
- **Community:** Look for a place that hosts networking events, allowing you to meet fellow digital nomads and expand your connections.
- **Membership Plans:** Consider options that offer flexibility in plans, whether it’s daily passes or monthly memberships.
- **Amenities:** Check if they provide free coffee, snacks, printers, or private meeting rooms.
- **Work Environment:** Visit the space if possible to see if the atmosphere suits your work style.

In addition to coworking spaces, Georgia’s digital nomad scene thrives due to the affordability of living. Compared to many Western countries, the cost of living in Georgia, especially Tbilisi and Batumi, is quite low. This allows you to enjoy a balanced life filled with cultural experiences, culinary delights, and stunning landscapes, all while staying productive.

Moreover, Georgia’s fast internet accessibility across cities and rural areas makes it a compelling choice for remote work. This ensures that even if you decide to work from a cozy café or a scenic mountain lodge, you can still stay connected with clients and colleagues worldwide.

Georgia’s coworking spaces are thoughtfully designed to cater to the needs of digital nomads. With reliable Wi-Fi and enriching communities, you’ll be well-equipped to balance work and adventure. As you explore the vibrant culture and stunning landscapes, you can enjoy the freedom of remote work from one of the most captivating countries in the world.

Evaluating Wi-Fi Reliability in Georgia: A Crucial Factor for Digital Nomads
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For digital nomads, reliable Wi-Fi isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s essential. While working remotely offers an exciting lifestyle, the need for consistent internet connectivity cannot be overstated. Georgia, with its unique blend of culture, affordability, and natural beauty, has become a hot spot for many digital nomads. Evaluating Wi-Fi reliability in this lush region is vital for those looking to make it their temporary home.

​ -Plan Your Visit to Georgia Here--&gt;https://travels-101.com/explore-everything-georgia-has-to-offer  
When choosing a location in Georgia, consider these key aspects:

- **Availability:** Many urban areas, particularly Tbilisi—the capital—boast strong Wi-Fi networks. However, rural regions may experience limited coverage.
- **Speed:** A reliable connection should provide sufficient speed for video calls, streaming, and downloading files. Some coworking spaces advertise speeds up to 100 Mbps, ideal for heavy users.
- **Stability:** Frequent disconnections can be frustrating. Look for reviews specifically mentioning Wi-Fi reliability to gauge real experiences.
- **Backup options:** Quality coworking spaces often provide backup solutions like mobile hotspots in case their primary connection fails. This is a crucial factor to consider.

Coworking spaces have become a staple for remote workers, enabling productivity and collaboration. Within Tbilisi and other cities, numerous coworking options exist, each with its own Wi-Fi setup. Here are some popular choices:

- **Rooms of Interest:** A vibrant place with great vibes, Rooms of Interest promises excellent internet connectivity. It’s especially popular during the day when its creative atmosphere inspires productivity.
- **PURPLE:** Located in a prime location, PURPLE blends coffee culture and work culture. Users often praise its impressive download and upload speeds.
- **Impact Hub:** Known for fostering entrepreneurship, this workspace provides reliable internet and hosts regular events, offering networking opportunities.

Beyond the coworking spaces, local cafés and restaurants often provide Wi-Fi to attract patrons. However, the quality here can be variable. Many digital nomads prefer to establish a routine at a select few cafés with a solid reputation for stable internet. When scouting for suitable spots to work, here are factors to investigate:

​ -Plan Your Visit to Georgia Here--&gt;https://travels-101.com/explore-everything-georgia-has-to-offer  
- **Connection Quality:** Is the Wi-Fi reliable? Consider asking locals or checking online reviews for insights.
- **Seating Arrangements:** Comfort is key; a cozy corner can make working hours feel less tedious.
- **Power Outlets:** Ensure there are accessible sockets to keep your devices charged.

Despite the allure of Georgia's bustling coworking scene, it pays to plan ahead regarding your connectivity needs. Here are practical strategies that can help:

1. **Research before arrival:** Websites like Nomad List provide data on Wi-Fi speeds in various locales, but checking recent user comments can yield even more reliable information.
2. **Test the connection:** Once you arrive, take time to test the Wi-Fi in your selected coworking space, café, or rental. Consistent testing will help you find stable spots.
3. **Use a Wi-Fi analyzer app:** Downloading a Wi-Fi analyzer app can help you check available networks for signal strength and quality.

It’s important to factor Wi-Fi reliability into your overall experience as a digital nomad in Georgia. While the scenery, cuisine, and culture draw many here, the ability to stay connected and work effectively must not be compromised. It can be a significant stress reliever knowing that reliable internet is always within reach, allowing you to focus on your work while enjoying life in this diverse and vibrant country.

By staying informed and choosing wisely, you can maximize your productivity and enjoy all the perks of the digital nomad lifestyle in Georgia. Embrace the rich experiences and reliable connections that await!

### Conclusion

Georgia’s digital nomad scene presents an appealing landscape for remote workers seeking a balance of vibrant culture, affordable living, and reliable work environments. With a variety of coworking spaces scattered throughout the country, you can find the perfect place to meet your productivity needs. From cozy settings that inspire creativity to bustling hubs fostering collaboration, the options cater to diverse working styles. Notable spaces like Fabrika in Tbilisi or Moonshine in Batumi not only provide the necessary amenities but also a sense of community that can be crucial for nomads.

1idncp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1idncp4/am_i_crazy_for_thinking_my_family_says_im_always/,Am I crazy for thinking my family says I’m always wrong because I’m autistic?,"So I was diagnosed with Autism/asp when I was 3 years old. Social skills are always an issue for me, but at least I’m learning between both good friends who are also autistic, mentors, and therapy. 

So this past Saturday, I read the Costco mailer and was asking my family if they needed anything from the store, trying to start a nice gesture when I go out for my Saturday errands as I buy my own food. One of the deals was on keurig K cups, which my dad always buys, so he gave me the money to go out and buy it.  He always shares the bulk coffee k cups with the household. Come this morning, however, I noticed he hid the whole box all to himself. When I ask if I can get a K cup, he deliberately and literally asks if I can use the same K cup he already used. Thinking in my head that this is really fucked up, I just said “ewww. No” (nicest thing I can think of). He eventually got me one though, but I’m frustrated that I go out of the way to help out…only for him to hide the whole box for himself. 

So I express this to my mom, and she starts acting like the Press Spokeswoman supporting my dad in all he does regardless if he’s wrong or  like every other argument/disagreement, citing “the finances are tough” or “your dad provides”. I can tell she thought it was messed up with the reusing idea through her tone, but she still defends. While I can understand these things to a degree, it seems like it’s an excuse every time. This pattern has been going on for years since I was growing up. 

Along with this frustration, her “finance” excuses also triggered something brewing in my head for a while, in which I was unemployed for a few months very recently (from November until about a week ago), but I still had to contribute the monthly contribution to the household as if nothing happened. They say they’re preparing me for the real world, and when reading what someone debated this topic on Instagram’s Threads, I found this to be wrong after the fact. I bring this up to my mom,   Who says my brother still paid when he was unemployed. True, but I really feel that is because he is passive and won’t speak up for himself. Additionally, my mom cites I get paid more than her, which is true, but I never even got my first paycheck yet and exhausted like half my savings, despite even trying to save when I was unemployed. I express this to my mom, but it doesn’t do anything and convo keeps going on an endless loop. 

So basically what I’m trying to express is I’m starting to see a double standard where my parents can cite financial trouble, but I can’t and still have to go on as if nothing happened with my job. I can’t help the fact I was laid off due to a budget cut, so it’s not like I chose not to work during that time. 

Now after all this, I figured learn from past arguments, and apologize to my brother for witnessing the whole thing and waking him up as the situation got heated, only for him to raise his voice at me saying I’m “delusional” and still having a fit about slamming the door as I went off to work this morning when he is not even my parent. I didn’t even slam the door at all — I closed it quickly.

Sure, I can try using a softer tone when expressing myself, but I’ve noticed that never works either and I’m always dismissed or since they’re overly Christian, I get accused of “not being nice”. Like every negative word to them is treated as if I used every curse word in a sentence, so I feel I’m walking on eggshells. They’ve also threatened to call the cops or put me in the psych ward just because I raise my voice or express myself.

I really don’t want to speak with any of them, but if I don’t, my mom will approach me saying I need to apologize cuz I was wrong. It’s like this every time regardless of argument. Therefore, this is why I feel like my family treats me differently because I’m autistic and I’m not sure if anyone can relate.  It’s like my take on things never gets valued no matter how hard I try. Last argument, I’ve expressed everyone should partake in family therapy, but it’s like everyone forgot about it in time. 

TLDR: I feel no matter how hard I express myself or stand up for whats right or try to make a good gesture or try to learn from the past and apologize, I still get treated poorly and my whole family thinks I’m always the problem because I have autism and Asperger’s. Has this happened to anyone else?

1idnbl2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1idnbl2,I am building my dream bike! Check description,"About 10 months ago, I picked up this retro MTB— a Kona Koa— from Facebook Marketplace. It was in pretty good condition and came at a decent price(check the last picture). My goal was to upgrade it and build my dream bike, but I had two main rules:

	1.	Use only second-hand parts.
	2.	Do all the work myself.
I didn’t quite stick to the first rule (more on that later), but I fully succeeded in the second!

*The Build* (list of components at the bottom)

*I replaced the entire cockpit:*

	•	The bars and stem came from a guy on Facebook Marketplace, who told me they were from Specialized.

	•	From the same seller, I also picked up this purple Univega fork(he took it from an old frame), which happened to be a perfect fit for the frame.
	
•	The grips are ODI, and I bought them from Amazon along with a new cassette.
Next, I wanted to convert it to a 1x drivetrain to follow the trend. 

I started searching for a square-taper crankset that would work with one of the chainrings sold by Stridsland. I found a Deore LX crankset on DBA (Danish eBay), since my previous crankset was riveted and couldn’t be downgraded to a 1x setup (shoutout to r/xbiking people for helping me figure that out!).

Finally, I purchased the chainring, bolts, and stem cup along with the iconic RSDW sticker from the legendary Matias Stridsland.

*The Final Touch*

Two days ago, I finished building the bike myself at a community bike workshop in my city. While I was there, I found an amazing pair of Superstar Components pedals. In return, I gave them my old crankset and pedals.

*The Experience*

This project was such a rewarding experience. I learned a lot—not just from YouTube, but also from the community and the people I bought parts from. It’s amazing to see how much knowledge people are willing to share.

A huge thank you to everyone who helped along the way! If you love biking, I highly recommend taking on a project like this.

Ps: I still have a child dream to have MTB with disc brakes but this will be the next step for this bike.

And now for the list:

*Frame & Fork:*

* Frame: Kona Koa (retro MTB)
* Fork: Purple Univega (from Facebook Marketplace)

*Cockpit:*

* Handlebars: Specialized (from Facebook Marketplace)

* Stem: Specialized (from Facebook Marketplace)

* Grips: ODI (from Amazon)

* Stem cup: Stridsland

*Drivetrain:*

* Crankset: Shimano Deore LX (from DBA - Danish eBay)

* Chainring: Stridsland

* Chainring Bolts: Stridsland

* Cassette: 9 speed shimano (from Amazon)

*others*

* Saddle: Selle italia(took it from my previous road bike)

* Pedals: Superstar Components pedals (found at a community bike workshop)

* Kick stand: pletcher twin( got a Xmas present from my girlfriend)

* Stickers: RSDW from Stridsland and Comnadante(coffee grinder)",7,1738244862.0,xbiking,0,0.89,False
1idnarj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1idnarj/breville_barista_touch_bes880bss_review_for/,Breville Barista Touch BES880BSS review for coffee enthusiasts who love convenience,"After months of contemplation, I decided to take the plunge and invest in the Breville Barista Touch BES880BSS Espresso Machine, and let me share my experience with you. As someone who thrives on caffeine and enjoys experimenting with coffee styles, this machine has been part of my daily routine. From its sleek brushed stainless steel design to its user-friendly features, this espresso machine offers plenty, though it’s not without its quirks.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The Breville Barista Touch BES880BSS has a modern aesthetic that fits perfectly in my kitchen. Its brushed stainless steel finish is not only visually appealing but also feels sturdy and durable. The touchscreen interface is intuitive, and the compact design means it doesn’t dominate counter space. While it’s quite hefty at 21.8 pounds, this weight adds to its premium feel and stability during operation. The included accessories, like the stainless steel jug and portafilter, are of excellent quality, though I wish the water tank was slightly easier to access.

Curious if the Breville Barista Touch BES880BSS fits your coffee needs? [Check Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/breville-bes880bss-barista-touch-review-b078wmlxxg/)

**Brewing Performance**  
This machine excels in performance with its integrated burr grinder and programmable settings. The grind size can be customized with 30 precision options, ensuring consistency for every shot. I’ve tested it with various coffee beans, and the machine consistently delivers rich espresso with a beautiful crema. However, the grinder can get a bit noisy, especially early in the morning when others are still asleep. The heating system is impressively fast, and the transition from grinding to brewing is seamless, which is a lifesaver during busy mornings.

**Coffee Flavor**  
The flavor of the espresso is top-notch. Whether it’s a bold shot or a smooth latte, the Breville Barista Touch BES880BSS delivers every time. I’ve used it to make americanos, cappuccinos, and flat whites. The milk frother deserves special mention here—it creates microfoam that’s perfect for latte art or just a creamy texture. My kids love hot chocolate with frothy milk, and this machine has made me quite popular at home. However, achieving the perfect tamping pressure can be tricky at first, and it might take a bit of practice.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**  
Cleaning the Breville Barista Touch BES880BSS is mostly straightforward. The removable drip tray and internal cleaning alerts are helpful, but the grinder’s internal parts can be challenging to clean thoroughly. The machine also includes a hidden tool tray behind the drip tray, which is perfect for storing extra baskets and tools. I recommend keeping a microfiber cloth handy to wipe down the brushed stainless steel exterior to maintain its polished look.

**Pros**

* The touchscreen interface is intuitive and simplifies coffee-making.
* Integrated burr grinder offers consistency with multiple grind settings.
* Milk frother produces excellent microfoam, ideal for lattes or cappuccinos.
* Compact, premium design with durable materials.

**Cons**

* Grinder can be noisy, especially in quiet spaces.
* Accessing the water tank isn’t as convenient as it could be.
* Cleaning the grinder’s internal components requires effort.
* Tamping pressure can be tricky for first-time users.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
When I compare the Breville Barista Touch BES880BSS to competitors like the Gaggia Classic Pro or the DeLonghi La Specialista, the Breville stands out for its touchscreen interface and integrated grinder. The Gaggia Classic Pro offers a more manual experience, which some might prefer, but it lacks the seamless integration of features. DeLonghi’s models are excellent but tend to fall short on frothing performance. Breville’s milk frother is significantly superior, producing café-style microfoam that elevates the coffee experience. However, if you’re looking for a quieter machine, the DeLonghi might have an edge.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
While the Breville Barista Touch BES880BSS sits in the higher price range for home espresso machines, it delivers good value for its features. The combination of grinder, frother, and intuitive controls makes it an all-in-one solution. For someone who spends a lot on café visits, this machine could pay itself off in a matter of months. That said, if you’re on a tight budget, there are more affordable machines that can provide decent espresso but might lack the sophistication and ease of use.

**Features and User Experience**  
The programmable touchscreen interface is a game-changer. It allows you to personalize your coffee settings, from grind size to milk texture. Adjusting these settings was straightforward, and I even saved a custom profile for my morning latte. The integrated burr grinder eliminates the need for a separate grinder, saving counter space. One thing to note is the heating system, which is remarkably fast, bringing the machine to brewing temperature in seconds. This feature alone has saved me countless minutes on hectic mornings.

The automatic milk frothing feature is another highlight. I tested it with whole milk and oat milk, and the results were consistently creamy and smooth. My co-worker, who borrowed the machine for a weekend, was amazed at how easy it was to create café-style beverages without prior experience. The built-in water filter is another thoughtful addition, ensuring the coffee’s taste isn’t compromised by water quality.

**Final Thoughts (Not in the review but implied)**  
The Breville Barista Touch BES880BSS is a fantastic addition to any coffee lover’s kitchen. It combines convenience with quality, making it a worthwhile investment for those who value their daily brew. While not perfect, its strengths far outweigh its minor shortcomings. Whether you’re a seasoned barista or a beginner, this machine will elevate your coffee game.

I’m looking to upgrade my coffee setup and want to take things a bit more seriously now. I mainly drink latte-based drinks, so I thought a dual boiler would be the best option for me, but I’m still open to any recommendations.

I’m not an expert, but I’d love to learn more about how to pull the best espresso with the new equipment I’m planning to get. Ideally, I’d like a machine that isn’t too complex to operate, but at the same time, I really appreciate a great shot of espresso.

I know it’s best to get a separate grinder, so I’m considering either the DF64 II or the Niche Zero, but I’m open to suggestions in case there’s a better option.

I’m not a fan of long warm-up times, so a machine that heats up in less than 20 minutes would be ideal.

With that said, I’m looking forward to receiving some great advice and finally making my purchase asap!

Thanks a lot, I’m in your hands now! :)

I've not done any findom but am aware of it as a long term fetishist and male submissive with past dominant female partners. I have a low libido and never really wanted to have sex with my partners, but love to feel their control. So it's not a sexual or arousal thing for me. I just feel at peace when someone takes control. In the past my lack of sexual interest eventually caused issues in my relationships and so I find myself being a single.    
  
I have tried engaging in femdom and findom online as it feels it should tick some boxes for me. But I could not get into the right emotional space with people I never saw in real life. 

Now for the last 2 years I've had a Personal Trainer. We are quite different. I'm 15 years older than her. She is a very attractive young woman who used to work as an aerial artist before setting up as a PT. I'm a middle aged finance guy and huge nerd.  

Yet at some point after our session she started asking me if I'd stay around for a coffee. Ever since that was part of a weekly routine. Over the last year we have met up even more often, walk the dogs together on weekends, I've helped her with things like getting a car repaired and some basic home DIY, whilst she's scheduled me in for free additional sessions to 'repay that debt'. I'd say we see each other at the moment for 5-10 hours every week. She does not have a partner, and when she had a short fling with someone I got plenty of the gossip about the guy from her. 

My only friend who is closer to me is my housemate. We've been sharing a flat/house on and off for nearly 30 years, which was when we went to uni. Now from the outside we likely look like a gay couple as we also usually spend 2 out of 3 holidays a year together. We are completely attuned to each other so living together feels like not having to compromise ever, whilst having someone around if you feel lonely. 

Now here's the issue. Both me and my housmate are on comparable incomes and earn a lot more than my PT and friend. In March we are heading on our next holiday and I love to talk about it but also see that my PT could not afford this type of trip. The same goes for going out for dinner. The places I love to eat are on the more expensive side and I hold back even talking about them with her. 

If she wanted to I'd love for her to just experience the lifestyle I live without having to think too much about my budget and can still save a fair bit. I'd want her to have the money to be able to budget similarly to how we budget. And I'd love to talk about an experience and see her smile because we can both experience things. I would not be surprised if she asked to join us on our trips, but I would also want it all open to her, if she'd rather take a trip somewhere else with someone else so be it. 

I would describe my emotional attachment to her as more than just a friendship. I'd even say I love her in a way, probably more like I'd love a daughter than a partner, but when she is sad about something, I feel down as well. 

So here is my dilemma. I'm not sure how to approach it. I feel it's not that different to what a relationship with a responsible findom would be like. But then I'm not sure she could even get into that mindset. 

I am confident she would not abuse getting a card from me, but I wonder if it would be awkward if I offer. I thought about offering for her to join our holiday trips all paid for, but again it feels odd and also would assume she actually fancies coming along with us. 

I'm feeling unsure what to do, any ideas from those of you who engage in this as a fetish would be welcome. ",7,1738244165.0,paypigsupportgroup,3,1.0,False

-----------------------------------------------------------

When considering how much to buy a gift card, several factors come into play. It's essential to think about whom you're buying for, their interests, and the occasion to ensure your gift is received positively. These decisions can make gift card purchasing both enjoyable and meaningful. Here’s a detailed look at some key aspects to ponder.

### Know Your Recipient

Understanding your recipient's preferences is crucial. Ask yourself:

- What are their favorite stores or brands?
- Do they prefer specific products or services?
- What hobbies or interests do they have?

This insight allows you to choose a gift card that aligns with their tastes and lifestyle. A personalized gift card indicates thoughtfulness, making it more special.

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
### Consider the Occasion

The occasion often influences the amount you choose. Different events can call for different spending levels. Here are some common scenarios:

- **Birthday:** For birthdays, gift cards can range from $20 to $100, depending on your relationship with the recipient.
- **Holiday:** During holidays, consider a higher range, especially for close family members, typically between $50 to $150.
- **Graduation:** A graduation gift card can vary widely. Aim for $50 to $200, depending on your budget and closeness to the graduate.
- **Thank You or Appreciation:** For small gestures, anything from $10 to $50 can be appropriate.

Matching the value of the card to the event's significance can make your gift feel more appropriate.

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
### Your Budget Matters

Setting a budget plays a vital role in deciding how much to buy a gift card. Check your financial situation and decide how much you can comfortably spend. Having a clear budget will prevent overspending and help narrow your options, ensuring you choose a gift that won’t stretch your finances too thin.

### Flexibility of Gift Cards

Gift cards come in various values, typically ranging from $10 to $500. Consider how flexible the card is for your recipient. Some cards can only be used at specific retailers, while others are more versatile. A more versatile card, like a Visa or Mastercard gift card, allows the recipient to select exactly what they need, often making it a wise choice.

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
### Recipient’s Needs

Think about what the recipient may currently need. A gift card can be practical, allowing the person to pick something they truly want or need. For instance, if you know they recently moved, a gift card to a local home goods store could be especially helpful. This approach shows you cared enough to consider their current circumstances.

### Future Purchases

Another factor is whether the recipient is likely to be able to use the card in the near future. If there's a sale or a specific season (like back-to-school shopping or holiday sales), opting for a larger amount might be a good idea. You can make a gift card much more impactful when it's paired with an upcoming sale that your recipient loves.

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
### Special Promotions

Keep an eye out for promotional deals when purchasing gift cards. Sometimes retailers offer bonuses for larger purchases, such as ""buy a $100 gift card and get $20 free."" Taking advantage of these promotions can help you give a more valuable gift without spending significantly more.

### Wrapping Up the Gift

How you present the gift card can also reflect its value. Pairing the card with a heartfelt note or packaging it nicely can amplify its sentiment. This small gesture adds a personal touch, showing that you've devoted time and effort into preparing a great gift.

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
When deciding how much to buy a gift card, weigh all these factors: consider the recipient’s preferences, the occasion, your budget, the flexibility of the card, their needs, the timing of future purchases, and any special promotions. A thoughtful approach can transform a simple gift card into a cherished memory, making it a wonderful gift-giving choice.

The Benefits of Gifting Different Amounts on Gift Cards
-------------------------------------------------------

Choosing the right gift card amount can make a significant difference in both the giver and the receiver's experience. Whether you are celebrating a birthday, holiday, or a special milestone, understanding the benefits of gifting different amounts on gift cards can enhance your gifting strategy.

### The Joy of Personalization

When you select a specific amount for a gift card, you show that you’ve considered the recipient's preferences. Personalizing the amount allows you to align your gift with their needs or wishes. Here are some tips on how to decide:

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
- **Budget:\*\* Consider your own budget and how much you are comfortable spending.**
- **Recipient's Tastes:\*\* Think about the recipient's interests. A hobbyist may appreciate a larger card for their favorite shop.**
- **Occasion:\*\* Different occasions can warrant different amounts. A small amount is perfect for casual gatherings, while significant events might call for a more generous gift.**

### Encouraging Thoughtful Choices

Gift cards often empower the recipient to choose what they truly want or need. By varying the amount, you can encourage thoughtful spending:

- **Small Amounts:\*\* For simple thank-you gestures, smaller amounts can help convey appreciation without being overwhelming.**
- **Medium Amounts:\*\* These amounts can encourage the person to make a specific purchase, allowing them to treat themselves to something nice.**
- **Large Amounts:\*\* A generous gift card can make a significant purchase more achievable, such as a new gadget or wardrobe enhancement.**

### Enhancing the Gifting Experience

Gift cards also enhance the overall gifting experience. Here’s how different amounts can affect it:

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
- **Create Excitement:\*\* A higher value gift card often generates more excitement. The recipient might indulge in a brand they typically wouldn't splurge on.**
- **Promote Exploration:\*\* With a gift card of a medium amount, recipients may choose to explore new products or services, broadening their shopping experience.**
- **Drive Engagement:\*\* A strategically placed gift card can invite recipients back to the store multiple times, leading to a deeper connection with the brand.**

### Building Relationships

Gift cards can also help strengthen your relationships with others:

- **Friendship Maintenance:\*\* A small gift card for coffee or snacks can maintain friendships without excessive expenditures.**
- **Family Bonds:\*\* Larger amounts for family members can signify your willingness to contribute to hobbies or larger family expenses.**
- **Showcasing Thoughtfulness:\*\* When you put thought into the gift card amount, it creates an impression of care and attention to detail.**

### Utility in Various Situations

Different scenarios often require unique gift amounts:

Check The Details Here: http://richdaddydating.com/AIfluencers-Premium  
  
- **Corporate Gifting:\*\* Businesses often opt for larger gift card amounts to express gratitude towards significant clients or employees.**
- **Weddings or Showers:\*\* During events like weddings, gift cards can serve as thoughtful contributions towards the couple's honeymoon or home expenses.**
- **Holidays and Celebrations:\*\* During holidays, customizing gift card amounts to match the recipient’s needs is key to making the celebration brighter.**

Understanding the benefits of gifting different amounts on gift cards helps you make informed decisions for every occasion. By considering various factors, you can create meaningful experiences for the recipients on special days. Whether you choose smaller amounts for casual outings or larger cards for significant events, the gift card can be tailored to reflect your relationship with the recipient.

Ultimately, it's about creating joy and meaningful connections—gift cards have the potential to do just that when chosen wisely.

### Conclusion

Deciding how much to buy on a gift card involves careful consideration of various factors. First, think about the recipient's preferences and needs. A well-chosen amount shows that you understand what they enjoy, whether it’s a small sum for a coffee shop or a larger value for a special occasion. It’s also worth considering the occasion itself; birthdays might call for a more generous gift, while a casual thank you could be modest.

Additionally, gifting different amounts can have a significant impact. For instance, a smaller gift card can provide a fun treat, encouraging the recipient to indulge in something they might not usually buy for themselves. A larger amount, on the other hand, can help with a more substantial purchase, like clothing or electronics, which can be even more meaningful. Choosing the right amount can lead to not just appreciation but also shows your thoughtfulness.

Consider your budget. It’s essential to give a gift that is both generous and within your means. No matter how much you decide to spend on the card, it’s the thought that counts.

1idmsx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1idmsx0/alternative_method_of_paper_tea_filters_for/,Alternative method of paper tea filters for better tasting tea?,"In the past I bought a couple of boxes of finum tea filters, one of the best rated such tea bag/filters online taht I saw. Unfortunately I discovered a very pronounced paper taste, at least to me. 

I have a cast iron teapot and a hario v60 and Kalita ceramic coffee filter holder. I started to experiment and thought it might have a less papery taste if I pre-wetted the paper filter and gently poured the tea through it. I could minimize impact as well by pouring 50% of the tea into the glass and then the remainder this way. This reduces the papery taste seeping into the tea by having it sit in the tea for several minutes not prewetted. I'm sure I'm far from the first thinking about this and wonder if others do or have tried.",1,1738243269.0,tea,4,1.0,False
1idms70,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1idms70/looking_for_a_clever_work_setup/,Looking for a clever work set-up,"After falling into the rabbit hole of speciality coffee I am not really enjoying the coffee at work anymore. While it's not bad, it does not even come close to the coffees I brew at home during the weekends.

I don't directly want to go all-out so I am looking for a cheap and clever work set-up. Because I am not brewing any coffee during the week I can bring my scale and grinder to work. It however feels like a hassle to bring my electric kettle every single week. Would it be an idea to use a regular kettle (no gooseneck) and use a drip assist?

Another question would be; do you use cheaper beans at work? For now it is relatively cheap because I only brew during the weekends. My bank account won't like it I race through bags of expensive beans.

Any tips/recommendations are welcome!",4,1738243206.0,pourover,9,1.0,False

1idmqkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1idmqkj/are_women_more_interested_in_socialising_than_men/,Are women more interested in socialising than men or is it just my impression?,"I will be single soon and am 44 years old. I have been preparing for this for a while so the pain phase has already been dealt with.

I know I will never willingly subject myself to the torture of doing dating as an activity. 
I would hope to meet someone organically and would not be in any particular rush.

However, I noticed that all the book clubs, art groups and meetups are full of women. 
In the meetups I organise there are so many wonderful women who love talking and sharing their life experience. The  hours with them are so refreshing.

I wonder if men are just generally more lazy in this respect and prefer to skip all the socialising, click or swipe, meet someone....boom...done ...back to the sofa watching TV. This is my idea of hell.

I organise interesting  events and men instead of signing up just send me a message and ask me if I would like to grab a coffee sometime.
For me this attitude will be a no go even when I am single  as it shows that a man like that will never be interested in going out and exploring.
 I am not interested in a boring life. If men cannot even bother to come to an art exhibition and would prefer a date with a stranger...what will they bring to the table?

This is the reason why it is being so hard to break up with my partner.
He is always up to do something, visit new places, go to the theatre or the restaurant. 
The problem is that we have become best buddies rather than lovers. 

Is my diagnosis correct? Are men generally less curious and adventurous? ",0,1738243060.0,dating_advice,19,0.4,False

I don’t think we could drink enough to make it worth the cost, especially after hearing stories about drinks not being allowed in the theater and slow service getting drinks at dinner.

Start forming your local support networks now.,"It's nice to see the community so unified on Reddit but as we know things can fracture quickly and attention spans can be diverted.

There may end up being 4 years of intimidation, isolation tactics, and dismantling of various programs. History has shown that the ONLY way to get setup for the long haul is to have a local support network for information sharing and support (whether that is social, monetary, legal, or otherwise). Even just sharing a coffee with others in the face of adversity can be powerful.

Reach out to others locally to form groups offline in addition to being here on Reddit. Check out your local union. Check for local legal resources. We are all going to need some extra help.",32,1738242942.0,fednews,2,0.89,False

I love my mom and I am super grateful for all the help she's given us. I don't know how we would have afforded our baby without my mom opening her doors to us (we were living across the country completely alone before. We *could* have done it it just would have been super tight.).

But sometimes I can't help but feel she is too much. 

Right now what set me off is I was preparing breakfast for my baby. Like a lot of us (I think) I try to save the fruits/dessert type options for the end of the meal. Baby was super happy playing on her own while I made her eggs and green beans. Then my mom shows up, gives her a freaking muffin, and then swoops off into her own room the moment the baby starts whining for more muffin and refusing the eggs.  So essentially she's come in, caused problems where there weren't any, and then left so she wouldn't have to deal with the fallout. 

My mom does stuff similar to this all the time. Popping out and adding a ""fun"" element before disappearing leaving baby upset and me to deal with the fallout. 

That's not including the fact that she spends half the time around me complaining about everything from how I dress baby, to how I should take her outside but also I need to clean the kitchen and not really giving me a clear out. 

I am a super clean person. My friends and other family were shocked when they found out my mom complains about me. My mom has literally said I'm not ""allowed"" to leave the house until it's clean. Which I *do*. I do dishes, wipe counters (including glass tables, mirrors etc) vacuum, mop, and organize EVERY. DAY. And it's not just my stuff. I'm doing my mom's dishes And my little brothers as well. I bought a new vacuum almost a year ago now to replace my mom's that was falling apart. She tried to use it like a month ago and had a fit cause she didn't know how to use it. Shows how much she cleans in her own house. I've had to resort to taking photos of the kitchen at night before I go to bed because my mom would bitch at me that there was a pile of dishes in the morning. HER dishes that she refused to admit were all hers because she comes home later and makes herself dinner. 

She'll say the baby should go outside, take the baby out, knock on the window saying ""come out. Baby cAnt be alone."" Because I foolishly thought since it was her idea and she grabbed baby she'd play out there with her. So I stop doing the dishes and go outside. Only for her to go inside and then immediately come back out to bitch at me how the dishes aren't done. 

I feel like I'm going crazy sometimes! 

We're about two months away from paying off our credit cards (ironically most of it is from the move here) and then we can start saving for a house. Far away from here.


Edit

Omgggg she just right now asked me to clean up the kitchen. I cleaned up everything from my making breakfast. Baby is playing quietly while I have my coffee. No, she means HER breakfast mess. She has stuff to do in the kitchen after so she needs me to clean up while she does I don't even know what. I'm tired y'all.",1,1738242651.0,Mommit,4,1.0,False

1idmj3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1idmj3o/athome_teeth_whitening_that_actually_worked_for/,At-Home Teeth Whitening That Actually Worked for Me: My Laughland Review,"Teeth whitening is something I’ve thought about for years but never really committed to. I’ve tried a few drugstore options here and there—whitening strips, toothpaste, even charcoal powder—but nothing gave me the bright, even results I was hoping for. Plus, my teeth are pretty sensitive, so most whitening products left me in pain.

That’s when I came across **Laughland teeth whitening**. The idea of a **dentist-formulated whitening gel** with an **LED mouthpiece** sounded more promising than the typical over-the-counter options, so I decided to give it a try. Here’s everything you need to know if you’re considering it too.

# Why I Chose Laughland Over Other Whitening Methods

I drink a lot of coffee and tea, so my teeth had noticeable stains that regular brushing didn’t touch. Professional whitening at a dentist’s office felt too expensive, with treatments often costing $500 or more. Plus, I’d heard that professional treatments can cause serious sensitivity.

What caught my eye about Laughland was its combination of professional-grade whitening gel and LED light technology—something you’d normally only get in a clinic but packaged for home use. And unlike some products that claim overnight results, Laughland’s six-day routine felt realistic.

# What’s Included in the Laughland Whitening Kit?

When the kit arrived, everything I needed was in the box:

1. **Whitening Gel Pens**: These make it easy to apply the gel evenly to your teeth.
2. **LED Mouthpiece**: The mouthpiece activates the gel, boosting its whitening effect.
3. **Instructions**: A simple guide that explains the steps in a way that makes the process foolproof.

The packaging felt sleek and organized—nothing messy or complicated.

# How I Used the Laughland Whitening Kit

Each whitening session takes only 10 minutes a day:

1. **Brush and Dry Your Teeth**: This helps the gel stick better.
2. **Apply the Gel**: Twist the pen to release the gel and coat your teeth evenly.
3. **Insert the LED Mouthpiece**: Turn it on, pop it in, and wait for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse and Clean**: After the timer goes off, rinse your mouth and clean the mouthpiece.

It’s super convenient—I used it while watching TV or scrolling on my phone, so the 10 minutes flew by.

# Day-by-Day Results

* **Day 1**: No major changes after the first session, but my teeth felt cleaner.
* **Day 3**: I started noticing subtle brightening. Some of the surface stains from coffee and tea were fading.
* **Day 6**: By the end of the cycle, my teeth were noticeably whiter—around 6–7 shades brighter. The results looked even and natural, not overly white or “fake.”

One thing I loved: **no sensitivity**. In the past, whitening strips left me wincing whenever I drank something cold, but I didn’t experience that at all with Laughland.

# What Sets Laughland Apart from Other Whitening Products

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel**: The whitening gel was developed to be strong enough to remove stains but gentle on enamel.
2. **LED Light Activation**: The LED mouthpiece helps the gel work faster and penetrate deeper into the enamel.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients**: The gel is stored in a controlled environment, so it stays potent—unlike some drugstore gels that lose their strength over time.

**Want to learn more about the kit? You can check it out** [**here**](https://getlaughland.com/offer-01/?lpid=1039&source_id=DL&utm_source=8928&utm_medium=&utm_term=1039&aff_id=8928&sub_id=&req_id=&oid=1039&device_type=&country_name=&oid=1039&affid=8928&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)**.**

# How Laughland Compares to Other Whitening Methods

Here’s how Laughland performed compared to other products I’ve tried:

* **Whitening Strips**: Caused sensitivity and gave uneven results.
* **Whitening Toothpaste**: Good for maintenance but didn’t make a dent in deeper stains.
* **Professional Whitening**: Very effective but pricey and often uncomfortable.

Laughland felt like the perfect balance—effective, affordable, and gentle on my teeth.

# FAQs About Laughland Teeth Whitening

Here are some common questions I had before trying it:

1. **Is it safe for enamel?** Yes! The gel is formulated to remove stains without damaging enamel.
2. **Does it work on old stains?** Absolutely—it helped with both recent coffee stains and older discoloration.
3. **How long do the results last?** This depends on your habits. Avoiding staining foods and practicing good oral hygiene can help your results last for months.

# Tips for the Best Results

1. **Stay Consistent**: Use it every day for the full six-day cycle.
2. **Avoid Staining Foods**: Try to cut back on coffee, tea, and red wine while whitening your teeth.
3. **Maintain Oral Hygiene**: Brush and floss regularly to help preserve your brighter smile.

# Final Thoughts

For me, Laughland teeth whitening lived up to its promise. It was easy to use, fit seamlessly into my routine, and delivered results without causing sensitivity. My teeth looked brighter but still natural—not the kind of bright that looks fake or forced.

If you’re considering an at-home whitening kit but worried about sensitivity or complicated steps, this might be worth trying. It’s not as drastic as an in-office whitening treatment, but it’s a great option if you want a gradual improvement you can notice within a week.

Dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""   
   
Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""   
""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it."" So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,   
""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in!"" 

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still sceptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.   
""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says. 

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.   
""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go.   
At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a coffee first and catch up."" 

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else. 

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.   
""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.   
Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope."" He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican. 

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.   
Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""   
His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",10,1738242007.0,Jokes,3,0.71,False

After owning 3 dogs and 2 kids, my rugs were so dirty I considered just throwing them out and calling it minimalism. But first, I decided to check out some decent carpet cleaning machines until I settled on this one from Shark. 

Here's my thoughts. 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Update:

**BEST PRICE on the Shark PX202BRNCarpet Cleaner Machine here:**

[**https://amzn.to/4ghlZfX**](https://amzn.to/4ghlZfX)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

My expectations were low. I’ve been burned by cleaning gadgets before. Still, I was desperate. My couch had become a mosaic of coffee spills, mystery stains, and what I can only assume was a failed attempt at finger painting by my toddler. The rugs had also seen better days, like, pre-dog days. 

At first glance, the Shark PX202BRN feels like a hybrid between a Dyson vacuum and a high-tech espresso machine. It’s pretty compact and surprisingly lightweight, which is actually great news for me since my upper body strength maxes out at opening pickle jars. It's like they somehow compressed a full-sized carpet cleaner into something that could reasonably fit in an apartment closet.

# My Favorite Features

**Dual-activated formula.** The Shark comes with two cleaning solutions, a 16oz Deep Clean Pro Formula and a 32oz OXY Multiplier Formula. These mix together inside the machine like a science experiment. So there's no complicated setup really. Just fill, click, and go. 

**Powerful suction.** If you’ve ever used a portable carpet cleaner before, you know how frustrating it can be when half the liquid stays behind, leaving your carpet damp and gross for days. Not the case with the Shark. Its suction is legit. After using it on my couch, I was genuinely shocked by how dry everything felt almost immediately.

**Lightweight and portable.** It’s easy to carry upstairs or maneuver around tight spaces like couch corners and staircases. If you’ve ever tried lugging a full-sized steam cleaner up a flight of stairs, you’ll appreciate this feature more than words can express.

**Attachments.** The Shark comes with four tools, each designed for specific cleaning tasks. The 7"" wide path tool is good for tackling large areas quickly, and the 3.5"" reversible bristle tool gets into those pesky nooks and crannies. There's also a pet tool which is definitely worth using if you have dogs.

# Pros

* **Saves time and sanity.** With the Shark, cleanup after my kids and dogs takes minutes, leaving you more time to binge-watch Netflix or cry quietly in the shower.

* **Compact storage.** Unlike bulky steam cleaners, the Shark fits neatly in a closet or under the sink. Out of sight, out of mind. Until disaster strikes again.

* **Budget-friendly.** For the price, it gives pretty good value. The cleaning solutions it comes with last awhile, and it's a powerful model that does everything I need. 

# Cons

The water tank is kinda small, so you’ll need to refill it frequently for bigger jobs. Also, while the suction is strong, it’s not quite as powerful as larger models like the Bissell Little Green. Lastly, the hose is short, meaning you’ll have to move the unit around often. But hey, no one said life was easy.

# Final Thoughts

Who’s this for? Anyone with pets, kids, or a tendency to spill things. If you live in a constant state of “oh crap, how do I fix this now?” mode, the Shark PX202BRN is def a great thing to have around. But if you’re looking for a heavy-duty deep cleaner for entire rooms, you might want to opt for something bigger.

The campus is a sandbox for trust-fund babies to LARP as entrepreneurs—because nothing says “innovation” like a juicero reboot funded by Dad’s hedge fund. Their mantra? “Change the world.” Translation: “Inflate a unicorn’s valuation before regulators notice.” Bonus: Their “self-reflection” seminars are just group therapy for realizing you’re a hypocrite with a Tesla.

**Wharton (UPenn):**  
Wharton: Where finance bros reduce human existence to Excel macros. They’ll teach you to monetize your grandma’s funeral (“synergies!”) and justify layoffs as “optimizing human capital.” Social life? It’s a DCF analysis—you’re only worth their time if your net present value includes a Goldman internship. Pro tip: Their “ethics” course is taught by the ghost of Enron’s CFO.

**MIT Sloan:**  
Sloan: The only people who think love is a “data-driven algorithm” and friendships are “networking nodes.” They’ll blockchain your birthday party and machine-learn your divorce. Sure, they can code a robot to cry, but actual tears? Only when they realize their startup’s “disruption” is just Uber for raccoons.

**Columbia Business School:**  
Columbia: Welcome to Columbia, where you pay $250K to fight rats for subway space while pretending to enjoy your 800-square-foot “luxury” apartment in Midtown. CBS markets itself as “at the center of business,” which is true if your definition of business is being a second-choice finance bro who couldn’t get into Wharton. You’ll spend two years desperately networking at overpriced speakeasies, only to realize that the PE firms you dream of don’t even recruit at CBS. But hey, at least you can flex your *New York experience*—until you’re outbid on an Uber ride by a Booth kid who knows how to use a discount code.

**Chicago Booth:**  
Booth: Where fun goes to die, replaced by regressions proving it never existed. These economists will model your toddler’s tantrum into a stochastic calculus problem. Their idea of a wild night? Debating monopolistic competition… *over warm LaCroix*. Alumni? They’re the ones shorting your dreams.

**Kellogg (Northwestern):**  
Kellogg: Where extroverts go to high-five each other into oblivion. Team projects? More like group delusions that synergy can fix bad ideas. Their “Kellogg grit” is just performative optimism masking panic—like a TED Talk on “embracing failure” after their oat-milk bar flops.

**Yale SOM:**  
Yale SOM: Where rich kids cosplay as Mother Teresa while speed-dating McKinsey recruiters. Their “mission-driven” ethos is writing a thinkpiece about income inequality… from a Nantucket timeshare. The “raw” case study method? Just professors gaslighting you into believing your nonprofit consulting project matters (spoiler: it doesn’t). Graduates go on to “change the world” by privatizing it.

**Tuck (Dartmouth):**  
Tuck: Ah, Tuck—the ultimate group project masquerading as a business school. You wanted a tight-knit community, but what you got was two years of mandatory bonding in the middle of nowhere, where your biggest weekend plan is getting blackout drunk in a ski lodge with the same 280 people. The alumni network is cult-like, sure, but mostly because everyone is desperately clinging to their collective Stockholm Syndrome. Tuckies love to say their rural isolation builds character, but let’s be honest—it’s just an excuse for the fact that no top PE firm recruits in the woods of New Hampshire.

**NYU Stern:**  
Stern: The business school where ambition meets perpetual disappointment. You applied because you wanted the “NYC experience,” but now you’re just another MBA student paying $3,500/month to live in a glorified shoebox while dodging puddles of mysterious subway liquid. Stern kids love to claim they’re just as good as Columbia, which is cute—like a toddler insisting they can drive. Finance bros who couldn’t get into Wharton end up here, spending two years telling themselves that JP Morgan front-office jobs totally recruit from Stern… and then settling for wealth management in New Jersey.

**Berkeley Haas:**  
Haas: Where they preach “ethical leadership” while hustling for Amazon roles. Their “conscious capitalism” is just capitalism with a compostable logo. Don’t be fooled by the tie-dye—these hippies will ESG-wash your pension fund and charge you a consulting fee.

**Michigan Ross:**  
Ross: Where Midwestern “nice” masks a seething rage that you didn’t get into Booth. You’ll bond with classmates over two things: snowstorms in April and the collective delusion that Ann Arbor isn’t a glorified cornfield. Their famed “team culture” is just group therapy for realizing your post-MBA job is in… *checks notes*… Toledo.

**Duke Fuqua:**  
Fuqua: Where Southern hospitality dies screaming in a KPMG breakout room. “Team Fuqua” is a cult that confuses forced camaraderie with Stockholm syndrome. You’ll spend two years Photoshopping basketball players into your LinkedIn posts and pretending Durham isn’t a parking lot with a university attached. Fun fact: Their “leadership” program is taught by the guy who invented shrinkflation.

**UVA Darden:**  
Darden: The case method’s answer to waterboarding. You’ll grind through 500 cases just to realize your “general management” degree qualifies you to middle-manage a Best Buy in suburban Virginia. Their “collegial environment” is just trauma bonding over the fact that Charlottesville’s biggest export is Civil War reenactors and regret.

**London Business School:**  
LBS: the perfect place to get an “elite” MBA while simultaneously being irrelevant in the U.S. market. You’ll spend two years convincing yourself that *global exposure* makes up for the fact that no one outside of Europe respects your degree. LBS grads love to flex their international classmates, but in reality, it just means you’ll get ghosted by recruiters in *multiple* time zones. And let’s not forget the biggest joke of all—thinking you’ll “network with finance execs” when all you’re really doing is begging for internships at Canary Wharf while dodging rain 300 days a year.

**INSEAD:**  
INSEAD: The one-year MBA program for people who want to pretend they’re getting the same experience as an American MBA—just with more existential dread packed into half the time. INSEAD prides itself on being the “business school for the world,” but let’s be real: it’s mostly a playground for consultants who didn’t want to waste two years getting the same McKinsey job they already had. And the whole campus in Fontainebleau thing? Congrats, you get to spend your MBA years stuck in a French village that makes New Haven look like Las Vegas. Oh, and if you choose the Singapore campus, enjoy melting in 100% humidity while realizing that no one in the U.S. actually cares about your degree.

*Disclaimer: These schools are all fine, probably. But if you’re weeping into your Patagonia vest, maybe ask yourself why you’re paying $2,500 per credit to be roasted by a chatbot.*",78,1738241413.0,MBA,9,0.91,False

In the chaotic universe of cryptocurrency, where Pepe coins cats and Dogecoin shibes bark for attention, a new memecoin has stormed onto the scene with a satirical edge: Thomas Douglas Homan (TDH). Inspired by the infamous “DEPORT master” and his no-nonsense reputation, this token isn’t just another joke—it’s a turbocharged meme machine for the crypto anarchist who loves dark humor and bureaucratic absurdity.

Who Is Thomas Douglas Homan?

Thomas Douglas Homan, the namesake of this gloriously unhinged token, is a real-life figure best known for his tough-on-immigration rhetoric as a former ICE official. But in the meme-ified crypto realm, $HOMAN reimagines him as a cartoonish anti-hero: a suit-wearing, coffee-chugging bureaucrat who “gets things done”… even if that means deporting weak-handed crypto traders to “FUD Island.” The coin’s mascot—a stern-faced caricature holding a “DEPORT” stamp in one hand and a “To the Moon!” rocket in the other—perfectly captures its mission: mixing political satire with crypto’s lawless spirit.

Origins: Born from a Twitter Troll Army

Rumor has it $HOMAN was conceived during a 3 a.m. Twitter feud between crypto degens and politics junkies. Someone joked, “What if we made a token for the guy who deports Shiba Inu to the pound?” The name “Thomas Douglas Homan” trended instantly, and within hours, a token contract dropped alongside a website featuring Homan’s face Photoshopped onto Mount Rushmore. The rest is meme history.

Why $HOMAN Isn’t Just Another Shitcoin

The “DEPORT Weak Hands” Mechanism
TDH’s developers added a ruthless twist: sell your tokens too early, and your wallet gets hit with a “DEPORT” notice—a meme-filled PDF of Homan lecturing you about “diamond hands” while your remaining tokens are burned. It’s the crypto equivalent of getting sent to meme jail.

Meme Campaigns That Border on Chaos
The community hosts weekly contests like “Design Homan’s Next Executive Order” (winners include “Ban Paper Hands from the Moon Mission” and “Build the Wall Street Bets”).

Someone joked, “What if we made a token for the guy who deports Shiba Inu to the pound?” The name “Thomas Douglas Homan” trended instantly, and within hours, a token contract dropped alongside a website featuring Homan’s face Photoshopped onto Mount Rushmore. The rest is meme history.

Why $HOMAN Isn’t Just Another Shitcoin

The “DEPORT Weak Hands” Mechanism
TDH’s developers added a ruthless twist: sell your tokens too early, and your wallet gets hit with a “DEPORT” notice—a meme-filled PDF of Homan lecturing you about “diamond hands” while your remaining tokens are burned. It’s the crypto equivalent of getting sent to meme jail.

Meme Campaigns That Border on Chaos
The community hosts weekly contests like “Design Homan’s Next Executive Order” (winners include “Ban Paper Hands from the Moon Mission” and “Build the Wall Street Bets”).

In the chaotic universe of cryptocurrency, where Pepe coins cats and Dogecoin shibes bark for attention, a new memecoin has stormed onto the scene with a satirical edge: Thomas Douglas Homan (TDH). Inspired by the infamous “DEPORT master” and his no-nonsense reputation, this token isn’t just another joke—it’s a turbocharged meme machine for the crypto anarchist who loves dark humor and bureaucratic absurdity.

Who Is Thomas Douglas Homan?

Thomas Douglas Homan, the namesake of this gloriously unhinged token, is a real-life figure best known for his tough-on-immigration rhetoric as a former ICE official. But in the meme-ified crypto realm, $HOMAN reimagines him as a cartoonish anti-hero: a suit-wearing, coffee-chugging bureaucrat who “gets things done”… even if that means deporting weak-handed crypto traders to “FUD Island.” The coin’s mascot—a stern-faced caricature holding a “DEPORT” stamp in one hand and a “To the Moon!” rocket in the other—perfectly captures its mission: mixing political satire with crypto’s lawless spirit.

Had a red flag as went for an informal coffee catchup after second interview where it had been all smiles etc and he got frustrated with me at the coffee catchup when he was talking to me about my current pay and bonus structure. Ignored this red flag and pushed it aside. 

Some of the things he has done I havent heard of in my 20 yr career. 

- tell me and the other new hire to never get up from your desk and leave your laptop unlocked. 

- tell me to never attend any meeting with him with greater than three tabs open

- first few days he wanted something and was showing me over Teams with my shared screen and starts going “cmon mateeeeeeeeeeeee” when I didnt know what menu to click on in this new program its the first time ive seen it

The things he does is:

-constantly talk about himself. Like non stop if he gets the chance

-take over all the meetings, even other peoples meetings

-when his boss is WFH, he uses his office to work and shuts the door

-asks how the weekend is and starts walking off after I say a couple of words. Not interested at all.

-critisises others at work to me

-said my work is poor

-have done a couple of decent tasks in the short time ive been at this workplace but said they have taken too long to do. (Theyve taken too long to do as he keeps changing his mind on things requiring rework and doesnt let me attend meetings and give me any feedback from the meetings so I can complete the work.)

-goes out with others for lunch. Hasnt invited me once. See him say come back from lunch in the distance and wave hi and get nothing back from his end

-checks teams and says it comes up as away everytime he checks in on me. “Its been on away for weeks”.  Like wtf are you talking about.

-dislikes the font I use and colours

-in a teams meeting about week 2, i receive a message from him saying “why aren’t you in this meeting?!’, I message him back saying “i am”, messages me back “oh ok I can see you now, all good”.

-its hot desking and the next row to ours backs onto a nice huge window. Says why do I sit in that row of seats and not where the rest of the team is. Its literally 2 metres away from where the one other person in the team sits. Plus boss is always in the other bosses office with the door closed anyway.

-Fabricates things and tells me others have been saying you havent been supporting them, you’re too quiet. Im like what do you mean. Everyone ive been talking to seems to think I am a good support, I talk to the stakeholders heaps. Call this guy, call that guy, see what he says. Then boss kinda just grunts.


I feel anxious, think about leaving all the time, worried every time I get an email that its from him. Never had this before.

He broke up with me and went no contact a day after. a couple months ago a girl is telling me to stop texting him and leave him alone (hadn’t texted him in weeks). recently, someone threw coffee at my current partners car as well as another woman has texted me telling me my ex wants his property back (i dont have any of his property as i sold it months ago after i couldnt contact him to return them). I’ve been feeling so much better and it still feels like i wont ever get over this as every couple months he makes his existence known. My anxiety has gone from basically non existent to me shaking close to getting sick. It’s probably important to mention that he was physically abusive and does genuinely scare me.

Recently turned 27, thought I might try this again! 

Looking for a man preferably older than me, or if we vibe then my age but no one younger please! 

I'm based in London (West specifically but can easily travel around the place) and I don't drive. I work a busy and stressful job so I definitely need to let out some steam and find someone who is also in need of a genuine connection and good vibes. 

I'm white with a soothing and cute voice and a cute face to match. Body wise I would describe myself as average height and with a chubby/curvy build. My personality at first can be shy and introverted but when I meet the right person my personality really shines through and I'm such good fun.

I enjoy good company and my friends would describe as someone with a cat like personality, make of that what you will! 

I'm one hell of a cinophile and adore being indoors snuggling with my cat in the warmth, especially during the colder seasons. Ideally I'd like to snuggle with the cat on one side and a nice man on the other. That would be idyllic. 

I'm a big snob when it comes to coffee, cheese and sweet treats but outside of that, I'm into gaming, anime and a lot more. 

As for a relationship dynamic I'm old school and love it when a man takes charge and is in control of things. It may be odd but I've always loved a more traditional relationship and I like a man being a man in more ways than one!

I am very affectionate and love being spoiled with attention but I need time to open up to the right person! However for the right person I would make you so happy!

I'd like to find someone I can connect with for the purpose of a long term relationship. So I'm not interested in hookups or ONS. Any messages suggesting this will be deleted and blocked.

I'm more than happy to send photos if we have good connection via reddit chat and then share phone numbers to continue chatting over whatsapp. But please... I don't want to play message tennis forever. I want to meet people, not just text! I am a massive yapper and would love to meet someone who enjoys to talk and prefers voice messages and calls over text!

Yesterday I really struggled with low mood, it felt like my life is utterly pointless and meaningless. I felt sucked into the global darkness that seems to be prevailing, it genuinely feels to me like humanity is on a knife's edge and we can tip into self-destruction at any point... 

This morning I had a different and very profound insight. The solution to all of this is just... Let them. Let them have their wars and their hatred. Let them do their things with their AI and their weapons. Let them stir up the anger and the fears, and let them dominate or do whatever crazy thing is on their mind next. I have no influence over the actions of those few crazy people on top.

Instead, let me lead a quiet, simple, ordinary life, with ordinary joys. Let me feed the birds. Let me enjoy my first sip of coffee every day. Let me notice when my mind gets still. Let me be delighted when the sun lights up the trees or when I see the sea.

What if the world is one big energy balancing game and every action is meaningful, even if it is in apparent isolation? What if we are all contributing towards this balance, through our every day actions, thoughts and feelings? What if all the millions of little moments of joy in everybody's lives are counterbalancing the fear and hatred that is playing out? What if my experience of wonder and delight at nature's beauty when I go for a walk, has an effect on this global balance - how could it not?

I just know this to be true! 

It is our challenge during this lifetime to feel and see the darkness, and to turn consciously towards the light, over and over again. To keep dusting ourselves off and to keep re-connecting with the love that connects all things. 

We don't have to live spiritual lives, to meditate and to be righteous in everything - all we need to do is find as many ways as we can to feel joy and appreciation, because the world needs this energy right now.

It all has an emotional or mental component to it that aim to give a quick fix for the current state of being. This instant dulling or stimulation of our current state is not a sustainable way to live and reduces our sensitivity to be engaged with life in general. So instead of thinking of quiting this and that, think about how more sensitive and aware of your body and your surroundings when you're not dependent on external fixes, don't make anything a crutch and aim to be more empowered with independence everyday. When you are in control you are empowered, when you're seeking comfort in substances that give immediate temporary fixes to your body and being, you're enslaved.

So don't aim to quit, aim to be empowered in every aspect of your life, it doesn't matter if the crutch is smoking or anything else. The goal is to be in tune with yourself and regulate your wellbeing without being dependent on temporary fixes.

I started my DN life in October, and have been moving around a lot... it's been a busy few months living spending time in Valencia, Barcelona, and a Coliving in the Mountains, as well as a business trip in Los Angeles. I'm ready to chill tf out for a while, so I'm off to Albania in a few days, having booked my first 1-month+ Airbnb in Sarandë. 

Anyone currently DNing in Sarandë? Would be great to have a meetup, go for some hikes, or simply got for a coffee if the weather sucks. I have a car here, so road trips are on the cards!

He firstly got shocked, eyes wide open and then smiled and chuckled and suggested to do it right away. I told him I am busy and we should do it tomorrow. We decided after class, but i thought it was after a different class than what he had in mind, and we could not do it (though he had smiled at me when i got to the gym). I will ask him out again.

1idlp96,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1idlp96/left_behind/,Left Behind,"It’s not the broken windows or the crumbling walls. 

It’s not the rusted vehicles with their skeletal drivers forever stuck in traffic.

No, it’s the silence. 

What were once bustling sidewalks—lively restaurants and bars—playgrounds filled with screaming children.

All gone quiet. 

All gone still. 

You can’t really fathom the background din constantly humming through a city until it’s no longer there. An ever-present cacophony that you become deaf to over the years—your ears so attuned to the steady vibrations of the lives of strangers that you don’t even notice it. 

Until it’s gone. 

That’s the worst part of being the only one left—the all-encompassing quiet. 

Well, at least it is now. 

At first, it was the smell. 

Rot.

Rancid… Fetid…

Millions of bodies, baking in the relentless, summer sun. 

It was inescapable. 

For months, I breathed air poisoned with the scent of melting flesh and leaking organs, until all that remained were bones and teeth.

Every hour, I begged for it to dissipate—I begged for one fresh, untainted gasp of air. 

But now, absent its nauseating putrescence, I find that some days, I miss it. 

Some days, I’d welcome the vomit-inducing odor.

Because it was my last link to the rest of humanity. 

Because the pure, clean breeze drifting through my window serves merely as a reminder that I’m alone. 

That I’m one. 

And I have no idea why. 

All I do know, is that at 8am on an average Tuesday in July, everyone else died. 

Everyone. 

There were no signs, or warnings. No message from “The Almighty” declaring the age of humanity ended. 

I was just sitting at my desk when every single person in my office simply dropped dead. 

Stan was pouring a cup of coffee, Erin was telling Megan about her dance class, Mark was on his way to the copier—and then, as if someone flipped a switch, all of them, simultaneously, collapsed around me. 

Panicking, I checked their vitals and I shouted for help, but no one responded. 

I imagined there must be a toxin spreading through the office, and fled outside while dialing for emergency services. 

Yet, no one answered the line. 

And, exiting the building, I was met with a scene of utter chaos. 

Crashed vehicles—fires—sparking, severed electrical lines. 

And bodies. 

So. Many. Bodies. 

Overhead, a plane screamed, far too low, above the rooftops.

I didn’t know then, that death had taken them all. 

I didn’t know then, that I was the only one left behind. 

My family, my friends—people I hated—people I never met. 

All gone. 

I’ve spent countless hours poring over the whys and hows of my survival over every other person in this city, and I have one leading theory. 

I think that maybe it has something to do with the titanium plate in my skull. 

I think that maybe, everyone else actually was “switched off.” 

Because sometimes, at night, I see lights in the sky. 

Hovering above the skyscrapers.

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush. Now go forth and conquer that blank page! (And maybe wear a lampshade for good luck.)",1,1738239345.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

I probably only bought this printer because I thought it would make me look like a \~creative\~ person, but it's actually getting way more use than I imagined.

Here's my thoughts on it.

# First Impressions

Im not exactly the scrapbook type. More like the let’s let these memories rot in iCloud forever type. Do I really need to print photos in 2025? Probably not. But do I want to? 

Absolutely. 

It’s like buying a waffle maker. you don’t need it, but once you have it, you’re committed to a lifetime of waffles. Or, in this case, glossy 4x6 photos of your dog wearing sunglasses.

# My Favorite Features

**Print and charge functionality.** The dock doubles as a phone charger, which is either genius or completely unnecessary, depending on how often you forget to charge your phone. (For me, it’s genius.) 

**4PASS technology.** The printer uses a four-layer color process with a laminating finish, making the photos fingerprint-proof and water-resistant. It basically means my toddler can drool on them, and they’ll still look good.

**Border vs borderless photos.** You can choose between borderless photos for a sleek, modern look or bordered photos if you want to scribble notes like it’s 2005. Personally, I went with borderless because I’m fancy like that.

**Augmented reality app.** The Kodak Photo Printer app lets you add filters, frames, and even AR effects to your photos. It’s like Instagram, but with more commitment because you can’t just delete the photo if it looks bad.

**Low photo cost.** Kodak claims this is the most affordable way to print photos at home. And honestly, it’s cheaper than driving to Walgreens and dealing with their self-service kiosk, which is basically a test of my patience.

**Bluetooth connectivity.** The printer connects to your phone via Bluetooth, which is great unless your Bluetooth is as unreliable as my Wi-Fi. (Make sure your phone is fully charged before pairing, or you’ll be stuck in a loop of frustration.)

# Pros

* **Convenience.** Printing photos at home is actually really neat. No more waiting in line at the store, love it.

* **Photo quality.** The 4PASS technology delivers crisp, vibrant photos that look like they came from a professional lab. My dog has never looked better.

* **Durability.** The water-resistant, fingerprint-proof finish means your photos can survive spills, sticky fingers, and even the occasional coffee mishap or something.

* **App features.** The Kodak app is fun to use. The AR effects are a nice touch, and the filters are less cringe than some of the ones on Instagram.

* **Pretty small.** The printer is small enough to fit on a desk or shelf without taking up too much space. It’s also lightweight, so you can move it around easily.

# Cons

* **Docking connector.** The dock only charges your phone, it doesn’t transfer data. This kinda sucks if i'm honest.

* **Software issues.** The app can be glitchy, especially on Android. It also asks for way too many permissions, which is annoying.

* **Noise.** The printer is a bit louder than I expected. It’s not unbearable, but it’s definitely not whisper-quiet.

# Final Thoughts

I'd say it's great for anyone who loves printing photos but hates leaving the house. It’s also great for people who are constantly running out of phone battery (hi, it’s me). However, if you’re looking for a professional-grade printer or someone who hates dealing with apps, this might not be for you.

Overall, I’d say it’s worth the investment if you’re into tangible memories and convenience. Just don’t expect it to solve all your life problems, unless your only problem is a lack of glossy dog photos.

1idll5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1idll5r/is_it_too_much_of_caffeine/,Is it too much of caffeine?,"Hello! 

I’ve had moka pot for about 5 years and I usually had 4 cups size (240 ml or 8.11 ounces) and what do I usually do is pour it all into a cup that has 350ml or 11.83 oz and fill it up with around 70ml or 2.37 oz of milk or water (+-10ml or 0.34 oz) and I usually have 2 of those daily, sometimes 3 and that’s my maximum. 

Lately I’ve been thinking how much of caffeine I am actually drinking daily and I’ve stumbled over a discussion that one cup has around 70mg of caffeine, which makes it 240 per my serving? 

This got me asking myself whether I am drinking too much of coffee and have more than recommended dose of 400mg coffee. 

Am I really drinking too much of caffeine? Or does the milk or water keep it under the recommended dose somehow?

Please note I don't want give my identity or location. 

I recently visited the open space at my local library and wanted to share some honest feedback, especially for those considering sending vulnerable adults or individuals with specific needs.

1. Limited Support for Vulnerable Adults:
While the open space is intended to be a welcoming environment, there isn’t much support for those who might need it. If you’re thinking about sending someone with specific needs, consider whether this space provides the right level of care and attention.

2. Lack of Trained Staff:
The staff are generally friendly, but there doesn’t seem to be enough trained personnel to fully support vulnerable individuals. This can leave those who require more structured support feeling somewhat neglected or unsure of where to turn for help.

3. Silence Can Be Overwhelming:
The space is often too quiet, which can worsen anxiety for some individuals. Without any background noise or even the typical hustle and bustle of a coffee shop, it can feel isolating and uncomfortable. The silence, combined with sometimes meaningless conversations between participants, can leave people feeling disconnected or restless.

4. Toxic Positivity and Lack of Room for Authenticity:
There’s a strong presence of toxic positivity in this space, where there seems to be an expectation to always remain upbeat or avoid expressing negative feelings. It can feel like your frustrations or struggles are dismissed, and you’re treated more like a “service user” than a person with real emotions. It becomes difficult to voice frustration or express how you truly feel without feeling shut down.

5. Colouring Pictures Can Feel Patronising:
One of the activities offered is colouring pictures, which some may find patronising or demoralising. It doesn’t always feel like an appropriate or meaningful use of time, especially for individuals who may need more intellectually stimulating or engaging activities to feel valued and productive.

6. Limited Activities or Resources for Engagement:
The space doesn’t offer much in terms of meaningful activities or resources. A lot of time is spent colouring, which many individuals might not find helpful or engaging. It can feel like you’re just sitting there with little to do, which may not be suitable for someone who needs more structure or something more stimulating.

7. A Shift Away from the “Recovery Mindset”:
There’s a constant focus on “recovery” or “distraction”, which can feel limiting. People may benefit from just being able to have a conversation about things like TV shows, music, or even other interests that aren’t centred around “healing”. If there was more room for casual, everyday discussions or even more engaging activities like group discussions around shared interests, it could make the space feel more welcoming and less about feeling constantly “in recovery”.

8. Less of a Hospital Waiting Room, More Natural:
The environment often feels like a hospital waiting room, which can be off-putting for those already feeling anxious or stressed. It would benefit from a more natural, relaxed atmosphere where people are seen as individuals with feelings, not as patients or service users. A setting that feels more like a community space rather than a clinical environment would likely create a more positive experience.

9. Improve Resources and Activities:
Investing in better quality stationery and more engaging materials could significantly improve engagement. Providing activities that go beyond colouring books—such as games, art supplies, or even simple conversation starters—could help individuals feel more connected and invested in the space.

10. Improve the Coffee Facilities:
A simple addition like improving the coffee facilities could go a long way. Having a better variety of drinks, along with a comfortable place to enjoy them, could help make the environment feel more welcoming and less clinical. This would also create a more relaxed atmosphere where people can take a break, have a conversation, or just enjoy a cup of coffee in peace.

11. Inconsistent Availability:
At times, the space isn’t readily available or may be difficult to access, so it’s worth checking beforehand to see if it will be open when you need it.

12. Double standards 
If you are person struggling with mental health you are often treated as if you are lowest clas citizen of the world to compared to those with learning disability challenges. There is essentially one rule for them and one rule for you. As the people tht go there often don't take responsibility and blame their ""autism"" ""I have learning disabilities""

I am not trying to be offensive to this community or discriminatory but it's not fair we have rule they have another.

At times, the space can feel as if double standards are being committed 
Overall, while the open space might work for some, I’d recommend considering whether it’s the right fit for individuals who may need more structured support, meaningful activities, or a more engaging environment. For those who struggle with anxiety or need something more than just quiet space, there may be better alternatives to explore.

And a slow demise

Uber eats

Delivered to your death bed

Coffee to go

Plastic lined chalice 

Forever chemicals

Leeching

And E-coli

Money made

Under hand

Over fist

We feed the beast

Because we need the beast

And their scraps

Will do us nicely

Barely comfortable

But worlds happier

Than the poor fuckers presented to us

The grass on the other side

Is dead and yellow

One Schadenfreude please

And fries on the side

Of course to go
