Techniques and Tools for Mastering Wood Burning Art
---------------------------------------------------

Wood burning art, also known as pyrography, offers a unique combination of creativity and craftsmanship. To truly master this art form, understanding the techniques and tools involved is essential. Whether you are a beginner or looking to refine your skills, exploring various methods and equipment can elevate your work to stunning levels.

### Understanding the Basics of Wood Burning Art

Before diving into the advanced methods, it‚Äôs crucial to grasp the fundamentals of wood burning. This technique involves using a heated tool to create designs on wood surfaces. The intensity of heat determines how dark the lines and shapes appear, giving you a wide range of effects. Taking the time to practice these basics will help provide a solid foundation for your wood burning journey.

### Essential Tools for Wood Burning

Investing in quality tools is vital for achieving impressive results in wood burning. Here is a list of essential tools you should consider:

- **Wood Burning Pen:** The primary tool you‚Äôll use, available in various styles, including fixed-temperature and adjustable-temperature pens.
- **Wood Types:** Choose the right type of wood, such as basswood or birch plywood, which burn well and provide a smooth surface for detailed work.
- **Practice Boards:** Use scrap wood to practice different techniques before working on your final pieces.
- **Stencils and Patterns:** Freestyle designs can be daunting; using stencils can help guide your burning process.
- **Brushes and Finishing Tools:** After burning, brushes can help clean the wood surface, while sanding blocks can smooth edges and surfaces.

### Basic Wood Burning Techniques

Once you have your tools ready, it‚Äôs important to practice some basic techniques. Start with these foundational methods:

- **Shading:** To create depth in your designs, practice the shading technique. Use lighter pressure for softer effects and more pressure for darker tones.
- **Line Work:** Understand different line variations, including straight, curved, and zigzag lines. Mixing these can add texture and interest to your artwork.
- **Dots:** Adding dots can enhance illustrations, providing a stippled effect that can bring your work to life.
- **Background Patterns:** Experiment with filling in larger areas using repetitive patterns or textures to provide contrast against the main design.

### Advanced Techniques for Creative Expression

As you become more comfortable with wood burning, try incorporating advanced techniques into your art. Here are a few to consider:

Check out the blog for more information https://pyrographyhaven.com/10-stunning-decorative-wood-burning-ideas-for-home-decor/  
  
- **Layering:** Build complexity by layering designs. Start with lighter colors and gradually add darker shades for a richer look.
- **Coloring:** Combine wood burning with colored pencils or paints for a vibrant finished product. Always seal your work afterward to protect it.
- **Three-Dimensional Effects:** Create the illusion of depth through clever use of shading and burn depths. This technique can make elements appear to pop off the surface.
- **Mixed Media:** Incorporate other materials, like metal or fabric, into your wood-burning artwork for added dimension. This can turn a simple piece into a stunning masterpiece.

### Safety Tips When Wood Burning

Safety should never take a backseat while engaging in wood burning art. Here are some important safety precautions:

- **Work in a Ventilated Area:** Ensure you have good airflow to avoid inhaling smoke from burning wood.
- **Use Protective Gear:** Wear safety goggles and use a dust mask to protect yourself from fumes and splinters.
- **Handle Tools Carefully:** Always unplug your wood burner when changing tips or during breaks to avoid accidental burns.

The right tools, techniques, and safety practices will help you master the intricacies of wood burning art. As you continue to practice and explore your creativity, you‚Äôll find a world full of possibilities in transforming simple pieces of wood into mesmerizing works of art. Happy burning!

### Conclusion

Bringing decorative wood burning into your home d√©cor is a fantastic way to infuse creativity and warmth into your living space. The unique designs you can create, ranging from intricate patterns to personalized art pieces, serve not only as beautiful d√©cor but also as meaningful expressions of your personality and style.

1h3tl35,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1h3tl35/all_the_lasts/,All The Lasts ,"The last kiss, the last time sleeping in the same bed, the last hug, the last smile shared, the last time bringing you coffee in bed, the last laughs together, last time of making love, The last things we said to each other as partners. On Halloween it made me contemplate all the lasts because it was also first, the first time in years not being in a new  Wes Anderson themed costume together and then it all seemed so distant. I had no idea all the lasts would be lasts and got swept up in realizing I didn‚Äôt savor them for what they were.

Some days I feel more accepting of this process and the decision to go our own ways, others it‚Äôs feels impossible to accept. Some days I think about you less, and others the pain of missing you is unbearable. I wonder if you go thru the same emotions of anger, regret, and sadness before realizing you can‚Äôt stay in those feelings without feeling longing too. I wonder if you also try to convince yourself too that none of this was real, that you never really knew me, that it was all a lie, that you‚Äôre better off without just to cope with my absence, even if only for a moment to feel relief. 

Some nights I‚Äôm so restless dreaming about you. And hating that the other half of the bed is cold and empty and I wonder if you still dream about me and miss my warmth in the bed. 

Some days I wonder if you too have to resist the urge to text me that you still love me thru it all. That you‚Äôd choose me again if we could find a road to healthy. Because Some days I daydream about you texting to tell me to come over so you can kiss me like it was the first time all over again. I try to deny it but sometimes I secretly hope that you‚Äôll randomly drive by because you just wanted to embrace me again. 

I wonder if you have a hard time envisioning a future without me like I do without you because I find myself wondering if maybe down the road our paths will cross again and  if we‚Äôd smile at each other and create something beautiful, honest and true from scratch‚Ä¶and I wonder if you ever have those thoughts too 

Because‚Ä¶

 I‚Äôm missing our touches, our kisses, cuddling in bed/on the couch, taking gummies and making love, holding your hand, and rubbing your shoulders, back, feet, hands. 

God, I just miss touching your face and scratching your head while you lay between me, I miss what your lips feel like against mine, what your naked skin felt like against mine, I miss the passion, I miss the feeling of comfort in you staring at me bare and only see my beauty. I miss laying eyes on you and still having my breath taken away. 

I miss your stares with a mischievous smiles, and wondering what‚Äôs running thru your head, the way you‚Äôd randomly walk up behind me and touch my back, rub my shoulders or grab my butt. I miss the all those small soft moments and touches we shared and the way my heart fluttered  in those moments. 

I miss stupid and silly laughs with you. I miss your advice and not being able to ask you questions, I miss coffee fueled debates on solving all the problems in the world, i miss your discover weekly and our shared playlist, I miss the feeling when we realized like when we loved the same things like snickers and rocky road ice cream, i miss random moments when we‚Äôd be thinking about doing the same thing or craving the same food and it felt right, i miss creating new traditions with you(I‚Äôll never grab sunflower seeds on the way to the outdoors and not think of you or eat Chinese take out on Christmas Day and remember the first Christmas together over looking the pacific and realizing how in love i was with you in those quiet moments). I miss sharing a zest for life with you. I miss adventures and dreaming of the bucket list travels and cabins in the woods and living somewhere new one day, and being excited about envisioning be old and wrinkled with you. 

I miss knowing that we were but two pieces that could‚Äôve fit together so perfectly. 

I just miss you. I miss you even when I try to convince myself that I don‚Äôt. And I just regret not appreciating all of the small things and feelings along the way enough to know how rare all of that was. 

And I know I‚Äôm not supposed to tell you these things, I‚Äôm supposed to detach, be strong and move on without showing vulnerability. I know I‚Äôm not supposed to be too much or overwhelm you with emotion, but thats feels so dis genuine to who I am. Because I‚Äôd be lying if I pretended the magnitude of the loss isn‚Äôt there and theres only one person that‚Äôs the other half that made all the above true who can truly understand it. 

I do enviously wonder how you keep it together and have so much self control because most days it feels like I have to try so hard to not cry, to ask if you‚Äôre okay, to want to comfort you or share random things with you. It takes so much to try to not be in your life and I‚Äôm jealous it seems easier for you. 

They say I‚Äôm supposed to accept the regret, accept the present as it is and release the past. I‚Äôm supposed to take comfort in my own healing and trust when people say going thru this and doing the work will leave me better off for my next relationship, but I can‚Äôt even fathom wanting a relationship with anyone but the man who‚Äôs seen me at my worst, who loved me thru pain. I just don‚Äôt care to find love again because I know underneath the brokeness of who we were as people was real love and I can hold onto that. 

I‚Äôm trying to let a little more go everyday, to feel the feelings and not sit with them for too long, to be honest with myself about where I‚Äôm at and be ok with where you‚Äôre at and get thru this with dignity, self respect and kindness without embarrassing myself by being the heartbroken ex gf who still feels too much some days. 

So instead I just I write it out in my notes and debate whether to share it. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôd ever read it thru, but maybe one day you‚Äôll want to.

I have finally weighed myself couple of weeks ago and had to face the fact that I got to the 2nd degree obesity. I was terrified because my life consists of huge weight swings and it always ends on the highest weight of my entire life.

Now, on November 12, I started doing low impact walking/dancing cardio workouts. I‚Äôm extremely proud of myself because I‚Äôm a depressed couch potato. According to my scale I lost 2,5 kg (5 lbs) although I wasn‚Äôt counting calories and only cut back on dining out (ramen and korean fried chicken for example).

But my biggest problem is EMOTIONAL EATING and late night eating. Recently I‚Äôve been going through some harder times because 9 months ago I had a nose job and now I‚Äôve been trying to face the fact it didn‚Äôt go as planned. So I drink coffee with milk and eat sugar free cookies in the middle of the day. But the late night eating is probably even worse. Right before going to bed I always develop fear that I‚Äôll get hungry before I fall asleep and sometimes I start eating before I even feel hunter just to avoid it because I could never fall asleep being hungry. Sometimes I just start being hungry and try to stop myself from going to the fridge but I always go and ear more than I need and there is no chance to digest it before falling asleep. The sometimes I wake up feeling hangover.

I worked at a check processing place, and every morning I would have a cup of coffee and a package of cookies - either Famous Amos or a little 6-pack of Oreos.  Breakfast of champions.  One morning, one of my coworkers gave me a package of Oreos, since she‚Äôd bought one too many from the vending machine.

Great, thanks!  I opened it up, and twisted the cookies apart as normal.  She gave me the MOST stunned and disgusted look.  ‚ÄúWHAT are you DOING???‚Äù

I'm 34f and I'm married to 38m. We've been married for less than a year and I really love my husband. We are generally happy in our relationship, however, my husband has a 12 year old daughter who just can't stand me.
I don't know how else to explain it but she wants me to leave and she's doing everything to make it happen.
Ever since we started dating and I met his daughter she never liked me. I thought it was idk maybe because I'm dating her dad and she's sad her parents divorced but it has gotten worse. Before we got married and we weren't living together, I wasn't around her really, I mean I did meet her and occasionally saw her and she was rude to me every time. Since we moved in together and she's been spending more time at our house than her mom's, she started being more rude and straight up evil. 
She started being more openly rude to me but not around her dad, she's just rude to me when he's not around. 
She wants to make it seem like I'm being mean to her like for example, I was working on a really important paper for my job and as I was writing last bit, I left my laptop on table and went to toilet and when I came back the whole document was gone. It was deleted from my profile on Microsoft word and even from computer memory. Even the recycle bin was empty which means someone had to completely delete it. 
Me and her were the only people inside the house and her dad was outside. I asked her not did she do it, but why did she do it because she was the only one in the house and she started yelling so that her dad would hear and come back in. She said how I'm always accusing her of something and straight up lied. 
Her dad actually told her she cant be doing that and she went back to her room.
I still lost my paper though.
That was just one of the numerous things she did, for example, she locked me out on balcony, she put my phone in water but it survived, she hides my stuff like my car keys or things I bring with me when I have to leave the house in a rush just to make me mad. It's absurd honestly, most of the things are just plain annoying and not harmful but the thing that definitely made me decide to leave and divorce from her dad is when she made coffee for him and and me, which is not something she really does, at least not for me. But she made me a cup of coffee and I was confused why she was being nice. Thankfully I jokingly thought ""it must be poisoned"" and stired the coffee and found a big piece of glass inside. I showed it to my husband and he was absolutely mad and yelled at her but I don't think that's enough for me to stay. I don't feel safe anymore, like if I didn't stir that coffee I would probably end up cutting my throat with glass or swallowimg it. It's not just a harmless prank it was really fucked up and serious this time. 
I already told my husband I can't stay in the same house with her because she obviously wants me gone. 
I simply don't want to stay and I know I cant make him like leave his daughter or whatever. I think this is the only solution because I'm not going to risk her doing something more and actually hurting me this time. ",3,1733020952.0,AITAH,11,0.8,False
1h3t7lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/1h3t7lg/how_nano_xno_could_go_viral_without_inflation/,"How Nano ($XNO) Could Go Viral Without Inflation, Mining, or Fees","Nano is unique in the crypto space because it doesn‚Äôt rely on inflation, mining rewards, or transaction fees. While these features make it eco-friendly and scalable, they also mean Nano lacks some of the game theory mechanics other cryptos use to attract attention and incentize holding.

But what if we could help nano gain attention by rewarding its community in innovative ways? 

Here are a few ideas to spark discussion:
	
1.	Business Profit-Sharing for Nano Holders

Imagine if a business (centralized or decentralized) donated a portion of its profits to Nano holders with 133+ XNO in their wallets. It could act like a loyalty reward system, tying Nano adoption to real-world business success. For example, a business generating revenue in Nano could commit to distributing 5% of its profits to eligible wallets every quarter. This would incentivize people to hold Nano and promote businesses accepting it.
	
2.	Decentralized Donation Redistribution

What if we had a Nano donation address where anyone could contribute? The funds collected would then be automatically distributed among all Nano wallets holding 133+ XNO. This could be used for community-building efforts, charitable causes, or simply as a way to reward long-term holders. By making donations transparent and automated, we could foster a sense of collaboration and shared purpose within the Nano community.
	
3.	Crowdfunding Incentives

Projects using Nano for crowdfunding could reward supporters who also hold 133+ XNO. For example, early backers could receive a small share of future revenues or even bonus Nano for their support. This would strengthen Nano‚Äôs use case in the crowdfunding space and encourage community members to participate in building new projects.
	

4.	Viral ‚ÄúNano Giveback‚Äù Campaigns

Nano could gain attention through community-driven donation campaigns. Here‚Äôs how it could work: A group donates Nano to a charity or cause. In return, wallets holding 133+ XNO get a small reward for amplifying the effort. This ties generosity to rewards and encourages social sharing, helping spread Nano‚Äôs value proposition to a wider audience.
	
5.	Decentralized Loyalty Programs

Businesses accepting Nano could create loyalty programs where customers earn rewards for using Nano in transactions. A portion of these rewards could also be shared with holders of 133+ XNO, incentivizing both spending and holding. For example, a coffee shop accepting Nano could offer discounts to users while also giving small rewards to Nano holders, fostering a circular economy.

Why 133 XNO?

Setting a threshold ensures that rewards go to committed holders rather than spammers or inactive wallets. It also encourages more people to accumulate and hold Nano, further strengthening the network and community engagement.

Let‚Äôs Brainstorm Together

These are just a few ideas to get the ball rolling. The goal is to take advantage of Nano‚Äôs eco-friendly, fee-less, and instant transaction model to drive adoption and build a thriving community.

What do you think? Are there other creative ways Nano could gain adoption and reward its holders? Let‚Äôs discuss!

1h3t6o6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stepmom/comments/1h3t6o6/fil_hit_my_bs_because_he_needs_to_stop_bullying_sd/,"FIL hit my BS because he ""needs to stop bullying SD""","Tldr; FIL hit my BS on the leg hard enough for us to hear because he grabbed SD's hair (they act like siblings and getting physical with one another on occasion is nothing new and we are working on it but they're both 3).

For context, SO and I have lived together for a year. We treat both kids as our own 100% of the time and the kids fight and argue like siblings, SD even introduces BS as her ""bubby"". They are both equally guilty of it, but SD makes it more known when BS does it. She's a very whiney kid and will sometimes run up to us crying and tattling on BS for just existing on the other side of the room. We practice authoritative parenting and do not hit our kids except for an emergency smacking a hand away from a dangerous object (orrrr the time I reflexively punched BS because he tried to hand me a spider lol). SO and I are not married but I'll be referring to his parents as MIL and FIL for simplicity.

I haven't been on friendly terms with my stepdad for over a year and just started talking to him again after giving him major cold shoulder for almost two months (he hates my child and I simply because he's a whiney man child that my mom needs to leave - I'm not even a bad step daughter, I'm 25 and live my own life and just spend time with my mom 1-2 times a month). On Thanksgiving, after SO's parent left (who I invited and cooked for), he shoved my BS. I immediately went off on him and removed everyone from that situation. So, I was already sensitive and heated from this situation as it was just two days ago.

SD had spent the night with MIL. We picked her up, took both kids (3) to a Bluey meet and greet in MIL's town before returning as SD's BM was picking her up later that day from MIL (we have 50/50 of SD but 60% of the time so SO often allows SD to spend time with M/FIL).

They had been bickering and being siblings for an hour. BS had been a bit worse today and had been corrected once over sharing. However, SD had been bad about it too as she screamed at BS and cried because he grabbed HIS cup of ""kid coffee"", which she knew was his cup (just to put into perspective how much she tattles and whines about him, he was on the other side of the room the other day watching TV and reached for HIS cat to pet her and SD came in the kitchen screaming and sobbing because she wanted her). Just so we're all aware that they're both like this and neither are little angels.

M/FIL absolutely favor SD. I understand, that their bio grandkid, but they're sometimes very unfair with their treatment of BS. They show this pretty well, ever since BS went through a biting phase earlier this year. We didn't have any custody at the time and MIL tried to get SO to kick us out as BM was keeping SD from SO if BS was there (he wasn't even 3 at the time and it got corrected). We now have 50/50 custody and SD 60% of the time. I was in the middle of texting my sister to vent about how, whenever we were over there, it felt like me against them about my BS vs SD as they never correct SD but constantly correct BS. Before this, MIL even raised her voice at BS for getting too close to the Christmas tree, despite him not knowing better, when she had correct SD very gently before then (which BS was in the bathroom for).

They were each playing with a climbing frame. They were on top and under it. First, it was that BS ""shoved"" SD out of it. He did not, she was about to climb under it when he climbed under first. He was told to wait his turn and slow down as an initial warning. Next, BS was laying under it by himself when SD tried to flip it over because she was mad about the previous incident. BS grabbed her hair through the bars. Just grabbed. Didn't pull, just held onto it but SD started to cry (rightfully so this time). BS let go as soon as SO said ""BS! Let go of SD's hair."" He would've gone to time out for this had I had the chance. Instead, FIL leaned down and smacked him on the leg. I immediately stood, grabbed my BS and left the house. I heard SO start yelling at FIL and FIL said, ""BS needs to stop bullying her!"", to which SO replied that SD does the SAME stuff to BS, he just never sees it. MIL kept trying to get SO to sit down and basically get over it. I got BS in the car and returned to grab his shoes. I was already sensitive from my step dad pushing my son and I burst, I yelled at him (which is very much like me as I'm confrontational but I'm also quiet and pretty easy going so I'm sure it was a surprise to M/FIL). 

Now, I'm not sure what to do. I've never been more than cordial with SO's family as I'm shy, they're a bit older, and over BS's biting phase and I don't think they ever forgave that. I don't think I want to go over there anymore but I also want a healthy relationship with my MIL as I plan on marrying this man one day and we want an ours baby as well.

SO texted FIL after we got home, saying, ""What made you think it was okay to hit one of my kids?"". FIL tried to apologize, however, this is not the first time he's ""tapped"" (FIL's words) one of our kids, though he's been gentler and more discrete and I never said anything because it was never BS and SO didn't say anything. I think he only apologized because MIL got mad at him once SO said that he wouldn't be going over there anymore if FIL was there (FIL is not SO's BD). I don't think it's my place to correct his parents, even if I don't agree with it (that is, until it comes to my son getting hurt).

I am just so sick of the favoritism. I know it's their bio but you could stop making it so obvious? My mom doesn't see SD much but, even though she favors BS, she treats them the same when they're around. My mom mildly dislikes SD (and my entire family, actually - even my kid obsessed great granny is driven nuts by her) because she's just awful whiney. Even my sister, who's been babysitting and around kids since she was old enough to microwave ramen noodles and change a diaper has said that she's the whiniest and most difficult kid to be around that she's ever met. They don't see what SD is actually like though. SO does but his parents don't. Not that BS is perfect, he's far from it. He can be aggressive and bossy, he's very loud and demanding. He's just a high energy, conquer the world kid.",0,1733020804.0,Stepmom,0,0.33,False

This past month I‚Äôve slowly been getting pictures of memories I had somehow forgotten, mostly of some of the more physical abuse I had gone through at her hand, but definitely a lot of mental things as well. I don‚Äôt know where to start, and I‚Äôm sure much more will surface in time. 

I guess I can start with some of the physical incidents that leave me shocked when thinking back to them. The first major incident I can recall was when I was (maybe) 5, and my sister one year younger, woke up early-ish (no earlier than 7 for sure) but before my mother who slept in the next room. Well, to pass time we were giggling and such, nothing major in my eyes for two young girls, but oops! We woke up mom, (I still blank on what happened in between) she came into the room with a roll of duct tape, taped our hands together and taped our mouths shut. I have restricted airways and it is extremely difficult for me to breathe through my nose, but fortunately, my problems weren‚Äôt so bad at such a young age and I had little issues breathing. We were like that about an hour. Maybe 5-6 years later, after a large scary storm (I wasn‚Äôt sleeping and my older sister came to get me to come downstairs. It was before midnight and I think I had run into something making a bit of noise, my mom rushed down the hallway and pinned me to the wall choking me, letting me go after a minute. By this time of my life I was responsible for waking up my younger sister and brother for school so my mother could sleep in (who was unemployed through much of my childhood). (My older sister (2 years older) never had responsibilities towards myself or the other siblings and barely around the house as well, so from a young age age I was very much responsible for my younger siblings as well as the house in many ways) Well, upon waking up my siblings we had to be as quiet as humanly possible, and my mother would wake up at some point while we were in the kitchen usually. We were reprimanded and told not to talk to her until she had a coffee at least‚Ä¶ you couldn‚Äôt even make eye contact with her or say hi/good morning to her or she would become unraveled. The look on her face alone was enough to keep from talking, and at night I wasn‚Äôt allowed to have my radio on (as low as it could possibly go, I could barely hear it) because she couldn‚Äôt sleep, she could hear it through the vents as my room was then below hers. 

My mother loved to dole out spankings, for so many reasons I can‚Äôt even remember. One time, when I was 6, my older friend had convinced me to cross the tracks with her even though I didn‚Äôt want to. We were witnessed and ratted on. When I got home my mother was furious and she chased me around the house, I knew what was coming, I hid under beds and begged my father to not let her get me, but he did. She took her anger out on my butt and grounded me to my room for a month. I was the best behaved child of 4, and was always punished way worse than anyone else. There was one incident where my little brother mentioned being spanked at school. Social services came to the house and we were given family counselling for a while and my mom was told that spanking is not allowed. During most of the sessions my mother flat out made herself the victim in every situation. It was always about her feelings. Some other punishments included going to bed hungry or sitting on your knees in a corner for hours. So I suppose she stopped the physical stuff after that in fear, but the emotional abuse never ended, but I‚Äôll save for another time! ",3,1733020788.0,raisedbynarcissists,17,1.0,False

I figured I‚Äôd hammer out the kinks here so I won‚Äôt have to worry about the logic when programming it unreal/unity. It essentially works like this:

The player has a ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù menu in a similar way an ‚Äúinventory‚Äù works. But instead of items, the notes tab has statements that can be collected. The character can make observations by examining items, people, places, or through dialogue. For example the player can click on John‚Äôs green shirt, which would add a ‚ÄúStatement‚Äù to their ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù menu. Maybe like this:


**Statement Added**
1) John is wearing a green shirt


It‚Äôs collected through dialogue automatically based on the dialogue choices the player makes:


Rebecca- ‚ÄúIm such an idiot, I spilled my coffee‚Äù

**statement added**

2) Rebecca spilled her coffee


The statements would be compiled for the player to go through and would include relevant information, irrelevant information (eg johns green shirt), and red herrings.


‚ÄúStatements‚Äù can then be used to form ‚ÄúThoughts‚Äù. In the same ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù menu, the player can combine two statements with a conjunction to form a thought, which can be combined with evidence, or presented in dialogue (this is where the ‚Äúcrafting‚Äù system comes into play). There will be three drop down menus one for a statment on the left and right and a middle drop down for a list of combining words like ‚Äúbecause, after, so, and, while‚Äù etc.

So something like this:

-NOTES-

Observations 
            1. John wore a green shirt.
            2. Rebecca spilled her coffee.

Thoughts

1 [BECAUSE] 2


Now during dialogue if another character asks why John is wearing a green shirt, the player can present that thought to them.

The point is to create a system that‚Äôs more interactive and requires thinking rather than just pressing buttons to get the answer or handholding the player to it, like many detective games end up being. Ofc it‚Äôll be supplemented with rewards and consequences, but this is the bare bones mechanic.

So from this concept I‚Äôm not sure what the best way to move forward is. I can treat statements like items and have the game add them to players notes ‚Äúinventory‚Äù when conditions are met:


If (Rebecca says ‚ÄúI spilled my coffee‚Äù
    Add ‚ÄúRebecca spilled her coffee‚Äù to notes

;

And just do that for all statements collected. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs efficient though to have that many items. Additionally for the combining mechanic my initial thought was just to use a nesting conditional.


So my inquiry boils down to, how can I work to make this doable? Are there any problems with my thought process? Anything to help it go smoother? I‚Äôm not a great programmer and I have severe brain fog atm so anything helps lol

We had turkey, chicken kebabs for thanksgiving, my parents didn't eat that because they don't eat meat. So I felt an extra incentive to accommodate them. My wife has no dietary restrictions and typically prefers the traditional egg-based version. My wife usually likes my French toast.

This morning, I made French toast with brioche bread, corn starch, served it with sides of strawberries, raspberries, and maple syrup. I also made a vanilla latte that she likes and brought it to my wife in bed as a nice gesture. However, she didn't eat it and instead complained about the fact that I didn't use eggs. I tried explaining to her that I did that to accomodate my parents, she felt that I shouldn't call this a French toast because there are no eggs and I shouldn't have told her I was making a French toast. Unfortunately we ran out of eggs after thanksgiving and I couldn't make a batter with eggs for her. She didn't eat it, she let it out in the cold and 30 minutes later, she just ate plain bread. Meanwhile, my parents, brother-in-law, and sister enjoyed the French toast and the coffees and were very appreciative of me. I felt hurt by her reaction since I put in the effort to make something that would work for everyone. 

Her disappointment felt like a slap in the face after my efforts. It took me close to two hours to cook and clean early in the morning. The batter was well proportioned and I added whipping cream, nutmeg to make it even tastier. In terms of taste and texture, it felt as good as my previous French toast. I wanted to do it as a warm gesture for everyone to recover from thanksgiving hangover.. I understand that she has her preferences, but I can't help but feel that she was being completely unreasonable and inconsiderate in this situation and we argued because I felt she was clearly on the wrong here. 

So reddit, AITA for making the French toast with corn starch instead of eggs?

EDIT: Cornstarch does bind milk to eggs, I was following the recipe from some food blogs.

Back then he would ask me if I'm going to catch the train. He mostly initiated conversations because I was very shy, even tho there weren't many of them. This semester things changed. I've realised I really like him. He asked me to do a project together and I've opened up a lot so we've talked more freely and light heartedly. About a month ago I realised he looks at me differently. It's a longer look with a genuine smile, not some quick look, half smile and look away just to be polite. He looks at me whenever I walk past him. He checks if I've come back to class after recess. He's become touchy feely and he doesn't do that with other girls. One day we were leaving together but going in different directions. When we are alone we hug hello and goodbye but we've never done that in front of other people. And that day there were other students around us but he looked at me kinda dreamy as if he was waiting til I hug him but it was too late after I realised. I guess I fucked up. I asked him if he wants to grab a coffee last Wednesday and he agreed but informed me that everybody is sick at work and doesn't know if he'll have to go - eventually he did have to work and while telling me he said that ""we can even go with X"" (my best friend at uni, all 3 of us have a project together). So I told him ""alright, next time you're inviting me ;)"" so that he knows the ball is in his court. That was also the only time he texted me first. Idk why he asked about her since he picked up on the fact that we were supposed to go alone. Did he not want to go alone or did he think that X comes with the package? He also doesn't ask if I'm going to the train station anymore. At first I thought he might be into me at least a little but now I'm wondering whether I'm getting mixed signals or feeding my delusions... He doesn't seem like the kinda guy that's ever had a girlfriend so maybe he's trying to hide it if he's even interested. But he's not shy at all as well.",1,1733019791.0,dating,2,1.0,False

1h3spl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/WingsOfFire/comments/1h3spl6/not_quite_either_prologue/,Not Quite Either: Prologue.,"Prompt: a young boy from the world of WoF wakes up one day as a dragon.

  
*About one year ago...*



In the vast, tall mountains of Pyrhia, dominated by the dragons, a small town that was ruled by the humans sat in security from the rest of the hostile lands adjacent to it. *Talisman,* the people call it.



In the town, a large crowd was gathered in the town center, with a small temporary stage that

was set up in the middle for a small group of people that were on it. They were the Dragonmancers, the

strange people who ruled and protected the town with their divine wisdom and knowledge. That day, in

particular, a holiday was occurring, the *Dragonmancer Appreciation Day*. A day made specifically for

praising and giving thanks for Dragonmancer protection.



In the crowd, one man was giving a speech at a remarkable volume, a baker he was. ‚ÄúOh glory

be to the grand Dragonmancers! The ones who save the lives of us all with their impeccable wisdom!‚Äù

The crowd roared with cheer and applause after his speech. Some to him, and some to the

Dragonmancers he was praising.



One of these people was a young boy named Summit. He seemed to be about twelve years old,

sporting brown, curly hair and a rather plain set of clothes. He was standing next to his parents. His

mother, who was named Acorn, had brown hair that curled down to her shoulders. She had an elaborate

purple hat on her head, along with a nice orange and red outfit. His father was named Oakley, he had

black, short hair. His eyes were green, and he had no facial hair.



Oakley looked down towards the stand that the Dragonmancers stood upon. It was used many

times before to hold events, but it could be disassembled and put away to make

more room in the town square. As he looked at it, he could see its coffee-brown color all over it. There

were details all over it. Most of them were meaningless shapes whose sole purpose was to make the stand

less boring, but there were more recognizable symbols. There was the Talisman crest, containing a

dragon‚Äôs head, a Dragonmancer opposing it, the tall mountains that covered the area around the town,

and a forest, which also covered the area around the town. It also contained depictions of the

Dragonmancers doing their incredible duties of protecting Talisman.



Oakley appreciated the small designs on the stand, as he would occasionally practice

woodworking.



He began to talk to his son about it, ‚ÄúSummit, look at the stand. Isn‚Äôt it so nice? All those little

details, all the effort for that beauty.‚Äù



Summit was not all that fascinated by it, but he thought that it looked pretty anyway. ‚ÄúI guess it

looks pretty nice, and it‚Äôs cool how much work the Dragonmancers do for this one day,‚Äù he

responded.



‚ÄúIt is great that the Dragonmancers do this for us.‚Äù He said with his profound respect for the

Dragonmancers.



‚ÄúIt really is! And even better, there‚Äôs a holiday where I don‚Äôt have to go to school for it,‚Äù

Summit said bubbly, happy for everything that was going on that glorious day.



Acorn looked over to Summit as well. ‚ÄúOf course, it‚Äôs great we can spend time together. But

you should remember how important school is too. After all, you‚Äôre going to graduate soon, and you‚Äôll

become an apprentice.‚Äù Acorn said to not only make his child happy but to also make sure that

Summit will continue to receive the gift of knowledge at school. After all, she appreciated the

generosity of the Dragonmancers to give them that knowledge, because giving was the best thing one

could do. That‚Äôs why she tried her best to be the most generous person possible.



While his mother was telling him about the importance of school and all that, Summit began to

look to the memorizing horizon of the mountains, plains, and forests that surround his home. In that

view, he saw something alive. Not alive like a plant, but alive like a *dragon.* The dragon seemed small

from his perspective, but it was approaching, and getting bigger at the same time.



His eyes were locked on this sight for seconds and seconds. He could feel his heart accelerating

by the moment. A twitch in his eye, a twitch in his arm, a twitch in his leg. As he gained better sight of

the danger in little time, he noticed something weird. *Is a person riding that dragon?!* He could not

believe his own eyes, but it seemed that that was indeed the case. *A human working* with *a dragon?*

*That has to be horrible.*



So, he tapped his father Oakley on the shoulder before quickly saying ‚ÄúDad you need to look

over there. It‚Äôs important.‚Äù



Oakley did not seem that interested in losing focus in the celebration that everyone else was in,

but he looked over quickly to silence his son. As he speedily gazed at the land, he saw the danger as well.

An orange dragon, being ridden by a human. Going straight towards Talisman. *Oh no... this is bad. I*

*can‚Äôt risk this. We* need *to go. Home* can‚Äôt *be home,* Oakley thought while fear grazed him in the same

manner as his som. Then, he said to his family ‚ÄúWe need to go. That dragon is too dangerous.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat dragon?!‚Äù Acorn asked nervously. Summit pointed towards the danger, and for the third

time in a minute, a wave of fear grazed a citizen of Talisman. Only this time it was worse because the

danger was much closer. Acorn was *petrified* by this, her heart was moving at light speed from the

impending threat.



While Acorn was frozen in fear, Oakley and Summit started to run as fast as they could out of

the town which would surely soon be sublimated to smolder from the danger. Summit looked back, he

saw that Acorn stood in place, shaking, and looking around nervously. *Why isn‚Äôt Mommy coming?*

Summit thought in a rush of childlike fear as tension built between him, his mother, and Oakley.

‚ÄúCome with us!!! I don‚Äôt want to lose you!‚Äù He called over to his beloved mother.



Quickly after, Acorn heard the message. *I want to go, but I can‚Äôt let Talisman die, it would be*

*wrong to not help them.* Then, she looked over at the approaching demise, seeing its incredible striding

pace. *Never mind!!!* Her mind thought in a shred of an instant. Immediately, Acorn dashed to catch up

with her family. Saving herself, but not sharing security with others.



When they got back together, and they were far enough from Talisman that they would be safe from the danger, they slowed down from a sprint to a jog. Summit was in a fallout of shock and

despair from having to run away from his only home, and they were unsure where to go. ‚ÄúWhere are

we going to go?‚Äù Summit asked his parents nervously.



Acorn and Oakley looked at each other; they had not thought that far yet. They thought about it

for a few seconds. Then, Oakley looked down back at Summit before saying to him ‚ÄúI know

a town we can go to. It‚Äôs the closest one to here. From what I‚Äôve heard, there should be no dragons

there.‚Äù And then they began their journey to the famous *Indestructible City*.



====================================================================



Over roughly ten days, Acorn, Oakley, and Summit trekked through the numerous

mountains, expansive plains, and dense forests to get to their new home. On this dangerous

adventure, they had to act as securely as they could to protect themselves from the dragons that covered

the land. They ducked to make themselves seem small when a dragon would come up from above.

They would hide behind bushes, rocks, a trees on the scary occasion that a dragon would land in an attempt to find food, and they had to sleep in very harsh and uncomfortable positions to guarantee that

they would not be eaten by anything at night. All of that put a lot of pressure, stress, and strain that not

one of them had experienced in their relatively comfortable lives up until then. Especially Acorn, who

became paranoid: Whenever she heard any sound from above, she would duck as far as she could to

keep out of the way of the harm she thought was there.



Regardless of those grueling hardships in search of sanctuary, it eventually came to them. They

walked up to the enormous stone wall that protected the Indestructible City from the outside world, and

Acorn called up in search of salvation ‚ÄúIs anyone there? We search for refuge.‚Äù



Thankfully, there was a guard right by there keeping watch. She looked down at the family that

was the rubble of itself only two weeks ago. ‚ÄúI see you! I need to get somebody for you to help you get

into the Indestructible City,‚Äù the young guard called down to the family before her.



Then, the guard faded from Summit's sight. A couple of minutes passed. The family came close,

hoping that someone would come in through the large door that stood near them on the wall. And then

an older man came out of the door, holding a book and quill. ‚ÄúWelcome to the Indestructible City. My

apprentice has told me of your situation. It must have been a long trek for you, the nearest city is

Talisman, and if I remember correctly it takes more than a week to get there. I will need some

information on you, your names.‚Äù



Acorn looked to the man. ‚ÄúI am Acorn, my husband is Oakley, and my son is Summit. And yes,

we did come here from Talisman. It has been horribly destroyed by a dragon and human working

together,‚Äù she said boringly.



The man looked shocked, ‚Äúa human? And a dragon? Working together? Are you sure you saw

that? I‚Äôve never heard of anything like that ever in my life.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure of it,‚Äù Oakley assured him. ‚ÄúThey were working together. With the person riding the

dragon. I can barely believe it myself if I‚Äôm being honest.‚Äù



The man seemed less shocked now that multiple people agreed with each other, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sorry

for your horrible loss. I‚Äôm sure that we can find some lodging and jobs for you.‚Äù He looked over to

Summit. He was a wreck, to say the least. After all, getting a horrible rest for many nights, fearing for

your life, and losing everything you knew was a lot for just one kid. So, to comfort the child, the man

told Summit ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry about the dragons here, they will never hurt you here. My fellow guards and

I will make sure of it.‚Äù



Summit looked back to the man. ‚ÄúThank you for that,‚Äù Summit said to him in hope.



Acorn then looked over to the man as well and thanked ‚ÄúThank you for helping us so much. I

really appreciate your generosity.‚Äù



‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs just policy. Now let‚Äôs go have you set up in the City,‚Äù the man said. Off they went into

the secure walls of the Indestructible City for a new life, that would be hopefully filled with hope and

prosperity.",4,1733019240.0,WingsOfFire,12,1.0,False

Faced with a tough decision and I'm seeking outside perspective, even from internet strangers. Sorry for the long post, and thanks to anyone who takes the time to read it and respond.

I've been with my girlfriend for a little over two years now. We're both in our early twenties, and we'll both graduate from college in the Spring of 2025. She's a very thoughtful, direct, and organized person, and earlier this year she asked me if I would be comfortable setting a date to have a conversation on where we see our relationship going after we've graduated. I agreed, and we just had that conversation over coffee this morning.

The situation is this: we're going to school in southern California, but come from other parts of the country (her family is from the Chicago area, and mine is from Texas). We've figured out from spending summers apart from each other that long distance is not likely to work long term for us. We like being near each other, and though we texted and called and watched shows together online while we were apart, and other things like this, I think we both felt distant from each other and lonely; long distance is not realistically on the table for either of us.

My parents moved to the PNW last summer. I've had conflicting feelings about this even though I knew it was coming for a while ahead of time. All my friends and most of my close family are in Texas, even people I know from high school who went out of state for college that I look forward to seeing once or twice a year - my parents' moving away has made it so their house no longer feels like my home, and I have to choose between them or my hometown and the people I grew up with. At the same time, I don't hold their decision against them. My younger sister and I are adults and have flown the nest, and I truly believe that my parents are their own people and should do what makes them happy. They have their reasons and I genuinely respect them. I still love them and miss them when I'm away.

I'm a biology student. I've been on the pre-vet track, but I'm looking to take a break from school for at least a year or two before applying to vet schools. During this break I'll probably work in a vet's office or related job and try to build up experience and save money. Up til now, my plan has been to live with my parents at their new place in the PNW so I don't have to worry about rent and can save more money. It's not completely ideal for me - I love my parents, have a good relationship with them, and they treat me like an adult for the most part (no curfews and generally a very hands-off approach with my life now that I'm grown), but I'd like to live under my own roof and maximize my independence if I can. However, I don't really know what other options make sense for where I am in my life, and like I said, I don't mind living with my parents for a while.

I've discussed this with my girlfriend, so she has known about my general plans. She has actually played a major part in my decision to put vet school off for a few years, as she voiced her concerns about me being burnt out academically and maybe not in the best headspace to push ahead. I'm grateful to her for that. She told me in our talk this morning that she has decided she won't follow me to the PNW if I decide to live with my parents. She hates rainy gloomy weather, but says she would be willing to tolerate it if we were living together, which is obviously not on the table if I'm living with my parents. I knew most of this already, but she surprised me a bit when she said she wants us to live together after graduation, at least for a year or two. We could go basically wherever we wanted, work and pay rent together, and decide where to go from there. She didn't want to be pushy but she eventually said definitively that this is what she wants and she wants me to want it too.

I haven't given too many details on my relationship with my GF to this point. She's amazing, and this has been the longest and healthiest relationship of my life. I never have to guess what she's thinking, and if we have a fight or a disagreement we talk it out and come out of it stronger. She's the first partner I've had that truly respects my hobbies (they're on the nerdier side) and is actively supportive and even interested in learning about them herself. She's funny, easy to talk to, honest, really smart, and good at sex. I love her and she loves me, and I think neither of us doubt that about each other. There have been times where we have fallen into ruts and possibly taken each other for granted, but when we notice, we talk about it. I am young and not super experienced, but it doesn't get much better than that, does it?

To be honest, I went into our talk this morning anticipating that we would agree to break up once the school year ended. I've tried to think about it and consider our future on my own, but I've always had some kind of mental block that prevents me from getting overly emotional about that possibility. I've felt resigned, I guess. Throughout our talk I was emotionally fragile in a way that I can't seem to replicate when I'm brooding on my own. When she told me she wanted us to live together, my initial reaction was being anxious. What if it doesn't work out? How will this affect the course of my life, regardless of if it goes right or wrong? There are so many unknowns, and I communicated this to her. But once she made up her mind to push and try and convince me, she pointed out that those same uncertainties are more or less at play even if I stay with my parents. And if things don't work out with her, I'll still have my parents to go back to. She wants me in her life. Our relationship has been so good, I didn't want to let only the fear of losing her companionship affect my decision-making, but by the end of the conversation, I was starting to see things her way.

I asked her if I could take a couple days to process this, call people close to me, and get a clearer idea of what I want. She granted that request, and so as part of that effort, I am asking for Reddit's advice. What would you guys do in my shoes? What factors do you think I should consider? What are things a twenty-something may worry about that they really shouldn't when it comes to things like this? I started today resigned to breaking up with my girlfriend and going home, and am ending it with cautious hope that I can take control of my life and stay with someone I love for longer. I still have the awful feeling that I will come to regret any decision I make.",1,1733019028.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I know this is inevitable to an extent, but my fianc√©‚Äôs family especially has been absolutely nonstop and relentless. We‚Äôre finally under a year to go and it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶a lot. 

Just snippets of conversation lately:

FSIL: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see a registry on your site‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt made it yet, we‚Äôre doing a honeymoon/house fund since we‚Äôve lived together for 3 years and don‚Äôt want things we won‚Äôt use.‚Äù
FSIL: ‚ÄúNo you need to make a registry with actual items on it for people. You need things like a fancy coffee maker (we just replaced our keurig and I‚Äôm the only one who uses it), a carpet cleaner (we have ONE 5x7 area rug), a ninja creami (I‚Äôd rather just buy ice cream than wait 2 days to eat it)‚Ä¶‚Äù

FBIL: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre getting married in Pittsburgh. It‚Äôs SO inconvenient to everyone‚Äù
Me: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a special place to us. It‚Äôs only a 3 hour drive and we have an entire weekend planned for everyone. I‚Äôm tired of the local venues because it‚Äôs always the same 15 places here. It‚Äôs not a destination wedding in Europe that‚Äôs going to cost everyone $9,000 to attend.‚Äù
(This same FBIL just attended a wedding on the other side of the country, in a state he hates traveling to, that he wasn‚Äôt even in the wedding party, and hasn‚Äôt spoken to the groom in 10 years.)

We‚Äôre getting married in the fall, and we‚Äôve chosen very fall colors (rust, emerald, burgundy‚Ä¶)
FSIL: ‚Äúwhat are your colors going to be?‚Äù
Me: *explains*
FSIL Friend RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME: ‚ÄúOh yikes. Good luck shopping for dresses *FSIL name* NONE of those go with your skin tone üò¨‚Äù

It would be interesting to write a longer form piece. Maybe call it ‚Äúenviable degeneracy‚Äù since it feels like that‚Äôs what my life is becoming. Shiny outside, rotten core.

Anyway, here goes:

‚Äî

I wake up on a couch that‚Äôs far bigger and comfier than any that my friends own. That‚Äôs odd enough to make me sit up. Wood-paneled walls. Giant dining table. The place probably rents for 8 grand. What the fuck? Turn my head, which I notice is not on a pillow. Feels weird as I do it, like my brain lags a moment while my head moves in real time. Aha, there ‚Äî on the table. White dinner plate and a rolled up twenty. I remember where I am.

Satisfied, I sink back into the endless couch ‚Äî seriously, who has such big furniture in Boston? How do you move it into an old narrow-doored second-floor walk-up? Oh, duh, you pay people ‚Äî until an hour or so has passed and I‚Äôm sufficiently bored of lying here. I stand up. For once in my life, I decide to be a good guest, and I start picking up seltzer cans off the coffee table. There are eleven of them, all at least 75% full, which makes sense considering all five of us were fucked up before we even got here. I dump them out in the kitchen sink. Glug glug glug. Next comes the ket plate. Clank.

I look awful in the bathroom mirror, but somehow thirty seconds of fixing my hair and wiping dried something off my face completely transforms me. Grunge, but stylish and purposeful. I‚Äôd have a crush on me. I lift my shirt, and my stomach is a little distended. I pee, check again, and my stomach is flat. I look so good, all things considered.

Alright, I‚Äôm done here. I get the hell out of Dodge.

Stop at Philosophy on my walk of shame and get a latte. I order it to go but sit at a table anyway. My head is spinning, so I‚Äôm basically gripping the table for dear life. No headache yet, thank god, but it‚Äôs coming. Back in college, I was a machine built to process alcohol. I‚Äôd get blackout drunk, pass out on a linoleum floor in some dorm somewhere, wake up at 6, and walk home like nothing had happened. I‚Äôm not 19 anymore. So I‚Äôm gonna end up with a headache.

The barista ‚Äî 30-something-year-old with an attitude and RBF, whose name, I now realize, I‚Äôve never bothered to learn despite living in walking distance of Philosophy for like 3 years ‚Äî calls my name. I get up and give an older woman a look that says ‚ÄúI fucking dare you to steal my seat.‚Äù She doesn‚Äôt. Latte art is beautifully done today. A little heart sits on a pile of fanned palm leaves, or stalks of wheat. It‚Äôs a little abstract, probably because it‚Äôs milk foam or whatever. ‚ÄúThanks‚Äù, I say to RBF. ‚ÄúLatte for Parker‚Äù, she says back. Would she know my name if it weren‚Äôt on the screen in front of her? What‚Äôs her excuse? ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù, I say again, this time with a little more oomph. She still doesn‚Äôt hear me over the sound of the milk steamer. Whatever, I fulfilled my end of the social contract. I leave, feeling like a good, thankful person.

I get home and flop in bed. The entire apartment is spinning violently. I never used a centrifuge in college, I recall, which is a little disappointing, but I imagine this is how the test tubes feel. 30 minutes pass. It‚Äôs not spinning anymore, and the latte is kicking in, so I get up. New message from Sonya: ‚ÄúBenny wants to know how you liked DMT.‚Äù I guess I did DMT. God damn it. And, wait a moment, I snorted ket? So much for my golden rule (‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do any powdered drugs lest I accidentally OD on fentanyl‚Äù). Who am I becoming?

I run through my memories of last night. I remember sitting next to Sonya‚Äôs hot uncle and being in love with him and wondering if we were about to kiss. I remember how snorting through a rolled-up bill felt surprisingly natural. At one point I was on the floor, which might be related to the nascent bruise on my elbow.

‚ÄúDid you meet god lol‚Äù texts Sonya, which is a fair question. Honestly I can‚Äôt distinguish the feeling of the DMT trip from the ket, and I can‚Äôt distinguish the feeling of the ket from the alcohol, so I don‚Äôt see any point in responding. I either didn‚Äôt meet God or it just wasn‚Äôt noteworthy.

The rest of the day is uneventful. I head into the office around 4, work there until 10 or so. It still has that new house smell. The lights are on, so I guess someone triggered the motion sensors recently. I badge in, walk through the lobby, and my shoes squeak loudly on the pristine waxed concrete. The floor is lifeless except for one managing director who I often see on Sundays. I make eye contact with him as I walk in, press my mouth into a flat line, and give him a slight nod. He returns the gesture. I think I know his name, and I‚Äôm almost certain he does not know mine. Past him, I walk by 20 glass offices, lights off, doors closed, until I reach my own glass office, drop my backpack, plug in my laptop, and go to the kitchen. No one‚Äôs brewed coffee today so I have to pre-heat the Keurig. This bothers me because now I have to wait another 45 seconds, and my time is valuable, because why else would I be here on a Sunday? Outside is already dark and gloomy. I hate winter in Boston. The city is so far north and east that dusk falls in late afternoon. Fuck, feels like someone is driving a nail through my frontal cortex ‚Äî the hangover, right on schedule ‚Äî so I pop an Advil during this endless wait and finger a full-caffeine Keurig pod. As the coffee brews into a glass mug, I rifle through the fridge. I choose a pot-set yogurt over the individually-packaged charcuterie with the chalky crackers. I sip the coffee as I walk back to my office. It tastes like it came out of a Keurig.

I send an email that‚Äôs likely going to get several people laid off. I don‚Äôt really know what these people do, but I know that I can manage their company better than they can, so it doesn‚Äôt matter in the end. I think of their families. That‚Äôs a joke, I think about the impact to EBITDA margins. These people are just names in my spreadsheet (Last, First) and probably don‚Äôt exist outside the context of this company. But yeah, I send that executioner-style email, shut my laptop, and go home. I think about how I should feel bad. I don‚Äôt feel anything. I‚Äôm 26 years old. It should scare me that I feel nothing.

You might know it as ‚ÄúThe Place People Accidentally End Up When They Misspell Glasgow Uni.‚Äù But let me tell you, the real Strathy experience isn‚Äôt about lectures, clubs, or those cursed stairs on Rottenrow. No, it‚Äôs about perfecting the fine art of being lonely but in a quirky, endearing way.

Chapter 1: The Lone Library Wanderer

Picture this: it‚Äôs 2 a.m. in the Andersonian Library. You‚Äôre on level 5, the quiet floor, because you secretly enjoy the oppressive silence. You‚Äôve got a single, half-empty Red Bull, and your laptop‚Äôs battery is on 3%‚Äîjust like your social life. You glance around at the other students, wondering if any of them might be the soulmate you‚Äôll never talk to. Congratulations, you‚Äôre now the protagonist of a Netflix coming-of-age movie no one asked for.

Chapter 2: Strath Union and the Roasters Coffee Dilemma

Ah, Strath Union‚Äîthe promised land of friendship and overpriced lattes. You walk in, fully convinced this is where your social life will finally take off. You grab a coffee from Roasters, the Union‚Äôs heart and soul, and attempt to sit at a table. But as you scan the room, you realize every other table is occupied by intense group project meetings or people who‚Äôve clearly been best friends since the womb.

Instead of interrupting what looks like a micro-UN summit, you strategically sit at the corner table by the window, pretending to be busy on your laptop. (Translation: you‚Äôre googling ‚ÄúHow to make friends at university‚Äù while sipping a flat white you can‚Äôt afford.) Every so often, someone walks past, and you try to make eye contact, but they‚Äôre too busy debating whether to buy a second round of brownies. Meanwhile, your coffee‚Äôs gone cold‚Äîjust like your dreams of social connection.

Bonus points if you spill your drink and make a dramatic exit. Nothing screams ‚ÄúStrathy student experience‚Äù like the walk of shame out of the Union while everyone pretends not to notice your damp trousers.

Chapter 3: Society Social Fails

You joined six societies during Freshers‚Äô Week, right? Because this year was going to be different. Yet somehow, you‚Äôve managed to ghost every event like a social Houdini. The one time you did show up to the debating society, you realized halfway through that arguing about parking policies wasn‚Äôt quite the existential thrill you were looking for.

Now your inbox is just filled with guilt-inducing emails: ‚ÄúHi AJ, haven‚Äôt seen you in a while! Come to Pub Night!‚Äù Sure, Karen, I‚Äôll just totally overcome my introversion for a pint at a bar where no one knows my name.

Chapter 4: The Tesco Night Walks

When the loneliness gets overwhelming, you pull out the big guns: a late-night Tesco trip. You‚Äôre not even hungry, but walking the aisles of the St. Enoch branch is your therapy. There‚Äôs something oddly comforting about choosing between the value noodles and the fancy ones while a soft instrumental cover of Coldplay‚Äôs ‚ÄúFix You‚Äù plays overhead. Bonus points if you accidentally make eye contact with another solo shopper and both of you look away immediately, bonded by mutual shame.

Chapter 5: The Strath Union Mirage

The Strath Union is supposed to be where you ‚Äúfind your people.‚Äù Instead, it feels like speed-dating but sadder. You go to one of their events, realize everyone already seems to know someone, and suddenly you‚Äôre back in high school standing awkwardly by the punch bowl. 
Pro tip: always look like you‚Äôre texting someone important. ‚ÄúSorry, can‚Äôt talk right now, just arranging a meeting with Tylor Swift.‚Äù

Chapter 6: The ‚ÄúMe, Myself, and the M8‚Äù

At some point, the loneliness peaks, and you consider your options:
	1.	Befriend the pigeons at George Square.
	2.	Take the megabus to literally anywhere else and start fresh.
	3.	Start a one-person flash mob on Buchanan Street.

But then, a glimmer of hope: you find yourself actually laughing at the absurdity of it all. Like, why does the M8 bisect the city center? Why do seagulls at Strath look like they could bench press you? Why did you buy three candles at Primark when you don‚Äôt even like candles? Suddenly, the loneliness feels a bit‚Ä¶ manageable.

In conclusion, if you‚Äôre a lonely Strath student, just know you‚Äôre not alone in your aloneness. We‚Äôre all out here wandering the streets of Glasgow, avoiding human interaction and debating if it‚Äôs socially acceptable to order Deliveroo three nights in a row. 
So, let‚Äôs embrace the chaos and lean into the vibe of being the city‚Äôs most tragic yet comedic character.

P.S. If anyone wants to grab a sad sandwich ‚Äîor even better, a sad coffee at Roasters‚Äîhmu.

We do a cozy morning just the two of us‚Äîcoffee, a nice breakfast, and opening gifts. It‚Äôs simple, and we love it. Later in the day, we head over to his parents‚Äô house for dinner. This has been our routine for years and it‚Äôs something I really look forward to.

Now, my sister-in-law (Emily) has always been a bit‚Ä¶ over the top when it comes to holidays. This year, she decide to host the *ultimate* Christmas party at her house on Christmas Eve, and she‚Äôs planning on making it a two-day event‚ÄîChristmas Eve party, then staying over for Christmas Day brunch and gift exchange. She invited all of us, including Ben and me, to stay the night and participate in everything.

I told her that we already have our own plans for Christmas morning and that we would *love* to come to the party on Christmas Eve but we‚Äôd be heading home after that to enjoy the morning together just as we always have. I thought it was reasonable. Well, Emily was *not* having it. She practically demanded that we change our Christmas morning plans to join her for brunch the next day. She said if we didn‚Äôt, it would ‚Äúruin the vibe of the whole holiday‚Äù and that we‚Äôd be ‚Äúchoosing our little private tradition over family.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt cave. I told her our Christmas morning tradition was important to us and that we‚Äôd see her at the party, but we wouldn‚Äôt be staying over or changing our plans. Now, she‚Äôs giving me the cold shoulder, and Ben‚Äôs family is starting to get involved, saying I should be more flexible for the ‚Äúfamily experience.‚Äù

I really don‚Äôt want to rock the boat, but at the same time, I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have to completely change our holiday just to meet her expectations.

I have this kapatid (21) M. nagtatrabaho na. mas pinili nyang magtrabaho kesa magtapos. Nagpaubaya ako pero sinayang nya yung pinang aral sa kanya ng aming ina. 

Habang nasa 2nd or 3rd yr sumasideline yan sa pagtatrabaho sa *emz* dto sa City namin. Umalis kesyo ganto ganyan dami dahilan sa isip isip ko di ka ba muna magtiis hanggang sa magtapos ka? Kase ako nakakapagtiis ako sa trabaho kapag alam kong may umaasa saking pamilya e. Breadwinner ako sa pamilya kahit di ako nakapagtapos. Pero di naman namin inaasa sa kanya yung responsibilidad na tumulong sa pamilya kumbaga magtiis ka muna dyan sa work na yan para yung baon mo sa araw araw di mo na ihingi sa Mama. (ang mama kasambahay po) pero hindi e, umalis at mas piniling maghanap ng trabaho. 

Mas piniling magtrabaho para matustusan ang nakasanayang LUHO habang sumasideline sya non. lakas magkape sa iba't ibang coffee shop. Nag aaral & working, nakakapagod. ALAM KO RANAS KO pero yung magkaroon ng nakasanayan na luho? NO wala ako non. ang mindset ko kase ibibili ko na lang ng ulam namin sa bahay kesa magpakasarap ako ng ako lang, alam kong hindi lang ako yung taong kapag kumakain sa labas ay di naiisip yung tao sa bahay. 

Nung umalis sya don sa pinagsidelinan nya nag apply apply ng trabaho.

I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed and at a loss. I used to think progress looked like more vegan options in restaurants, more vegan restaurants entirely, vegan options at chains, non-vegan brands coming out with vegan options, etc. After researching PBC, that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case, and most, if not all of these ‚Äúvegan‚Äù options aren‚Äôt actually vegan. 

So what does progress look like? 

The largest U.S. dairy milk company announced in 2019 that they were filing for bankruptcy and closing their doors. They cited plant-based milk as their reasoning behind not making enough profits. The popularity of veganism was even cited as a reason they closed. Yet, that company owned a PBC company (non-dairy milk company) from 2002-2013. The big corp consolidated that brand and became independent from 2013-2018 before being bought by a different non-vegan brand in 2018. 

That sounds like progress to me. The largest dairy company had to close up shop? That‚Äôs amazing. And it‚Äôs amazing that we‚Äôre part of the reason why. 

Through PBC, a certain non-dairy plant milk brand, and similar ‚Äúvegan‚Äù companies owned by non-vegan corporations are not actually vegan. They don‚Äôt care about animal liberation at all, they just want our money. Yet, that brand, and other non-vegan ‚Äúvegan‚Äù companies (specifically plant milks) are driving the change and saving lives. The only non-PBC available in my area is one that tastes gross. Plus, not many people carry it at local coffee shops and such, usually they carry a PBC brand. What do we do in this instance?

The time has come for the debriefing of the events that had taken place for the strike team in charge of the Siren force that was meant to ambush the Commander. Now they will bring to light what happened at such time, but not only to the important people within Azur Lane, but also more people of interest have been invited. The commander is intrigued as the details of the event are to be kept secret until the Debrief meeting requested by Akagi herself.

# Chapter 1: Aiding Spirits.

Although the commander wanted to at least look far more reliable than what he felt like, both Chkalov and Yuubari had pointed out that he had been taken out of his duties, in order to participate in the sudden picnic that had taken place by the test site, mainly to take his mind away from his bout of loneliness and worry, with both Enterprise and Belfast having gone to the strike mission to tackle an siren of unknown capabilities, his capability to focus on proper work had truly been put to the test.

Thanks to his friends, companions and coworkers, he managed to complete a full day of work, although he had somewhat restless sleep. At some point in the middle of the night he fortunately had a pleasant dream of his wives coming back to him, greeting him with a warm embrace and joining in bed with him to simply rest alongside him, this dream brought to him enough peace of mind to let him have a more restful sleep for the reminder of the night.

When morning came he realized that it had not been a dream at all, as his morning had begun the same way he wanted for the rest of his days to begin like. Belfast had opened the curtains to their room, letting the first rays of light come into the room, he found himself with Enterprise cuddled onto his side, showing signs of stirring from her sleep, still wearing most of her uniform minus the cap and her coat which was neatly folded on the nightstand on her side of the bed with the cap on top of it, most likely Belfast‚Äôs work.

The Royal navy cruiser had turned his way and was now looking intently at him, with a warm smile on her face.

‚ÄúAnything you wish to start the day with, dear?‚Äù Belfast asked, a teasing smile on her face.

‚ÄúTruth be told. At this moment, I happen to have everything I wished for within hand reach‚Äù Anderson said, lifting his hand towards Belfast, being careful to not move too much and shake Enterprise out of her current half-asleep state.

‚ÄúCareful dear, we have a day full of meetings and plenty of work ahead of us. You risk getting late to most of that if any of your corny lines manage to strike true, and you end up stirring something other than our dear Enterprise‚Äù Belfast sat at the bed, holding his hand, sounding stern yet smiling mischievously at him.

‚ÄúOne must know when to take a calculated risk.‚Äù He said.

‚ÄúDear, you are terrible at math.‚Äù She replied, leaning forward and giving him a brief kiss. ‚ÄúAnd good morning to you too, Enterprise, dear.‚Äù

By now enterprise had most likely reached the closest she was to being awake that she would be without a cup of coffee. Belfast‚Äôs morning kiss was soon followed by another from the commander as well.

Starting her day with kisses from both her spouses was in itself an idyllic beginning of a day, Enterprise thought to herself, with only one thing being able to make it even better.

‚ÄúCan we stay like this for maybe five more minutes?‚Äù Enterprise said.

‚ÄúYes, Belfast. Can we stay for five more minutes?‚Äù The commander said, mimicking Enterprise, yet sounding much more playful about it, with a big grin to his face.

‚ÄúYou, goofballs.‚Äù Belfast laughed in an open and joyful way, without the usual self-controlled elegance she was publicly known for, a sound much more reserved for her house and her partners.

‚ÄúI will get breakfast started, we have a long day ahead of us, it would be unsightly for any of us to arrive late to the coming meetings.‚Äù Belfast said.

Regardless of her words, she had actually laid beside the commander, with her head resting on his chest, her hand reaching and stroking Enterprise‚Äôs cheek. She stayed that way for a few minutes, listening to the sound of the commander‚Äôs heartbeat and looking intently at Enterprise who in turn couldn‚Äôt help but to blush slightly at Belfast‚Äôs attentions.

After a while she kissed them once again, she stood up and made her way to the kitchen to comply with her own words.

‚ÄúEnterprise, dear. Do we have many meetings today?‚Äù The commander asked.

Enterprise groaned in response, getting up and sitting beside the commander, her hand on his, with their fingers almost immediately entwining together.

‚ÄúWe have one for certain. And after that we might have several more. More technical and with more explanations about what we explained before‚Äù She replied as she rubbed her eyes.

‚ÄúSo, about the usual.‚Äù

Enterprise chuckled in response. ‚ÄúYou are not entirely wrong at that. But things got dangerous this time.‚Äù

That got the commander up immediately, sitting on their bed alongside Enterprise, looking at her up and down, making sure she was whole and healthy, then focusing on her violet eyes.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not something you would say lightly. Is everyone fine?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are fine.‚Äù She shook her head minutely at that ‚Äúmostly, scratches and bruises. But we saw some distressing things this time. Both for better and worse. We will discuss all of it on a special debriefing requested by Akagi‚Äù

She looked at the window, her eyes darting back to the sight of the sea outside.

For his part, the commander didn‚Äôt need to ask if there was something else that he could do to be of assistance. He had grown to know much more about both of his wives than anyone else. As such he moved forward and embraced Enterprise during her sudden bout of anxiousness. Thinking about it, Belfast had allowed them for their laziness to slide all too easily, which meant that their will-of-steel-wife was still anxious about whatever they had seen out there.

\*\*

The commander assumed that having started the day with both his wives at his side would ease it up and everything until the moment the ominous debriefing could come.

He was wrong.

There had somehow been piles of paperwork ready for him in his office. At first he assumed it was another bureaucratic prank by Saratoga, until he realized that the pink haired carrier was on her desk in his office, reviewing her own sizable stack of papers. They had exchanged their morning greetings and began working in earnestly to complete the paperwork that had somehow sneaked past the two of them. At some point Helena had arrived with a mug of freshly brewed coffee, and unfortunately along with yet another substantial pile of papers.

According to Helena, the ideas that the little girl Song had given the previous day right after the sparring between the Valkyrie CobbleClobber, and Tennessee, had created an influx of requests for materials, resources as well as permissions to use certain facilities. All of it with the idea of testing certain theories and ideas that the ladies of Azur Lane had apparently already had floating in their minds for some time now.

The requests came from all factions, soliciting all manners of stuff, asking for things ranging from the somewhat reasonable, like armored practice dummies, to the completely baffling. Rather markedly was the request to allow free usage of their collection of weaponry they had built over the years, which consisted of dozens of traditional weapons that had been donated to them over the years, including fancy firearms, powerful guns, and even some more traditional, swords and crossbows included.

But things didn‚Äôt end there. The arrival of the Valkyries to port had been, somehow, their first instance of cooperation outside of coordinated operations near a coastal city. More specifically, the fact that CobbleClobber had given such great results during the spar.

It was more or less an expected and unspoken piece of knowledge that the Valkyries would be weaker than the Kansen. But in reality no one had really given too much thought to this. The results of the spar between the Valkyrie ‚ÄúCoby‚Äù and the Kansen Tennessee, had been so close to being a draw that the misconception of Valkyries being much weaker, had been completely shaken.

The subject in itself had brought some questions from people on various positions on different governments, which as a result had sent messages inquiring about the possibility of joint exercises or training performed between the two different branches.

When the time for the debriefing had arrived, with the clock in his office telling him that it wasn‚Äôt even midday yet, he had the passing thought that the debriefing might not be a change for the better from him being in his office.

¬†

As he made his way to the room that would hold the debrief, a small auditorium within the base, he turned to Helena, who accompanied him while Saratoga remained in the office as she had decided to remain and complete as much of the paperwork as possible, and asked the blue haired Eagle Union cruiser regarding the current arrangement.

‚ÄúI have been told that Akagi herself requested the use of this room. Which is surprising, I thought that with her taking the initiative for this, she would have set something‚Ä¶ less neutral‚Äù The commander said after weighing his word choice as to best describe Akagi‚Äôs well known biases.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know either commander, the request had come from her without a doubt, she made a special attendance list which was along the lines of what we originally expected, but it was also a bit more than that‚Äù Helena said, checking on the papers she had on her clipboard.

‚ÄúShe requested for Amagi and Kaga to be present.‚Äù She said.

‚ÄúThat much is expected,‚Äù He replied.

‚ÄúShe also asked for Nagato, Yamashiro, Fusou and Kasumi to attend.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ rather unusual.‚Äù He added, arching an eyebrow as he mentally reviewed those choices.

Those were truly names of Kansen from the Sakura Empire, but not necessarily among those that were known to be in actual-good terms with Akagi and her ideologies, or actions.

‚ÄúShe also asked for the leaders of all remaining factions to be present.‚Äù

The commander furrowed his eyebrows at that. This coming meeting kept getting more disquieting the more information he heard about it.

He was deep in his thoughts regarding the choice of people solicited by Akagi, that it almost caught him by surprise when they had reached the room in question. What had caught him unawares was how quiet the place was. ‚ÄúQuiet‚Äù was something that was often sought after within Azur Lane‚Äôs base, not something that happened naturally at a place where many of the lively fighting ladies were gathered at.

‚ÄúDid we reach the wrong room, Helena? It is distinctly quiet.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I don't think so‚Ä¶‚Äù She said looking at her wristwatch as she drew closer to the door ‚Äúand it‚Äôs the right time too.‚Äù

Helena went ahead and opened up the door, suddenly going still, the commander disqueted by this, quickly moved to her side, soon realizing what had happened. Inside of the room were various of the girls that were to attend the debriefing, all of them seemingly talking between each other or just sitting somewhere waiting for the meeting to start. All of this was happening right in front of their eyes without even a single sound being produced by anyone.

‚ÄúWhat the‚Ä¶‚Äù The commander made his way inside of the room, suddenly surprised as the sounds suddenly came alive once he had set foot inside of the room.

‚ÄúWha? What was that?!‚Äù

‚ÄúAh commander you have finally arrived, good to see you.‚Äù

Yorktown, Enterprise‚Äôs eldest sister was the first to greet the commander once he was inside of the room, he was still somewhat confused about what had transpired regarding the lack of sounds coming from the room, and now the silver haired Union carrier had also confused him somewhat with her presence.

‚ÄúI know what you are thinking, this seems to be a meeting in which only all the faction heads should attend, but Enterprise asked me to be here, for some reason.‚Äù She had made her way towards him, as she had been not too far from the door to begin with, making him realize he had been speechless until this point.

He greeted her back minutely, with his eyebrows knitting together as soon as he was able to process what Yorktown had said.

‚ÄúEnterprise did? For a debriefing?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know! I thought she wanted some extra support from me, as she was rather insistent on me being part of it, but she seems fine, if anything she seems impatient for this to start. Did she tell you anything about this?‚Äù

The commander shook his head in response. Both Enterprise and Belfast had said that they would explain everything in full, but they made a point in expressing how it would be better for everyone if the whole strike team made a recount of the events.

‚ÄúNo, they said they wanted everyone to hear them together on this.‚Äù

He looked at the room, and much like in Yorktown‚Äôs case, there were other participants that were not among those initially requested for. He saw the leaders of each faction in the room, as well as other Kansen belonging from the same factions, and even related somehow to those that took part in the strike team.

Friederich was sitting right beside Bisckmark, which wasn‚Äôt such an oddity in itself, although it was not that common seeing two of the leaders of the reformed Iron Blood in the same meeting, as between the two of them virtually half the responsibilities of leadership of their nation rested on their shoulders.

The current leader of the Royal navy, King George, was present and right beside her sat Implacable, which was not an unwelcome addition, simply a questionable one specially regarding the motives under which she was invited for, specially given that the current meeting had no religious nuances that he knew of.

There was the case of the Sakura empire, which had perhaps the most participants outside of their local leadership. Nagato sat with Kawakaze right beside her, which wasn‚Äôt rare at all. Amagi was by their side too right next to Kaga, which was in itself a rare sight, but he figured that Akagi wanted to show off in front of her sisters. But behind them were Yamashiro, her sister Fusou, Yuubari, and Kasumi.

If it had been only Yuubari, he could understand, as she was one of the heads of research in the base, so if there was some technical doubt to dispel she was the right choice, everyone else was kind of a curve ball to him.

‚ÄúKnight Commander, Helena, great timing. Come, we should get started now that everyone is present.‚Äù Warspite had made her way towards the two of them, likely the very moment she had seen them.

‚ÄúAnd sorry, Miss Yorktown, I will make a point about giving back your brother-in-law as soon as he is done with work‚Äù Warspite explained to the Union carrier as she dragged both him and Helena to the main stage.

Once he was there, he greeted each one of the participants of the last day‚Äôs mission. He knew they would be fine, as he believed in each one of them. But it was always a world of difference to see them well and healthy with his own eyes.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you all are well and present here today, I was worried.‚Äù He said honestly, the moment he stood in front of them. He had no qualms about being as open and sincere as he felt when it came to his feelings when it came to the Kansen, both them and him simply functioned much better that way, to pretend to be someone or something that you were not was one of the fastest ways to lose faith with the Kansen. They were more willing to accept someone who was ready to admit their own flaws and shortcomings and work on them, than to work with someone who was in a constant state of denial over their own problems or shortcomings. A few admirals had discovered this before the arrival of Commander Anderson.

There were various acknowledgements as well as the back and forward of the commander and the Kansen greeting each other, as he went and greeted each one of them, a kind of short greeting to make sure they were fine and felt well enough for whatever was going to take place.

‚ÄúOk, it feels like there's a lot of secrecy going around about this. Is there any specific reason for this?‚Äù the commander asked once he was done with checking with each one of the ten girls in front of him.

‚ÄúYes, dear Commander\~‚Äù Akagi took the moment to start the explanation.

The commander couldn‚Äôt help being surprised by that, Akagi was quick to seize opportunities such as this one in order to talk with him. But it was a whole different matter for her to be explaining something that concerned their whole group.

‚ÄúWe agreed that what we saw during our mission would have to be explained far too many times. And as cross as I might be, to be unable to retell you these events as many times as you request of me, dear commander, truth is, we decided we should talk as little as possible lest some information becomes some sort of an exaggerated gossip.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is as Akagi said.‚Äù Warspite followed ‚ÄúWe are certain that more of a debriefing it will turn into some sort of forum, where we will be asked many questions. As such, the usage of this room seemed ideal, everything will be recorded, so it can be reviewed as many times as necessary.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶ it makes sense when you put it that way, even from my point of view, as much as I am still in the dark about this.‚Äù

‚ÄúAww commander! don‚Äôt be sad about that, we aren‚Äôt keeping secrets from you. I think this will make you much more excited if you hear it all in one single telling! With no spoilers! Like a movie!‚Äù Z16 said cheerfully as she beamed at him, mimicking boxing motions as well as the sounds, referring to the action movie part.

‚ÄúOh, that reminds me. There was this strange thing happening just before we entered the room, We couldn‚Äôt hear any of you until I stepped inside‚Äù The commander said as he pointed at the now closed door.

‚ÄúOh. That was me, my dear commander\~‚Äù Akagi said.

She signaled to the corners of the room, in each one there was one of her red Shikigami papers, these glowed faintly in unison. It was obvious it was some manner of Sakuran magic, which surprised the commander, he had seen very little of it outside of combat where the Sakurans would use it freely for combat. This was a rather tactical usage, much more subtle than what he had seen Akagi ever use before.

‚ÄúNow, commander, you seem to be thinking some rude about your Akagi\~‚Äù

‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ surprised.‚Äù He said honestly ‚ÄúThis is rather tactical. I don‚Äôt think you are one to try and have others not hear about your achievements, or failings. But I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be one to hide from your own shortcomings, not that I think you put less than your best for the mission.‚Äù

‚Äúfufu\~ Commander really knows me well\~‚Äù

The Kitsune said with a soft loving laugh, her index finger reaching her lips as she smiled in a longing and improper way, especially now that she was looking at a married man, with both of his spouses right beside her.

‚ÄúI see‚Ä¶ and what about the additional people? Not that I distrust the judgement of any of you, just seems peculiar there are more people than normal, especially those that not the heads of each faction‚Äù

‚ÄúWelp, as for them‚Ä¶ I guess we are certain they will want to be here. and in some cases we want them to be present for what we will show them‚Ä¶‚Äù Enterprise answered him, she looked at her sister as she did and didn't elaborate anymore after.

‚ÄúAaanyways!‚Äù Minneapolis interrupted, crossing her arms over her chest ‚ÄúThere's many spirits to appease, literally. Might as well get started commander, my spiritual sisters will want to perform plenty of rites after this I am sure of this.‚Äù

The commander was once again surprised, he furrowed his brow and nodded at the girls, making his way to the podium. He figured that the best way to clear all doubts was to simply make the debriefing happen. He greeted everyone and thanked them for their efforts as well as their time for being able to be present here with them. After the general greeting he began with the explanations of what had happened so far, that he knew of, at least.

‚ÄúTwo days ago we arrived from a task regarding bringing Doctor Bethencourt, Doctor Soriz and the little girl Song, which we believe is a living concept, created by the Doctor. During this trip we encountered one Siren force that seemed to be part of a bigger group meant to ambush our convoy.‚Äù

As he talked, pictures of the people he had been talking about were shown behind him. Showing the doctors arriving to Azur Lane and the girl eating food at a beachside barbecue, which in turn was met with endearing responses over the adorable girl.

‚ÄúWe fought and dispatched 3 vessel replicas, battlecruisers, but we made contact with one unknown Siren. This much you might have heard before.‚Äù

He stated that clearly and stopped to look at his audience, most of them seemed to react in surprise hearing this for the first time, or nodding in agreement as they had been privy of these facts so far.

‚ÄúThis Siren seemed to be a new form of Elite, she communicated over the open lines and for a lack of a better way to put it, she got chatty with us until we blew her vessel up.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe managed to land a hit on Kent, incapacitating one of her turrets, then she attacked us, severely hurting Brooklyn, her vessel, as well as inflicting some minor damage on a combat with Reno and Suffren, until she fled.‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter this, a strike force was arranged. Tasked with dealing with the other part of the likely ambush, they left port the same evening after we arrived with the Doctors. Today we will hear from their mission. Thank you.‚Äù

The commander had felt the need to explain a little more, seeing people that had not been part of this task force present, and taking this chance as well to jog his memory a little bit regarding the previous events, he felt like a lot had happened and he was growing concerned he might be overlooking some facts too.

When he stepped back from the podium, it was Warspite who stepped up to talk next. With Helena accompanying her and arranging an extra stepping platform on the podium, nothing was said of this as everyone knew better.

‚ÄúThank you, knight commander. Everyone present here, as well.‚Äù Warspite started. ‚ÄúThe commander requested of us to assemble a task force to deal with the possible remnants of an ambush fleet.

Six of us agreed to this and made arrangements to leave, come the departing time someone else added herself to our numbers‚Äù She said, closing her eyes as if trying to remember the events, or more than likely, to try to keep her cool.

‚ÄúCome the morning of the very same day, we realized that our own submarines had been stalking us.‚Äù It was obvious she couldn‚Äôt help herself as she sighed loudly at that point.

‚ÄúBut alas, this might as well be a time to learn another lesson about humility, we might have perished were not for our submarines‚Äù

‚ÄúWolfpack! wolfpack!‚Äù was heard from among the girls on the stage,

‚ÄúNot now!‚Äù a more subdued voice hissed back at them.

‚ÄúWe encountered a single humanoid siren at the likely place for the Ambush, open sea between a few small islands.‚Äù Warspite pointed to the screen behind her, which was showing pictures taken by them, barely recognizable a single siren with black dots around her, moving on the water.

‚ÄúWhen dealt with, we heard a radio com, most likely automated, telling about a triggered ‚ÄòInverted Mirror Sea‚Äô‚Äù Warspite pointed, a new picture showing how the sky suddenly looked like broken glass.

‚ÄúThis caught us unawares, as we hadn‚Äôt detected any signs of mirror seas present, we soon found ourselves right in the middle one.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe encountered a mixed fleet of mass produced siren vessels, attacking us. We had to make a strategic repositioning, as we were in the middle of them. However, these were of no real import out of their surprise attack.‚Äù Warspite pointed to the screen as a new image took place.

A red sky covered with black airplanes, their design at first caught everyone‚Äôs attention until they realized what they were looking at, received with a variety of feelings upon the visage, with more than a few gasping sounds resounding in the room.

‚ÄúZero‚Äôs?!‚Äù someone from the Sakuran group said.

‚ÄúThis is the second point of interest of our encounter. We faced almost endless waves of these enhanced Black Zero‚Äôs. These were strong enough that they were able to pierce our armor with their bullets.‚Äù Warspite added with some obvious concern in her voice.

‚ÄúWe believe the mirror sea was providing some manner of assistance in the production and handling of these, as once our submarines took care of the device producing the mirror sea, the number of airplanes decreased significantly as well as some of their skill in battle.‚Äù

Another picture was shown, this one taken by the submarine girls, showing a siren machine, powered by a siren cube inside of it, most of the eeriness of such device being underwater was dispelled as the submarines had taken their pictures by posing beside the deactivated device, with victory signs as well as wide grins on their faces.

At that, Warspite simply ignored the lack of professionalism on that one shot without uttering a word, moving onto her next subject.

‚ÄúWith the Mirror sea effect not supporting the enemies in the field, the rest of these black aircraft were dispatched. Giving us the opportunity to look for the source of the planes‚Äù

Warspite didn‚Äôt need to point at the next photograph, for everyone‚Äôs attention was on it, especially those from both the Sakura Empire and the Eagle Union. Everyone else in the room picked on little weird details and found a certain sense of familiarity on the black replicas.

‚ÄúWe hampered their propellers, and when we reached these vessels, the Humanoid Siren leading this attack was already gone. Akagi identified these vessels as Amagi class aircraft carrier replicas.‚Äù

Warspite lifted both of her hands up when the ensuing chaos of questions made itself present, asking everyone to stay calm and sit down.

‚ÄúThis is where my part of the report ends. Akagi will be the one explaining next.‚Äù Warspite stated, not waiting to see if anyone had any more questions and simply making her way back to her seat.

Akagi made her way the moment that Warspite was off the podium, moving with certainty without seeming to be in a rush at all. In fact, regardless of what had been said, she seemed rather calm, the commander could imagine Akagi going ballistic against the sirens when they used the likeness of her sister‚Äôs rigging. Yet Akagi didn‚Äôt seem to be bothered in the least, rather, she seemed like was pleasantly content with herself.

‚ÄúThanks for being here everyone. First, let me get straight to it. You might be wondering how we fended off the continuous onslaught of the enhanced enemy aircraft. And I am certain your best guess is wrong.\~‚Äù

‚ÄúWhile Enterprise-san played an important role in holding the aircraft back within the best of her capabilities, we were assisted by a higher power.‚Äù

Akagi‚Äôs words were met with a low murmur full of skepticism, as well as many confused stares coming from all directions but those behind her in the same stage as her. Akagi continued talking as she made her way towards the area where the rest of her compatriots were sitting at.

She was but mere steps away from them when she stopped, she gave them a wry smile and she was soon enveloped in pink flames. The room was suddenly aghast as the kitsune momentarily disappeared under the pink fire, but the fire started dissipating away, almost as if it was composed of petals carried away by the wind, revealing Akagi wearing a different attire than the one she had before.

The kitsune in front of them was wearing an ornate kimono, white, pink and red were the colors used for an intricate pattern that was both simple as well as beautiful. Wearing a necklace of magatama as well as a hagoromo that seemed to be made of a combination of silk and fire.

To everyone‚Äôs eyes it looked like Akagi not only had made a magical change of clothes, but some couldn‚Äôt help to notice the tips of her tails seemed to emit a red glow like burning coals and those who looked further saw a pink light coming from her eyes.

That was what anyone from outside the Sakuran Isles saw. For those that were more accustomed with their folklore and history they saw something vastly different. Such an example was the case of the Fusou sisters, and Kasumi.

While everyone else from the Sakuran group had been shocked. The three of them had immediately jumped from their seats and prostrated themselves in front of Akagi.

This had evidently shocked everyone else, even those from the Sakuran faction, to the point that even Amagi herself seemed like she wanted to say something to her sister but was too surprised to do so.

‚ÄúOh, Sacred tree. We, your humble servants, greet you.‚Äù Fusou spoke, using a formal tone of voice, her manner of speech paced and full of humility, an incredible contrast with her usual warm demeanor.

‚ÄúYou can stand.‚Äù Akagi said with a solemn tone of voice. ‚ÄúI am but a servant of the sacred tree as well, he is within me. He is with us through me, but your deference and obligations should remain to it.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt shall be as you say, Akagi-sama.‚Äù Fusou proclaimed, standing up and bowing deeply towards the kitsune.

Akagi now looked all around the room before she continued her exposition.

‚ÄúAmist the battle, our Sacred Tree, who protects our Sakuran Isles, contacted me, it gave me a mission and lent me some of its power to accomplish this. As it appears the Sirens have new ways to further debase themselves.‚Äù Akagi said as she pointed at the screen.

In the screen there could be seen the pictures taken from within the Siren copied vessels, some of their corridors as well as a few of their rooms, after a couple pictures they ended in one showing a black sphere with the contents of it barely visible.

Akagi moved her hands into her kimono, producing a few items which she put on the table in front of Nagato, Kawakaze, and her own sister Amagi. The table now held some pieces of twisted metal, a Sakuran naval officer cap, dog tags and what seemed to be wisdom cubes.

Akagi signaled to Helena, making a camera-like-motion, which made the Union cruiser take the hint immediately, she rushed and grabbed one of the digital cameras within the auditorium, devices prepared to record things on a much closer perspective, which was what Helena immediately did, getting into frame the table the Sakuran ladies were sitting at, focusing on the contents of it and in turn showing it on the giant screen in the auditorium.

‚ÄúThe Sacred Tree requested of me to recover these.‚Äù Akagi said as she signaled with her whole palm to the cap and dog tags on the table. ‚ÄúThese are real relics from the war of old, which were used to pull human souls from within ‚Äòthe cycle‚Äô.‚Äù

At this Yamashiro gasped audibly, and most of the ladies from the Sakuran Empire furrowed their brows deep in concern, everyone else in the room seemed rather confused in contrast to them. Although they mostly understood some of the mythos and religion of the Sakuran Empyre, everyone treated their religions as something personal that had no place within the war they were facing.

‚ÄúThese truly feel like relics!‚Äù Fusou said while inspecting the dog tags, the cap and the pieces of metal on the table. ‚ÄúThese are filled with energy and deep resentment, but‚Ä¶ not against humans‚Ä¶ these feel like great demons that somehow do not need to be exorcized‚Äù

‚ÄúIndeed.‚Äù Akagi replied to Fusou, looking intently at her, with the pink light from her eyes seeming to shine even more intensely for a second.

‚ÄúThe sacred tree showed me that these souls were on their way to become guardian spirits for the Sakuran people‚Äù Akagi said, her tone of voice had changed now, showing great reverence and a hint of sadness to it.

‚ÄúWe- We cannot exorcize them! Any sort of rite we could perform would most likely erase them!‚Äù Yamashiro complained almost in a squeak full of concern.

‚ÄúAnd we will not. They will continue their tribulations and their path‚Ä¶ in a different way‚Ä¶‚Äù Akagi said as she took the officer cap from the table.

She procured a red shikigami paper from the sleeve. She put it on top of the cap which was soon engulfed in pink flames as amagi held these with both hands in front of herself. The flames soon burned brighter and bigger, making everyone stand back a step, except for Akagi, Nagato, and Amagi. As the flames receded Akagi moved closer to her sister, as these disappeared the shape of the officer cap was again within sight, yet it looked somewhat smaller, and on top of something.

Everyone stood in awe as Akagi gently placed a feline-like figure on the table, although much closer to a doll with feline ears and tail, lustrous white hair coming from its head, dressed with what looked like a simple male kimono design from samurai novels, a weathered indigo blue with black pants. Wearing a hannya mask on its shoulder as if it was a pauldron, and a diminutive katana on his hip.

The small being resembled Akashi‚Äôs meowficers to a disquieting degree. With only a few striking differences besides the obvious stoic behavior of this new feline companion. The main differences being for starters, the two tails coming from the back of its attire, which were as striking as the solemn expression on its face. Upon being placed on the table it moved closer to Amagi and it bowed deeply just as Akagi bowed minutely towards her sister.

The meowfficer-like shikigami furrowed its brow as it stared at Amagi, without any warning at all it unsheathed its sword and pointed it slightly above Amagi. A pinkish flame appeared on the blade, it made a cutting motion and then swiftly sheathed its sword again in a very polished way which brought to mind the swordmasters of the Sakuran Empire.

Everyone but Amagi thought that it had been a cute and entertaining show. As for Amagi herself she was surprised as she immediately felt some of her aches disappear. It was so sudden to the point that she not only felt like sitting straight was a much simpler task, she felt compelled to look over her shoulder, figuring she would see the remains of some sort of being that might have been standing on her shoulders, adding weight and illnesses for her to carry.

When she looked back at her sister she saw an ample and content grin on the fiery Kitsune.

‚ÄúDear sister, this is Aoki-san, my very last and most devoted captain.‚Äù Akagi said as she introduced the spirit-bound meowfficer. ‚ÄúPlease take good care of each other.‚Äù",1,1733016931.0,AzureLane,0,1.0,False

Waerbeam is an old fortress, also known as the ‚Äúprotecting pillar.‚Äù

It was built by the Astreans, a nation that regained its independence thanks to disruptions caused by the Krux rebellion that allowed them to stage their own alongside three other powers.

The Astreans constructed Waerbeam to safeguard vital railroad networks: it was built before the advent of any shield and scrambler or laser tech, and as such the modernization was an attempt to bring it up to par with the modern battle fortress. Still, the pillar proved to be stubborn and would not yield to construction equipment aiming to install new shield generators. The engineers eventually gave up, slapped on some new energy weapons in place of old alastor and basilisk weapons, and gave the thing more defense turrets to make up for the lack of any other protective systems.",6,1733016901.0,REDCON,0,1.0,False

It is our responsibility as those who hold the power to alter the very timeline upon which our reality is based, to uphold certain principles. When all else has fallen to ruin, we may find solace in these rules based upon said principles:

One, those with knowledge of the future must never share their knowledge with those of the past.

Two, no one, aside from the two of us, may observe our powers at play, as to avoid any confusion among the general public, as well as ensure the safety of ourselves.

Three, in the twelve hours given to the traveler, all key events must remain untouched, as to avoid disturbing the flow of time and reality itself in the present.

To alter time is to tamper with the very fabric of reality. As moments in a timeline shift, every event after that will also be changed. To change an event is to change the entire timeline, thereby altering not only actions, but also the essence of being each person had in the present.

Chapter 1

The soft chime of the door echoed through the quiet shop, rousing me from my peaceful slumber. I hesitantly crack open an eyelid, still groggy, and glance up at the blurry figure entering. ‚ÄúWelcome, sir. What may I do for you?‚Äù I ask, my voice warping with a lingering yawn.

The man in the doorway, dressed in a dark suit and a black bowler hat with a peculiar green lining, removed his hat and stepped forward. ‚ÄúGood afternoon. I was wondering if you might be able to help me mail this letter. The public postal system has had such a breakdown lately, I worry it may never reach its intended destination.‚Äù

I nod, rubbing the remnants of sleep from my eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure we can help with that, sir.‚Äù

The man smiled warmly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad to hear it.‚Äù



‚ÄúThanks, come again soon!‚Äù I called out as the man turned toward the door. The bell chimed again as the man hesitated, turning to face me once more.

He looked down at a small, tattered envelope in his hands. Fidgeting with the seal he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if this is true or not, but I heard a rumor that this establishment offers‚Ä¶ other services concerning the past, using hand-written letters?‚Äù

I blink, suddenly more alert.¬† ‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs true,‚Äù I say slowly, my voice getting quieter. ‚ÄúIs there something you need help with?‚Äù

The man shifted uneasily, fidgeting with the letter in his hands. ‚ÄúWell, you see, a couple of years ago, a dear friend of mine asked me to deliver a message for him. Little did I know, that would be the last time I spoke to him. As for the person he intended the message for, I found they were‚Ä¶ well, quite unreachable.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnreachable as in‚Ä¶ deceased?‚Äù I ask gently, my brow furrowing.

The man nodded. ‚ÄúI still feel guilty. I wasn‚Äôt able to complete my friend‚Äôs dying wish. I heard your shop might be able to help me deliver his message to someone who‚Äôs passed away.‚Äù

My expression softens as I begin feeling pity for the man.¬† I take a step back, clasping my hands behind my head in thought. ‚ÄúSo you want to relay a message to someone who‚Äôs no longer alive.‚Äù I murmur, mostly to myself.

The man nodded, his eyes filling with a look of deep regret. ‚ÄúYes. It sounds absurd, I know. But I have to try. I just‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt live with myself knowing I didn‚Äôt do everything in my power to help my friend.‚Äù

My gaze shifted to the back of the shop, and I let out a long sigh. ‚ÄúI think we can help you with that, but it‚Äôs not a simple thing. There are rules to what we do. And the final decision on whether we can help is up to my partner.‚Äù

The man‚Äôs eyes lit up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm willing to do whatever it takes. Whatever you need. I just need this closure.‚Äù

I glance at the clock on the wall, my eyes flicking toward the back room. ‚ÄúAlright. Follow me Mr‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúHudson, Richard Hudson.‚Äù he says.

I lead Mr. Hudson down the narrow hallway and into a small, cluttered room at the back of the shop. Inside, William‚Äîor Liam, as everyone called him‚Äîsat at a desk, poring over an old journal.

*‚ÄúKnock Knock*? Liam, we have a visitor.‚Äù I say cheerily.

As he looked up from his notes, he smiled warmly at me and the man who had followed me into the room.¬†

‚ÄúHi, Lex,‚Äù Liam greeted, turning to the man, he added with a friendly smile, ‚ÄúAnd hello, sir. How may I assist you today?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was hoping you could help me deliver this letter,‚Äù he began, clearly nervous, ‚ÄúI... I need to deliver a message to someone who has passed away. I couldn‚Äôt do it when my friend asked me, and now I regret it.‚Äù

Liam listened intently, his expression steady and serious. Then, with a slow nod, he took the letter from Mr. Hudson‚Äôs hand. His fingertips brushed against the paper, and for a brief moment, the room seemed to grow quieter, as though Liam were listening for something deeper in the letter‚Äôs words.¬†

Watching Liam work was always fascinating to me. The flash that crossed his eyes when he began reading, and the look of intense focus displayed on his face as he grasped more information than anyone else could from a couple of pages. The whole process of sifting through all of that knowledge in seconds is incredible, and way beyond my comprehension.

‚ÄúI understand,‚Äù Liam said at last. He seemed to consider a few more moments before he placed the letter carefully on his desk, his eyes never leaving their client. ‚ÄúHowever, this is a delicate matter. Sending messages to the past is a serious task, and it‚Äôs not one we take lightly.‚Äù

Mr. Hudson‚Äôs face fell, but Liam held up a hand. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean to discourage you. We can help, but I must warn you‚Äîthere are limits to what we can do.‚Äù He glanced at me, as I continue standing silently by the door. ‚ÄúThe final decision is mine, but... Lex and I will work together on this. You‚Äôll have to trust us.‚Äù

Mr. Hudson nodded eagerly. ‚ÄúI trust you. Please, I just need to fulfill this promise.‚Äù

Liam nodded slowly, his expression calm. ‚ÄúI understand. But there are rules we follow. We cannot tell you how this works. You won‚Äôt know the details, and you mustn‚Äôt ask. It‚Äôs not for you to understand. We also can‚Äôt let anyone from the past know what we‚Äôre doing. No one can know about our abilities. If you do this, you‚Äôll need to accept that you can‚Äôt share any of this with anyone.‚Äù

I lean against the doorframe, smirking lightly at Liam‚Äôs tone. ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôre all about secrets around here,‚Äù I say with a wink, trying to lighten the mood. I gesture toward Liam. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the one who reads the letters, and I‚Äôm the one who does all the... *hands-on* work.‚Äù I say with a dramatic pose, flexing my ‚Äúmuscles‚Äù as an attempt at a joke.

Liam shoots me a quick look, feigning embarrassment, but the corners of his mouth betray him as they quirk upward into a half-smile. ‚ÄúAnd I trust Lex to do his job. But we can‚Äôt break the rules. Messing with the past is always a risk, and we can‚Äôt afford to change anything too drastically.‚Äù

Liam eyes me as I grin mischievously at Mr. Hudson. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not exactly known for being subtle, but when it comes to these things... I‚Äôve learned to be careful. We can‚Äôt mess with the big stuff.‚Äù

Liam‚Äôs smile faded slightly as he turned back to the man. ‚ÄúOnce we deliver the message, we can‚Äôt undo it. A letter can only be used once, but you have to trust us.‚Äù The man nodded, eyes full of hope and desperation. ‚ÄúI understand. I‚Äôll do whatever it takes. Please help me.‚Äù

Liam looked down at the letter again, as though contemplating the decision. ‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù he said, his voice steady. He turns to me as I make my way to the room in the very back of the shop.¬†

I turn around briefly to give him a small salute and a teasing grin. ‚ÄúAye, captain. You know I‚Äôm always ready for a little time-bending fun.‚Äù

Liam shot me a pointed look but couldn‚Äôt suppress a small smile. ‚ÄúJust stay focused, Lex.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlways,‚Äù I reply with an exaggerated wink before heading toward the back room.

Liam walked Mr. Hudson back to the front of the shop. He stood with the letter in his hand as he focused on the man who stood waiting at the counter. ‚ÄúPlease, leave this to us,‚Äù Liam said with a calm, reassuring smile. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll take care of it.‚Äù

The man nodded, grateful but understandably worried. Turning away with a hopeful smile, he exited the shop, the door chiming quietly as he left them to do their work.

As soon as the door clicked shut behind him, Liam walked back to the small room where he sat down across from me. I‚Äôm doing my best to prepare myself, my face scrunched up in concentration.

Liam set the letter on the table between us and spoke softly, his voice calm and controlled. *‚ÄúYou ready?*¬†

I nod ‚Äú*Let‚Äôs do this.‚Äù*

Without speaking, we stretch our arms out, laying our palms flat, one atop the other. The connection is immediate.¬†

*‚ÄúI‚Äôve read through the letter. You‚Äôre stepping into his shoes. Remember, you can‚Äôt share knowledge of the future, and don‚Äôt make any rash moves. Just deliver the message. No matter what happens, you can‚Äôt change things.‚Äù Liam‚Äôs thoughts rang clearly in my mind.*

*‚ÄúGot it. No frills, just the message. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù*¬†

And with that, the room around us seems to blur. Time begins to shift as I feel myself stepping into the writer‚Äôs skin, accompanied by Liam‚Äôs presence in my head.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

‚ÄúRichard! Richard! Hey, Richard! Come on upstairs, breakfast is just about ready!‚Äù A voice called from somewhere above me, muffled and distant.

I blink, trying to shake off the haze clouding my thoughts. ‚ÄúLiam, where am I?‚Äù I groaned, sitting up and scanning the dimly lit room around me. It looked like some sort of basement. My gaze fell on a letter on the floor, its ink still wet, the same one I must have used to get here.

*‚ÄúYou're in our client‚Äôs office. He comes down here to write and do paperwork for his business,‚Äù* Liam‚Äôs voice filled my head, calm and reassuring. *‚ÄúThis all happened 15 years ago.‚Äù*

I nodded, processing his words. The sound of his voice was comforting, a reminder that I wasn‚Äôt alone in this.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better get upstairs. Your wife will be mad if you don‚Äôt.‚Äù*

I scoffed, the idea of being married feeling foreign and strange. Then again, I had a role to play if I wanted to keep the timeline intact. I had to go along with it.

I stood and dusted myself off before heading up the stairs toward the voice. As I reached the top, I was greeted by an exasperated young woman.

‚ÄúThere you are! I was starting to think you might never emerge from that office of yours!‚Äù

She couldn‚Äôt be older than thirty, with bright green eyes and dark brown hair tied back in a loose bun. She looked at me with a mix of concern and affection.

*‚ÄúThis is Margaret,‚Äù* Liam‚Äôs voice confirmed in my head.

I forced a smile, trying to step into my role. ‚ÄúSorry, I was just finishing a letter for a friend.‚Äù

‚ÄúA friend?‚Äù Her brow furrowed slightly, curious.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ Bill,‚Äù I said, the name coming to me just in time.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she replied, nodding. ‚ÄúYou should go see him soon. I heard he‚Äôs been ill lately.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúDo you know which hospital he‚Äôs staying at?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs Montgomery,‚Äù she said, turning away.

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good idea,‚Äù* Liam added in my mind. *‚ÄúGo visit him after breakfast.‚Äù*

‚ÄúI‚Äôll do that,‚Äù I said, nodding at Margaret. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll head over right after breakfast.‚Äù

The kitchen was warm, the scent of coffee hanging in the air as Margaret moved around, setting the table. I sat down, feeling slightly like an intruder in a life that wasn‚Äôt mine. It all felt too... *casual*. The simple routines of a marriage I couldn‚Äôt imagine myself in.

Margaret placed a plate in front of me with a smile. ‚ÄúSo, how‚Äôs that letter to Bill coming along? Any progress?‚Äù

Bill. Right. I nodded, trying to recall what ‚ÄúBill‚Äù was even working on. ‚ÄúYeah, just wrapping things up. It‚Äôs been a bit of a hassle, but nothing too serious.‚Äù

Her smile lingered as she took her seat across from me, pouring herself more coffee. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre thinking of him. You‚Äôve always been good to your colleagues.‚Äù

I gave a half-smile, picking at my toast. My stomach turned as her fingers brushed the edge of my hand when she reached for the jam, the softness in her voice when she spoke my name.

I had to fight the urge to pull away. This... was not my life. So I *can‚Äôt* change the past just because this guy‚Äôs wife creeps me out.¬†

*‚ÄúRemember this isn‚Äôt your life, you just have to play the role until we can deliver the message‚Äù* Liam repeated in my head.

""So,"" she said, her green eyes glinting, ""what's on the agenda for today? More work, or will you actually take some time off for yourself?""

I blinked, searching for an answer. Something that felt natural. ""I‚Äôll head to the office later. After I check on Bill.""

Her smile brightened, ‚ÄúYou always take care of your friends. It‚Äôs one of the things I love about you.‚Äù

*Ugh.* I bit back the uncomfortable sigh. This wasn‚Äôt real. I wasn‚Äôt Richard. But I have to play along until we can deliver that message.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back soon,‚Äù I said, forcing a smile that probably looked more like a grimace. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll do something after, okay?‚Äù

She gave me a soft kiss on the cheek as she stood to clear the plates. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be waiting. Don‚Äôt take too long.‚Äù

*‚ÄúTalk about a ladies‚Äô man,‚Äù* Liam teased, his thoughts dripping with amusement as Margaret leaves the room.

I scowl, not in the mood for his jabs. ‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù I grumble. ‚ÄúHow would you feel getting all chummy with someone else‚Äôs wife?‚Äù I snap defensively, even though I know it‚Äôs a silly argument to have.

Liam scoffs in my head, unfazed. *‚ÄúYou* ***are*** *her husband, remember?‚Äù*

I roll my eyes, ‚ÄúYeah, yeah. *Whatever*,‚Äù I mutter, more to myself than to him.

‚ÄúAnyway,‚Äù I say, subtly steering the subject away from *that* awkward encounter, ‚Äúhow do I get to Montgomery Hospital? I don‚Äôt think that place even exists anymore.‚Äù

Liam‚Äôs voice is calm, patient. *‚ÄúIt exists in this timeline. And it just so happens to be walking distance from your house.‚Äù*

I let out an exaggerated sigh, sarcasm thick in my tone. ‚ÄúYay! Lucky me,‚Äù I mutter.



\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

After what felt like the most stressful walk of my life (courtesy of Liam‚Äôs horrible sense of direction), I finally arrived at the hospital. The building was massive‚Äî12 stories tall and spanning two entire blocks.

I found my way to the entrance and approached the reception desk.

""Excuse me, ma'am,"" I said, plastering on what I hoped was a cheerful smile, ""I was hoping to visit a dear friend of mine, Mr. Bill Thompson?""

The nurse smiled kindly. ""Of course, sir. You can find him in room 424.""

""Thanks,"" I nod politely and make my way to the elevators.

After a bit of confusion and a few wrong turns, I finally find myself standing outside room 424.

*""Relax,""* Liam's voice echoed in my mind, soft and reassuring. *""Just talk to him like you talk to me.""*

I take a deep breath and enter the room.

The sight of Bill takes me by surprise. Though I knew he was around the same age as Richard, he looked years older‚Äîhis skin pale and sunken, lips cracked, his frame thin and frail. That‚Äôs when the gravity of the situation truly hit me. This might be Richard's last conversation with his best friend.

""Hey, Richard,"" Bill greeted me warmly, though his voice was raspy and hoarse.

""Hey, Bill,"" I replied, swallowing the lump in my throat. ""How‚Äôve you been?""

Bill chuckled lightly, though it sounded more like a wheeze as he gestured to the array of tubes running into his body. ""As good as I can, given... well, this.""

""I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt come sooner,"" I said, guilt twisting in my stomach, ""I didn‚Äôt know it had gotten this bad.""

Bill shook his head, his eyes filled with a weary understanding. ""It‚Äôs okay, Richard. I was diagnosed three years ago. I‚Äôve known for a while now I wouldn‚Äôt make it past thirty-five.""

Liam‚Äôs voice cut through my thoughts, calm and steady. *""I know it‚Äôs hard, but we can‚Äôt afford to let emotions get in the way. Focus. We can‚Äôt alter the timeline.""*

I nodded subtly to myself, pushing the weight of the situation aside for the moment. ""How much time do they think you‚Äôve got left?""

""One week,"" Bill answered quietly, his voice surprisingly calm. Then, after a long pause, he added, ""Richard, I need you to do something for me. A final request.""

I stayed quiet, waiting.

""I need you to go see my daughter. Victoria.""

My brow furrowed in confusion. ""Victoria?""

Bill nodded, a sad, resigned smile on his lips. ""Yes. She... she stopped speaking to me after I refused to give my blessing for her marriage. It‚Äôs been a long time since we‚Äôve spoken, and I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll listen to me anymore. But I... I trust you, Richard. You‚Äôre my closest friend, and I know you can do this for me.""

I blinked in surprise, the request settling in my mind. ""You want *me* to see her? After everything that‚Äôs happened?""

Bill‚Äôs smile faded as he closed his eyes for a moment. ""I know it‚Äôs a lot to ask. But I‚Äôve tried everything, and I‚Äôve failed her. I won‚Äôt get the chance to fix this myself. I need you to tell her why I did what I did. She needs to know it wasn‚Äôt about control, Richard.‚Äù The frail man looked up at his friend, tears welling up in his eyes, ‚ÄúIt was about protecting her. I just... I need her to know that.""

His voice cracked slightly as he spoke, and despite the unfamiliarity of his situation, a heavy wave of sympathy washed over me. I felt the weight of his plea and heard the desperation in the dying man‚Äôs voice.

""I‚Äôll find her,"" I said, my voice steady even though my mind was racing. ""I‚Äôll tell her. I‚Äôll make sure she knows what you wanted her to hear.""

Bill‚Äôs eyes softened, and he squeezed my hand weakly. ""Thank you, Richard. I know you can do this. Please... don‚Äôt let my mistakes be the last thing she remembers of me.""

I nodded, my throat tight. ""I won‚Äôt. I‚Äôll make sure she understands.""

As I stepped into the hallway, I felt the weight of the task ahead settle in. The gravity of Bill‚Äôs request was hanging over me, and I wasn‚Äôt sure where to start looking for Victoria, or if she would even listen. But I have no choice. I have to do this for Bill, and for Richard.

Just as I begin walking down the hallway, a voice echoes inside my mind, familiar and reassuring, *""We‚Äôll find her, Lex. Stay focused. You‚Äôre not alone.""*

¬†

May and Freddy arrive in a ghost town. They look around at the swinging double doors and the sign that says whiskey five cents. Looking around the western town, Freddy doesn‚Äôt see anyone or anything that could help them. He tells May to look for freshwater while he looks for food. ""We should have brought food when we came into this world, but I was in a rush, so here we are,"" said Freddy. May finds a water pump, but it's dry. With the hot sun beating down on her, she is forced to find a place to take cover from the heat. Freddy finds bottles filled with water. The old milk bottles are filled to the top with water, and Freddy opens one of the bottles. He drinks cool, refreshing water it tastes like spring water. Freddy goes to search for May. The town is only as big as your average old west town, and yet, as he searches from building to building, Freddy can't find her anywhere. In the doctor's office, he finds food: Bread and cheese with some grapes and a nice bottle of wine. Freddy can't believe his luck. A voice from overhead comes over a P.A. System. The voice welcomes Freddy to the war world and congratulates him on making it to this place in one piece. ""Many have tried to make it to war world.

Few have survived the trip, even with magic. We see you have a magic staff allowing you to travel to any world you want. Currently, we are blocking its abilities to keep you from exiting before the great games,"" said the voice.

Freddy understands that whoever these people are, they have taken May and are keeping her somewhere. Freddy yells for the voice to answer him and tell him where May is being held. The voice comes over the P.A. Once again and says. ""This season, the great games will be a scavenger hunt. You will find clues that lead you to your missing friend. Each one is hidden somewhere in the Multiverse, and when the games begin in just a few moments, it will be up to you to find your friend,"" said the voice. After the voice stops talking, Freddy gathers up all the water and food he can and uses his cane to create a magic backpack to hold all the food and water he can gather together. Appearing before him in the ghost town are 12 wizards and witches and Kronos with a large golden gem replacing his missing eye. Kronos wants to attack Freddy, but a voice comes over the P.A. system and tells everyone that if they attempt to kill their fellow competitors, they will be put to death and have their loved ones killed. Freddy can guess which loved one they took from Kronos, and as he only has one person he cares about in his life, the big elf man looks at Freddy with a murderous look, grinds his teeth and snaps twigs. Freddy decides to talk with a few of the wizards, hoping to ally with one of them wizards.

Fat Albert, who looks like Hagrid with a much bigger belly and huge bell pepper nose, asks Freddy if he has anything to eat. Pulling out a duck and venison salami, Freddy offers it to the man, and he takes a big bite out of the salty, dry meat stick. Fat Albert eats half the salami and returns it to Freddy, thanking him for the food. Freddy asks Albert if he wants to work together and form an alliance. ""I'm already in an Alliance. Sorry, my boy, most people here are part of an alliance, everyone except that big man there with the glass eye,"" said Fat Albert. With all the wizards paired off, Freddy is forced to ask Kronos if he'll join in alliance with him. ""You wish to ally yourself with me?"" asked Kronos, laughing. He tells Freddy that he wouldn't work with him if his life depended on it and that when all this is done, he will rescue his sister and then take her back to his world and buttfuck him with the staff of power he stole. As the clock runs to zero, the ground under everyone's feet disappears, and Freddy, Kronos, and the wizards fall into blackness until they reach the ground.

Waking up, Freddy finds himself in an ancient Greek Agora. The huge gathering place is full of men and women who look at Freddy's strange outfit and whisper about him. Freddy steals some clothes off a clothesline and heads far from the Agora to change into his new clothes. Freddy looks around the Greek city and sees Fat Albert and a few other wizards walking around the city. Hoping not to be seen, Freddy uses his staff, now a walking stick with a golden gem in the center. The wizards search for something, but Freddy doesn‚Äôt know what they are looking for. Freddy decides to follow them, and he is grabbed from behind as he walks. As he looks up at the man holding him still, Freddy sees Kronos holding a knife to his throat. ""I should kill you for everything you put me through, but I can't save my sister alone, so you're going to help me,"" said Kronos. He helps Freddy to his feet and tells him to stop following Fat Albert's group because they are going the wrong way. ""We need to find the door to the next world, and once we find that, we can continue the search,"" said Kronos.

Walking around the city, Freddy and Kronos see a bunch of Persian ships. The ships were originally Greek but adopted by the Persians and are called Triremes. Kronos looks at one of the ships and sees a blue, glowing light coming from the ship. He tells Freddy that the light they are looking at is the door to the next world. The Greeks are running in terror as the Persians dock their ships and begin attacking the beach. Freddy doesn‚Äôt know what Greek city they are in, but he knows what period they are in, as the sack of Greece happened after the battle of Thermopylae. As the Persians storm the beach, Greek soldiers in a phalanx are overwhelmed by men with masks made of Onyx and bodies shrouded in a living shadow that seems to swallow the light as the soldiers move up the beach. The men carry obsidian Spears and slings; they do not use shields, but as the Persian officers unload wild animals and giant 8 ft tall men with their skin scared and covered in boils, the Persian army begins to take shape. Freddy, who was certain he knew what battle these men had come from, is now less certain as he doesn‚Äôt remember to shadow soldiers or rhinos with Pierced horns in the battle of Thermopylae. ""I think we're in another world with magic and demons,"" said Freddy.

""What was your first clue?"" said Kronos, laughing at him. Freddy explains that he thought that, for a moment, they were in the human world, and he believed he knew what would happen. ""So, what's going to happen?"" asked Kronos. Freddy explains that he doesn‚Äôt know what will happen in this world, but if it's based on the history of his world, the Greeks should be setting a trap for the Persians to get ready to destroy their ships. ""We can't let their flagship get destroyed. It's our only way out of this mess. We can help the Persians avoid the trap if we work together,"" said Kronos. ""Help the Persians. They want to burn Greece to ashes. We must help the Greeks and try to capture the Persian flagship simultaneously,"" said Freddy. Kronos isn't easy to convince. He reminds Freddy that if they let the Greeks destroy the Persian ships, they'll be trapped in the Greek world forever without a way home. ""And if you think I'm going to let you destroy my world with indifference, you are out of your mind,"" says Kronos. Freddy tells Kronos that if he agrees to help him save May and help her find a new world where she can live in peace, he'll willingly give up his life and help them summon their god. The two men agree and decide to help the Greeks. Kronos goes to speak with the leader of the Greek army, a scrawny man named Plato. Plato tells Kronos that he isn't looking for help right now. He and his men must hold the beach and ensure the Persians are pushed back into the sea. Freddy and Kronos offer the Greek General wine, telling him he can't fight Persians sober. General Plato agrees to join them for a drink. He follows the two men for a while and is never seen again. Kronos takes the dead General's clothes and Armor and heads to the beach. Finding the Greek army in disarray, Kronos and Freddy take command.

They order their 200 men to form ranks. The Persians have stopped attacking and are now torturing the Greeks, who fell to their first wave of attacks. Kronos orders his men to head farther inland to lead the Persians into a trap and take their ships so they cannot retreat. The Greeks look more like Geeks as they are scrawny and short. Their armor barely fits them, and looking at them, Kronos can see the fear in their eyes. Kronos orders Freddy to take half their men and lead the enemy into the Agora. Freddy leads the Greek Nerds to the beach, where they confront the enemy. The Persian Shadow soldiers charge at Freddy and his men. Using his walking stick, Freddy creates a shield made of solid energy. As the Persian soldiers collide with the shield, they burn away. The shadow men collide with the shield, trying to overrun it, but it holds strong.

After a few minutes of trying to overrun the shield, the shadow men retreat to their camps, allowing Freddy's men to help the injured and rescue the captured soldiers who were taken during the beach storming. The Persian commanders sent their Alchemists and rhinos to attack the Greeks. Knowing the first charging rhino will mow down his men, Freddy uses his staff to create sand holes on the beach to trap the rhinos. The gray-skinned beasts fall into the holes and are covered in sand by Freddy's magic. The Alchemists fare no better as many fall into these sand traps, and those that don‚Äôt are cut to pieces by the emboldened Greeks. A few Alchemists can fire their clay pots filled with Greek fire.

A few of the Greeks catch fire, but they stand strong, refusing to yield. Freddy leads his men to the Agora, with the Persians not too far behind. As the Persian army falls on Freddy and his now 500 men, he slams his staff down on the ground, sending out a shockwave and obliterating two rows of Persian shadow soldiers. The rest of them charge at Freddy while he is disoriented, slamming his staff into the ground. Freddy watches as dozens of shadow soldiers are destroyed in smoke and flames. The Persians don't scream or cry out in pain as they die. They drop their masks and turn to dust. Freddy can't believe they would give their lives this way, but as they keep coming and the shield weakens, Freddy begins to think of a plan. Grabbing his staff with both hands, Freddy pulls his staff out of the ground and shoots a huge beam of bright glowing light into the shadows, burning them as he turns in a complete circle, burning away the skin of some of his men. Freddy looks around and sees he has evaporated everything in a 300-yard radius, leaving only Char marks on the ground.

While Freddy distracts the Persians, Kronos takes his men and prepares to take the Persian flagship. He and his 100 men go to the beach, where they see the signs of a battle. Kronos and his men make their way to the rowboats so they can row to the Persian flagship. Kronos and his men fight to the enemy ships. Kronos orders his men to take the three ships Anchored alongside the flagship. The flagship's captain is the Persian general Cyrus, the big barrel-chested man with his heavy beard and head wrapped under his helmet. The man cuts an intimidating figure with his giant two-handed sickle sword slung over his shoulder. As Kronos reaches the flagship, he spots Cyrus climbing. He hides in the darkness and waits until Cyrus goes down below deck so he can look for the door.

With no one on the upper deck of the ship, Kronos can search for the door he looks for in the Captain's Quarters. Inside the quarters, Kronos finds maps and a pitcher of water filled with gold coins and diamonds. Kronos doesn‚Äôt know what to do as he looks for the door out of that world. Fat Albert and his men mount the ship and begin talking about what happened in the Agora as he looks for a way out of that world. ""Can you believe that guy destroyed the Persian army with his walking stick? I can't believe it,"" said Albert. Kronos uses the magic in his gem eye to summon Freddy to his side. Freddy isn't sure how he got to the ship, but he's glad to be there before Kronos leaves. ""So, you're not going to abandon me here?"" asked Freddy. ""Be quiet. We have guests. Let's find the door and get out of here before anyone sees us,"" said Kronos. ""Now help me find the door to the next world if you don't mind,"" he said. As they search the room, General Cyrus returns above deck and finds Fat Albert and his men standing on his ship. The man is enraged as Albert casts a spell on the General.

Cyrus can deflect the magical lightning bolt back at Fat Albert using his two-handed sickle sword. The bolt goes through the man, killing him, and Albert's friends attack General Cyrus, who issues a command to his men. As shadows gather overhead, the Persian soldiers descend from the sky and land on top of Albert's men. One of his men, a woman called Yoyo, casts a spell on the shadows. As they begin to take human form, the shadows seem immune to her magic, and as the rest of the Persian shadow soldiers take form, Cyrus retreats to the Captain's Quarters to find Kronos and Freddy in there. Cyrus tosses Freddy out of the Quarters into the middle of the melee in the middle of the ship. Kronos and Cyrus do battle in the Captain's Quarters. The two men fight to the death, destroying everything not bolted to the ground. Cyrus kicks Kronos out of the Captain's Quarters and into the brawl. Looking around, Kronos sees Freddy fighting with shadow soldiers while a group of wizards cast spells around the ship.

One of the wizards has his back to Kronos, and he's charging up a spell to attack Freddy, the wizard black of skin and bald with a scar running down the top of his head. The man's nose is two shades lighter than the rest, making him look like a mismatched scarecrow. Kronos shoves his axe into the man's back, splitting him open a little, and as he falls, the man unleashes a fireball at the mast of the ship, setting the sails on fire. As the ship catches fire, Freddy and Kronos stand back-to-back and attack the shadow soldiers as they descend on them. One of the shadows enters Kronos's mouth and begins to choke him from the inside.

Freddy, seeing this, slams his staff down on the ground, creating an energy shield to protect himself and Kronos. The shadows inside the shield are burned to ashes, and Kronos, who is choking to death, tries to talk but cannot speak. Freddy tells Kronos to use the power of his eye gem to expel the shadow monster. As the gem in his eye begins to glow, Kronos forces the shadow out of his body, which is burned to a crisp. The two men sit in their shields, watching the shadow soldiers and the wizard‚Äôs clash. The two groups hit each other with everything they have. One of the wizards, a big, muscly man named Tony Chopper, launches a massive fireball at the ship, causing the ship to sink. The ship goes down as it begins to take on water. General Cyrus and his shadow soldiers abandon the ship. With the ship going down and three of their men dead, the wizards race to find the exit. Kronos and Freddy block the door to the Captain's Quarters, and the two groups square off for a fight. With the ship sinking around them, Freddy and Kronos want to end this fight quickly. Freddy fires his staff, which shoots a beam of energy at Yoyo, hitting her in the chest and tearing off her shirt and huge chunks of her flesh.¬†

One of the wizards, a man who looks like Gandalf the Gray, cuts off one of Freddy's hands with a beam of magic light from his staff. Kronos uses the magic from his eye gem to heal Freddy's injury. As the ship goes under the water, Freddy and Kronos hold their breaths, and the wizards‚Äô cast spells of underwater breathing. The three wizards swim toward Freddy and Kronos, and Freddy, thinking, quickly slams his staff on the deck of the ship and parts the waves; the wizards, who still have a spell of underwater breathing cast, struggle to breathe outside the water as they are choking Freddy yells for Kronos to find the door so they can escape. Kronos begins pushing things out of the way until he finds a painting with a blue glow behind a small table. The painting is of a door, and the blue glow is coming from behind the door. Kronos yells for Freddy to follow him, and as he cuts into the painting, a door appears in front of him. The two men walk through the door and escape the Greek world, leaving Fat Albert's men behind to die.

Fear of a Black Planet

¬†

Freddy and Kronos arrive in the next world, and they find themselves surrounded by African-inspired clothing. The women wear Zulu basket hats, and the men have round stones through their lips. The men wear a combination of African Embroidery Shirts and wool shawls. A few men in cloth robes approach Freddy and laugh at his strange attire. Freddy and Kronos still wear the clothing of the Greek soldiers, and as they strip down to their underwear, the two men look around and see flying cars and skyscrapers. The beautiful African city is interwoven with the modern city as black men and women walk up and down the street. A police officer in a flying car wearing a wool shawl with a walking stick in his right hand tells Freddy and Kronos to stay where they are. The two men are standing in their underwear, trying to explain that they are not from here, but the officer slams his walking stick on the ground, and a wave of electricity shocks the two men until they collapse, clutching their chests, crying. The officer says something in Africa, and two robots that look like Chappie come and apprehend them. They are placed inside the flying car, and the officer flies them to the police station. Freddy, sick from getting shocked, begins to dry heave until the officer pulls him out of the car. ""What's wrong with you, boy?"" asked the officer. ""I feel sick,"" said Freddy, headbutting the officer in the face. He grabbed his staff and ran, leaving Kronos in the officer's custody. Kronos demands that Freddy come back and rescue him, but the little man is gone. He flees down the street and disappears. Kronos is taken to the police station, where he is strip-searched and forced to change into a cloth robe and stand in a cell with laser bars. Kronos's eye won't respond to his commands as it is cracked and must heal, the robots bring Kronos his food, a PB&J on soggy bread. As he sits in his cell eating his soggy sandwich, Kronos wants to kill Freddy for leaving him to be arrested. On the streets, Freddy is wandering around disoriented. Men and women move aside, trying to avoid this man before he gets sick of them.

Freddy vomits in an alleyway, and a bunch of little robots come crawling out of his vomit. The little robots are nanobots. As the vomit begins to disappear, Freddy starts to feel better. He waits until his stomach settles and then searches for the door. As he walks the streets, Freddy sees someone who looks like May. She is wearing a fine African-inspired dress with a Zulu hat and wrap skirt. Freddy follows the woman and finds her heading to a Greek-style Amphitheater. The outside of the Amphitheatre is a Colossal Ruin. While the inside has men jousting on flying robot horses, the men use energy lances to dual, and as they collide, one of the two men is knocked off his robot horse and falls to his death. Freddy looks for the girl who looks like May in the huge crowd.

As he looks around, a woman pulls him out of the way of a falling jouster looking at the woman's face. Freddy is surprised to see that it is May. ""What the hell are you doing here?"" asked May. ""We need to get out of here. These people are dangerous,"" said Freddy. ""But these are our people. This world is different from any other world. It's one where black people are treated like Kings,"" said May. Freddy begins to think about the kind of world May came from, the segregation and hate she's seen in her world. This world must be Paradise. How can he take all this away from her? ""I'm glad you're happy,"" he tells her, kissing her on the forehead and leaving. May stares at him, wondering where he's going, but Freddy doesn't turn around. He keeps walking. As he reaches the police station, Freddy has made a decision. He thinks about everything that's happened because he ran from Kronos and his men. He thinks about the wizard Olaf and what he'll do now that he is free.

Using his staff, Freddy encircles himself in an energy ball, smashing the doors open with blunt force. As he mows down a police officer with his energy ball of death, Freddy makes his way to the cell where they keep Kronos. The inmates inside their cells yell and holler as Freddy passes them by in his energy ball. With his new hand made of stone, Freddy can see using vibrations. Placing his stone hand on the ground, he feels where Kronos is being held. Using his stone hand, which can bend and take many shapes, Freddy creates a battering ram with his fist and breaks down the door to the secluded wing of the jail. Inside, Freddy sees Kronos being Released with an apology for their mistake. As the guards see Freddy in his rolling death ball, they begin shooting at him.

Freddy grabs Kronos and pulls him into his death ball. The two men flee the police station amid gunfire and three flashbangs. As the two men roll into the streets blind, Kronos demands to know what Freddy is thinking, leaving him behind and breaking into the police station to rescue him. ""I understand what I did was stupid, but I'd like to think that you might appreciate the danger I put myself in for you,"" said Freddy. Rolling down the street, Freddy and Kronos are followed by a drone. The sleek black plane follows the glowing yellow ball until Freddy can see it again. He uses the staff to make himself invisible, and as he disappears from the drone's sight, the plane, unsure of what just happened, crashes into a floating building. An energy shield protects the building, and the drone is destroyed, but as he watches from the shadows, Freddy and Kronos, who are starting to get his vision back, watch as police cars descend on the building.

Using his cane, Freddy gives himself and Kronos some new clothes before they leave the alleyway. Kronos keeps his face hidden from the crowd as he walks, and as they pass by a shop selling TVs, an image of them appears on the TV. Freddy walks up to a hotel, unsure how to reach the floating hotel as he is on the ground. Seeing a man hail a cab and use the cab to get to a building, Freddy grabs Kronos by the arm and pulls him toward a taxi stand. After getting in the cab, Freddy and Kronos point to the hotel. The cab driver tells them to hang on, and he flies to the hotel. Kronos becomes sick from air travel. The cab driver gives the two men a weird look, and Freddy explains that his friend has food poisoning. ""You should take him to see a doctor. What's the point of free health care if you have to suffer Instead of getting help,"" said the cab driver.¬†¬†

¬†

As the cab reaches the hotel, Freddy pulls Kronos out of the cab and into the hotel. Kronos, suffering from motion sickness, begins to feel better until he looks down and sees the streets some 500 ft below him. Vomiting over the side of the railing that protects the people around the floating buildings, Kronos throws up into a crowd of people who look up and yell at him. Freddy and Kronos enter the hotel and ask for a room. They are told they can stay for as long as a month if they'd like, and the two men thank the desk clerk and grab a key. Heading upstairs in a hyper lift, a round circular disk on the hotel's ground floor carries them to their room and is surrounded by an energy shield until they reach the 30th floor. After getting off the hyper lift, Freddy and Kronos enter their room. The room looks something like the captain's quarters in Star Trek. Freddy sees something that looks like a Star Trek replicator. He pushes the only button on the machine and asks for a coffee. The replicator makes a black coffee with cream and two sugars.

As if the replicator read his mind, the machine puts the coffee in a Starbucks cup and offers him some crackers for his drink. Freddy enjoys his drink and eats the nice, sweet crackers with chocolate on the bottom and a drizzle of raspberry ganache. While Kronos sleeps, Freddy fills up on these crackers waking up. Kronos turns on the TV and asks to see the news. TV turns into the most popular A + B news network. As he looks at the news, he sees the woman anchor is both topless and bald. Her head is full of tattoos, and she speaks with an Australian accent. The woman, Cindy Lu, reports that Two escaped convicts are on the run from the police and need to be caught as soon as possible. ""TURN OFF THAT DAM TV BEFORE SOMEONE HEARS IT,"" said Freddy. ""Switch to cartoons or something,"" he said, gesturing at Kronos to switch the channel. Kronos orders the TV to turn itself off, and after that, he goes to the window and sees the police raiding a crack house. As they drag men and women out of the burned-out building into the light, Kronos wonders what they seek. ""They're looking for us, don't you get it? They want to find us and think we're hiding in crack dens and halfway houses,"" said Freddy. Kronos doesn‚Äôt know what a halfway house or crack house is, and when he asks, Freddy explains that it's where people go to get high. ""You know, fry their brains and smoke dope,"" said Freddy. ""And after they've fried their brains, do they eat the brains or feed them to someone else?"" asked Kronos. Freddy has a headache from trying to explain drugs to Kronos, and instead, he decides to show him what drugs are. He turns on a movie where the main character is a drug addict, and after watching the man inject himself with some purple drug, Kronos begins to understand. ""So, these people are just Hop heads that we call men who use a drug called Hop. It affects the mind and makes you have visions. My brother was killed by a Hop's head while coming home from working at the lumber camp. The two of them exchange stories about how drugs have affected their lives, and Freddy is shocked to learn that after his brother's death, Kronos hunted down the Hop head, which killed him and bashed his skull in with a Warhammer. After that, he began using drugs, not Hop, but other things, potions like white sand, to dull the pain of living in a world without his brother.

Kronos explains that Titan was his older brother, and when he was born, his older brother would bring him fresh milk from their family cow every day, even though it would make him late for school. Kronos begins to cry as he thinks about this memory. He tells Freddy that his brother Titan is why he became an elf ranger and adventurer along with his sister. He explains that when he was 12, his mother and father planned to send him away for an apprenticeship to a ship‚Äôs captain. Kronos explains that when his brother found out, he asked an old former adventurer in their town to take him under his wing. Kronos explains that for almost ten years, he didn‚Äôt see his brother until he became a full-fledged adventurer, and once he and his sister gained the rank of adventurer, he came home to see his brother and discovered that not only was his brother married but he had three children two girls and a boy. ‚ÄúI feel bad for my nephew trapped in a house full of women, but I do this for my brother.

I must ensure his family survives the coming end of days,"" said Kronos. Freddy understands Kronos a little better now that he understands his desire to do whatever it takes to save his world as he is saving the world and the people he cares for. Freddy was certain Kronos had a personal reason to kill him, but he never thought it was this personal. After talking, Freddy Asks Kronos how he found the door to the Greek world. Kronos explains that it will start to glow when you get close to the door. ""The most important thing is that the door will most likely find you. You'll be pulled toward the door in most cases,"" said Kronos. Freddy begins to think about where the door could be. He also wonders why no one else came with them to this world. Freddy wonders if maybe everyone else is dead and they are the last ones standing. But he thinks if that were the case, why wouldn't they have been sent home?¬†

After a week of searching for the door to the next world, Freddy decides to give up. Kronos reminds him that his sister's life is on the line, and no one is quitting before they find Shireen. ""My sister's life is on the line. You and I will not quit until she is safe, understand?"" said Kronos. ""We will battle with whoever we must ensure Shireen's life,"" said Kronos. Interpol wants Kronos for the crime of attacking the police station with an energy weapon, the likes of which no one in the country of Africana. The country on a map looks like Africana makes up most of North America and South America, with only slight areas outside of African control. Freddy asks how far from the door they could have been dumped by the last portal, and Kronos tells him that his father would take him to watch the great games when he was little, and one thing he learned about the games is that the games master would either put the doors very far away to force the competitors to get into fights with each other and the people of whatever world they are on. ""But in some cases, they've been known to put the door somewhere close by so everyone passes right by it and will never find their way off the world they're trapped in,"" said Kronos. Freddy is concerned with the reality that his life is just a game to these people, the game makers, and as he thinks about a way to find the door it comes to him, he could ask May if she knows where the door is hidden. Freddy tells Kronos to stay at the hotel while he goes to talk to May. ""What if she won't tell you where the door is or if she sets you up?"" asked Kronos. ""She‚Äôs, my friend. We've been through a lot, and I trust her with my life and yours,"" said Freddy. After talking, Freddy and Kronos go their separate ways. Freddy finds May, and Kronos returns to their room and eats some free peanuts from the minibar.

Freddy calls the number that May gave him to use if he wants to contact her, and he calls and asks if she can meet him somewhere private. ""Come to Mama's diner on Lexington Avenue, and we'll talk. If you can't find it, call a cab. They're free, after all,"" said May. Freddy hails a cab, and as it arrives, he asks the cab driver to take him to Mama's diner on Lexington Avenue. The driver brings him to a 50s-style diner. Looking in the window, Freddy sees May talking to someone. The man is tall, black and bony. He smokes a cigarette and keeps his eyes on the door. Freddy becomes concerned with how that man looks toward the door as he walks past the diner. May notices and points him out. The man with the cigarette chases after Freddy. He even radios for backup. As he runs through the streets, Freddy is pursued by the bony man with his cigarette between his fingers. He calls out to someone, and Freddy is dragged into an unmarked flying van. Having been taken off the streets in broad daylight, Freddy tells whoever took him that they'll be in big trouble if they don't let him go. One of the men who took him removes the sack from around his head and knocks him out with one punch. The big dark-skinned man appears Middle Eastern by the look of him, and his face is the last thing Freddy sees before he passes out. Waking up a few hours later, Freddy smells salt and onions.

As he looks around, he sees a big Slavic man with a round belly and a white tank top barely covering his chest. The man is cooking liver and onions with some Russian cream sauce. He turns to Freddy and says, ""The little man is awake, Marco. Philp, come quick,"" said the big Slavic man: two men, the Middle Eastern man and the man with the Cigarette. ""Hello, I'm Philp Fry, and this is Marco. He won't tell anyone his last name, and we won't ask,"" said Philp. May walks into the room, and Freddy won't even look at her; instead, he turns his attention to the man in front of him. ""What do you want from me, Mr. Fry?"" asked Freddy.

""That's a good question. I'd like you to explain how you destroyed part of a jail using only a staff?"" asked Philp. Freddy looks May up and down and says. ""It seems you already know how and why I did everything.""¬† ""The why doesn‚Äôt matter to us. We want to know how you see. I can't seem to make this stuff work, and I'd like you to tell me how to make it work,"" said Philp. Freddy explains that he is the only one who can make the staff work because it belongs to him. ""So, if we kill you, we can claim its power for ourselves?"" asked the Slavic man.

""No, that's not how it works,"" said Freddy, fearing they might kill him anyway just to try it out. May, whom Freddy has tried his hardest to ignore, asks him why he asked to meet with her, and after a few minutes of him missing her, she begins to tell him what she thinks. ""You came to ask about the magic that brought me here. I saw a way out of here, and I'll tell you where it is if you agree to help me and my friends with our mission. What do you say?"" asked May. ""Where's the door, May?"" asked Freddy. May agrees to tell Freddy where the door is, but only if he'll help them. ""Help you with what?"" asked Freddy. May explains that this world is far from perfect as the people of Africana sell people from other countries into slavery back in the motherland.

""My friends and I want to disrupt a shipment headed for Africa. It's full of Greek and Honduran slaves. If you help us, I'll tell you where the door is,"" said May. Freddy agrees to help but tells May she'll need to send someone to get his friend Kronos, who is in a hotel called the Maverick. Freddy waits for an hour, and once his friend arrives, the group plans to attack the shipping yard where the slaves are being shipped from. Freddy and Kronos devise the plan while Philp and his men prepare for their attack. Freddy and Kronos attack the shipping yard as the ship prepares to sail. They destroy the ship with an explosive blast from Freddy's staff. As the ship sinks, the crew begins to disembark. Kronos goes to work, killing the crew. He slaughters men and women as they run off the ship, cutting them to pieces with his great axe. While Freddy and Kronos deal with the crew and ship, Philp, May, and Marcos are freeing the slaves. They plant hacking nano bugs on each of the cells, and the doors swing open, letting the naked men and women run free into the streets. An overseer tries to stop a group of slaves from escaping, and May fires her bow at the man, hitting him in the throat and saving the slaves. Another overseer cuts May's throat and rips her bow away, throwing it into the ocean. Freddy runs to her as she lies dying. He tries to use his magic to heal her, but she's lost too much blood. Before she dies, she whispers where the door is, and she asks him to help the people escape from Africana to the free lands. Freddy orders the frightened slaves to jump into the water.

He then creates boats using his staff, and as the people climb into the boats to escape, Freddy grabs Kronos and tells him he knows where the door is. The two men go to the police station, covered in blood. The two of them are a sight walking down the street. As they enter the police station, an officer tells them to get on the ground and put their hands in the air. Freddy smashes his staff into the officer's face, breaking his nose and spilling blood all over them. The two men tare through the police station until they reach the chief's office. There, they find the chief, a fat black man who looks like a grey-haired Danny Glover. Kronos and Freddy lock themselves in the chief's office as the police regroup. Kronos orders the chief down on the ground while he looks around his office. The chief, who is crying, does as he's told. Freddy and Kronos look for the door. As the police are about to break down the door, Freddy finds a child's toy, and the toy is a jack-in-the-box with doors painted on it. As he turns the crank until he and Kronos are sucked into a portal and disappear.

Freddy and Kronos open their eyes to find themselves back in Fantasma. As they look around, they see they are in an arena, and the surviving wizards are being portrayed all around them. The men and women of Fantasma are cheering and celebrating as the participants are portal into the arena. One of the wizards uses his magic to summon a massive great axe. Another conjures a bald, one-eyed giant in cloth pants with a club. The giant stands about 20 feet tall, and as the rest of the 12 wizards summon shadow cats and giant bats to fight for them, Freddy decides to summon a tower in the center of the arena so he and Kronos can watch the chaos unfold. As the two men stand on top of the giant tower, they can see the top of the giant's head.

I have a HUGE crush on a girl who I went to elementary school with. We didnt go to school together afterwards but its been about ten years since I haven‚Äôt seen her until the first day of September (a month ago). We are both 20, and I really wanted to find her again and talk to her. Back in elementary I did found out where she lived which is literally 2 minutes away from my house. (I had seen her going into her apartment and waved hi) I didnt know if she still lived there all this time but I didnt want to go and see but just to find her insta. I had found her instagram and after a couple months I messaged her. (After having the confidence to dm her) This is one of the important parts to my story. While im messaging her and when I was trying to find her Instagram, i had also found a few other classmates as well, including a girl who I found out on my own that shes friends with my crush. Now I will say I have zero interest in her, and I had never followed her on insta, but since her insta was public for everyone to see and my crush‚Äôs insta is private, I would look at her friends story and see if my crush was hanging out with her or just to see her from someone elses story and what kind of person she is. Because that friend would post pics of her and my crush all the time. Idk if that makes sense but all im saying is that I was curious and wanted to investigate. After all I had a crush on her ten years ago so I wanted to know who she was.

So I messaged her and everything went super well. We had really good conversations and I could tell she was really interested in me. We would talk for hours and I really began to like her personality and we got to know each other. I had asked her if we could go for some coffee after speaking with each other for about two weeks and she agreed to it. So I had picked her up in the morning we had a good time at a restaurant. Later that night I asked if she was down to go to the ferris wheel in one city because she mentioned it. She agreed to go and we set the day three days from then. 

The next day. Now it gets bad. My friends and I went to the same restaurant the next day and I messaged her saying im back at the restaurant. She then said oh I found out that my friend ( the one who I had been looking at her stories) grandmas friend owns that restaurant. She had mentioned her friends name to me as if I knew her so I thought it to be weird. But I had said I dont think I know (her name) . She said yes you do! We went to elementary together. About 15 minutes later i saw her friend posted her story and I went and checked it. An hour later my crush sent me screenshots of me viewing her friends story saying ‚Äúthought you didn‚Äôt know her‚Äù now I dont know if that was lying or just a misunderstanding, but when I said I dont know her, i mean like, i dont talk to her, or know where she lives lol or anything about her other than the fact that she is friends with my crush and thats it. But she then said ‚Äú this early on and theres lies‚Äù, and that hurt a lot because now I broke trust. I asked if she can call me to talk about it and she called. At this point, i didnt know what to do. I wanted to clarify and fix it but I was so caught up in my emotions, that I ended up saying dumb things that probably didnt make sense. She told me in the call that she doesnt want to feel like she got to keep her head on a swivel, and I could really tell she lost trust in me. Then she said something that I could never forget. She told me in the call that she learned a lot about me just now. That really cut me. And im really sad to say, I probably sounded angry, and it felt like an argument :‚Äô(. Looking back I hate myself for how I acted and handled it, but thats what happened. She said at the end ‚Äúhow about no for the ferris wheel‚Äù which was what we planned three days later. We ended the call but five minutes later I called back apologizing. I didnt think I was sincere. But she said im going to take a step back. Later that evening I messaged her saying lets talk about it because I cant let this day go without making it up. And she said i think its best if we not because you were adamant about your stance and thats fine. She also said we dont have to come to an agreement. I responded by saying I have to get your trust back because you have a good reason say I lied. 

The day before the canceled plans for another date, I asked a friend who is much older than me, what to do to gain someones trust back. I ended up telling him everything and he said ‚Äúif she said she wants to take a step back, that means she isnt interested in you and she never was. He told me she probably had someone else and other bs that I started to believe because i trusted him. But the thing is , he doesnt know her, only I do. But I believed him. Another big mistake. After my conversation with my supposed friend, i called her to ask if we were cool. But again, my emotions and how I was feeling got to me, I couldnt think straight and I ended up just talking bs to her and probably not making sense to her. But I asked if we were cool and she said yes we are cool, and that she had already forgotten about what happened but i didnt think she did. So we ended the call and that was the last time I spoke to her. My supposed friend told me to unfollower her, deleted messages and everything. And to ignore her. What kind of toxic shady advice is that. But I believed in what he said and caved into my insecurities that maybe she did find someone else or she didnt actually like me. All I did was unfollow her. BAD IDEA OFC. A day later, she unfollows me. I was devastated by what ive done. Everything ive done, without even daring to not even in a million years would I ever want to, yet I involuntarily pushed her and scared her away by my actions. The very girl I want to be in a relationship with. My stupidity. I tried calling and of course, no answer, texted her, left on delivered. That was the end of it. I pretty much fxked it all up. Lost her trust, and showed her how much of a fool I am and I cant handle situations. But, although I dont want to make an excuse, in my defence, I was going through a lot at the time. My mom had some health problems and needed surgery, and my friend who passed away, his son who I was close with was in the hospital for cancer and passed away the week my crush and I had the situation happen. So I had a lot going on emotionally and I think that had something to do with how I handled it. But its been a month since we talked, and I want to find a way to get back to how it was. And for her to trust me again. If I could express how I feel and apologize sincerely and say sorry for how I treated her and how I made her feel. if only I can have the chance to, I would absolutely. I thought of a letter, but I need help. Any suggestions, thank you to all who read my long story haha. i needed to express it. But anyway thanks for the advice. :)",0,1733016154.0,relationship_advice,0,0.5,False

Later that night I asked if she was down to go to the ferris wheel in one city because she mentioned it. She agreed to go and we set the day three days from then. 

The next day. Now it gets bad. My friends and I went to the same restaurant the next day and I messaged her saying im back at the restaurant. She then said oh I found out that my friend ( the one who I had been looking at her stories) grandmas friend owns that restaurant. She had mentioned her friends name to me as if I knew her so I thought it to be weird. But I had said I dont think I know (her name) . She said yes you do! We went to elementary together. About 15 minutes later i saw her friend posted her story and I went and checked it. An hour later my crush sent me screenshots of me viewing her friends story saying ‚Äúthought you didn‚Äôt know her‚Äù now I dont know if that was lying or just a misunderstanding, but when I said I dont know her, i mean like, i dont talk to her, or know where she lives lol or anything about her other than the fact that she is friends with my crush and thats it. But she then said ‚Äú this early on and theres lies‚Äù, and that hurt a lot because now I broke trust. I asked if she can call me to talk about it and she called. At this point, i didnt know what to do. I wanted to clarify and fix it but I was so caught up in my emotions, that I ended up saying dumb things that probably didnt make sense. She told me in the call that she doesnt want to feel like she got to keep her head on a swivel, and I could really tell she lost trust in me. Then she said something that I could never forget. She told me in the call that she learned a lot about me just now. That really cut me. And im really sad to say, I probably sounded angry, and it felt like an argument :‚Äô(. Looking back I hate myself for how I acted and handled it, but thats what happened. She said at the end ‚Äúhow about no for the ferris wheel‚Äù which was what we planned three days later. We ended the call but five minutes later I called back apologizing. I didnt think I was sincere. But she said im going to take a step back. Later that evening I messaged her saying lets talk about it because I cant let this day go without making it up. And she said i think its best if we not because you were adamant about your stance and thats fine. She also said we dont have to come to an agreement. I responded by saying I have to get your trust back because you have a good reason say I lied. 

The day before the canceled plans for another date, I asked a friend who is much older than me, what to do to gain someones trust back. I ended up telling him everything and he said ‚Äúif she said she wants to take a step back, that means she isnt interested in you and she never was. He told me she probably had someone else and other bs that I started to believe because i trusted him. But the thing is , he doesnt know her, only I do. But I believed him. Another big mistake. After my conversation with my supposed friend, i called her to ask if we were cool. But again, my emotions and how I was feeling got to me, I couldnt think straight and I ended up just talking bs to her and probably not making sense to her. But I asked if we were cool and she said yes we are cool, and that she had already forgotten about what happened but i didnt think she did. So we ended the call and that was the last time I spoke to her. My supposed friend told me to unfollower her, deleted messages and everything. And to ignore her. What kind of toxic shady advice is that. But I believed in what he said and caved into my insecurities that maybe she did find someone else or she didnt actually like me. All I did was unfollow her. BAD IDEA OFC. A day later, she unfollows me. I was devastated by what ive done. Everything ive done, without even daring to not even in a million years would I ever want to, yet I involuntarily pushed her and scared her away by my actions. The very girl I want to be in a relationship with. My stupidity. I tried calling and of course, no answer, texted her, left on delivered. That was the end of it. I pretty much fxked it all up. Lost her trust, and showed her how much of a fool I am and I cant handle situations. But, although I dont want to make an excuse, in my defence, I was going through a lot at the time. My mom had some health problems and needed surgery, and my friend who passed away, his son who I was close with was in the hospital for cancer and passed away the week my crush and I had the situation happen. So I had a lot going on emotionally and I think that had something to do with how I handled it. But its been a month since we talked, and I want to find a way to get back to how it was. And for her to trust me again. If I could express how I feel and apologize sincerely and say sorry for how I treated her and how I made her feel. if only I can have the chance to, I would absolutely. I thought of a letter, but I need help. Any suggestions, thank you to all who read my long story haha. i needed to express it. But anyway thanks for the advice. :)",1,1733016099.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

After three weeks at sea, they arrive in Arcane after disembarking from the ship. Once in the city, Kronos tells Olaf to take Freddy and the banshee to the guard and lock them up. ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN LOCK ME UP?"" said Freddy. ""We're sorry, but it's for your good to keep you from trying to run away,"" said Shireen. Before he can try to run, Farooq knocks Freddy unconscious. Olaf tells Kronos that what he's doing isn't right. He shouldn't sacrifice one life to save his own. ""MY LIFE, I BEEN DOING THIS FOR ALL OF OUR LIVES FOR THE WORLD. WHAT'S ONE LIFE COMPARED TO THE WHOLE WORLD? ANSWER ME THAT,"" says Kronos. Olaf leads Farooq and Ham to the guard to lock up Freddy and the banshee Galadriel. Olaf decides to stay with the prisoners while Farooq and Ham catch up to Kronos and the rest of the group. Galadriel tries to talk to the wizard and convince him to let her go, but he won't hear of it. ""I don't know what will be done with you, Galadriel, but you are safer in that cell than you are on the streets with no money.

It's young Freddy; I weep, for his fate is worse than yours, and he will suffer greatly for the crime of being from a foreign land and not knowing our customs,"" said the wizard. Kronos goes to see a doctor he knows in the city. He asks the doctor to join him at the guard so he can examine someone for him. Kronos offers to pay the doctor his weight in gold if he does the job right. Back at the guard, Freddy wakes up as he comes to Olaf, who won't meet his eyes, and tells him to relax. ""RELAX, RELAX, YOU SON OF A BITCH. I TRIED TO HELP YOU, AND THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT ME?"" asked Freddy. ""I understand your anger, but you must understand Uncle Papi is a powerful wizard. The only way to defeat him is to summon our god, the one above all who can save us from the great evil Uncle Papi,"" said Olaf. Freddy asks why they call their god ze, and Olaf explains that their god is male and female. ""Ze made man in the morning to work hard and provide for his family, and ze made Female at night to stand guard over her children and make love to her husband ze was wise and knew where each of man and woman's strengths came from,"" he said. Freddy isn't surprised that men and women aren't equal. It seems some things never change. ""What does your god have to do with me? Do you think he sent me here?"" asked Freddy. Olaf shakes his head and tries to explain to Freddy what he did. ""You see, when you drank the water the snake offered you, you became the beacon to summon our god. The only way to summon our god is to slit your throat and spill all your blood onto the ground. Your blood will open a portal that our god will come through, and ze will save us from the wicked monster that has infested this land,"" said Olaf. Freddy can't believe he's about to be sacrificed to summon a god. He paces back and forth, crying with his head in his hands. Olaf gets closer to the bars of the cell to comfort Freddy.

Once he's close enough, Galadriel pulls him close and grabs his staff. She shoves the end of his staff into his stomach, and the wizard cries out for help as his blood pours from his stomach. Galadriel is about to bang the staff on the ground when Freddy also grabs it. He refuses to let it go, and as guards approach, the two of them bang the staff on the ground. Galadriel tells Freddy to hold on tight, and they disappear instantly. Opening his eyes, Freddy finds himself standing in the courtyard of a mountain fortress protected by skeleton guards. ""Do you like the place it's a rental?"" asked a man in a purple suit and stovepipe hat. The man with his thick Spanish accent questions what Galadriel and her friend are doing in his base. ""I want my power back. I need to become a banshee again. Please give me the power. It's all I've ever wanted!"" Yells Galadriel, tearing at her dress. Uncle Papi is unmoved by her tears. He makes it clear that he's a businessman. If she has nothing to trade him, he has nothing to give her in return. ""BUT THE STAFF, I HAVE THE STAFF,"" she says, showing him the magic staff in her hands. ""You have half a staff. It belongs to both of you, Galadriel. You and your friend used the staff, meaning its magic flows through both of you. Kill him and claim the power for yourself,"" said Uncle Papi. Before Galadriel can turn around and face him, Freddy bashes her in the head with a rock.

He then grabs the staff and points it at Uncle Papi. ""That won't do any good if you insist on leaving. I'd recommend tapping the staff and saying the magic word Acana,"" said Uncle Papi. ""Why would I do that?"" asked Freddy. ""Because you have made many enemies in this world, try to keep your head down and your hands clean in the next one, dear boy,"" he said, smiling at Freddy with his big white teeth. After saying the magic word, Freddy walks through a magic portal to another world. Landing in a mud puddle, Freddy looks around for the staff in its place. He finds a cane with a gold gem in its center. Stripping off his leather armor, Freddy looks for some clothes. He finds a farmhouse near where he landed in the mud. Knocking on the door, he finds a black family. They welcome him into their home and ask if white men take his clothes. ""No, I landed in mud and ruined my clothes. I need something to wear to find my way home. I'll be on my way if you'd kindly lend me something to wear.

Do you know where I might be able to catch the bus around here?"" asked Freddy. ""Tell you what, Mister, you stay the night with us, and I'll drive you into town in the morning. You can catch the bus from there. Do you have enough money for the bus, sir?"" asked the man of the house. ""I guess I could use $30 for the bus if you don't mind,"" said Freddy. ""Are you crazy? Where are you going to the moon or someplace like that? With $30, a colored man could live like a king and buy a dam car for that money,"" said the man of the house. Freddy is about to ask the man how he could ever buy a car with $30 when he notices the newspaper on the man's desk. He sees the year is 1929, and he is in Massachusetts. Freddy asks how far the closest town is and is told the closest town to his farm is Innsmouth. He can take the bus to Innsmouth tomorrow if he'd like.

Freddy asks the man why, if Innsmouth is so close to his farm, he can't just drive him to the town so he can find a room for the night. ""I don't drive to Innsmouth, mister. Most colored folk that steps into that town are never seen again, and I don‚Äôt plan to be one of them,"" said the man. With that, Freddy goes to sleep, and the next morning, he eats a plate of eggs with bacon and grits before getting into the farmer's truck. The man drives him to Thaos. The farmer drops Freddy off at the bus station with $2 in his pocket. After dropping Freddy off, the farmer rushes home before dark. Freddy walks over to the window at the bus station to buy a ticket to Innsmouth. The man behind the window gives Freddy a dirty look before taking his money. The bus to Innsmouth costs $1.25, leaving 75 cents for Freddy to buy himself a coffee.

The coffee only costs a penny, but the woman working in the diner won't serve a colored person, so Freddy is forced to wait for the bus without his cup of joe. The bus arrives an hour late, and the white customers can board first. after waiting another 20 minutes to board the bus, Freddy sits in the back of the bus and tries to get a little sleep; he's the only black person on the bus as it is the express bus to Innsmouth and as the Farmer already told him colored people don't go to Innsmouth. The bus arrives at Innsmouth in three hours. Freddy waits for the white patrons to disembark before he gets off the bus. The town itself is deserted. It's the middle of the day, and no one is on the streets. Freddy can't understand why this town is the last stop for a bus when it seems to be dead. Freddy hopes to take a ship from Innsmouth to New York to escape those pursuing him. Innsmouth is the closest port town in the area, and Freddy wants to leave as soon as possible. Walking to the docks, Freddy asks the ship‚Äôs captain if he'll take off soon. The Captain tells him to fuck off because he won't be going to sea with any Niggers on his ship. Freddy walks away from the man, fists clenched. After talking with six other captains, Freddy finds a room for the night. Expecting to be turned away by every hotel or boarding house in town, Freddy is surprised that the first hotel he tries to stay in accepts him and allows him to stay for just 25 cents a night. Freddy goes to his room and locks the door. Hanging up his suit, Freddy goes to sleep for the night. Back on the farm, the farmer, Willie Jones, and his wife, May Jones, are sitting down to dinner when they hear a knock on the door. Opening the door, Willie sees a smear of slime on the door. Willie calls out to whoever knocked on the door to step into the light as he looks around with his lantern.

Looking at a post on the edge of his farm, Willie sees what looks like a scarecrow. Grabbing his shotgun, Willie goes to the post office to see what's sitting there. Bashing the thing sitting up on his post, Willie sees it's his scarecrow. Mr. Murphy looks at the spot where Mr. Murphy is meant to be hanging, and Willie sees a scarecrow. Walking over to where his scarecrow is supposed to be hanging, he removes the long overcoat that he is wearing and sees something strange. As he raises his shotgun to fire at the thing on his post, Willie is attacked. The creature leaps down from the post onto Willie's chest. The last thing May hears is her husband screaming and a shotgun blast before she races out of the house to look for her husband. Finding nothing but green blood and his shotgun on the ground, May takes the truck and drives to her neighbor's house. In Innsmouth, Freddy tries to sleep when he hears someone standing outside his door talking to someone else. ""We don't have enough Niggers to take care of the eggs. We can take this one while he's sleeping, and once the squishers come back with a fresh crop, we'll have enough to care for the eggs until winter,"" said one of the voices. As someone tries to turn the knob to open the door to Freddy's room, he grabs his bow and gets ready to fire at whoever is trying to get into his room, but the knob doesn't turn as it's locked with his magic arrows Freddy doesn't have to worry about running out of arrows as they magically return to his quiver after they hit whatever he's aiming at. After a few minutes of trying to turn the knob and get into Freddy's room, whoever is on the other side of the door gives up and leaves. Freddy spends the rest of the night awake, unable to sleep because of the fear that whoever was out there might return. In the morning, he goes outside to find something to eat before trying the docks again.

Freddy isn't looking forward to talking to the sea captains as most of them are openly racist, and the rest are just condescending as they talk down to him because of the color of his skin. Freddy finds a diner attached to the hotel that serves breakfast for just a nickel. Freddy orders the house special inside the diner and is served fried fish with two eggs sunny side up and a biscuit with gravy. After eating, Freddy goes to the docks to talk with the captains. As he has no money, he can only offer the captains some free labor. As passing by one of the captains, he recognizes the captain's voice from last night. Freddy writes down the name of the man's ship and returns to his hotel.¬†¬†

¬†Freddy sits in his hotel room, waiting for the man he saw today to return to his room. Freddy holds the wizard's cane in one hand to use as a club; in his other hand, he holds an arrow ready to jab it in the eye of anyone who tries to get into his room. At about a little after midnight, Freddy hears a knock at the door, screaming, ‚Äúwho is it? At the person knocking, Freddy waits for an answer. ""It's May Jones, the woman whose farm you stayed at, mister,"" she says, waiting to be let in. Freddy unlocks the door and lets May into his room. He asks her what brings her to Innsmouth at this hour. ""Is your husband okay, Ms. Jones? Is something wrong?"" Freddy asks. May explains that her husband was taken last night by something strange. ""It's been happening all over Massachusetts. Whenever someone of color steps near the town of Innsmouth, they will disappear, no questions asked,"" says May. Freddy feels bad for May and decides to help her find her husband. Before they go, Freddy asks her if she's heard of something called a squisher. May has never heard of this thing and tells Freddy that it sounds like some fish. ""IS THAT WHAT THEY MAKE YOU EAT HERE IN INNSMOUTH?"" asked May. ""No, it's just something one of the men, I think, took Willie was talking about. I was just wondering if you'd heard about it before,"" said Freddy. Freddy tells May they will confront the man he thinks took Willie and find out where he's being held. Freddy gives May his bow and quiver, telling her not to shoot unless she has a clear shot. Freddy takes the cane with both hands and opens the door to his room. Walking downstairs, Freddy and May see the hotel manager reading a book.

He glances up at them before returning to his book. the man seems uninterested in whatever Freddy and May are doing as he spares them only a passing glance while the two leave the hotel armed with weapons and ill intent in their eyes. Freddy and May reach the boat that the man Freddy heard talking yesterday was on. They board the boat and begin looking around. The boat is a rather large fishing vessel with nets and lobster traps. Freddy walks around the nets, but May gets tangled up in them. Feeling a tug on the netting, May calls out to Freddy, who watches as the net is pulled into the water. Freddy jumps into the water, going after the net. May is holding her breath underwater while Freddy tries to remove the net from around her leg. Something grabs him from behind, swinging the cane at whoever is behind him. Freddy sees the golden gem glow, and the creature gets sucked into the gem-like water, getting sucked down the drain. Swallowing water mixed with monster blood, Freddy uses an arrow to cut May free of the net, and the two get out of the water. A light turns on in one of the windows and then another and another. Freddy and May run for their lives back to the hotel. Tonight is Freddy's last night in the hotel as he can't afford to stay there anymore. ""Why don't you stay with me on the farm until we find Willie? I'm sure he wouldn't want me on that farm alone,"" says May. Freddy agrees to come to the farm with her, and after packing his bags, the two of them leave for the farm. They take Willie's truck, and they head back to the farm. The hotel manager waves goodbye to Freddy as he drives out of town, blinking with two sets of eyelids.

The man smiles and says, ""Y'all come back now, ya hear."" Freddy and May are soaked to the bone. Freddy taps the gem on the wizard's cane and dries him and May until they are dry and clean. The cane seems to be able to do anything its user wants. All Freddy has to do is think about what he wants, and the cane will do it. May stops the truck in the middle of the road and demands to know how Freddy dried them with his cane and how he killed whatever was after them. ""This cane is magic. It can do anything, and those arrows I gave you are magic. also, you wanna see?"" asked Freddy. Getting out of the car, Freddy tells May to aim for a fence post on the side of the road. Having never used a bow before, May tries to figure out how to aim with the bow and arrow. Aiming at the post, May fires her arrow. She hits the post, then the arrow disappears and reappears in its quiver. May is amazed that the arrow has such magic in it. She practices with the bow for almost an hour until Freddy gets bored and asks if they can go home. May puts the bow and quiver in the back of the truck and drives back to the farm. Freddy and May spend the night talking about what happened to him. He explains cell phones and Racial equality to her; she can't believe it. ""SO, YOU ARE TELLING ME THAT ONE DAY COLORED FOLKS ARE GONNA BE TREATED LIKE WHITE FOLKS?"" asked May. Freddy doesn‚Äôt want to ruin her night by telling her about the police or what a Karen is, so he smiles and tells her everyone is treated equally.

The next morning, May wakes Freddy up early so he can do some chores around the farm. She points him to a chicken coop and tells him to collect the eggs so they can sell them in the city. After that, Freddy has to milk the cows, water the corn, and feed the dogs and the cat. After a long day of working on the farm, Freddy rests while May works on dinner. She cooks a stew made of rabbit and deer with fresh rolls and some grilled corn.

Once the sun goes down, Freddy lies in his bed trying to find sleep, but it does not come easily. May is sleeping in her bedroom with the door locked, and the bow and quiver clutched in her arms. Freddy tries for an hour to sleep, but after that, he gives up and sits in bed. He wonders how anyone, let alone an entire group, could take being treated like trash for so long without snapping. But then Freddy thinks back to his childhood and how his mother always told him to stay away from the police and not to talk back to them no matter what they said. Freddy remembers this and thinks about how far we've come and how much farther we've yet to come. As he is deep in thought, Freddy hears something outside, a splattering sound like something wet hitting the ground. Grabbing his cane, Freddy goes to check what that sound is. Walking outside, he sees a green-skinned creature that looks somewhat like a man with giant bulbous bulging eyes. Its sharp teeth and wicked-looking nails look like something out of Freddy's worst nightmares.

Lifting his cane to use it as a weapon, Freddy smacks the creature across the face gem, first taking a chunk of the monster's skin off as he strikes it. The creature howls out in pain and turns to run. The monster's skin is wetter than normal skin; it feels like a scaly sponge. Freddy peels the skin off his cane and is about to return to the house when he hears a siren coming from behind him. Freddy hears a voice call out, telling him to walk slowly toward the street. As he walks past the truck, Freddy pretends to fall to the ground and hides the cane under the truck. ""GET OFF THE GROUND NIGGER AND WALK TO ME NOW,"" said the police officer. Freddy gets up and walks over to the officer. He tries to explain that he fell, but the policeman doesn't care. He beats Freddy bloody for wasting his time with his nonsense. He then cuffs Freddy and tosses him into the back seat of his car.¬† Opening the door to his police car, the officer waits for someone or something to get into his car. Freddy sees the creature with its face chunk missing coming towards the car. Freddy yells for the officer to shut the door to the car and not let that thing touch him. ""QUITE NIGGER, AND YOU HURRY UP. WE NEED TO GET GOING BEFORE THE SUN COMES UP,"" says the officer. As the creature walks towards the car, its jaw clicking and snapping, an arrow comes sailing through the sky into the creature's shoulder. The arrow strikes the creature from behind and disappears. Freddy smiles, knowing that May is awake and she's trying to help him.

The police officer jumps in the car, calling out to the monster on the road to run. The officer takes off, driving down the road towards Innsmouth. Freddy screams and kicks the back of the officer's seat before the cop finally pulls over on the side of the road and bashes him in the head with his nightstick. The next thing Freddy knows, he's waking up in a room with six other black men chained to the room's walls. Looking around the stone walls of the cramped basement room, Freddy tries to pull himself free of his restraints. Someone comes downstairs, and Freddy looks up to see the police officer who arrested him and the boat captain whose voice he recognized walking towards him. The two men unchain him and three others and lead them upstairs. ""WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO US YOU RACIST FUCKS,"" said Freddy, demanding to know what's going on. ""Just keep walking; you'll see what's going on once you get upstairs,"" said the officer. Freddy walks up the stairs, and a bright light shines on his face from overhead. Walking into the room, Freddy sees eggs on the warehouse floor. The eggs themselves are giant with green spots. They are twice the size of an ostrich egg and very heavy. Freddy is forced to stand in line with other black men, tending to the eggs by pouring water on them and covering them in sticky slime. One of his fellow prisoners is tasked with teaching Freddy and the other three men what to do with the eggs. The man's name is Otis Clemens. Otis is an older man. It appears he's been missing for more than 20 years. He explains to the boys how to care for the eggs and tells them to be careful with the slime as it retains water and has been known to dry out workers' hands.

""WORKERS, YOU MEAN SLAVES, DON'T YOU? WE AIN'T GETTING PAID TO TAKE CARE OF THESE MONSTER BABIES, NOW ARE WE!"" Yelled one of the men behind Freddy. Otis tries to calm the man down before the overseers get involved, but it's too late. One of the overseers, a big white man with gills and webbed fingers, grabs the slave and slams him hard on the warehouse floor. After two weeks of forced labor, Freddy gives up hope of anyone coming to help him. The days start to blend as boats come in, bring new eggs to the warehouse, and leave with the old eggs that have been watered and slimed. This goes on for weeks until Freddy hears a commotion from outside. The overseers get their guns and prepare for a fight.

""THERE'S AN ARMY HEADED THIS WAY WE HAVE TO RUN,"" says one of the overseers, entering the building from outside. Freddy, the overseer with the gills and webbed fingers, he calls Fish face and tells the rest of the men in the room that they aren't going anywhere. He explains that they can't leave the eggs unprotected, and whoever is coming for them won't have the advantage once the sun goes down and the squishers come out to play. As the door to the warehouse swings open, a mob of black women and teenagers welding guns begins firing at the overseers. Fish face flees the fighting, leaving the eggs unprotected. Freddy picks up one of the eggs and smashes it over the head of an overseer who has his back turned to him. Following his lead, the rest of the slaves begin destroying eggs as the women and children who came to rescue the men enter the warehouse led by May, who fires an arrow at one of the eggs, smashing it and sending purple yokes everywhere into the mouths of a few of the men standing by the egg. May and the rest of the women unchain Freddy and the men. Freddy leads her to the basement, where they keep a few other men. After freeing everyone from the warehouse, May and her group drive away from Innsmouth back to the farm. Once back on the farm, May learns that Willie was killed during his first week at the warehouse.¬†¬†

It's all coming together now.

A week after the rescue, Freddy, May, and all the men, women, and children they saved from Innsmouth have come to stay on the farm with them. May want to return to Innsmouth for Willie's body, but Otis and another man named Curtis Redfield tell May that her husband was fed to the squishers just like all the dead and dying slaves. ""I'm sorry for your loss, Ms. Jones, but you can't return for his body. There's nothing left, not even bones,"" said Otis. May cries as word of her husband's fate reaches her ears. Freddy walks up to May and Otis and asks what's going on. Otis explains that he told May why she can't return to Innsmouth for her husband's remains. Freddy gets down on one knee and holds May in his arms. He asks Otis to operate the grill for a while so he can take May into the house to sleep. Freddy lays May down in her bed and kisses her forehead before shutting the door to her room and returning downstairs. Freddy remembers his cane and looks under the truck. He finds the cane wedged inside the wheelbase and pulls it free. Freddy is starting to get used to using the cane for magical purposes. He even starts writing his own spell book; each spell is written in a Viking runic language Freddy studied in school. Freddy doesn‚Äôt know as many spells as the wizard Olaf, but he does have a few good ones. Freddy is particularly proud of his levitation spell, which he's mostly used for getting things off the roof. As night falls, Freddy and the rest of his people enjoy some nice barbeque ribs with grilled corn and lemonade. A few women begin singing a song they heard on the radio while their husbands are away, and Otis complains that music today sounds like noise.

""What happened to the good old days when you could listen to something classy like opera? This jazz is driving me crazy,"" said Otis. Freddy pours Otis another cup of lemonade and tells him that if he hates music now, he'll hate the kind of music that he listens to in his world. A roar fills the air as men and women dance and sing along to the music. Most men are still weak from their enslavement in the warehouse, but Freddy and a few others are strong enough to fight. Freddy casts a shield spell around the farm. A golden glow shoots out of his cane into the sky, creating a dome covering the farm. Freddy drives the cane into the ground, strengthening the shield spell as a group of squishers runs headfirst into the dome, colliding with the dome. The green-skinned creatures explode in contact with the dome. Behind the monsters comes Fish face and his men. They fire their guns at the house, hitting a few people on the porch. As the bullets shatter men and women's skulls as they pass through the shield, Freddy needs to do something so that the rest of his people can get to their guns. The few men and women with guns only have small caliber handguns as they sit ducked down behind a fallen tree. Freddy heads to the shed, where they keep the rifles and shotguns. The squishers try to get around the dome by climbing trees close to the property and knocking them down on the top, hoping to take down the shield. While bullets can get through the dome, trees, and other living things cannot get through the dome. The squishers hope to overwhelm the shield and bring it down, but the cane is too powerful. Freddy reaches the shed and grabs two handfuls of rifles and shotguns. He then begins tossing them to people around him until the shed is empty. Once everyone has a weapon, Freddy goes upstairs to check on May. He finds her in the window with her bow, firing arrows at squishers hiding in trees. Since they've been there, her aim has improved, and she gets a kill shot for one out of every three shots she takes. May sees Fish face standing behind a police car, and she aims at his head. As she lets her arrow fly, the back of Fish face‚Äôs head is caved in by a blow from a Warhammer. May looks at the man who killed Fish face and sees a large black man in strange elven-like clothing.

The big man picks another man up with his Warhammer and brings him down to the ground with a blow to the stomach, leaving a hole in his stomach and blood on the man's face. Freddy recognizes the big man, unsure how Kronos got to this world. Freddy knows he must escape before the violent and unstable man kills him. Freddy grabs the cane off the ground and heads into the woods with May. He tells everyone else to run into the house or find shelter elsewhere. Running through the woods, Freddy and May run headfirst into Elvira, who tells them not to move. ""Come along quietly, and no one will get hurt,"" says Elvira. ""Please, you have to let us go. Those white men want to enslave us, and if you don't let us go, Kronos will kill me,"" said Freddy. Elvira leans in close to Freddy. She kisses him on the mouth, shocking May, who has never seen such a thing before. Elvira grabs Freddy's cock as she's kissing him, and once she lets go, she tells him to head to the highway because they have people guarding the woods. Kronos and his sister take control of the situation, killing the squishers and their allies. The men and women still alive on the property can either join Kronos in his hunt for Freddy or die. Farooq and Ham stand with their leader, telling the people that if they fight for them, they'll be rewarded with gold and silver.

Over the next three weeks, Kronos and his army are searching for Freddy and May non-stop. Shireen tries to convince her brother to give his men a break, but Kronos tells his sister that until they have captured Freddy, no one is getting a break. Arriving with his cutthroats is Hue Hardluck. The man and his free company enjoy seeing cars and lamp posts. Hue is impressed by this technology and wonders if he can bring some of these things home. ""I can make enough gold for myself and every man in my company to die rich,"" says Hue. Kronos tells him he can take whatever he wants if he finds Freddy and brings him back alive. ""DON'T WORRY YOU'LL GET YOUR PRAY AS LONG AS I CAN HAVE A LITTLE FUN AS WELL,"" said Hue. Kronos sets up camp in May's house. He sends Hue and 30 of his men, Otis and Curtis, into the city to track down Freddy and May. Otis leads Hue and 15 of his men to the bus station, where they begin to question all the drivers and employees at the bus station.

Everyone laughs at Hue and his men's outfits. They look like a medieval role-playing group with their axes and their tights. Hue doesn‚Äôt pay any attention to the people around him until a big man with short, cropped hair and a black and white striped shirt walks up to Hue and pulls off his codpiece, throwing it into the street. The man and his friends begin to laugh, and Hue pulls out his sword and cuts the big man across the face. With that, it's Hue's turn to laugh with his friends. The big man looks down at the ground, blood dripping from his face. The man is in shock, but not wanting to lose face in front of his friends, he grabs Hue and lifts him off the ground. Pulling out a dagger, Hue cuts off two of the man's fingers, loosening the man's grip on him. The man turns his back to Hue, showing all his friends his injured fingers. The big man screams as he and his friends race away from Hue and his men. Hue licks the blood off his dagger and then goes to a bar to grab something to drink. Walking into the bar with blood all over him, Hue is a sight to behold. He drops a purse of gold on the bar and Yells. ""DRINKS ON ME."" The bartender grabs the purse of gold and dumps the coins onto the bar. He can't believe his eyes are gold right before him. The man puts the coins away and starts pouring drink after drink for his customers. ""Everybody gathering around this fruit is paying for the drinks tonight,"" says the bartender, pouring himself a shot of whiskey. Hue orders the strongest Ale the bartender has, and the man gives him some Gin. Once everyone is good and drunk, Hue questions them about Freddy and May. No one in the bar has heard of either of them, so Hue tells the bartender to give him a few bottles of gin and scotch for the road. Curtis takes the 15 other men, led by a man called the Grunt, who is a half-goblin and wears a spiked helmet and a pair of goggles with tinted lenses. Grunt stands almost 7 feet tall, as his father was a giant.

The goblin man wears leather armor and carries twin blades, each with goblin writing on the side. Grunt carries a buckler on his back. The small shield has a spike in the center and is kept in place by a strap around his shoulder. Men and women part ways as the huge goblin passes by them. Curtis takes the men to the police station so they can file a missing person's report. Curtis walks into the police station and asks to speak to someone in charge. ""You see, sir, my friend Freddy and his wife May. They've gone missing. They live at the Thibodeaux farm near Innsmouth, sir, and I haven't seen them in ages,"" said Curtis. The police officer at the front desk listens to Curtis and takes his statement, but something in the officer's eye tells him that the officer isn't taking his complaint seriously. Curtis goes outside and tells the Grunt about what happened with the police officer. The big goblin grabs a large shack and walks into the police station. ""EVERYONE GATHER AROUND I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU,"" he says, lifting the shack and dumping the massive amount of gold onto the floor.

The officers, all of whom had their guns out, put them away. When they see the gold, they grab handfuls of it and shove it into their pockets. Once the officers gather all the gold, they follow Grunt into the street. They jump into their cars and blare their sirens as they search for Freddy from house to house. men on foot stop random black men and compare them to the description Curtis gave them of Freddy. The officers head to Copper Town, the only city where a black man wouldn't stand out. The officers beat men bloody, demanding to know if they've seen Freddy or May. Hue catches up with Grunt, asking him why the police are working for him. Grunt explains that he bribed them with the spare gold they got for the necromancer's gem. ""YOU DID WHAT WITH MY GOLD?"" asked Hue Hard luck. Grunt smiles and shows Hue the guns and ammo he could buy with their gold. ""These will fetch my fat wife's weight in gold. The woman is half troll and eats like a whale,"" said Grunt. Hue smiles and looks at the guns. He is pleased with their purchase and tells the goblin man to keep up the good work.

Freddy and May are hiding in Copper Town. As he looks out the window, Freddy sees hundreds of police officers on the streets searching for someone. As they get closer and closer to his building, Freddy starts to worry, and then his worry turns to fear when he sees Hue Hardluck and a half-goblin walking around the streets, comparing every man they see to a picture they're holding. Freddy tells May to get dressed because they need to leave ASAP. As two police officers kick in the front door to their hotel, Freddy and May run out through the fire escape. ""HEY FREEZE YOU TWO IT'S THE POLICE,"" says one of the officers that kicked in their door. As they climb down the fire escape, Freddy uses his cane to cast a spell that makes him and May invisible. The two of them climb down the ladder and head to the truck. Freddy and May bought their new truck with May's money from selling her farm. Because she's a woman of color, May couldn't get the farm's actual worth, but she did get enough from the back to buy a new truck and a small house in the city she wanted to. Their new truck is blue with a white stripe, and as they drive past men and women being harassed by the police as Hue Hardluck and his men look on, Freddy starts to wonder if there is anywhere, they can run to where they will be safe. Kronos is sleeping in May's bed when they arrive, and men from the bank come to tell him that he is trespassing. The men all wear fine suits, and one wears a monocle, and he walks up to Kronos and tells him. ""Excuse me, boy, but you and your cohorts are trespassing on private property. If you don't vacate the premises within the next two days, we will be forced to have you removed by the police,"" said the banker. Kronos picks the banker up with one hand and cuts him in half with his Ax. As his bottom half falls to the ground, his guts and intestines fall out of his body onto the ground.

The banker also twitches until Kronos drops his top half to the ground. The rest of the bankers flee in terror. Kronos looks at his sister and tells her. ""They'll be back. We'd better get ready for them."" Shireen is having second thoughts about what they're doing and whether it is right to be hunting this man from world to world. Farooq and Ham have been eating May's chickens since they arrived on the farm. Chips stays close to his brother and serves as the group's cook. One of the women living in the house with them teaches Chips how to make fried chicken and grilled corn. The little elf boy goes crazy for fried chicken, crispy skin, and juicy meat. Chips can't get enough of the stuff. Farooq wants nothing more than to get drunk, but he has no beer or ale until he sees a group of men gathering corn to make something they call moonshine. Farooq follows the men and finds them bottling a white liquid. It doesn't take him long to figure out that what's in the bottles is some alcohol. Farooq grabs two bottles, one for him and the other for Ham. He takes the two bottles to a fire pit where Ham and his brother are sitting, and he hands his friend a bottle of moonshine, and the two start drinking together. After finishing their bottles of moonshine, Farooq and Ham start having trouble seeing the two men stand up with cloudy white eyes as they try to make it into the house. Ham calls his brother Chips to help him inside. Farooq calls out for help, and Elvira comes to his aid. She helps him into the house and places a damp rag on his forehead. Kronos orders his men to burn the moonshine still, and he hangs the four men who built it. Kronos tells the formerly enslaved people that if they want to be paid, they'll do their job and find Freddy; anything else they do will result in punishment.

¬†

Alberto opens his eyes underwater and is surrounded by sharks. The giant ten-foot creatures with double fins and razor-sharp teeth circle him. Having lost his sword and the others in his group, Alberto is forced to think fast and removed his boot, shoving it in the mouth of the closest shark and grabbing onto its fin. As the shark rushes to the surface, Alberto can breathe again. Once he can breathe, Al wishes for a boat and some oars to row away from the sharks. Hearing a yell in the distance, Alberto rows over and finds a man named Mark from the group almost drowning. Alberto saves him, and the two-row one with a vast ocean before them and no land in sight. The two are forced to keep rowing for what seems like hours. They can find ten more people. However, his main friends are still lost at sea. Wishing for a sailboat to give his crew a bit more legroom, Al becomes a captain overnight. Wishing that he and his group knew how to sail, they spent the next three weeks looking for more of their group members, mainly finding the bodies of the dead.

Occasionally, they would find someone clinging to a rock somewhere, drinking seawater, and eating raw fish. After each rescue, Alberto wishes for a bigger boat with more rooms. Many later rescues are sick and bedridden by their time at sea, and a few are ever driven mad. After a month of searching for survivors, the group gives up. The crew sails the endless ocean for what seems like forever. The crew comes across a message in a bottle. The message reads. ""Welcome to the Vacancy cruise ship getaway. We'll see you on the main island and thank you for choosing Vacancy Cruises."" After reading the note, Alberto crushes it with one hand and steers the ship west in the direction from which the note came.

Heading west makes it clear that the crew is done searching for survivors, and whoever is left alive is alone. Alberto must think of what is best for the crew. Overhead, a large white cloud seems to be following the ship. ""Hey, captain, that cloud seems to be following us, sir,"" said a crew member named Eric. ""You think a cloud is following us?"" asked Alberto. After giving the young man, the rest of the day off, Al tells the crew to keep their eyes on the horizon and keep an eye open for any land they see. Out of nowhere, storm clouds begin to fill the sky as lightning strikes near the ship, and hard rain falls on their heads. The crew takes action to defend the ship. Steering the ship straight into the eye of the storm, Alberto finds his ship getting knocked around by the storm. Looking up at the sky, Al sees the white cloud and sails for it.

""We have to make it to that cloud. It‚Äôs the only way we'll survive this storm,"" said Alberto as the ship rocked back and forth. The wood under their feet begins to splinter. Pulling hard to the left, Alberto and his crew make it to the white cloud just as the ship is about to be torn apart. Reaching the white cloud feels wonderful. The fresh air and clear sky overhead leave the crew with time to repair the ship. After a few days spent making repairs, Alberto hears a voice calling to him from the cloud. ""Hey, Al, look up, it's me. Look up,"" said a voice from the cloud. The half-asleep Alberto looks up and sees the masked man shutting his eyes. Al opens them wide and sees his friends dropping from the sky. The ship wakes quickly once people start falling from the sky and looking around. Many are happy to see their family members return to them. Many on the ship are concerned with how their loved ones wound up on a cloud in the first place. After a while, everyone calms down, and the crew spends the rest of the night talking with their families. The crew catches some fish for dinner, and Alberto catches up with Vie, Edger, and the masked man. ""So, Edger made a huge cloud and started rounding people up. That the whole story?"" asked Alberto.

This gives Al a plan, and he and Edger talk alone for a while. After a long talk, the ship rises from the sea and lands on the white cloud. Sailing on the cloud makes it easier to spot any islands. After a week of sailing the clouds, the S.S. Icy/Hot crew spots something strange about another ship in the clouds. The large ship is surrounded by smaller ships that fire harpoons at the bigger ship, trying to stop its movement. Once the larger ship is incapacitated, a group of men fly over to the larger ship on gliders and begin loading its goods onto their smaller ships. Wishing the ship invisible, Alberto waits until the pirates have gone, and then he sails to the larger ship. Boarding the large ship, Alberto, the masked man, Vie, and a few others look for the ship's crew. Seeing a few dead crewmen and a bunch of scattered supplies, Alberto and his crew search the captain's Quarters. Inside the captain's Quarters, they find what's left of the crew. The Captain and his First Mate are all left, so Al takes the two men to the ship's main deck. Seeing the bloody scene leaves the two men sick as they throw up over the ship's side. The two men explain that they were carrying cargo for the king of Sky City, but somehow, the pirates found out about their plans and attacked them on the route. After taking the crew of the large ship onto the Icy/Hot, Alberto and his crew welcome the recruits onto their ship.

Vie and Edger show the two men named Earl and Smokey around the ship and show them to their rooms. The next morning, Alberto and the masked man question Captain Earl about any islands he might know about. ""An island, of course, not after the ice caps melted. The world was covered with water, so most people took to the sky with flying ships or manufactured flying castles, but that‚Äôs all I know,"" looking down at his shoes, Alberto asks. ""So, you've never seen a single island or any people on the ground?"" Captain Earl thinks long and hard about his answer and speaks. ""No, not once since I've been sailing have, I seen anything on the ground."" With that, Alberto lets the Captain rest. He then returns to the helm of the ship and keeps on sailing. As storm clouds begin to fill the air, laughter fills the air.

The lightning cracks as the sky fills with small ships full of pirates. The pirates hold harpoons and grappling hooks as they get alongside the ship. The pirates board the ship, and Alberto and his crew fight them off. Wishing his crew swords and a few guns, the crew battles the pirates. Alberto lines up his gunners and tells Vie to lead them. With the gunners in place, Al keeps fighting the pirates. Alberto tells Vie to aim for the balloons holding up the pirate ships, and the gunners aim for hitting the target and sending the pirate ship falling to the earth. The pirate crew, seeing this, race back to their ships. After the pirates flee the battle, Alberto orders his crew to look for injured people. They find most of the injured are pirates and tend to their wounds before locking them up. With the pirates dealt with, Al and his crew decide to drop Captain Earl and First Mate Smokey at the sky city of Cloud Burst.

It takes three weeks of sailing to reach Cloud Burst, but once they arrive, the ship is welcomed for saving the crew of the air lifter. The sky city is a white city made of marble and glass held by huge balloons. With giant thrusters holding up the city as well, the citizens of the sky city feel safe and at home on the vast platform city. Meeting with the mayor of Cloud Burst, Alberto and the masked man spend a few hours talking with the mayor, and then they resupply the ship before heading to a bar for some drinks. Captain Earl and Smokey toast the crew of the Icy/Hot, all but Vie and Edger, who plan a hot date for themselves. Vie and Edger sit at a fancy table at the most exclusive restaurant in a cloud burst. ""I can't believe we got this table last minute,"" said Vie, holding Edger's hand. Back at the bar, Alberto and Sara get closer as the masked man dances with a waitress. At night, everyone returns to the hotel the mayor provided for them. Vie and Edger take a midnight stroll after dinner. While walking along the city's edge, they see a pirate ship hidden behind a cloud. As they turn to run, Vie sees the mayor standing alongside the pirate Captain. ""Hello, you two out kinds of late, wouldn't you say,"" said the mayor, grabbing onto Vie's arm. In the morning, Alberto and the masked man make the crew some coffee. After drinking their coffee, Alberto and the masked man look for Vie and Edger. After walking around the city for a few hours, Al finds no trace of Vie and Edger. Not wanting to leave the city without Vie and Edger, Alberto sees the mayor. ""So, your friends have gone missing? ‚ÄúWell, that is very concerning,"" said the mayor. ""I think I know where your friends might be hiding if you will follow me,"" he says. The mayor leads Alberto and the masked man to the docks.

Waiting, a large group of pirates is holding Vie and Edger hostage. The mayor shuts the door behind him as he enters the boathouse where Vie and Edger are held. ""You see, gentlemen, the pirates can attack our supply ships because they work for me,"" said the mayor. Pulling out his sword, Alberto takes the mayor hostage, ""if you don't let them go, I'll open his throat,"" said Alberto, holding his sword up to the mayor's neck. As the pirate‚Äôs release Vie and Edger, all four of them, plus the mayor, run out of the boathouse. The mayor struggles to escape Alberto's grasp; as townspeople see this, they rush to help the mayor. As the townspeople pull Alberto off the mayor and take away his sword, the mayor yells for the police to take Alberto and his friends away. It's Vie who convinces the group to check the boathouse before taking them to jail, ""if I'm wrong, you can still arrest us later,"" the mob of townspeople agrees to check the boathouse as the mayor sweats. Inside the boathouse, the townspeople find a large group of pirates. The mayor jumps onto one of the pirate ships, and the pirates take off. A large group of local sailors pursues the pirates.

As ships sail out of the city of Cloud Burst in pursuit of the pirates, a more considerable discussion must be had on who will be the new mayor. While most call for a vote, no one seems to know who they're voting for, as no one wants the mayor's job. Alberto wants to get his crew out of the city, but Captain Earl and Smokey think one should run for mayor and want Alberto to help them pick which one should be mayor. ""Well, which one of you wants this job?"" Alberto asks. ""My family has been a part of this city's government since the beginning of Cloud Burst,"" said Smokey, standing straight with one arm across his chest. Once it's his turn, Captain Earl stands up straighter and speaks clearly, ""I have been this boy's Captain for many years and simply can't let him become my boss. I'll miss sailing the sky, but I must be in command."" After hearing their reasons for wanting the job, Al gives them his opinion. ""Captain, you shouldn't give up the job you love just because you want to be in charge, and Smokey, if this is your dream, go for it, but only if you want this!"" After that, Captain Earl steps down, and Smokey is elected mayor in a landslide. Once the election is over, Alberto loads up his ship with supplies. A few of Al's crew members stay in Cloud Burst, and he and the rest take off. After a few days of smooth sailing, the crew becomes restless, taking the ship to the ground. Alberto encourages the crew to do a little fishing.

As the group is fishing, a large whirlpool is next to the ship, sucking it into itself. With the ship being pulled into the whirlpool, Alberto takes command of the ship and heads back into the sky. As Edger casts a flight spell, the whirlpool sucks them in faster. Seeing that this whirlpool will swallow the ship, Edger casts an air bubble spell on the ship. As the ship goes under the water, Al and his crew see the cause of the whirlpool: a huge crocodile swallows the ship whole. Inside the huge croc's belly, the crew sees an almost endless swamp filled with wildlife and smaller fish. The soaking-wet mouth of the crocodile smells awful and is dark. As the group stumbles around in the darkness, a voice calls out. ""Hello and welcome to the meat grinder,"" said the voice. Looking around, Alberto hears the voice coming from every direction, that is, until someone lights a torch. Seeing a row of ships, all with men holding torches, and standing before him is the mayor laughing and having a knife. ""Welcome to the pirate's hideaway,"" said the mayor, throwing his knife at Alberto and hitting him in the neck.

As Al falls backward, Vie fires an arrow at the mayor. After Alberto is hit, the fight begins with pirates jumping from their ships to attack Al's crew. His crew, angry at the loss of their Captain, fight with vigor and push the pirates back. Vie kills ten pirates with her bow and arrow, and Edger freezes the ground under the pirate's feet, forcing them to slip and slide on the crocodile's stomach. As Sara tends to Alberto's wound, the masked man cuts down pirate after pirate. The mayor orders the pirates to retreat farther into the crocodile's stomach. Fleeing their ships, the pirates run deeper into the croc's stomach as Alberto's crew stays behind to tend to him and their ship. The battle seems to have done some damage to the crocodile, as well as the beast howls above the surface. The crew turns the ship around and sails for the exit. All alongside them, the pirate ships begin to fall into formation, getting ready to attack the crew of the Icy/Hot. With one ship on either side of the Icy/Hot and one behind them, the crew is forced to fight on three fronts.

As the four ships exit the crocodile's mouth, the pirates throw burning bottles to try and burn down the ship, picking up some guns. Vie leads the gunners in a counterattack. Aiming for the balloons that hold up the pirate ships, Vie takes down one of the ships. The other two ships try moving away from the Icy/Hot, but Vie, unlike her gunners, doesn't need a minute to reload her bow. With her last two arrows, Vie takes down another pirate ship. The last pirate ship breaks away from the Icy/Hot. With the last ship getting away, the crew must devise a plan. The Icy/Hot can catch up with the last pirate ship by cutting through the clouds. Once both ships face each other, the gunner‚Äôs line up to fire, and on the pirate‚Äôs, sidemen are holding fire bottles and swords. Holding out their swords for battle, Alberto's crew fire their guns at the pirates, who fling their fire bottles back at the crew. After what feels like forever reloading their guns and putting out fires, the crew of the Icy/Hot boards the pirate ship and cuts the pirates to bits, leaving only the mayor, whom they jail and take back to Cloud Burst.

After handing over the mayor, the group stays in Cloud Burst for six more days, and then the crew of the Icy/Hot sets sail. Still looking for the mysterious island, Alberto's crew continues the long search on the ocean instead of the clouds. While in his office, Alberto hears a knock on the door, ""come in,"" he says. With that, Hector Gomez enters the room and takes a seat. ""Hello, Captain. In college, I took a few classes in climate change, and if this planet suffered a massive event like the polar ice caps melting, then all the land would still be here. It would just be‚Ä¶underwater,"" said Hector. Standing up to hug him, Alberto runs to find Edger, and the two devise a plan.

Alberto wishes for a massive air bubble to surround the boat, and Edger uses his magic to make the ship invisible. With the ship now protected from everything under the sea, the crew gets ready to dive, lowering the ship's dive until it is fully submerged. The water is dark under the surface, making it hard to see where the ship is headed. Al wishes for the boat to be a bioluminescent fish so that the sea comes alive with color as one fish seems to set off the next. The colors are light blues, deep purples, and bright pink. The sight is more than Alberto can take. It isn't just the fish that glows. A large shark glows bright green as it travels to the Icy/Hot. Alberto can still steer the ship, with the ship only looking like a fish on the outside. With a shark on their trail, the crew of the Icy/hot must quickly evade the beast before it makes a meal of them. Cutting through a patch of seaweed that glows bright green, the ship watches as the shark stops its pursuit. The crew takes a minute to celebrate before a huge piece of seaweed wraps around the ship and drags it into the darkness. The crew thinks quickly, and before the seaweed can burst the air bubble that keeps them safe, Edger uses his powers to freeze the bubble, slips through the seaweed's grasp, and floats to the surface. Unfreezing the ship before it reaches the surface, Edger casts a slippery when wet spell so nothing can grab hold of the ship. With that, their trip under the sea begins again, and the crew is forced to go one thousand leagues under the sea before they spot any land. The cities were the same as they were above ground, just underwater. This was a small town with a water tower and soda shop on the main street. Even now, it was a ghost town like all the others. The search for a lone island underwater will be hard enough, but to do so in the middle of what looks like a small town will be impossible. Just as the crew is giving up hope, a message in a bottle appears. Inside the bottle is a map with directions to the island. With the map in hand, the crew makes a beeline for the X on the map. Arriving halfway to the X, one of the crewmen spots something strange, ""Captain, something strange off the portside, sir!!!"" Looking over the port side of the ship, Alberto sees a bright, shining scale, hundreds of them shining in the darkness.

Shooting up past the ship are hundreds of mermaids and mermen, all with glowing tails and purple skin. They circle the ship a dozen times, getting closer to the ship each time they dance around it. Everyone gathers on the ship's deck to see the mermaids dancing around the ship. Out of nowhere, one of the mermen throws a bone spear at the ship, and everyone moves out of the way before Alberto realizes. ""They think we're a giant fish,"" he said before ordering the ship to take evasive maneuvers. The friendly mermaids pursue the ship, not wanting to let their dinner escape. The ship heads back into the seaweed, this time knowing that the weeds can't reach them. As the ship sails through the seaweed, the mermaids and mermen follow, and the seaweed takes many. The merfolk won't give up the hunt. Many begin hacking at the seaweed, and others cut holes in the seaweed.

The ship continues racing through the seaweed in hopes of losing the merfolk. Alberto thinks quickly and orders the ship to shoot straight up out of the water, knowing the merfolk won't follow them. The merfolk breaks off their pursuit as the ship sails out of the water and into the sky. Landing the ship on the surface, the crew of the Icy/Hot begins sailing on the surface until they reach the X. It takes the crew six weeks of sailing to make it to the X, but they arrive without losing any more crewmen. With the island right under them, Alberto motions to Edger to freeze the air bubble, and the crew dives under the water again. This time, the sea is quite dark and angry as a storm rage on the water's surface. Under the water, it feels like a volcano is about to erupt, and that's when the crew sees the island and a huge volcano in the middle of the island. The crew lands the ship inside the volcano.

""The volcano lines up with the X on the map. This is the place,"" said Vie, holding up the map. The lower the ship gets into the volcano, the hotter it gets on the ship as well, so hot that Edger is forced to do a cooldown spell every few minutes to keep the crew from passing out. Inside the volcano were chambers filled with gold and jewels. As the Icy/Hot crew searched, they found giant doors big enough to fix a ship. Some crew members jump off the ship to help open the huge doors, but the doors won't budge. The crew returns to the ship and tells the Captain about a small hole in the door. ""It looks like it‚Äôs the size of a key,"" Alberto orders his crew to set sail. The crew searches the volcano until they find one of the rooms filled with gold. As the crew searches the rooms of gold, they are no closer to finding the key. The rooms fill with magma, and all the gold melts away. With the gold gone, Alberto can see the key; however, it is now sitting on top of a mound of magma. The magma begins to take the shape of ten living lava monsters, each standing seven-foot tall and six-foot-wide, making a wall of lava men. The huge lava men now block the key as they move slowly toward the boat. The crew is ready for a fight as Alberto wishes his crewmen buckets of water to defend the ship, and Vie, Edger, and the masked man fight the lava men. Alberto wishes for an ice sword, Edger casts his best freezing spell on the battlefield, and Al wishes for ice weapons for Vie and the masked man. Vie fires an ice arrow, freezing a lava monster solid. Alberto uses his ice sword to freeze the arm of one of the lava men. The masked man, seeing Al needs help, jumps at the lava man, slicing his chest and freezing it solid. Seeing his chance to get the key, Alberto runs past the frozen lava men and grabs the key. The lava man, seeing him, turns around and spits fire at Al.

Dodging the fire, Alberto leaps past the lava men as Vie fires two arrows at the lava monsters, freezing them and allowing Al to escape with Alberto safely away from them. He, Vie, Edger, and the masked man head back to the boat. Edger blocks their fire blasts as the lava men attack with his freezing spell. Seeing Edger about to sacrifice himself, Vie fires an arrow at the ground near the lava men, freezing them. Edger runs to the ship as the ground under his feet dries. As it lifts off, Alberto tosses him a rope; grabbing it‚ÄîEdger dingles from the side of the ship until the crew pulls him up. Sailing to the door, Alberto disembarks the ship and puts the key into the lock, only to be bathed in a blinding blue light.

All Is Well In Hell

¬†

The ship crashed into an abandoned city with broken streets and collapsed buildings. With the sunup, the group heads towards a large statue of the god Zeus. The statue is covered in slime and dust. It is the centerpiece of a large dry fountain. The group walks around the fountain, trying not to get sick from the smell. All the buildings are empty, with the windows blacked out. Walking into one of the buildings, the group sees dusty tables and chairs. With a clean white tablecloth and white place settings on the table, it looks like someone's getting ready for dinner. Alberto finds it hard to think straight inside the building as he can hear voices in his head telling him to walk into the basement. Reaching for the basement door handle, Alberto feels a hand on his shoulder. It‚Äôs the masked man removing his hand from the door. Al enters the kitchen and sees pots and pans full of blood. Exiting the house without touching anything else. Heading back to the ship, the group waits for sundown and is surprised by the sounds of life they hear outside the crashed ship. Looking through one of the portholes, Vie and Edger see men and women with white skin like chalk and pointed ears. Their long white nails, thin and sharp, make them look like ghouls, but just by looking at them, the two can tell they're looking at vampires. Without waiting another minute, Alberto orders the crew off the ship before the vampire‚Äôs board the ship. With the ship on its side, the crew must find a way off before the vampires find them. Alberto wishes the crew was invisible, and they sneak off the ship past the army of vampires that mount the ship, sniffing around for food. The leader of the vampires has deep black eyes and long black hair, with a jacket stained with blood and pants to match. As the lead vampire sniffs the air, he picks up one of Alberto's socks and holds it up so the group can sniff them. As the last of his crew escape the ship, they head into a parking garage and find it full of bones and rotting flesh. Heading up to the top of the parking garage, the group spends a sleepless night on the garage roof. Once the sunrises, the group heads into the streets and looks for a way out of this mad vampire world.

Hearing a voice call to him from the shadows, Alberto turns and sees a little girl waving at him. Al calls for the group to follow the human-looking girl into the alleyway. In the long, narrow alley, Alberto and Vie are attacked by vampires who leap out of the shadows at them. Before Vie or Alberto can act, two men jump off the roof and stake the vampires while Vie captures the little girl. The two men introduce themselves as Sam and his brother Gilbert. Both men have thick beards and faces covered in dirt and soot. The two men lead the group into the subway. ""Hey, wait, you want to go down into the subway? Are you crazy?"" said Vie. Looking back at the group, Sam says, ""There's no time for this look; you can follow us or take your chances up here. You choose?"" After that, everyone follows Sam and Gilbert without a fight as they lead the group into the dark subway tunnels to his secret base. Once they arrive at the underground base, the group is shocked by what they see: men and women running around training to kill vampires. Down in this base, the group is welcomed by two new people; the first is a man named Ross, and the second is his wife, Mary.

They tell the group all about how they found the underground base and started the vampire hunters club. ""Our boys saved you and brought you here so you can help us kill those things that took over our world,"" said Ross. After their talk, the group rests for the night and thinks about what Ross said. In the morning, Alberto Vie and Edger head out with Sam and Gilbert, while the masked man stays with Ross and Mary to look after the rest of the group. In the city, the group finds themselves searching building after building for vampires. If they find the group kills quickly, first they smash all the windows in a building, letting as much light in as possible, then they find the sleeping vampires and stake them in the heart. Back in the base, the masked man asks a few questions of his hosts while helping them cook for the hundred people living underground. ""I just wanted to ask you if you've ever heard about a place called the Vacancy Hotel?"" asked the masked man. Both Ross and Mary share a look as she tells the masked man. ""Yes, I know the hotel you're asking about is where the first vampire originated. It's his base of operations."" With all this new information, the masked man can't wait to talk with Alberto. Meanwhile, Al and the gang find themselves face-to-face with a horde of vampires on the streets. With only a few minutes of sunlight keeping the horde at bay, Alberto must think quickly if he will save the group. Using his sword, Alberto catches the light and fries the remaining vampires. Sam and Gilbert are impressed by Alberto and his group, but with all the excitement of killing vampires, the group loses track of time. Finding the sun going down fast, the group heads back to the subway only to find the path blocked by a large group of vampires. Stopping before they are seen by the vampires, Sam and Gilbert lead the group to a safe house where they can hide. The team sees bare walls and floors inside the safe house, no sign of human life ever having lived here. Al and his group spread out around the safe house. A cold draft enters through one of the windows, and the group is told to stay away from the windows. Sam goes out the back door and tells Gilbert to keep everyone quiet, not letting him go out alone. Alberto goes with Sam. The two head into the backyard and break down the fence. Alberto wishes they looked like vampires so the two could walk around the town without drawing any suspicion. ""How did you make me look like one of them?"" said Sam, looking around to ensure it was safe. Alberto told him. ""It‚Äôs a long story, but magic's real, and me and Edger have it."" As the two men walk around the town, they see vampires walking around with their children like real families. Looking around, Alberto can't wait to leave this place. He and Sam head to the subway to check on Ross, Mary, and everyone else down in the subway. Walking down into the subway, the two men hear moans of pain coming from the base. Running at full speed, Sam and Alberto find the base in ruins. More than a hundred people are dead, including most of the people Alberto brought with him. A hand rises from under the mass of bodies. The hand belongs to Sara. Another hand pops up. This one belongs to Tim, a young man who joined the group in Cloud Burst. Sara and Tim feel sick, and seeing the blood makes them hungry. Sam pulls Alberto back. ""They're vampires. Get back,"" he said. Pulling out a stake to kill the two of them. Alberto pushes Sam away and wishes Sara and Tim could talk to him. With that wish, the two stand up straight and begin to speak. ""I'm so hungry. Feed me. if you love me, then feed me, please!"" As Sam holds his stake tightly, Al wishes for a jar of blood for Sara and hands it to her. She drinks the blood slowly and then passes what's left to Tim. After feeding the two new vampires, calmly tell Alberto and Sam what happened while they were gone. Meanwhile, back at the safe house, young vampires begin knocking on doors. Anyone who doesn‚Äôt answer, the vampires break down the door and search the house. As the vampires reach the safe house, Gilbert and the group prepare for a fight.

The vampires open the door and walk in slowly. Vie fires an arrow at the vampire, hitting one in the shoulder. ""It's us. Calm down,"" said Alberto. Laying Tim on the ground and wishing he and Sam were human again, Alberto rushes Sara into the house. Pulling the Arrow out of Tim's shoulder, Alberto explains what happened to their friends to the group. As Sam and Gilbert cry about their missing mother and father, the group wonders what happened to the masked man. ""I didn't find his body or that of Sam's parents,"" just as the group catches up, the doorknob turns, and a large group of vampire‚Äôs marches in. ""They here, in here,"" said one of the vampires. Vie asks. ""Are they with you?"" Both Alberto and Sam shake their heads no. Vie fires an arrow, hitting one of the vampires in the head. With the vampires swarming into the room, Tim and Sara grab two stakes and begin stabbing the intruders. Edger casts a sleeping spell on the vampires, and the group exits the safe house. After escaping the safe house, Sam and Gilbert lead the group to the vacant hotel. ""If our mom and dad are alive, they are being kept at the vacancy,"" said Sam, holding his brother close. As the group walks the streets, cutting down any vampires they come across, they reach the vacant hotel at sunrise. The huge building stands all black with blacked-out windows and werewolves guarding the doors. Using a pair of bones with pipe bombs taped to them, Sam and Gilbert toss the bones to the werewolves, who scoop them up and are blown to pieces by the pipe bombs. With the wolves taken care of, the group heads into the hotel. Hanging from the ceiling are vampires, dozens sleeping as drool falls from their mouths.

The group moves up the stairs. Seeing all these vampires affects Sara and Tim, who are covered up by blankets. Alberto can see a longing in their eyes to be with their kind. As the group takes the stairs, a roar is heard in front of them. Standing before them was an army of werewolves, some on the ceiling, others clinging to the sidewalls, and all headed for their group. Alberto swings his sword at the monsters, killing three, but just as he kills, one more takes place. Finding a secret passageway behind the stairs, Alberto orders Vie to go with Sam and Gilbert while he and Edger hold off the wolves. As Sam, Gilbert, and Vie run up the stairs, they hear the sounds of death behind them and fear for their friends. The three of them reach a large jail area where they see the masked man, Ross, and Mary in the same cell. Sam quickly unlocks the cells while Vie and Gilbert shut the doors to keep out any wolves or Vampires. Holding his mother and father in his arms, Sam sees the bite marks on their necks. Carrying his mother, Sam asks Gilbert to grab their father. And asks the masked man if he can walk. With a thumbs up, the masked man helps Ross, and the six of them head downstairs. Seeing Vie and Sam exit the secret staircase, Alberto and Edger retreat from the stairs and join their friend‚Äôs downstairs. Looking at the stairs full of dead werewolves, Vie knew Al and Edger could care for themselves. With everyone together, the large group flees the vacant hotel. Heading into the streets just as the sun sets, the group looks for somewhere to hide. Seeing rows of garbage mounds, the group jumps the fence to the dump and hides in the trash for the night. Not wanting to get their injured parents‚Äô wounds infected, Sam and Gilbert look for somewhere clean to put them down. Alberto wishes for some tents and first aid for Sam's mom and dad. Gilbert's look when he sees Alberto use magic is before his brother informs him that Alberto and Edger have magic powers.

¬†""Oh‚Ä¶how nice for you two,"" said Gilbert. Alberto wishes the group a feast of wild hens and mountain boar with a nice craft beer to wash it all down. As the group settles in for the night, the sound of crunching bones is the unmistakable sound of a werewolf. A group of ten younger vampires does the loud yelling and cheering, each looking on as the werewolf disembowels any animal they force to battle it. Looking down at them from the top of a garbage mound, the group thinks of a way out of this situation without anyone finding them. The group finds the werewolf sniffing at their mound as the night wears on while the vampires get drunk on blood and bleach mix. The young vampires feed a bear to the werewolf, and the poor brown bear puts up a little fight before being torn in half by the werewolf. Sam tells his brother not to stand so close to the edge of the garbage mound; however, Gilbert's foot slips too late, and he falls at the feet of the werewolf. The young vampire cheers, jumping down after Gilbert. Alberto cuts one of the vampires in half. Edger casts a sleep spell on the werewolf while Vie fills three vampires with arrows. The six remaining vampires back up to a wall before Tim and Sara try to talk with the vampires. ""Human lovers."" Spit one of the vampires. Tim rips the head off the vampire that said that, forcing the others to stand and fight. Al uses his sword to cut through most of the remaining vampires as Vie fires her arrows, killing the last vampire. After burning the bodies and skinning the werewolf to make a blanket for Mary, the group rests for the night. They leave Ross and Mary behind in the morning and return to the hotel. Wishing for some sun-light guns for everyone in the group, the masked man is first inside the room. With the vampires still cleaning up the dead werewolves, no one sees the group enter. As the group prepares to attack, the vampires turn around to face them. Blasting the vampires with their sunlight guns, they burn to a crisp quickly.

New werewolves block their path to the head vampire when heading up the stairs. Dropping their guns, the group begins fighting the wolves with swords, bows, and handguns. The masked man cuts three werewolves' heads off but is bitten by one and falls down the stairs. Alberto wishes the group some shields and then checks on the masked man. Helping him back to his feet, Alberto takes the masked man outside and tells him to go back to the dump and wait with Ross and Mary. Meanwhile, inside the hotel, Vie, Edger, Sam, and Gilbert fight their way past the wolves and are greeted by an army of vampires. In the center of this army stands the head vampire in his golden robes and blood-stained under-shirt. As Alberto rejoins the group for this last fight, both sides clash, and Alberto tries to cut his way to the head vampire. Vie stands behind Edger, who puts up his shield and casts a fire spell. Vie fires flaming arrows from behind Edger's shield and hits a few vampires. Sam and Gilbert use their light guns to burn a path to the head vampire. The head vampire retreats farther into the hotel, with the battle heating up. As he flees, Alberto follows him. Sam and Gilbert try to follow, but the head vampire's followers block the way up. As Alberto follows the head vampire up the stairwell, he catches up with him, and the two fight on the stairs. The fight seems to last forever as the head vampire claws his eye out, and Alberto cuts off the vampire's hand. The two exchange blows for a while until Vie and the gang arrive. Edger casts a freezing spell on the head vampire as Vie puts an arrow through his heart, killing him. With the head vampire dead, the spell he casts on the werewolves and vampires is broken. The group heads up to the roof to watch the sunrise, all but Sara, who chooses to stay behind and help the vampires rebuild their society. Tim heads to the dump with Edger to fetch Ross and Mary, not forgetting the masked man who snuck back into the hotel to aid in the fight. Ross and Mary arrive just in time to watch the sunrise, and they all pass out as it rises.¬†¬†

¬†

Epilogue: Walking up to his bed, Alberto wonders if it was a dream. As he walks around his empty apartment, looking at the photos of his ex-wife, Alberto is shocked by a sound he hears in the bathroom. His ex-wife's favorite song is playing in the bathroom. Knocking on the door, Alberto stands face-to-face with his wife. Naked, she wraps her arms around him and kisses him. ""How was work, honey,"" she asks. Alberto takes a long look at her naked body before asking. ""What about Steve?"" his wife looking somewhat confused. ""Who's Steve? Is he a friend of yours?"" asks Alberto's wife, holding her in his arms. ""By the way, your mother and father want to have us over for dinner tonight,"" she said. Alberto doesn't care what world this is for him; it‚Äôs home.¬†¬†¬†

We were on the fence for so long and then it happened without trying in the beginning of 2021.  I felt very strange and felt very happy for once like things were finally falling into place.  But that would all go away in two weeks and it was way more painful than usual.  


I went to the gyno to tell him about this and he thought there was nothing unusual and I should have no trouble conceiving in the next few months.  Three years passed and there's been a big fat nothing.  Not even that strange feeling I had before.  I should have scheduled another gyno appointment a year after the last one but I was too much of a wimp.  In spring 2024, I got an email that my gyno is retiring.  I took that as my sign to finally open up about this.  Again, he wasn't seeing anything strange on his end but since it had been three years without anything, he ordered up some blood work for my and a SA for my husband.  


Collecting a sample was much more awkward than we thought.  We thought we had enough but we had to pay almost $400 for them to tell us it wasn't enough.  My blood work came back all normal except for a consistent very elevated 17-oh progesterone which they said is a contributing factor.  When I opened up to this to a long time friend she just said, ""If you're stressed about money now, what do you think a baby would do? I don't know why you want a baby anyway with Trump back in office.  And oh, you won't get to do your cool art and hobbies anymore after you have a baby.""


Anyway, right before the gyno retired he referred me to the RE.  The appointment is finally coming up in two weeks to look at everything and it looks like SA is significantly cheaper at that facility too.  I am very nervous about the appointment.  I want there to be something we can do.  I want a Dr to give me a real answer about my diet, exercise, and black coffee consumption.  I know I need to lose the 25 pounds I gained in the past few years and then the other stubborn pounds.  I get afraid of dieting/exercising too hard so the scale stays the same.  I know I probably drink too much coffee but no one's given me an answer about how much to drink when trying to conceive.  At least I managed to lose interest in alcohol during this process.  The old gyno didn't see them as being factors that would affect this.  


This whole process is eating me alive.  It seems like everyone around me left and right is getting knocked up.  Whenever my mom calls, it's always to ask if I'm having a baby yet.  And when I say no and sound sad, she says I should have a baby to help with the sadness.  My MIL also asks but is more sympathetic.  And if we say no, she says it's better not to in this political environment with all the woke stuff.  


I just feel like a complete failure of a woman.  Apparently J.D. Vance thinks so too.  I do my best to make the holidays nice for my husband and for my inner child but deep done I feel like I am continually doing the holidays wrong without a child or big family to celebrate with.  I feel this every year.  My husband is sad about this too but it's not eating him up. I feel like I can't talk about this with anyone without getting my head bitten off.

Opening his eyes, Alberto sees himself back at home in his one-bedroom apartment in upstate New York. Walking out of his bedroom, Alberto sees Vie and Edger sleeping together on his sofa. Waking the two of them up, Al walks into the kitchen and makes breakfast. Eggs and bacon are a wonderful treat. After so long in the wild, the three share war stories as they eat, and Alberto checks his answering machine. Al sits on the sofa and watches some T.V. with no messages until a P.S.A. comes on the T.V., and everyone gathers around to see it. On-screen, a man wearing a fine blue suit and holding a gun begins to talk about safety and comfort. He talks about how you can't have one without the other, reads a list of names, and says these people threaten public safety. ""Fucking gun nuts,"" said Alberto turning off the T.V. and going outside. It all feels the same when heading into the world, with men and women waving and enjoying the fresh air. Alberto heads to a local park while Vie and Edger head to the supermarket for food. At the park, Alberto sees a group of schoolchildren throwing stones at a gay man, and he steps in.

""Cut that out, you little brats, and I should tell your mothers about this!"" Alberto said, grabbing the hands of one of the children. As the kids scattered, one yelled back at Alberto, ""Burn in hell, foreigner!!!"" as the kids ran from Alberto, he helped the gay man to his feet and asked why t those brats attacked. ""If I try to fight back, they will just call their parents and make things worse for me,"" said the man who calls himself Kicks. Vie and Edger hold hands at the supermarket to the disgusted looks of many passersby. Walking into the market, the two see a homeless man beaten by two police officers almost to death. Stepping in to help the man, Vie and Edger are shocked at the cruelty of the police officers who look at the interracial couple and motion to each other. Both Vie and Edger are arrested. Once the sun goes down, Alberto makes his way home with the Kick, who he invites over to have dinner with him, Vie, and Edger. Walking into the apartment only to find it empty, Al looks around momentarily and checks to see if they are sleeping in his room.

After looking everywhere in the apartment and not finding his friends' hide or hair, Alberto wishes for dinner for himself and Kicks. After dinner, Alberto turns on the news and hears a list of today's enemies. At the end of the long list of names, Alberto hears Vie and Edger's names read and jumps off the sofa. Alberto runs out of the house and sees men and women taking guns and torches to the streets, looking for Jews, Gays, Foreigners, and the mentally ill. Looking around, Alberto sees swastika flags hanging from buildings and Nazi officers walking the streets. Alberto wishes for something to cover up his appearance. Once disguised, Alberto takes to the streets, looking for Vie and Edger. As Kicks knows his way around town, he two puts on a disguise and joins Al in the search.

Telling Alberto that anyone on the enemies list is taken to the rehab center for reconditioning. Walking up to the walls of the enormous reconditioning center, Alberto and Kicks see men and women being brought in and body bags on trucks being brought out. The smell of burning flesh fills the air for a mile in every direction. Without warning, a man in a Nazi uniform walks up to Alberto and Kicks and questions him in German. Wishing he spoke German, Alberto responds. ""We were just trying to find our way to the bus stop. Might you know the way, sir?"" looking the two men up and down, the officer points to a bus stop across the street and speaks. ""The two of you seem like you might be more comfortable on a train,"" he says with a smile on his chubby red face. Standing at the bus stop, the two men discuss infiltrating the facility. ""Are you crazy? You want to get into that place?"" said Kicks. The two sit on the back of the gray and black bus in dirty and broken seats, then get off at Alberto's apartment. The apartment building looks disgusting in the daylight, with bloody crusty floors and moldy ceilings. Alberto was so glad to be home that he never noticed how awful the building smelled and looked. Heading back upstairs, Alberto shows Kicks to his guest bedroom.

After three days of developing a plan, Alberto puts his plan into action. Wishing he and Kicks looked like Nazi guards, Alberto heads to the rehab. Center, where he and Kicks access the facility and look around for Vie and Edger. With their faces masked by magic to look like blonde-haired, blue-eyed Nazis, Alberto, and Kicks, walks inside the facility and don‚Äôt draw a glance from anyone around them. Wishing for a pair of I.D.s to get past the security fence, both men head to the prison yard, where they see Edger being beaten by two officers, and Alberto steps in. ""STOP!!! The warden wants to see this one and the girl he came in with!"" said Alberto with some backbone in his tone. The two officers salute Al and lead him into the female section of the rehab center. Inside the facility, Alberto and Kicks see Gay Men and the Mentally Ill being locked in cages like animals. They see Jews and Black men being led to a shooting gallery chained together. The men can't fight back. One of the guards, seeing Alberto's face, tells him.

""Those men have been here two years, and we need to make room for new meat,"" he said with a wink. Once they reach the women's section, Alberto and Kicks look around for Vie. Asking one of the guards about her, they find out she has been taken to the warden's office already. Acting as if they are not surprised, Kicks and Alberto lead Edger to the warden's office. ""You two get back to work,"" standing outside the warden's office, Alberto tells Kicks to wait with Edger. Walking into the warden's office without knocking, Alberto sees the man on top of Vie and pulls him off her forcefully. ""What are you doing, officer!!!"" Stepping back, Alberto responds, ""I thought you fell over, sir,"" looking Alberto up and down, the warden asks, ""Who are you, and why are you in my office?"" Thinking quickly, Alberto tells the warden, ""I was told your wife was looking for you, and I should come and fetch you‚Ä¶sir,"" pulling up his pants and buttoning his shirt, the warden orders Alberto to take Vie out of his office. Helping Vie put on her clothes, the two leave the office, and she turns and slaps him.

""You bring my boyfriend here to humiliate me,"" says Vie before Alberto and Kicks reveal themselves. ""It's me, Alberto. I'm here to save you two."" Al and Kicks lead Vie and Edger to a guard station when an alarm goes off, and the three start to run. With guards behind them and in front of them, Alberto wishes them some guns and ammo. Firing at the guards in front of them, the group keeps running and reaches the yard where they are surrounded. Alberto wishes all the guard's guns were plastic and all the inmates were free and out on the streets with guns. With that, all hell breaks loose as inmates begin killing people, and guards hide for their lives, wishing he and his friends were at his grandmother's house in Puerto Rico. Alberto finds that even San Juan has changed with the flag of the empire of Japan in place of the Puerto Rican flag and Japanese soldiers walking around checking IDs. Once night falls, Alberto finds the group a place to sleep.

The small Japanese cottage takes guests, and Alberto books a room for four with some German money he wishes for. The man who runs the cottage speaks perfect Spanish and looks like a local, but Alberto is too tired to ask about his grandmother. In the morning, Vie and Edger bring coffee and rice balls for breakfast. ""This was all they had for breakfast. Sorry, you two,"" said Vie, setting down the plate of rice balls and pouring four cups of coffee. Edger sits on the floor on a mat, just like everyone else, and also takes the time to explain why he seems to be living in feudal Japan. ""So, after the Nazis won the war, they took over the white countries and gave all the black and brown countries to Italy and Japan. The Japanese then imposed feudalism on all their colonies while the country of Japan kept modernizing,"" said Edger. Looking around the room, Alberto and Vie shook their heads as they did not fit their current living situation. After eating, Alberto heads to town to find out any info about his grandmother. The town itself is smaller than Alberto remembers from childhood. San Juan was once a huge city with so many people, but now it is small and full of horses and Japanese soldiers. The houses are small, with wooden fireplaces and large wooden hot tubs. Walking the dirt road, Alberto sees men and women working in small shops and others heading into the woods to chop down trees. After asking around at a few shops, Alberto is led by a girl named Erica to his grandmother's house.

The sight of his grandmother's house is shocking. The outside is boarded up, and the yard is overgrown and uncared for. Seeing this, Alberto pulls away the boards and walks into the house, yelling his grandmother's name. The inside of the house is burned, and there's no sign of any living people inside the house. Not waiting for Erica, Alberto heads back to the cabin. There, he finds Vie and Edger kissing on the floor, with no sign of Kicks. Alberto heads back outside to look for him. Kicks stand in a small park next to a koi pond. A tall tan man with a thick accent there approaches him. ""Hello, do you mind if I join you?"" said the man. Looking into his deep brown eyes, Kick is lost for words and only slides over so the man can sit beside him. Alberto searches everywhere for kicks but finds no one and returns home before sundown. They're sitting at the table with Kicks, a strange man Al's never seen before. The five of them have dinner and a few drinks, then Kicks and the other man, who calls himself Carlos, leave for Carlos's apartment. Looking out the window, Al sees Erica. She seems to be speaking with two Japanese soldiers and pointing to his window.

The two soldiers knock on Alberto's door a minute later, questioning where he came from and when he'll leave San Juan. Wishing for the proper paperwork, Alberto shows it to the soldiers, and they turn to leave. Alberto watches them go and sees them drag the girl Erica away. The T.V. seems to turn on by itself, and an ad for the Vacancy Hotel appears. Seeing the ad, all three of them know where the exit to the Nazi world is. Waiting for Kicks to return, the group fills him in on what they plan to do next. Hearing about the multi-verse fills Knicks's head with excitement and a little fear, knowing they could wind up in one of many different worlds.

Kicks asks for one more day to decide if he goes or stays, saying he wants to invite Carlos to accompany him. The group understands and tells him to take the day off. Meeting back up at the koi pond, Kicks and Carlos sit and talk about what is happening with them. ""I like you, but we just started dating, and if the soldiers find out about us, they'll kill us both,"" said Carlos, looking away from Kicks towards the koi pond. ""I know it's soon, but I want to escape all this. Don't you ever want to be free to be yourself in a world where people accept you for who you are?"" Kicks says as he leans in to kiss Carlos, seeing these two soldiers grab the two men and take them away. The sun rises, and a loud knock on the door wakes Vie and Edger. Both of them roll out of bed and open the door. The Japanese soldiers flood the room and arrest everyone, even dragging Alberto out of bed. At the prison, Alberto and his friends are shown pictures of Vie and Edger with video of the riots in New York. The riots have begun to spread to other states and cities nationwide. After a lengthy interrogation, the three discover that Kicks was arrested and told the soldiers about them to save Carlos.

Alberto wishes the prison guards were all frozen solid, then he, Vie, and Edger walk around and look for Kicks. Inside the substantial prison, men and women are half-starved and locked away. Alberto, seeing his people suffer, makes another wish. ""I wish the Americans had won the war in this world!!!"" A huge puff of smoke overtakes Alberto, who opens his eyes and is back in San Juan, but this time in his grandmother's house. Al runs to the kitchen and sees his grandma cooking coming in from outside Vie and Edger. The group heads to the Vacancy Hotel, but Alberto makes another wish before they go. The local Carlos sits on a beach, and Kicks asks for directions. ""Hi, I don't know what I'm doing here in Puerto Rico. One minute, I was in my house. The next, I was at the beach. Can you help me get to the airport?"" the two men share a look, then walk off the beach. Alberto books a room at the hotel for the three of them and Al, Vie, and Edger head upstairs.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

A TROLL TOLL

¬†

Waking up in a forest of purple and blue trees, Alberto, Vie, and Edger stand up and see pointy-eared children running around. ""More elves, great,"" said Alberto. With no time to think, Al is swarmed by the mass of little men who tie them up and drag the three of them to their village. The villages are small in height but large in width. The elves all take turns painting the group members and tearing off their clothes, and the group stands naked before a large elf man with green skin and pointy ears. The man picks up Alberto and spins him around while speaking elvish. From an earlier wish, Alberto just so happens to talk to elvish. And translates for the rest of the group, ""he says he's glad to have us as his guests, and he hopes we can help them with a problem they are having,"" said Alberto to Vie and Edger. Wishing the group some clothes, Alberto wishes himself a gold cloak, a gold shirt, and red pants. His black boots fit comfortably. He wishes Edger and Vie a silver shirt and pants with strong black boots. ""Hey, where's my cloak?"" asked Edger. Wishing for two sparkling black cloaks for Vie and Edger, the group looks for a place to eat in the village. The chief of the village invites them to eat with him. At the feast, the elves play the drums louder and louder until a roar fills the air.

Outside, women and men scream as a half-lion, half-scorpion monster bursts into the camp. The creature impales an elf woman with its tail, then scoops one of the elves up in its pincers and cuts it in half. Alberto pulls out his sword and wishes Edger his staff back and a bow for Vie. Together, the three begin attacking the monster. Edger uses his staff to blind the creature as Vie fires arrows into its eyes. The monster yells in pain, and Alberto leaps up, cutting into its tail. Copping off the monster's tail, Alberto is drenched in black monster blood. As the lion scorpion stumbles around, Edger hits it with a freezing blast, turning it to ice. The elves look around at the giant frozen monster, and the children in the village climb on top of the icy creature, playing and jumping up and down on it.

The village chief once again orders the music to play and the feast to begin again. ""So now that your troubles have been dealt with, I guess you can just let us go,"" said Alberto. As the elves begin laughing, the chief explains, ""The chimera was a big problem for the village, but the biggest problem we deal with, and the one we needed your help with, is the Troll king."" The chief explains every year, and they must pay a troll toll to the king to keep him from invading their lands. After a long night with the chief explaining what he needs from the group of travelers and offering them a map that leads to Vacancy Mountain, Alberto, Vie, and Edger all agree to hunt down and kill the Troll King. In the morning, the three travelers head to Billy-goat, the road leading to the troll kingdom. After walking for an hour down the Billy-goat path, the group stops at a stone bridge. From under the bridge slowly moves a considerable hand, the purple hand covered in boils. As the rest of the troll comes out from under the bridge, the sun causes it to burn up, and the troll retreats under the bridge. Seeing a chance to get information, Alberto wishes for some rope and lets the sun hit his hand, turning it to stone.

After punching a few stones out of the bridge, Al makes a lasso with the rope and throws it around the troll's neck. The three of them together pull the rope and lift the purple troll out of his lair; as his skin burns, the troll screams out in pain. ""What do you want from me, human scum,"" said the troll. Lowering the troll back into its hole, the group questions it. ""Are you the Troll king?"" asked Vie, holding an arrow over the hole. ""No, no, I swear it. I am Toll-Got, and I live under this bridge. Please don't hurt me,"" said the fearful Toll-Got. After a long time questioning the troll, the group learns that the Troll king lives in a vast palace hidden by magic in the woods and that they are on the road to his army camp. Once the sun sets, Alberto and his group leave the bridge and walk into the woods. After walking through the woods for a few hours, the group stops to camp for the night. Wishing for camping gear and a nice turkey dinner, the group rests after filling their stomachs. The night passes without a sound filling the air, and the group wakes refreshed.

Opening the tent, Vie screams at the top of her lungs as the bloody sight fills her eyes. A warning is written in the blood of Toll-Got, the troll's head on the floor and his body in pieces scattered throughout the trees. A note attached to the tent tells the group to turn back now or face the wrath of the Troll King. Alberto packs up their camp quickly, and the group continues on their journey to kill the Troll King. Vie gets hungry at midday and wants to go hunting. Edger and Al agree they could use some fresh meat. Seeing a small boar, Vie aims at it, hitting the boar in the leg. As it cries out in pain, a huge boar knocks down two trees and charges for the group. With its long black hair and large white tusks, the red boar heads straight for Vie, who jumps out of the way at the last minute. Edger uses his staff to throw a fireball at the boar, but the beast but the boar shakes the attack off as if magic does not affect the boar. Alberto, wanting to end this fight, quickly wishes the boar away but finds himself unable to want anything while the boar is near as the words get stuck in his mouth. As Vie keeps attacking the Boar with her arrows that seem to do almost no damage, Alberto and Edger fall back to think of new ways to help.

Alberto climbs a tree, hoping to let the daylight hit his hand and turn it to stone as Edger takes Al's sword and hacks at the boar's legs. While the sword has the power to cut through the stone, it behaves like a normal sword, only slicing at the boar's feet and not cutting through the bone. At the top of the giant tree, Alberto sticks his hand straight up, and it turns to stone. Jumping down from the tree and landing on the boar's back, Al cracks a few of its bones as the boar flees into the woods. With the boar gone, Vie and Edger stop to rest, and Alberto wishes for three bowls of soup for them. Sitting under a large tree with a crooked trunk, Alberto thinks about their plan of attack. ""The Troll king knows we're coming. We can't hide in the forest forever. We need a better plan of attack."" Just as they get their things together, a group of small goblins enter their camp and steal their weapons. Chasing after the goblins, Vie and Edger go one way, and Alberto follows a group of goblins the other way. As Al reaches a large group of trees, he is hit in the throat by a large seven-foot-tall hobgoblin; the orange and crooked-nosed creature stands over Alberto and laughs as the tiny goblins hide behind him. The hobgoblin picks Al up with one hand and tosses him across the forest. Alberto punches the hobgoblin with his hand still made of stone, sending him flying with a huge stick. The hob-goblin attacks Al, who uses his hand to shield himself, breaking the stick with his hand.

While all this is happening, Vie and Edger are still chasing the little goblins that have their gear. As they reach a small lake, they are surrounded by a pack of wolves. The giant gray and white wolves almost eclipse Vie and Edger with their massive size. The wolves tear into the little goblins, chewing them to bits. Picking up their weapons, Vie and Edger fight off the wolves. Vie fires an arrow at the biggest wolf, and Edger casts a fire spell to scare them off. All but the biggest wolf runs from the fire. The alpha wolf bites down on Edger's hand, and he drops his staff.

Vie fires an arrow at the wolf and hits it in the leg. The wolf releases Edger and turns to attack Vie, but as the wolf gets closer, Vie readies another Arrow. Firing at the wolf as it bears down on her, Vie kills the wolf, shooting it in the eye. Heading over to check on Edger, Vie crawls over to where Edger is resting. As Alberto continues his fight with the hobgoblin, the large monster puts up a better fight than Al thought it would. The hobgoblin pounds Alberto as Al tries to fight him off with his stone hand. The huge orange monster bites Alberto's neck, picking up a sharp rock.

Alberto stabs the hobgoblin in the face repeatedly. As the hob-goblin retreats from the fight, Alberto picks up his sword from the ground and begins to chase after the hobgoblin. As the injured hobgoblin runs through the forest, its green blood falls to the ground. Following the blood trail the hob-goblin leaves, Alberto finds a group of hobgoblins waiting for him. The six other hobgoblins stand over the dead body of their fallen friend and pull out their swords. Unable to speak, Al is forced to flee the fight by jumping into the nearby river. As the raging river takes him away from the hobgoblins, the powerful current forces Alberto under the water. With water filling his lungs, Al has no choice but to try and fight the current. With water overwhelming him, Alberto begins drowning and passes out. Washing up on a shore, a group of elves drag Al's body away from the riverbed. After Vie and Edger rest briefly, they head back to where they last saw Alberto and yell for him. After searching for a few hours, Vie and Edger give up the search and try to build their camp. The two camp for the night using a few large sticks and vines. In a makeshift teepee, the two try to fall asleep. Alberto wakes up inside the elf village when he sees these blue elves. A female chief leads the elves. She orders Alberto to be tied up and taken to a hut to sleep for the night. In the morning, Al is bathed in rose petals and dried with wildflowers by the women in the village. One of the women, Star, visits Alberto daily to ensure he's not getting sick.

Star also shows Al around the village, taking him to their rock gardens and showing him the waterfall where they make a sacrifice to their god. After a long village tour, Alberto returns to his enclosed hut, locked in by the village's women. Once the sun goes down, the women of the village go hunting. Seeing his chance to escape, Alberto breaks the wooden bars in the window and climbs through the window. Chewing through the rope around his wrist, Alberto begins to see shapes and colors in the night sky. Alberto stumbles through the forest with a strange liquid in his mouth that coats the rope. Seeing a huge frog the size of a tree sitting on a lily pad, Al runs from the beast. Heading in the opposite direction, he sees a dragonfly the size of a car. As the forest keeps spinning, and Alberto looks around, watching the trees change color, he shuts his eyes and falls asleep. Opening his eyes, Alberto sees the village women capturing him and returning him to captivity. Star tells Alberto that the women of the Village use polio sap to keep their captives weak, and if the sap gets in your mouth, it can make you see things. Being trapped back in the village, only this time in a large hole with a door at the top, Alberto starts to come down off the sap high. Looking through the small gaps in the wood that make up the door. Al can see the village women getting ready to make a sacrifice. Watching as they gather up large mounds of dirt, pull large numbers of ants free from the earth, and gather them up to fill the hole.

Alberto gets his voice back as the women toss the ant-filled dirt into his hole. Alberto wishes himself free of the hole. Standing before the women of the tribe, Al wishes for his sword and begins cutting the elf women to pieces. As the elves‚Äô scatter and flee from him, Vie and Edger enter the village and see Al. Seeing his friends, Alberto ends his attack on the elf women and leaves the village with Vie and Edger. After explaining what happened in the village, Alberto wishes for a tent and sleeps for the night. In the morning, the three follow a river to the nearest town and meet with the Mayor. The city of Hamlet is rather large, considering its isolation, but it seems full of life and close to the river. Walking into the Mayor's residence, the group sees a young woman sitting on the Mayor's lap. Thinking of the girl as his daughter, Alberto says hello only to the girl as she kisses the mayor on the mouth. The fat old Mayor stands up and shakes hands with Alberto before pouring four drinks for the group and himself. ""I know what you're here for,"" said the Mayor, smoking a fine cigar. ""You want help defeating the troll king,"" he finished. After talking with the mayor for a few hours, he agrees to send some guards to help kill the Troll King. After a few days in town, the mayor's guards arrive, and the group takes off. With the addition of one-hundred-foot soldiers, Alberto, Vie, and Edger take off down the road to the troll king's castle.

The land that surrounds the Troll king's land is filled with dead trees and hanging bodies of the dead. As they walk down the long winding Alberto, wanting to arrive soon and make camp, wishes everyone a horse. After riding for a few hours, the group sees the Troll King's castle and prepares to camp. The group rests in their tents at night as the footmen protect the horses. Hearing a sound in the forest, the footmen head into the woods and see one of the horses being eaten by an Orc. Out of the woods comes an army of Orc's led by a massive Orc. The huge six-foot-tall beast of a creature holds a massive skull-shaped AX and howls for his fellow Orc's to join him. As the woods fill with Orc's, the footmen fall into position and prepare for battle. In less than ten minutes, the footmen are standing by as the Orc's fills the air with a wild chant. In the middle of the night, the two sides clashed. The footmen are overwhelmed by the sheer force of the Orc army. As Edger and Vie enter the fight, the tide begins to turn. With Alberto of the front lines cutting Orc's in half, Edger uses a few spells to slow down the Orc army. Vie fires her arrows one after the other and kills ten Orcs in a few minutes. After summoning a lightning storm, Edger kills the last of the Orc's and saves the army from defeat. After the battle, the group breaks camp and heads to the Troll king's castle. In front of the Troll, King's castle stands over five thousand trolls of different sizes and colors. Each group is separated by color, with the yellow and blue Trolls being the largest and kept in the center. The red and purple were the slimmest and fastest, so they were held on the flanks of the battle line. With the reaming blue and green trolls standing behind the battle line, Alberto's group has their work cut out for them in this battle.

Thinking quickly, Alberto wishes for some allies to join them in the battle with hundreds of elves and many more humans. Also, by his side are the masked man and all his friends. Edger uses his powers to summon six rock guards, each with a large stone AX. The army of troll‚Äôs advances like a tidal wave as the battle begins. As the two sides collide, the humans hold on for dear life, hacking and slashing at the advancing trolls. The rock guards pound the ground with their axes, killing everything in their path, but the rest of the army has trouble holding on as the troll‚Äôs attack in force. Alberto cuts through a huge group of trolls with his rock sword and Vie leads a small group of archers to a high hill, and they fire at the trolls from far away. Edger casts a confusing spell on the troll army, and some begin attacking each other. With all this confusion on the battlefield, Alberto takes this chance to sneak into the castle. With Vie and Edger commanding the battle, Al takes the masked man, and the two sneak around the battlefield and enter the castle through a side entrance. Finding the side door open, Alberto and the masked man head into the castle and find it empty. Walking up a huge staircase, Al and the Masked man are attacked from above by Orc's who jump from the rafters.

5As they fight the Orc's, swords in hand, the huge, bulky Orc's use AXs and mace to defend themselves. In the heat of the battle, Alberto is struck in the head by a mace. The Masked man responds by killing the Orc who attacked Alberto and three other Orc's who are nearby. The leader of the Orc clan is called Greed Orc, and he stands seven feet tall with a large scar that runs down his face to his chest. The large gray Orc wears no armor and carries a huge battle AX as he and the masked man fight the rest of the Orc's stand and watch. The masked man twists from Greed Orc's grasp and slashes at the Orc's arm. The large Orc pounds the ground with his AX, getting it stuck in the staircase, as the masked man stabs him in the belly. Still groggy from the blow to his head, Alberto tries to stand up only to see the masked man fighting the giant Orc, making a wish Al sees as the Orc's turns into a dog.

The Orc's dealt with Al, and the masked man kept moving forward. Reaching the top of the stairs, the two men see the Troll King sitting on his massive throne. The wide gold throne stands eight-foot-tall with gold statues of naked troll women all around the throne. On the throne sits the king, a fat troll with foot all over his robes. The green troll stands up and speaks. ""Who dares invade my land?"" he asked. The two men stand back in case of an ambush and speak. ""We come on behalf of the elf villagers you demand a troll toll from. They finished paying you!!!"" the Troll King laughs and pulls out a sword made of solid gold. As the three men clash, the Troll King puts up a good fight, sending Alberto and the masked man flying into a wall with one blow. As they both get up from the attack, the Troll King turns into a deer and runs out of the castle. The green-skinned deer runs into the middle of the battle, and Alberto and the masked man head back to the battlefield. Vie and Edger battle a giant troll holding a club in the middle of the battle. The enormous blue troll stands sixteen feet tall and owns a club made of a fallen tree. As Vie fills the giant troll with arrows, Edger casts a weather spell to make it rain on the battlefield. The heavy trolls, including the giant troll, begin to sink in the mud. The smaller trolls continue the fight. In his deer form, the Troll king reaches the woods and breaks for it. Seeing this, Alberto wishes he and the masked man were eagles. As the two score over the battlefield and head into the woods, they find the Troll King and turn back into men. Jumping down onto the Troll King in his deer form, Al and the masked man attack the deer.

As the Troll King returns to his proper form, Alberto and the masked man prepare for a fight. The Troll King uses his magic and casts a spell of confusion. As the spell takes hold, Alberto goes blind, unable to see. Al has no way of fighting back when the Troll King attacks him. The masked man, also blind, uses his other senses to stab the Troll King in the chest, killing the king. Feeling their king's death, the rest of the troll‚Äôs surrender. The elves make peace with the new Troll queen, the old king's sister. With ease in the elf village, Alberto is given the map to the Vacancy mountains.",1,1733015507.0,shortstorywriting,0,1.0,False
