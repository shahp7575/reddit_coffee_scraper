1oedodb,https://i.redd.it/rd89cpgc4xwf1.jpeg,Dentist said she hadn't seen a case like mine in 20 years...,"**Current situation:** Two days ago, my left back molar on the bottom (tooth 37) was found to have a ""huge cavity"" based on x-ray and initial probing with whatever the pokey metal things are. It was so huge that my dentist said we might need to do a root canal, but to come back ASAP to investigate further, and maybe it would just need a filling.  
  
Today, she found significant ""erosion,"" but my dentist said it **was not a cavity**. In fact, I have never had a cavity in my life! The erosion is primarily at the point between two roots on the outer side of the tooth, and is so bad that the nerve was exposed. She did the filling (and put medical dressing), and to do so she had to scrape away gum tissue that had grown into the new space. She said this was a very fast progression that is known to happen rarely, but that there is no consensus in the dental community about why. She used the word erosion, but then also said that erosion isn't quite the right word.



**Context:** I was last at the dentist about 13-14 months prior, and last had x-rays 2 years prior. I was pregnant at my last appointment, and my baby is now 12.5 months old. This tooth did have some gum recession already. At the last appointment, she scanned for sensitivity with her implement, but it was fine. In the last year, the tooth did develop sensitivity. With the baby, no family support, and waiting for insurance benefits to kick in, this week was the soonest I was able to get back to the dentist. Acid erosion factors don't seem to apply, ex. I don't consume a lot of acidic or sugary drinks (just a basic cup of coffee, no soft drinks), and don't suffer from acid reflux or bulimia.



**Next steps??:** My dentist said, in general, that the future of this tooth is pretty uncertain/negative. There is a small chance that I'll have reduced sensitivity, and could get by with just the filling for an indefinite period of time. We will check in on Monday about it. But, she also said that because the root was exposed, and if the sensitivity is worse/doesn't go away, a root canal might be the way to go (and a crown to prevent cracking). A ""solution for life"" would be to go with extraction and implant.

  
**Questions:** I have never heard of this sort of thing, so to me it's all new. Have any dental professionals here heard of this rapid progression of tooth loss? Is extraction the best route if I can find a way to afford it? Am I at all likely to have this happen to another tooth? I asked my dentist if pregnant/nursing was a factor, and she said it's so rare that there aren't good stats on coinciding factors. Please help me gain context for this issue. I'm scared.

I have few qualms about the local Episcopal Church but am leaving due to the service time not really working with my Sunday work schedule and feeling disconnected or wanting in some way from the church since Covid.  I will miss the liturgical services but the church also feels stuffy. 

Part of the reason I am changing is I found a lovely urban and liberal Methodist church that is in my neighborhood and that has an earlier service time that works with my work schedule (and can still do coffee hour). What also drew me to this church is its open and affirming attitudes (first service I attended involved LGBTQ members),  history of outreach in its urban neighborhood and its social justice in the current political climate. Also finding out that the church has a wonderful choir and music program (better than the EC). The folks are friendly too!

Has anyone else switched for Episcopal to Methodist? Were there things you missed from your former church? Are you happier in your current place? Looking around Reddit it feels like folks have went in the other direction (probably due in part to the recent LGBTQ decisions by the UMC).

So, like 3‚Äì4 months ago, I was on Grindr (shocker, I know). I‚Äôm 23 and I started talking to this guy who was about 30. He seemed nice said he was looking for something long-term, and was giving ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got my life together‚Äù energy.

He picked me up, took me to a nice restaurant, we had a decent time, kissed afterwards (all fine). But something about him felt‚Ä¶ off. Not like red-flag-off, just weirdly off. I couldn‚Äôt explain it.

After the date, I tried texting him, but the responses were dry. Like ‚Äúoh, I‚Äôm busy,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired,‚Äù ‚Äúmaybe later‚Äù ‚Äî you get the idea. Then, out of nowhere, a month later he‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm free now, wanna hang out?‚Äù 

We chilled in his car, made out, grabbed some food , nothing wild, just vibes. But he kept being inconsistent with communication so I just blocked him and moved on with my life.

Now, fast forward a bit, I‚Äôm on Tinder this time. Match with this guy, 33, recently out of a relationship. He tells me he‚Äôs ‚Äújust figuring things out,‚Äù which is usually code for ‚ÄúI‚Äôm emotionally unavailable,‚Äù but whatever, he was fun to talk to.

We meet for coffee, the conversation‚Äôs great, and he‚Äôs honestly kinda charming. Later, he‚Äôs in town for work and invites me to his hotel. We have dinner, go back to his room, make out, cuddle it‚Äôs cute.

Then we start talking. About life, dating, exes you know, deep post-makeout convos. And when he starts describing his ex, I swear my jaw dropped. The more he talked, the more it hit me:

He was talking about the same guy I went on dates with before.

Same facial features. Same ‚Äúweirdly normal but not normal‚Äù vibe. Same everything. Apparently, they had a messy breakup something about cheating, drama, mental health issues, the works.

And there I am, lying in this dude‚Äôs hotel bed, realizing I‚Äôve accidentally dated both halves of a gay breakup.

I didn‚Äôt tell him, obviously. Just smiled, nodded and internally screamed.

Next day? Blocked. Both of them.

FYI I live in a small city so gay community is small

1oedn0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Jumpy_Car_7086/comments/1oedn0z/builders_tea_and_how_to_make_it_properly/,Builder's Tea (And How to Make It Properly),"# After living in the UK for years and now back in the States, I'm constantly seeing Americans try to make ""strong tea"" and completely miss what makes builder's tea actually builder's tea. Here's the proper method:

**What Builder's Tea Actually Is:**

It's not just ""strong tea."" It's a specific preparation style that originated with British construction workers in the 70s-80s. The key differences from regular breakfast tea:

* **Steep time:** 4-6 minutes minimum (not the wimpy 2-3 minutes)
* **Tea amount:** 2 bags or a heaping spoon of loose leaf for one mug
* **Milk:** Generous. Like, ""that's too much milk"" level of milk
* **Sugar:** Traditional is 2+ teaspoons (though you can skip this)
* **Temperature:** Piping hot. Water must be at full boil

**The Biggest Mistakes I See:**

1. Using English Breakfast instead of Scottish/Irish breakfast (Scottish is naturally stronger with more Assam)
2. Steeping for only 2-3 minutes (you're making afternoon tea, not builder's tea)
3. Adding a ""splash"" of milk (no, you need a proper glug)
4. Using fancy teas with bergamot or florals (defeats the entire purpose)

**Looking for Proper Tea:**

The hardest part in the US is finding the right tea. Most ""English Breakfast"" here is too light. You specifically want Scottish or Irish breakfast blends with high Assam content. I finally found a US supplier that imports authentic Scottish teas (Brodies, Edinburgh Tea & Coffee Co.) and the difference is night and day.

If anyone's interested, I wrote up a [full guide with all the details here](https://naturallyscotland.com/what-is-builders-tea/) including which specific teas work best and a troubleshooting section for common problems (bitter tea, weak tea, curdled milk, etc.).

**TL;DR:** Builder's tea = Scottish/Irish breakfast blend + 5-6 min steep + lots of milk. It's a preparation method, not just ""strong tea.""",1,1761249964.0,u_Jumpy_Car_7086,0,1.0,False

My workplace wants to have an in office coffee service and is testing out different coffee machines that make a variety of coffee drinks (flavored lattes, hot chocolate, etc.) I brought up as a joke that the company should just buy an espresso machine and make me barista. 

It's not much of a joke now and I've been asked to budget out the things needed so we can compare it to other options. 

I am used to using cafe machines with two group heads with the intention of pumping out thousands of drinks a day. I will not be needing that much power. 

I am thinking 1 group head will be enough. I've been looking at the Breville brand. Seems nice but I think I want to pitch something a bit more sturdy. So I think the thousands would be a good working budget. 

One big selling point on some of the Brevilles is some of them have a grinder on the machine. I do like that but its not a requirement. ",1,1761249948.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

That‚Äôs about 6.2 miles. Not a long race but not a short one either. I‚Äôm making good progress and tinkering with what works for me on longer runs, how I can keep my body moving at an easy, consistent pace for about 70-80 minutes. I‚Äôve been increasing the distance over the past few months, prioritizing getting the distance down before I work on pace.

I train early mornings at a local high school track within walking distance of my house. They have public hours almost every morning from 6-8 am. It‚Äôs a very nice track with good lighting and ‚ú®no public bathrooms‚ú®. Because I‚Äôve been focused on increasing distance I‚Äôm waking up earlier and earlier to get to the track and really hammer it out before I go home and shower for work. In turn, I‚Äôve been drinking a little extra COFFEE most mornings get my body going. 

Til now this hasn‚Äôt been a problem, I don‚Äôt leave the house until my body takes care of business. I successfully dropped the kids off at the pool THREE TIMES before bouncing down to the track this morning. ONE LAP in and my guts are writhing. Cool cool cool. Half a lap more and I feel like I must have licked a Taco Bell toilet seat, I know I‚Äôm not gonna make it back home, it‚Äôs way too early in the am to seek relief at a coffee shop nearby, I‚Äôm a goner. Fortunately it‚Äôs still dark and there‚Äôs only four or five other runners. I slink into some of the (beautifully manicured) bushes by the track and wait for the runners to lap me, then I rip down my shorts and a stream of hot diarrhea shoots from my backside AND DOES NOT STOP for a full 15 seconds. I grab fistfuls of LEAVES like a caveman off a nearby bush to wipe myself and manage to jerk my shorts back up before the runners lap me again.

I am immediately feeling much better. I‚Äôm thinking to myself ‚Äúact normal, act normal‚Äù and resume jogging perkily, like I didn‚Äôt just evacuate my entire colon under a poor tree. Everyone keeps jogging, I‚Äôm so paranoid and embarrassed that I don‚Äôt stop jogging out of fear someone will approach me about my Crimes the minute I take my earbuds out and I accidentally PR my 5k just trying to seem inconspicuous. FOUR MILES LATER, all the other joggers finally leave I calmly, discreetly remove my T-shirt and dive into the same bush, using my FAVORITE RUNNING TEE to scoop up the massive pile of excrement so the poor groundskeepers don‚Äôt have to deal with my Sins. I dump the tee shirt in a garbage can on my way out and skulk home with a new PR and a new life lesson: carry some Wet Ones on long runs. 

TLDR: my morning coffee hit me unexpectedly at the beginning of a long run and I had to relieve myself in a nearby bush, afterward I was so anxious and humiliated I PR‚Äôed my 5k ",0,1761249942.0,tifu,0,0.5,False

Basically I confessed to my friend of 2 years a few days ago. I've had feelings for her for around 3 to 4 ish months and just really wanted to tell her especially because we don't see each other often. She rejected me but in genuinly the kindest way and she still wants to be friends but it really hurts. We spent the day together and it was so enjoyable and I had so much fun. We got coffee and donuts and the whole time I just thought that I wanted it to be like this forever which sounds cringy but it was so so much fun. I don't want to come to terms with the idea that she rejected me and I get that it's an overreaction considering how nice she has been about it but I actually don't think I'll ever meet another girl ever. I'm an apprentice student so I am seperate from everyone at uni and because I work 9 to 5 when I'm not at uni I never meet anyone ever. I truly think I am going to be alone for the rest of my life and I don't want to think about that because it's so scary. And I worry I'll never actually get over her. I don't want to just cut contact with her either becuase she truly is an amazing friend and cuttung her off just because she deosn't reciprocate would feel so shallow. I truly truly hate this situation which is also stupid bc it could've ended SO much worse for me but I still feel like crying thinking about it even though I was so lucky she responded well. I just feel so hollow and she made me feel so warm and safe but I know that I will never call her mine or be able to tell her I love her or anything like that becuase at the end of the day I can't just force my feelings onto her. That would just be selfish. I've never felt like this and seriously don't know what to do. I just feel so hopeless and devoid of energy.

I actually don't know what to do with myself and I avoid thinking about it becuase I've never known how to actually deal with things. I just kinda ignore it and after a while I forget about it and I'm trying to do the samr but it isnt working I just find myself circling back to the same thoughts of how I've fucked up. Im only a first year uni student yet I feel like I've lost all hope in myself. Anyone got any advice for me?

About a week ago I started having mild burning after peeing and cramping in my bladder/pelvis area. I went to urgent care and was prescribed Macrobid. After just one dose, all of my bladder pain completely disappeared, but I had to stop after three doses because I developed neuropathy.

Then I was switched to Bactrim, and all of my pain came back. Now I have a little bit of burning at the end of urination but mainly severe bladder/pelvic pain ‚Äî dull, aching, sometimes burning. It‚Äôs so bad I can barely sleep.

I‚Äôve had three urine tests from different places. All showed 25 leukocytes, 0 nitrates, and ‚Äúnot enough bacteria to culture.‚Äù My urologist said there was a tiny negligible trace of blood, probably from irritation. She thinks this might be cystitis or an IC flare, not an infection, and mentioned that Macrobid might‚Äôve helped because of its mild anti-inflammatory effects.

I barely drink water (maybe 1‚Äì2 cups a day) and drink a lot of sparkling water and iced coffee, so I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs making things worse. I am trying to drink water more and quitting coffee, soda, etc. 

I have had UTIs in the past and they are always extremely painful. I am not experiencing any urgency, bladder fullness, or severe burning while urinating. Mostly just severe pelvic pain. 

I‚Äôm on day 7 of the pelvic pain, and it‚Äôs not improving. My urologist ordered a PCR urine test to rule out hidden bacteria, but I‚Äôm scared it could still be a UTI that spreads if untreated.

How do you tell the difference between an IC flare and a low-level infection? And what helps calm the pain? Lastly, is there any small chance I could have a UTI that isn't showing up in the urinalysis? They can't do a full culture because the bacteria isn't growing. 

Any advice or experiences would mean a lot. I‚Äôm in a ton of pain and really confused. Thank you so much!

We were in marching band together. I was the principal flute player and he was the principal saxophone player. We knew each other as band friends for a couple years until he graduated in 2024. We have a one year, two month age gap.

A thought crossed my mind that I should reconnect with some upperclassmen this year (I‚Äôm a senior in high school and he‚Äôs in college). So I asked him to go to coffee with me.

We hit it off immediately. My parents made fun of me thinking it was a date but I assured them it wasn‚Äôt. But we would talk for hours and hours about our life goals, values, and beliefs and philosophy as we walked along the river.

One day he asked me to come down to our community docs during this summer he was home. And so we watched the sunset together. And the next day I asked him if he liked me and we confessed to each other.

We got together on the 4th of July, and we‚Äôve only been getting closer and closer.

He‚Äôs met all of my family including my grandparents and they love him. My dad even  told me he wishes the absolute best for us as a couple. And same with his parents, I will bring them baked goods and go to coffee with his mom, etc.

He treats me so well, always considers my feelings, goes above and beyond. And not just in the beginning of our relationship.

We both laughed, we cried, and we held each other the night before he had to go back to school. And we promised each other we would make it work.

Long distance is hard. But it made me realize something, he is so so worth it. We are worth it. And distance means nothing to me as long as we are together.

Recently he‚Äôs been talking about a ‚Äòvery special suprise‚Äô he has for me this winter break when he is home. And is being very vague and secretive. I asked him if it‚Äôs a ‚Äútell my family kind of suprise‚Äù and he told me my whole family will know then stuttered and said I could tell my family about his coming suprise. And he said I‚Äôll find out this winter and I‚Äôll really really love it.

I knew from that very night at the end of the summer that I wanted to marry him.

And honestly, I know we are young and I don‚Äôt care about others judgments, only the opinions of each other. But if he wants to marry me too. Im going to say yes.

Even if it‚Äôs just a promise ring i still want to marry him someday

If it‚Äôs just a simple gift I still want to marry him someday.

Today morning we went out to get breakfast together so she told my brother to stay inside the restaurant while she and i go back in the car so once its done he can get the order. the whole entire time we were waiting she kept showing pity and saying things like ""oh my poor baby how you must be tired waiting for all this time"", which, by the way, is totally okay to say to your kid. but dont get me wrong. he was sitting on a comfortable chair and a table with a perfectly working AC inside and he was just sitting on his phone so theres no difference between him and us waiting. we're both waiting, sitting, under a good AC, on our phones. so hes not really doing anything thats requiring her to assume that hes tired. 

to emphasize it again, she kept repeating those words or similar to those THE WHOLE TIME. while pouting and praying for him and saying things along the lines of how shes a burden for letting him do this ""hard"" work. 

now look, im sure im overreacting since this is normal behaviour for mother and son. but what i hate is that if the roels were reversed and it was me then she wouldnt give two shits about it. she wouldnt say half of what she said about him.

What also bothers me is that its not like hes better than me. im the one that studies all the time, independent, disciplined, i make my own food, i wake up early and on my own, i do my skincare, im consistent with my workouts and my prayers, i read, my room is always clean, i shower everyday. i ALWAYS try to get closer to her but its obvious that she doesnt care. i always ask her about her day, what shes up to, if she wants to go out on a walk, go shopping, grab coffee. she never agrees and never replies anyway. 

my brother on the other hand. needs someone to wake him up to school (he takes SO long to wake up), he sleeps late, showers once per week, brushes his teeth once per week (when he showers), needs someone to make him his food or else he wont eat anything, spends time playing games or watching shows/movies. 

i dont get why i get treated this way. i love my mom and shes done alot of great things for me, but i just kind of wish she spent more time with me instead of just treating me with money. ",5,1761249564.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False
1oedf4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1oedf4a/bf_accused_me_of_dishonesty_infidelity/,"Bf accused me of dishonesty (infidelity, indirectly)--it was totally unfounded, and now I'm considering ending it","Background: My (29F, American) boyfriend, ""J"" (39M, Puerto Rican), and I met 5 months ago and have recently relocated to a new state. We live together, have exchanged ""I love yous"" within the last month.

I have diagnosed ADHD with BIG hyperactivity and am not fond of Adderall, though I have it as an emergency option if I can't get my zoomies out. I prefer to exercise to manage my symptoms and I get incredibly irritated, short, and wound tight if I go too long without running/hiking/biking for at least 2 hours. For example, I've run several marathons and was more than 3/4 done with an ironman training plan before relocating and meeting J. When I say I have energy, I mean that I have ENERGY, and it is very high maintenance. This is relevant for later information, and is something that I have been very communicative with J about, and something that he has even been supportive about (""Have you run lately? Do you need to run today?"" etc.).

We spend nearly every moment together due to us working in the same location AND living together. We work very similar hours, with mine being 12-8p and his being 2-10p, so the vast majority of our lives are spent together. Up until recently, I was okay with this.

Issue: I planned to spend my first day of my weekend hiking in the morning, and I communicated this with J. I told him, ver batim: "" I really need to hike tomorrow. I want to be on the trail by 7AM and should be back by 10AM."" We had plans to rent bikes and ride them afterwards, which I accounted for when selecting my hike to ensure that I still had biking/adventuring energy left over.

J showed no issue with this and said ""Do what you gotta do, baby.""

In hindsight, I'm wondering if that was the first sign that he was not okay with this plan, but I--eager to get my energy out--was blind to that fact.

Come the day of, I did exactly as planned. Got up around 6:30a, left the bedroom to get coffee/fill my water, hiked from 6:50ish-9:15AM, ultimately arriving back at our home well before my projected time. I walked in, was in a great mood, greeted him with ""Good morning!"" and promptly asked him how he was doing.

Right out the gate, I was met with a very transparently malicious, ""You were 'hiking' since 6:30?""

I told him yes, I was hiking.

He began soft-launching cheating accusations, saying things like ""Who hikes for 2 hours?"" to illustrate that he clearly doubted my account. He also said, which has stuck with me: ""There are a lot of things to be done."" I told him it's 9:30AM and there is plenty of time to ""get things done"" (whatever that meant), but he responded that ""That's not what I meant.""

I still don't know what he meant by ""there are a lot of things to be done."" This makes me think that he was just saying that to try and suggest I was wasting my time in hiking, which makes me even MORE mad, as he knows that I literally cannot function until I work VERY HARD to get my energy levels to a manageable state. I am so, so communicative about this, and up until this moment, he was so, so understanding.

For your information, reddit: the hike I did was >7 miles (\~11.3 km for my non-American friends) and has an estimated completion time of 2-2.5 hours (AllTrails). I have GPS proof that I did this hike when I said I did (Garmin). I have not shown the latter information (Garmin GPS tracking) to J, as I'm not yet certain about whether his concerns are rooted in past trauma (which I understand) or if this is some weirdly controlling situation. If it's the latter, I'm especially hesitant to lean into ""here's my proof"" behavior, as I do not want this to become a regular thing. (Maybe my logic is off here. If so, please please please let me know).

At first, I tried to brush his clearly angry mood off by responding with basic affirmations, yes, I was hiking, and then I asked what he wanted to do for our day off, as we'd planned to rent bikes, go to town, etc. after my hike.

""I don't know.""

I asked if he wanted to rent bikes. ""No."" I asked if he wanted to go cash his check so he could use the money for whatever fun things he wanted. ""No."" Every pitch I had was met with a very angry, very frustrated, ""No,"" which started to grind on me. I asked him what was wrong. He told me that I'd been acting funny and that he didn't think I was hiking when I said I was. I reminded him that I told him the day before that this was the plan, that he signed off on it, and that I didn't understand what was happening or what I did wrong.

Eventually I asked him why he was so set on me being untrustworthy. He informed me that I ""lock my phone"" when he's around (he has my passcode) and that I ""turn my phone face down while I'm around him."" As a response--and this is where I definitely escalated things out of frustration--I unlocked my phone and tossed it onto the bed where he was sitting, telling him that he could look at anything he wanted. I asked him what other ""suspicious"" activity I'd been getting up to, at which point he stated that because I threw my phone at him, he was done with the conversation.

I literally spend 90% of my time in the same room as this man. I am a notoriously, painfully platonic person--to the point that he even acknowledged that it was hard for him to read that I'm into him, as I gave him little to no signs. I am fiercely independent--he knows this--and I've barely even spoken to anyone outside of OUR coworkers (because we work in the same place). This genuinely came out of nowhere and he provided zero true reason to be doubting me, aside from whatever past baggage he was bringing to the table.

When I realized that this conversation was going to go nowhere, I said ""I am going to go out. Let me know what I can do that won't piss you off, ideally bullet points so I can understand it clearly."" (This was so immature, I know. I was so mad that my otherwise-fantastic morning was so abruptly hijacked). I went for a drive, realized that my absence was probably giving him ammunition of ""I didn't know where you were, you were probably cheating."" (or whatever), so I came back.

In light of these accusations/clear illustration of lacking trust on his end, I began considering what I could do that would help him feel more secure. I kept coming up dry. I was already spending nearly all of my time with him, was already very affectionate, our sex life was reawakening after the move (new locations are hard for me and I was out of the groove for the first week, but we were back up to daily (sometimes 2-3x daily) sex), and I did exactly what I said I would do with the hike. This wasn't the first hike I'd gone on while in this relationship and anyone who knows me knows that nature is my church and I take natural time very, very seriously. This is a key tenant of my person, and it's one that J, without a doubt, knows about.

Later that day J came back into the room and started snuggling with me, kissing on me, and tried to initiate sex, but I--still in my own head about wtf I was doing that could possibly make him think I was up to some shennanigans--was not in the mood and told him as much. He got immediately annoyed, saying ""I felt bad for ruining your day so I came back, tried to love on you, tried to kiss you, I wanted to ask if you want to go for a bike ride.""

I saw red. No apology from him, no discussion, nothing. He just came in after accusing me of \[insert whatever accusation he was trying to make here\] without any true evidence (which I know for a fact because, you guessed it, I'm very boring and am definitely not doing anything suspicious), and expected me to want to have sex with him. So I told him as much: ""You've got me f\*d up if you think you can ruin my hard-earned great mood with some BS accusation of WHATEVER, and then come try and f\*ck me as if nothing happened.""

""I didn't want to start a fight, I just wanted to love on you.""

I told him that the last thing I want is to have sex with someone that obviously doesn't trust me.

""Well when you say that you're going to come back at a time and then you don't, it's going to make me suspicious.""

My eyebrows went into my hairline. I said, ver batim: ""I told you that I would be back by 10a. I was back by 9:15a. So you can f right off with that s\*\*t."" (I'm not proud of this and should have handled it differently, but I was VERY heated that he was clearly, obviously, very transparently grasping at straws, trying to find a reason to make me the bad guy, here). He didn't respond to that, only shifted focus.

This devolved into him eventually leaving, now in a terrible mood, to hang out with his friend. He took my keys in the process.

When I needed my keys later because I got locked out, I tried to call him but his phone was off/he didn't have service. I tried to get a hold of him for over an hour, waiting for him to respond to avoid any further accusations that might result from me having a maintenance man come and let me into the room. After getting zero response from him, I went to find a maintenance man to let me in. Eventually I found J, probably 3/4 of a bottle of Bacardi deep, and asked him for my keys. He, drunk, fumbled with his keychain, then my keychain, then finally handed my keys to me. I grabbed them with some speed, as I was annoyed that a) he'd previously met me with a baseless accusation (I was not over this), b) made things up to try and paint me as ""the bad guy"" (I was not over this, either), c) left me without keys to our room, d) left me without any way to contact him about the fact that I couldn't get into our room, and e) he was drinking (this has been an issue, as he is emotionally and logically unreachable when he drinks, and he has a tendency to demonize everything, pick fights, etc. when drinking).

When I grabbed the keys, his friend had to hold J back from WHATEVER \[clearly angry\] response he was going to have. I went back to the room and finally calmed down, thought through my options and what my understanding of this problem was, and I turned on some TV.

Eventually J came home with 2 bottles of Bacardi, one nearly empty, and started slamming things around, cussing under his breath.

J, drunk, cannot be reasoned with. We've had at least 2 incidents in the past with his drinking that has been characterized by him saying really awful things to me, which he has no recollection of the next day. He'd basically stopped drinking (per my request) up until this day.

Throughout the night (the night in question), J:

* Threw a to-go box of chicken and chips into my closet because I was leaving to get ice, as he clearly needed water and preferred it with ice. So I left to get ice, which I was very communicative about. He was mad I left.
* Failed to recognize me, telling me that ""[u/Odd-Explanation-2108](https://www.reddit.com/user/Odd-Explanation-2108/)¬†likes blueberries, not chocolate. At least get that right, you dumb fuck"" after he asked me to prove that I'm myself by responding to ""Pancakes?"" (I have no clue.) (I was called a ""dumb fuck"" more times than I could even count)
* Told me that if I left to take a shower (needed, because I needed to sob and knew that if he saw me, it would be this whole thing) that I ""shouldn't expect fidelity from him""
* Seemed to have conversations with someone that wasn't there? Like whole conversations.

I woke up this morning and immediately started applying for jobs elsewhere, as I'm not sure where to go from here. I do love him--the beginning of our friendship-turned-relationship was really great, but I'm not sure how to get past this. I don't like being demonized by the people I'm dating--which seems to be a huge issue here--but I also think I handled the situation with less tact than it needed, and I'm not sure if it would be worth having another conversation about this. He texted me today asking me where I am, and I told him ""I'm at \[location.\] I need space. But that's where I am.""

I also feel that it's been FAR too short of a time (5 months?) for this level of upset to be a thing in our relationship. I am worried that this indicates foundational problems, but I'm in love and am having a hard time seeing clearly.

I'm doubting my own judgment and am asking reddit for advice here (a clear sign of desperation). I don't know how to proceed, and don't know whether I'm overreacting for wanting to end things here altogether.

When he pushed me, he started asking irrelevant questions. At first, I was confused, and when his body got very close to mine, I felt pressure. At that moment, due to intense anxiety, my vision blurred, I froze, and I avoided looking at him. Eventually, he asked me, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have anything else, right?‚Äù and weakly and confused, I said, ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù and he quickly ran away.

After that, I felt a burning sensation in my body, and I don‚Äôt know if it was just stress or something worse.

A few months later, he came back. He denied being there that night and even accused me of imagining things due to stress from studying or taking drugs. But again, he grabbed my arm, tried to get close to me, and suggested that we sit and have coffee together.

8. Halloween Town House: spooky candy store
9. Blooming Flower Shop: flower shop (storage for flowers)
10. Coffee Shop House: cafe
11. Halloween Town Hall House: spooky town hall and lodging

I am currently waiting for a Mulan style house skin to make a spice shop for storage for my spices. Which house skin would be best for this idea?

The ideas I have so far;
Nightmare Castle: A witch‚Äôs den??

Haunted Before Christmas Mansion: Pumpkin/present factory?? honestly idk

Haunted Mansion: museum?? idk

La Bouff Mansion: regular hotel since I have a sort of spooky lodging already?

Masquerade Gothic Manor: A vampire‚Äôs lair? Since I have a cemetery build and a sort of wolf-bane‚Äôs garden outside

And I also need an idea for the backroom of my indoor mall, should I do more of a regular family restaurant or have a neon style restaurant. I might wait for the V8 house skin for a neon restaurant to put in EI but it would fit quite nice with the salon and kids play are tbh. Thanks!

TL;DR    Are there any safe areas to be inside near the Arch that would let me wait a few hours until my bus is in town? maybe like a hotel lobby or an all night cafe or something. please? 


Full story:

Hey STL, i‚Äôm a m(21) and it‚Äôs my first time being on a ‚Äútrip‚Äù this far from home by myself. i mainly went to see the arch and try a coffee place, but due to weird greyhound bus schedules, i‚Äôm spending the entire day here (9am-11:30pm). 

I was really loving the city and the independent feeling from traveling without someone, but i didn‚Äôt realize how scary it could be. 

I made it to a certain library; i wanted to read to pass time until closer to my return trip. when i was going down the stairs, a guy said ‚Äúwhatsup‚Äù to me, so i said ‚Äúhey how are you?‚Äù
he then started choking his girlfriend because she looked at him weird saying ‚Äúwatchu looking at me like that for?‚Äù

i immediately went to tell a librarian, because i‚Äôm strongly against DV, and i‚Äôm hoping they did something. 

anyways, i make it to the bathroom after finding a book and there‚Äôs a guy standing outside my stall waiting for me to get done‚Ä¶
he says ‚Äúyou okay in there?‚Äù
i pause, not knowing he was talking to me, and quietly whisper ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù
he repeats himself, and i respond ‚Äúyeah i‚Äôm alright, thank you?‚Äù

he leaves the bathroom and i‚Äôm finishing up, he comes back in and sits in the stall next to me, then types out on snapchat ‚Äúwant company?‚Äù and shows me his phone. 

i was confused at first then immediately said ‚Äúno thank you i‚Äôm sorry‚Äù. he ripped the stall door open then slammed it shut and stomped out of the bathroom whilst cussing (idk if it was at me or at the situation?

IM IN A PUBLIC LIBRARY? 
i‚Äôm straight, however i‚Äôll never judge who people like or love. But,  he saw that i was 20+ years younger than him and continued to press the situation. 

this certain library closes in a few hours and i‚Äôll still have 3 hours to waste until my bus gets here. i‚Äôm scared and i know i sound like a bitch but does anyone know a safe area that would let me hangout inside? i need an area close to the arch and decently populated if possible. please, i should‚Äôve listened to my mom and waited to go with her. i know i‚Äôm overreacting but I‚Äôm scared to go outside at night. 

i‚Äôm thinking maybe:
* a hotel lobby? if they don‚Äôt kick me out for loitering 
* a 24/7 cafe or restaurant?
* a bar with a good vibe? (i don‚Äôt plan on drinking tonight, just to be safe)

**She was sitting in the corner, pressed against the window, her eyes closed. I moved closer. ""Ka≈õka?"" I asked. She opened her eyes. ""Go≈õka, is that you? We haven't seen each other in so many years. How are you doing?"" ""Nothing interesting. The same thing as always‚Äîyour husband, your son. And what about you?"" She glanced out the window. ""Oh! I have to get out now, but we absolutely must meet."" ""Okay, but when?"" ""Next Saturday, at my place. Here's my business card."" She pressed a rectangular piece of paper into my hand, and it was gone. I was walking to the meeting with immense trepidation. I had been married for eight years, and she was a lawyer. We were the same age, yet I looked at least five years older than her. I knocked on the door. Ka≈õka, elegantly dressed as always, opened the door. ""Finally! I thought you'd never come."" ""I couldn't miss such an opportunity,"" I replied. We sat down in the cozy living room. Aromatic coffee, cookies, and good wine arrived on the table. At first, the conversation was slow. We hadn't seen each other for too long, there was too much to talk about, and it was hard to know where to begin. ""Tell me, what have you been doing all these years?"" I asked. ""I studied, then I did my apprenticeship, then I continued my studies, and I am who I am now."" She continued telling me about the years she spent studying legal codes, about being a successful lawyer, about the interesting cases she'd handled. Then I told her about her marriage, her son, and the house we'd built over the years. ""What about the men in your life? Do you have anyone?"" I asked, emboldened after a few glasses. ""Men are scoundrels. Whichever one I ended up with, I was immediately used to cooking, cleaning, and washing their socks, and I didn't get any pleasure from them. Let's change the subject; men aren't my favorite part of life. It was getting late, and we couldn't get enough of each other's words. ""You know what, let's move to the bedroom and talk some more,"" Ka≈õka suggested. I called my husband and announced I wouldn't be back that night. We lay down in bed together and started reminiscing about our class‚Äîwho succeeded, who didn't, who left, who stayed. I got very tired. Ka≈õka too. We turned out the light, each of us turned onto our side. I couldn't fall asleep from the overload of emotions. At first, I felt Ka≈õka's hand, first on my shoulder, then on my breast. At first, I wanted to push her away, but curiosity about what would happen next prevented me. I felt Ka≈õka's breath on my neck, sending shivers down my spine. My friend gently massaged my breast until my nipple became hard and erect. The moisture in my lower abdomen began to grow. My thoughts churned stubbornly. I slowly rolled onto my back. Ka≈õka seemed to be waiting for this, because she first began kissing me gently, then harder and harder, until finally she stuck her tongue almost down my throat. I don't know what happened to me, but I began to respond to her kiss with equal passion. As she kissed me, she began to untie the bows on my nightgown ‚Äì she was already naked herself. She stopped kissing my mouth and moved on to my breasts, kissing first one, then the other, carefully avoiding my nipples. She did it so wonderfully that I felt a veritable geyser between my legs. I lost control, pushing all thoughts away. We sat facing each other and began looking at each other, stroking each other. I held her shapely breasts, tipped with pink buds, in my hands. I touched my fingers to her lips, caressed her stomach. She did the same to me. ""Lie down, and I'll do it to you like no man has ever done to you,"" she whispered. I lay on my back, legs slightly spread. Ka≈õka sat on my stomach. She started playing with my breasts with her fingers. She kneaded them in a very specific way. She lay on top of me and began kissing me passionately ‚Äì beautifully. She moved her mouth down to my tits. She began sucking, biting, and licking them. She got me so worked up that I started begging her to touch my slit with her hand. My prayers were answered. She began massaging my slit with her nimble fingers, first gently, then with increasing intensity. She inserted one finger into my hole, then two, and began moving them around. This brought me an instant orgasm. I thrashed on the bed, howling, digging my nails into the sheets. It felt wonderful. ""It's not over yet,"" she whispered. She withdrew her fingers from my pussy and replaced them with something hard and round. After a moment, I heard a soft buzzing sound. ""He's my only man, and he's never let me down,"" Ka≈õka replied. ""Now you show me what you can do."" She lay on her stomach. At first, I didn't know what to do ‚Äì I had a vibrator in my pussy. I started licking her back, kissing her, going lower and lower. I couldn't concentrate because I felt my orgasm approaching. I howled again, but this time more quietly. Three spasms racked my body, and along with the vibrator, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãjuices poured from my pussy. Ka≈õka was still lying on her stomach, waiting for me to rest and then get back to work.**

Started noticing the guys I would normally spend time with - my uni friends, football team I play for - were becoming less and less available and left me feeling like I needed some male connection from time to time.

I set up a men's community called Shoulder to Shoulder with a pal called Dan (28) and it's grown to about 360 awesome guys.

We meet every other Sunday in Hyde Park for a walk and a coffee, sharing things we're finding challenging or stuff we've learnt which others might benefit from. Our next meet up is this Sunday at 11am in Hyde Park. 

Have found Reddit to be an awesome place to connect with other guys - you can find a bit more about our values on our website below :) all welcome!

1oed9ca,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1oed9ca/very_confusing_gi_situation_please_help_me_solve/,"Very confusing GI situation, please help me solve this puzzle.","I made another post about this recently, but I figured I‚Äôd lay it out in detail in case anyone went through something similar and found a solution. 

30 y/o male
Fairly healthy and active lifestyle 

Long story short, had a GERD-like GI issue from June 2021 to about August 2022, which returned in the beginning of this month in the middle of a viral illness. First time around, it was constant burping, very uncomfortable indigestion feelings that would feel totally random and not associated with particular triggers, occasional actual heartburn but rare. Over the course of my symptoms, I went from 215lb to 155lb. I was never totally symptom free that entire time. Now, this second time, it‚Äôs mostly excessive burping with throat burning and random weird dyspepsia sensations. I would say it‚Äôs for sure not as bad as the first episode but very bothersome.

Background to the first flair up: Started on PPIs as soon as it started, Got my first endoscopy on 9/1/21:

(9/1/2021) Pathologic Diagnosis
A. Duodenum biopsy:
-Small intestine mucosa with preserved villous architecture
-No increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes, granulomata or glandular dysplasia are identified on examined sections
B. Gastric antrum biopsy:
-Gastric antral mucosa with mild chronic inflammation, lamina propria fibrosis and reactive glandular changes, consistent with reactive antral gastropathy
-Gastric body mucosa without significant histopathology changes -Immunohistochemical stain for H. pylori organism is negative C. Gastroesophageal junction biopsy:
-Gastroesophageal junctional mucosa with mild inflammation and reactive glandular and squamous changes, negative for intestinal metaplasia
-no glandular dysplasia 

Basically negative for erosion or signs of GERD, is how my first and second GI both interpreted that. Although there was some sort of very mild irritation or chemical reactivity in the stomach and esophageal junction area that was too vague to be associated with any one thing. 

From August through October I was strict GERD diet anyway. Stayed on PPIs (tried multiple), and no onions, garlic, tomatoes spicy, citrus, greasy, mint, overly sugary, etc. I cut down coffee and alcohol drastically, and there was a period of 3 weeks where I didn‚Äôt have any alcohol at all, and a month where I had no coffee at all. After that, maybe because none of that worked, I became a tiny bit less strict around foods that didn‚Äôt make me feel gross when I ate them. Because my symptoms were pretty much constant and only change in severity, it was hard to tell if particular foods made things any worse or better or if they were even triggers. In the late fall-mid winter the gross indigestion feeling was almost totally replaced by throat mucus and throat clearing, but the indigestion came back for a bit in the spring. Over this time, I tried raw aloe, d-limonene, slippery elm supplements, probiotics, an inconclusive allergy panel, and the antibiotics for potential SIBO (which just made things worse for a week or two). I was also extremely anxious about my symptoms for large portions of the time I had then. It got better with time but I was definitely distressed. 

GI specialist advised me to get off PPIs in December because they weren‚Äôt doing anything, so I did, then re-tried them for a bit in late spring/early summer.

Eventually, I got a second endoscopy and a pH test. 

(6/27/2022) Pathologic Diagnosis
Stomach, biopsy:
 -Diffuse mildly erythematous mucosa without bleeding in the gastric antrum, but histologically normal gastric antral type mucosa 
-Immunostain for H. pylori is negative for organisms  
-normal esophagus
-pH test showed normal levels for reflux.

So, again, everything pretty much normal, but it looked like the esophageal junction area had maybe healed a little since September (even though I never had corrosion, just mild reactivity, which was now gone)? It‚Äôs hard to remember the severity of my symptoms at the time, but I remember they were still there and bothersome enough for me to get a second endoscopy, so after that point I basically just gave up. I was prescribed amitryptaline somewhere around that time, but that was the last intervention. I decided to say fuck it and live my life and just accept whatever symptoms I had. I know I was on amitryptaline until at least September 2022.

Then, within a few months of that second scope, I realized my issues weren‚Äôt really bothering me anymore. And that‚Äôs how it was for the next three years. I think I was always a bit more prone to a bit of bloating after all that, but I could eat whatever without thinking about it after a bit. the constant burping, gross dyspepsia/indigestion feeling, and throat symptoms stopped. And I generally was eating healthy! So it‚Äôs not like I started abusing my esophagus. 

Everything was good and my symptoms were forgotten until three weeks ago in the middle of a viral illness. Idk if it was covid or what, I didn‚Äôt test, but I was mildly sick. Towards the tail end of being sick, I hit my vape (not great to do when you‚Äôre sick, I know) and immediately the gassy burpy feeling came back. Within a couple of days I got on PPIs again. Within a week or two I gave in and realized I probably should cut some foods out to be safe. Currently, I‚Äôm not eating chocolate, spicy stuff, tomato sauce, citrus, super greasy fried stuff, cutting down coffee to maybe one cold brew a week (less acidic than normal coffee), cutting down alcohol as much as I can (drank some non-carbonated less acidic options at two parties in the three week span a reasonable amount, but nothing else) etc. Even though it all felt kind of futile last time.

And what‚Äôs fucked up is my symptoms seem to be getting a little worse? I developed some throat burning mid way through, and just a touch of that familiar indigestion feeling hits me occasionally. I‚Äôm on week three of PPIs. 

Chocolate, an RX bar, salami, and very processed tomato sauce immediately seemed to set off a bad reaction. Alcohol, fresh tomatoes, lightly breaded chicken, etc don‚Äôt seem like major triggers which is unusual for GERD. IDK. It‚Äôs hard to navigate because I have some sort of mild reaction when I eat or drink anything. I lost so much weight last time that I‚Äôm trying to not be super uptight with the restrictions, especially considering actual evidence of abnormal acid reflux wasn‚Äôt found. 

My next step rn is that amitryptaline was the last thing prescribed to me before it started to resolve last time, so I think it‚Äôs worth a shot. I can‚Äôt see a GI until January, but my GP is willing to prescribe it. It seems like my situation could be some type of esophageal hypersensitivity/vagus issue, and amitryptaline is well-indicated for that. 

I‚Äôm making this long ass post in hope that someone might have an idea of what‚Äôs going on here that‚Äôs better than mine. It seems like actual GERD was contra-indicated on three tests during my last bout of this, so I‚Äôm not sure what to do beyond getting to a full with PPIs anyway and then trying the amitryptaline. I figure maybe actual mild reflux events could be the root of this, but maybe my body takes a long time to fully recover because of anxiety and nerve sensitivity? Just a guess. But it really sucks because I felt like almost got ‚Äúlucky‚Äù with it going away the first time, and have no clue how this will last now. And I don‚Äôt want to lose a bunch of weight again :( any advice, insight, or positivity is appreciated. 

I also know that staying off this sub is important if you want to stay sane, so it‚Äôll be my last post for a while, lol.

I lived in Munich for two months about 1,5 years ago and I honestly can‚Äôt stop thinking about how hard it was to connect with people there. Like the city was beautiful, I loved everything about it except I just couldn‚Äôt break into any social circles

I tried different approaches. Went to startup meetups thinking maybe professional networking would lead to friendships - everyone was polite but very focused on business talk, no one actually wanted to hang out after. Tried board game meetups which were fun but people would just play and leave, no real connection. Joined a bunch of Facebook groups for expats and internationals but it felt like shouting into void

I also met 2 people from Bumble BFF. We‚Äôd have nice conversations, meet for coffee, talk for an hour or two and it would go well. But then when I‚Äôd text them later to hang out again they‚Äôd take days to respond or say they‚Äôre busy. Like they were being friendly but not actually looking for friends?

I heard someone say Germans need like 2 years to actually let you into their life and I started believing it. Everyone seemed to have their established friend groups from childhood or university and wasn‚Äôt really looking to add anyone new

I left feeling like maybe I just didn‚Äôt stay long enough or didn‚Äôt understand the culture. But 2 months felt like forever when you‚Äôre lonely

Did anyone else experience this? Or have you found a way to actually make real friends there? What worked?",0,1761248911.0,munichsocialclub,0,0.5,False

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it‚Äôs not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy.

I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

So, she decided to replace some of the furniture and buy softer pieces for the baby! She changed the sofa and got one that‚Äôs super fluffy like a loaf of bread so the baby can cuddle and lean on it safely. For the coffee table, she went with a giant pouf, and she did the same for the chaise.

For the chairs, she chose a very soft yet comfy fabric perfect for her. The only problem was the accent table. She wanted to put a lamp on it, which meant it couldn‚Äôt be soft. So, the solution was to buy a tall one the baby couldn‚Äôt reach!

She did the same with the buffet, pushing it way back against the wall,  safety first, of course! What‚Äôs missing? A rug soft like a foam puzzle mat! She decided the baby would only be allowed into the living room once that rug arrived.

The colors didn‚Äôt quite match, but that didn‚Äôt bother her. In fact, she thought it was great for the baby.  All those mismatched shades would help stimulate their senses and train their little eyes to recognize colors!

He was heavy into alcohol and drugs and I had no idea. We eventually started going through a divorce and he moved out. Post move out he finally came clean about everything and stopped drinking. I paused the divorce. It was like an entirely different man. My dreams came true. He was wonderful to be around and I could have conversations with him without being gaslit or berated for sharing how I feel. Yesterday I found whisky hidden in a coffee tumbler. He‚Äôd been drinking for 2 months behind my back. 

When I confronted him all the gaslighting started again. He said he didn‚Äôt look tell me because he knew how I would react and I need to think about if I want to be this nagging person. He brought up when we were separated how I missed credit card payments. It felt irrelevant because I shared that with him. 

For a whole year he really changed and I thought it was for good. Now I‚Äôm feeling sad and a little broken. My dream for myself and my girls are shattered all over again. The hardest part is things have been going great, and he chose to lie and sneak around again. He says he doesn‚Äôt have a problem and realized he was able to drink and be ok now and doesn‚Äôt need to share this with me because he‚Äôs a grown man. It all feels wrong.

1oed1af,https://tipstor.net/travelers-are-suddenly-ditching-suitcases-for-this-one-bag/,Travelers are Suddenly Ditching Suitcases for This One Bag,"There‚Äôs something primal about dragging your life‚Äôs possessions through an airport terminal, weaving between bleary-eyed passengers and overpriced coffee stands. But there‚Äôs also a fine line between traveling and suffering. That line is drawn by the wheels of a good duffle bag. Forget the clunky hard-shell suitcases that look like they‚Äôre auditioning for a sci-fi movie. The true wanderer, the kind who moves between countries, stories, and drinks without a plan, knows that the real travel hack isn‚Äôt a luxury carry-on or a tech gadget. It‚Äôs the humble, convenient wheeled duffle bag.

A proper wheeled duffle doesn‚Äôt just carry clothes. It carries freedom. It‚Äôs the one bag that adapts to your life‚Äôs chaos. You can toss it into the back of a tuk-tuk in Bangkok, drag it over cobblestones in Lisbon, or roll it through customs with the smug satisfaction of someone who didn‚Äôt overpack. The best models balance ruggedness with flexibility. They‚Äôre built for the traveler who values movement over appearances, who understands that the journey matters more than how neatly their clothes are folded.

The average cost for one of these beauties runs around USD 120 to USD 180 on Amazon. That‚Äôs a small price for what might be the last piece of luggage you ever buy willingly. The duffle‚Äôs wheels are smooth, the handles collapse with precision, and the material, usually a mix of ballistic nylon or high-denier polyester, can take a beating. If your trip turns rough, it can even double as a makeshift seat, footrest, or barricade against questionable hostel roommates.

The genius of the wheeled duffle lies in its ability to blur the line between organized and unhinged. It gives you just enough structure to survive an airport but enough chaos to still feel alive. You can unzip one side, stuff it with souvenirs, local snacks, or that extra bottle of mezcal you swore you wouldn‚Äôt buy, and roll onward like a traveler who‚Äôs cracked the code.

This, right here, is the best travel hack. It‚Äôs not glamorous. It doesn‚Äôt plug in. But it makes life on the road a smoother, saner ride. Forget the sleek marketing of ‚Äúsmart luggage.‚Äù Real travelers don‚Äôt need Bluetooth or built-in batteries. They need a bag that rolls when life refuses to. A good wheeled duffle doesn‚Äôt make you look rich. It makes you look like you‚Äôve been places, and that‚Äôs worth far more than the USD 150 it costs to buy one.

1oecu9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1oecu9a/coworkers_keep_turning_up_the_music_in_the_cafe/,"Coworkers keep turning up the music in the cafe, but customers are complaining","For frame of reference, with my store‚Äôs layout the cafe music speakers only play music into the cafe and don‚Äôt reach behind the line or into the back room at all. I know there‚Äôs a couple stores in our district where the music goes into every part of the store but it doesn‚Äôt at mine. 

Basically, I‚Äôve been having this debate with my coworkers for a while. When I can I check to make sure the volume knob is around 40-50% up, to where you can kinda hear it behind the line but not really, but from the cafe you can hear it perfectly clear. Recently it‚Äôs been every time that I come in the music will be blaring because they turned the knob to like 75% or louder and they say it‚Äôs because they can‚Äôt hear the music from behind the line. But once you step into the cafe, the music is loud enough that you have to raise your voice to talk over it. We‚Äôve had multiple customers complain about not being able to hear their phone calls and talk with their friends sitting in the cafe, we have 1 star google reviews over this, and we just got a ‚Äúno‚Äù response on our customer connection sheet saying that the music was too loud. 

From my perspective, we‚Äôre obviously not gonna be able to hear the music from behind the line if there‚Äôs no speakers directed back here, especially if it‚Äôs peak and people are slamming pitchers around, and the cafe is packed full. That‚Äôs just the environment being loud and we shouldn‚Äôt be turning up the music to overcompensate for it. Especially when it‚Äôs affecting customer connection, reviews, and genuinely turning people away from our store. 

I would like to not really care about this but I feel like if people are sitting in the cafe doing work or meeting friends and just spent $10 on a coffee, they might as well have a good experience while they‚Äôre here. And because my coworkers argue with me on this everyday. 

So if anyone has insights or even standards as to what the volume of the music should look like, please let me know so I can settle this!

We live together, have exchanged ""I love yous"" within the last month.

I have diagnosed ADHD with BIG hyperactivity and am not fond of Adderall, though I have it as an emergency option if I can't get my zoomies out. I prefer to exercise to manage my symptoms and I get incredibly irritated, short, and wound tight if I go too long without running/hiking/biking for at least 2 hours. For example, I've run several marathons and was more than 3/4 done with an ironman training plan before relocating and meeting J. When I say I have energy, I mean that I have ENERGY, and it is very high maintenance. This is relevant for later information, and is something that I have been very communicative with J about, and something that he has even been supportive about (""Have you run lately? Do you need to run today?"" etc.).

We spend nearly every moment together due to us working in the same location AND living together. We work very similar hours, with mine being 12-8p and his being 2-10p, so the vast majority of our lives are spent together. Up until recently, I was okay with this.

Issue: I planned to spend my first day of my weekend hiking in the morning, and I communicated this with J. I told him, ver batim: "" I really need to hike tomorrow. I want to be on the trail by 7AM and should be back by 10AM."" We had plans to rent bikes and ride them afterwards, which I accounted for when selecting my hike to ensure that I still had biking/adventuring energy left over.

J showed no issue with this and said ""Do what you gotta do, baby.""

In hindsight, I'm wondering if that was the first sign that he was not okay with this plan, but I--eager to get my energy out--was blind to that fact.

Come the day of, I did exactly as planned. Got up around 6:30a, left the bedroom to get coffee/fill my water, hiked from 6:50ish-9:15AM, ultimately arriving back at our home well before my projected time. I walked in, was in a great mood, greeted him with ""Good morning!"" and promptly asked him how he was doing.

Right out the gate, I was met with a very transparently malicious, ""You were 'hiking' since 6:30?""

I told him yes, I was hiking.

He began soft-launching cheating accusations, saying things like ""Who hikes for 2 hours?"" to illustrate that he clearly doubted my account. He also said, which has stuck with me: ""There are a lot of things to be done."" I told him it's 9:30AM and there is plenty of time to ""get things done"" (whatever that meant), but he responded that ""That's not what I meant.""

I still don't know what he meant by ""there are a lot of things to be done."" This makes me think that he was just saying that to try and suggest I was wasting my time in hiking, which makes me even MORE mad, as he knows that I literally cannot function until I work VERY HARD to get my energy levels to a manageable state. I am so, so communicative about this, and up until this moment, he was so, so understanding.

For your information, reddit: the hike I did was >7 miles (\~11.3 km for my non-American friends) and has an estimated completion time of 2-2.5 hours (AllTrails). I have GPS proof that I did this hike when I said I did (Garmin). I have not shown the latter information (Garmin GPS tracking) to J, as I'm not yet certain about whether his concerns are rooted in past trauma (which I understand) or if this is some weirdly controlling situation. If it's the latter, I'm especially hesitant to lean into ""here's my proof"" behavior, as I do not want this to become a regular thing. (Maybe my logic is off here. If so, please please please let me know).

At first, I tried to brush his clearly angry mood off by responding with basic affirmations, yes, I was hiking, and then I asked what he wanted to do for our day off, as we'd planned to rent bikes, go to town, etc. after my hike.

""I don't know.""

I asked if he wanted to rent bikes. ""No."" I asked if he wanted to go cash his check so he could use the money for whatever fun things he wanted. ""No."" Every pitch I had was met with a very angry, very frustrated, ""No,"" which started to grind on me. I asked him what was wrong. He told me that I'd been acting funny and that he didn't think I was hiking when I said I was. I reminded him that I told him the day before that this was the plan, that he signed off on it, and that I didn't understand what was happening or what I did wrong.

Eventually I asked him why he was so set on me being untrustworthy. He informed me that I ""lock my phone"" when he's around (he has my passcode) and that I ""turn my phone face down while I'm around him."" As a response--and this is where I definitely escalated things out of frustration--I unlocked my phone and tossed it onto the bed where he was sitting, telling him that he could look at anything he wanted. I asked him what other ""suspicious"" activity I'd been getting up to, at which point he stated that because I threw my phone at him, he was done with the conversation.

I literally spend 90% of my time in the same room as this man. I am a notoriously, painfully platonic person--to the point that he even acknowledged that it was hard for him to read that I'm into him, as I gave him little to no signs. I am fiercely independent--he knows this--and I've barely even spoken to anyone outside of OUR coworkers (because we work in the same place). This genuinely came out of nowhere and he provided zero true reason to be doubting me, aside from whatever past baggage he was bringing to the table.

When I realized that this conversation was going to go nowhere, I said ""I am going to go out. Let me know what I can do that won't piss you off, ideally bullet points so I can understand it clearly."" (This was so immature, I know. I was so mad that my otherwise-fantastic morning was so abruptly hijacked). I went for a drive, realized that my absence was probably giving him ammunition of ""I didn't know where you were, you were probably cheating."" (or whatever), so I came back.

In light of these accusations/clear illustration of lacking trust on his end, I began considering what I could do that would help him feel more secure. I kept coming up dry. I was already spending nearly all of my time with him, was already very affectionate, our sex life was reawakening after the move (new locations are hard for me and I was out of the groove for the first week, but we were back up to daily (sometimes 2-3x daily) sex), and I did exactly what I said I would do with the hike. This wasn't the first hike I'd gone on while in this relationship and anyone who knows me knows that nature is my church and I take natural time very, very seriously. This is a key tenant of my person, and it's one that J, without a doubt, knows about.

Later that day J came back into the room and started snuggling with me, kissing on me, and tried to initiate sex, but I--still in my own head about wtf I was doing that could possibly make him think I was up to some shennanigans--was not in the mood and told him as much. He got immediately annoyed, saying ""I felt bad for ruining your day so I came back, tried to love on you, tried to kiss you, I wanted to ask if you want to go for a bike ride.""

I saw red. No apology from him, no discussion, nothing. He just came in after accusing me of \[insert whatever accusation he was trying to make here\] without any true evidence (which I know for a fact because, you guessed it, I'm very boring and am definitely not doing anything suspicious), and expected me to want to have sex with him. So I told him as much: ""You've got me f\*d up if you think you can ruin my hard-earned great mood with some BS accusation of WHATEVER, and then come try and f\*ck me as if nothing happened.""

""I didn't want to start a fight, I just wanted to love on you.""

I told him that the last thing I want is to have sex with someone that obviously doesn't trust me.

""Well when you say that you're going to come back at a time and then you don't, it's going to make me suspicious.""

My eyebrows went into my hairline. I said, ver batim: ""I told you that I would be back by 10a. I was back by 9:15a. So you can f right off with that s\*\*t."" (I'm not proud of this and should have handled it differently, but I was VERY heated that he was clearly, obviously, very transparently grasping at straws, trying to find a reason to make me the bad guy, here). He didn't respond to that, only shifted focus.

This devolved into him eventually leaving, now in a terrible mood, to hang out with his friend. He took my keys in the process.

When I needed my keys later because I got locked out, I tried to call him but his phone was off/he didn't have service. I tried to get a hold of him for over an hour, waiting for him to respond to avoid any further accusations that might result from me having a maintenance man come and let me into the room. After getting zero response from him, I went to find a maintenance man to let me in. Eventually I found J, probably 3/4 of a bottle of Bacardi deep, and asked him for my keys. He, drunk, fumbled with his keychain, then my keychain, then finally handed my keys to me. I grabbed them with some speed, as I was annoyed that a) he'd previously met me with a baseless accusation (I was not over this), b) made things up to try and paint me as ""the bad guy"" (I was not over this, either), c) left me without keys to our room, d) left me without any way to contact him about the fact that I couldn't get into our room, and e) he was drinking (this has been an issue, as he is emotionally and logically unreachable when he drinks, and he has a tendency to demonize everything, pick fights, etc. when drinking).

When I grabbed the keys, his friend had to hold J back from WHATEVER \[clearly angry\] response he was going to have. I went back to the room and finally calmed down, thought through my options and what my understanding of this problem was, and I turned on some TV.

Eventually J came home with 2 bottles of Bacardi, one nearly empty, and started slamming things around, cussing under his breath.

J, drunk, cannot be reasoned with. We've had at least 2 incidents in the past with his drinking that has been characterized by him saying really awful things to me, which he has no recollection of the next day. He'd basically stopped drinking (per my request) up until this day.

Throughout the night (the night in question), J:

* Threw a to-go box of chicken and chips into my closet because I was leaving to get ice, as he clearly needed water and preferred it with ice. So I left to get ice, which I was very communicative about. He was mad I left.
* Failed to recognize me, telling me that ""u/Odd-Explanation-2108 likes blueberries, not chocolate. At least get that right, you dumb fuck"" after he asked me to prove that I'm myself by responding to ""Pancakes?"" (I have no clue.) (I was called a ""dumb fuck"" more times than I could even count)
* Told me that if I left to take a shower (needed, because I needed to sob and knew that if he saw me, it would be this whole thing) that I ""shouldn't expect fidelity from him""
* Seemed to have conversations with someone that wasn't there? Like whole conversations.

I woke up this morning and immediately started applying for jobs elsewhere, as I'm not sure where to go from here. I do love him--the beginning of our friendship-turned-relationship was really great, but I'm not sure how to get past this. I don't like being demonized by the people I'm dating--which seems to be a huge issue here--but I also think I handled the situation with less tact than it needed, and I'm not sure if it would be worth having another conversation about this. He texted me today asking me where I am, and I told him ""I'm at \[location.\] I need space. But that's where I am.""

I also feel that it's been FAR too short of a time (5 months?) for this level of upset to be a thing in our relationship. I am worried that this indicates foundational problems, but I'm in love and am having a hard time seeing clearly.

I'm doubting my own judgment and am asking reddit for advice here (a clear sign of desperation). I don't know how to proceed, and don't know whether I'm overreacting for wanting to end things here altogether.

Thank you for reading my novel and I greatly appreciate any advice you have, even if it hurts my ego.",2,1761247879.0,AmIOverreacting,6,1.0,False

I am wondering if something in my diet has been the culprit all along. I have not had any of these foods since October 1st.

1oecigh,https://www.reddit.com/r/awakened/comments/1oecigh/i_have_finally_understood_nonduality_and_the/,"I have finally understood non-duality and the people in this sub, for beginners I will explain everything they say in the easiest way possible unlike what they do, my mind was very bad at discernment and understanding from drug abuse yet I still go it!
Discussion","First please read everything, this will be the post that explains it the most easily, I will start by saying that you do not need anything or any special time to be free however just as milk that is not churned enough will not become butter so without some form of practice you would have exhausted your mind in vain in thoughts (atleast for me)

If your mind is clear without attachment or affected by emotions, you would be free this very instant (skip till the middle of the post) but otherwise you will have to walk the way, that is not a bad thing but a good thing, the more you walk slowly the faster you actually arrive, I rushed so many times yet walking one step a time is the fastest.

I am not writing this for normal people with great discerning minds but only either for beginners or people who used to abuse drugs who have numbed their mind and therefore lack discernment, I have not realised Self (whatever it means I don't know) but I am free of the ego completely.

The most effective path that worked for me was pranayama, meaning breath-control, why? because I was always in sympathetic dominance meaning in fight or flight mode in my life because of suffering, pain and people that hurt me, I was never ""calm"" so no matter how many scriptures I read or times I meditated I never got it! Why? because I did not have the nervous system that could hold it or discern the truth, I could not let the water of mind still and the barrage of thoughts stop.

In my mind that was damaged from drug abuse, I could read the words but not internalise them, I could even understand them but not feel them or use them to discern the truth even though I read countless scriptures, I just felt them to be nihilistic and they hurt me and made me despair at times, I was way too emotional and hurt and the truth was very unexpected.

What intense pranayama did to me was first my intense suffering disappeared after 2 weeks of daily 2-3h of pranayama through the nose that have long breath holds like 6-12-6-12 which is my favourite, I did intense techniques with long holds, these forced my nervous system to calm down by activating the vagus nerve that signals calmness and entering parasympathetic mode, I did these breathing techniques daily to avoid suffering, I would let suffering come and hurt me yet continue the breaths.

Another thing it did was make my nervous system stronger and able to bear more gradually, what this meant was pain was way less intense, heat and cold was way less intense, and the greatest thing EVER was emotions no longer moved me, I could keep calm and not have my heart beating all the time whatever arose me even suicidal thoughts, that does no mean I do not feel emotions like sadness but I no longer feel depression or despair at all and even the sadness even if I partake in it doesn't affect me in my depth.

Anyway practice pranayama or meditation but for me meditation is near impossible, my mind could never keep quit and not distract me by breathing in and out, I had to follow a timer of pranayama which is much easier, I also fixed my diet and went into the sun, the point is you have to make sure your body isn't disturbing because if it disturbs you it disturbs your mind.

**Anyway so you want the truth?**

**How do we become free of this world?**

**My friend, please tell when were you not free?**

**Pranayama for me absolutely cleansed everything. It was so quiet that I began to discern ""Oh I didn't actually will this movement of my hand"" ""Oh, that thought happened by itself?"" When talking to people, I could even forget myself and only remember after the talking happened.**

**I could still my mind enough to began to discern, the first epiphany came from reading ""the flight of the garuda""**¬†I read it and read it, it was so simple and clear, no complicated words, everything easy.

The gist of it is ""Just don't fabricate or fixate and notice!""

Reading these scriptures while calm changed everything, the meaning entered the depth and like a seed began to sprout.

Before reading anything about awareness would cause nihilism to manifest in me as well as pressure to the chest, I could never just be calm and read it without fear.

**After reading it, I could walk and just move the sight of my eye from place to place**¬†**and walk in silence.**

But even then, I still couldn't figure out the truth until I began to discern using the techniques flight of the garuda.

Do this : ""when a thought comes, see where it came from, see where it is when it arises, and see where it goes when it vanishes!""

Do this from a perception pov, don't do it like I did with a drug abused brain meaning do it using the ego, Rest behind the ego but you can't do this without pranayama if your mind is weak at discerning or is too emotional, what pranayama does is you can go a length of time in silence, me in normal times thoughts were so fast and there was so much pain meaning I could not just ""be"", just feeling your body was impossible for me, I never just felt my body and moved.

**Anyway, so I began to investigate, I would wait for a thought yet I found it hard to catch a thought at all like a person fishing but not catching anything, it was impossible, why? because it came from behind me like an assassin, I would become the thought without even feeling it, only after it became me did I notice ""Ah, it got me""**

After long investigation, I noticed there were two types of thoughts, thoughts that were like birds coming in flying in front of you, you can see them and they don't grab you, but some other thoughts¬†**they become you without you even noticing!**

**You are not the one fearing or suffering or hating or with any evil thought, the opposite, you are actually the joy, the love and everything good and stable however at the same time not with ego, meaning without possession.**

So anyway I investigated, with my being I searched where the thought came from, where they stayed when they existed and where they vanished and I failed completely, thoughts come from nothing and return to nothing,¬†**the breakthrough was where the thought was when it arised, at one point, I was so still that half way through a thought I detached from it and it continued on its own and in that moment, the following thoughts I focused on where they arose yet when I put my attention on them, they seemed so far away**, like looking at something in the far horizon, the thought being the horizon, I was shocked

**Later on in that same state, I tried to investigate the world without the ego, and when I did, I felt the world was so far away like we were into two different dimensions, and I felt the world wasn't solid, not that it was fluid or any of that shit, just it wasn't dividable and it had nothing in it that was seperate but you would say in my life, I see solid objects and they are different and they are solid and vivid.**

**Here is the problem with any investigation, you take the ego with you and investigate with it! I never noticed any of this until I was in the state where I felt thought was far and I was just seeing without any thought and from that base I did the investigation, what I noticed was that seperation and unity were not different, yes the objects are seperate yet that seperation doesn't negate that perception is one.**

Problem is trying to understand it with your mind and ego, in that base where thought felt far and I was discerning all the time, I felt with absolute certainty that I wasn't the actor, there was no doubt in my mind at all.

*Point is you would realise this faster if you just give up without doing the giving up, but*¬†***IF YOU ARE LIKE ME I WILL SWEAR TO YOU IT WILL NEVER WORK FOR YOU!***

Why did it work for me? am I special?

**Because I did INTENSE BREATHWORK**¬†with long holds after exhales, I handled that pressure in the body countless times for a total 180h of practice with intense ratios like 6-12-6-12 or 8-16-8-16,¬†**I always pushed myself hard on breathwork, so when it came time to be centerless, there was significant pressure but it wasn't as hard as doing 12s hold after a long exhale after 1h of doing it constantly**

**The Ego was used that that pressure in the body doesn't kill us, so there was no resistance**

**There! There was freedom for a moment before an intense fear invaded, same as that pressure, it came it manifested I expected I would be pulled back, for some unknown reason I wasn't pulled by the ego, maybe you can call it grace, I just stayed centerless, emotions invaded, fear, love, sadness, depression, some past painful memories, if not for pranayama I would have been pulled back but I was used to the pressure**

**After this I became centerless, I didn't know where I was going or who I am, I would talk to someone naturally, a second later I'd forget I even met him, I was in uni and Its been a month and I didn't study knowing I had dropped out of college and for 5 years did nothing and it was a huge trauma, I wasn't pulled, the fear came, it stayed, it faded like it never existed.**

**I remained centerless, at a point the ego PULLED ME HARD, NO REACTION, THERE WAS NO ONE TO FIGHT IT AND THUS IT VANISHED.**

Point is in this state, there was no bliss like a pleasure, there was not even peace, there was just presence that is not anyway special or different than you right now existing, it was natural, you can call it¬†**naturalness**

But what about pain or discomfort?

For now, there is non-resistance meaning things come, they stay and they depart or they stay as long as they want

The next day, I drank coffee (it just happened) and the ego re-emerged powerful, I talked with people and laughed with them,¬†**the ego was present Yet for some unknown reason whenever the ego feared even a minimal fear it didn't affect my being at all despite pressure in the chest!**

The ego would come and go as it wished, there was being with people and doing things¬†**YET it was as if nothing happened or everything happened by itself**

When there is no fixation, there is no recalling, therefore things appear, events happen, things move and then as if none of it happened.

I don't talk to people, talking happens naturally, I don't do virtue, virtue happens by itself, even when the ego is careful and avoids something it doesn't affect me¬†**because it is allowed**

**I realised the ""ego"" is just the survival mechanism of the body, it is not evil, But when Awareness identifies with the ego, the ego becomes restless, Awareness sees itself as the ego and suffering is experienced, it doesn't affect awareness but it is nonetheless experienced.**

**From my point of view now, the ego when it is not believed to be oneself is the expression of Awareness and it reflects what Awareness is in its essence, its the vehicle to express joy, love, peace without any possession of those things.**

**Even when there are thoughts like ""Oh Fuck it will fade away"" or ""There is still more to find, perhaps there is bliss elsewhere"" they are either noticed as you seeing a bird fly in front of you or an assassin coming behind to stab you except when the assassin comes to stab you, when he delivers the death blow, he finds nothing to hurt or kill**.

The way I see it now, the world is just Awareness experiencing itself through different forms and expressions.

1oecfkv,https://i.redd.it/fkuttxn0wwwf1.jpeg,Austin Motel (Bunkhouse)- Stay Overview,"I recently had a one-night stay at the Austin Motel, which is a Bunkhouse property that recently joined WOH. I typically stay in the suburbs, but the majority of my meetings were downtown on this trip, and this property was the lowest priced by over $100 a night ($208 base on a queen room). I previously lived in the Austin area for a decade, and I was excited to stay in such a unique place that I had driven and walked by countless times before. 

After an early flight, I arrived around 9 am, hoping that a room might be available. Given the size of the property and staff, I was told that they would text me ASAP.

Coming off consecutive weeks of ACL and F1, the team there had been running hard, and this was the first ""quiet"" week in some time. I received word around noon that my room was ready and that I had been upgraded to a suite.

When I checked in, the front desk greeted me and mentioned that they had just joined WOH. ""We've been so excited to have Globalists begin to stay with us!"" was such a genuinely sweet way of being welcomed, and she eagerly shared the details about the property.

The space was trendy and upbeat. It's an older property (opened in the '30s) and is full of retro charm. The pool area is small, but it feels like a time warp to a simpler time. The suite was spacious, but certainly not luxurious. Still, plenty of space to relax and work.

The breakfast benefit was a coupon to take next door to Jo's, a South Congress staple and photo-op for a long time. The benefit was for any drink and food item, which for me included a signature coffee drink and two breakfast tacos. 

Parking is free, regardless of status.

The biggest benefit of this place, aside from its charm, is its location. From here, you are a short walk away from all that South Congress has to offer- food, drinks, shopping, etc. It was a Monday evening, so the noise was low, but I imagine the location is probably on the louder side during busier nights.

All in all, it was a great spot that I will likely stay at again. Probably not the first choice for most business travelers, this would be a great place for a couple doing a getaway, a girls' weekend, etc.

1oec8zk,https://i.redd.it/4wnrr5bw1wwf1.png,The Diet-PE Link: How Stimulants and Food Sensitivities Can Affect Latency,"**Keywords:**¬†Premature Ejaculation, Diet, Sexual Health, Ejaculatory Latency, Food Sensitivity

Mark (name changed for privacy) struggled for years with premature ejaculation, impacting his confidence and relationships. He'd tried behavioral techniques, even considered medication, but always wondered: could his diet be playing a hidden role? Was that extra coffee, or perhaps a food sensitivity he didn't know about, speeding things up? This common question highlights a significant area of interest for many experiencing premature ejaculation (PE).

Premature ejaculation (PE) is a common condition where an individual ejaculates sooner than they or their partner would like, often with minimal stimulation and a feeling of lack of control. While many factors contribute to PE, from psychological elements like anxiety to biological imbalances, the role of diet is frequently pondered. It‚Äôs important to clarify upfront: current scientific evidence¬†*does not*¬†establish a direct causal link between specific dietary stimulants or diagnosed food sensitivities and PE itself. However, what you eat significantly impacts your overall health, including vital aspects of sexual function.

A healthy, balanced diet supports optimal blood flow, hormone balance, and neurotransmitter function ‚Äì all crucial for sexual health. Conversely, an unhealthy diet can indirectly worsen sexual issues. Let's look at the evidence.

# The Indirect Influence of Diet on Ejaculatory Control

While no specific food is a magic bullet for PE, certain nutrients and eating patterns can support the physiological mechanisms involved in sexual function, potentially aiding in better ejaculatory control:

* **Blood Flow and Cardiovascular Health:**¬†Foods rich in nitric oxide precursors and antioxidants can improve circulation, which is essential for arousal and sexual performance. Consider incorporating¬†**spinach**¬†(magnesium, nitric oxide),¬†**watermelon**¬†(citrulline),¬†**pomegranate juice**, and¬†**walnuts**¬†(omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants). While not a direct PE treatment, better blood flow supports overall genital health.
* **Hormonal Balance:**¬†Key minerals like¬†**zinc**¬†are vital for maintaining testosterone levels, which are important for libido and performance. Foods like¬†**oysters**,¬†**lean meats**, and¬†**pumpkin seeds**¬†are good sources. Some studies suggest a link between zinc levels and sexual dysfunction, with a 2023 rat study even showing zinc improved ejaculation latency.¬†**Bananas**¬†(potassium, vitamin B) and¬†**avocados**¬†(healthy fats) also contribute to hormonal balance.
* **Neurotransmitter Regulation:**¬†Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a common pharmacological treatment for PE because serotonin helps delay ejaculation. Foods like¬†**dark chocolate**¬†can naturally boost serotonin levels, promoting relaxation. Bananas, rich in Vitamin B6, can also aid serotonin production.
* **Other Beneficial Nutrients:**¬†Low¬†**magnesium**¬†levels have been associated with PE, as magnesium is crucial for muscle relaxation and nerve function. Foods like¬†**dark chocolate**,¬†**spinach**, and¬†**almonds**¬†are excellent sources. A 2017 study in¬†*Andrologia*¬†found a link between low¬†**vitamin B12**¬†and PE, and a 2019 study in the¬†*International Brazilian Journal of Urology*¬†noted lower¬†**vitamin D**¬†levels in men with acquired PE.

# Foods and Substances to Consider Limiting

Just as some foods can help, others can hinder overall sexual health:

* **Alcohol:**¬†Excessive alcohol consumption is correlated with male sexual dysfunction and may worsen PE.
* **Processed Foods, Sugar, and Unhealthy Fats:**¬†Diets high in these can lead to inflammation, reduced blood flow, and poor metabolic health, indirectly impacting sexual function. Obesity and metabolic syndrome, often linked to such diets, have also been associated with acquired PE.

# Food Sensitivities: A Direct Link to PE?

Current research¬†*does not*¬†directly link diagnosed food sensitivities (e.g., to gluten, dairy, or common allergens) to changes in ejaculatory latency in individuals with PE. While food intolerances can trigger systemic inflammation, and chronic inflammation (like prostatitis) is highly prevalent in men with PE, a direct causal chain from specific food allergies to PE has not been scientifically established. If you suspect a food sensitivity is causing¬†*other*¬†symptoms, consulting an allergy specialist is prudent, but it's not a standard diagnostic pathway for PE. Rare conditions like seminal plasma hypersensitivity (semen allergy) exist, but they primarily affect the¬†*partner*¬†reacting to semen, not the individual's ejaculatory control.

# Diagnosing Premature Ejaculation

Diagnosis of PE primarily involves a thorough medical and sexual history, sometimes using questionnaires like the Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PEDT) or the Premature Ejaculation Profile (PEP). Stopwatch measures of intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) are used in research settings. Currently, no specific diagnostic tests exist to identify food sensitivities as a direct cause of PE.

# Actionable Advice for Patients

1. **Embrace a Balanced Diet:**¬†Focus on whole, unprocessed foods. Incorporate fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats daily.
2. **Prioritize Key Nutrients:**¬†Include foods rich in zinc (oysters, lean meats), magnesium (spinach, dark chocolate, almonds), and omega-3s (walnuts, salmon).
3. **Limit Unhealthy Choices:**¬†Reduce consumption of alcohol, processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive fried or fatty foods.
4. **Stay Hydrated:**¬†Water is essential for overall bodily function.
5. **Manage Weight:**¬†If obesity is a concern, dietary changes combined with regular exercise can improve overall health and potentially influence sexual function.
6. **Don't Rely Solely on Diet:**¬†While beneficial, diet is generally¬†*not*¬†a standalone cure for PE. It complements proven treatments like behavioral techniques (e.g., squeeze or stop-start methods, Kegel exercises), medications (SSRIs, topical anesthetics), and counseling.
7. **Consult a Healthcare Professional:**¬†If you're struggling with PE, the most important step is to talk to a doctor or a urologist. They can provide an accurate diagnosis, rule out underlying medical conditions, and discuss evidence-based treatment options tailored to your situation.

# Conclusion

While the idea of diet directly causing or curing premature ejaculation is not supported by strong scientific evidence, adopting a healthy, balanced diet plays an undeniable supportive role in overall sexual health. By focusing on nutrient-rich foods and limiting processed options, you can positively influence factors like blood flow and hormone balance, which are crucial for sexual well-being. However, remember that effective PE management often requires a multi-faceted approach involving medical guidance, behavioral techniques, and sometimes medication.

I know this is a long time but I was working with BED and every crash diet I tried ended up in misery. I've very slowly lost the weight and even though I was impatient a lot of the times, I was never miserable with my diet since I was only in a 100-150cal deficit. Problem is, I don't see it. Perhaps because it was so slow over 5 years, I've had time to get accustomed to my body at every stage, I don't feel like I've done anything significant but my doctor praises me, relatives I see only once every few years praise me. I used to be size UK 18, delusional 16 buyer, now I'm a 12-14. I have good muscle mass and have very broad shoulders for a woman, and I'm tall, but only a couple of sizes? I've seen people lose 5-10kg and go down like 5 sizes. I always thought once I hit this ""healthy goal weight"", I'd be my ""dream size"" but i'm not. And I have no reason to continue with weightloss when this is the healthiest I'll be, but it's hard to be rational when weightloss didn't come with all the sparkles, sunshine, popularity and dramatics I used as motivation to stick to my plans and goals.

It's also weird because this year, I finally decided to try for halloween and got a cute costume. I won't lie, I think I look good in it, my body looks good in it, I'm proud of myself, but somehow I still feel off about it?

I finally feel like I look like ""one of those girls"" but then my mind humbles me.

It must sound very silly but getting used to a new body that's suddenly appreciated by everyone around me is a challenge. It's like people remember basic human decency when they see me like this but no one was ever kind to my old self, and went out of their way to be mean. Now people open doors for me, smile at me, strangers sometimes pay for my coffee or drinks when I go out at night, people actually smile at me and make an effort to talk and befriend me.

If your mind is clear without attachment or affected by emotions, you would be free this very instant (skip till the middle of the post) but otherwise you will have to walk the way, that is not a bad thing but a good thing, the more you walk slowly the faster you actually arrive, I rushed so many times yet walking one step a time is the fastest.

I am not writing this for normal people with great discerning minds but only either for beginners or people who used to abuse drugs who have numbed their mind and therefore lack discernment, I have not realised Self (whatever it means I don't know) but I am free of the ego completely.

The most effective path that worked for me was pranayama, meaning breath-control, why? because I was always in sympathetic dominance meaning in fight or flight mode in my life because of suffering, pain and people that hurt me, I was never ""calm"" so no matter how many scriptures I read or times I meditated I never got it! Why? because I did not have the nervous system that could hold it or discern the truth, I could not let the water of mind still and the barrage of thoughts stop.

In my mind that was damaged from drug abuse, I could read the words but not internalise them, I could even understand them but not feel them or use them to discern the truth even though I read countless scriptures, I just felt them to be nihilistic and they hurt me and made me despair at times, I was way too emotional and hurt and the truth was very unexpected.

What intense pranayama did to me was first my intense suffering disappeared after 2 weeks of daily 2-3h of pranayama through the nose that have long breath holds like 6-12-6-12 which is my favourite, I did intense techniques with long holds, these forced my nervous system to calm down by activating the vagus nerve that signals calmness and entering parasympathetic mode, I did these breathing techniques daily to avoid suffering, I would let suffering come and hurt me yet continue the breaths.

Another thing it did was make my nervous system stronger and able to bear more gradually, what this meant was pain was way less intense, heat and cold was way less intense, and the greatest thing EVER was emotions no longer moved me, I could keep calm and not have my heart beating all the time whatever arose me even suicidal thoughts, that does no mean I do not feel emotions like sadness but I no longer feel depression or despair at all and even the sadness even if I partake in it doesn't affect me in my depth.

Anyway practice pranayama or meditation but for me meditation is near impossible, my mind could never keep quit and not distract me by breathing in and out, I had to follow a timer of pranayama which is much easier, I also fixed my diet and went into the sun, the point is you have to make sure your body isn't disturbing because if it disturbs you it disturbs your mind.

**Anyway so you want the truth?**

**How do we become free of this world?**

**My friend, please tell when were you not free?**

**Pranayama for me absolutely cleansed everything. It was so quiet that I began to discern ""Oh I didn't actually will this movement of my hand"" ""Oh, that thought happened by itself?"" When talking to people, I could even forget myself and only remember after the talking happened.**

**I could still my mind enough to began to discern, the first epiphany came from reading ""the flight of the garuda""** I read it and read it, it was so simple and clear, no complicated words, everything easy.

The gist of it is ""Just don't fabricate or fixate and notice!""

Reading these scriptures while calm changed everything, the meaning entered the depth and like a seed began to sprout.

Before reading anything about awareness would cause nihilism to manifest in me as well as pressure to the chest, I could never just be calm and read it without fear.

**After reading it, I could walk and just move the sight of my eye from place to place** **and walk in silence.**

But even then, I still couldn't figure out the truth until I began to discern using the techniques flight of the garuda.

Do this : ""when a thought comes, see where it came from, see where it is when it arises, and see where it goes when it vanishes!""

Do this from a perception pov, don't do it like I did with a drug abused brain meaning do it using the ego, Rest behind the ego but you can't do this without pranayama if your mind is weak at discerning or is too emotional, what pranayama does is you can go a length of time in silence, me in normal times thoughts were so fast and there was so much pain meaning I could not just ""be"", just feeling your body was impossible for me, I never just felt my body and moved.

**Anyway, so I began to investigate, I would wait for a thought yet I found it hard to catch a thought at all like a person fishing but not catching anything, it was impossible, why? because it came from behind me like an assassin, I would become the thought without even feeling it, only after it became me did I notice ""Ah, it got me""**

After long investigation, I noticed there were two types of thoughts, thoughts that were like birds coming in flying in front of you, you can see them and they don't grab you, but some other thoughts **they become you without you even noticing!**

**You are not the one fearing or suffering or hating or with any evil thought, the opposite, you are actually the joy, the love and everything good and stable however at the same time not with ego, meaning without possession.**

So anyway I investigated, with my being I searched where the thought came from, where they stayed when they existed and where they vanished and I failed completely, thoughts come from nothing and return to nothing, **the breakthrough was where the thought was when it arised, at one point, I was so still that half way through a thought I detached from it and it continued on its own and in that moment, the following thoughts I focused on where they arose yet when I put my attention on them, they seemed so far away**,  like looking at something in the far horizon, the thought being the horizon, I was shocked

**Later on in that same state, I tried to investigate the world without the ego, and when I did, I felt the world was so far away like we were into two different dimensions, and I felt the world wasn't solid, not that it was fluid or any of that shit, just it wasn't dividable and it had nothing in it that was seperate but you would say in my life, I see solid objects and they are different and they are solid and vivid.**

**Here is the problem with any investigation, you take the ego with you and investigate with it! I never noticed any of this until I was in the state where I felt thought was far and I was just seeing without any thought and from that base I did the investigation, what I noticed was that seperation and unity were not different, yes the objects are seperate yet that seperation doesn't negate that perception is one.**

Problem is trying to understand it with your mind and ego, in that base where thought felt far and I was discerning all the time, I felt with absolute certainty that I wasn't the actor, there was no doubt in my mind at all.

*Point is you would realise this faster if you just give up without doing the giving up, but* ***IF YOU ARE LIKE ME I WILL SWEAR TO YOU IT WILL NEVER WORK FOR YOU!***

Why did it work for me? am I special?

**Because I did INTENSE BREATHWORK** with long holds after exhales, I handled that pressure in the body countless times for a total 180h of practice with intense ratios like 6-12-6-12 or 8-16-8-16, **I always pushed myself hard on breathwork, so when it came time to be centerless, there was significant pressure but it wasn't as hard as doing 12s hold after a long exhale after 1h of doing it constantly**

**The Ego was used that that pressure in the body doesn't kill us, so there was no resistance**

**There! There was freedom for a moment before an intense fear invaded, same as that pressure, it came it manifested I expected I would be pulled back, for some unknown reason I wasn't pulled by the ego, maybe you can call it grace, I just stayed centerless, emotions invaded, fear, love, sadness, depression, some past painful memories, if not for pranayama I would have been pulled back but I was used to the pressure**

**After this I became centerless, I didn't know where I was going or who I am, I would talk to someone naturally, a second later I'd forget I even met him, I was in uni and Its been a month and I didn't study knowing I had dropped out of college and for 5 years did nothing and it was a huge trauma, I wasn't pulled, the fear came, it stayed, it faded like it never existed.**

**I remained centerless, at a point the ego PULLED ME HARD, NO REACTION, THERE WAS NO ONE TO FIGHT IT AND THUS IT VANISHED.**

Point is in this state, there was no bliss like a pleasure, there was not even peace, there was just presence that is not anyway special or different than you right now existing, it was natural, you can call it **naturalness**

But what about pain or discomfort?

For now, there is non-resistance meaning things come, they stay and they depart or they stay as long as they want

The next day, I drank coffee (it just happened) and the ego re-emerged powerful, I talked with people and laughed with them, **the ego was present Yet for some unknown reason whenever the ego feared even a minimal fear it didn't affect my being at all despite pressure in the chest!**

The ego would come and go as it wished, there was being with people and doing things **YET it was as if nothing happened or everything happened by itself**

When there is no fixation, there is no recalling, therefore things appear, events happen, things move and then as if none of it happened.

I don't talk to people, talking happens naturally, I don't do virtue, virtue happens by itself, even when the ego is careful and avoids something it doesn't affect me **because it is allowed**

**I realised the ""ego"" is just the survival mechanism of the body, it is not evil, But when Awareness identifies with the ego, the ego becomes restless, Awareness sees itself as the ego and suffering is experienced, it doesn't affect awareness but it is nonetheless experienced.**

**From my point of view now, the ego when it is not believed to be oneself is the expression of Awareness and it reflects what Awareness is in its essence, its the vehicle to express joy, love, peace without any possession of those things.**

**Even when there are thoughts like ""Oh Fuck it will fade away"" or ""There is still more to find, perhaps there is bliss elsewhere"" they are either noticed as you seeing a bird fly in front of you or an assassin coming behind to stab you except when the assassin comes to stab you, when he delivers the death blow, he finds nothing to hurt or kill**.

The way I see it now, the world is just Awareness experiencing itself through different forms and expressions.

1oec34n,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1oec34n/drowned_dreamer_part_12/,Drowned Dreamer Part 12,"It was raining that day when Alex and I approached the front yard of that pristine house. It was quiet in that neighborhood, flagstone steps framed with thick moss paved the way to a blood red door. The lights were on, but the curtains were drawn. I knew he was in there, waiting for me to show up. Alex paused at the base of the porch, nodding at me as I gripped the brass knocker in my wet fingers. I rapped it hard, and didn‚Äôt wait for a response before calling, ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre in there Damien! You owe me‚Äù

The door creaked open, and he stood there with fear in his eyes. His hair was a mess, and his eyes were dark, like he hadn‚Äôt slept for several days. A small bruise discolored his bottom left jaw, and his lip had an old cut right at the corner. He wore a soft light sweater and loose pants, though he was taller than me, he looked deflated and tired. Damien looked at me, then nodded at Alex, before opening the door and retreating into his home.

Inside it was tidy, pale sofas lined the living room, a record player sat idly next to tall bookshelves neatly organized with records and strange artworks. His fireplace was whitewashed, and looked like it hadn‚Äôt been used at all. He sat in a tall wooden dining chair, before a polished and empty table, slumping forward into his hands as I lingered by the door. Alex plopped onto the sofa, placing his wet boots on the glass coffee table. He sat there in silence, a subtle expression of amusement on his face, waiting for the show to start.

‚ÄúJack, I‚Äôm so sorry‚Äù Damien broke the silence. Alex scoffed from his seat across the room, ‚Äúat the time, that was the best way I could show you why- why everything went wrong‚Äù

‚ÄúYou dumped me in the ocean Damien, how was that supposed to help?‚Äù I answered harshly.

Damien lifted his gaze, facing me, ‚ÄúYou just don't understand what‚Äôs been going on around here, and I had to show you‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd what a good job you did there‚Äù Alex remarked, flicking the pages of a magazine, ‚Äútossing Jack into the water to drown.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was going to go in after you Jack, but this guy‚Äù Damien jutted a thumb towards Alex, ‚ÄúFucking punched the shit out of me‚Äù 

‚ÄúNot my problem‚Äù Alex declared, amusedly.

‚ÄúAre you gonna get to the point Damien?‚Äù I demanded.


‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, it's just really hard to explain this‚Äù

‚ÄúFucking try harder then‚Äù I retorted, leaning against the doorframe.

‚ÄúOk- Ok‚Ä¶‚Äù Damien took a few seconds to find his words, ‚ÄúYou saw something out there right?‚Äù I nodded, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where I came from‚Äù He paused.

I remained silent, so Damien kept going, ‚ÄúYou see, my family has a different kind of life cycle from you‚Ä¶ we go into the water‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ go into the water?‚Äù I repeated bluntly. 

‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôre born there, and we come back on land, and when we get older we have to return.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAnd that thing‚Ä¶?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes, that's what we become when we return, or at least that‚Äôs what he became, I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs complicated‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy uncle, he‚Äôs the Deep King‚Äù Damien said, relief crossing his eyes.

‚ÄúWhat a load of bullshit‚Äù Alex interjected, ‚ÄúJack, this guy‚Äôs playing you‚Äù 

‚ÄúShut up Alex‚Äù I responded, ‚ÄúDamien, why are you telling me this?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause I know who took your sister.‚Äù Damien turned his icy gaze back to me, ‚Äúit was him. He took her‚Äù 

My breath caught, ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù I rasped.

‚ÄúMy father was the Deep King,‚Äù he continued, ‚ÄúAnd you have to understand, things work differently out there, different rules. It's not a huge community, and my species is dependent on land-dwellers to survive, we‚Äôre only males, so we have to find wives on land.‚Äù He shifted uncomfortably, ‚ÄúNot long after you and I broke up, my Uncle‚Ä¶ he killed my father, and then he became the Deep King. That‚Äôs when things changed, everything changed‚Ä¶ I had to change.‚Äù

‚ÄúH-how?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúGod this would be so much easier to explain if you knew the language, it‚Äôs hard to translate. Basically, we don‚Äôt die of old age, and the system runs like a‚Ä¶ monarchy? My father‚Ä¶ His guidance forbade the old ways: kidnapping and pillaging. But my uncle‚Ä¶‚Äù he raked his hand along his neck, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs spiteful.‚Äù Damien‚Äôs face softened, his eyes looking faraway, ‚ÄúBefore, I thought he was just passionate, strong, confident. It always seemed like he knew what to do, in any situation. But when I told him about you, he just got so angry. It was like you had stolen from him, or spat on his legacy.‚Äù

‚Äú...What the fuck did I do?‚Äù I spat. ‚ÄúHow is this my fault?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not Jack!‚Äù Damien fidgeted, ‚ÄúI think something happened when he was dry- living on land, and now he‚Äôs taking it out on you. When we were together it didn‚Äôt seem like anything was going wrong, my family was happy for me and excited for us to‚Ä¶ unite, but when it turned out that you were-um‚Ä¶ trans, it's like suddenly they all turned against you. He turned against you‚Äù My blood was heating at the direction his story was going, but I let him continue. ‚ÄúMy father encouraged me to look for someone new, to find myself, but my uncle got more radical. He even told me I should kidnap you like the old days, of course I refused, and it didn‚Äôt really matter once you went to New York, so I figured it was over‚Äù Alex scoffed loudly, but Damien pressed on, ‚ÄúI would never do anything to hurt you Jack, but I can‚Äôt control my Uncle, he‚Äôs the king, and I‚Äôm his heir.‚Äù

My throat was tight. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù 

‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶ There's no perfect way to translate it, but it's an archaic custom similar to payment or reparations for a past wrongdoing. He was punishing you‚Äù

My fists clenched. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you saying?‚Äù I growled through gritted teeth.
‚ÄúHe needs to be stopped, and I can‚Äôt do it without you, it needs to be two people‚Äù

Suddenly, Alex was on his feet. He stormed over and lifted Damien by his shirt collar, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is wrong with you man? What kind of bullshit are you trying to pull!‚Äù 

‚ÄúNothing! Listen, I know I deserve it! I deserve your hatred, but you deserve the truth and here it is!‚Äù

‚ÄúTruth?‚Äù Alex roared, ‚ÄúThis is the biggest load of crap I‚Äôve ever heard! You‚Äôre full of shit and just playing the hero to fuck with Jack‚Äù 

‚ÄúIf that was true then why are you here?‚Äù Damien retorted, ‚ÄúWhy would I let you in my fucking house?‚Äù 

‚ÄúStop it! Both of you‚Äù I yelled. Alex glared at Damien for a long minute before finally releasing him.

I took a deep breath, ‚ÄúOk, so what I know is that my sister was taken from her home, she reported she was being stalked, something pale and slimy and making squishing sounds.‚Äù 

‚ÄúShe was scared she could have imagine-‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up Alex!‚Äù I remarked, ‚ÄúShe was found on the beach, soaking wet, and she can‚Äôt tell her story of what happened to her. We know that there‚Äôs ruins off the coast, and for some reason that photographer wouldn‚Äôt go to them, and I know that I saw something in the water.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou could have imagined that too Jack‚Äù Alex said softer.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt imagine it last night Alex‚Äù I glared at him coldly. Recognition flooded his eyes, and he 
slowly backed down. ‚ÄúDamien, how can you prove this to us?‚Äù I finally asked.

He remained silent.

‚ÄúDamien, if what you‚Äôre saying is true, then I want him dead too. Whoever did this to my sister should die and right now you‚Äôre telling me you know who it is.‚Äù 

Damien‚Äôs eyes took on a faraway look, ‚ÄúThere are.. paintings, in the tunnels. They tell our story, but it‚Äôs going to be hard to get there‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have to show us‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúIf you want any good will from me, you‚Äôre going to have to prove your story.‚Äù

We set off at dusk, flashlights in hand and Damien led us to a nearby manhole. He pried it open with a crowbar before replacing it in his belt, and climbed down into the sewer, ‚ÄúAll of these tunnels lead to the ocean, they‚Äôre interconnected. Some sections lead to the cave system we lived in since the beginning.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe beginning of what?‚Äù I asked as my shoes soaked in rainwater and god knows what else.

‚ÄúI guess the birth of our species.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSo what, are you guys aliens or some kind of human seal?‚Äù Alex needled.

‚ÄúFunny you mention that,‚Äù Damien replied, ‚ÄúSome cultures do think of us like that, human seals. There are groups of us all over the world, just about every culture has some story. Sometimes we‚Äôre magical spirits, other times Gods, sometimes just weird looking people‚Äù

Alex slowed his pace to walk next to me, ‚ÄúJackie, what are you doing? I know you‚Äôre desperate for answers but-ugh gross‚Äù Alex‚Äôs boot squelched in something rancid, ‚ÄúBut why this? Why trust him of all people after what he did?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust him Alex.‚Äù I responded, not caring if Damien could hear, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you‚Äôre here, if he tries anything there will be two of us.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah but he has a crowbar‚Äù

‚ÄúDamien!‚Äù I called. He turned around, his pale face glistening in the beam of my flashlight, ‚ÄúGive Alex your crowbar.‚Äù I commanded.

Damien eyed Alex suspiciously before handing it over. Turned on his heel, and continued through the muck.

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù I said sheepishly. But inside I could feel the anxiety building up, doubt creeping into the edges of my mind. I shut down those feelings, if Damien‚Äôs story is true, then I have to do something about it. I have no choice.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre coming up on the turnoff, it should be around here soon‚Äù Damien called, the air was beginning to smell sweeter with the salt of the ocean.

The walls of the tunnel turned rough as we rounded an irregular corner, the cave slanted up, and the filth we had been walking in dried into gritty sandstone. Striations in the rocks outlined millenia of weather, and we climbed into an open space of the deepest blackness. The air was cold and carrying a sense of dread that something was lurking deep within that shadow. 

‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here.‚Äù Damien said simply, as he pointed his lamp to the walls. 
There, in the sandstone, was a multitude of paintings. Lovingly kept and untouched by graffiti or weathering. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not allowed to show this to outsiders, you‚Äôre the first one Jack‚Äù Damien announced. Alex coughed from behind me, annoyed.

I remained silent as I studied the walls. Hundreds of figures, rendered like ancient petroglyphs, detailing what must have been centuries of history. Figures in the water, with elongated legs. Figures holding children, setting them on a shoreline. Figures in battle, spears flying towards massive sharks, whales, and squid. Figures prostrating before a massive centerpiece, a creature with an elongated neck, seated upon a strange throne. Such shapes sent me through waves of panic and anxiety, something I shouldn‚Äôt see, something mythic and strange. A lost history meant to remain hidden. That face was rendered in a multitude of repeating fractal patterns that radiated out from two piercing eyes. In one hand a knife dripping with blood, in the other a cup overflowing with water.

I shined my light on this piece, ‚ÄúIs this..?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Deep King, yes, my father once.‚Äù Damien responded.

I panned my light to the left of the figure, working my way counterclockwise around the room. Figures rendered obviously male and female, in pairs, swimming together. Female figures with strange markings on the necks. A woman bound to a rock with the bleeding knife and overflowing cup rendered above her. I shuddered as I continued, my limbs tingled with the implications of that scene. Men were carrying women over their shoulders, wading into the water, those markings dotting the necks of each captive, ‚ÄúThis is what you were talking about?‚Äù I stammered, ‚ÄúThe old ways?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúIt's barbaric, I know, but it‚Äôs not supposed to be literal, like a metaphor, or mythical history.‚Äù 

‚ÄúLike the Sabine women‚Äù I murmured, remembering the old story from Rome‚Äôs early days.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù He agreed.

I shined my light to the furthest wall. There I saw a massive piece, so detailed I could hardly describe its shape and form. It was a mountain of repeating fractal patterns, winding and spindling tendrils emerging from some symmetrical center, eyes that seemed to grow and shrink with the shadows in the stone. My mind was repulsed, involuntarily I tried to look away, but the draw of that shape was too powerful. I couldn‚Äôt tear myself away, despite the pressure building behind my eyes. The longer I looked the more I could piece together: somehow this was a creature, it had no legs but it seemed to be squatting, and between its appendages the figures emerged as they began their journey around the room. I looked at Damien, waiting for an explanation.

‚ÄúDagon‚Äù he said simply, reflexively, before turning away to examine some other aspect.

I finally noticed Alex, who was standing there stone cold, ‚ÄúYou ok?‚Äù I asked.

He was pale as bone, his jaw hanging slack, ‚ÄúYeah man, I think we should go‚Äù

Later I lay awake on Alex‚Äôs bed, having showered the stench from my body and leaving my boots outside, he and I stared at the ceiling.

‚ÄúIs that‚Ä¶ proof?‚Äù I asked him.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù was all he answered, ‚ÄúDecide for yourself‚Äù 

Neither of us slept that night.

Honestly, it will be more than one book. I probably have enough to fill three. 

  
For context, I was a professor at a small liberal arts college that had a lot of problems. I thought that everybody at this school had a PhD in dysfunction. Crazy stuff was happening so often that started keeping a journal that would help me recount events years later. I am providing a sample chapter and I am looking for some feedback. If you are inclined, let me know what you think.

# [A Disorienting Orientation]()[]()

The first day on the job is like the first day of school. You want to dress up all snazzy and wash behind your ears so your first impression can wow your new colleagues. But, when you are fresh from the academic womb that nurtured you to pursue the illustrious graduate degree you nearly starved for, options to impress them with your fashion sense are often slim. Unless, of course, you come from a family with a trust fund. In that case, I despise you. I hope you choke on your own rhetoric during a paper presentation about why your navel is superior because it has thirteen percent less lint than the previous model at the National Nitwit Association conference. I am so glad you found your niche project that answers nothing but the whiny problems you and two other charlatans created as an academic subgenre that can only exist because of academic freedom. Congratulations on opening your own program about such a worthless endeavor. I don't know how you even market such an insane scheme. I applaud you if you can swindle some students into thinking they will become fore-thinkers in the hermeneutics of belly button autoethnography. The only future your pupils will have will be as an online adjunct for a for-profit school in a New Mexico garage. Honestly, I both admire and loathe you. I will never be able to stare at my belly button with such a level of awe that I find a birth scar so enchanting, nor will I ever comprehend how you can sleep at night knowing what kind of hack fraud you are. Having dozens of graduates who will teach from a coffee shop with free Wi-Fi because of the student debt they accrued under your tutelage could have bought them a European sports car instead.

For the rest of us working academic stiffs, the first day on a new campus will create lasting impressions on your new colleagues, whether they are good or bad or leave bruises. Regardless, my first day at Remus started by having us eight new hires gather in a small conference room on the north end of campus. We all exchange pleasantries before our new boss walks in to get us acclimated to the environment. The meeting starts mundane enough with an introduction from the Vice President of Academic Affairs, Dr. Bella Stalwart. Dr. Stalwart has a tall and slender countenance. She appears to be closer to middle age, as there is also a motherly aura about her as she speaks. However, she commands the room with her physical presence. The kind of demeanor that could quickly instill that maternal guilt most of us grew up with. You remember it. The worst thing you could possibly do was disappoint her, but if you were looking to sign your own death warrant, you made her mad.

Most of the orientation meanders around the mundane functions of a faculty member and the general responsibilities attached to the position. A broad spectrum of topics is discussed, including attendance, registration, and office hours. However, I notice a change in Dr. Stalwart's demeanor as she discusses the student body. The conversation goes from cheer and mirth and dives into a tone reminiscent of those wise elders who warn the hero about the tribulations they will face on their journey. Thankfully, Dr. Stalwart has no milky eye, long beard, or weather-beaten oak staff to drive the point home.

Dr. Stalwart begins to discuss the students who enroll at Remus College. There is a stern warning administered to every one of us. The edict is as follows, ""whatever you do, do not ask where your students are from."" In my mind, I find this perplexing. Part of how I identify with my students is that I get to know a little about their hometowns. I can relate to them by discussing their favorite sports teams, local food, and attractions. It shows that I kind of care about the kids I am teaching. Now I am told that I cannot even bring up hometowns. What in the world for? However, before I have time to formulate a response, Dr. Stalwart follows this commandment with a rationale. ""Students are territorial and are very protective; therefore, if you begin to discuss things of that nature, it might lead to a fight in class.""

I feel the need to collect myself after receiving this information. The notion that students might fight over the fact that they live somewhere else almost gives me a complex. I recall Stalwart's odd questions during the interview about diffusing situations in the classroom. My response was that I often use humor to handle any situation. Experience has taught me that quick wit can tackle most circumstances. Now it seems like I must brush up on my martial arts skills to make it through my nine o'clock class.

For context, I grew up just outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and there is a long-standing rivalry between my hometown and the city of Cleveland. As much as we may ridicule anybody from that part of Lake Erie or harass those unfortunate souls who root for teams that play in a town where the primary export is crippling depression, none of it ever came to punches. I would never commit physical harm to somebody who had the misfortune of living near the Cuyahoga River or supported those teams. At worst, you would say something horrible about the players or their mothers and leave it at that. As far as I was concerned, those poor people suffered enough just because they lived in Ohio.

Apparently, fights were common in the classroom over trivial matters like what street you happen to live on. What kind of students does this school admit? I don't know if I want to come to work at a place where I need to wear a complete umpire's uniform to class so that I can make it through the day. A fun little fact about baseball umpires, in the early 20th century, eight of them were murdered during baseball games by fans. It brings new meaning to the term ""kill the ump."" I fancy myself an adventurous soul, but I prefer not to get shot while discussing Walter Benjamin. I admired the man, but I didn't want to die in a similar fashion.

After the orientation, I drove to my apartment, thinking about my life choices. What did I do to deserve this fate? Will I survive this first semester? Should I invest in brass knuckles and a bulletproof vest? Despite my fears, I decided that I was going to muscle my way through this job. I am going to ignore Stalwart's warnings and teach the way that I know how. I just hope the students have a sense of humor. Otherwise, I might have to learn some of those takedown moves I see mixed martial artists do.",2,1761246343.0,coworkerstories,1,1.0,False

Where did I go wrong?,"I consider myself a bit of a foodie, with Thai, indian, and Vietnamese my favorite cuisines. I was very excited to try the food in New Orleans and made it a central part of my trip (using the FAQ as a guide for restaurants I chose) I would often order the ""flavor of new orleans"" dishes. My review:

Jumbalaya: burnt dry rice with a smattering of Cayenne. ""smokey flavor"" if Im being generous. Where is the spicy flavor that I heard so much about?

Gumbo: sour, tasted like alcohol, random floating sausage with few to no vegetables. I was excited for a hearty dish and was surprised by how watery it was. Maybe its like pho and requires a bit more aquired taste around the nuance of the broth?

Grits: my biggest disappointment. Where Im from, they serve a (what I now realize is bastardized) version of  grits thats creamy, cheesy, spicy and stock full of tomatoes, veggies and choice of protein. I was expecting that, so very surprised to receive watery buttery rice. Next time I ordered spicy shrimp and grits, and that was 3/10 spicy shrimp on top of the watery buttery rice.

poboys and seafood: 10/10 very much enjoyed

Desserts: 50% of the desserts were delicious, 50% were VERY dry. like put coffee creamer on the cake so it is edible levels of dry.

deep fried foods: tried lots of deep fried foods. alligator, hushpuppies, macn cheese etc. All extremely dry. Shocked they didnt serve any of it with a sauce.

Collared Greens: I was craving vegetables half way though the trip and this was (shockingly) often the only vegetable served? somehow it was simultaneously too bitter, sour and sweet

Anyways. Im happy to have had a new experience, but was a little disappointed. Thought I would post to manage expectations of new tourists.  I like creamy, spicy, and vegetable based dishes. what should I have ordered?

Update: not a rage post. just managing expectations. I ate at coterie, crescent city brewhouse, Cochon, Toups cafe reconcile (that I can remember)

Coterie and cochon were good, but their ""taste of New orleans"" dishes were still lacking. 

I will say many of the FAQ restaurants were SUPER busy. Like 2 hour wait time. I seriously spent a good portion of my evening going from restaurant to restaurant in the FAQ searching for ones without horrible wait times.

Three weeks ago, my ex sent me a text out of nowhere. We dated for two years before I met my husband. The breakup was mutual, nothing messy. The text said he missed me and wondered if we could talk. I screenshotted it and showed my husband that night while we were watching TV.

""My ex texted me,"" I said. ""Says he misses me.""

My husband glanced at the screen, then back at the TV. ""Okay.""

""That's it? Just okay?""

He shrugged. ""What do you want me to say?""

I don't know what I expected. Maybe jealousy. Maybe anger. Something that proved he still cared. We'd been married four years and things had gone stale. He worked late constantly. We barely talked anymore. I felt invisible.

""What if I wanted to see him?"" I pushed.

My husband looked at me then. Really looked at me. His face was completely blank. ""Then see him.""

""You're serious?""

""Follow your heart,"" he said. Then he went back to watching TV like I hadn't just told him I was considering my ex.

I was furious. What kind of husband says that? I wanted a reaction. I wanted him to fight for me. Instead, he acted like he didn't care if I left.

So I texted my ex back. We met for coffee two days later. He looked good. He asked about my marriage and I told him the truth, that it felt dead. He listened. He remembered things about me my husband had forgotten. My favorite coffee order. The book series I loved. Small things that suddenly felt huge.

We met again. And again. Each time, I'd come home and my husband wouldn't ask where I'd been. He'd just nod when I walked in and go back to whatever he was doing.

Last week, I crossed the line. I went to my ex's place and we slept together. I felt disgusting afterward but also triumphant in a sick way. I'd finally done something my husband would have to react to.

I came home at midnight. My husband was still up, reading on the couch.

""I slept with my ex,"" I said.

He closed his book slowly. Looked at me. ""I know.""

""You know? How do you know?""

""You're not subtle,"" he said. ""You've been trying to hurt me for weeks.""

""And you just let me?""

""You wanted to leave. I wasn't going to stop you.""

I waited for the anger. The pain. Something. His face showed nothing.

""That's it? You're not even going to yell at me?""

""What's the point?"" He stood up. ""I'll sleep in the guest room tonight. We can figure out divorce details tomorrow.""

He walked away. Just like that. I'd blown up our marriage expecting fireworks and got a quiet exit instead.

Two days later, my best friend stopped returning my calls. We'd been close for six years. She knew everything about my marriage problems. I'd cried to her about my husband a dozen times. When she finally texted back, she said she needed space. Wouldn't explain why.

Yesterday, I went to our favorite restaurant to clear my head. The place my friend and I always went to for drinks. And there they were. My husband and my best friend. Sitting in a corner booth. Laughing. Her hand was on his arm. He was smiling at her the way he used to smile at me.

I stood there frozen by the entrance. My husband saw me. He didn't look surprised. He didn't look guilty. He just gave me this small nod, like we were strangers passing on the street.

My friend saw me too. She had the decency to look uncomfortable, but she didn't move her hand.

I turned around and left. I sat in my car for an hour trying to understand what I'd just seen. Then it hit me. The way he'd been so calm about everything. The ""follow your heart"" comment. The complete lack of reaction when I confessed.

He'd already moved on. Probably weeks ago. Maybe months. While I was busy trying to hurt him with my ex, he was already building something new with someone I trusted.

I drove to my sister's house and told her everything. She just stared at me.

""You cheated to get a reaction and he'd already checked out,"" she said. ""That's brutal.""

""He could have told me,"" I said.

""You could have not slept with your ex,"" she shot back.

My family found out over the weekend. They're split. My mom says I should have handled things better. My dad won't talk to me. My brother called me selfish. They all think I destroyed my marriage for attention.

But here's the thing. My husband never said he wanted out. He never fought for us. He just let me spiral while he was apparently getting cozy with my best friend behind my back.

I confronted her last night over text. She said nothing physical happened between them until after I confessed to cheating. She said she'd been his shoulder to cry on for months. That he'd talked to her about our problems. That she ""didn't plan for feelings to develop.""

My husband won't answer my calls. His lawyer sent divorce papers this morning. My best friend blocked me on everything. My ex stopped replying after I told him I'd made a mistake.

I'm sitting here in my sister's spare room realizing I'm the villain in everyone's story. I cheated first. I threw away my marriage testing my husband. But he gave up on us and started something with my best friend while we were still married. Everyone keeps saying that what he did came after, but it doesn't feel that way.

So am I really the only one in the wrong here?

Maybe I just wasn‚Äôt trying hard enough.

So I kept pushing. I made lists, drank more coffee, kept showing up, and quietly fell apart inside.

Last month I got a CT scan. It showed severe chronic sinus inflammation. Apparently it has been pressing on my brain, possibly for years. The doctor said it could explain the fatigue, memory issues, and cognitive dysfunction, and suddenly everything clicked.

I sat in the parking lot and cried. I felt relief, because it wasn‚Äôt all in my head. I also felt grief, thinking about how long I had been blaming myself for something that was never my fault.

Tomorrow I have a short call with my doctor to try to get medical leave. I‚Äôm scared they won‚Äôt take me seriously. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll sound ‚Äúfine‚Äù and be told to keep pushing through it. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can do that.

1oebqb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_onecallweb001/comments/1oebqb5/affordable_web_design_in_anaheim_a_small_business/,Affordable Web Design in Anaheim: A Small Business Guide,"In the heart of Southern California, Anaheim stands as a beacon of innovation, tourism, and vibrant local commerce. Home to world-famous attractions and a thriving community of small businesses, the digital landscape here is as competitive as it is promising. For an Anaheim business, your website is more than just a digital business card; it's your 24/7 storefront, your most persuasive salesperson, and the cornerstone of your local identity. Yet, the perceived high cost of professional web design often leaves many entrepreneurs with an outdated, underperforming site, or worse, no online presence at all.

This is where the narrative must change. At One-Call Web Design & Digital Marketing Services, we believe that a powerful, effective, and beautifully designed website should be accessible to every business, from the start up operating out of a home garage to the established restaurant looking to expand its reach. We specialize in delivering top-tier,¬†[**Affordable Web Design in Anaheim**](https://onecallwebdesign.com/website-design-company-in-anaheim/)¬†that doesn‚Äôt cut corners on quality or results. This guide will explore why a professional website is non-negotiable, what truly defines¬†**Anaheim Budget-friendly Web Design Services**, and why One-Call is the premier partner for Anaheim businesses ready to dominate their digital domain.

**Why Your Anaheim Business Can't Survive with an Amateur Website**

In a city that draws millions of visitors and hosts a digitally-savvy local population, your website is often the first point of contact with potential customers. A weak first impression can be devastating to your bottom line.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **The Digital First Impression:**¬†When a potential customer searches for ""best coffee shop near Disneyland"" or ""reliable IT support in Anaheim,"" they are met with a list of options. Your website has mere seconds to capture their attention. A slow, cluttered, or non-mobile-friendly site will send them directly to your competitor. Professional¬†[**Web Design Services in Anaheim**](https://onecallwebdesign.com/website-design-company-in-anaheim/)¬†are essential for making a powerful and positive first impression.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Local Search Visibility is everything:**¬†Google and other search engines prioritize websites that offer a great user experience fast loading speeds, mobile responsiveness, and secure connections. Without a professionally built website, you are invisible in local search results, missing out on the high-intent customers who are actively looking for your services¬†right now.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Building Trust and Credibility:**¬†A polished, modern website signals to customers that you are a legitimate, established, and trustworthy business. It shows you care about your brand and your customer's experience. In an era of online scams, a professional site is your single most powerful tool for building consumer confidence.

**Demystifying Affordable Web Design: What ""Budget-Friendly"" Really Means**

The term ""affordable"" can be misleading. For some, it suggests a cheap, template-based, one-size-fits-all solution. At One-Call, we define¬†[**Anaheim Affordable Web Design**](https://onecallwebdesign.com/website-design-company-in-anaheim/)¬†as¬†strategic, high-value design at a fair price. It‚Äôs about maximizing your return on investment by focusing on the elements that truly drive growth and customer engagement.

Our¬†**Budget-friendly Web Design Services in Anaheim**¬†are built on a foundation of essential features that deliver real results:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Customized, Mobile-First Design:**¬†We don't just use a generic template. We create a custom design that reflects your unique brand identity and is built from the ground up to perform flawlessly on smartphones and tablets, where the majority of web traffic originates.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Foundations:**¬†Your beautiful website is useless if no one can find it. We build with SEO best practices in mind, ensuring your site has a clean structure, proper tags, and optimized content to help you rank higher in search results for Anaheim-based searches.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **User-Friendly Content Management System (CMS):**¬†You maintain full control. We provide easy-to-use tools so you can update your content, add new products, or publish blog posts without needing to learn how to code or pay a developer for every small change.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Clear and Transparent Pricing:**¬†With One-Call, there are no hidden fees or surprise charges. We provide clear, upfront proposals so you know exactly what you‚Äôre investing in and the value it will deliver.

1oebp3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/PercyJacksonfanfic/comments/1oebp3m/some_feedback/,Some Feedback?,"Basically I get really anxious when I actually get to the stage of writing and because of this I like to find ways to relieve this problem and to do that I wanted to come here and just go kinda on a rant of sort and please feel free to use any of these ideas for inspiration just please give some sort of credit to me in some way and leave a link for me to read your work!

Idea 1. My first idea and the one that will be given my main priority when I start writing. I have already posted about this one but have added to it even further and will be brief on what I have gone over (Maybe) (And if you want a link for that post feel free to ask!). Herald of Destruction- Percy Jackson is the Son of Poseidon and (Tho Unknowingly) Amphitrite, This causes his abilities to be stronger as a whole because in my Au Amphitrite is not Queen in just name she is the Yin to Poseidon Yang. Her powers are calm to Poseidon's chaos and Percy will also feel a higher connection to Atlantis and have Merman-like features (i.e Harder skin, taller, shark like teeth, stronger and slightly different lungs, Dilated eyes meant to see in the dark, and [Blue hair so dark it almost looks black)](https://www.reddit.com/r/HairDye/comments/1dqwxmg/strong_blue_dye_that_can_go_over_black/). Percy is also born with an innate connection to the domain of destruction that actually in the beginning actually harms him because his body has yet to mature and grow enough for the domain to be wielded properly but the domain of destruction insists on being used now and not later (Because in the universe Domains are Semi-Sentient, Non-Physical being). But what causes the biggest change in this universe is Artemis while on vacation (i.e The Hunt 'forces' Artemis to take vacation from Dec 26-Jan 15 or 21 days) meets Sally and after a friendly conversation decides to have coffee days later, and is surprised to learn that Sally could see through her disguise and after that its a slope of Artemis meeting Percy, Befriending both Percy and Sally, Falling for Sally, Deciding to adopt Percy after a week of courting (Successfully) Sally, but not before getting permission from Poseidon and Amphitrite after a long (Argument) talk and after that its a slippery slope of adventure. I don't have too many plans for anything after than thoooo. But an idea for the story that I feel the need to share is that in this universe the Gods are like 3x as strong and the Immortality process is different. Basically Gods are born as Godling's where they spend 500\~ years as half-immortals where they can in fact dies but stop physically aging by 25 and are 10x harder to kill than a mortal is. During this period is when they 'earn' domains, where their actions and achievements will help them gain domains (i.e Ares for example is given the domain of war because during his time he was a general on the front lines fighting along side his comrades and fought in almost every war he could) and finally Demigods can ascend to godling hood and then later godhood which would allow them to reach the upper echelons on top of that deities are ever improving and only about 8-10% of their strength comes from worship. Dionysus is the first and only demigods that successfully lives long enough to ascend. Where as multiple heroes died before they could reach it (Heracles, Achilles, Odysseus, Atlanta, Jason, Theseus, and more all were on track to but died before they could like Heracles was at most a 2 years away from ascending in which he would have been strong enough to rival the Olympians but because he was given assistance to godhood he only got about a 3rd of his would be power. Also no ship is set in stone but am thinking of Reyna x Thalia x Percy

2. This one is kinda underdeveloped but does have more directed plans. I*ncarnatio Exitium- Basically the same type of general stuff as the one before but first Percy is only the son of Poseidon and is not adopted by Artemis or favored by the domain of destruction. The first 2 books will focus on Percy's Water and Storm abilities as well as him Learning a multitude of Atlantian Techniques and Weapons. The 3rd one will probably be him unlocking Air by managing (Somehow) to connect to the Sky itself while holding it. I'll probably add a shorter story (Instead of 150,000-200,000\~ words it'll be like 80,000-100,000\~ word) in between that where it focuses on his struggles with the newly acquired attention of the Air & Sky domain. Then In the 4th book its either or. Because I could say ""Oh he unlocks them around that timeline in the original"" or I could say he finds a way to earn a minor blessing from Hephaestus which allows grants him the natural talents of Hephaestus kids and then Have him later get a blessing from Hestia where the 2 blessing combine to create a powerful flame and then before that have him instinctively perform Geokinesis to take out Hyperion using both his storms and earth abilities to win. And if I wanna go into HoO series I can have it cover the secondary ""bendings"". Also it would not follow the timeline that perfectly and I am underselling every difference to the timeline it will and does have. I'm thinking that Percy will be Asexual here and just not have a ship and will have to deal with the confusion on why he doesn't feel attraction in the way he thinks he should, but keep in mind nothing is set in stone.*

*3. This one is a very simple and VERY underdeveloped one that once again uses the same base. What if Percy was a legacy and Son of Triton making his Water and other powers weaker like his Great Grand Father is was a Son of Ares and His Grandmother was a Daughter of Hephaestus. Because of this his few powers (i.e Triton last time I checked has all the abilities of Poseidon but weaker and Then the natural talent of Ares and Hephaestus kids) and Percy like relies on Weapons like a butt ton. Like Masters every weapon/techniques he can use that doesn't require the lineage for it. And am thinking that maybe just for funs that Percy in the Sea of Monsters is ""cursed"" by Circe to be a female for all of eternity. But meh we'll see.*",4,1761245485.0,PercyJacksonfanfic,0,1.0,False

I've had feelings for her for around 3 to 4 ish months and just really wanted to tell her especially because we don't see each other often. She rejected me but in genuinly the kindest way and she still wants to be friends but it really hurts. We spent the day together and it was so enjoyable and I had so much fun. We got coffee and donuts and the whole time I just thought that I wanted it to be like this forever which sounds cringy but it was so so much fun. I don't want to come to terms with the idea that she rejected me and I get that it's an overreaction considering how nice she has been about it but I actually don't think I'll ever meet another girl ever. I'm an apprentice student so I am seperate from everyone at uni and because I work 9 to 5 when I'm not at uni I never meet anyone ever. I truly think I am going to be alone for the rest of my life and I don't want to think about that because it's so scary. And I worry I'll never actually get over her. I don't want to just cut contact with her either becuase she truly is an amazing friend and cuttung her off just because she deosn't reciprocate would feel so shallow. I truly truly hate this situation which is also stupid bc it could've ended SO much worse for me but I still feel like crying thinking about it even though I was so lucky she responded well. I just feel so hollow and she made me feel so warm and safe but I know that I will never call her mine or be able to tell her I love her or anything like that becuase at the end of the day I can't just force my feelings onto her. That would just be selfish. I've never felt like this and seriously don't know what to do. I just feel so hopeless and devoid of energy.

i was hoping to get suggestions on natural supplements that are easier on the body than prescription meds. digestive enzymes, oils, pre/probiotics?

1oebf5k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oebf5k,Rent my apartment please!,"Looking for someone to take over my apartment starting Mid-December to Jan 1 **OR:** I have someone willing to sign a 6-month lease, so a summer start is possible. This is not a sublease, you would be starting your own rental contract with the landlord.

I'm very sad to be leaving my place, but emergency circumstances are making me leave the state. It's a gorgeous first floor 2 bed 1 bath apartment with high ceilings, an open floor plan, and plenty of space and natural sunlight. Fantastic for entertaining. Pet friendly! Central air controlled by Google Nest, dishwasher, microwave, garbage disposal, washer and dryer, and a backyard. The building has a code to enter, so there's an added layer of safety and privacy. There is also some storage space underneath the stairs in a nook outside the apartment.

Very close to Murdock Park, Columbian Park, Second Flight Books, Fuel Coffee Shop, and Walgreens is a convenient 3-minute walk away. It's also about a 10-15 minute walk downtown.

The neighborhood is very quiet, and the upstairs neighbor is respectful and chill. This place would be perfect for a young family, grad students, or a crafty person with many hobbies who would turn the second bedroom into a craft room/studio/office space (like me!)

Rent is $1,300 and includes lawn care, water, and garbage services. You're responsible for electricity and internet. The landlord is very responsive and easy to work with. Please DM me if interested. Landlord is asking for 600 minimum credit score, no evictions or felonies.

Andrew was mad and blames Bree especially at the hospital scene when Andrew was mad that Bree wouldn‚Äôt take care of his dad but eventually finds out his dad was having an affair with Maisy for his sexual needs.

The scene where Bree packs Rex‚Äôs things and Andrew comes out to help her (he‚Äôs on her side for once) he calls his father a jerk for cheating on Bree. Bree then turns around and snaps.

She says to Andrew: that although she may be divorcing Rex, she may marry someone else but Rex will always be the love of her life because he had kids with her and gave her the best 18 years. And she finishes it with ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you ever speak of your father that way again.‚Äù

That part confused me a little. I‚Äôm trying to interpret Bree‚Äôs POV and real life POV. Why would Bree still call Rex the love of her life? Don‚Äôt usually when married couples divorce they have a huge resentment towards the other? Like when they are done, they are DONE. The part when she tells Andrew not to speak of his dad that way again made sense. Because divorced parents may not love eachother but they always conclude to their children that ‚Äúhe‚Äôs still your father.‚Äù

The second part, jump to season 7 when Carlos forbids Gaby from seeing Bree. The girls still meet up, have a coffee and gossip on who they cheated on. 

Bree tells her secret that she once cheated on. And Gaby was shocked she was like ‚ÄúWhat?!? You cheated on Rex?‚Äù

To which Bree replied: ‚ÄúGosh no what do you take me for? I cheated on Orson with Karl!‚Äù

That response had me questioned when she first replied in a defensive tone ‚ÄúHELL NO!‚Äù As in she didn‚Äôt cheat while married to Rex. Does she mean as in comparing her old self vs new?

Old Bree: perfect mom, wife, Christian woman who holds her values
New Bree: no husband, no younger kids to raise, no job, free to hook around.

It gave me the intention the she still loves Rex, even after when she reburied him that she was officially done with him. When his first son Sam showed up and Bree was showing him Rex‚Äôs photos and gutiar she said that when she remembers the things he liked she misses him.

What do you think? I need to get those thoughts straightened out. Especially the first scene.

Chapter 1: The Dust and Dreams of Giza

Elias Thorne‚Äôs earliest memories were not of nursery rhymes or cartoon characters, but of the musty, sweet scent of papyrus, the cool, dry touch of archaeological finds, and the hushed, reverent tones of his parents debating ancient histories. While other children learned their ABCs, Elias was absorbing the intricate beauty of hieroglyphs, his small fingers tracing the elegant curves of an ankh or the sharp lines of a hawk‚Äôs head. His home, a sprawling, comfortable house nestled in the quieter suburbs of Cairo, was less a conventional residence and more a living museum, an extension of the academic institutions where Dr. Aris Thorne and Dr. Lena Thorne spent their days unearthing the secrets of a vanished world.Aris, a man whose silvering temples betrayed years spent under the desert sun, possessed the methodical precision of a seasoned scholar and the boundless enthusiasm of a lifelong adventurer. His laughter was a warm, rumbling sound, often heard echoing through the house as he shared some newly translated epigram or a particularly amusing archaeological anecdote with Lena. Lena, with her keen, intelligent eyes and a perpetually curious expression, moved with a quiet intensity. She was the one who could spot the slightest aberration in a rock formation or discern the faded remnants of a forgotten inscription where others saw only blank stone. Together, they were a formidable duo in the field of Egyptology, respected for their innovative theories and their unwavering dedication to pushing the boundaries of conventional understanding.For Elias, this unconventional upbringing was simply life. He didn't know what it was like to have parents who worked nine-to-five jobs or who discussed mundane topics like traffic or grocery lists. His parents‚Äô conversations revolved around dynasties and deities, cartouches and catacombs, the weight of history pressing down through millennia. From the moment he could articulate thoughts, he was an active participant in their world. At five, he could identify more pharaohs than presidents. By eight, he was correcting his father‚Äôs pronunciations of Middle Egyptian phrases with a precocious confidence that Aris, though initially chagrined, secretly adored.His photographic memory was something his parents had marveled at since he was a toddler. It wasn't just rote memorization; it was an almost instantaneous absorption and understanding. He could glance at a complex archaeological diagram, a page of foreign script, or a detailed map, and recall every line, every character, every nuance with startling accuracy. They called it a gift, a blessing for a boy growing up in an academic household, and encouraged him to cultivate it, unwittingly nurturing something far more profound than simple recall.""Look, Elias,"" Lena would say, holding up a shard of pottery covered in what looked like a chaotic tangle of lines to anyone else. ""This is a fragment of a very early cursive hieratic. See if you can tell me what it says, based on what we read yesterday about early funerary texts."" Elias, barely ten, would squint at the shard, his brow furrowed in concentration, and then, after a moment of silence that felt like an eternity, he‚Äôd rattle off a nearly perfect translation, surprising even Lena. She would exchange a knowing, proud glance with Aris. He wasn't just remembering the words; he seemed to be grasping the very intent, the cultural context, the subtle emotional subtext that seasoned scholars often took years to discern. This phenomenon, which they attributed to his environment and his innate brilliance, would, in time, prove to be a faint echo of something much larger, something woven into the very fabric of his being.Their home, brimming with books and artifacts, was Elias‚Äôs sanctuary and his classroom. Stacked bookshelves lined every wall, overflowing with texts in half a dozen languages. There were dusty replicas of ancient tools, fragments of sarcophagi, and countless maps, each marked with red circles and cryptic notes. The scent of coffee and old paper was ever-present, comforting and familiar. It was a place of intellectual curiosity and boundless exploration, where the past was not dead but a vibrant, living presence.When Elias was twelve, the academic world began to buzz with rumors of a new, revolutionary find. A previously undocumented, sealed chamber had been discovered deep within the colossal structure of the Great Pyramid of Giza, accessible only through a painstakingly intricate passage. Decades of archaeological exploration had led most to believe that every secret of the ancient wonder had been unearthed, but this discovery shattered that assumption, sending ripples of excitement through the global Egyptological community. The Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities, after careful consideration, decided to grant a select few teams access, prioritizing those with a proven track record of ethical and innovative research. Among the chosen few were Dr. Aris Thorne and Dr. Lena Thorne.The weeks leading up to their departure were a flurry of activity. Their living room transformed into a chaotic command center, filled with specialized equipment, detailed architectural plans, and endless cups of lukewarm tea. Elias, now old enough to fully grasp the magnitude of the situation, felt the electrifying tension in the air. This wasn't just another dig; this was Giza. The heart of ancient Egypt, a monument that had guarded its secrets for millennia.Aris and Lena tried to temper their own excitement, maintaining their scholarly composure, but Elias could see it in their eyes‚Äîa youthful spark, a renewed vigor that reminded him of their early, adventurous photographs from his father‚Äôs college days. ""This could be nothing, Elias,"" Aris had said, adjusting his glasses, a forced casualness in his voice. ""Just another false chamber, or perhaps a storage room for tools we've already cataloged a hundred times over."" But his smile betrayed him, hinting at the profound anticipation that thrummed beneath his professional demeanor. Lena simply squeezed Elias‚Äôs hand, her gaze distant, already envisioning the mysteries that awaited them in the cool, silent depths of the pyramid.Elias had begged to join them, but the site was deemed too dangerous for a child, requiring specialized training and equipment. He had to be content with daily video calls and endless reports that filtered back, detailing the arduous process of reaching the chamber. The passage was narrow, unstable, and filled with unexpected obstacles. It took weeks of careful maneuvering, reinforcing, and navigating through unmapped sections before they finally breached the threshold.Then came the call. It was late evening in Cairo, the desert air still warm after a long day. Elias was poring over a book on astrophysical theories, a nascent interest that had recently captivated him, when the phone rang. Lena's voice, usually so composed, was breathless, almost reverent.""Elias‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre in,"" she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. ""And it's‚Ä¶ it's unlike anything we've ever seen.""The following days brought a torrent of photographs and early reports that defied everything Elias, and indeed the entire Egyptological world, thought they knew about ancient Egyptian art and knowledge. The chamber, surprisingly small and remarkably preserved, was not adorned with the typical funerary scenes, offering prayers to Osiris or depicting the journey to the afterlife. Instead, the walls of this hidden room were covered in intricate designs that seemed to vibrate with a peculiar, almost alien energy.One particular set of inscriptions stood out, captured in Lena‚Äôs high-resolution images. They depicted swirling, intertwined strands, like microscopic ropes made of light, precisely replicating the double helix structure of DNA, a concept unknown to modern science until the mid-20th century. Adjacent to these biological diagrams were complex, three-dimensional celestial maps, far more sophisticated than any known ancient astronomical charts, showing constellations and star systems that didn‚Äôt align with Earth‚Äôs sky. And woven throughout these startling visuals were symbols that defied classification ‚Äì not hieroglyphs, nor any known ancient script, but a language that felt both ancient and futuristic, imbued with a strange, almost technological precision.Aris, in his first detailed report, described them as ""anomalous glyphs depicting what appears to be advanced biological and cosmological knowledge, incongruous with the period's documented scientific understanding."" Lena, ever the one to push the theoretical boundaries, had ventured further in a private conversation with Elias. ""It's as if they possessed knowledge of genetics, Elias, centuries before the first microscope. And their stars‚Ä¶ they aren't our stars. It's like a map from another sky.""They debated endlessly over video calls, their voices a mixture of academic rigor and barely contained wonder. Aris suggested the double helix could be a stylized representation of interwoven reeds or serpents, a symbolic depiction of duality or creation. Lena countered that the precision and repetitive patterns indicated something far more literal, perhaps an abstract form of scientific illustration. Their theories, however, stumbled over the textual components. The symbols, painstakingly translated by Lena using a complex cryptographic approach she‚Äôd developed over years, spoke of concepts like ""celestial seed,"" ""genetic fusion,"" and the most intriguing of all, ""the awakening code.""""The awakening code,"" Aris mused, running a hand through his thinning hair on the video screen. ""It sounds almost‚Ä¶ technological, doesn't it? As if these inscriptions are instructions, rather than prayers.""""Or a prophecy,"" Lena added, her gaze distant. ""A trigger. The texts describe a fusion, a blending of 'star-dust with earth-clay,' meant to initiate a new lineage. It‚Äôs incredibly evocative, almost poetic, but the biological diagrams suggest a very literal interpretation.""Elias listened, captivated. He felt a strange resonance with these descriptions, a pulling sensation deep within his gut, as if the words echoed something he‚Äôd always known but never articulated. He studied the images Lena sent him, zooming in on the patterns, the seemingly chaotic yet intricately ordered lines. They looked like circuits, like data, like something beyond mere art.One evening, after another long video call, Elias found himself alone in the Thornes‚Äô study, surrounded by the printouts Lena had sent. He picked up one of the high-resolution photographs of the Giza chamber wall, focusing on the large, central inscription identified as the ""Awakening Code."" It was a sprawling, circular design, almost mandala-like, composed of interconnected loops and symbols, some of which were clearly the double helix pattern. He traced its lines with his finger, feeling the smooth, glossy paper. As his fingertip brushed over a specific cluster of interwoven symbols‚Äîa section that Aris had dismissed as ""mere ornamentation""‚Äîa faint, almost imperceptible hum resonated through the paper. It was a vibration, subtle and fleeting, like a distant tuning fork, that seemed to emanate directly from the image itself.Elias froze, his heart skipping a beat. He lifted his finger, the hum ceased. He pressed down again, and there it was, faint but distinct, a low, resonant frequency that seemed to vibrate not just in his finger, but deep within his chest. He tried it repeatedly, moving his finger across other parts of the inscription. Nothing. Only that one specific cluster of symbols produced the sensation. It was a peculiar, unexplainable phenomenon, a tactile response to a photograph.He pulled his hand away, a shiver running down his spine. His logical mind, nurtured by his scientific parents, immediately sought an explanation. Static electricity? A trick of the light? A consequence of over-caffeination? Yet, the sensation lingered, a faint echo in his fingertips, a persistent question mark in his mind. He didn't mention it to his parents. They were busy with their groundbreaking discovery, dissecting every symbol with scholarly rigor. This fleeting, personal experience felt too strange, too‚Ä¶ inexplicable. He filed it away as an oddity, an anomaly, unaware that it was merely the first whisper of a much louder symphony, a direct, intimate resonance with a truth that was, in fact, his own.The Thornes, immersed in their meticulous documentation and translation efforts, remained blissfully unaware of the subtle, profound connection their adopted son had forged with the very ancient secrets they were painstakingly unearthing. They continued to theorize about a lost civilization, about symbolic representations, about humanity's innate drive to understand the cosmos. They marveled at the precocious Elias, his quick grasp of complex concepts, his innate understanding of the world. They saw a brilliant child shaped by their love and their profession. They saw everything but the living, breathing manifestation of the very anomaly they were studying. The Giza chamber had yielded its first great secret, but it was not merely a historical revelation; it was a prelude to a personal truth that would redefine everything they thought they knew about their family, about humanity, and about Elias himself. The dust of millennia had settled, but the whispers of a far older, cosmic truth were only just beginning to stir.

My partner (‚ÄúSam‚Äù) offered to DM a special DnD game for me and our friends at a cabin for my birthday weekend. She'd had several years of DM experience, I'd played for 2 years, and our 6 friends (including my now ex-best friend ""Greg"") were newbies. This would be the first time playing for 2 of them. There were big personalities at the table, but everyone agreed to come to the table with open minds, patience, a willingness to learn, and a promise to remember **it's just a game.** Unfortunately for everyone, especially my partner, Greg wouldn't keep this promise. I should've seen that coming.¬†

**Necessary backstory:** One year prior, I had begun learning to DM from Sam and, for my first time running a game, I invited Greg and his partner to play a one-shot, in which Sam would also be playing. I explained how it was meant to be a ""practice game"" to help me be a better DM and also to teach them the basics of playing. They agreed enthusiastically and said they were fine with the fact that I had asked Sam to occasionally help me along the way if I needed advice or reminders of game specifics. I put my heart and soul into being a good DM, but I soon realized that Greg wasn't yet grasping the dynamics of a TTRPG: he was pre-rolling, talking over other players, meta-gaming, taking extra actions, declaring the outcomes of his and other characters without the DM's input, debating the DM‚Äôs rulings, basically side-seat DMing with more than a little MCS (main character syndrome). Not to mention the litigating; he would keep track of everything I would allow to happen for the other players, then use that as evidence to leverage extra turns, more loot, etc, for his character. All of this felt typical of a new player, so I my rose-colored glasses missed the big red flags.

At the end of part 1, we all talked about how the game went, and to his credit, Greg was open to feedback. I clarified that DnD isn't about ""player vs DM""; it's a collaborative story. I made sure everyone felt heard and answered all the questions, and we all agreed to work harder to make part 2 even better.

Part 2 came around; things started well but ended poorly. Greg was getting frustrated at some poor rolls, still talked over people, more meta-gaming, made fun of other players' choices, and continued ""keeping score"" of the other characters' experiences. I would still occasionally lean over to Sam to ask for clarification on certain things (again, this was a one-shot to practice my DM skills, and my ADHD made checking the DMG difficult). Greg must have been silently resenting this because right at the climax of the BBEG fight, I asked Sam for a reminder on which dice to roll for damage, and when she answered, Greg shouted, ""SAM! Stop helping the bad guy!"" He tried to laugh it off, but the table went silent for a solid 10 seconds. Sam was visibly shaken, as she had a history of abusive men in her life, and here was this guy twice her size shouting at her to be quiet. She shrank into her seat and stayed quiet for the remainder of the game. I still feel terrible that I let this happen and that I didn‚Äôt stop the game right then to address it. I tried to wrap up the game quickly, and then we awkwardly packed up and left. Sam was really upset and cried the whole way home. She couldn't play or DM for months afterward. I confronted Greg about it, and he expressed more confusion than remorse (red flag). Months later, when she felt ready, Sam agreed to meet with Greg to discuss it. Though he never said ""I'm sorry"" (another overlooked red flag), his position was basically ""the incident was unfortunate"". It took some time, but eventually, Sam felt safe enough to return to playing & DMing TTRPGs.¬†

End of backstory. I digress back to the birthday game.¬†

Sam worked for weeks leading up to my birthday, checking in with all the players in hopes of making it a fun, low-stakes game for everyone. The day came, and she did a great preamble about inclusion, lines & veils, player etiquette, etc, and reinforced that this should be a safe place for everyone to ask questions and have fun.

It was a one-shot module, and we were all excited to start. Unfortunately, with mostly new players, it quickly went from a stealthy mission to a clunky smash-and-grab we were all laughing about. Sam's best friend (‚ÄúJune‚Äù) was there, and thank goodness she was. June was made aware of Greg's past behavior, so she and I worked together to be extra supportive players to help Sam feel safe to be the amazing DM she is.

While the majority of the game was fun and hilarious, Greg's turns started to become more annoying. It started when he added a last-minute homebrewed feat to his lvl 4 monk: magic eyes that would auto-hypnotize anyone into doing his bidding (basically the wizard ability Hypnotic Gaze). Sam explained how this magical ability was a bit OP, and Greg‚Äôs argument was essentially ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs okay, because it makes him colorblind‚Äù. Sam, wanting to help everyone have fun, met him halfway, saying she would allow it, but it would cost an action, and he'd have to roll to see if it succeeded. Greg, visibility begrudged, agreed.¬†

Throughout the night if Greg wasn‚Äôt on his phone ignoring the gameplay, he would be making fun of other players‚Äô choices; he interrupted the DM and other players more than anyone else at the table, and when he was called out on it, he‚Äôd respond with something like ‚ÄúOh, finish what you were saying, I‚Äôll allow it.‚Äù; whenever he got bored during someone else‚Äôs turn (often) he would start a countdown timer on his phone and hold it up in front of whoever was taking their turn, and then take even longer time on his turns, which he mostly spent meta-gaming and giving orders to the other players on what they need to do to support his plans. Whenever a player would call him out for meta-gaming he would respond with ""I don't know what meta-gaming is"" (obvious lie) or the classic ""It's what my character would do"".¬†

Soon it was almost midnight, we had imbibed a few drinks, and everyone was on the edge of tipsy. Sam made sure to check in with the players on how we were feeling, if we needed bio-breaks, or if we were bored and wanted to cut the game short. Everyone said they were having a great time, so we continued. This brings us to the finale.

The end of the game came when our party got caught. Truthfully, it was hilariously botched from the beginning. We had failed the mission, and the BBEG had cornered us with their entire guard force. We were clearly outgunned, and Sam didn't want us to have a TPK, so the BBEG offered us a consolation prize: Gloves of Thievery for each of us, and they would let us live to try again in the future. Everyone at the table was disappointed, but we were all resigned to accepting the gloves with the agreement that the game was still fun! Everyone except Greg, whose monk attempted to melee his way through a platoon of high-level sorcerers & veterans with great swords. Sam pulled the NPC‚Äôs punches, and even allowed him a few extra reactions, but Greg's character was still getting pummeled, so she paused the game and gently told us that, despite our efforts, there was no chance of fighting our way out alive. Again, the table verbally agreed this was the end, and everyone started to gather up their dice and trays, thanking Sam for a fun game, and recalling hilarious moments in the session.

Greg, however, began to sweat and tremble, and he glared daggers at Sam. He raised his voice and began accusing Sam of being unfair, claiming, ""Isn't it weird that she ended the game when it was *my* turn?"" When we tried to answer him, he would shout back, ""NO! NO! Stop interrupting me!"" (we weren‚Äôt). He was convinced Sam was blaming him entirely for the mission‚Äôs failure and kept repeating how he was being targeted. Everyone at the table spoke up, saying how that was not the case, but Greg had decided this would be the hill he would die on. He ranted about how he was a great person for sitting through an entire evening of gaming without complaining (no one forced him to play), how he had been the most considerate player at the table because he didn‚Äôt interrupt anyone (not true), and started listing things other players had done throughout the game retroactively declaring them unfair and therefore justified his feelings. All of this was aimed at Sam.

June & I positioned ourselves beside Sam and defended her at every turn. June stepped up and called Greg out on his increasingly toxic behavior throughout the game; I was trying to halt his diatribe with things like ‚ÄúStop, we‚Äôre done, the game‚Äôs over, let‚Äôs table this and address it tomorrow‚Äù, and he would just ignore all of it. He was going full self-victimizing douchebag and refused to listen. At one point, because I declined to unequivocally side with him, Greg jumped backwards saying, ‚ÄúI have to back up or I‚Äôm going to do something I‚Äôll regret.‚Äù A super obvious threat of physical violence right there.¬†

Sam, having spent months processing and growing from the last time this happened, stood up to Greg and didn‚Äôt let him bully her, nor let him goad her into anger. She gave him time to speak, then rebutted in the kindest, firmest way that would make the best HR department envious. She was offering apologies, saying she didn‚Äôt mean to make it a bad time (we kept assuring her it wasn‚Äôt), and then she began to cry. Naturally, we all came to her side and started comforting her, but Greg seized this chance to go into his final narcissistic form and went full[ DARVO](https://www.domesticshelters.org/articles/identifying-abuse/explaining-darvo-deny-attack-reverse-victim-amp-offender). He raised his voice to get the group‚Äôs attention: ‚ÄúWAIT, WAIT, STOP, EVERYONE, LISTEN. Listen‚Ä¶ you all need to remember that just because she‚Äôs crying doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs right, so you shouldn‚Äôt take that into account.‚Äù¬† We were all agape at the audacity. Not only was he being a complete asshole who made my partner cry, but he basically told everyone to ignore her.

The entire group was done with Greg‚Äôs bullsh\*t. Sam made one last attempt to bridge the gap, but Greg picked up his phone and walked away.¬†

June and I took Sam on a long walk to get her away from the whole situation. When we got back to the cabin, Greg was doing a classic narcissist move after a fight by loudly talking and laughing as if nothing had happened. June and I made sure he didn‚Äôt get anywhere near Sam, and I tucked her into bed, though neither of us slept that night.¬†

The next morning, everyone was packing up, preparing to leave. Sam remained in our room until it was clear for her to get to our car without being near Greg. I brought her juice and coffee, and I would go out occasionally to pack up the supplies we brought. One might think that Greg‚Äôs behavior was a result of alcohol, but he was sober in the morning, and what he did next was inexcusable.

In the last few minutes, we were all about to leave when Greg asked me to come into the other room to talk. I was hesitant, but I went in expecting him to offer some kind of apology, or ask, ‚ÄúIs Sam okay?‚Äù. Nope. He made it all about himself: ‚ÄúSomething about me triggers Sam, and I have no idea why. I have no clue why she targeted me last night, but I ***need*** to know.‚Äù He started shaking. His hands were clenched into trembling fists, and his eyes were wide and tense. He offered no apology whatsoever. He didn‚Äôt ask about Sam‚Äôs well-being at all. All he talked about was that something about him triggers Sam, he doesn‚Äôt know what it is, but he ***NEEDED*** to know.

This was the narcissist laid bare. You can‚Äôt argue, debate, or converse at all with a narcissist. They win the moment you engage with them. If you give them something to latch onto, they‚Äôll dissect it, flip it, and use it to litigate themselves into being ‚Äúthe real victim‚Äù regardless of what it is or what they‚Äôve done. They *need* something, *anything*, to sink their teeth into. And Greg had nothing. He knew he was the bad guy, and we all had witnessed it. We saw his true colors, and he had nothing to manipulate his way out of it. So he needed me to say something so he could use my words for his means.

I realized that if I told him what he did, if I said anything about why Sam was upset, he would manipulate it into whatever narrative he would tell the other guests. This is why he asked me into a one-on-one conversation away from everyone else. When I realized this, I stopped myself from giving him anything. I only told him I wasn‚Äôt going to speak for Sam, and nor would I talk about it in that moment. His entire body shook, and his face tensed up, but he accepted it.

Sam and I drove home talking through what had happened. I‚Äôm so grateful June had been there, because we were able to give Sam the space, support, time, and love she needed to move past it. And since that weekend, she has done just that. The weekend wasn‚Äôt a complete loss, either; the time before the game was filled with music, movies, cooking, and cake! She had given me a great birthday, and nothing will stop me from remembering all the effort she put into making it fun.

I wrote a letter to Greg, calling him out for his horrible behavior and cutting all ties with him. Good riddance. Since then, Sam has recovered; we both still frequently play D&D, and life has gotten so much better since I cut Greg out of my life! Sam has even started teaching me how to DM!",4,1761244504.0,dndhorrorstories,3,0.67,False

On 1/14/26 I‚Äôll be 3 years sober, but for 17 years prior to that I was a heavily addicted ‚Äúfunctioning‚Äù opioid addict. It started with being prescribed Percocet after injuring my spine in a snowboarding competition. 

Then came the OxyContin epidemic. Then OC became a nightmare to find so I switched to Heroin. By the time H could barely keep me out of physical withdrawals for 2-3 hours, I switched to Fentanyl. The amount of Fent I‚Äôd do daily just to be able to work (not high at all, just not physically sick) would shock most people. 

On an average day I‚Äôd snort and smoke roughly 30-50 pressed Fent 30mgs (the blue pressed M boxes). Towards the end I‚Äôd have to use before going to bed, then wake up every night drenched in sweat but shivering because of the withdrawal, so I‚Äôd use to fall back asleep, then my alarm for work goes off and I‚Äôm already starting to withdrawal again, so I‚Äôd smoke and snort 3-4 more prior to making coffee and getting ready for work.

Eventually it took 4 ODs before I committed myself to a 90 day in patient rehab. The 4th/final OD I don‚Äôt remember, but I do vividly remember waking up in the ER with all of my ribs broken from the paramedics doing chest compressions because Narcan wasn‚Äôt bringing me back. After completing rehab I tapered myself off Suboxone, and I still go to weekly NA meetings.

Currently my friend is trying to ‚Äúcut back on smoking weed‚Äù, and really finding it difficult. He knows about my recovery journey, and on numerous times he has made remarks about how he ‚Äútotally can relate‚Äù to what I went through; along with many other comments about how he ‚Äúhas so much more respect for me now‚Äù etc etc.

I haven‚Äôt shared these thoughts with him yet, but his remarks to me, and struggles with him cutting back on smoking weed are making me lose respect for him.

Or so I thought.

Gritted teeth, awkward vibes, then radio silence.

The latest? I message her on FB (dumb move, I know ‚Äì was quitting the app, wanted one last casual chat): ""Where you headed on vacation next?"" Her reply? ""Do you want to sleep in my daughter's bed?"" ?? I hit back with ""??"", waited for the decode... crickets. Deleted FB and ghosted.

It's the same script every time: Vague bait that stirs the ""what if?"" pot, fishes for a reaction (does he still care? Bite?), then dips when it risks real talk. She's hopped through marriages (quick Vegas one ended in assault charges), a lesbian phase (cohab that fizzled fast), bankruptcies, house-hops ‚Äì now 4-5 years shacked up unmarried with a man, posting PDA peeks where she's half-hiding behind the door like ""look what you're missing.""

I know her game now: Not ""come back to me,"" but ego-soothe ‚Äì my steady ""pre-chaos"" vibe as the safe echo to quiet her static for a sec. But why me after 30 years? Why the kid's bed proxy instead of ""screw you"" or ""let's grab coffee""? Am I reading too deep, or is this her way of saying ""I won the split""?

Tired of the loop. No-contact's the move, but damn if it doesn't ping the ""what if?"" How do you mute a 30-year glitch? Who's got the hack?

1oeb4vc,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1oeb4vc/postcards_cabinetasheboro_nc/,"Postcards Cabinet-Asheboro, NC","Get ready‚Ä¶This is a long one, but it is positive with some recommendations when staying at a Postcard cabin. I read a lot before our stay and I thought it would be helpful for others to get some tips from what we figured out when we were there. Before I start, we absolutely loved it! We took our two dogs-one is a terrier and one is a Chihuahua mix. A big dog would be tough. We stayed in Asheboro, North Carolina. We chose that one because it‚Äôs drivable for us.

-Check in: They tell you in the confirmation email that you‚Äôll get information via text in the ‚Äúearly to mid‚Äù afternoon on day of check in. We got our text 1 hour before check-in. Make sure you check that your correct cell phone is in your Marriott profile. They text you complete instructions of what cabin you‚Äôre in and how to enter with a code. I found them to be extremely responsive. The only thing is you don‚Äôt know how to contact them directly until they have initially contacted you.

-Food & drink: The fridge is small, but adequate. No ice.  We brought sandwich makings, eggs, veggies, protein bars, chips, humus, pita, apples & caramel dip and creamer. The coffee is pour over and it wasn‚Äôt bad. They have the yucky little creamers. We brought our own to keep in fridge. There is plenty of sugar, salt and pepper. There is a stove top and pots/pans/utensils/cups. No microwave. Bring chip clips for bags. 
-Bathroom: No sink. I brushed my teeth in the shower. My husband used the kitchen sink and I screamed at him that he was a pig. He then used the shower. The shower got hot and wasn‚Äôt too bad. The towels are typical crappy hotel towels. 
-Bed: Very comfortable. We brought an extra comforter and pillows which was easy to do since we drove. I would suggest asking for an extra comforter, if you cannot bring your own. We loved having the huge window next to the bed that overlooked the pond.
-A/C/Heat: It works, but it is loud because the space is so small. It blows right towards the table. We didn‚Äôt have to use it that much. We just tried it out.
-Fire: This was our favorite. Two Adirondack  chairs in front of the fire pit. There is a box that has all the fire supplies. I had picked up some fire starter before going and they did have some in this box as well. We had to gather kindling, and we got everything going right away. You also get little s‚Äômores kits. A lot of people were complaining online that they didn‚Äôt give you sticks for it. They are on the counter right behind where all the snacks are. We brought one of those Bic lighter contraptions and I‚Äôm glad we did. They have two of them there, but they didn‚Äôt work so great. There is also a fire extinguisher in one of those fire blankets if your fire gets out of control!
-‚ÄúDestination fee‚Äù: You get coffee, bottled water, little creamers, bags of snacks, oatmeal, tea and hot chocolate packets. They come daily to refill what you‚Äôve used. I suggest taking them all with you because you paid for it! No housekeeping, but you don‚Äôt need it. 
-Storage: The bed had space underneath where you could slide your backpack and shoes. 
-Clothes: Just use a backpack. I brought jeans, hiking boots, long sleeve tee, sweater, and a thin jacket. This was in October. I‚Äôm a girly girl, but I didn‚Äôt bring make-up. Just something for my lips. It would be a hassle getting ready because the bathroom is so small. There is a little mirror inside one of the kitchen cabinets.
-Outdoors: We brought bug spray, but didn‚Äôt need it. We were next to the pond and I imagine in the summer there are mosquitoes. There is an outdoor light on the cabin, but we were thankful that we remembered to bring flashlights. This property is 32 acres and has 31 cabins. They were closer to each other than I anticipated but we had a lot of privacy. We went during the week and there were very few people there. You can hear a bit of road noise. Of course that will vary by the location. The next one we want to try is Shenandoah.
-Communication: No WIFI and we did fine. I really needed to decompress. My husband and I both have AT&T wireless and we got a decent signal. We streamed a movie and had no buffering.
-Bring something you like to sip on! We brought a bottle of Woodford.

There are several posts that people are not happy since Marriott purchased these properties. This was our first experience and we loved it. The destination fee is stupid. They should just have that as part of the rate. We paid $127 a night before the $40/nightly destination fee. Again this was on a weekday.

I use talk to text if I sound like a dummy. I hope this is helpful.

I often borrow people money, I rarely get it back, I have borrowed less than ¬£100 in my lifetime & every time I have ever paid someone back (twice in my life since I was 17) I've always told me exactly when I will have it & have stayed true to my word on the two occasions I did

Someone recently owed me money & decided to lend someone else money WHILE they owed me money, the money they lend way 3X the amount they owed me!, they gave this person all their money so I had to lend them even more money

But the kicker is you can make it one of those mugs that changes when you put in hot liquid.

So ""the ends justify the leans"" can appear when I pour in some coffee.

I purchased an older Breville Smart Grinder (800xl, I believe) plus a Breville Bambino over the weekend and all I am getting is watery shots/sludgy pucks. My shots are quite sour as well. I didn‚Äôt realize this is an old model of this grinder with seemingly limited settings. 

I‚Äôm reading that I likely need to grind finer, but I don‚Äôt know if I can make it any finer with this grinder. The only way I know how to tighten it up is with the dial on the side. The burrs don‚Äôt seem to be adjustable. 

Another issue I am having is a lot of spray out of the group head when it is pouring. I am using a bottomless portafilter, 18g of coffee (comes out as 60g (!?), tamping, and using a puck screen.

I'm a bartender and get off usually between 1-2, get home between 2-3.  It takes me a half hour to crash, so going to sleep between 230-330am.  I'm at by 630 to get up and get my sons ready for school.  

I'm a wreck the whole day.  I'm starting this regimen as soon as my protein powder and psyllium is delivered Saturday.

My days off are Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday.  I feel like Friday and Saturday should be rest days, but then I'm short changing my sons by not going out and doing things with them

Constructive advice is welcome!

Edit: I'm 6'2"" and 230 pounds, a lot of that is gut.  I'm decently small boned, so 235 is way too much for my natural frame.  

Also, this isn't a woe is me post.  In March 2024, I lost 25lbs doing a modified carnivore diet with intermittent fasting.  It legit worked for me and I stuck to it.  Eggs with jalape√±os around 9.  A ribeye steak (usually 6 ounces) finished with unsalted Irish butter, an over medium egg on top, with 3 spears of asparagus.  I only drank water, ice tea with lemon, and coffee with an ounce of heavy cream. My fast time was 5 on, 19 off, the first week was HELL. I moved from 5 minutes from work to over an hour away for financial reasons.  Because of my travel time, and with how extremely tired I am (I literally feel like I save up all my energy for a busy work shift), I just can't keep up with that fast.  Not to mention when I get off between 2-3, I'm STARVING.  It was one thing to drive five minutes home, have a glass of water with lemon and go to bed.  With an hour plus drive, I need something to keep me awake.

Any advice is appreciated! I'm tired of being tired!",2,1761243603.0,loseit,4,1.0,False

I'm going for a warm cozy vibe, suitable for both work and relaxation (gaming, boardgames, music). I can't quite figure out how to fit things. I need my work desk in the living room because I don't want to work in the bedroom. Most likely I'll have to move the piano into the bedroom because I want to make space for a TV and TV cabinet/shelves. I'm not particularly attached to the side cabinet, it can go, but I need something similar to charge my phone at and store wallet/keys/etc. I'm planning to DIY the recessed bookshelf to make it look nicer. I'd like to keep the coffee table because it folds out into a boardgaming table and is great value for money and doesn't look too bad IMO.

Can you guys help suggest how to position things, what to take out, what to put in? I made a layout diagram in Excalidraw - space dimensions are roughly 4.5m x 3.6m. There's a lot of potential here, I know it! It's just tricky making things work when two sides of the room are unusable - one is a large window with space heater, the opposite side is a passthrough area.

1oeaqtt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SuperiorPromos/comments/1oeaqtt/the_classic_promo_that_still_works_11_oz_white/,The Classic Promo That Still Works: 11 oz White Ceramic Mug,"If you‚Äôre looking for a branded giveaway that people actually keep and use daily, the **11 oz white ceramic mug** is tough to beat. It‚Äôs timeless, affordable at scale, prints beautifully, and turns every coffee break into a mini billboard for your brand. Here‚Äôs why this staple continues to deliver big impressions for a small budget‚Äîand how to get the most from your next mug order.

# Why marketers still love the 11 oz ceramic mug

**1) Everyday visibility**  
Mugs live on desks, in office kitchens, and at home‚Äîmeaning your logo stays in sight for months (even years). Unlike swag that gets tossed, a good mug becomes part of a routine.

**2) Clean canvas for crisp branding**  
The glossy white surface makes colors pop. Whether you choose a one-color imprint or a full-color design, detail and readability stay strong.

**3) Budget-friendly at volume**  
Unit cost drops quickly in bulk, which makes mugs perfect for onboarding kits, customer thank-yous, trade shows, fundraisers, and retail resale.

**4) Durable, practical, giftable**  
Ceramic feels substantial in hand, and the 11 oz size fits standard brewers and desk spaces. Add a bag of coffee or cocoa for an instant gift set.

# Smart use cases (with quick ideas)

* **New-hire kits:** print your logo on one side and core values or a QR onboarding link on the other.
* **Customer retention:** pair with a handwritten note and a sample pack‚Äîship in Q4 for holiday goodwill.
* **Events & trade shows:** offer a ‚Äúcoffee on us‚Äù voucher tucked inside the mug to drive booth traffic.
* **Donor/parent appreciation:** personalizable fields (name/class/department) boost perceived value.
* **Retail & campus stores:** simple typographic designs or local pride sayings sell year-round.

# Design tips for a better print

* **Prioritize contrast.** Dark logos (black/navy/forest) read best on white. If your logo is light, add a dark outline or colored background panel.
* **Mind the imprint area.** Keep small copy ‚â•8 pt for one-color, ‚â•7 pt for full-color; avoid hairline strokes under 1 pt.
* **Use vector art.** Send AI/EPS/PDF with fonts outlined for the sharpest result.
* **Consider 2-sided or wrap prints.** Put the logo facing both right- and left-handed drinkers, or add a tagline/URL opposite the logo.
* **Keep it simple.** Minimal designs look premium on a white mug and are faster to approve.

# Production & timing

Most mug orders move fast once art is approved. Standard production is typically a few business days, with rush options available during non-peak periods. If you‚Äôve got a hard event date, tell us early‚Äîwe‚Äôll help you pick the right print method and shipping speed to hit your in-hand goal.

# Packaging ideas that elevate the experience

* **Individually boxed** with tissue and a ‚Äúthanks for being awesome‚Äù card.
* **Bundle** with coffee, tea, or hot cocoa.
* **Seasonal stickers** on the box for holidays or donor drives.

# Care & durability

* Hand-washing helps preserve print vibrancy longest, though many customers use these in the dishwasher without issue. Avoid abrasive scrubbers on the imprint area.

# Why order from Superior Promos

* **Quality prints**‚Äîclean, centered, and consistent across large runs.
* **Friendly rush help**‚Äîwe‚Äôre pros at tight timelines and clear proofs.
* **Bulk pricing**‚Äîtransparent quotes and layout previews before you approve.

I am new to this community and would be forever grateful for your advice on my temporary base camp setup. 

We‚Äôre building a little stone house in North East Spain and living from a Caravan. 

While 2x 440w panels worked great in the summer, even Spain needs more real estate for proper electricity in winter.

I have all parts and want to wire the following:
1. String: 500w - 440w - 440w
2. String: 500w - 500w
3. String: 500w - 500w

‚Äî> all go to a fuse box with master on/off that combines them into two 6mm cables going to my BLUETTI AC200L that acts as inverter and night storage. 

The BLUETTI has a maximum solar input voltage of 145v. I‚Äôm assuming that the 120ish volts of the three panel string marks the maximum it will get so should be fine.

While the overall grid could obviously produce more than the 15 A that the BLUETTI can use I understand that the surplus current will simply be clipped. 

Does all of this sound correct or do you see a blatant error?

Thanks again for your help! If you‚Äôre ever in the region, I‚Äôll make you a coffee or drink (or tea?!).",2,1761243262.0,SolarDIY,6,1.0,False
