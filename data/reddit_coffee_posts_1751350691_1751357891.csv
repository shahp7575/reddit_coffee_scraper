I looked at the clock on my bedroom wall. I think I have delayed the inevitable for as long as I physically can. I should go to the packhouse to go and wish our pack's upcoming Alpha a happy birthday. The bane of my life. My brother’s best friend. One day to be Alpha Miles. Today he will turn 17, and meet his Alpha wolf. In all honesty, he was egotistical enough, thinking the world revolved around him, without him adding to that by finally gaining his wolf. Not your run-of-the-mill werewolf either. Oh no, Miles Davenport was destined to be an Alpha, so he would have a strong and powerful Alpha wolf, only adding to his arrogance and strength.

The crazy thing is, Miles had once upon a time been one of my closet friends too. In my younger childhood... Friends, that kind of thing comes when your father is the Beta to the Alpha. The children spend a lot of time together, and become friends. My older brother, Jordan, became the wing-man to Miles. His closest friend and ally, who as his Beta when the time came, was only right. But as the years went on, the friendship between Miles and I changed.

Friendship faded as he grew into a more popular sports star of our school. At the end of the day, he was always going to be popular, he was the upcoming Alpha after all, but as one of the top sports stars too, he was idolized. As was my brother. All the girls in school flocked around them like they were pop stars or something, and it was bizarre. I was nothing more to him now but a source of amusement for him and his sports buddies. A geek. Not one of the beauty queens who followed him around. Simply someone to make fun of.

I had gone from enjoying time with my one-day Alpha, to hating him, in the space of a school year. He thought he was god’s gift, and in all honesty, if he was, he is a gift I would return…

“Bailey!” I heard my Mum call from downstairs, telling me I was definitely running it close now for time. I know Jordan had already headed over to the packhouse a while ago with my Dad to meet his friend and our Alpha.

“I know.” I yelled back, looking at the books on my desk, desperate to continue with the assignment I was working on. I would so much rather continue working on the assignment and gain the additional credit available, work toward going to the college I want to go to instead of going to a party for the big-headed bully, I got to consider almost family, considering he was the son of my Dad’s best friend.

I stood from my seat, and walked to my mirror, adjusting my black skater dress I had chosen to wear today. Something plain and simple, easy to blend into the background, but a dress all the same if anyone asked why I hadn’t made an effort. Along with my chunky black sandals, I looked presentable, not that anyone would be looking at me. Today, all eyes would be on the birthday boy, as they always were. He would make sure of that. I flicked back my curly brown hair, before I walked out of the door, already dreading the hours that lay ahead…

My Mum pulled the car into the parking spaces outside the packhouse, while my younger sister Morgan was flicking at the curls around my head, simply trying to irritate me. She knew I would rather be anywhere but here right now, and was loving every last moment of it. “Aww, you want to go home Bailey-boo?” she teased.

“Stop you two, come on, your Dad is waiting inside. Let us go and find the birthday boy.” Mum says, sounding cheerful, completely oblivious to the fact how horrendous this party had the potential to be. She, too, worshiped Miles. Having seen him grow up alongside my brother, she seemed to think the sun shone out of his rear-end. It had always driven me insane.

“He won’t even notice us there.” I muttered under my breath as I followed her up the steps of the back house, shaking my head at my sister and how overdressed she looked. She definitely looked like she was out to impress someone today. A small part of me wondered if she hoped she might be the fated mate of Miles. After all, he was meeting his Alpha wolf today. He will have shifted for the first time today, and today could potentially be the day he can sense his fated mate out there waiting for him! There had been so much buzz around school about this, so many of the girls were excited about the potential possibility they could be his fated mate. The one chosen for him by the moon goddess. The one destined to be with him. So many of them are desperate for it to be them. While there I was desperate for anything but. I could think of nothing worse! Yet, looking at the amount of effort my younger sister had made today, I am beginning to think she was one of the many she-wolves that was holding out that hope…

We walked through the corridors of the packhouse, and it was filled with various pack members. Today was a day of celebration within pack, the birthday of the upcoming Alpha. And not just any birthday, the day he came of age. The day he met his Alpha wolf. The walls of the packhouse were adorned with decorations, music was blaring from various speakers dotted around the multiple rooms.

“Ooff, sorry!” a giggling she-wolf said to me as she nearly knocked me off my feet as she knocked into me. I would rather be anywhere but here right now. This was far too hectic and far too loud for me. I simply glare at the back of the girl as she moves away from me, not a care in the world.

I followed my Mum and my sister, who was almost skipping as she walked, toward the main lounge area. I can only assume my Mum had mindlinked my Dad to let him know we had arrived, and he said they were there, or else we could spend all day looking around for them! It appeared almost every member of the pack had turned up to celebrate the birthday of Miles fucking Davenport.

The lounge area was laden with people, music truly blasting, and everyone seeming to have a good time. Everyone but me. I caught the eye of my brother, leaning against the wall of the lounge, the furthest away from the door we had just walked into. He nodded in my direction before simply turning away.

‘Could have made an effort, Bailey.’ he mindlinked. ‘It is a birthday, not a funeral, you know?’

I felt my heart sink at his words. Great, the insults were starting already, which meant it would only be a matter of time until Miles started too. The two of them seemed to like working together like that. Finding great enjoyment in harassing me. I was only a year younger than both of them, and had desperately hoped the name-calling and insulting would ease off as they got a little older, but if anything, they seemed to get worse. All because I wasn’t like the girls they were interested in, I was sure of it. I wasn’t like the other girls. Made myself an easy target, my Mum told me, all because I enjoyed studying. Liked reading and learning. Said, I only made it harder for myself. The plan was to make it easier for myself by finding a way out…

“Jordan says your dress looks like you are going to a funeral, Bailey.” Morgan teased, fluffing up my curls again. My long brown hair fell in thick, unruly curls down my back. They drove me mad at times. Especially when my brother and sister decide to mess with them.

“Oh well, I wore a dress, like you asked.” I snapped, moving away from them, feeling angry already, so tempted just to turn around and walk home, only to be pulled back by my Mum.

“We are going to wish Miles a happy birthday. You will stay for a while at least. I do not need to be explaining to your Aunt and Uncle yet again why you have walked out on a social event, Bailey.” Mum warned me, her tone sounding grumpy, I swear she had to have read my thoughts on leaving the party already. I am sure she hated having me as a daughter, likely wishing for one that was more sociable, and one that enjoyed being a part of everything, instead of one that would rather have her head in a book.

“Awww, Happy Birthday, Miles!” I heard my sister squeal from by my side. I swear she spoke at a pitch so high only dogs could hear. Goddess knows why she is so excited. It is only his birthday. He likely doesn’t even care, he never normally does…

As I looked up, his blue eyes were locked on me, I raised my gaze to meet his, and could see his eyes shift to a darker blue… was that his wolf? I see a snarl across his face as he suddenly storms from the room. What the hell was that about?

‘Get out here.’ Miles is suddenly mindlinking me, and I have to say he sounded far from impressed. That, combined with the angry expression on his face, told me something was off. Would he have rather I had not come? Well, he was not the only one…

‘What?’ I questioned, completely confused. Was he annoyed over how I had dressed too? Jeez, it was just a dress. Does it really matter? I would go home if it was.

‘Outside now.’ He demanded once more, sounding even more irritated this time, making me realize I had little choice but to follow his orders, so I snuck away from the ongoing party back to the doors of the packhouse.

Only to find Miles pacing along the bottom of the steps, looking a mixture of confused and angry. So why did he need me here? Someone to take his anger out on? I was not willing to be that, I was sure about that… Just as I was about to walk away, he looked up.

“Fucking took you long enough.” He snapped.

I frowned, unsure what this was all about, but it was making no sense to me as I looked down toward him from where I stood at the top of the packhouse steps. His blue eyes shifted to the dark blue once more, like they had inside, taking me by surprise. His wolf is clearly lingering…

“What is wrong, Miles? Do you want me to get Jordan?” I asked.

“No I do not! I do not want anyone knowing this.” He snarls, a growl slipping from his lips, though whether that was aimed at me or whether his wolf was angry at him, I do not know…

“I don’t think I understand…” I began.

“You soon will.” He sneers, and I simply look to him in confusion. Nothing he says makes sense to me. Until he continues. “Only today did I realize. The thought makes me sick. Why our own moon goddess would play a trick like this on me, I don’t know. I am an Alpha. A fucking Alpha. I deserve a strong mate. A beautiful mate to be proud of. Not some feeble pathetic wallflower.”

My body trembles at his words. No. I had yet to gain my wolf. I did not know this yet. Why… Why him of all people? “I am your fated mate?” I question with a shaky voice. “Are you sure?”

“Are you fucking doubting me?” he yells. “And you won’t be. The moment you have your wolf, I will decide when the time is right to reject you.”

My heart twists and contorts at the thought. Rejection was meant to be the most painful thing possible. Why would he want to reject the mate chosen for him by our own moon goddess? Am I truly so repulsive?

# Chapter 2 Bailey

A Year Later

Yet another birthday party for our beloved upcoming Alpha. Ha. Not my beloved upcoming Alpha. I hated the fucker. Breaking my heart without a second thought. What I had done to deserve that I had never got a proper explanation from him. Other than the frequent insults, of why would he want to be with someone like me? Did I look like Luna material to him? I had no clue. What the hell did Luna material look like in his eyes? Some blond bimbo, no doubt. They were the she-wolves he tended to spend his time with within our pack. The ones who worshiped the ground he walked on. That would do anything he asked of them. Ones that I highly doubted read much more than the work set of them at school.

“Bailey!” my Mum yelled at me from the stairway of our family home. “Will you hurry up?!”

“Do I really need to come to the party?” I responded. “I am telling you, Miles will not be bothered if I am not there!”

“Your Aunt and Uncle will be though. And I am not explaining to them again why you are missing.” My Mum continues yelling. “Do you not realize just how many events you have missed this year, all because you have your head in a book?”

“Yeah Bai-Bai. Such a geek. No wonder you have no friends.” My sister Morgan giggles from outside my bedroom door.

“Piss off.” I hissed. “I have friends.”

I stormed from my room, and down the stairs toward my waiting family. I planned to greet the birthday boy, not that he would care in the slightest. I know that he would rather not see me at all. And then I would sneak home.

“Ew, are you wearing that?” Morgan asked.

I looked down at the skinny black trousers I had on and the white tank top. Great. I can’t win. Nothing I wear is approved of by my sister, evidently named the fashion queen without my knowledge. Oh well, I am dressed and wearing it. I think it looked good with my chunky black sandals I had on…

I scowled at my sister and walked out of the door. “Are we going or not?” I snapped at them all, truly not able to wait for the following month when I leave to go to university. Get away from them, and this pack!

The party was well underway when we arrived, music pounding from the speakers as couples made out in every available space, so I averted my eyes as we walked through the corridors of the packhouse to the lounge where we would no doubt find Miles reigning over his people. Being all important, like he was partial to considering himself.

‘Why are you here?’ Miles’s voice filled my mindlink, before I had even fully entered the room behind my parents.

Great. ‘I didn’t get a choice. Trust me, I would rather not be.’ I snapped back.

I was getting more than a little tired of the way he would treat me. Yes, he planned on rejecting me. Decided I was not for him, but he could have left it at that. I didn’t need treating like I was some sort of social pariah because of the fact he decided I was not right for him. I do not think I deserved that. I had endured enough bullying through my time in high school, for the fact I enjoyed my education.

‘Oh. Excuse me? Are you implying you were not going to come to the party of your next Alpha?’ Miles links with some serious attitude.

‘Miles, you just asked why I had bothered coming. Now you are asking if I was not going to come? Make your mind up.’ I argued.

‘Remember who I am Bailey. You are not above me. Never will be. Could have been equal to me at most had I seen you as suitable to be my mate, but no. You were beneath that honor.’ He sneers.

I felt anger racing through me. ‘And you think I would not have rejected you?’ I snapped, moving back toward the exit, not wanting to be here anymore. Until I felt a hand grabbing the back of my tank top, yanking me back.

My eyes darted upward to see the dark eyes of Miles. Sneering down at me. Our Pack’s upcoming Alpha. The most arrogant man I think I have ever met. One, thankfully, I did not have to be mates with any longer as the stupid fucker had chosen to reject his own fated mate before even giving her a chance. “Going somewhere Bailey?” he asked, his voice full of spite.

“Well, I do believe you asked me why I was here, so I assumed you wanted me to leave.” I told him.

Miles bows his head down so it is level with mine, he inhales deeply, like he still enjoys the scent of me. He has done this numerous times of late, which I find quite bizarre. But, I ignore him as he tilts his head to look at me, “Hmm, I think my Mum and Dad may have something to say if you leave. Their clever little Bailey. Heaven forbid.” He presses his forehead against mine. “Just stay away from me, and do not spoil my fun.”

I shake my head in disbelief at him, as he stalks away. Did he even think for a moment I would be going near him if I could avoid it? I would rather be anywhere but near him!

“Bailey, why are you harassing my friend for?” I heard my brother, Jordan demand, as he suddenly approached, causing many people to turn around and look at me. Wonderful. Nothing like starting pack gossip is there. I am sure Miles would appreciate that!

“I wasn’t harassing him, he came to speak to me. Asking why I had come.” I told him, and my brother laughed. He is as much an idiot as Miles. Any of my friends who have big brothers hate how protective they are. Me? No, my big brother is the one leading all the bullying and being a total dick to me. He finds great embarrassment in the fact his younger sister is far from being one of the popular group, and is, in his words, ‘far too into her books’. I think, in all honesty, my entire family found me, in one way or another, a huge embarrassment.

“Well, he has a point. Not like you will be joining in with the celebrations. You will probably be sitting in a quiet corner somewhere reading.” He teases.

“Well, it is certainly more intellectually pleasing than any of you would be.” I smirked at him as I walked away from my brother who was standing looking confused. I am sure he had no clue what I meant. The scary thing is he will be the next, pack Beta. Heaven help our pack. Between him and Miles they only had one brain cell between them, and that was one that they shared, I am sure of it! And even then, I think it was rechargeable and started losing power and knowledge at a rapid rate! They only graduated high school because they paid people to do their work for them.

As I snuck away, out of the busy lounge to the top of the stairway, where I hoped to hide out for as long as possible, I heard footsteps behind me. I quickly turned, hoping it was simply someone on their way to their bedroom or even to one of the spare bathrooms on this floor. But, sadly, luck was not on my side tonight. No. Miles was following me. Eyebrows raised and looking quite irritated.

“Oi. I want to talk to you.” he demanded.

“You asked me to go away a minute ago, didn’t you?” I asked him.

“Don’t think so, think it was more a case of why you were here.” Miles says with a smirk. Sitting on the top step with me.

“Miles, you have the whole pack here for your birthday, I am sure whatever you need to speak to me about can wait.” I shrugged, desperately craving peace, which, considering the pounding beat of the music playing, would be difficult.

“No. Why didn’t you tell me you were leaving?” he questions, like he is irate at the fact I had not let him know. Why would I let him know?

“Why would I? We aren’t friends, Miles. You also are not my Alpha yet. It was arranged with my parents, me and your Dad, as Alpha.” I explained to him, unsure why this would even bother him. If anything, I would think he would be glad to get rid of me.

“You are going away though.” he murmurs.

“That is generally what happens when you go to college or university. Yeah.” I said with another shrug.

“There wasn’t one closer to home?” he hisses. “Because it seems to me you picked the one furthest away.”

“What does it matter to you? You hate me. I won't be here, You get your wish of being rid of me.” I snapped, truly sick of him trying to dictate to me what I should and shouldn’t be doing. I had worked hard in school, so I could do this. My parents had spoken to my Aunt and Uncle, the Luna and Alpha of our pack to allow me special permission to go to a university out of state to study, saying it was what I had dreamed of. I had nothing holding me back. And, with the fact Miles did not want me for his mate, or his Luna, I truly did not. Not that any of them knew of that. That was our own secret.

Even despite the pull to him as my mate since my wolf had arrived, I still found him truly repulsive. He sickened me. Though, the pains when he slept with the many she-wolves that visited his bed, made it even easier to detest the man that he had become. I still had no clue what I had done to deserve this treatment from this man, other than not being one of the popular group. But, I knew I deserved better than him.

Miles glanced at me, momentarily a thoughtful look passed over his face, almost caring, before a hardness replaced it. “That much is true. No more having to see the disappointing failure the moon goddess made of mating me to you. At least not for a few years. Who knows, perhaps you will meet someone while there. I suggest you do. That way you won’t have to come back, because, I, as Alpha, will be looking for my Luna.”

“Miles, I honestly do not care if you find someone else.” I told him, going to stand and head home, not wishing to spend another moment in the same place as him.

As I went to move away, he grabbed my hand, pulling me to him, so I was once more sitting level with him on the top step of the first floor landing of our packhouse. “Always so righteous aren’t you Bailey? You say you don’t care? We will see. Well, this will be on my terms. I, Miles Davenport, reject you, Bailey West, as my fated mate…” he began, and my head began to whirl as his words sunk in. The realization and excruciating pain of what was happening becoming too much for me…

# Chapter 3 Bailey

Three Years Later

I drove the long road down to pack. I hated this drive. It was like returning to hell for me. Lotus Shadow Pack. My very own version of hell. Though, three years away, studying had been truly amazing. Transforming myself into the woman I should always have been. Confident. Self-assured. Brave. Just me. And now a fully qualified teacher.

As a she-wolf, you spend so many years of your life being told your focus is finding your fated mate. Settling down with them and creating a strong matebond. A love. A family. Well, once I had come to accept that my naïve, teenage dreams would never surface, thanks to the moon goddess pairing me with a mate so incapable of loving anyone other than himself, I decided that my focus would be my career. My education had always been something I took great pride in. I loved to learn, and I had decided that I wanted to pass that gift along. I no longer cared what others thought of me. And, while at university, it felt so wonderful to be surrounded by others who felt the same way. I finally felt like I fit in somewhere.

And, I believe that is what allowed me to become the person I was meant to be. However, now, I had to return to my pack, at their orders. The agreement was, once I had completed my degree, I would return home. Unless, of course, I had found my fated mate. But, I knew within my heart, that was never to happen. For, my fated mate sat at home. Lording it over our pack. Acting like he was the best thing since sliced bread. Sleeping with any she-wolf that came near him, from what I heard, having rejected me.

I pulled up at our guarded pack gates. Harley, one of our pack warriors, currently on guard duty, stepped forward to my car window. “ID” he ordered.

I frowned at him. I do not think I have been asked for ID before when returning home, even in all the times I have visited home, though in all fairness, those visits have been few and far between. My visits were only when they were required of me. I had grown to loathe this place, and coming back had become less of a priority for me over the time I was away...

“Harley, it is me. Bailey.” I explained, trying not to smile at his mistake.

Harley looked at me closer. “Shit. Sorry Bailey, didn’t really recognize you there. You changed your hair. And you aren’t wearing your glasses. You look good.” He says with a shrug, quickly looking away, clearly embarrassed by his faux-pas.

I smirk at his response. Yes, my hair is somewhat tamer than it used to be. The curls straightened out, and my hair now neat and sleek down my back. My glasses I had worn for reading had been long gone. Having got my eyes fixed with laser eye surgery whilst away. Plus, I now wore a little simple make-up to accentuate my features. Nice to know somebody has noticed a difference…

“No problem. You still need ID?” I asked him.

He grins at me. “I think I know who you are. Nice to see you.” he nods at me in acknowledgment as the gate opens for me. “Maybe catch you around while you are back.” He adds as I begin to drive away.

I smiled in response, I guess there would be nothing to stop me catching up with any guy I wanted to now. Not that I was really bothered right now... but it was not like I had a fated mate to wait for any longer. And it wasn’t like Miles was making a point of staying single. Every time I had returned home, he had had a different she-wolf on his arm. Parading them through pack like a prized possession, only to have traded her in by the time I returned on my next visit. He was turning into quite the lothario. And quite a joke in my eyes.

I set off along the quiet, familiar roads of our sweet old pack. The evening sun was settling in the sky as I moved my car down the route to my family home. No doubt my Mum would be there waiting for me, perhaps my Dad, if he was in from work by now. My brother and sister, I was unsure. They still both lived at home with my parents, but were back and forth to friends' homes and my brother was looking to move into the Beta suite in the packhouse soon enough, in preparation for taking on the role from my father when the time came. Either way, they rarely bothered to rush home to see me when they knew I was returning. I don’t think seeing me was at the top of their priority list…

I pulled my car up on the street in front of my familiar family home. I could not believe I was home. Stuck back here. The dread within my stomach churned heavily at the prospect of many years stuck here. Miserable and unhappy, with no way out, now my fated mate had rejected me. Not that anyone other than Miles and I knew of that. No. He had decided he would be considered weak if others knew an Alpha had gone against the powerful Moon Goddess’s choice. So, this was our secret. Or he would make me pay in ways I did not want to imagine, apparently.

And, in all honesty, I did not want to think of it. He had allowed me to go away to do my degree. Doing the final bit of convincing when my Uncle, the current Alpha, and Miles’s father, along with my parents were on the fence. Or, so he said. How true that was, I would never likely know the truth, but it had been for that reason, and that alone I had chosen to do as he had asked.

If he had done the things he said, then he had allowed me to fulfill my dream of gaining my degree of teaching away from pack. To allow me to be just me, not the daughter of the pack Beta. And I have thrived because of it. But, now, I had to return. Back to where I belonged. And, while I may have gained my degree, I had no real future prospects. I was likely stuck here.

I stepped from the car, determined more than ever to find work, as I heard my Mum’s voice. “Bailey!” she greeted me from the porch steps, a big smile upon her face. “You look beautiful sweetheart.”

I smiled back at her, as I moved toward the front door. Only to see Miles leaving the house next door to ours. The Alpha home. Could I have timed my arrival home any worse?

His eyes met mine, giving me a dark stare before looking at my Mum. “Hi Aunt Brianna. You didn’t say she was home today.”

Mum smiled at Miles like she thought the world of him, though most of the time she generally did. “Ah, I think it slipped my mind. Bailey is home for good now, Miles. How wonderful is that?”

Once more, Miles gave me a dark stare. “Hmmm. Truly wonderful.” he said with some serious contempt in his voice.

‘You stay out of my way unless I say otherwise, you understand?’ Miles mindlinks me, as he moves toward his car.

“Are you not going to speak to him Bai?” Mum tries. “He will be Alpha this time next year, you know?”

“Oh it doesn’t matter, Aunt Brianna. Bailey will be excused this time. I am sure she is tired from her drive back home. But no doubt I will be seeing her around. And yes, she will have to get used to me as her senior. Her Alpha.” He says with a sneer, and at his words my stomach twists into knots. I don’t think I can stay here… I not only need to find work, I need to find work away from my pack, so I can move away to get away from my psychotic Alpha and ex-mate!

# Chapter 4 Bailey

I sit out in the garden drinking my morning coffee, with my laptop open scrolling desperately through the job vacancies, when I hear a deep growl to my left, causing me to swirl my head to look. Miles was resting his head on the garden fence from next door, overlooking our back garden, to where I was sitting. Watching me intently, the look upon his face was one of sheer disgust...

I had no clue how long he had been standing there, or what had angered him to the point of growling, but he had made me jump. “Fucking hell, Miles.” I snapped, giving him a dark scowl. I had done well the past week since arriving and stayed out of his way. Managing to ensure I avoided all pack events, and ensuring I dodged any places he was likely to be. Yes, it meant I spent an awful lot of time in my bedroom at home, but I would rather do that than have to deal with him.",1,1751357480.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!""

""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.

Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.

She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.

Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.

What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers—Michael Osborne. The famed war god himself.

He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.

This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times—him finally coming to take her home.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.

Because it was him—he was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""

The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.

""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me—do you finally admit you were wrong?

""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment—she'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""

When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""

The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""

But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember—he was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.

Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.

When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.

She had thought, 'My fiancé can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement—risking his life, even, to spare me from harm.

'And my parents in the duke's estate—surely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'

But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment—merciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.

She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.

Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women—tools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.

They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.

But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.

Eventually, she stopped fighting back—not out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.

""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.

He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'

The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone—now it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.

He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'

Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""

But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No… please don't… don't touch me…""

""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""

His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""

Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.

In front of Michael—or her parents—she had never once had the right to feel wronged.

If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.

Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth—she'd been swapped at birth.

The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.

She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.

Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.

Whenever Willow Monson—the girl who'd lived her life—felt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.

Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.

They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""

Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.

Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.

But Willow ended up poisoned—vomiting blood.

Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.

Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away—banished from Pidence City forever.

Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""

No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.

The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.

In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.

But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp—believing that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.

A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.

Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""

Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.

Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back… then drag yourself back into that camp.""

# Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes

Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""

Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great—she's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""

Athena nodded quietly.

Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family—but she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.

Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.

She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now—of marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.

""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""

Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.

But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.

She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.

""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""

The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.

As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house—while Willow was merely adopted.

The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""

The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.

Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""

Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.

One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed—clearly selected for looks and cleverness.

""I'm Siena Hotham.""

""I'm Aliza Crofton.""

Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""

Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.

Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""

Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.

The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now—looking after their husbands and raising children.""

Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.

The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.

The table was already set. The meal was generous—four dishes and a soup—but the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.

She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.

Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""

Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""

Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""

Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten—this wasn't the military camp anymore.

This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.

The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat—it was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.

Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.

Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners—she looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.

Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.

After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.

""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.

Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.

Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly…""

Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them—calm, expressionless.

There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.

Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.

Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.

Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises—some new, others long faded.

If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.

After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine—soft, warm, and tailored to fit.

But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.

""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.

Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.

In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.

She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.

""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""

Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow—again.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.

When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.

She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.

He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""

The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty—for her.

At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'

But now… it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.

She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.

Eloise looked toward the door—and frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'

# Chapter 4 The One To Blame

Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.

""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""

""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.

He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""

Athena almost laughed out loud.

She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear—what I came back in from the military camp?""

That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""—not ""Mother.""

Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.

A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.

His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years… how did she waste away like this?'

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""

Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.

Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.

""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""

That warmth, that longing in her eyes—Athena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.

""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl… you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless… I couldn't protect you…""

Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.

The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened…

She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""

Just one word—and Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.

Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.

Athena had been home for some time now… and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""

She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.

Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.

Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.

She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'

But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.

Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""

Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars—blackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.

Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor… how did she end up like this?""

Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries—how did they happen?""

Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course…""

Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""

She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.

But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten—for three full years. How has she even survived?'

Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fiancé's command—how could anyone there lay a finger on you?""

Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""

Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""

Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""

She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""

Nicolas stared at her in silence.

She was smiling, yes—but it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.

His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak—when Willow's voice suddenly broke in.

""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak—if I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine—Athena never would've been punished.

""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe… maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents…""

She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.

Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""

Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is—what are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""

Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""

Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow—offering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.

And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.

But of course… she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.",1,1751357414.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

At the time, I never gave them much thought. Thinking they were just that… stories. Growing up, I soon realized that they weren’t lofty fantasies and fairy tales, but memories of her past, memories of our ancestors before our world turned to shit.When the uprising happened twelve years ago, all Fae creatures fought alongside the elves and the angels trying to right the wrongs of our ancestors from the great war, trying to restore the balance back to where it was meant to be.My parents were among those who fought bravely. I was nine at the time. My grandmother hid me in the bunker under our house, promising to watch over me if they didn’t return.Only when we came back up, the world had changed, and so did my life. My parents were gone. Not a single person who fought in the war survived. No Elves, no Fae, no Angels. Even the humans were mostly wiped out, including the Oracle. Her death was the biggest blow because with it, we lost not only lives, but our magic.I was part of a dying species. There were hardly any Fae left. A few hid, but we tried our best to keep to the shadows, trying to go unnoticed. I had never met another Fae other than my grandmother, yet I refused to believe we are the only ones left.We were on the bottom of the food chain now, next to humans. Ruled over by the Dragon Kingdom.The Dragon Kingdom was different from any before it, and those that ruled were merciless and cruel. No one was allowed in or out without their say so.I have never left the city, forced to hide amongst those that live here, hoping that we remain unnoticed. Because being Fae was a death sentence.At the top of the food chain were the Dragons, then the Lycans and Vampires. We used to be next before the Elves and the Pixies, then the Mermaids. Right at the bottom were humans.Now we were right beside them, the scavengers of the world, taking what was left after the rest discarded what they didn’t want. Fae without magic might as well have been human. We look like humans except our eyes, each unique to our bloodline. Mine were the color of amethyst, like my mother’s bloodline.My bloodline was all but eradicated. We used to be among one of the largest Fae families, helping to rule among our kind. My bloodline was royalty, now gone, just like our ancestors, leaving only me and my grandmother.My grandmother said our bloodline used to be among the royal Fae, that our ancestors achieved great things. Now I was the last one of our bloodline and possibly the second last Fae. Once I go, that’s it. The survival of my bloodline rests entirely upon my shoulders.Yep, the future didn’t look great for my family, soon to be snuffed out of existence.My twenty-first birthday was coming up. I had been dreading this day for as long as I could remember, the day when they would hunt me down and drag me to the castle. There weren’t many job opportunities for Fae, just like the humans.Fae were now nothing but a distant memory people refuse to believe existed, so we disguise ourselves by blending in with the humans. Most humans were sold into the sex trade or into slavery, unless, of course, you were caught and proven to be Fae.Then you only earned the right to die painfully for the sins of your ancestors. That is why no Fae exists. That is why my grandmother and I keep to the shadows, blending in with the humans, so we remain unnoticed.Turning twenty-one was a significant day for Fae creatures. It is the day when our magic is supposed to manifest. No Fae have been found since the uprising, at least not that I know of. It’s believed when we lost the war, then the Oracle it angered the fates, and they shunned the Fae stripping us of our magic. The ancestors turned their backs on all of us.My grandmother told me it was to try to stop the extinction of our kind, yet I believe they just gave up on all of us.These days, Dragons and vampires summon all humans on their birthdays. Humans would line up and stand before the rulers, who would ultimately decide their fate. If you showed any magical ability, they killed you instantly, whether or not you were Fae.In one week, they would summon me. My grandmother and I have remained hidden in the hopes I go unnoticed. My grandmother refused, point blank, to let them find me. She could not imagine me being sold off to the highest bidder.Yet, deep down, I knew she was powerless to stop them. Sure, she had power, the only Fae on earth with ancient magic still flowing through her veins. The magic that had kept us alive. Yet her magic was slowly dwindling. It would eventually die out. Then, we would truly face our demise.My grandmother coughs as she comes up behind me, pulling me from my thoughts. She grabs my hand, making me look at her. Her pale face holds a knowing look, like she knew what I was thinking. I never doubted her ability to read people. She often knew me better than I knew myself.“What are you thinking, my child?” she asks, her eyes softening as she looks at me.“Nothing grandma, but I will go get something for that cough. It has lasted too long,” I say worriedly. I can’t afford to lose her too. She was all I had left in this world. My grandmother shook her head, but I stood up, not taking no for an answer.“Here take this,” she said, pulling her wedding band from her withered old finger, it slipped off easily, much too big for her frail finger. The ring was one of her most prized possessions, with intricate vines wrapping around the band.“I won’t allow you to sell any more of your mother’s things for me.” I hold the gold band in my hand. It was another family heirloom that was given to her by her late husband, my pop. Passed down from his mother. I close my hand before dropping it into the pocket of my jeans.“I will be as quick as possible, grandma. Try and stay warm,” I tell her, trying to put her mind at ease.I grab my coat, throwing it on as I walk outside. The snow is sinking into my holey shoes, making my toes go numb.We wanted to leave the city, but the Dragon lords refused to let anyone leave. Guards are stationed at every checkpoint, and in our opinion, it wasn’t worth the risk.But being a Fae in the city was hard. I struggled finding work because I couldn’t remain in one place for too long; anyone looking too hard would be able to tell I was Fae. My grandmother, who was unable to use magic to disguise herself, could not work either.So, my options were scavenging and bartering or being forced to steal.Walking up the muddy streets, I retrieve my contact lenses and pop them in, instantly turning my eyes to a mud brown. I hate wearing them, my vision was enhanced being Fae, and I could see every line on the thin film irritating my vision.Rounding the corner onto the next street, I glance up to see the dirty wooden sign that indicated I had arrived at the pharmacist.The man that worked there was a nice human, and since money was scarce here, he would allow me to barter for what I needed, gold being one the hardest-to-come-by currencies yet also the most valuable.I drop my gaze and start walking, trying to blend into the crowds of people. Making my way into the derelict store, I remove my hood, letting my black hair cascade down my back like a veil.Victor, the store owner, looks up. A smile plays on his lips when he sees me. He always liked my grandmother. They used to be friends before everything went to shit.“Elora dear, how is your grandmother?” he asks.“Not good, Victor. The cough hasn’t gone away. She is getting worse,” I tell him, retrieving my grandmother’s wedding band from my pocket.I drop it on the counter, shooting him a knowing look. He snatches it, placing it in his pocket, and nods his head before ducking out the back and bringing back a bottle of liquid. Victor knows what my grandmother is, yet he never mentions it, knowing it is a death sentence if anyone heard him speak of the Fae.“Give her this three times a day; I haven’t got anything stronger. Herbs are becoming harder to find, especially in the winter.” I nod before grabbing the bottle and placing my hood back over my head.“Elora stay safe out there,” he warns, following behind me, getting ready to barricade himself in before those that go bump in the night come out to play.Bowing my head against prying eyes, I take off for home, running. When I reach the corner, I run into someone.I mutter “Sorry” at them before I go to take off, only for them to grab my arm, ripping me in front of them. His grip on my arm is tight but also warm as I feel his heat seep into my skin through the jacket.“Take the hood off,” a man’s deep voice commands. I try to free myself of his grip, yet he is stronger.He yanks my hood off, revealing my black hair. I continue averting my eyes. My heart skips a beat when I hear his voice again.“Look at me, girl,” the voice grumbles.I shake my head, trying yet again to wriggle out of his grip. He grabs my face, forcing my eyes to look into his.My eyes dart to his gold reptilian eyes, fear clear on my faces.This man is Dragon!Chapter 2Dragons stood taller than any other supernatural creature in the city, they also had this air around them that told you they were a predator. Their godlike appearances made it blatantly obvious what they are.However, only three Dragons resided in this city. The dragon lords ruled, and the city was their playground and they only allowed us to merely exist here.Another strange fact about Dragons was no female dragons had been born since the war, making the Dragon lords angry, fuelling their hate for the Fae. They too were a dying species.Although immortal, most have spent their lives alone or chose to take another male as a mate. I had seen the Dragon lords from afar, but never got close enough to actually meet one and I prayed I never would.There are three lords and rumors circulated through the city that when they couldn’t find their mates, they chose to mate each other, hoping to keep themselves strong enough to rule over the kingdom.Sometimes people would be forced into the castle, never to be seen again. That was particularly true for any woman to pass through those gates.Dragons were insatiable and impulsive, usually taking a woman before killing her, it didn’t matter what species or status they held, no one survived them once they stepped through those iron gates.That's the kind of crisis I was facing right now. I was afraid of this Dragon would take me because I didn’t follow his command.I hear him growl lowly; it rumbles through his chest, his eyes flicker dangerously, eyes that weren’t human, his tan skin is warm even through my parka.I barely reached the middle of his chest. His hair was dark, almost black in color but longer on top, he looked like he hadn’t shaved for a couple of days, stubble lining his face, his features were sharp, high cheekbones and nice full lips, he looked like a woman’s wet dream. Yet his aura was intimidating, his grip on me unrelenting.“What are you?” he demands.One thing I hated about being Fae was our inability to lie. We could beat around the bush but couldn’t answer a direct question dishonestly. I press my lips into a tight line, fighting the urge to answer as I stare wide eyed at the man.A fight between two homeless people breaks out up the street, distracting him for a second. I don’t waste any time before ripping my parka off and sliding my arms out, escaping his clutches.I hear a mighty roar and know he is chasing after me. I keep running, refusing to look back.When I see houses lined up along the street, I dart through their yards, jumping fence after fence and finally losing him.Desperate, I continue to run until I find our house, bursting through the door and slamming it shut behind me. My heart was pounding in my chest so hard I could hear its erratic rhythm. That was close, too close.“Elora dear, is that you?” I hear my grandma say before she breaks out into a violent coughing fit. I make my way to her; she is still in the kitchen sitting at the table. She smiles softly before noticing my jacket is missing.“What happened?” she asks breathlessly. Worry making her thin brows furrow.“I ran into a Dragon,” I say, my voice shaking. “He chased me, but I think I lost him.”My grandmother frowns in mild panic and starts coughing again. I race to her side, looking on helplessly as the coughing fit racks her slight frame.“I lost the medicine grandma; it was in the jacket. I will have to try again tomorrow,” I tell her, tears welling in my eyes.“It is okay dear, what matters is you are safe now,” she murmurs, though I can sense the fear of me nearly being caught worrying her. Her hands tremble slightly on the table as her nails tap with worry.The night goes quickly. We were asleep when we heard the voices of people out in the street screaming. I jolt upright, paralysed with fear. Walking over to the window, I pull the curtain back and peer out, seeing men with torches, some in human form, others not.They were ripping people into the street, going from door to door. I see a man in armour go to the house next door to us before I hear the shrill sound of a woman screaming as she is dragged into the street, her family looking on helplessly as she is dragged by her hair.My blood runs cold hearing her begging and pleading with them as they drag her from her house. The entire street is in chaos. I run over to the couch where my grandmother is sleeping, only she too is now wide awake and looking alert having heard the cries of everyone on the street.“Grandma get up we need to leave. They are going door to door,” I whisper, slipping my holey boots on my feet and quickly doing the laces. Slipping my contacts in, I hear more screams coming from outside and people fighting.“Come on, grandma get up,” I tell her, pulling on her arm. She shakes her head before pulling a small knife from the coffee table drawer into her lap. She looks up at me with a sad look on her face.“Run, Elora. I won’t allow them to know. I will only slow you down. You need to leave without me,” she whispers. I looked at her, panicked. What is she talking about?“No grandma, come on. We need to leave now,” I tell her, trying to get her to her feet. She shakes me off and shakes her head.“I promised to keep you safe. I can’t if you don’t go now.”“What are you talking about, grandma? Promised who?”“Remember the stories, Elora. You need to remember the stories. Now run.”“No, I am not leaving without you.” I tell her, feeling tears running down my face. Before someone bangs on the door so hard, I thought it was going to smash off its hinges.“Please grandma, we have to go.”“I love you, Elora,” my grandma whispers before raising the knife and slashing her own throat. I scream and clutch at her neck, trying to stem the bleeding.“Run,” she gurgles out. Just as they kicked the door in, my hands coated in her blood. Adrenaline kicks in, and I take off out the back door, through the criss-crossed streets of the city.I can hear a soft sobbing only to realize it was coming from me as hot tears run down my cheeks at what my grandmother just did. The images forever burnt into my memory.I clamp my hand over my mouth, trying to stop the noises I am making, my breathing erratic. My heart is pounding so hard I can hear it. Looking over the dumpster, I duck back down behind the dumpster when I hear a man call out, pointing in my direction.“You there! Stop!” I don’t listen; instead, I take off running. I run to the end of the alleyway to find it is blocked off by a building and a brick wall making it dead-end.Hearing someone crying behind the dumpster, I look down only to notice a little girl dressed in rags. I pull the ladder down and reach my hand down to her.“Where is your mother?” I ask, peering down at her tear-stained face.“They took her,” she sobs.Without hesitating, I hoist her up so she can climb, and together we race upwards toward the roof. But not fast enough for the vampire chasing us.A strong hand grips my ankle, ripping me back down to the ground. I fall painfully on top of a man, my head smacking the ground with a loud thud as I bite into my tongue. Another man retrieves the girl, and I hear her scream before a loud SMACK comes from him slapping her on the face.Her dirty matted blonde hair is all I see as her head whips to the side, blood trickling from her lip and the sound of flesh on flesh echoing down the alleyway.“Leave her, she is just a child!” I scream. The little human girl, who appears to be maybe nine years old, escapes the man and runs behind me, hiding against my back.A tall man with black armour walks over his hair down to shoulders and a huge scar across his face, his crimson eyes reflecting oddly as he stares at us.A Vampire.Chapter 3Chapter 3“Hurry up, bring them to the castle with the rest of them,” he yells to the other men. The man who caught me grabs my hair, the roots painfully tearing from my skull as my head is yanked back.“Move,” he screams in my face. I obey, following the Vampire man dressed in black armour. The little girl hangs onto the back of my shirt.When we get to the main street, I find a huge line of women being herded to the castle. They shove us in the line behind more women, all sobbing as they had been ripped out of their beds in the middle of the night and torn away from their families.When we finally walk through the high castle gates, I find the group of women all separated into rows. A man I recognize to be a Dragon standing at the front, watching everyone be dragged in and lined up. I am in one of the middle rows.When I see his eyes dart over the crowd, I quickly duck my head down, hoping he didn’t notice me staring. Another man walks along the first line looking at each person and grips their faces looking at their eyes. He then dismisses them, and another man marches them back out the iron gates once they have been cleared and declared not to be whomever they were looking for.I make sure to keep my head down to avoid making eye contact.However, a deep husky voice comes above my head. “Look at me,” I can feel his eye penetrating into me.I flinch away from the anger in his words. He grabs my hair, pulling my head back. I close my eyes breathing through the pain searing through my skull as I feel my hair being ripped out.“I said look at me,” he growls again. I slowly raise my head to be met with the same hypnotic gold snake eyes of the man I ran into on the street. He scrutinizes my face before letting my hair go. My eyes instantly snap back to the ground.“Remove them,” he says, his voice daring me to disobey.“What?” I whisper, confused.“The contact lenses; remove them now.” I shake my head in a pleading sort of way, knowing if I do, I will be killed instantly.“Remove them or I will,” he grumbles, grabbing my arm. I whimper at his rough voice echoing into the darkness, making me shiver. I slowly lift my fingers, and one by one, I took out the contact lenses to reveal my sparkling violet eyes . He grabs my chin, forcing my eyes to meet his.I hear everyone gasp before I hear the murmur of whispers throughout the crowd.“Fae.”“She is a Fae.” Everyone’s eyes on mine, which I know are glowing fluorescently into the night. Burning brightly like an amethyst beacon.“Silence,” the man yells out to the crowd. The chatter instantly died down at his words.“I knew I sensed a Fae when you bumped into me.” His lips were next to my ear, his cool breath sending shivers down my spine as he moves closer. He leans in inhaling my scent and I can feel his lips barely touching the skin in the crook of my neck.“You’re coming with me,” he whispers, grabbing me and pulling me towards the old sandstone castle. It was huge, and something right out of a fairy tale, only dark and covered in snow, the vines growing along the sides looked like snakes, dying from the cold and the sandstone high walls tarnished from not being maintained properly.I struggle, trying to free myself from his grip. He looks to one of the guards that we pass.“Kill the rest,” he commands, and chaos ensues. All the women’s voices start screaming, echoing through the night at his words. Fear so pungent I could smell and taste it, as the guards moved closer, circling around and trapping them, and leaving them nowhere to run.“No please, they didn’t do anything,” I begged as I fought against him. He stops and looks down at me and I cower away from his gaze, knowing I shouldn’t speak out of turn, especially to a Dragon king.He grabs my face, making me look at him.“Please, I will do anything you want, just don’t hurt them,” I beg. Tears roll down my face as I glance at the women behind me, begging for their lives. All staring at me, fear in their eyes as all the guards freeze waiting for his answer. His thumb rubs over my bottom lip, and a smirk forms on his lips.“Anything?” he asks, his thumb pulling on my bottom lip softly. My eyes move back to the crowd behind him, before looking down at the little girl still clinging onto my shirt.The fear in their eyes makes a tear slip from mine, all begging me to agree with whatever it is he wants from me.“Yes, anything,” I whisper, feeling defeated. He smiles, and I can see all his perfectly straight pearly white teeth gleaming back at me.I study his face. He has an evil glint in his eye, like he is looking at his prey. Nice full lips and high cheekbones with a firm jaw. He looks like the reincarnation of a god, built strong and beautiful, only I know he is the devil in disguise.“Let them go,” he commands, raising his voice, his eyes not leaving mine. I shudder at the thought of being alone with this big brooding man. I hear the little girl sob beside me, which makes the man focus his gaze on her.Pushing her behind me with my hand, his eyes snap back to mine, a devious smile playing on his lips.“She is coming too,” he says, not leaving any room for argument, not that I would dare argue back. I hear everyone running out of the castle gates before he changes his mind. Before I hear the metal gates shut loudly, the steel groans as the lock slips into place.He tugs my arm, pulling me toward the castle. Torches are lit along the path as we walk toward it. The only light coming from the lanterns next to the huge heavy double doors leading inside the castle.He walks down a hall before leading us up some stairs. My feet make noises on the stone steps as we climb them. He pulls me to a door and opens it, swinging it open to reveal a room. A huge four-poster bed sits in the middle with black gauze hanging from the top.He lets me go, leaving me standing in the middle of the room in front of another fireplace that is taller than me. The warmth is a welcome relief after spending hours in the cold. However, I feel more terrified than ever. He folds his arms over his bulging, muscular chest.Another man enters the room, his skin the color of mocha, with dark onyx eyes. His chest is bare, revealing his muscular body and abs that look like they are carved from stone, a deep v-line disappearing into the waistband of his pants.He smiles when he walks in, noticing me. I can tell he isn’t a Dragon but Lycan, which leaves me confused. Only the Dragon Kings live in the castle with their slaves, so why was this man standing beside a Dragon?“You found her,” says the Lycan; his voice is silky and deep with a slight accent I do not recognize. He smiles, revealing his sharp teeth. As his eyes look me up and down.I take a step back, feeling my heart thumping faster in my chest. He steps forward, crossing his arms across his chest. Both of them are standing over me.“Strip,” says the Dragon King. I shake my head, not wanting to remove my clothes in front of their watchful, lust-filled eyes.Chapter 4“I said strip,” he repeats, raising an eyebrow at me, daring me to disobey.I struggle to remove my shirt, trying to cover my bare chest by turning away from him. The girl beside me starts to remove her clothes as well.“Not you, child. I don’t want to see you naked; you’re only here to make sure she obeys orders,” he says, making me relieved as she pulls her dress strap back up.I remove my pants, leaving me only in my panties. Using my hands, I cover my breasts before turning around to face them.The Lycan man steps forward, he licks his lips approvingly making me flinch. “Remove them,” he says looking down at my panties.“Please,” I beg, not wanting to remove them.“Remove them or I kill the child,” he says tauntingly. I look at the little girl who darted behind me at his words. I feel my cheeks burn with embarrassment.This was so degrading and humiliating.I pull my panties down before placing one hand over my breasts and the other trying to cover my lady parts. Both men step forward and I step back, nearly tripping over the girl behind me.The Lycan man grabs my wrist, pulling my arm away from my chest, my ample breasts on display for them. I feel a tear run down my cheek as the other man removes my hand from my sensitive parts.“Why are you crying? You have nothing to be embarrassed about,” says the Dragon. How didn’t they understand how degrading this is? No one should have to be put through this humiliation. I had never been naked in front of anyone besides my grandmother.“Open your legs,” he growls, stepping closer. The Lycan man peers around me.“Close your eyes little one,” he whispers to the small girl, and I feel a sob leave my lips. When the girl does as she is told, he stands upright.He taps my foot with his, forcing my legs apart. His fingers move to my slit before he shoves his finger inside me quickly before removing it. I cry out at the sudden intrusion.“A virgin like I thought,” he murmurs. I watch horrified as he sucks the finger into his mouth and moans loudly.“You made me strip to see if I was a virgin? What, asking was too hard?” I ask but instantly regret it as they both step closer.“You can put your clothes back on,” he says. The Dragon bent down and picked up my shoes. He looks at them before tossing them in the fireplace. I quickly get dressed.“Follow us, we will take you to your chambers,” the Lycan man says. We follow silently. The Lycan leads the way while the Dragon remains behind us. I can feel his eyes boring into my back, feel the little girl’s arms grip my hips tightly.We stop outside a door on the bottom floor, he opens the door and reveals a small room with a single bed and small fireplace.I watch mesmerised as the Dragon man walks in and over to the fireplace, he takes a breath in then blows it out of his mouth like he's blowing a kiss. Yet I can feel the heat in the air rising rapidly as the logs start burning catching alight. He turns and winks at me.I notice off to the side is a bathroom with a shower and toilet. I don’t move though, too scared by the men standing in front of me, I don’t want to risk angering them.“You will stay here for now until Silas comes back and verifies you are who we think you are,” says the Lycan man, his eyes burning oddly mirroring the flames coming from the fireplace.“If you need anything knock on the door, someone will hear you. My name is Matitus, this is Dragus,” says the man I recognize to be a Dragon. I store their names to memory, hoping I never have to utter them.They then walk out, closing the door behind them. The little girl tugs at my shirt making me look down at her.“Are they going to kill us?” she asks, concerned. Now that they are gone, I can really look at her. The poor girl is underweight, not that that is something unheard of in the city, starvation being the main killer.“I don’t think so, well I don’t think they will kill you anyway,” I tell her. Suddenly, there is a knock on the door, and an old woman who I believe is a human walks in with her head down carrying towels and a pile of clothes. Yet something seemed off about her, I just couldn’t put my finger on why I felt that way.“For you,” she mutters, her eyes never peering up. She thrusts them forward again and I grab them from her before she hurriedly walks back out. I can sense her fear, like she was told not to talk to linger too long.It would also make sense why she didn’t look up and make eye contact. She then shuts the door and I hear the jingle of keys and I know she locked it. I place the clothes on the bed along with the towels.“What is your name?” I ask the little girl who comes and stands beside me. “Lilith” she whispers, looking at the pile.“My name is Elora,” I tell her.“Elora?” she repeats, trying out my name and making me smile. I dig through the clothes and take Lilith to the shower.After that, we sit in front of the fire for a while and eventually fall asleep.I am jolted awake when I hear the door swing open, creaking loudly. Matitus, one of the Dragon Kings, is standing in the doorway. I sit up, groggy before recognition hits me and I become anxious.Dropping my gaze to the floor. My long black hair falling to my sides creating a veil. I see his boots come into my line of vision. He then kneels in front of me and grips my chin, bringing my gaze to meet his own.“Why aren’t you sleeping on the bed?” he asks curiously.“We fell asleep,” I tell him. I watch as he cocked his head to the side examining my face carefully before he lets go of my chin. I see Dragus walk in behind him carrying a tray with what smells like chicken soup. He sets the tray on the desk.“Get on the bed,” Dragus says, making me glance at him. I feel sick suddenly, my blood running cold at his words. He seems to notice what he said before putting his hands up in mock surrender.“Not in that way, take the girl with you,” he says, looking down at Lilith laying on the floor. I place my hand on her back, shaking her softly. Her eyes open before she jolts upright leaning against me in fear as she tries to get as far away from them as possible. I stand up to suddenly feel the cut on my back reopen and tear.I grimace, feeling warm blood running down my spine, but I ignore it. Instead picking up Lilith and placing her so she is sitting on the edge of the bed.I go to sit beside her, when I feel hot fingers move across my shoulder brushing my hair out of the way before lightly tracing the mark running from my left shoulder down to my right hip. I flinch slightly as it stings. I can feel the singlet sticking to the blood as his fingers run over it.“Silas won’t like that” I hear Dragus mutter as I sit next to Lilith on the bed. Dragus then brings the tray over, sitting it between us both. Lilith looks at me unsure and I nod my head telling her it’s okay.She must be starving, and when she finishes her piece of bread, I give her mine before turning to look at the two men standing in the room. They are both still watching me with indecipherable expressions on their faces.“What is your name?” Matitus asks. Instead of answering I fight the urge and ask a question of my own, trying to avoid giving them my name. I know if they ask again, I won’t be able to help but answer them.“What do you want with me?” They seem taken aback by my question and I have a feeling no one who has stepped in this castle has ever spoken out of line, let alone asked them a question as to their intentions.“Your name?” Matitus asks his tone telling me to answer or else. I shiver as the urge to answer honestly takes over; I try to fight against it, sweat beading on my neck. Trying to ignore a direct question is painful to a Fae, telling a lie is almost impossible. One of the things I hate about being Fae. Matitus steps closer his hand cupping my cheek.“Fae can’t lie or help but to answer. Why are you fighting against answering me?”I shake my head and his fingers stroke my cheek softly, I grit my teeth trying to fight the urge to answer. “Elora” I stammer out breathlessly.“Good girl,” he says, letting go of my face and stepping back.“Why didn’t you want to answer?” he asks, cocking his head to the side. I see Dragus also watching me intently, his face holding some emotion, I don’t recognize. Was it awe? Wonder? I don’t know but it made me uncomfortable. I grit my teeth at his question not wanting to answer, but I know the words will come out anyway.“Elora Aziza.” My words spew out of me in a rush.“You’re from a royal bloodline?” Matitus steps back, recognition shining in his eyes, and he looks to Dragus.Chapter 5Chapter 5I nod my head knowing it is useless trying to fight the urges to answer.Aziza was a known name amongst the Fae, they are direct descendants of the Royal Fae. My grandmother told me the chosen one would be born of one of the three royal bloodlines. Aziza, Zana, and Helcate.That was all the Oracle knew, apparently. She didn’t know which generation but that they would be of Royal Fae blood and be the Fae’s redemption.Dragus steps forward. “I haven’t heard that name in decades,” he says, kneeling in front of me.“Eat little one, I mean neither of you any harm,” he says turning to Lilith who had stopped eating and listened intently to their questions. She resumes eating and I rub her cheek assuredly.“Silas will want to know for sure,” Dragus says, looking up at Matitus. Matitus looked a little worried by his words, his lips pursing and his brows furrowed while his eyes flickered dangerously making my heart beat a little faster. He nodded once before glancing at me with what appeared to be worry in his eyes.“Why am I here?” I repeat daringly. They don’t seem bothered by my questions, but I also know that no one would dare question them, they were known for being merciless killers.“All will be revealed when Silas returns, eat and rest for now. Abigail will be by later in the morning with some chores.”I nod, glad that they were finally leaving. I watch as they both leave and close the door, I hear lock clicking in place and I finally let out the breath I hadn’t realized I was holding before I turned to Lilith. Her bowl was empty, so I pushed mine towards her.“You have it,” I tell her. She was terribly skinny, and she needed it more than I did. Lilith thanked me before quickly gobbling my soup down.When she finished, I place the tray on the desk before pulling the blankets and sheets back on the bed. And climbing in, Lilith curls up beside me and I wrap an arm over her protectively. We both drift off once again.The next morning, I was awakened by someone opening the door. A woman stands in the doorway. She looks to be around my age, but her skin is chafed like she spent a lot of time outdoors in the cold. Her blue eyes look at mine with curiosity before turning away.“I’m Abigail, follow me please,” she says, looking at me before noticing Lilith who is also awake and alert to the newcomer. We quickly sit up and walk to the door.Peering out the door I notice Abigail was waiting at the end of the hall. She waves us to follow, which we do obligingly. She walks us to a large kitchen area where people are busy preparing food and cleaning dishes.They look up when we enter, their eyes darting away before snapping back to mine. I see the woman in the middle nudge her friend and her brown eyes dart to mine widening, a huge grin lighting up her face. She has freckles and red hair that looks wild and untameable. “A Fae,” she whispers.At her words, everyone in the room stops to look at Lilith and I. To which, Abigail clears her throat before speaking, her tone harsh.“Yes, the girl is a Fae, now get back to work and stop gawking,” she says, dismissing them as they hurriedly resume their tasks.Abigail hands both of us an apple before telling us to follow. We eat our apples while following behind her as she stops at the front of a huge cupboard in the hall. Opening the doors, I can tell it was a cleaning cupboard, with various chemicals on the shelves and mops and brooms along with a cleaning cart.“You will both be cleaning the library at the front of the castle, when you're done with that come and see me for more work” she tells me, pushing a cart with cleaning supplies toward me and pointing us in the direction of the library.I walk down the stone corridors towards the front of the castle, stopping when we finally find the room I noticed yesterday. Pushing the cart to the side, I grab out a cloth and some polish, as I hand a duster to Lilith and tell her to dust the blinds. I started the bookshelves and I can’t help but notice most of the books were diaries and books on the different sorts of creatures roaming the earth.I continue dusting the shelves before coming to the last one, where I find the entire bookshelf is full of books on Fae history.Most books on the origins of our people and our magic were destroyed after the war. Yet, there I stood, amazed at how many books they had.My grandmother had one book on our history which we always kept hidden but here, there were hundreds. I let my fingers skim over the leather-bound books that held the stories of my ancestors, when I hear someone clear their throat.Turning around I see Matitus standing behind me, making me jump, my backside brushing up against the bookshelf. He is staring at the book my fingers were touching. His eyes darken as they move back to mine which makes my heart rate pick up and a chill crawls up my spine making me fight the urge to shiver under his deadly gaze.“What were you doing?” he asks. I wanted to shrink under his hardened gaze.“I was just looking, I didn’t mean to do anything,” I tell him, my heart skipping a beat.He nods,“If you want to read that you should also read this,” he says, holding another book out toward me as he steps in the room. I take the book from him and look at it. It’s a book on Dragons and mates. I look up at him.“Read them. I know Fae have their own stories of the past, but what if they aren’t correct? What if your ancestors lied?” he says.“Fae can’t lie,” I whisper, not understanding what he means.“They can and did long ago, your kind blames the Dragons for the wars and the blood spilled, yet what they took from us far outweighs anything we could have ever done to any of you,” he tells me, and I feel anger build up at his words bursting out of me.“What have you taken from us? You killed my kind off,” I tell him incredulously. The nerve he has saying what we did was worse, when they killed every one of my kind.“Your kind aren’t the only ones forced into extinction, Elora; my kind is nearly extinct as well because of what they did.”“And what is that?” I dare to ask, not liking the way he talks about Fae.“Read the books and you will find out,” he says before walking out and shutting the door behind him.I stare at the closed door, when I see that he isn’t going to return, I relax slightly. Picking up the book on Fae history, I sit back on the bed and start reading. I can’t remember the last time I actually read a book. Being constantly on the move meant I didn’t get much time to read and with moving, books would mean more things to carry.After a few hours of reading, my back aches from being slumped over. The book was pretty much the same as what my grandmother had already told me. How the war started after a Dragon killed one of the royal Fae and our kind sought out revenge.If only they had known this world we currently live in would result from that war, maybe they wouldn’t have sought revenge. I noticed halfway through that there were pages torn from the middle.Sitting up, I make my way into the bathroom. I grab the towel that was hanging on the back of the chair drying, taking it with me before shutting the bathroom door.Halfway through washing my hair, I feel a draft blow into the room. Turning around I look toward the door.Before spinning back around trying to cover myself. Dragus is standing in the doorway, watching me. He was wearing faded denim jeans and a black singlet with a devious smile on his lips and I noticed Matitus sitting expressionless on the end of the bed behind him, also staring at me.Reaching over to the basin with my back to them, I try to reach for the towel when it is suddenly gone.",1,1751357361.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1low1zh,https://i.redd.it/8xrk9uqg08af1.jpeg,My living room setup,"Hey everyone here’s my setup for tv, movies, and listening. The room is about 3m deep from the speakers, which is filled with a large right angle couch. Artie (my pup) is for added sound absorption.  

Amp: Sansui AU-417
DAC: Topping E30ii
Speakers: Tannoy DTM-8
Stands: There actually coffee tables from TAF Studio. Was looking for a stand which was height adjustable and provided decent isolation from the ground. They’re solid metal and weigh about 10kg each. 

Next steps: 
1. Most immediate upgrade will be restoring my amp with new caps and trans. 

2. I’m thinking of adding a preamp into my line between my DAC and Amp. I’m interested in playing with tubes so considering the Yaqin MS-23B

Tapos nagchat ako sa grab rider to tell him where i was and my friend saw i call the rider “sir” and he was like “wow professional naman” para daw nasa work setting ako and i just joked “para mabait sa akin haha” but honestly i just call working people sir/ma’am kasi nasanay na ako lol. Tapos nag comment ang friend ko saying na “nagti-tip ka ba sa riders?” and i said no kasi ang alam ko hindi naman siya required. Sabi ni friend “wow ang sama haha ako kasi nagti-tip mga 30 pesos ganon depende sa order ko tapos mabait sila sa akin”.

I was baffled. So i need to tip pa para lang maging mabait yung mga riders sa akin?? Hindi naman siya required and it’s good if you tip. Yung tip ko nalang minsan mga 5 pesos if 125 ang total ko and i gave 130 pesos. Pero never akong nag tip talaga ng malaki. Hearing him say na ang sama ko daw kasi hindi ako nagtitip kahit na sinabi ko na mga 5 pesos lang natitip ko made me feel like a bad person.

I started deficit in April from 90kg with around 1800kcal target, every 3-4kgs I'd calculate my TDEE and reevaluate my intake. Currently I'm aiming for 1600-1700kcal daily. I don't really know how to judge my activity level - there are days where I can't really fit anything over 6k steps and there are days where I do almost 15k easily. According to Apple Health my average is around 8k. To keep myself sane I allow myself once in a week or two to grab a meal from fast food but always try to get healthiest option out there (for example - I'm never taking sugary soda, only sugar-free options, or kebab with chicken only instead of more fatty red meat). I'm also using 700ml water bottle, to keep track of how much water I drink, and I average on around 3-4 of these daily + can of sugar-free soda (I have sweet tooth and whenever I tried dieting without anything sweet, it ended up with me being heavier than starting weight) + cup of coffee with \~150ml soy milk in the morning.

Sadly weight loss trend suddenly stopped at my current weight: [https://imgur.com/a/j30G6yq](https://imgur.com/a/j30G6yq) This stagnation has been like this for 2 weeks now and I don't really know how to progress further.

I currently have this FWB and I really want to please him and I’d like to give him some even bigger loads and sometimes I worry about the taste too although he or others have never said anything.

What are your advice for bigger and nice tasting loads? Also what’s your optimal wait time as I think after a while it doesn’t make much difference. For me best wait seems to be at least 4 days but not more than 7.

So far I’ve come across: a healthier diet, being hydrated (something I need to work on as a heavy coffee drinker)… From experience drinking just one beer also means my load is a lot sweeter, some guys have commented on that.

I recently stopped masturbating and it’s changed my sex life. I tend to hookup with a guy twice a week, sometimes once and it means my cock is a lot more sensitive when I’m sucked and especially when I fuck since I don’t shoot my load in between but it has also meant some massive loads at times which the bottoms I hook up with always comment on.

I also exercise more and especially do some cardio which has made a difference.

I also find that not cuming isn’t enough, I get my biggest loads when I edge myself in between hook ups (there was that one time when I had edged myself so much I ended up leaking a massive load of precum in a guy’s mouth which he loved).

""Fifty million, leaving the country within a week, leaving my son forever.""

Brianna Wiggins sat across from Gretchen Belton, her well-maintained face showing no hidden contempt.

If it were in the past, Gretchen would definitely have retorted with tears in her eyes, ""I wasn't with him for the money.""

Now, she just nodded calmly and said, ""Okay.""

Brianna paused for a moment, then smirked, ""At least she knows her place.""

She emphasized the ""self-awareness"" heavily, as if highlighting the vast difference in identity between her and Howard Wiggins.

Gretchen looked down and didn't say anything, took the check, and then turned and left.

When she got back to the villa, it was already dark.

It's too big here, so big that she often gets lost.

The only familiar thing was the photo on the coffee table. In the picture, Howard had his arm around her waist, looking down at her with eyes so gentle they could melt the snow of winter.

She gently touched the photo, suddenly remembering that rainy night three years ago.

That year, she found Howard at the end of the alley, covered in blood and with a vacant look in his eyes.

""Who are you?"" she asked him.

""I... don't remember."" He shook his head blankly, rain mixed with blood dripping from his hair.

And so, she brought the amnesiac man back home.

The old shabby apartment, only thirty square meters, was cramped for the two of them.

The wall was peeling, the pipes were leaking, and she had to use three blankets to keep warm in winter.

It's just in this poorest place that the purest love was born.

They relied on each other and became each other's everything from then on.

He waited downstairs for three hours while she was working overtime, just to walk her home.

When she was sweating and in pain during her period, I stayed up all night massaging her stomach.

He worked five jobs in secret for a day, just to buy her an expensive necklace that she couldn't bear to buy after looking at it three times.

The only thing that she couldn't stand was that he would cling to her every night.

She blushed and begged for mercy, he chuckled lowly while biting her earlobe, ""Baby, only because I love you so much.""

The year they loved each other the most, he even took her to a tattoo shop and got her name tattooed on his collarbone.

The tattoo artist asked him if he was afraid of pain, but he just looked at her and smiled, ""Pain is good, that way you won't forget the person you love the most.""

She thought they would be happy forever.

Until he recovered his memory.

She just found out that, turns out, he wasn't a poor guy wandering the streets, but the prince of the Wiggins family in Yaclax, the heir to half of the financial circle, back then, he was just set up by his archenemy, causing him to have amnesia from a car accident and end up on the streets.

After recovering his identity, Howard moved into a 2,000-square-foot mansion with Gretchen. The bathroom alone was ten times bigger than her original home.

But he, from then on, seemed like a different person.

He wore a designer suit that she couldn't even recognize, a priceless watch, talked about multi-million dollar deals, and didn't come home all night.

She was fooling herself, ""He was just too busy.""

Until that day, entertainment headlines were filled with rumors about him and the Crawley Group heiress Veronica Crawley.

In the photo, he was wearing a designer suit, opening the car door for her, and they were smiling at each other, which made her eyes hurt.

The comments section is all talking about ""marrying someone from the same background"" and ""a match made in heaven.""

At that moment, she sat alone by the window, staring at the moon all night, and finally realized a fact.

That Howard who used to pick her up from work in the snow, buy her necklaces with his hard-earned money, and tattoo her name on his collarbone, died on the day he regained his memory.

The Wiggins family's son is like night and day compared to her.

He stood on the cloud, she was stuck in the mud.

Just like the moon can never reach the dust, a person like him is destined to be with someone equally dazzling.

If so, why did she bring it on herself?

Let it go.

Let him go, let yourself go.

That night, the villa was still empty, Howard still hadn't returned.

Gretchen didn't wait up for him until the early hours like she used to. Instead, she went to bed early and then headed to the visa center as soon as it was light out.

She went through the express lane, and her visa and passport were ready within a week.

When Gretchen walked out of the visa center, it was already noon. She randomly picked a restaurant.

The moment she pushed the door open, her footsteps hesitated slightly.

Sitting by the window, Howard was gently wiping Veronica's mouth with a tissue.

That look was so gentle that it could melt the ice in the coldest winter, just like when we used to kiss and laugh together in the rented room.

Gretchen stood there, feeling like her heart was being squeezed by an invisible hand.

She turned around to leave, but accidentally knocked over the potted plant by the door.

Howard looked up when he heard a sound and saw Gretchen, the warmth in his eyes fading instantly.

He walked slowly towards her, his thin lips slightly parted, his voice low and cold: ""Are you following me?""

Before I could even speak, he said again, ""I've already explained to you about those online rumors, it's just about business cooperation. How long are you going to keep making a fuss?""

Gretchen opened her mouth to explain, but her throat felt like it was stuffed with cotton.

Brianna's words from yesterday are still ringing in my ears: ""Howard and Veronica's marriage was arranged by their families long ago, and he really likes Veronica himself...""

Is it the kind of cooperation that is like a marriage?

""Howard, don't be so mean."" Veronica also walked over, smiling and trying to smooth things over, ""It's fate that we met, let's sit together.""

Before Gretchen could refuse, Veronica just dragged her to their table.

Gretchen was pinned to the chair like a puppet, facing Howard's icy face.

""What does Ms. Belton want to eat?"" Veronica pushed the menu in front of her, ""The French cuisine here is very authentic.""

Gretchen stared at the French words on the menu that she couldn't understand at all, feeling embarrassed and awkward.

""I wasn't hungry,"" she pushed the menu away.

""Have some soup."" Veronica served a bowl of seafood soup in front of her. ""It's very fresh.""

Gretchen stared at the shrimp floating in the soup, her stomach twisting in pain.

She was seriously allergic to seafood.

Just as she was about to politely decline, Howard's phone rang.

He got up to answer the phone, his back straight like a pine tree.

She had seen that suit in a magazine before, enough to buy the whole neighborhood she used to live in.

""Give it a try."" Veronica suddenly lowered her voice, ""After all, with your status, you don't usually get to eat such expensive dishes.""

Gretchen suddenly looked up and met her smiling eyes.

""Do you really think that just because you had a fling with Howard, you can marry into a wealthy family?"" She tapped her fingers lightly on the edge of the cup, ""If it weren't for his amnesia, a low-class woman like you wouldn't even be worthy of shining his shoes.""

Gretchen clenched the napkin, the fabric crumpled in her palm.

She was poor, but that didn't give anyone the right to trample on her dignity like that. ""Ms. Crawley, we don't know each other, but you...""

""Oh no!""

Just as she was halfway through her sentence, Veronica suddenly screamed and accidentally knocked over the bowl of seafood soup, the scalding liquid splashing onto the back of her hand and splattering all over Gretchen's hands.

Howard turned back at the sound, his long fingers immediately gripping Veronica's hand. ""What's wrong?""

""It's nothing..."" Veronica's eyes were red and swollen, ""It's all my fault. Being caught having dinner alone with you, Ms. Belton as your girlfriend, she saw it and got angry. It's understandable...""

Howard immediately looked at Gretchen, with a cold expression on his face, ""Gretchen, I've explained it countless times, do you have to be like this?""

""I didn't, it was her own...""

""That's enough!"" he interrupted her, ""I saw it with my own eyes, how can it be fake? When did you become so unreasonable?""

After saying that, Howard just walked away without looking back, holding Veronica's head.

Veronica was leaning on his shoulder, slowly turned her head, and gave Gretchen a victorious smile.

Gretchen stood there, trembling, and reached out her hands, which were burned red.

The blister had already formed, hurting like a million needles poking.

In Howard's eyes, there was only that small patch of slightly red skin on Veronica.

He left so quickly, so decisively, didn't even give her a glance.

Howard could clearly see that she was the most caring.

Three years ago when she burned herself while cooking, he was so worried that his eyes turned red. He rushed to the pharmacy in the middle of the night to buy medicine. When he came back, he applied the medicine to her wound and asked, ""Grete, does it hurt?""

Back then, his eyes were all on her.

Now Howard can't see her anymore.

# Chapter 2

Gretchen went home.

When she got back, she dug out the first aid kit in the living room and did the disinfection, medication, and bandaging by herself.

The wound tingled with a sharp pain, like a bunch of ants gnawing at it.

Turning around and going upstairs, she accidentally caught sight of the grand piano in the corner of the living room.

That was bought by Howard after he regained his memory, saying he wanted to teach her how to play the piano.

But it's been so long, the dust has accumulated thickly on the piano cover.

Just like their relationship, it had long been covered in dust.

She turned red eyes, and started to quickly pack her luggage into the room.

She sorted out her clothes, documents, bank cards... one by one, moving very slowly, as if saying goodbye to her past self.

Halfway through tidying up, the door was suddenly pushed open.

Howard stood at the door, suit jacket draped over his arm, tie loose.

He saw her open suitcase and frowned, ""What are you doing?""

""Gather your things,"" Gretchen calmly replied, continuously bending down to fold clothes.

Howard frowned and approached, with a hint of perfume on him, the one Veronica used today.

He grabbed her wrist so hard that it made her frown in pain.

""Just because I had dinner with Veronica today, you want to run away from home? You hurt someone, Veronica didn't even argue with you, and you're the one throwing a tantrum?""

Gretchen looked up at him, the man's irritation was written all over his face.

""Veronica and I are old friends. She just returned to her home country, and her parents asked me to take care of her more. Can't you be more understanding?""

Mature?

The word ""stabbed into her heart like a knife,"" Gretchen clenched the clothes in her hand, the fabric crumpled in her palm.

She was already mature enough to leave, how much more mature does she need to be?

""Speak up!"" Howard suddenly raised his voice.

Gretchen turned around silently and continued packing her bags.

Her silence totally pissed off Howard.

""Fine, let's see how long you can keep this up.""

After saying that, he slammed the door and it ""bang"" shut, making her heart tremble.

The next morning, when Gretchen went downstairs, she saw Veronica sitting in the living room, chatting with Howard and smiling.

She wore a white dress today, with delicate makeup, looking pure and elegant.

Seeing Gretchen coming down, she immediately stood up, smiling sweetly and innocently, ""Ms. Belton, you're awake? My parents insisted that Howard take me to the auction today, don't think too much about it.""

Gretchen glanced at Howard, the man was busy fixing his cufflinks, didn't even give her a look.

""I didn't think much,"" she said softly, ""Your business has nothing to do with me.""

Howard's hand paused, his brow furrowing even tighter.

He was about to speak when Veronica cut in, saying, ""Why don't we invite Ms. Belton to come along? Since you don't have anything else to do anyway.""

Before Gretchen could refuse, Veronica had already affectionately linked her arm.

She was just pulled into the car like that.

The auction was lit up with bright lights, and it was packed with celebrities.

Howard sat in the front row, casually holding up signs with his slender fingers. He snapped up one piece of jewelry and luxury watch after another, then handed them over to Veronica beside him.

Veronica laughed gently, whispering in his ear from time to time, her affectionate gestures were dazzling.

""Howard, should we get some for Ms. Belton too?"" she suggested, pretending to be considerate.

Howard said casually, ""No, she's not used to these things.""

Veronica heard that, with a slight smile on her lips, she gave Howard a victorious smile from an angle he couldn't see.

Gretchen looked down, gently rubbing the auction catalog in her hand, feeling a chill in her heart.

Can't get used to it, or don't deserve it?

In his eyes, she was probably always the Cinderella who crawled out of the slums, even though she is standing next to him now, deep down she still doesn't match these luxurious things.

It's okay, anyway... before long, there won't be any relationship between them anymore.

Gretchen sat quietly in the corner, watching Howard shower Veronica with money, watching their intimate display as if she was just a bystander.

Until the last item was presented---

A jade bracelet.

Her breath caught in her throat, and her fingers clenched involuntarily.

That was grandma's keepsake!

Three years ago, Howard went to the construction site to move bricks in order to buy her a birthday gift. In the end, he fell from the site and almost lost his life.

To raise money for his surgery, she had to sell the bracelet her grandmother left her.

Later, when she had saved enough money to redeem it, the bracelet had already been bought by someone else.

She searched all the antique shops in town, but never saw it again.

And now, it just appeared in front of her out of the blue.

Gretchen's heart skipped a beat, and she almost instinctively raised the sign.

""One million.""

Veronica turned around and looked at her in surprise, then chuckled lightly and held up a sign, ""Three million.""

""Four million!""

""Five million!""

\*\*\*

After several rounds of bidding back and forth, Howard frowned and glanced between Gretchen and Veronica.

In the end, he raised his hand slightly and lit the sky lantern.

Bought at the highest price of the whole auction.

The auctioneer sealed the deal with a hammer: ""Congratulations, Mr. Wiggins!""

Amidst the uproar, he turned to Veronica and said, ""Since you like it, it's yours.""

The number plate in Gretchen's hand ""plopped"" onto the ground.

# Chapter 3

She stared blankly as the staff respectfully handed the bracelet to Veronica, who was smiling and reaching out to take it. Just as her fingertips touched the edge of the box, she suddenly exclaimed, ""Oops!""

""Bang!""

The jade bracelet slipped from the box and fell heavily onto the marble floor, breaking into two pieces.

At that moment, Gretchen's breath almost stopped, and all she could hear was the sharp sound of shattering.

Her mind went blank, and almost instinctively she rushed forward, pushing Veronica aside and trembling as she picked up the pieces on the ground.

Howard's face turned cold, he grabbed the staggering Veronica, and looked at Gretchen again, his voice low and stern, ""Gretchen, what are you doing?""

Gretchen looked up with red eyes, her voice trembling, ""What am I doing? This is my grandmother's heirloom! Didn't you say before that if you ever saw it again, you would definitely buy it back?""

""But now you don't even remember, right?""

Howard paused for a moment, as if remembering something, but quickly his expression turned cold again.

""How could I still remember something that happened so long ago?"" he said coldly, with a hint of anger. ""Besides, Veronica didn't do it on purpose. How could you just push someone like that?""

Veronica's eyes turned red, she pitifully tugged at his sleeve, saying, ""I'm sorry, it's all my fault...""

Howard furrowed his brow, wiped away her tears with his hand, and said in a low voice, ""It's none of your business.""

After saying that, he gave Gretchen a cold glance and said firmly, ""I will have someone fix this bracelet, so stop making a fuss.""

As soon as the words were spoken, he grabbed Veronica's shoulder, took the two broken bracelets, and left without looking back.

Gretchen stood there, watching their backs as they walked away, her heart feeling like it had been ripped out, hurting so much she could barely breathe.

When the auction ended, it was already raining outside.

Gretchen stood at the entrance of the venue, watching Howard's black Maybach drive away with Veronica.

The venue was quite remote, she waited for thirty minutes but couldn't hail a cab, so she had to walk back in the rain.

When she got home, her feet were so sore that she couldn't feel them anymore.

When she took off her high heels, the blister burst, sticking to her stockings, and she sucked in a breath of cold air in pain.

She was lying on the sofa, staring at the ceiling in a daze.

Suddenly remembered that rainy night a few years ago, Howard carried her three kilometers to the hospital.

Back then, he was so broke that he couldn't even afford a taxi, but he stubbornly refused to let her get out and walk a single step.

""Grete, hold on a little longer, we're almost there.""

His back was so warm, the rain hitting her felt sweet too.

What about now? He was driving a luxury car worth millions, but he wouldn't even wait five minutes for her.

She took the medicine, then buried herself under the covers, and fell asleep.

She didn't dare to think about recent events. Just thinking about it, all the sour grievances and pain would come flooding in.

No one knew, what she wanted was never the prince Yaclax Howard, she just wanted that Howard who squeezed with her in the shabby rental house, would laugh and call her Grete.

But he ""died"", and he can never come back.

She closed her eyes and let the tears flow.

The next day at noon, she was woken up by the sound of the door opening.

Howard stood by the bed, looking sharp in his suit.

""There was a family banquet in the evening, you went with me.""

# Chapter 4

""I didn't want him to notice anything unusual before I left, in case something happened,"" Gretchen remained silent for a moment, then nodded.

After that, I got up and went to the closet to pick out clothes, my ankle hurting.

Half an hour later, the two of them arrived at their destination.

The Wiggins' villa was brightly lit. When Gretchen followed Howard through the door, the first thing she saw was Veronica sitting on the sofa.

She was wearing an elegant Chanel suit, chatting intimately with Brianna, while Edwin Wiggins nodded and smiled on the side, creating a harmonious scene.

""Howard is here!"" Brianna greeted enthusiastically, completely ignoring Gretchen, and went straight to grab her son's arm, ""Veronica has been waiting for you for a long time.""

Howard paused for a moment, then instinctively glanced back at Gretchen.

He thought he would see her look of grievance, or at least a forced expression of sadness, but Gretchen just stood calmly on the side, as if all of this had nothing to do with her.

""Ms. Belton also came?"" Veronica pretended to be surprised, then smiled gently, ""Please have a seat, don't be shy.""

Brianna glanced at Gretchen and said coldly, ""Since you're here, just behave yourself and don't embarrass our family.""

Gretchen remained silent.

At the dinner table, Brianna and Veronica were gossiping about the socialite circle, Edwin and Howard were discussing company projects, and no one was talking to Gretchen.

She was like a ghost, quietly eating her food, with Brianna's sarcastic remarks ringing in her ears.

""Having similar backgrounds is really important.""

""Some girls, they just lack self-awareness.""

""Veronica and Howard grew up together since they were kids, they know each other inside out, a perfect match.""

Gretchen heard these words too many times.

At first, Howard used to interrupt with a cold face, then he just frowned and said, ""Mom, stop talking."" And now—

He didn't even frown.

Gretchen lowered her head and drank the soup. The hot soup slid down her throat, but it couldn't warm her cold heart.

After dinner, Howard drove them back home.

Veronica naturally sat in the passenger seat, Gretchen sat alone in the back seat.

In the car, there was Veronica's favorite song playing. She was smiling and discussing the dinner with Howard.

Gretchen looked at the blurry neon lights outside the window, suddenly remembered that winter, Howard rode a second-hand bicycle to take her home, she hugged his waist, and put her frozen hands in his coat pocket.

""Grete, when I had money, I would definitely buy a good car and never let you freeze again.""

Now he does have money, but it's not her sitting in the passenger seat.

The blinding headlights suddenly shone over, she didn't react in time, and then saw a truck out of control rushing towards them.

""Bang!""

In a loud crash, Gretchen saw Howard jump towards the passenger seat without hesitation, using his body to shield Veronica.

And she, was thrown forward by inertia, her forehead hitting the windshield, blood instantly blurring her vision.

In the last second before consciousness faded, she clearly heard the sound of her heart breaking.

Originally, even at a critical moment of life and death, he now no longer chooses her.

\*\*\*

When she woke up again, Gretchen found herself lying in a hospital bed.

The wound on her forehead was already bandaged, and the old injury on her ankle got worse. She was in so much pain that she couldn't move.

She stood up straight, the door of the ward was pushed open, Brianna walked in wearing high heels.

""Gretchen, didn't I tell you to go abroad?"" She looked down at Gretchen, her eyes full of disdain. ""You're still here, still dreaming of marrying into the Wiggins family?""

Gretchen looked at her calmly and said, ""No, the paperwork isn't done yet. Don't worry, as soon as the visa is approved, I'll leave immediately.""

She paused, ""She walked far away, he could never find her.""

Brianna sneered, ""Hope you walk the talk.""

As soon as the words fell, the door of the ward was pushed open again.

Howard stood at the door, looking gloomy. ""Leaving? Who's leaving?""

# Chapter 5

Gretchen lowered her eyelashes and lied, ""My aunt came to visit me, I told her I was fine and asked her to leave first.""

Brianna saw the situation and quickly pretended to care for a few words, then made an excuse and left.

There were only the two of them left in the ward.

""Before that..."" Howard walked to the edge of the bed, his voice a bit stiff, ""The car accident was so sudden, I didn't react in time.""

Gretchen lightly nodded and said, ""I know, it's okay.""

Howard paused for a moment and asked, ""Aren't you angry?""

""Don't be angry.""

Howard stared into her eyes, trying to find a trace of grievance or anger, but her gaze was as calm as still water.

He suddenly got a little annoyed, reached out to touch her face, ""Don't be angry, I...""

""I'm not really angry,"" Gretchen said, turning her head to avoid his touch, her tone light but firm, ""I want to rest. Ms. Crawley is also injured, so go and keep her company.""

After saying that, she closed her eyes and turned around.

She felt like Howard had been watching her by the bed for a long time, and finally, he left and closed the door.

In the following days, Howard would come every day.

He sat by the hospital bed dealing with documents, occasionally asking her, ""Does it hurt?"" She always shook her head.

But whenever she fell asleep and woke up again, there was always no one by her bedside, only nurses whispering.

""Ms. Crawley's boyfriend in the VIP ward next door is really nice, he stayed with her all night.""

""I heard he's still the heir of the Wiggins Group, good-looking and loyal.""

Gretchen closed her eyes, pretending not to hear.

On the day she was discharged, Howard personally came to pick her up.

Gretchen dragged her still-sore ankle to the front of the car, but froze when she tried to open the door.

Veronica sat in the passenger seat and gave her a gentle smile, ""Ms. Belton, do you mind if I catch a ride with you? I get a bit car sick, so I have to sit in the front seat.""

Howard frowned, as if wanting to explain something, but Gretchen cut in first, saying, ""It's okay.""

She calmly sat in the back seat, watching the backs of the two people in front of her like an outsider.

Howard glanced at her through the rearview mirror, hesitated to speak, and in the end, didn't say anything.

The car stopped in front of a luxurious villa, and Gretchen realized that Howard didn't take her home, but instead brought her to attend a prestigious elder's golden wedding anniversary party in the circle.

""Isn't that Mr. Wiggins? Why is he with two ladies?""

""Isn't that Gretchen in the white dress? I heard she came from the slums, her family was really average.""

""Ms. Crawley and Mr. Wiggins were a perfect match, they were a good fit.""

The guests were talking loudly, but Gretchen just stood quietly in the corner as if she hadn't heard anything.

Howard was with Veronica the whole time, getting her drinks, putting on her coat, and looking at her with eyes so gentle it was like they could drip water.

""Ms. Belton, I'll introduce you to some friends."" Veronica suddenly walked over and affectionately linked arms with Gretchen.

Gretchen didn't have time to refuse, she was pulled in front of a group of socialites.

""This is Gretchen, Howard's... girlfriend.""

Veronica introduced with a smile, then suddenly switched to fluent German, chatting with some socialites.

A few people were stunned for a moment, then quickly caught on and started chatting in German, occasionally bursting into laughter.

Gretchen stood there like a lonely island, isolated beyond the high walls of language.

""Ms. Belton?"" Veronica suddenly asked her, ""What do you think?""

""What?""

""Oh, sorry, I forgot you don't speak German anymore,"" Veronica apologized, turning to explain to the others, ""Ms. Belton never learned a foreign language, so don't mind her.""

A few light laughs rang out around, like tiny silver needles, poking into Gretchen's skin.

""It's okay, just take your time,"" Veronica patted Gretchen's hand, speaking gently as if comforting a child with special needs.

Gretchen looked down, her nails digging deep into the palm of her hand.

In the eyes of others, either mocking or pitying, she felt like a clown stripped naked for all to see, every breath like swallowing shards of glass.

# Chapter 6

Just then, the host announced a little game.

The couple performed piano duet on stage, and the best performer will receive a set of precious jewelry as a bonus.

""That jewelry set is so beautiful!"" Veronica's eyes lit up, she grabbed Howard's sleeve and coquettishly said, ""Howard, my birthday is coming up soon, can you and Ms. Belton help me win it back?""

The socialites around immediately laughed, ""Veronica, are you trying to embarrass people? Ms. Belton doesn't even know German, how could she play the piano, such a high society thing?""

""Someone suggested, 'Why don't you perform with Mr. Wiggins?'""

Veronica looked at Howard and asked, ""Is it okay?""

Howard nodded slightly and said, ""Sure.""

Veronica glanced at Gretchen smugly and said, ""Well, I'll just borrow Howard for a while.""

The moment they walked onto the stage and the music started playing, the whole audience fell silent.

Veronica's fingertips danced on the piano keys, Howard seamlessly complementing her as if they were the perfect couple in sync.

The guests were amazed, and Gretchen in the audience was surrounded by Veronica's friends.

""Gretchen, did you see that? That's a perfect match, you can't even speak German or play the piano, how can you deserve to be with the Wiggins family's son? If you have any sense, just leave on your own.""

""I heard you used to live in the slums on the west side of town, that kind of rundown place, people actually live there? No wonder you smell so poor.""

""A poor girl, dreaming of becoming a phoenix on a branch? Don't embarrass yourself.""

The grating laughter stabbed into my ears like shards of glass.

Gretchen clenched her skirt and turned to leave, but someone deliberately tripped her.

She fell heavily to the ground, a sharp pain instantly engulfing her whole body.

Before she could even catch her breath, a red high-heeled shoe stepped on her wrist.

""Oops, sorry."" She pretended to be surprised, maliciously grinding the heel of her shoe back and forth on her toes, ""Didn't see you there.""

""A crisp sound of 'click'.""

Gretchen was in so much pain that she saw white in front of her eyes, instinctively looking up at Howard in front of the piano.

She opened her mouth, but couldn't make a sound, so she could only helplessly seek help with her eyes.

Howard did glance over here.

Just a glance.

Then, he just looked away like he saw a stranger, and went back to focusing on flipping through the sheet music for Veronica.

Gretchen bit her lip hard, trying not to cry out loud.

She remembered three years ago, when she accidentally cut her finger while working at the supermarket, Howard was so worried that he left work early and rushed over, he even dragged her to the clinic to get it bandaged.

The doctors all said ""No need to treat the small wound,"" but he stubbornly stayed by her side all night, afraid she might get a fever and infection.

Now, she had her hand bones broken by life, but he didn't even spare her a glance.

Howard and Veronica shared a smile, like a prince and princess in a fairy tale.

""Ugh!""

The sharp heel crushed down again, and Gretchen clearly heard the crisp sound of her wrist bones breaking.

The excruciating pain flooded through every nerve like a tidal wave, and my vision started to blur and distort.

At the last moment before falling into darkness, she heard the piano piece end, and the applause thundered.

\*\*\*

When Gretchen woke up, the hospital room was filled with the smell of disinfectant.

The doctor was explaining to Howard, ""Mr. Wiggins, Ms. Belton has a comminuted fracture of the wrist bone, even if it heals, there will be permanent damage, she won't be able to lift heavy objects anymore, her fingers will be connected, she will be in pain and unable to sleep at night for the next month, make sure to have someone take good care of her.""

Gretchen's face turned pale all of a sudden.

She subconsciously raised her wrist, wanting to reach for the water cup on the bedside, but the sharp pain in her wrist made her accidentally knock it over.

""Plop-""

The sound of glass shattering made the doctor and Howard turn around at the same time.

After the doctor sighed and left, Howard quickly walked to the bedside and poured her another glass of water.

After handing it to her, he furrowed his brows, cleared his throat a few times before saying, ""Sorry, I was playing the piano at that time and didn't see you fall. Are you hurt?""

Gretchen looked at his face, and the first thing that came to mind was how he used to gaze tenderly at Veronica in front of the piano.

Was he just not seeing it, or did he simply not care?

She slowly closed her eyes, trying to suppress the pain in her heart, and said word by word, ""I'm going to call the police.""

Howard was taken aback: ""What?""

""Didn't you hear what the doctor just said?"" Gretchen raised her casted hand, her eyes red but stubbornly holding back tears. ""My hand is ruined, shouldn't those people pay for it?""

Howard's expression became complicated, ""You just can't lift heavy things anymore, it's not like before. With me around, you don't have to do those rough jobs anymore.""

He paused, ""They are all Veronica's friends. If you pursue this, Veronica will be embarrassed. Do we have to make such a big deal out of this?""

# Chapter 7

Gretchen bit her lip so hard that she tasted blood.

So, just to avoid embarrassing Veronica, does she have to swallow all this pain alive?

""I had to call the police.""

Howard was silent for a moment, then suddenly took out his checkbook and said, ""Since you insist on pursuing this, I'll compensate for them.""

The sound of the pen scratching the check was especially clear in the ward, each one felt like a torture to Gretchen's heart.

When he wrote down the first number, she bit her lip hard, the taste of blood spreading in her mouth.

He saw that she didn't answer, thought she was unhappy with the amount, tore that piece off, and wrote down a new number.

One time, two times, three times...

The amount on the check kept going up, and when that check with ""one billion"" written on it was handed to her, she suddenly remembered that rainy night three years ago.

Back then they lived in a ten-square-meter rental room. He worked overtime until 3 in the morning, came back soaking wet, but still smiled and hugged her, saying, ""Grete, I will definitely earn enough to make you never suffer again.""

The vow was fulfilled, but in this way.

He could easily make a billion, but he did it to let her off the hook from those who were stepping on her.

""Is one billion enough?"" He handed over the check again.

She took the light check tremblingly, and suddenly burst into laughter.

Smiling, tears started falling and splattered on the check, smudging the ink.

""That's enough,"" her voice sounded hoarse, not like herself. ""Howard, your promise from years ago, has finally been fulfilled.""

He paused for a moment, furrowed his brow, seemed like he didn't understand what she was saying.

How could he understand?

That Howard who used to hold her tightly in the rental house and said he would make a billion to give her a good life, he's long gone.

He died clean, not a trace left behind.

After that day, Howard never came to the hospital again.

But every morning at ten o'clock, his assistant would always come in on time, carrying a beautifully packaged supplement gift box.

Sent in various ways.

""Mr. Wiggins asked me to tell you that he's been really busy with work lately,"" the assistant stood by the bed, speaking respectfully yet distantly, ""Wishing you a speedy recovery.""

Gretchen nodded, her eyes landing on the unopened supplements on the bedside table.

The gold foil logo on the packaging was shining in the sunlight, just like Howard's life was now dazzling and eye-catching.

After the assistant left, she opened her phone and saw that Veronica's Instagram had been updated.

In the photo, she was leaning on Howard's shoulder, with the blue sea and sky of Fracia in the background.

The caption is: ""Thanks to someone for taking time out of their busy schedule to accompany me\~""

She stared at the photo for a long, long time, until her eyes got sore.

He was ""too busy"" to go on vacation with Veronica to France.

Just as I was about to turn off my phone, a text message suddenly popped up.

""Dear Ms. Belton, your visa application has been approved. Your passport will be ready tomorrow. Please bring your original ID card to collect it during office hours.""

Gretchen read it three times and suddenly burst out laughing.

As I was laughing, tears started falling down and landed on the phone screen, blurring the words ""approved for review.""

Finally, everything was coming to an end.

She doesn't have to count the seconds waiting for him to come home anymore, doesn't have to swallow the cold dinner alone in the late night, doesn't have to endure Brianna's contemptuous gaze.

The most important thing is—

Finally, I can let go of that me who was holding onto memories while feeling pain.

The next day at noon, Gretchen checked out of the hospital and then rushed to the visa center to pick up her passport and plane ticket.

When she got back to the villa, she saw Howard and Veronica chatting in the living room, while the bodyguard was carrying luggage to the guest room.

When she came back, both of them looked at her together.

Howard narrowed his eyes and explained, ""Veronica's parents went on a trip abroad, she was scared to stay home alone, so she came here to stay for a while. The Wiggins family and the Crawley family are old friends, and the two families also have business dealings, so I should take care of her more.""

He didn't actually need to explain to her.

From today on, they had no relationship at all.

Gretchen nodded and went upstairs.

""Oh, by the way,"" Veronica suddenly stopped her, ""there's a musical later, Howard and I are planning to go together. Would Ms. Belton like to join us?""

Before Gretchen could speak, Howard answered for her, ""She still has injuries on her hands, so she should rest at home. Besides, she can't understand these things anyway.""

Gretchen stopped and turned around with a faint smile, ""Yeah, I couldn't understand it.""

Not long after they left, Gretchen's luggage was also packed.

She stood in the center of the bedroom, looking around at the room that used to hold so many of her hopes and dreams, now just a barren wasteland.

The photo of Howard on the coffee table still, with a gentle look in her eyes, as if she was the only one in the world.

Gretchen gently stroked the frame, then turned it upside down on the table.

She walked to the door, left the keys on the cabinet in the hallway, and then gently closed the door. ""Three years ago on that stormy night, she found a boy covered in blood at the end of the alley, like picking up a fallen star. Today, three years later, she quietly left with her luggage, the lights of the villa behind her gradually dimming, as if that star had never shone in her life.""",1,1751356634.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1lovvt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorwayTravelAdvice/comments/1lovvt8/shipping_parcels_to_leknes/,Shipping parcels to Leknes?,"Hello, me and my beloved have arranged a trip (21.7.) to the Lofoten archipelago, and we'll be taking the bus from Evenes airport and staying in Leknes on our first day. We have mostly everything planned out but we overlooked our airlines (Lufthansa) strict policy on gas stoves and gas cartridges, which are a no go. We also can't bring MRE's onboard as they contain flammable calcium carbide. We'll be hiking across most of the archipelago and supply points, shops and restaurants are sometimes days apart and going days without a proper warm meal or being able to cook coffee would be agony. 

So my question is whether it's possible to order said supplies online and have them delivered to a post office or parcel drop box (if they are available in Leknes) and then picked up. Being able to ship most non perishable foods like mre's, protein/energy bars and cooking equipment would also save us a ton of heavy luggage we wont have to haul around the airports and buses all day (we'll be hauling it anyway for the next week 😆)

Any insight and advice is highly appreciated, Thank You.

I vividly remember my mum dragging me around to peoples houses in the 80s/90s and their living rooms would be filled with rails and rails of clothes in those plastic protectors, and it would be full of women gassing and trying them on and making orders. I also remember going to one which was full of boxed toys and being furious that I couldn’t open and play with any of them. 

Anyway, I mentioned it and my friend looked at me like I’d just landed, and is convinced that I’m either mistaken, or it was just something niche that my mother knew about. But I always assumed it was a super common thing that everyone did/knew about, and now she’s got me second guessing myself. 

So does anyone else remember these? Do they still occur? We didn’t have a lot of money back then, so maybe it was more of a working class type of thing? In my head I feel like it’s related to old catalogues like Kay’s and Grattan, but I may be making that up, I’m not sure.

For three excruciating years, I was Olivia Prescott, the dutiful, silent wife in a cold, pre-arranged marriage, foolishly loving a man who only saw his college sweetheart, Chloe.  
  
My unspoken devotion and tireless efforts to manage his life and our opulent home were met with blatant neglect and emotional indifference.  
  
The breaking point arrived not with a bang, but a searing lash and a crumpled heirloom: my grandmother's cherished cashmere shawl, deliberately ruined by Chloe, then callously dismissed by Ethan as ""just a piece of cloth.""  
  
He publicly humiliated me, forcing a humiliating apology for an ""accident"" that was anything but.  
  
That same night, his formidable mother Eleanor, enraged by my perceived defiance, wielded a riding crop, physically assaulting me.  
  
While she beat me, her son laughed softly on the phone with his beloved, utterly oblivious to the cruelty unfolding just feet away.  
  
How could I have been so blind, so foolishly hopeful, to believe love could blossom in such a barren wasteland of contempt and betrayal?  
  
My heart, once foolishly hopeful, turned to stone, burning with a quiet fury that day.  
  
With divorce papers signed and a decade of unrequited love finally extinguished, I walked out of the Prescott mansion.  
  
I left behind the ghost of a docile wife and stepped into the unknown, determined to rise from the ashes of my shattered life and show them precisely what a disposable woman could achieve.  
  
  
Chapter 1  
Olivia touched her phone screen. Her lawyer's name, Mr. Harrison, was lit up.  
  
""The papers are ready, Olivia,"" he said. His voice was calm, professional. ""Just like we discussed. The three-year agreement concludes next week.""  
  
""Thank you, Mr. Harrison,"" Olivia replied. Her voice was steady. ""I'll come by to sign them tomorrow morning.""  
  
A quiet click, and the call ended.  
  
Three years.  
  
Almost three years.  
  
She remembered the wedding day. Ethan Prescott, heir to the Prescott media empire, had stood beside her. He didn't smile. Not at her, anyway.  
  
He had handed her the contract right after the vows, in the limousine.  
  
""Three years, Olivia,"" he'd said, his voice cold. ""Secure my CEO position. Then we divorce. I marry Chloe.""  
  
Chloe Vance. The struggling actress he loved. The woman his mother, Eleanor Prescott, hated.  
  
Olivia had loved Ethan since their university days. A foolish, hopeful love. She signed, tears blurring the ink. She thought her devotion could change his heart.  
  
It hadn't.  
  
She walked into the kitchen. Ethan's breakfast. Black coffee, two sugars. Whole wheat toast, lightly buttered. Exactly how he liked it. She'd learned all his preferences, managed their grand New England home perfectly.  
  
He entered, already on his phone.  
  
""The charity gala is tonight,"" he said, not looking up. ""Be ready by seven.""  
  
""I'm not going, Ethan,"" Olivia said.  
  
He finally looked at her. A flicker of annoyance. ""What? Why not?""  
  
""I have other plans.""  
  
His eyes narrowed. ""Is this about Chloe? Are you jealous she'll be there?""  
  
Pain, sharp and familiar, tightened her ch\*\*t. He always assumed the worst of her, always saw Chloe as the victim.  
  
Chloe hadn't been there when they married. She had ""disappeared"" a month before, leaving Ethan frantic. He searched, he drank, his moods dark and unpredictable.  
  
One night, heavy with al\*\*hol, he had come to Olivia's room. He touched her face, his fingers tracing her lips.  
  
""Chloe,"" he'd whispered, pulling her close. ""You came back to me.""  
  
He made love to her that night, calling Chloe's name. Olivia had cried silently, her heart breaking into smaller, sharper pieces.  
  
After that, she tried harder. Cooked his favorite meals, gave him massages when he was stressed, stayed quiet and agreeable.  
  
Sometimes, he showed small kindnesses. A thank you for a well-organized dinner party. Medicine when she had a cold. His arm around her waist at a public event.  
  
Each small gesture was a spark of hope. She fanned it, naively believing it could grow into a flame.  
  
Then, six months ago, Chloe returned.  
  
Ethan's car had raced out of the driveway the moment he heard her voice on the phone. Olivia watched it go, her fragile hope shattering like glass.  
  
The dream was over. She knew it then. It was time to wake up.  
  
Suddenly, Ethan's phone rang again. His face changed, softened.  
  
""Chloe? What's wrong?"" He listened, his brow furrowed with concern. ""Her mother? Oh my God. I'll be right there.""  
  
He hung up, grabbing his keys.  
  
""Chloe's mother collapsed,"" he said, already moving towards the door. ""It's serious.""  
  
He didn't look at Olivia. He didn't ask if she was okay.  
  
As he rushed past, his shoulder knocked a vase from a side table. It crashed to the floor, porcelain shattering. Olivia flinched, a piece striking her hand.  
  
He didn't notice. He was gone.  
  
Blood welled from a small cut on her hand. She stared at it, then at the broken vase.  
  
Her phone rang. It was Ethan's assistant.  
  
""Mrs. Prescott, Mr. Prescott asked me to call. You need to come to City General Hospital. It's about Ms. Vance's mother.""  
  
Obligation. Dread. She pressed a napkin to her bleeding hand.  
  
At the hospital, the corridor smelled of antiseptic.  
  
She saw them before they saw her. Ethan held Chloe in his arms. Chloe was crying, her face buried in his ch\*\*. He st\*\*ked her hair, murmuring words of comfort.  
  
They looked like a couple, bound by love and crisis. Olivia felt like an intruder.  
  
Breathing became difficult.  
  
Ethan finally saw her. His expression was grim.  
  
""Olivia. Good, you're here."" He gently detached himself from Chloe.  
  
""Chloe's mother needs an experimental treatment,"" he said, his voice flat. ""It's expensive. Very expensive. The funds need to come from our joint marital assets. I need your signature.""  
  
He held out a document and a pen.  
  
Her money. Her family's dwindling fortune, tied up with his vast wealth. For Chloe's mother.  
  
She looked at Chloe, who offered a watery, grateful smile.  
  
Olivia signed. Her hand throbbed.  
  
As Ethan turned to rush back to Chloe, Olivia spoke, her voice barely a whisper.  
  
""Ethan, be careful with this. It's experimental. There are risks.""  
  
He didn't stop. He didn't look back. He didn't hear her.  
  
Tears welled in Olivia's eyes. He truly loved Chloe. He would move mountains for her.  
  
For Olivia, he wouldn't even turn his head.  
  
The cut on her hand stung. The pain was a dull echo of the ache in her heart.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
Olivia sat on a cold plastic chair outside the operating room. Hours passed.  
  
Ethan paced, his phone pressed to his ear, making arrangements. Chloe sat beside him, pale and tearful.  
  
Finally, Chloe looked at Olivia.  
  
""Olivia,"" she began, dabbing her eyes with a tissue. ""I'm so sorry you had to be involved in this. It's just... Ethan is so good to me. To my mother.""  
  
Her voice was soft, laced with a subtle pride.  
  
""He's always been like this,"" Chloe continued, a reminiscent smile playing on her lips. ""Remember that trip to Paris he took me on? Right after your first anniversary. He said he needed to get away, some business emergency. It was for me. He knew I was struggling.""  
  
Olivia's bl\*\*d ran cold. Ethan had told her it was a crucial Prescott International meeting. He'd forgotten their anniversary that year. He'd brought her a small, generic perfume from the airport duty-free a week later. Chloe had ""accidentally"" spilled it.  
  
""And the time he bought that little art gallery I loved?"" Chloe sighed. ""He told you it was a bad investment he was forced into, didn't he? He bought it so I could have a place to show my friends'work. He's so selfless.""  
  
Olivia remembered Ethan complaining about that ""foolish"" gallery, how he'd been cornered into buying it by an old family friend. She had felt sorry for him, for the burden.  
  
Her hand, still bandaged, tightened into a fist. Each word from Chloe was a sharp stone, bruising old memories.  
  
""He even wrote me letters,"" Chloe said, her eyes shining. ""Every week, for years. Even after you two were married. He said... he said he was just waiting. Waiting for the right time for us.""  
  
Letters. Olivia thought of Ethan's study, the locked drawer he always kept. She'd assumed it held sensitive business papers.  
  
All those late nights he spent ""working."" All those ""business trips.""  
  
Her last illusion shattered. There was nothing left.  
  
Olivia stood up abruptly. Her face was pale.  
  
""I have to go,"" she managed, her voice tight.  
  
She almost ran down the corridor, away from Chloe's soft voice, away from Ethan's oblivious devotion. Fleeing.  
  
Back at the house, she packed a single suitcase. Small, practical.  
  
The divorce papers were on her dresser. She would sign them. Soon.  
  
A few days later, Chloe posted on social media. A picture of Ethan, smiling, helping Chloe's mother into a private car, taking her to a luxury rehabilitation facility. The caption read: ""My hero, Ethan, making sure Mom gets the best care. Some angels walk among us. ❤️""  
  
Olivia looked at the photo. Ethan's smile was genuine, warm. A smile she had rarely seen directed at her.  
  
She remembered all the times she had cared for him when he was sick, the meals she'd cooked, the quiet support she'd offered. He had accepted it all as his due.  
  
Now, he was doing it all for Chloe's mother.  
  
Enough.  
  
She would take care of herself now. She would move on.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
A week later, Ethan came home unexpectedly in the afternoon.  
  
""Family dinner tonight,"" he announced, tossing his keys on the hall table. ""My parents. Be ready.""  
  
It was a command, not an invitation.  
  
The Prescott mansion was opulent, cold. Eleanor Prescott, Ethan's mother, presided over the dinner table like a queen on her throne.  
  
""Olivia, dear,"" Eleanor said, her smile thin. ""You and Ethan have been married for almost three years. Isn't it time we heard the pitter-patter of little feet?""  
  
Other relatives chimed in, their voices a chorus of expectation.  
  
""A Prescott heir is vital for the family legacy.""  
  
""You're not getting any younger, Olivia.""  
  
Ethan scoffed. ""We're not having children.""  
  
His words dropped into the conversation like ice. An awkward silence fell. Olivia felt her cheeks burn.  
  
After dinner, Eleanor summoned Olivia to her private study.  
  
""Come here, Olivia.""  
  
Ethan's phone buzzed. He glanced at it, his expression softening.  
  
""Chloe,"" he murmured, stepping away to take the call. ""Is everything alright, darling?"" His voice was gentle, concerned.  
  
Eleanor closed the study door. Her eyes were like chips of ice.  
  
""You are a disappointment, Olivia,"" Eleanor said, her voice low and venomous. ""No heir. And you barely play the part of the adoring wife. My son deserves better.""  
  
She placed a small, unlabeled bottle of pills on the polished mahogany desk.  
  
""These are fertility dr\*\*s. Start taking them. And you will be more convincing in public. If you don't, I will make sure your family's little winery in New England goes bankrupt. Is that clear?""  
  
Olivia looked at the bottle, then at Eleanor's hard face.  
  
""No,"" Olivia said, her voice quiet but firm. ""I won't take them.""  
  
Eleanor's eyes blazed. ""You dare defy me?""  
  
She slapped Olivia across the face. The sting was sharp, shocking.  
  
Then, Eleanor walked to a cabinet and took out a riding crop. Thin, leather-bound.  
  
""Perhaps a more direct approach is needed for you to understand your duties.""  
  
Olivia stood frozen as Eleanor raised the crop. She could hear Ethan's voice from the hallway, still on the phone with Chloe, laughing softly at something Chloe said.  
  
The first lash landed on Olivia's back. Pain seared through her.  
  
She bit her lip, refusing to cry out. Through the gap in the door, she could see Ethan leaning against the wall, relaxed, still talking to Chloe, oblivious to the cruelty unfolding just feet away.  
  
Another lash. And another.  
  
Her resolve hardened with each blow. She would leave. She would escape this nightmare.  
  
  
Chapter 4  
Olivia woke up in a hospital bed. A nurse was checking her vitals.  
  
""You lost consciousness, Mrs. Prescott,"" the nurse said gently. ""Severe bruising and dehydration. Your husband brought you in.""  
  
Ethan.  
  
He was sitting in a chair by the window, looking at his phone.  
  
He looked up when she stirred. ""Are you okay?"" he asked. His tone was flat, devoid of real concern.  
  
""Are you asking if I'm okay now, Ethan?"" Olivia said, her voice weak. ""Or were you concerned last night?""  
  
He frowned. ""Mother was upset. You shouldn't have provoked her.""  
  
He did offer some care then. He adjusted her pillows. He spoon-fed her some broth when the nurse brought it. He helped the nurse change the dressing on a particularly nasty welt on her arm. He even held her hand for a moment, his touch surprisingly gentle.  
  
""Rest,"" he said. ""You need to recover.""  
  
A flicker of the old, foolish hope. Maybe he did care, a little.  
  
Then, the door to her room burst open. Chloe Vance stood there, a fruit basket in her hands. Her eyes widened as she took in the scene: Ethan holding Olivia's hand.  
  
The basket crashed to the floor, fruit scattering.  
  
""Oh my God!"" Chloe cried, her hand flying to her mouth. ""Ethan! How could you? With her? While I'm so worried about my mother!""  
  
She turned and fled, sobbing dramatically.  
  
Ethan dropped Olivia's hand as if it burned him.  
  
""Chloe! Wait!""  
  
He ran after her, leaving Olivia alone in the sterile white room.  
  
The door slammed shut behind him.  
  
Olivia stared at the ceiling. The fresh bandage on her arm began to seep red. He hadn't even secured it properly.  
  
She closed her eyes. Abandoned. Again.  
  
She was discharged a few days later, her body still aching. Her phone rang. It was Ethan's social secretary.  
  
""Mrs. Prescott, just a reminder about Mr. Prescott's birthday celebration next Friday. The plans are proceeding as you instructed before your... indisposition.""  
  
Ethan's birthday. She had always planned his parties meticulously. Caterers, guest lists, decorations. He usually barely noticed, taking her efforts for granted.  
  
This year, it would be her last act of care. A farewell gift he wouldn't understand until it was too late.  
  
She gave the secretary a few final instructions, her voice calm.  
  
""And make sure the champagne is chilled to exactly forty-five degrees, a detail Mr. Prescott particularly appreciates.""  
  
A detail he'd once mentioned Chloe preferred.

The barista gave me that 'you sure?' look, and I nearly chickened out. But then I thought, 'Why the heck not?' I guess my fear wasn't just about the coffee. It felt more like a security blanket being taken away, like what if I hated it and wasted my money? What if people judged my taste?

Turns out, it wasn't bad at all. A nice change of pace, and it made me realize how silly some of my fears are. They're just so tiny when you look at them afterward. It's those small wins, making these tiny steps out of the comfort zone, that add up, ya know? 🍵",8,1751356121.0,edgeSteps,2,1.0,False

You just arrived next door, maybe for a new job, a fresh start, or the next chapter of something you’re still trying to figure out. (I enjoy characters who reflect real life.. so we can talk about who your character is and what brought her here.)

We haven’t really spoken. But our balconies are close, and sometimes, when the windows are open, I hear things. A little music. A voice on the phone. Laughter. Maybe even crying. Sometimes you hum to yourself. Sometimes I find myself listening without meaning to.

I’ve thought about slipping a note under your door. Leaving a coffee outside. Saying something.
Maybe this is me saying something.

What I'm looking for:

Yes, this will be NSFW but only when it makes sense. I’m drawn to characters who feel real, flawed, interesting and curious.

Plot Ideas (we can shape these together):

Maybe I write a note simple, awkward, honest. Maybe you reply. Maybe you don’t. That alone can build something.

Or maybe it starts with a glance over morning coffee. One of us waves. Maybe we don’t speak for weeks.

A wrong delivery, a late-night noise complaint, a conversation. 

If this is something you’re interested in, feel free to send me a message. Tell me a little about yourself, your writing style, and what kind of energy you’d bring to this. Plot ideas, twists, additions.... I’m all ears.

In other cities, I connected easily through cafés, hobbies, or international events, but here it’s been surprisingly difficult.

I’ve tried Bumble BFF, Meetup, IHL, WhatsApp and Facebook social groups (including women-only ones), but I often struggle to meet people in a similar life stage. I’m in my late 20s, not married, no kids, still renting, plan to stay in Leuven long term, don’t speak Dutch, not a student anymore, and that all seems to set me apart at events. Most people I meet are lovely, just in very different chapters of life, and it can be hard to relate.

Conversations usually stay surface-level because we both kind of know a deeper friendship might not evolve naturally. I keep attending events, but it’s mostly small talk, and tbh it’s getting tiring.

I work remotely for a company outside Leuven, so I don’t have local colleagues to befriend either. My partner has friends here, but they’re all Belgian and none are women, so that’s been a bit isolating too.

What I’m really looking for is a few good friends, especially girlfriends, to hang out with in a low-key way. People I can message on WhatsApp for a spontaneous coffee meet up, co-work now and then, vent about life, give and get advice, or just be a supportive presence for each other. Nothing complicated, just genuine connection. 

Would really appreciate any tips on how you’ve made long term friends here / built your circle 😊

Their mom is amazing! She’s so spontaneous, funny, and drop dead gorgeous. But I failed to see that before…because of my stupidity.

Khamrah is sweet and still my favorite since I’m not a fan of coffee notes, so I didn't get Qahwah. I got Dukhan because it's spicier, and layering both gives me the best of both worlds.

**Nexa Immortal & Muse – 8.5/10**  
Immortal is a clone of PDM Greenley, a really good green, citrusy, fruity, fresh scent. It was way cheaper than Aether, and I grabbed Muse for my wife too, which is a clone of Prada Paradoxe.

**Hawas Ice & Fire – 9.5/10**  
Both are summer bangers. Fire is more fruity and aromatic, I love it more, and I always get compliments when I wear it.

**CDNIM, Precieux 1 & Sillage – 8/10**  
Precieux is just amazing, very smooth. I like Sillage too, but CDNIM is a bit too harsh for me.

**1 Million Elixir & Privé – 10/10**  
I love 1 Million Privé, it's my #1 fragrance in winter. Elixir is a sweet, fruity, floral scent that pairs well.

**Turathi Blue & Brown – 9.5/10**  
Blue is aquatic and crowd-pleasing, Brown (Clone of YSL Tuxedo) is warm, deep, and confident perfect pair for casual and classy.

**Qaed Al Fursan Unlimited & Black – 8/10**  
The layering kings. Unlimited is a floral-fruity gourmand with a coconut forward vibe, while Black is just pineapple, pineapple, pineapple :)

Hi Everyone!

I'm not looking to just throw real money to avoid the grind, but asking if anyone has any gear / weapons they don't need and would be free to show my appreciation (even though it may not be a lot) to help me save time.

I'm new to botw and reddit so please go easy on me as I'm sure my post may be extremely noobish to ask.

I'm a 42 yr old single dad and absolutely love playing this game with my 6 year old son. Not only is this game remind me of the original Legend of Zelda on NES, but my son's having a blast while I'm secretly teaching him to improve his reading, his fractions (hearts and stamina wheel) and how to navigate :D

I do want my son to learn that farming for gear is apart of the growth in these games, but I'm spending a lot of time on youtube and online searching for guides/ tips/ walkthroughs just to get gear to make my way through. I'd really like to get back some sleep time at night instead of grinding the night away. I would gladly send a small token of appreciation instead of having to buy multiple coffees everyday to get through work :D

Also, I'm finding a lot of youtube videos about guides and walkthroughs are from 7 years ago and contain lots of glitches which may or may not be available anymore. Any and all positive advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

*(Quick note: If this type of post isn't allowed in this group, please accept my apologies! My genuine intent is simply to share a free resource to help social workers, especially recent MSW grads, on their licensure journey.)*

I'm one of the co-creators behind **License Journey** ([licensejourney.com](https://www.licensejourney.com/)). I came up with the idea for this tool, and then worked closely with an expert developer, providing continuous feedback that shaped it into what it is today. Our goal was to create a **completely free** online resource designed to help aspiring social workers, especially recent MSW grads, navigate their LCSW hours and prepare for licensure in California.

I started License Journey because I was tired of seeing other platforms charge so much. My goal is to give back to the social work community with a high-quality and accessible resource. 

Note: We are currently only available in CA for LCSW licenses; we will add more states and licenses like LMFT over time.

# Why Choose License Journey?

You might know about other tracking tools like TrackMyHours, but we offer some key differences:

* **Always Free (for now!):** Unlike services with fees, License Journey is 100% free. We want to make sure it’s absolutely perfect!  When we do introduce a paid option, our goal is for it to be affordable, like a cup of coffee. We believe you deserve that kind of care and accessibility, given all the care you provide to your clients.
* **Built for Social Workers, By Social Workers:** Our platform is designed with your specific needs in mind, offering intuitive tracking and helpful resources.
* **Proven Success:** We have over **600 users**, and some have finished logging their 3000 hours using License Journey!
* **More Than Just Tracking - Your Interview & Supervision Survival Guide:** Beyond hour tracking, we're building out a valuable **blog section** with practical advice. One key area we're focusing on is empowering new MSWs during job interviews.I personally experienced the frustration of being hired, only to discover a 6-month probation period before supervision began. Even after that, my supervisor refused to meet the California BBS requirements for adequate supervision (which required an additional hour of individual/triadic OR 2 hours of group supervision, to claim more than 10 clinical hours weekly), and wouldn't allow another social worker to be my second supervisor. This forced me to pay out-of-pocket for supervision outside of work hours. We want to help you avoid similar pitfalls! Our blog will offer concrete tips on crucial questions to ask during job interviews, specifically about supervision, probationary periods, and ensuring your future supervisor meets all BBS requirements from day one. We want you to be fully informed and advocate for the supervision you need and deserve.

# We're Growing – Share Your Ideas!

Right now, License Journey focuses on California LCSW requirements, but we plan to expand to other states. If you're an MSW outside of California and interested in using a free tool like ours, we'd love your feedback as we plan our expansion!

# Ready to Start Your Journey?

Visit[ licensejourney.com](https://www.licensejourney.com/)! We believe License Journey can be a valuable asset on your path to becoming a licensed clinical social worker.

We're always looking for ways to improve. Feel free to comment below or reach out directly with any questions, suggestions, or success stories! **If you start using License Journey, we'd love to collaborate with you to make it perfect – our contact information is always easy to find for any thoughts or suggestions.**

I'm a 30-year-old man and I've been dealing with a sleep issue for as long as I can remember: 

I wake up 2–4 times every night to pee.

It's been consistent throughout my life, and I’m not sure what’s causing it. I’d say I live a pretty healthy lifestyle:

- Go to bed at 9 pm and wake up at 5 am every day

- I don’t drink or smoke
- I do around 10 hours of sports per week
- Idrink about 2–3 liters of water daily
- I avoid processed/industrial food
- I keep coffee to 2–3 cups max per day (and even cut it out for a few months—no change)


I’ve also tried quite a few things to improve my sleep:

- I use nose strips at night to help with breathing
- I wear earplugs
- I’ve done two sleep apnea tests—results came back normal


Despite all this, I still wake up multiple times a night to pee. It’s frustrating and starting to impact how rested I feel.

I have tried to get her to get rid of some of the clothes (bearing in mind most of her clothes are thrifted anyway so it's not a financial loss), but this usually results in arguing and fighting.

I have also tried to get her to regularly schedule a maid, but she hates having someone in the house and begrudgingly brings a maid every 2 weeks (our climate is desert/dusty so this is nowhere near enough), our peers have a minimum of weekly (my parents have someone come 5 days a week but they can afford that, that's not the usual). We've had trial runs with several maids but many didn't come back, she think its bad luck but I suspect its because cleaning amid all the clutter is too laborious. Our maid brings another cleaning lady with her as one person cannot clean the apartment in a day given the clutter situation.

It's taking a toll on my marriage, I am constantly stressed out. Little things like having to be careful when putting my coffee mug on the table (have to check and make room for it), some doors not opening fully, and generally everywhere I look there is stuff. I'm constantly stressed from this and possibly as a result, am not in the mood for sex.

Therapists/mental health in our country isn't really a big thing, but I don't know what to do. 

I should add that my wife is amazing, very fun and outgoing and cheerful (but with a temper also), and I am crazy about her, but the clutter situation is making me resent her.

Any advice on how to deal with this, especially in a 3rd world/Middle East context?",2,1751354718.0,Marriage,1,0.67,False

**Help me choose an espresso machine before I lose my mind** 

Body:

Okay. So I’m finally done pretending instant coffee is fine. I want actual espresso at home. Something with a bit of ritual, good taste, and enough power to make me feel like I know what I’m doing (even if I don’t).

Narrowed it down to three options, all pretty different vibes. Would love thoughts if you’ve used any of these or just wanna help a sleep-deprived caffeine gremlin make a decent choice.

 **Must-haves (for me):**

* Good extraction pressure (20-bar is cool, right?)  
* Some kind of milk frother/steam wand (not just black coffee)  
* Ease of use  
* Either a grinder or a pod-friendly setup  
* Doesn’t take a whole kitchen to clean  

#  My Subjective Scorecard:

I’m leaning toward the 5700Gense for the grinder situation, but part of me wonders if I’ll regret all the extra steps when I’m half awake and just want a decent cup.

Would love to hear from people who’ve used any of these (or if there’s a 4th option I should be obsessed with instead).",1,1751354659.0,u_Pristine_Student6892,0,1.0,False

We lived together for 1 year, and shared 2 cats in which I now keep at my parents' house.

A little backstory on how I got to know him - I met him when I worked as a barista at a coffee shop when I was 18, and he was 25 and a manager. He always kind of struck me as a little bit odd, and I never was particularly interested in him until I started finding my living situation completely unbearable. For the short duration of time I was working there, he seemed persistent, but somehow subtly that he was interested in pursuing me.

He revealed various things about himself to me during the weeks that we got to know each other, when we worked the same shift. The most odd thing that he told me, and would be a recurring theme in our conversations, was about his LDR with a Mongolian girl. The ways in which he would describe her were kind of weird, ""passport-bro""-ish and overall just gave off a really weird vibe to me.

Some days when I would clock into work my mental health would really be in the dumps. It was difficult living at home during that time, and still is. My mother is the type of person to always try to instill negative thoughts and I would always feel like I am walking on eggshells around her. I would clock into work some days, and he would ask me what is wrong because he could see me visibly being upset, and me, having nobody else to vent to, would reveal a lot to him about my personal life. Almost every day that I was working, he was working as well. This happened numerous times and eventually he got to know a lot about me and my personal life at home.

Then, he began messaging me outside of work to check up on me. I thought, it was a little weird to do that since he did tell me that he has a girlfriend, and would talk a lot about her to me when we worked together. He didn't just check up on me occasionally, he would do this almost every night. I thought it was nice of him to do that, and didn't think much more of it.

I, naturally would ask him about his personal life in return, and he would always have a lot to say about his girlfriend in Mongolia. He told me that he works an upwards of 80 hours a week between 2 jobs to afford to purchase her various gifts, that he spends a lot of money on her, repeatedly purchases her gifts of $500 valuation and sends them to Mongolia for her, and that he pays for her rent while she lives in Italy. He told me that he has flown over to Mongolia twice, and is flying to Italy that October to visit her as well. He told me that he does all of these things out of obligation because he felt like she helped him a lot during low points of his life. I thought that all of these things that he was telling me was very odd but I ignored it and continued talking to him as friends almost every day. Every single time that I saw him at work he seemed visually distressed as well, and he told me that it was because of his obligation to work 80 hours a week to support this person's lifestyle.

When October came around and it was time for him to go to Italy, he kept telling me that he doesn't really want to go and is just going there out of obligation and feels bad. I thought to myself, that it was kind of odd that he was doing these things and flying to Italy if he truly does not want to be with this person, but at the same time is talking to me every day, and tried to give me a hug when I wished him a good trip. I obliged and hugged him, when he asked if he could hug me, not because I was particularly interested in him but just because I felt bad for him and the predicament he was in.

When he was in Italy, he would text me a lot. Paragraphs of messages, telling me about how his efforts in his current relationship are unrequited, and that it really pains him and he wants to start a new chapter in his life. I told him that I am sure that he would be able to find somebody out there that will appreciate his efforts. This conversation occurred a few times throughout his trip and eventually he made the decision to break up with her. He did mention that he would pay her rent until December of that year. I did not necessarily feel any way about his relationship and was still talking to him as a friend at this point.

When he returned home from his trip, I was scheduled to work with him the next morning. When I arrived to open the store that morning, he surprised me with a bunch of gifts of various types - souvenirs, pastries, and chocolates from Italy, and told me that he wanted to express how much he appreciates having me in his life. I was flattered by this, admittingly, but I still felt a little bit odd about this person in general and was suspicious about his intentions.

That day when I returned home, I got into a really big disagreement with my mother, over the use of my car that I purchased with my own money to go to school - she wanted to use it at the same time that I needed to use it to go to class, and she really lost it and started screaming at me and calling me various names that I wouldn't want to repeat (f-ing b word) and told me that I need to move out and she does not want to be around me. This is not the first time that she has acted this way, she actually acts like this very frequently but this was the biggest outburst she's had in a really long time.

Naturally, the next day I confided with this person about the situation with my mom, that I was sick of this being a normal part of my life, and I was crying. He comforted me as much as he could and uplifted me to an extent and made me feel some hope for the future. When I got home that day, I received some messages from him, suggesting that we become roommates so I can get out of this situation with my mother. Being in the headspace that I was, I thought that was a great idea and told him so, and we agreed to start looking at places to rent the following weeks, and we eventually picked out a place that was reasonable. I'll start referring to this person as N to make this a little easier.

When we moved in together, we each brought air mattresses and stayed in separate rooms for a few nights. One night, I was hungry in the early morning hours and when I went to the kitchen, N woke up and asked me if everything was okay. I said that I was fine, and he went to use the bathroom. When he got out of the bathroom and I was still looking through the fridge, he tapped me on the back, and leaned in to kiss me. One thing led to another, and he asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes. I don't know why I did - I still think it might be because of all of the unresolved feelings I had towards my family, and I just felt like I needed someone to confide in and be vulnerable with. I was not particularly attracted to N but I appreciated the kindness and effort he's shown me the past few months.

Flash forward a few weeks and he asks me if I could do him a favor drive his little sister, who lives nearby, to a sleepover as he is unable to, being at work. I agreed because I had not met her yet, and wanted to make a good first impression. When I picked her up, we made some conversation and I asked her about school and such, and eventually we landed on the topic of N and our relationship. She looked at me, and said with a straight face, that the dynamic of the last relationship he was in with the girl in Mongolia was very weird, and that she was only 16 when they began their relationship. I was shocked, and this shattered me - I asked her a few follow-up questions like ""Wow, are you serious"" and tried to keep my composure until I dropped her off.

I already signed a 1-year lease with this person. When he got home from work, I mentioned this to him, and he just started crying, and told me that it was a period of his life that he really regrets, and that he did not mention this to me because he was afraid of how I would react, and that I wouldn't be interested in him anymore if he revealed this to me. He told me that when he found out that this person was 16, he immediately ceased all contact with her until she turned 18, like that makes it any better...

I asked coworkers if they had any knowledge about this person he was in a ""relationship"" with, and I was told by a coworker that they vaguely remember him talking about purchasing her a dress for her high school graduation. I was disgusted by this beyond belief and mentioned this to him, which he outright denied. He kept profusely apologizing and assuring me that he did not go out of his way to be with this person, and that she reached out to him on Instagram when he had a page for the music he writes, and she lied about her age. I still found, and feel this way today too, that it is still extremely odd that he needlessly spent an upwards of $20,000 on this person who he found out was a minor at some point. I never really forgave him for omitting this information from me, and I still feel weird about it, although I have accepted it a little bit more.

I also found out that, all of this money he had been spending on this girl in Mongolia, accumulated to a lot of debt, along with other debts that he had accumulated from school and credit cards. This amount totals to \~30k and he mentioned, and still mentions it very frequently to me.

Over the year of us living together, the effort that he has put into our relationship has gradually diminished by a lot. We stopped having sex, almost completely, until he pressured me to try anal with him, and I did, just because I wanted to feel some sort of closeness with him again. He stopped being romantic, or passionate with me at all, and whenever things would seemingly steer in that direction he would find some way to make a joke out of it, or brush it off as a way to stop any of those moments from happening. This was exacerbated by a bunch of stressors that he has had on his life, including his debt and negative self-image.

Out of curiosity, one day I picked up his Apple Watch and looked through his messages with other people. I saw that he had sustained long conversations, of many paragraphs, with his female coworkers, and I was curious of what those conversations were about. I saw there was one conversation where he expressed that he will never put as much effort for another woman after his previous relationship - and he actually said this in another conversation with one of his friends. A different conversation, which I found the most hurtful, was one where he expressed that he does not feel very excited about me at all, does not see a future with me, and is thinking about breaking up with me.

I confronted him about these messages, and he denied feeling that sort of way at all.

I just don't know how I will have it in me to break up with him, especially with the financial predicament he is in. Also, I have introduced this person to my entire family, including extended family, and have shown up with him together to a lot of family events of mine and his. I just don't know how that transition will be, not being with him anymore - I am more afraid of what the breakup would ensue, rather than the thought of not being with him. I just feel like I am just existing, with no passion at all, and turning 22 by the end of the year, I really just want to experience more things at this point of my life before I lock in for graduate school and I cannot imagine this person wanting to do much of anything with me. I met somebody, a mutual friend, who I actually do not get any weird vibes from, and is attractive and seems interested in me, and although I don't feel like I am in the place to pursue anything new right away, I just kept imagining the idea of being with somebody who I can actually be vulnerable and passionate with, and I longed for that idea.

I wish that I felt safe and comfortable at home so I didn't feel the need to immediately move out with this person. I wish this person did not owe me over $2000. The past 2 years of my life, although there were some good memories, have just felt so unfulfilling and full of regret. Honestly, I still do not know what to make of this situation and it seems just as crazy and unreal to me as it does to whoever I tell it to. I almost do not believe that this is my life.

TLDR; I am thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend of a little over 2 years but he is in a terrible financial predicament, owes me over $2000, and generally is in a really low point of his life. I found out at the beginning of our relationship from his sister, after signing a lease with him to escape an abusive family at home, that he was in a relationship with a 16 year old girl in Mongolia, and spent an upwards of $20,000 on this girl over the course of over a year. When I asked him about this he was crying and told me that she lied about her age, and when he found out her actual age, he stopped contact with her briefly and then resumed when she turned 18, although that doesn't make it any better at all. I wanted to get out of that situation but I did not have any money to break the lease and flash forward another year and here I am. I am still emotionally attached to this person but am unsure how to navigate these feelings when I consider his past and the fact that he does not want to be vulnerable or intimate with me at all, stating that the reasoning is because of me confronting him about all of these issues (that he owes me money too) and external stressors.",4,1751354318.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

So there I was, scrolling through profiles on yet another quiet evening, fully expecting to land on another ""hi and bye"" situation... Then I stumbled upon this guy's profile. His bio was kinda quirky and popped with a sense of humor that I immediately vibed with. Plus, he mentioned a mutual love for cheesy '80s movies, so obviously, I had to swipe right.

Fast forward a few messages, a meme exchange, and a phone call later (yes, those still exist, apparently!), we decided to meet up. He suggested this cozy little coffee shop I'd never been to before, and tbh, getting out of the usual bar scene was a refreshing change. 🌟 

Not gonna lie, I was expecting the usual interview-style chat, but we started talking, and suddenly, two hours had flown by. We bonded over our shared disdain for pineapple on pizza and ended up geeking out over our favorite TV shows. I left that date actually looking forward to another one, which hasn't happened in... well, ages!

1louwmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1louwmp/i_sleep_55_65_hours_12_powernaps_is_that_ok/,I sleep 5.5 - 6.5 hours + 1\2 powernaps - is that ok?,"Hey there, Andrea from Italy, 38 years old, weight’s in a normal range (191 cm, 91–92 kg).

I've never been a big sleeper, but up until I finished my studies (around 26 years old), I used to sleep about 7 to 7.5 hours a night. After that, my sleep schedule naturally dropped to around 5.5–6 hours during summer and 6–6.5 during winter. If I ever dare to go past that limit, I end up oversleeping and feeling off all day - dizzy, confused, slow. Sometimes a short power nap in the morning can reset me, or a good 1–2 hour walk helps, but not always.

Besides my usual night sleep (I have no issues falling asleep or going to bed), I can squeeze in 1 or 2 power naps a day that really recharge me.

Is this... okay for my health? Or should I talk to someone, since this might be too little sleep?

For context:

* When I wake up, I feel well-rested. I'm a morning person, and up until 2–3 PM I can juggernaut through any intellectual task at double efficiency. Power naps give me that same boost again for about an hour in the afternoon or evening.
* I work as a software engineer, so lots of sitting and screen time. I take my 10–15 minute breaks for coffee or a walk, but yeah - it’s a pretty sedentary work life.
* I do about 1 hour of walking daily, or on alternate days I’ll do 2–3 hours of intense walking.
* Since I was around 7 or 8, I've had sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations. I'm super used to them by now and can usually see them coming - either from too much or too little sleep, or from going past 15 minutes on a power nap.
* I had practiced sport (Baseball) since when i was 10 up until 28-29, but it wasn't that intense to justify these drastic reduction in sleep time.",1,1751352647.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

Now my friend suggested I drink and coffee so I can go to the toilet but I’m a completely coffe caffeine hater. I never drink caffeine ever. Now I finally let in and drank a coffee with soy milk it was not that bad it didn’t do anything so without thinking about it I also drank an americano ( I now stupid ). We then walked home looked in a few shops and then I had a slow BM at home. I showered and wanted to get ready. All of the sudden I felt so bad. I thought I had circulation problems and needed to sit down. I was dizzy, nauseos and after that I did go again on the toilettet. I tried to calm down and still wanted to go out I also did ate an banana and some cracker and had diarrhea again😭 it’s the next day my stomach feels funny I’m scared to eat and don’t know what to do. I’m on mesalamine and there are only 2 days left. Maybe it was also the sun and u had in addition sun poisoning idk. And I know it’s my fault but I feel so bad now like it’s mentally draining.

So here’s the thing: if you’re over 40, juggling a dozen things a day, and your energy feels like it’s been siphoned off by some invisible vampire... you’re not imagining it.

You’re busy. Your hormones have decided to throw surprise parties. And if your metabolism were any slower, it’d be backing up traffic. I feel you.

The 7 Minute Ageless Body Secret is a bite-sized solution promising to **boost metabolism**, tone soft spots, and ditch guilt, all in under 10 minutes a day.

But does it really deliver? I temporarily stopped Googling ""**how to tone your body after age 50**"" and I gave it a proper whirl — I even convinced my friend Lisa to try it too — to see if this **quick full-body toning routine for busy women** is worth your precious time.

# 📦 Product Overview

**Product Name**: 7 Minute Ageless Body Secret  
**Category**: Fitness & Wellness ➝ Women's Workouts  
**Overall Verdict**: 4.4/5

# 🔍 What Is the 7 Minute Ageless Body Secret?

It’s a smartly ordered sequence of low-impact movements made for women 40 and up. The goal? Trigger fat burn, improve strength, and restore energy.

This isn’t HIIT hell or trendy gym fluff. It’s **a short daily routine that supports hormonal balance** and eases you into a rhythm without overloading your joints.

You’ll find yourself doing **fat-burning exercises that are easy on the joints**, targeting hips, thighs, arms, and belly with no equipment and no burpees (bless).

The program revolves around **a highly effective 7‑minute fat-loss workout**, which kickstarts metabolism and tones the body without the sweat-drenched drama.

# 🔥 How It Works: The Metabolism-Boosting Secret Sauce

The secret is a deliberate series of moves that stimulate muscle groups and prolong fat burn — think of it as **a low-impact exercise that activates the afterburn effect**.

This is how **short workouts can keep your body burning fat all day**, even while folding laundry or fussing with emails you forgot to reply to (again).

It’s also **a metabolism-boosting workout plan for women in their 50s** — especially those looking to recharge without pounding pavement or joining bootcamps.

Consistency triggers better results. The afterburn helps your body use energy efficiently while addressing hormonal shifts that love storing belly fat.

# 👩‍🎨 Lisa's Experience Using the 7 Minute Ageless Body Secret

This one actually came from my friend **Lisa**, who I met at a local community composting co-op last summer.

She’s a high school art teacher in her mid-40s and spends half her day either hunched over student projects or standing for hours doing class demos — not exactly gentle on the body.

She’s also the type who doesn’t have the time (or frankly, the patience) for long workouts and endless health trends.

Lisa started using the 7 Minute Ageless Body Secret because she wanted something realistic she could do between grading papers and prepping for classes — something to **tone your body quickly without doing heavy cardio**. She texted me about it one weekend:

>

She loved how the routine felt manageable without being boring. After a couple weeks, she said her back didn’t ache as much after long school days, and she noticed her waist felt firmer.

Her biggest win? Feeling like she could stick with it without guilt-tripping herself.

Her only tiny gripe? She wished the video setting had a little more personality. (Her words: “I’m visual — give me a plant or something!”)

But overall, she felt it was **a daily fitness routine that** worked well **for her busy schedules** — and she’s still doing it three mornings a week before making her first coffee.

She’s a high school art teacher in her mid-40s and spends half her day either hunched over student projects or standing for hours doing class demos — not exactly gentle on the body.

She’s also the type who doesn’t have the time (or frankly, the patience) for long workouts and endless health trends.

Lisa started using the 7 Minute Ageless Body Secret because she wanted something realistic she could do between grading papers and prepping for classes — something to **tone your body quickly without doing heavy cardio**. She texted me about it one weekend:

>

She loved how the routine felt manageable without being boring. After a couple weeks, she said her back didn’t ache as much after long school days, and she noticed her waist felt firmer.

Her biggest win? Feeling like she could stick with it without guilt-tripping herself.

Her only tiny gripe? She wished the video setting had a little more personality. (Her words: “I’m visual — give me a plant or something!”)

But overall, she felt it was **a daily fitness routine that** worked well **for her busy schedules** — and she’s still doing it three mornings a week before making her first coffee.

# 🔥 How It Works: The Metabolism-Boosting Secret Sauce

7 Minute Ageless Body Secret is a digital program designed to help women naturally get lean, energized, sexy, and younger bodies at any age.

As we grow older, our bodies become weaker because of the continuous use of the body's organs over the years. Many people are uncomfortable with “growing old” because of the changes in our appearance that comes with it. Women fear more of getting older since their bodies are naturally more vulnerable than men.

Most women wish they could find a solution to this problem. That's why 75% of women base their skincare products on their desire to look younger. To look like youthful women aging-gracefully, they spend a ton of money on products that only graze the surface of anti-aging, spend hours running on a treadmill, and eat horrible food choices that make them feel miserable.

In this regard, 7 Minute Ageless Body Secret is a simple step-by-step guide to help you achieve the firm, fit and youthful body you want without all the gimmicks. You will receive a particular manual and natural stimulation methods to help you achieve a younger and more muscular body.

In this review, you will know how the program works. Is it useful, and what does it contain. Let's dive into 7 Minute Ageless Body Secret reviews in detail!

# What is the 7 Minute Ageless Body Secret Program?

7 Minute Ageless Body Secret is an online, anti-aging workout regime designed to help women tone their bodies better and bring out their most energized, sexy, and youthful self – at any age. This program uses natural stimulation methods, written instructions, video exercises, and much more to help you shape your body, boost your metabolism, flush out the excess weight and embrace your youthful self.

“Dawn Sylvester”, a body transformation coach and women's anti-aging expert, developed the program. Dawn has been coaching women on ways to reshape their bodies to look and feel younger.

However, in her 30s, Sylvester sought to find a solution to her poor body and put in lots of effort to research ways to improve her body. After years of trying, she discovered a secret technique that finally worked and helped her achieve her dream body. With that secret, she looked like a 40-year-old in her 60. 

Dawn shares her secret of a younger and healthier body to help other women remove all the obstacles that have kept them stuck that their body is too old to change. The program has worked for many and can work for you too.

# How does 7 Minute Ageless Body Secret work?

The program includes a series of strategic strength training workouts and great techniques that allow you to train every muscle from head to toe to restore a youthful look in just 7 minutes.

Studies indicate that your extra rolls, the weight that won't come off, and your fatigue are symptoms of your ‘broken metabolism'—which is usually slower as you grow older. Yes! Your metabolism has been turned off, so you look and feel older.

The movement patterns inside the 7 Minutes workout are specifically designed to reset your metabolism the way it worked when you were younger. The program reboots your dead metabolism, triggers anti-aging feel-good hormones throughout your body, and you start feeling and looking better.

Better metabolism helps your body overcome the sluggishness of age; it helps the body renew itself and block any signs of aging. This complete weight loss program includes science-proven techniques all focus on burning unwanted fat from your body, targeting trouble spots like the belly, arms, waistline, butt, and thigh, and improving your physique by wiping out fat from this area.

[Try the free tool now.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

#### Introduction to the Digital Nomad Visa in Canada

The world’s gone mobile. Laptops in backpacks. Zoom calls from beaches. But now—Canada’s rolling out the welcome mat. Not for everyone. For the bold. For the restless. For the digital nomad who wants more than palm trees and Wi-Fi.

Canada. The land of maple syrup and moose. Suddenly, it’s the next big thing for global wanderers. Why? Because the doors are creaking open, just wide enough for the brave.

**🔥 _Curious if you can fund your Canadian adventure? Diagnose Your Digital Nomad Income Potential in Under 90 seconds! [Check now.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

#### What is a Digital Nomad Visa?

Every country wants a piece of the remote work pie. Digital nomad visas are popping up like mushrooms after rain. Most offer a year of freedom—work from anywhere, pay your way, don’t be a burden.

But Canada? It’s not just following the herd. It’s rewriting the script. Think: access to world-class cities, wild nature, and a passport to North America’s tech scene.

#### The Canadian Digital Nomad Visa: Fast Facts

Who’s it for? The self-starters. The freelancers. The remote employees with a taste for adventure. What’s on offer? Legal permission to live, work, and play—without the fear of border agents breathing down your neck.

You want options? Canada’s got them. Flexible stays. The chance to upgrade your status. A foot in the door to something bigger.

**🌎 _Ready to measure your digital nomad earning power? Diagnose Your Digital Nomad Income Potential in Under 90 seconds! [Take the test.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

#### The Allure of Canada for Digital Nomads

Forget the clichés. Canada is more than snow and apologies. It’s a land of contrasts—urban jungles bristling with innovation, wild frontiers that’ll make your heart race.

Tech scenes that rival Silicon Valley. Art, music, coffee shops that never sleep. If you crave stimulation, you’ll never be bored.

#### Eligibility Criteria: Are You In?

Not everyone gets a golden ticket. You’ll need proof of remote work. A job with a foreign employer, or your own thriving business. Money in the bank—enough to survive, maybe even thrive.

It’s not just about what you do. It’s about who you are. Canada wants the driven, the resourceful, the ones who don’t just take—they contribute.

**💡 _Wondering if you’re cut out for the nomad life? Diagnose Your Digital Nomad Income Potential in Under 90 seconds! [Discover now.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

#### Application Process: The Gauntlet

Bureaucracy. Nobody loves it, but you can’t avoid it. Here’s the drill: fill out the forms. Upload your documents. Prove you’re legit—a contract, a bank statement, a passport that isn’t about to expire.

Double-check everything. One typo, and you’re back to square one. Don’t give them a reason to say no.

#### The Waiting Game: Processing Times

You hit submit. Now you wait. Could be weeks. Could be months. Sometimes, it’s a sprint. Sometimes, a marathon. Delays? They happen. Missing paperwork. Background checks. Random bad luck.

Patience isn’t just a virtue—it’s a survival skill.

**✈️ _Think you’re ready? Diagnose Your Digital Nomad Income Potential in Under 90 seconds! [See for yourself.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

#### Rights and Limitations

You’re in, but you’re not invincible. You can work—remotely. You can live—almost anywhere. But you can’t take local jobs. You can’t start a side hustle on Canadian soil.

Stay in your lane. Respect the rules. Or risk getting the boot.

#### Taxes and Money: The Unspoken Truth

Here’s the kicker. Taxes. Where do you pay? How much? It’s a gray area—one you’ll want to navigate with a pro. Banking? Set up a local account, or pay through the nose in fees.

Don’t let the system eat your earnings. Plan ahead. Outsmart the taxman.

#### Healthcare and Insurance: Don’t Get Caught Off Guard

Canada’s healthcare is legendary—for citizens. For you? Not so fast. You’ll need private insurance. The good kind. The kind that covers more than a stubbed toe.

Don’t gamble with your health. One accident, and you could be wiped out.

#### Where to Land: Canadian Cities for Nomads

Toronto. The city that never sits still. Vancouver. Where mountains meet the sea. Montreal. Culture shock in the best way. But don’t ignore the underdogs—Halifax, Calgary, Victoria. Each with its own flavor, its own tribe.

Pick your playground. The right city changes everything.

**🚀 _Still unsure? Diagnose Your Digital Nomad Income Potential in Under 90 seconds! [Take the leap.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

#### Community and Networking

You’re not alone. Coworking spaces buzz with energy. Meetups, masterminds, Slack channels—your new best friend could be one coffee away.

Plug in. Share your story. Build your network. The right connection can change your trajectory overnight.

#### Internet and Infrastructure: Will It Work?

Canada’s wired. Fast internet in the cities. Reliable connections even in the wilds—mostly. But check before you go off-grid. Digital amenities are the lifeblood of your hustle.

No Wi-Fi, no income. Simple as that.

#### Weather and Seasons: Not for the Faint of Heart

Winter. It’s real. It’s relentless. But it’s also magical—if you’re prepared. Summers? Short, sweet, and worth the wait.

Dress in layers. Invest in boots. Learn to love the cold—or chase the sun across provinces.

#### Culture Shock and Integration

Canadians are friendly—almost suspiciously so. But every culture has its quirks. Learn the lingo. Say “sorry” often. Don’t cut in line.

Blend in, but stay you. Authenticity breaks barriers.

#### Family and Dependents: Can They Come?

Bringing the crew? You’ll need extra paperwork. Proof of funds. Schooling for kids, childcare for the little ones. It’s doable—but not automatic.

Plan ahead. The system rewards the prepared.

#### Renewal and Next Steps

Love it here? You might not have to leave. Renewal options exist. Maybe even a path to permanent residency. But you’ll need to prove your worth—all over again.

Stay sharp. Stay compliant. Opportunity favors the persistent.

#### Pitfalls and Common Mistakes

Don’t get cocky. Miss a deadline, forget a document, and you’re toast. Overstay, and you risk blacklisting. Underestimate the cost of living, and you’ll burn through savings fast.

Learn from others. Dodge the landmines.

#### Success Stories: Real Nomads, Real Wins

People have done it. Built businesses. Made friends for life. Found love, even. The secret? Grit, adaptability, and a touch of luck.

Their stories aren’t fairy tales—they’re blueprints.

#### Is the Canadian Digital Nomad Visa Worth It?

Here’s the bottom line. It’s not for everyone. But for the ambitious? The restless? The ones who want more than a postcard life? It’s a game-changer.

1lourd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeriodontalDisease/comments/1lourd6/is_this_gum_recession/,Is this gum recession?,"35 F, never smoking or vaping, no alcohol use. (I drink coffee nearly every day but make a point to floss or use waterpik after). No known medical conditions.

Can someone please help me understand what’s going on with the gumline on my top central incisors? I’ve been stressing/obsessing and would really like to resolve it if possible!

https://imgur.com/a/v3poUiR (First 4 photos are from March/April/May when the redness was more pronounced, and the others are from a couple days ago)

Dental history: I had braces and TADs removed two years ago and then gum contouring/gingivectomy to even out the gumline (performed by my ortho).  I have a bonded permanent retainer behind my top teeth (canine to canine) and wear plastic fitted retainers overnight. Even with my retainer, my dentist and hygienists always note that my gums are very healthy.

Backstory: A reddish bump/swollen area appeared over my right central incisor at the end of March. No bleeding or pain, but the gums felt “tight” in that area. I remember biting into an apple and it hurting, but I don’t know if the apple bite caused this spot or if it was already there (?).

Weirdly, along with the redness, there are also “lines” that have developed, almost in a v-shape, extending from the interdental papilla along the gingival margins of my top central incisors (basically the area where the gingivectomy was performed). The lines are very faint and only visible at certain angles, so I’m not 100% sure they weren’t there before and maybe I’m only just now noticing them.

But, is it possible that this swollen “spot” and the “lines” are the gums growing back, even nearly two years later? Or is this just gum recession?

I have diligent dental hygiene (brushing with fluoride toothpaste morning & night, water pik after meals, and flossing with string floss morning & night) but realize it’s possible that I’ve “over-brushed” or wasn’t careful to brush gently, and maybe the red spot is from trauma and it just isn’t healing well?

Since this issue appeared, I’ve been more careful with gently flossing and gently brushing (sonicare) and switched my toothbrush head to extra soft.

I went for a localized deep clean on May 1 for the area. The hygienist noted great hygiene overall and no issues with pocket depth. The dentist and hygienist seemed to agree that it might be from trauma or brushing too hard.

Fast forward to now, and the swelling has markedly decreased but isn’t totally gone, and it looks like there’s still a red spot (maybe petechiae?) along the gumline of my right central incisor. Is this recession? Leftover damage from trauma? Redness caused by mouth breathing? Could it be the gingivectomy “growing back”?

Please help :/ thanks so much for any insight!",1,1751352077.0,PeriodontalDisease,0,1.0,False

A car tears through winding roads. Music thumping, windows down. The sun’s dipping low—orange through the trees.

INT. CAR – CONTINUOUS

CHARLI (Zendaya) is driving, one hand on the wheel, sunglasses on. She looks dead inside but still hot.

SHYLIA (Gabriette) leans from the passenger seat, scrolling TikTok with one AirPod in. Her vibe is “don’t talk to me unless you’re hot or helpful.”

AUGUST (Jacob Elordi) lounges in the backseat, eating Hot Cheetos. Feet on the dash.

LYNNIE (Sabrina Carpenter) sits beside him, clutching a tiny Bible in her lap. Whispering a prayer.

CHARLI

If one more person asks how much the Airbnb cost, I’m turning this bitch around.

SHYLIA

You’re not. You love holding it over our heads.

AUGUST

We’re literally in the woods. If we die, it’s ‘cause this place screams Craigslist murder cabin.

LYNNIE

It was on Airbnb. I checked.

CHARLI

Okay but did you check check? Like “do these hosts eat people” type check?

They all laugh. The car pulls onto a gravel path.

Up ahead—an insane modern house appears out of nowhere. Glass, wood, huge windows. Rich energy. Isolated as hell.

 
EXT. AIRBNB – MOMENTS LATER

They pile out. Slam the trunk. Everyone’s got way too many bags.

STARRIE (Alex Consani) stumbles out of a second car, already holding a flask like it’s a purse.

STARRIE

What’s up, sluts? We live here now.

SIMON (Timothée Chalamet) follows behind, adjusting his hoodie.

SIMON

Feels like we’re about to die. Just saying.

LUCAS (Bad Bunny) climbs out last, dropping a duffel.

LUCAS

If I get murdered, I’m haunting Simon specifically.

BAILEY (Sydney Sweeney) walks up from the back seat, holding two grocery bags… and a sketchy wooden box.

BAILEY

Guess who brought games.

CHARLI

If that’s Monopoly, I’m setting you on fire.

BAILEY

Worse.

She opens the box. Inside: an old-ass Ouija board. Wood. Faded letters.

Everyone groans. But the mood shifts. Just a little.

 
INT. AIRBNB – NIGHT

Low lights. Music playing. Everyone’s already half-crossed: drunk, high, maybe both.

Starrie’s dancing in the hallway like she’s alone in a club.

Charli’s curled up on the couch, scrolling.

KELLY (SZA) walks into the kitchen, real quiet. She’s the type who sees everything and says nothing—until now.

KELLY

This place feels wrong.

SHYLIA

That’s literally just the edible.

LYNNIE

It’s the board. That thing’s cursed.

SIMON

We are not summoning shit tonight. No offense, I like breathing.

LUCAS

I don’t. Let’s do it.

Bailey slaps the Ouija board onto the coffee table. Everyone circles it. Half-joking. Half-terrified.

 
INT. LIVING ROOM – LATER

Everyone’s got their fingers on the planchette. Candles. Dead quiet.

BAILEY

Spirits, if you’re here, talk to us.

The planchette jerks. Starts moving fast.

Spelling out:

R – U – N

Everyone just stops.

AUGUST

Nah. Who did that?

CHARLI

Not me.

STARRIE

My hands were on my thighs. I was literally texting my ex.

The lights flicker.

SIMON

Nope. Nope nope nope.

BAILEY

It’s the fuse box. Chill.

Then everything cuts. Pitch black.

Screams. Someone drops a bottle.

SIMON

I’ll check it. Stay here.

He grabs his phone flashlight and disappears into the dark hallway.

 
EXT. DRIVEWAY – SAME TIME

Charli’s loading her bags into the car like she’s been ready to leave since minute one.

Shylia’s right behind her, zipping up her hoodie.

CHARLI

I’m not dying ‘cause someone wanted to play Scooby-Doo in the woods.

SHYLIA

Amen.

August tosses his backpack in.

AUGUST

Let’s bounce.

Lynnie hesitates, then climbs in.

LYNNIE

But… the sheriff—

CHARLI

They’ll call him. Or summon him with that board. We’re out.

They peel out of the driveway.

A moment later—

BOOM.

A huge, distant explosion. Red light flashes across the trees.

 
INT. LIVING ROOM – CONTINUOUS

Everyone still in the house freezes.

KELLY

What the hell was that?

STARRIE

Please tell me someone lit fireworks and not, like, the wrath of God.

BAILEY

Wait—where’s Beck?

BECK (O.S.)

Right here.

He steps into the room, calm as hell. Holding a candle.

BECK

We’ve got more guests coming.

No one says anything.

LUCAS

More guests… like, people?

BECK

Like friends.

He walks out, back into the dark like that was a normal answer.

STARRIE

Did he say that like a threat or am I high?

SIMON

Yes.

 
EXT. DIRT ROAD – NIGHT

An old SUV pulls up. Headlights bounce over the trees.

Out step:

● SUE (Olivia Rodrigo): black mini skirt, fishnets, and a glittery pink hoodie. Already filming for TikTok.
● JULIEY (Maddie Ziegler): platform boots, smacking gum, holding a glass of wine.
● SYLVIA (Jenna Ortega): quiet, hoodie pulled up, looks like she hates this already.
● DEQUAN (Caleb McLaughlin): blunt behind his ear, phone in hand.
● SAMIRA (Storm Reid): leather jacket, boots, straight face.
● MARVIN (Jack Champion): shirtless, for no reason. Lifting a case of beer.
● JUMIAN (Finn Wolfhard): hoodie zipped to his chin, backpack full of god-knows-what.
They look like trouble.

SUE

This place is so sketchy. I’m obsessed.

SAMIRA

Why does it smell like weed and trauma?

They head up toward the house.

 
INT. KITCHEN – LATER

Everyone’s smashed together now. The Airbnb feels smaller. Hotter. Tense.

Charli’s gone. Shylia, August, Lynnie — all gone.

New energy. New chaos.

JULIEY

(to Simon)

Are you one of those “sad boy” types or are you just naturally pale?

SIMON

Both.

KELLY

(to Dequan)

You ever get a feeling something already went really wrong?

DEQUAN

Constantly.

BAILEY

Okayyy shut up, let’s have fun.

She starts pouring shots.

LUCAS

Where’s the power?

BECK

Don’t worry about it.

 
INT. BATHROOM – LATER

Sylvia’s washing her face.

She pauses. Sees something move behind her in the mirror.

She turns. Nothing.

SYLVIA

Okay. Nope.

She opens the door—

BECK is standing there.

SYLVIA

Jesus—can you not?

BECK

It’s almost time.

SYLVIA

For what?

He just smiles.

 
INT. BEDROOM – LATER

Sue and Juliey are taking selfies. Marvin’s passed out on the floor.

Sylvia enters, pale. No one really notices.

JULIEY

You good?

SYLVIA

No.

 
INT. LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Everyone’s winding down. Weird energy.

Lights flicker again.

JUMIAN

No one’s gonna talk about the power being off for hours?

SUE

Honestly I thought it was the vibes.

KELLY

This house feels wrong. Worse than earlier.

BAILEY

Alright. Let’s get into something real.

She gestures. Beck brings in a weird black box.

They open it.

Inside: ceremonial knives. Candles. Rope.

SAMIRA

You brought a whole murder kit to a vacation?

BECK

Call it… tradition.

He strikes a match. Lights a circle of candles on the floor.

BAILEY

Everyone, sit.

DEQUAN

No.

BAILEY

You sure?

Two hooded figures appear behind them.

STARRIE

Wait—what the f—

Someone grabs her. Screams. Chaos. Everything explodes.

 
INT. BASEMENT – NIGHT

Lights strobe. A ritual circle has been drawn in blood.

Sylvia is dead.

Cooked.

Laid out like a meal.

The group—Sue, Juliey, Marvin, Dequan, Kelly, Samira, Jumian—tied up or frozen, mouths gagged. Eyes wide.

Samira’s backed into a corner. Dequan watches her—he’s holding it together only for her.

BECK

Eat. Or you’re next.

JULIEY

(whispers)

You’re insane.

BAILEY

Nah. I’m awake.

She steps forward with a plate of cooked flesh.

BAILEY (CONT’D)

You think this ends with one body?

She shoves it toward Marvin. He spits it out, gagging.

Beck hits him across the face. Hard.

BECK

Swallow.

Everyone freezes.

SAMIRA

(through gag)

Fuck you.

Bailey smiles.

BAILEY

Take her.

 
INT. STORAGE ROOM – MOMENTS LATER

Samira’s tied up. Screaming. They don’t care.

The cultists hold her down.

DEQUAN (O.S.)

HEY!

He crashes in—tackles one of them.

Kelly follows. Breaks a bottle over the other’s head.

KELLY

Untie her!

Too late.

A blade slices into Samira’s side.

She gasps. Again. Again.

They don’t go for the throat. They let her feel it.

She screams. Kicks.

Then she stops.

Dead.

KELLY (CONT’D)

No—NO—

DEQUAN

Grab her. We’re getting out.

They pick up her body and run.

 
INT. HALLWAY – NIGHT

Dequan and Kelly drag Samira’s corpse down the smoky hall. Flames burn in the background. The cult’s scattered.

DEQUAN

They’re burning. We finish it now.

KELLY

What about Bailey and Beck?

DEQUAN

They die too.

 
INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL – LATER

Bailey and Beck. Calm. Sitting.

Beck’s bleeding from a shoulder wound.

BECK

It was always gonna go like this.

BAILEY

You think they’ll make it out?

BECK

Not alive.

The trapdoor bursts open.

Dequan. Kelly.

No words.

They fire.

Bailey—shot in the chest.

Beck—head blown open.

Done.

 
EXT. WOODED ROAD – SUNRISE

A car. Quiet.

Samira’s wrapped in a tarp. In the back seat.

Dequan and Kelly stand outside, faces blank.

They look at each other. Then the wreckage ahead.

Charli’s car—exploded. Burned out.

Bodies inside.

Lynnie. August. Shylia. Charli.

A singed note sits on the dashboard.

seriously bitch you killing us wow
i thought u was cool
but no
yk
fuck you
Kelly picks it up. Reads it. Lets it go.

Wind carries it into the woods.

They open the doors. Get in the car.

KELLY

You ready?

DEQUAN

Nope.

They drive forward.

Full speed.

Straight off a cliff.

SPLASH.

 
INT. NEWSROOM – DAY

A clean, sterile news studio. The opposite of everything we’ve seen.

REPORTER (V.O.)

Authorities have recovered several bodies from a house fire and two more from a river nearby.

Footage flashes across the screen—charred bodies. The ruined house.

REPORTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)

What happened that night remains unclear.

Cops go through recovered phones. One lights up. It’s Samira’s.

They press “play” on the last voicemail.

BECK (V.O.)

hey we have a fun idea, vaca tn at my airbnb???

BAILEY (V.O.)

bring everyone. like… everyone.

1lour3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1lour3f/friends_want_to_get_together_but_dont/,Friends Want To Get Together But Don't,"It is so hard to get together with people now. I get that people have lives and work and everything but it was never this hard to get together with people. 

It happened around the time of the pandemic where people would just want to stay in rather than going out and even activities we could do online like gaming were even abandoned. My friends are constantly saying things like oh yea lets get together but when I come back at them with something like ok I'm good to meet on the following days they just disappear like a Facebook Marketplace message :/ I'm not even joking when I say it used to be as simple as meeting for coffee after work and now even just to do that it requires a damn month of planning.

On top of that everyone is so sensitive now adays where if I even mention to them about how flaky they're being the friendship will be over. Has anyone else experienced this and found a solution? I'm genuinely getting depressed from not being able to hang out with people. I am always so compromising in every meetup as well where I'm the one to drive to them, I'm the one to pay, I'm the one to be ok with the fact that they pick the day, location, and time and then they're still an hour late.

>A mysterious murder. A missing maid. A hidden affair. A will. And a surprise return.  
*Brazenville has secrets. And they’re no longer buried.*  
*(\~15 minute read, ends on a cliffhanger)*

\*\*\*

“*Another death at Osborne Manor,”* read the headline in *The Brazenville Post. “Lily Osborne, the last surviving member of the Osborne family, was found hanging from a ceiling fan in her bedroom yesterday morning. Sources suggest it may have been staged, but the official report is yet to come. Chief Investigator James Merryweather declined to comment further.*”

George tossed the paper toward Rick. “What do you think?”

Rick sipped his coffee. “Too early to say.”

“We need something soon. The agency’s barely afloat.”

Rick nodded slowly. “There’s more to this one, though.”

“You mean the Michael Osborne murder?”

“Possibly.”

George raised an eyebrow. “So, we’re taking the case?”

“James called himself. I figure it’s a good chance. Plus, you two can have a reunion,” Rick teased gently.

George shot Rick a glare. “He could’ve told us before joining the police. But…fine. When do we leave?”

“Thirty minutes.”

\---

At half past eleven, the two arrived at Osborne Manor, which sat on the outskirts of Brazenville beneath a heavy sky. Despite the morning mist lifting, the place retained a strange gloom. It seemed to have some dark secrets buried in it, waiting for someone to set them free.

James greeted them at the door. “Didn’t expect you’d actually come.”

“At least someone still understands friendship,” George said dryly.

“I deserve that,” James admitted, looking down. “I hope to make it up once we figure this out.”

“We’ll talk later,” Rick interjected gently. “Catch us up on the details.”

James straightened slightly. “Lily Osborne’s body was discovered by Mrs Turner, the part-time housekeeper who started working after the previous maid, Emma Vale, *disappeared*.”

“And Emma Vale disappeared…when exactly?” Rick asked.

“We’re not sure exactly, sometime shortly after Henry Thorne, the gardener was arrested for Michael Osborne’s murder.”

“Okay, go ahead”

“Mrs Turner, panicked after seeing the body, immediately called the police.”

“Did she touch anything?”

“She claims she didn’t touch a thing.”

“Is she available for interrogation?”

“Yes”

“Fine then, we’ll begin with her.”

“Sure, let’s move into the house, the clouds are looming over, seems like it’ll rain soon.”

The three men entered the Manor. The doors creaked as they opened. The interior was even gloomier, and felt heavy. There was a huge hall right at the entrance, with several small passages leading to different rooms. To the right of the hall stood the guest room, directly opposite one of the servant’s quarters. Beside the main bedroom, there were stairs leading up to the first floor having two smaller rooms, which were unoccupied. 

“She’s in the guest room,” James said, lowering his voice. “Hasn’t spoken much since the body was taken away. ”

“Let’s not keep her waiting, then.” Rick replied.

In the dim light of the guest room, a middle aged woman sat on the edge of the recliner. Her hands were pale, and face was white, like the one which has been through shock recently. Upon seeing the men, she rose gently.

“Please keep sitting, Mrs Turner. ” James said politely. “These are Rick and George, and they are investigating the case privately. If you would be kind enough to answer the questions they have regarding the case, it would help us move forward with the investigation.”

“Yes, yes… Ofcourse, ” she said, with a shivering voice.

“Please relax, Mrs Turner. We won’t keep you long. I first request you to tell me your full name,” said Rick.

“Alice Turner”

“How long have you been working here?”

“Three months.”

“Did you ever meet Emma Vale, the previous housekeeper?”

Mrs. Turner shook her head. “No, she had disappeared by the time I joined. But her name was still on a couple of old pantry labels and linen records. I once saw her signature in an old register the day I joined. I think it was the attendance book. James said to ignore it, that it was outdated.”

George frowned. “An attendance book?”

“Yes, the staff used to log in hours worked, back when there were more people here. I believe they stopped updating it soon after Emma disappeared and Thorne got arrested.”

“Did you know that Emma stayed back in the servant's quarters? Did Lily have similar provisions arranged  for you?”

“I didn't know about Emma. But I was told about the servant's rooms and was given an option to stay there. I declined”

“Any particular reason?”

“I didn't feel… comfortable staying in the house at night” 

Rick noted this carefully. ""What exactly was your work, here at the Manor?”

“Usual household, cooking, cleaning, washing dishes, and laundry. Occasionally, when Mrs Osborne wasn’t well, I was told to look after Mia, until…” a grim sorrow loomed over her face.

“Until what?”

“Until last month, when Mia, her six month old infant died of pneumonia.”

“How did Mrs Osborne cope with the loss? Was she on medications?”

“She was depressed after her husband’s death and used to have sessions with her therapist, who had prescribed some drugs to deal with it. But after Mia’s death, her depression worsened, and she stopped having her sessions altogether. Last week, she had a panic attack while trying to sleep. I called the family doctor, and he made some changes in her medications.”

Rick and George exchanged a quick glance, then turned back to Mrs Turner. “During your work, did you ever see or find anything that seemed out of place or unusual?”

Turner’s eyes narrowed, and after giving Rick a thoughtful gaze, she took out a silver locket out of her pocket. “I found this in the servants’ quarters. Lily told me to keep it until someone claimed it.”

Rick examined it closely, noting the engraved initials “*H&E.*” He handed it to James. “Mind if we keep this?”

“Please do.”

“Now Mrs Turner, could you please narrate the events of yesterday morning?”

“I came at nine as usual. Lily didn’t respond when I knocked, so I assumed she was sleeping. I began my chores. Later, when she still didn’t answer, I opened the door. It wasn’t locked from inside. And… there she was.” Her voice trembled, and tears gathered. “Hanging.”

“Anything strange happened afterward?” George gently prompted.

Turner paused thoughtfully. “Actually…I saw *two masked men on a motorbike pass by*. It felt odd, but I didn’t mention it to the police, I was still in shock.”

“Yes, sure. Can I leave for now?”

Rick gave a polite nod, and Mrs Turner quietly stood up. She went out of the guest room, and soon a soft creak was heard at the front door. The room went silent again. Rick glanced out of the window. The sky was growing darker, and the wind outside had picked up slightly, making the curtain shift.

\---

“Looks like it’s going to rain,” George said, looking out too. “As if this place wasn’t gloomy enough already.”

Rick was thinking. Then, turning to James, he asked, “Mrs Turner mentioned something like an attendance register. Do you have that with you?”

James reached into the folder tucked under his arm and pulled out a worn-out brown register. “Yeah, I brought it in with me. But it’s outdated and hasn't been updated since Emma went missing.” He handed it over.

Rick opened it, and quickly went through the pages. His eyes paused for a second. “Hmm. Just wanted to confirm,” he said, closing it again and resting it on the table beside him.

“So, what next?” George asked. 

“Henry Thorne,” James said. “He was here on the night of the infamous Michael Osborne murder, arrested with no solid evidence. We should interrogate him next, since he's the only witness remaining from that night, after Emma went missing. I’ve arranged a temporary release for questioning. He should be here soon.”

A moment later, the main door opened. A uniformed officer entered, followed by a stout middle-aged man, with his wrists still in cuffs. He looked tired and unshaven.” 

James offered a chair to the man. “Have a seat, Mr Thorne”, he said. 

Thorne sat down stiffly, not saying a word. His eyes briefly flicked between the three men before resting on the floor. 

Rick leaned forward. “Good afternoon, Mr. Thorne. Thanks for being here. I’m Rick, and this is my colleague, George. We’re private detectives, investigating the case after the tragic death of Mrs Osborne. ”

Thorne looked at them, unfazed. After a brief pause, he spoke, “And, what do you want from me?”

“We’re here to talk about the night of Michael Osborne’s murder. We believe it might be connected to what happened to Lily. “

“I’ve already told the police everything,” Thorne muttered. “Didn’t stop them from locking me away.” 

“I understand. But sometimes the police miss what’s hidden between the lines,” Rick said calmly. “We’re not here to trap you. We’re here to listen, properly.”

Thorne’s lips tightened. “You won’t find anything new.”

“Let’s start simple,” said George. “Your name, and how long have you worked at the Osborne Manor?”

“Henry Thorne. Thirty years. I was hired by Michael’s father, William Osborne. Been here since Michael was a child.”

“You must’ve been close to the family, then.” Rick said.

Thorne shrugged. “I was just the gardener. Trusted, sure. But still staff.”“And what were you doing at the Manor at 3:30 a.m. the night Michael Osborne was murdered?”A pause.

“I can’t tell you that.”

“Still, you were there that night. You had a reason. A personal one. Someone you cared about.”

Thorne went pale and silent, his breathing became heavy.

“Emma wasn’t just a colleague, was she?”

George and James shared a confused glance, then turned back to Rick. Thorne looked away, his jaws tightened. “I don’t know what you’re talking about”, he said.

“You do recognize this locket, don’t you?” Rick showed him the silver locket taking it from James.

Thorne froze. He stared at the locket like he was looking through time. “Where did you find this?” he asked, voice low and unsteady.

“Where it was found doesn’t matter, Mr Thorne. What matters is where is Emma? The one to whom this belonged?”

A flush appeared over Thorne’s face. “I loved her”, he whispered.

“Then please let us help her.” Rick said.

“You can’t, she’s dead.”

“How can you be so sure?”

Thorne hesitated, his eyes drifting towards the window. “A couple of days after I was taken in,” he began slowly, “I asked one of the officers about her. He told me she’d been released on Mrs Osborne’s request. Said she was doing fine and still working at the Manor.” 

Rick nodded. 

“I started requesting updates, asked to see her, even write to her. Every time, they brushed it aside. Said they’d pass on the message. No reply ever came.”

“And then?” George asked.

“About a week after that, I woke up one morning to find a piece of paper pushed under my cell door. No envelope. No name. It said: *‘Emma’s been dealt with. You can stop looking.’*”

Thorne handed over the note to Rick, and the three men observed it carefully.

“Tell us what happened that night, Henry,” Rick urged gently.

Thorne took a breath. “We were together in the servant’s quarters that night. Me and Emma.”

Rick straightened slightly. “Together, as in…?”

Thorne didn’t look up. “Yes. We were in a relationship. Kept it quiet.”

“She stayed in the servant’s quarters,” Thorne continued, his voice distant. “I used to come by after midnight, when the household was asleep. That night was no different, until we heard the scream.”

“Who screamed?” Rick asked.

“Lily,” he replied, now leaning forward slightly. “It was sudden. Sharp. We rushed to the bedroom, only to find her lying on the bed, unconscious, with a small, needle-like mark on her neck.

“And you didn’t see Michael anywhere in the house?”

“No. I went looking. Emma stayed back with Lily, trying to wake her. I ran outside… through the kitchen door to the lawn. That’s when I saw them.”

“Them?”

“*Two men. Masked*. Running through the trees at the edge of the garden. I chased for a bit, but I’m not fast anymore. Lost them.” 

“And then?” Rick asked quietly.

“I came back. Emma was still with Lily, who had just begun to stir. We called the police. They soon found his body in the woods. He’d been stabbed multiple times, on the neck. There was a note in his pocket.”

“What did it say?”

“*Justice is served.* Written in red ink. Or maybe blood, I couldn’t tell.”

After a brief moment of silence, Rick continued, “Why didn’t the police pursue the masked men?”

“There was no trace left. No footprints, no tyre marks. Nothing usable. And I… well, I was the only person without an alibi.” 

“And Emma?” Rick’s voice softened.

“She was questioned and released. She continued to work at the Manor for a while.”

Rick studied him for a moment, then said gently, “Mr Thorne… could you please describe Emma, and your relationship with her?”

Thorne finally looked up. His eyes glistened. “Emma was the most beautiful woman I’d ever known.” 

There was a stillness in his voice.

“She had this… light in her. A kind heart. A quiet grace. But her life - it wasn’t kind to her.” 

“Her husband, Derek Blackwell, was a drunkard. Violent. I met her before she ever worked here. She used to come buy seeds from the gardening store I worked part-time at. One day, she came with a swollen lip. That was the first time we actually talked.”

Rick didn’t interrupt. 

“She didn’t say anything at first, but over time… she trusted me. Confided in me. Told me everything about Derek. I told her she needed to get out of it, but she was scared.” 

George nodded slowly. “And then she got the job at the Manor?”

Thorne nodded. “Yes. She requested a placement for Derek too. Said if he had work, maybe he’d stop drinking. She believed in second chances, even for him.”

“What happened after that?”

“One day, Lily noticed a bruise on Emma’s arm while she was folding linen. Asked about it. Emma broke down. Lily was furious. Derek was fired immediately. Emma filed for divorce soon after.”

Rick frowned. “And no one knew about you and her?”

“No. We kept it hidden. Lily might’ve suspected something later, but never asked. We met quietly, when the house was asleep. My lodge was just a few blocks away. Easy to slip in.”

He looked down at his cuffed wrists.

“And then came that night.”

Rick sat back slightly, digesting Thorne’s words. The room had fallen silent.

A sharp knock at the front door broke the silence. 

James stood. “That must be the police van.”

The three men rose with Thorne. Rick extended his hand, and after a brief hesitation, Thorne took it.

“I assure you Mr. Thorne, we’ll find the truth.” Said Rick. 

Thorne nodded, emotion flickering behind his tired eyes. James guided him out. The front door creaked again, and moments later, they heard the sound of the van starting outside. 

Rick and George remained still in the guest room. James joined them after a brief pause.

\---

Finally, George spoke, turning towards Rick, “Would you care to explain?”

“Explain what?” Rick asked

“Surely you didn’t just guess about Henry and Emma? The locket could’ve belonged to anyone.”

“*Sometimes, what we overlook ends up being the most telling.*”, Rick said, looking at James.

“What do you mean?”

“That register Mrs Turner mentioned… it had both Emma and Henry’s names signed in, side by side, almost every single day. Too regular. Too consistent. Then, there’s the locket which was found in the servant’s quarters where Emma lived. Not something she’d leave lying around if it were meaningless.”

George nodded slowly. “So you assumed…”

“I suspected,” Rick corrected. “The night of the murder, Henry was caught inside the Manor at a strange hour, yet has always refused to say why. It all started adding up. I took a shot.”

“Well,” said James, “that shot worked. We’ve got a whole new thread to follow now.”

“Let’s follow it, then.”

James gave a small nod. “Right. The master bedroom, where Lily’s body was found. We’ve kept it untouched, aside from removing the body for postmortem.”

Rick’s tone grew sharper. “Has the report confirmed it was suicide?”

“Not yet. We’ll have it by this evening.”

Rick exchanged a glance with George. “Let’s not waste time.”

The three men stepped into the hall, their footsteps dull against the aged wooden floor. They followed a narrow, curved passage that opened into a grand master bedroom. Despite the light outside, the room was dim, with heavy curtains drawn across the windows, casting a filtered gloom.

The room bore a quiet chaos. A king-sized bed sat in the center, flanked by two tall wooden cupboards and matching side tables. One side table had a cracked mirror and a lamp; the other was bare. The ceiling fan above hung low, and the light fixtures attached to it had all been wrenched out and lay shattered in a corner.

James stepped forward. “We’ve made sure not to disturb anything. The body was hanging from that fan when Mrs Turner found her.”

George gestured to the cupboards. “Which one belonged to Mrs Osborne?”

“The one on the left,” James replied.

Rick nodded. “Alright. Let’s go through both wardrobes, and then check the side tables.”

They began their search. Lily’s cupboard was neat, her dresses folded in drawers, blouses arranged in tidy rows, and her formal wear hung crisply on hangers.

All seemed ordinary until George paused.

At the very bottom of the cupboard, tucked beneath a winter shawl, was a thin piece of paper. Partially singed at one corner.

“Rick,” George said quietly, retrieving it carefully. “Have a look at this.”

Rick leaned over. The paper was scorched on one side, but the handwriting was legible — elegant, deliberate. And unmistakably personal.

“It’s a will,” George said. “And someone tried to burn it.”

Rick dusted the remaining ash off the edges of the will and squinted at the text, reading aloud:

“.*..I, Lily Osborne, being of sound and deliberate mind, declare this to be my final will. I leave the entirety of my estate, including the Osborne Manor, liquid assets, and personal effects, to Miss Emma Vale.*”

Silence. 

George blinked. “*Emma Vale?*”

James looked confused. “That must be old. Or a mistake.”

Rick slowly shook his head. “*It’s dated last week.*”

The three men exchanged glances, the gravity of the moment settling in. 

“She never believed Emma was dead,” Rick murmured. “Was she protecting her?”

Before anyone could respond, the sharp creak of the front door echoed through the hall, louder this time.

**Footsteps.**

Then a figure appeared in the bedroom doorway - *soaked from the rain, her coat clinging to her, hair damp, eyes wide and uncertain.* 

>“*I’m sorry for interrupting,*” she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

>“*I’m Emma Vale.*” 

No one moved. 

Rick took a slow step back. George’s jaw stiffened. 

James looked as if he’d seen a ghost. 

Emma’s eyes moved to the document still held in Rick’s hand. 

>“*And I think you’ve found something that belongs to me.*”

Some just coffee and a walk and some dinner/drinks. We’ve had some passionate kissing and caressing but all while out and about and haven’t been alone together yet. Last night we were flirting on WhatsApp about sex and it’s on the cards soon but then she says we’d need to address some “practicalities” which I took to mean using a condom but she said she is very particular and wants me to have an STI test and send her the results. Just to say here that I’m a professional guy in my late 40s. I don’t sleep around and always use a condom when I do have sex as I don’t want an STI or a pregnancy so nothing I have done or said would give her any particular cause for concern that I’d have an STI above the risk there is with any sexually active person.

She said that she would send me her results and she would go on the pill and that would allow sex without a condom which is tempting as they are a pain. In 25+ years of dating I’ve never been asked for an STI test before sex. I’m also not comfortable with the idea of not using a condom esp with a woman I’ve only known a short time. She is a professional with a busy career and a child already so I don’t think she is looking to get pregnant (by saying she is on the pill but not being) but you never know. I’ve no objection to STI tests and know they are easy and free so that’s not the point. 

I like this woman and we get on great so this did catch me off guard a little. I’m thinking to get an STI test but if we do end up having sex I’d still use a condom. Interested in people’s thoughts on this one.

Edit: thanks for all the replies. I should have added that I got divorced last year after a 15 year marriage so am relatively new back on the dating scene so still learning about the norms. ",37,1751351804.0,AskIreland,75,0.86,False

1lounls,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lounls/acquaintence_making_uncomfortable_comments/,Acquaintence Making Uncomfortable Comments Frequently - Help!," I (32f) have this friend (?), who we’ll call Amie. Amie is 10 years younger than me, and we met at a hole in the wall cafe. We got to talking, because in this cafe you can’t really sit and not talk to someone (it’s that small), and became acquainted with one another. 

 I frequent this place fairly often, because its out of the way, and a if you know you know kind of place that doesn’t get much traction. Since meeting me, Amie has also begun to show up on a semi-frequent basis. Problems started to arise when they suggested we meet up outside of the cafe. I agreed - they wanted to go shopping in the city, as did I, so on we went. They asked some pretty probing questions about me, sexual orientation and such. I’m ace, and their first question was ‘how can you be sure unless you’ve been with a woman/man’. After briefly explaining my dating history (one boyfriend, long term relationship but didn’t work out), they went quiet for a bit… then promptly asked if I’d ever been in a relationship with a woman. 

I explained that I had previously had a friend, who was bi, and the friendship ended because she kept trying to ‘convince’ me that I should ‘try’ being a lesbian… (this, sadly, is a true story - I have nothing against anyone who is gay, but if someone refuses to hear the word *no*, I get a bit upset. The friendship ended, and I avoid the person if I ever see them now (which is rare, thankfully).

 I’ve noticed this weird trend though lately where every time I see Amie, they make a sexual reference. We’ve met up outside the cafe and driven to cities (always for shopping), over the last month, maybe three or four times now, and each and every time, they’ve made some untoward sexual references or comment. It’s always completely out of the blue and unpresidented, and usually in crowded places, as if they want others to hear. 

We made an uncharted, unexpected stop at a sex-toy shop on the way into the city once (they happened to be driving this time) because they claimed they wanted to buy something for themselves but wanted support, but once we got there, acted completely natural and at home. When the assistant asked if we were together and looking for something as a couple, Amie laughed, and acted affronted when I quickly set the record straight.

 They’ve made what I would call derogatory comments regarding a woman’s body parts, laughing it off as a joke when I’ve asked them not to use certain terms because they made me uncomfortable, and one time recently blasted *very explicit* music in the car that was all about sexual relations between two women, afterwards asking me what my thoughts were. 

Before anyone asks, I have, in no uncertain terms, told them that I’m not interested in sex, with anyone, and that there’s no chance of me changing my mind any time soon. (We had this discussion uncomfortably early on in our acquaintance, but because I’m an honest person and quite happy to be open about who I am, at the time I didn’t think anything of it, and they were asking why my last relationship ended) but they don’t seem to be getting it.

 I am not a prude - and I have friends on all sides of the LBGTQ+ spectrum. I honestly really don’t care what someone’s orientation or preference is, or if they’re experimenting because they don’t know themselves etc,  as long as it isn’t forced on me. I’ve told Amie that I am asexual, and I’ve explained what that is, in case they don’t understand, (I even went as far as to tell them that I’m aromantic as well, but I’m not sure this is true - but wanted to stave off any potential attempt at a romantic “friendship”) but this behaviour continues. The last time I was in the afore mentioned cafe, they showed up, and cheerfully made a very sexual comment to the whole cafe about women’s body parts in the heat, looking straight at me and grinning as they said it, as if we were in on the same joke despite me looking uncomfortable and going very quiet.

I don’t know what to do. I am getting very uncomfortable with the whole thing, and seriously considering switching where I get coffee, which I don’t really want to do. 

I’ve asked my parents what they thought - huge mistake, my father told me that Amie was “probably just having a laugh”, and my mother told me that “it’s your fault, you attract these kinds of people because you’re confident” -AITA, is this my fault or/and I overthinking? And if not what the hell do I do?

Edit: I forgot to add that I’ve avoided going anywhere with her since the music-in-the-car incident, thankfully I’ve been able to use the weather as a reasonable excuse not to travel lately. ",1,1751351666.0,AITAH,5,0.67,False

To my surprise I saw a commercial 2-group machine behind the bar with Gemilai branding. I’m sure we’re all familiar with the “owl” home machine at this point but I have never seen one their commercial machines here in the US. I was not able to get a photo but it looked like a riff on the Aurelia wave to me.

I’ve been curious how their commercial machines are since I’ve seen their 2 groups going for ~$2,500 USD on certain websites. Although i can’t seem to find this particular machine listed anywhere. 

The cappuccino was OK. The barista pulled the shot in about 8 seconds and said he had just recently learned what a cortado is. I imagine he was not bringing out the best in the machine. 

Any idea what the machine name might be?Has anyone else encountered these outside of Asia? ",1,1751351611.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

But there is video evidence of me being on the floor although it is accessed by other team members as well throughout the night, i dont know what i am supposed to do, i thought no one would notice but that guy as soon as he walked into work today asked us if anyone went to the maintenance room some of the stuff is missing.
What do i do?, will i get caught?, do they have to have evidence of me actually taking the vape to fire me? Should i be worried?",1,1751351588.0,AskOldPeopleAdvice,2,0.99,False

I had told her at the end of the date I was free the next day if she wanted to hang out again before she went home (she lives 5hrs away but is moving here). Next day she said she was feeling kinda socially exhausted after spending the previous night with a friend. So she was just gonna have a quiet day and head home. We text a bit and then it went quiet. The day after I noticed she had disappeared from my chats on hinge. We had exchanged Instagram and she is still following me but hasn't seen any of the stories I've posted. It's been 48 hrs no text or anything. I figured I'd text her tomorrow night but is the combo of socially exhausted and deleting hinge a clear sign she wasn't it me? The texting and pictures during the hike After we met are whats thrown me off. I figured continued contact after the date seemed to be a good sign? ,1,1751351551.0,dating_advice,7,0.6,False

1loujqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1loujqo/conductor_of_the_poop_train/,Conductor of the poop train.,"Two weeks post op today  - Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy, Bilateral Salpingectomy w/ surgery for endometriosis. 

A brief bit of lore to preface: Constipation and my body is like Samwise to Frodo. Consistent. Loyal. Unwavering. A typical BM equated to one unsatisfactory movement per week that felt like the journey to Modor. Exhausted, numb legs and wishing the eagles would carry me away from my misery. 

However, every bowel movement since surgery it feels as if some malignant entity has risen from the depths of the sewer system and into the comfort and privacy of my bathroom. Through manipulation of some supernatural phenomena manages to effectively pull the rip cord on my bowel contents. Push? I was concerned about pushing? A mere flex and ... 10 seconds. That feels generous... Maybe 6-8 seconds and I am done. Never knew it was possible to poop such a volume daily (this is just crazy) and so fast that is rivals the Shanghai Maglev. IT FRIGHTENS ME.

Is this what it is like for normal people who joke about morning coffee poops?!

Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this sensation post surgery?

This morning there was blood in my stool but I think I can equate that to overdoing it the day prior. Maybe?

Side note: Thank you so much to everyone in this sub. For someone that doesn't have their first post op check in until end of August - the collective experience in here has assuaged so many worries. ",4,1751351252.0,hysterectomy,3,0.84,False

For a variety of reasons, I had very much wanted to go a hybrid school route (3 days in person) but it isn't in the cards for our family. I'm feeling so incredibly sad. I'm just going to miss him so deeply. I am trying so hard to focus on the things he will gain instead of what I am ""losing"" (time with him, late morning snuggles, hearing ""mama let's play,"" playing coffee shop in the mornings, and cooking show to prep dinner, making jumps out of magnatiles for monster trucks, building forts with his nugget, going on walks and finding leaves to paint, playing Pokemon with various stuffed animals, just living life with him. Mom guilt just came crashing down on me tonight because I realized it is just 31 days away and this stage is over. I began cleaning my house around 1:00am because I don't want a single second wasted with him. I have to be at work in 5 hours and I know I'll regret this decision then but the regret of missing these moments would be so much worse! I guess I just needed to better understand how other parents deal with this or maybe just people to say ""get over yourself lady."" 

It's the times I said ""hold on, mama has to make a call for work,"" or the times I was grumpy even hateful because he wouldn't go to sleep. I just feel regret about those things.

The biggest thing that got me is that one day a week, while he's snoozing away, I carry him down the stairs, load him in his car seat, put a blanket around him so he's cozy, drive him to my parents and put him in their bed before going to work.
